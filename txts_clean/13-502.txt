CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 13-502, Reed v. Town
of Gilbert.
Mr. Cortman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID CORTMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CORTMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The town's code discriminates on its face by
treating certain signs differently based solely on what
they say.  For example, political signs may be 32 square
feet, may be unlimited in number, and may be placed in
the right-of-way of the entire town for five months
before the election; but the church's signs can only be
one-fifth of that side -- size, only placed in the dark
of night, the night before the church service.
While the church's signs with directional
content are only allowed up for 14 hours, other signs
with directional content are allowed up for much longer.
For example, builders' directional signs to home sales
events are allowed up to be the entire -- are allowed up
the entire weekend, and homeowners' association event
signs are allowed to be up for 30 days.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what are -- what
are you seeking?  Do you -- do you want whatever is the
most favorable rule, say, for ideological signs?  Is
that what you want?  Or do you accept that it could be
some limit on event signs, say, some reasonable time
limit?
MR. CORTMAN:  We're -- we're seeking the
same as the -- the favorable signs, which, in this case,
would be both ideological and political signs.
And -- and the reason on that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the ideological isn't
time unlimited.
MR. CORTMAN:  Well, but it's not allowed on
the right-of-way, and so that's a major factor in this
case because political signs are allowed on the
right-of-way, and so the treatment that we're seeking is
merely equal treatment under the First Amendment.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The same treatment as
political signs, then, is that --
MR. CORTMAN:  The -- the same treatment as
political signs that are allowed up in the right-of-way,
that's right.
And ideological signs, interestingly enough,
are still based into their own content category, but
they are not allowed on the right-of-way, yet they are
allowed up for an unlimited period of time.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you -- are you
seeking unlimited placement?
MR. CORTMAN:  We are not.  We're seeking
placement that any other temporary signs get, which is
the category that we're talking about.
And, in fact, the -- the city, the town here
has freedom to regulate the amount of time signs can go
up, the size of the signs, the number of the signs.  All
our argument is, is that they do it across the board and
not treat signs differently based on their content.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your -- your
argument does not turn on the fact that it's a church's
sign, does it?  I mean, you -- your argument would be
the same if this is a temporary sign about where the
soccer game was going to be?
MR. CORTMAN:  Well, that's right.  And --
and the church's sign merely adds additional components
to it.  For example, the town puts our -- the church's
sign into a category called directional signs; but, yet,
the church's sign has religious speech on it.  It has,
obviously, directional speech.  It has ideological
speech.  But that's correct, it's -- it's equal
treatment for that type of sign.
And -- and the category --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask about the category
for political signs, which is the most favorable?
Because all the time this Court says that political
speech is the most valued kind of speech.  It's at the
heart of the First Amendment.  It gets special First
Amendment protection.  So in a way, why aren't --
isn't -- isn't the locality here basically adopting the
same kind of category-based understanding of political
speech and its special rule and First Amendment analysis
that this Court has very frequently articulated?
MR. CORTMAN:  But I think this Court has
also said, for example, that -- that religious speech
also handles that category of core speech under the
First Amendment.  And the problem is, is what the --
what the town does here, it's valuing speech, and I
think that is one of the problems.  It is saying that
political speech in this case is more valuable than an
invitation to church.
And so I think this Court has made clear
that -- that the government --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I'm sorry.
That was the significance of my prior question.
What -- what they're really saying is that
political speech is more valuable than speech about
where the soccer game is.  In other words, I thought you
indicated that your argument did not depend on the fact
that the sign was a sign for the church.
MR. CORTMAN:  Well, that's right.  It
doesn't depend on that fact.  I was merely referring to
the facts of this case.  I apologize --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Don't you think that
political speech is more valuable than directions to the
soccer game?
MR. CORTMAN:  Maybe in some people's eyes,
but the problem we have is -- is should the government
be deciding what speech is more valuable than others,
because that is exactly what it did in this case.  It
has said that, in fact, your speech is not valuable and
we can completely ban it.  And I think one of the
problems --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, let's -- let's
take a sign that in all other ways is equal except that
it says no signs on residential property except
properties that are being sold.  And so it's valued the
homeowner's right to sell its property.  Would that be
contrary of  the First Amendment, and if not, why is that
value any different than valuing political speech?
MR. CORTMAN:  I think it would be.  I think
this Court's case Linmark dealt with a similar
circumstance, where in that city, it banned all
residential signs except for -- in fact, it was the
reverse.  It banned for sale signs and allowed some
residential signs that were exceptions.
But this Court said exactly that, that the
town shouldn't value different types of speech,
especially on private property when you have homeowners'
rights that also comes into play in addition to speech
rights.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it's commercial and
it relates to a one-time event.  For example, for a yard
sale.
MR. CORTMAN:  Right.
JUSTICE ALITO:  If the State and the city
allow election-related signs to be put up in the
right-of-way, then anybody who has a yard sale has an
equal right?
MR. CORTMAN:  Well, I think -- I think
commercial speech, under this Court's jurisprudence, can
be treated differently, and that's one of the important
things.  The category here is narrow because government
speech -- government can put up whatever signs that it
would like.  It doesn't trigger any problem under the
First Amendment.
We hear a lot in the other briefs about
warning signs and other types of signs.  The government
is free to put up all the signs that it would like
without triggering this problem.  Commercial speech is
also in a different category, according to this Court.
So the narrow category that we're talking
about is temporary signs, not permanent signs, that are
put up in the right-of-way that can be regulated.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think directional
signs is a valid category?
MR. CORTMAN:  The reason I don't think it is
is because here, the direction is part of the invitation
to come and worship or part of the invitation to come to
a different event.  So the directional part of it is in
addition to the ideological speech, the invitation to
come in and worship.  And so although it appears to be a
different category of directional, it's important to the
speech of the church, inviting the community and saying
come worship with us, and here is where we are located.
And what's interesting about that, if the
church, for example, says we're meeting now at a senior
living center, that is considered to be a directional
sign because the definition is a sign that is intended
to invite and direct someone to your service, that would
then be banned in the right-of-way.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I guess you see the
concern, if an affluent person wants to celebrate a
birthday, he can put "Happy birthday, Uncle Fred" as
many places as a political sign, and as for long.
MR. CORTMAN:  Well, I think one of the
issues is if the government has decided that its
interest -- which, by the way, is what drives this, the
interest in safety and aesthetics, which is the two
interests the government proposes.  If those have
already been deemed to be less important than speech,
then I think speech should be allowed.  But --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your answer to the
question is "Happy birthday, Uncle Fred" can have as
many signs and for as long as the political campaign.
MR. CORTMAN:  I think -- I think that is
right.  And I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That has -- that has to
be -- seem to me -- what about historical marker, the
birthplace of James Madison or whatever?
MR. CORTMAN:  I think the answer to that is
the government is free to put up that marker without
any --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no, it's privately --
privately owned.
MR. CORTMAN:  Well, I think if it's -- if
it's allowing private speech, then we engage in the
problem of valuing.  For example, in that case, we think
that marker is more important than someone else's
speech.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So again, under your view,
"Happy birthday, Uncle Fred" and "Save your soul" and
"Birthplace of James Madison" can all be up for the same
length of time, same size.
MR. CORTMAN:  I think it can, because
otherwise I think we have a problem with content-based
discrimination --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about permanent signs?
I assume that what you say about temporary signs would
apply equally to permanent signs, wouldn't it?
MR. CORTMAN:  It would, but in a different
category.  In other words, our category that we're
discussing is temporary signs, so ours wouldn't affect
permanent signs.  I believe you could make -- that's a
content-neutral category.
But if you had a permanent sign, I think
within the permanent sign category, the answer is --
category --
the same --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Within the permanent sign
MR. CORTMAN:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- they all have to have
MR. CORTMAN:  I believe so, because --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- except commercial, I
assume.
MR. CORTMAN:  And especially if -- most of
the permanent signs are commercial signs.  When we talk
about billboards and other types of signs, so this Court
I think has made clear if you have, for example,
billboards and other permanent signs that do allow
commercial speech, then the municipality must allow
noncommercial speech.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, you
characterize --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what would happen if
one church has a -- always meets in the same place and
it wants to put up a sign that says, every Sunday this
is the place to go, and another church moves around, so
it wants to put up a temporary sign.  Do they have to be
treated the same?
MR. CORTMAN:  I think they would.  If we're
talking about the category of what goes on public
property, what goes on the right-of-way.  On their own
property is a different question.  But here, the town
has already decided to allow an unlimited number of
political signs up to 30 square -- 32 square feet for
nearly the entire year.  There are four elections in
Arizona, so with this time limit of five months, you
have political signs in an unlimited number.  And those
signs affect the safety and aesthetics interest the same
way as the church's sign does, the same way as an
invitation --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you create your
temporary category without reading the sign?  And
so there is some force, the counterargument that what is
being regulated here is not the content but the function
of the sign.  So how do you get around that argument?
Because you've already created a category that requires
you to read the sign.
MR. CORTMAN:  I don't think it does, and the
reason the way the temporary sign is defined here is
merely a sign that's both  intended and constructed not
to be permanent.  So it doesn't matter what is on that
sign; that's why we think that category is content
neutral, because as long as it's a temporary sign, it
doesn't matter what the sign says.  A permanent sign is
just duration, and there can be duration requirements,
there can be size requirements, location requirements.
That the government --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your point is if
it's -- if it's stuck in the ground with a little
stake --
MR. CORTMAN:  Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- then it can be
treated one way, but if it's in concrete -- but --
MR. CORTMAN:  That's right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me that
you are trying to find a, I don't know, a difficult way
to deal with an issue that could be readily addressed
just by seeing if the sign is for a limited event.  In
other words, what if somebody -- every time -- you know,
the stake in the ground at least could last for three
weeks, so every three weeks, they come along and stick
the stake back in the ground.  You are saying the only
way they can distinguish is by looking at whether it has
a stake in the ground or whether it's in concrete, and
yet that seems to me that doesn't help the -- that
doesn't answer the city's legitimate concern.
MR. CORTMAN:  But I think what is important
here is that  if the city, the town has already
agreed that an election is an event, and so we have an
election that's an event, but yet that single event sign
can be up for five months, and yet we have an event
where that single event can only be up overnight.  And
so it's already made that determination that it would
allow those types of signs for what I think is a
comparable use, a single event to a single event.
The other thing I would say is if you allow
signs to be up for one single event for five months,
certainly there should be some way to say, well, if we
have a recurring event as we do here, certainly the sign
should be allowed up at least equal to the same time,
and --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I mean, to say that
an election is a single event in the same way as a
football game, a cookout, a basketball championship,
it's -- it seems to me is a very difficult thing for
this Court to have to decide.  It's just not -- a
political campaign is a dynamic that goes on for some
weeks that the signs initiate a discussion. Now I can see
where you can say the religious sign does or at least
should initiate the same discussion of -- on issues that
are certainly of the same importance, if not more.
MR. CORTMAN:  Certainly --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it seems to me you are
forcing us into making a very wooden distinction that
could result in a proliferation of signs for birthday
parties or for every conceivable event that could be up
for five months.
MR. CORTMAN:  But I think the problem is
there -- there already is that here, because we have an
unlimited number of political signs.  And so if the
streets are already littered in an unlimited number of
political signs, which they are, then how serious is the
town's interest to reduce clutter?  And I think that's
the problem.  The way to reduce clutter is to say, for
example, many different ways, you can only have one sign
per block, five signs total.  It could only be a certain
size.
But it's hard to take the interests
seriously of reducing clutter when it allows political
signs to clutter the entire town in an unlimited number
for the entire year.  The church's signs or an event
signs are not the problem.  What we have here is -- is
carte blanche authority for political signs to clutter
the landscape, unlimited in number for the entire year,
and yet the concern is for maybe a few more signs that
may be placed.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Can the town say that signs
relating to a one-time event, an election or anything
else that occurs on a particular date, have to be taken
down within a period of time after that event?  And if
can say that, isn't that content-based, the way you
define that concept?
MR. CORTMAN:  I don't believe it is.  In
fact, the Washington, D.C., municipal regulations have
that exact code, and -- and it's one that we would
recommend to the Court.  I believe it's 13605.
And what it says is all temporary signs
should be treated the same, period.  You can put -- you
have to put your date on the sign for when you put it
up.  Every temporary sign can be up for 180 days.  If
it's tied to an event, after the event is over, it needs
to be down 30 days after the event.
I think -- our opinion is the reason that is
content-neutral is whenever something is over, if your
store is closed, the event is done, then the sign can be
removed.  But the important part is every sign can be up
for the same amount of time, even if it is that event
that's over now.  And I think that's the way you
deal with these -- these single event --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought you said the way
you distinguish between temporary signs and permanent
signs is based on the -- the nature of the sign, not
what it says.
MR. CORTMAN:  Right.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So that gets you over the
problem Justice Sotomayor mentioned about having to read
the sign.
MR. CORTMAN:  Right.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But if this -- if there's a
rule that says the sign has to be down within a certain
period of time after the date of the event, which is on
the sign, I don't see how you get around to reading the
sign.
MR. CORTMAN:  Well, what you would be
reading is the date, and -- and the code requires the
date to be placed on the sign both for when the sign is
placed and -- and for -- you know, for what the event
is.  But I think that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So if somebody puts up a
sign for a yard sale two days before the yard sale, then
they can -- that can stay up for 48 days after the yard
sale?  It has 50 days or whatever the period of time is?
MR. CORTMAN:  Yes, according to -- according
to the code.  But what is interesting, that time period
can be anything the town desires.  It -- it doesn't need
to be -- and we're not looking for signs all year long.
The town can say, for example, temporary
signs can be up for seven days, they can be a certain
size.  Like Washington, D.C., does, you can only have
three signs per block, have to be spaced out.  And --
and that's part of our point.
And I think one of the things to take a --
to take look at is the amici brief that's been filed on
behalf of the town by the National League of Cities, and
the reason that brief is important, for example, on
page 10 and 13, it lists dozens and --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What page?
MR. CORTMAN:  Page 10 of the amici brief on
behalf of the National League of Cities on behalf of the
town.  And the reason I point out this brief is we don't
believe that the content-neutral regulation would tie
the hands of the town because, as -- as they say, there
are dozens and dozens of ways to regulate signs on a
content-neutral way.  For example, and this has to do
with permanent signs --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What page is this again?
MR. CORTMAN:  This is page 10 on the
National League of Cities' amici brief.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Got it.
MR. CORTMAN:  It says you can regulate
locational criteria, off-site signs, number of signs,
spacing, setbacks, placement criteria, roof sign, ground
signs, wall signs, projecting signs.  And all my point
is, as we look through their brief, there are
innumerable ways for the Court -- excuse me -- for the
town to regulate signs.
There is no reason to look at the content of
the sign, and the reason is the content of the sign
affects the -- the government interest of safety and
aesthetics in the same way.  If -- if you have, for
example, clutter, whether it's the church's sign or a
political sign, it's going to clutter the roadways the
same way.
So the way to deal with clutter is an easy
rule, and, in fact, even the town concedes that the
content-based test that this Court has -- has used and
that the majority of the circuits now use in the sign
context -- the First Circuit, the Second Circuit, the
Eighth Circuit, and the Eleventh apply this test to sign
codes, and what they say, it's actually easier for the
town because you don’t--
JUSTICE BREYER:  For the towns it might be.
What about there are vast areas of the country where
there is scenery and people want to keep the scenery the
same, and they don't want signs at all, but they don't
want to say no signs because someone who wants to put up
a sign that says Geronimo is buried 50 feet away from
here.
MR. CORTMAN:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, if they say, okay,
we'll make an exception for that, does that mean that
they have to have an exception for everything, and
pretty soon the entire State of Wyoming is just filled
with clutter?
MR. CORTMAN:  I wouldn't say everything.
But what I would say is -- is content-neutral
categories.  But they can say, for example, each person
could --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, it's not a
content-neutral category.  What it is, is it is a
category that says if you want to say Geronimo is buried
here you can, because that will bring people to look at
the grave, and that's it; we don't want anything else.
We're trying to keep the place looking nice.
Now, that's not a city.  Cities are filled
with clutter anyway, at least most parts.  But that's --
so -- so what is -- I'm trying to drive at what is your
definition of "content-neutral," which is something that
I wonder since I think the entire U.S. Code is filled
with content distinctions.  All of crime is filled with
content distinctions.  All of regulation has content
distinctions.
So what is it precisely in respect to the
content-neutral rule that is consistent with the U.S.
Code and is consistent with the example, if any, that I
gave?
MR. CORTMAN:  The definition we would
propose is the same one this Court has used since the
Mosley case about what is content-based, and that is if
there -- the restriction or the regulation looks at the
subject matter, looks at --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, try -- try the criminal
code and solicitation, where if you solicit for certain
things you commit serious crimes, and if you commit
certain -- solicit for certain other things, they are
less serious and so forth.  We all know that.  How does
your definition apply there?
MR. CORTMAN:  Well, I don't think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Or how does it apply -- you
see, I'm -- I'm confused.  I understand the words --
MR. CORTMAN:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- but I just have never
been able to understand how they apply in many cases.
MR. CORTMAN:  Only limited here to -- to
free speech questions, not criminal laws, not --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, I'm sorry.  There's
a free speech question under criminal law.  Does the
First Amendment permit solicitation of drugs to be
punished less or more seriously?  You understand what I'm
driving at --
MR. CORTMAN:  I do.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- think of the U.S. Code,
and what I want and hoping for is enlightenment.
MR. CORTMAN:  I think if there is -- it's a
conduct-related offense, we don't get into free speech.
If there is a free speech offense, even under the Code,
I believe this Court's cases say, for example, there are
vagueness cases where there are criminal laws.  This, in
fact, is a criminal law.  If you continue to put up your
signs, you could actually get fined and jail time.  So I
believe the First Amendment would also apply if it's
speech-related.
An answer to your hypothetical, I think
there are many ways for the locality to regulate those
signs.  For example, if it doesn't want many signs, it
can say one person can put up a temporary sign or a
permanent sign or whatever have you.
But to say, for example, you could put up a
private sign because you think this one location is
interesting, what if another person has a location they
want people to come visit?  Should the government be
able to say, well, we think your location is important,
but your location is not.
And our response is the government could put
up the sign if it -- if it wants to make that choice
about historical landmarks or other types of signs or
directional types of signs.
I -- I'd like to reserve the remainder of
time for rebuttal if I may.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
Mr. Cortman.
Mr. Feigin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN.
FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY
MR. FEIGIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
We agree with Petitioners that Respondents'
ordinance here is unconstitutional, but we think that a
context-specific intermediate scrutiny approach should
apply in evaluating speech-permissive exceptions to a
sign ordinance where those exceptions are based on the
same longstanding traditional rationales that justify
the sign ordinance as a whole.
A wooden application of strict scrutiny in
this context would suggest that it's presumptively
unconstitutional, for example, for a town to limit signs
on public property but have an exception if you want to
paint your street number on your curb.
Now, that doesn't make a great deal of
practical sense, and that's not an example I just made
up.  That's essentially the ordinance that this Court
upheld, albeit without specifically addressing this
particular issue, in Taxpayers for Vincent.
On a theoretical level, the normal reasons
for deep judicial skepticism of exceptions to a
regulation of speech don't apply in the context of that
street address exception, exceptions for danger or
safety signs, or other types of exceptions that track
the normal safety and nonproliferation rationales for a
sign regulation.  Those kinds of exceptions don't create
any inference that the government is attempting to favor
one viewpoint or another, that it's trying to limit the
set of ideas that are going to come into the public
marketplace, or that it doesn't truly believe in the
safety and nonproliferation rationales that underlie the
sign regulation as a whole.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I mean, you --
you obviously know the difficulty with that, which is
how does the government decide when there should be an
exception or how does a court decide when there should
be an exception and when there shouldn't be?  I mean, I
understood the whole point of the strict scrutiny for
content-based restrictions is to find out which are the
types of speech or the particular types of regulation
that should be given an exception, rather than starting
with saying, well, you don't apply this scrutiny because
there ought to be an exception.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, I think the main problem
with strict scrutiny in this context is it sends a
signal to legislatures that they are on safer ground if
they enact a broad and undifferentiated restriction on
signs than if they try to tailor it only to those types
of signs that actually cause the problem that they are
trying to prevent.
And I think that the way the Court can
manage the situation is to see whether, under
intermediate scrutiny, there really are safety and-or
nonproliferation rationales that track onto whatever
exception is being drawn.
So if we could use, for example, Justice
Sotomayor's example of the "For Sale" signs.  A town
might permissibly have an ordinance that limits the
number of signs you can have on your lawn to two, two
signs of any type; but it might also say, you know,
we're not going to count "for Sale" signs against your
quota of two and the reason is that "For Sale" signs are
only up on a very small percentage of properties at any
given of time, they are up for a very limited purpose
when the property is for sale, and they go down once the
sale is consummated.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you want us to sort --
sort these ordinances out one by one and examine each of
these exceptions and say, you know, this is okay and
this isn't okay?  I don't know that the Federal
Judiciary is numerous enough to do that, and it's a much
more simple rule that the other side presents:  Treat
all signs the same.  If clutter is the problem, they all
clutter.  And you shouldn't -- you shouldn't allow or
disallow on the basis of the message.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, it's a simple
rule, but I think it's an extremely impractical rule
that is going to foreclose experimentation and local
solutions to local problems.
Let me give you another example of a town
that has some sort of sign restriction, but it doesn't
apply that sign restriction to safety signs like
"Children at Play" or "Hidden Driveway Ahead."  If you
are going to apply strict scrutiny to those kinds of
exceptions, they are probably not going to pass muster
unless it's a really watered-down version of strict
scrutiny that I think is unfamiliar to the courts.
There is actually a fairly robust
empirically --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is the problem?  You
make -- you make your sign limits big enough that those
signs will attract attention, that's all.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, I think towns
legitimately should not have to be put to the choice if
they want to prevent the proliferation of signs that
would cause safety problems --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or have the town put up the
signs, in which case they can be as big as the town
wants.  We're just talking about private signs here.
MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I'm not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you're -- you're saying
every private individual has to have a big sign,
"Children At Play," right?
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, I don't want to resist
too hard the idea that the Government can put up any
signs it wants, but I think the reason we think the
Government could put up the signs here is not because
the Government can say that it can speak on certain
topics and private citizens can't, but because of the
nature of the signs that are being put up, which means
that some work has to be done here by the fact that the
types of signs I described are safety signs.
Now, if we’re going to subject  that kind of
exception to strict scrutiny, it turns out there's actually
a fairly robust empirical debate about whether "Children
At Play" signs or "Hidden Driveway Ahead" signs actually
do enhance safety.  And courts are going to have to make a
one-size-fits-all conclusion about whether the state of
the evidence, which right now is fairly equivocal,
justifies that sort of exception. I think courts are
likely --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I'm not
sure -- I'm not sure your whole approach is not
precluded by our decision in McCullen.  There, we said
that a facially neutral law does not become content-
based simply because it may disproportionately affect
certain types of certain topics.  And we said the
question in such a case -- in other words, when you are
dealing with a facially neutral law -- is whether the
law is justified without reference to the content.  So
it seems to me that you've got to get over the content
neutrality.  Your argument only applies when it's
content neutral and yet here we're dealing with a
situation where you're saying it's an exception to the
content-based rule.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think
the Court can deal with the competing interests in this
case more easily not by getting bogged down in the
definition of content-based and content-neutral, which I
can address in a second, but by focusing more on the
bottom-line question of whether this is an appropriate
case for the application of strict scrutiny or
intermediate scrutiny.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When you use those labels
in the context of the First Amendment, do they mean the
same thing that they mean in equal protection?  That is,
intermediate scrutiny is a pretty tough standard in
equal protection.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, I think there are a
couple of flavors of intermediate scrutiny, both under
the Constitution at large and under the First Amendment
in particular.  I think here we would be urging
something more like a reasonable fit test, which we
think would give municipalities enough room to draw the
kinds of distinctions that I think they reasonably
should be able to make between painting your street
number on your curb so people can more easily find your
house and restrictions on, you know, particular types of
speech that are much more likely to be motivated by
disagreement with that speech.
We do think that intermediate scrutiny has a
fair amount of teeth in the circumstance, I mean, and
we're putting our money where our mouth is because we
think that the particular ordinance at issue here fails
intermediate scrutiny.
But intermediate scrutiny would give
municipalities enough room to draw these kinds of
distinctions and to draw, in particular, the kinds of
distinctions that are drawn in the Highway
Beautification Act, which allows certain types of signs
that do enhance safety and aesthetics, but generally
doesn't allow the ground on the sides of freeways to
become a breeding ground for signs which would decrease
driver safety and decrease appreciation --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think that a --
I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think that a
library could say big books are preferable to little
books and it so happens that big books are coffee books
and little books tend to be mostly political, so we're
going to put all the political books in the basement and
all the big books on the main floor?
Is that a distinction that the First
Amendment permits?
MR. FEIGIN:  I think a court might be
reasonably fairly skeptical of that kind of distinction.
But I think signs, Your Honor, present particular First
Amendment problems that the Court had to grapple with
and didn't quite resolve in MetroMedia and City of
Ladue.
One distinct problem with signs is that
the -- it's very difficult for legislatures to tailor
sign regulations and describe types of signs that it
doesn't think it needs to regulate to advance its
interest, thereby allow more speech, without describing
those types of signs in a manner that could be viewed as
content-based.  And that's what makes sign regulation
very difficult and why we think some sort of
context-specific rule in this circumstance would be
appropriate.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't see why.  I mean,
you say it, but why is it true?  Just make whatever the
sign requirement is big enough that any private signs
that need to get people's attention will get people's
attention.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What you say about signs I
assume applies to noise as well, right?  If the city has
a noise ordinance, it can distinguish between noises for
various purposes.  A political sound truck before an
election can be given a higher allowance, and, I don't
know, a street evangelist given a lower allowance.
MR. FEIGIN:  I don't think that would be
permissible, Your Honor.  I think one key here is that
the types of exceptions we're talking about, the only
types we think should be subject to intermediate
scrutiny, are ones that track the safety and
nonproliferation rationales for the sign ordinance as a
whole.  If the City is advancing a distinction based on
the fact that they think political speech or ideological
speech is more valuable than, say, religious speech, we
think that would be subject to strict scrutiny.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Savrin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP W. SAVRIN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SAVRIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The problem with applying strict scrutiny in
this case or this type of case is that it will have, we
believe, the opposite effect.  It will limit speech
because towns, cities will enact one size fits all.  In
order to do that, as Petitioner's counsel indicated,
there need to be limitations on the number of signs, on
the duration of signs.  The signs would have to be all
large enough to accommodate the largest message that
needs to be communicated.
And in order to pass strict scrutiny, the
legislatures in these towns and cities across this
country would be inclined to ban all signs except those
that the First Amendment absolutely allows.
JUSTICE ALITO:  You can make that argument
in all kinds of contexts.  I don't know where it gets
you.  Suppose that the question is, whether the town is
going to allow anybody to speak in a park, and the
town -- the town council says, well, you know, we would
like to have people be able to speak on subjects that we
like, but there are some subjects we really don't like.
We don't want people to speak on those.  So we have the
choice, we allow everybody to speak or we allow nobody
to speak.
So you can make exactly that same argument in lots
of other contexts where I don't think the distinction
could be justified.  Isn't that right?
MR. SAVRIN:  I think there is a difference,
Justice Alito, in signs as opposed to speech because
signs do take up physical space.  They displace other
uses of land, and they perform different functions.
One thing that we would like to emphasize in
this case is that the temporary directional sign
provision is limited to in signs that are intended to
guide travelers along a route from Point A to Point B.
If they have expressive content on them, then they are
no longer a directional sign but are then an expressive
sign; and there is a different provision that applies
for that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if the sign here said,
"We welcome you to attend our church service," and then
it says on the bottom, meeting place, and it specifies
the meeting place, but the message is "we welcome you to
attend our service," that's ideological?
MR. SAVRIN:  That is ideological.  That
would not be a directional sign because it's not
directing travelers along -- along the route to that
location.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it says also "welcome
you to attend our church service, it will be held at."
So it's giving the direction, but it's also expressing
the message that everyone is welcome to come worship.
MR. SAVRIN:  I believe the way that this
code has been interpreted, Justice Ginsburg, is that
that would not be a directional sign because it's not
saying turn right, turn left, go straight a few miles.
It's not giving directions about how to get there.
So I believe that that type of sign would be
permitted under this ordinance as an ideological sign
and would not be limited to the terms of the temporary
directional.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Savrin, could I ask what
the -- your justification is for these specially
generous provisions on ideological signs?  I mean,
putting aside the level of scrutiny, why do you have
these very generous rules for ideological signs as
compared to others?
MR. SAVRIN:  Well, specifically on the
ideological signs is to protect the First Amendment
right of anyone to speak on any topic at any time.  The
difference in the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you are not even
purporting to have a content-neutral justification for
this.  You are essentially saying, yes, we generally
dislike clutter, but we're willing to make exceptions
for clutter for speech that we think has special First
Amendment significance.
MR. SAVRIN:  That would not be our position,
Justice Kagan.  Our position is that it's not
content-based in a constitutional sense for purposes of
applying strict scrutiny, that the distinction is
permissible here without relation to the content or in
terms of favoring or censoring certain viewpoints or
ideas.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, viewpoint
discrimination is quite different from content
discrimination.  And you are trying to reduce our rules
against discriminating on the basis of content to a rule
against viewpoint discrimination.
MR. SAVRIN:  Not just view --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, ideological signs,
that is a content category, and there is as much a First
Amendment right to give somebody directions as there is
to speak about -- about being green or whatever else.
Is there no First Amendment right to give somebody
directions?
MR. SAVRIN:  Justice Scalia, we would say
that the -- they perform different functions.  It
certainly --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They sure do, but is there
a First Amendment right for these other messages or not?
MR. SAVRIN:  I think they would have a right
to speak, and I think that they do have that right to
speak and that intermediate scrutiny applies to
regulations about how speech can be communicated as
opposed to what can be communicated.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you did say in your
brief that the First Amendment does not require
directional signs, so they could be banned altogether.
MR. SAVRIN:  I think if it's narrowly
tailored and meets the intermediate scrutiny test in a
particular jurisdiction, then --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that is a lot of
words.  I'm giving you an example.
The law says no directional signs.  That's
the law.  Does that -- is -- does that offend the First
Amendment?
MR. SAVRIN:  I think that it -- well, when
you say offend the First Amendment, I think you would
have to apply the intermediate scrutiny analysis and our
position would be that it would -- that it could survive
that analysis.
If I could return to Justice Kagan's
question about the interests that are served, it's
different.  A directional sign, there needs to be more
than in order to direct travelers along a route, so that
justifies a -- perhaps a smaller size.  There is no
contention in the record; in fact, the court of appeals
found that they function as intended.  As far as the
duration is concerned, there's no travelers going to an
event that is not presently occurring.  In fact, the
Town of Gilbert expanded the time frame from 2 hours to
12 hours, and I -- our question is whether or not that
is something that implicates First Amendment
jurisprudence as opposed to --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You say on -- suppose we're
talking about the context of signs.  You say, well,
let's look to the purpose of forbidding -- any
prohibition, and I guess it has to do with safety or
beautification.
MR. SAVRIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  First question would be:
Is there some category that you don't allow to put up
signs?  Answer, no.  Everybody can put up signs.
So what about applying strict scrutiny to
that?  If you are going to distinguish on the basis of
what the sign says, you have to have an awfully good
reason, if your decision is you can't put up one at all.
Next, you put them up, but you have all content -- all
kinds of distinctions how, how long, et cetera.
Now, in respect to that, maybe you should
have more leeway, leeway depending upon the purpose of
the sign.  So if, for example, it's about an open air,
municipal movie, you could say put up signs about movies
or something.  I mean, you know, you maybe have more
leeway there.
But still they're saying you would flunk
even that test here because there isn't really a very
good reason at all in this case for making the sign
smaller or for putting it there for such a short time.
Now, how do you react -- there are three
parts:  One, very tough if you are going to say you
can't put it up at all, sometimes called strict
scrutiny; two, somewhat more lenient if it gets up, but
you are trying to distinguish among how and under what
circumstances, how long; and then three, do you even
satisfy that one?  That's called time, place and manner,
the second one.
MR. SAVRIN:  Yes, okay.  Well, with respect
to the first one, the interest most of the times in sign
ordinance regulations as the -- as you've indicated, is
aesthetics and safety.  With respect to aesthetics, I
don't believe that that would meet the definition of a
compelling interest, so that it's -- it's automatically,
presumptively, and conclusively unconstitutional if the
strict scrutiny is applied and that's the -- there is no
compelling interest.
With respect to the interests at stake here,
we again believe that directional signs are functionally
different from an ideological sign or even from a
political sign, that the directional signs do not need
to be larger and also that there are more of them.  And
so if there are more of them, the trade-off is -- at
least the legislature in this town has decided the
trade-off is that they need to be smaller because they
need to guide travelers along a route.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And political signs are
there almost all year, on the rights-of-way.  You talk
about clutter.  What if somebody doesn't like politics,
and he says politics is spinach.  I want ideology.  I
would like ideological signs on the right-of-way.  You
say, I'm sorry, you are wrong, we think politics is more
important, because we are politicians and we're on the
city council.
(Laughter.)
MR. SAVRIN:  I have two responses to that,
Justice Scalia.  The first one is that there is a
statute in Arizona that this ordinance complies with in
terms of the placement, the duration, and the size of
the political signs.  The town doesn't have any leeway
in that because it needs to comply with the statute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does this State statute
have the same size and duration?  The State statute says
that you have to allow political signs, but does it
specify the size and the duration?
MR. SAVRIN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it does.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you're saying that the
town ordinance just mirrors the State?
MR. SAVRIN:  Yes.  Yes, it does.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And do you have that
State law?
MR. SAVRIN:  I do.  It's section 16-1019.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So your defense to a First
Amendment complaint is, what, the State made me do it?
MR. SAVRIN:  Well, our defense -- well, in
part, yes, because we need to comply with the statute,
and it doesn't make sense that, as a result, all signs
need to be -- meet those provisions for purposes of
preserving beauty, reducing clutter, so on and so forth.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It makes a lot of sense if
you believe in the First Amendment.
MR. SAVRIN:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you believe that neither
the State nor the city is entitled to say politics is
really important, as opposed to music.
MR. SAVRIN:  The other consideration here,
Justice Scalia, is that we're talking about public
property.  And one of the issues that has not been
developed, certainly in the record in this -- at this
Court, is the extent to which the government can select
subject matter for what is a non-traditional public
forum.  So there are issues as well that would need to
be developed a little bit further before any application
of intermediate scrutiny, we say, could be continued --
if they -- if the -- if their -- if this Court were to
find problems with the Ninth Circuit's application of
intermediate scrutiny, and I think that there would
still be some issues on location that would need to be
developed on the public forum, and that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You say the street is not
a -- not a traditional public forum?
MR. SAVRIN:  That is the -- certainly
Gilbert's position.  It was something that was argued in
the Ninth Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit did not resolve
that issue.  But I believe that would be a question of
Arizona law.
But, again, we have not developed that and
that issue has not been developed in this -- at this --
in this Court, and I think the reason is because the
issue in this Court is whether or not strict scrutiny
applies.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how do you justify
the -- the differing treatments of Petitioner's sign, on
the one hand, and the weekend builder event signs and
homeowners' association signs?  Homeowners' association
signs can be 80 square feet, and the Petitioner's sign
can be 6 square feet.
MR. SAVRIN:  The homeowners' signs are not
really directional signs, because they can only be
within the residential community.  They are not
directing travelers off site, in a generic sense, to a
location.  There is also a permit requirement.
And the other thing is -- about the 80
square feet is, that is total sign area.  That's not one
sign.  That's the total sign area you can have.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Has anyone ever been
denied one of those permits?
MR. SAVRIN:  I don't know the answer to that
question, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose the Petitioners want
to put up a sign that says, we're having a church
service at 10:00 o'clock on Sunday morning.  Under your
code, when can they put that up and when do they have to
take it down?
MR. SAVRIN:  They could put it up 12 hours
before, so that would be 10:00 o'clock p.m., and they
could take it -- and they have to take down, I believe
it's an hour afterwards.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So they can put it up after
dark on Saturday and then they have to take it down
within an hour after, when, the commencement of the
service, or --
MR. SAVRIN:  The end of the event.
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- the end of this --
MR. SAVRIN:  The end of the event.  If
the --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that really
gives them an opportunity to invite people to come to
their service?
MR. SAVRIN:  The purpose of these signs is
not supposed to be invitational; it's supposed to be
directional.  If the event was occurring at 10:00
o'clock at night or at 6:00 o'clock in the evening, it
could be up during the day.  If the event occurs all
weekend long, it could be up all weekend long.  It's --
it's tied to the event.
So in that sense, it -- it absolutely serves
its purpose for having on -- on the 12 hours before,
because if they want to invite members of the public to
the services, they can and do have many other
opportunities and alternatives -- including signage,
including the ideological sign -- that they can use.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So they could put up a,
quote/unquote, ideological sign that says, "Come to our
service on Sunday morning," but no arrow, and then they
put up another sign that says, this is the arrow?  Or
maybe they put up on the first sign, "Come to our
service on Sunday morning; we can't tell you now where
it will be because the town won't let us, but if you
come -- if you drive by here tomorrow morning at a
certain time, you will see an arrow."
(Laughter.)
MR. SAVRIN:  The sign could say, Your Honor,
where it is taking place, but if it is intending to
guide travelers to that location, then it would need to
comply with -- with the provisions.  And the reason,
again --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is the -- what is
the guidance?  I'm looking at the Good News signs on
page 3 of the little brief.  It just has an arrow.  It
says the name of the elementary school, and then it
has -- it looks like a telephone number and an arrow.
The arrow is the  direction?
MR. SAVRIN:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is not, as you
described earlier, turn left on Main Street, turn right
on Front Street.
MR. SAVRIN:  It is the same function as
that.  But we would say the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What is this about, this
argument?  I mean, you agree they can put up a big sign.
Can they put up a big sign, ideological, saying, "Come
to the church  service next Tuesday, 4th and H Streets,
three blocks right and two blocks left"?  All right?  Or
are you saying they can't say, "three blocks right and
two blocks left"? And that's what this argument is about?
MR. SAVRIN:  That is what it comes down to.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, my goodness.  I
mean -- I mean, on that, it does sound as if the town is
being a little unreasonable, doesn't it?
MR. SAVRIN:  Well, we would say that it
has -- that the sign has an -- what this Court has
termed an incidental effect on the expression of the
Petitioners, that certainly they can have the
ideological sign, the information that they want to
include --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose we said this:  That
where, in fact, the argument is of this nature, where,
in fact, there are -- you can have a big sign and have
everything on it except an arrow, and the purpose of the
sign is, in fact, to tell people both what is happening
and where.  That there is no good, under any test,
reason for requiring this little dingy thing?  End of
the case.  Let's go with that.
MR. SAVRIN:  Well, Your Honor -- our
response to that, Your Honor, is that the directional
signs, in order to work, need to guide travelers along
the route.  So there's going to be a whole lot of these
signs in order for them to function as intended.  It can
be a mile away, it can be two miles away.
So having just one sign, perhaps, under
the Court's hypothetical, it seems rather silly, but if
you are thinking about having a whole bunch of these
signs over a long distance, then I think then that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does Good News -- does
the Good News church have a number of signs -- just as
illustration, how many signs do they have?
MR. SAVRIN:  I believe the number is 15, but
I'm not 100 percent sure about that, Your Honor.  I know
that they have quite a few.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you see that car
when you -- can you see that sign at all when you
pass --
MR. SAVRIN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you see that sign at
all when you pass in a moving car?
MR. SAVRIN:  Yes.  In fact, the court of
appeals has found that it functioned as intended and
there is no indication that -- that it did not.  So
there's -- it seems to me that those are the kind of
decisions, as far as size, duration, are ones that
should be the fodder  of legislative deliberation.  And
as long as it meets the intermediate scrutiny test, it
should pass Constitutional muster.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whatever that is.  Whatever
that is, right?
MR. SAVRIN:  Well, the intermediate scrutiny
test, I think, is if it's narrowly tailored, and also if
there are alternative modes of communication.  But I
think that applying strict scrutiny to these types of
regulations will result in sign ordinances being struck
down uniformly, just about, and the only speech that --
that will be allowed will be speech that is
constitutionally required.  Everything else will not be.
But I think the problem, if there is one,
that Gilbert has gotten into is that it allows a lot of
speech that a lot of other ordinances might not in a lot
of different formats.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just, again, if I could
understand --
MR. SAVRIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- let's even assume that
intermediate scrutiny applies, and just focus in on this
special provision for ideological speech which allows
very large signs to stay up as long as possible.  And
you would say we're making that exception, if you will,
to the general rule that there shouldn't be clutter and
there shouldn't be a lot of these signs because, why?
MR. SAVRIN:  Because directional signs --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, no, no.
MR. SAVRIN:  I'm sorry.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I just asked you for the
exemption for ideological signs, for the specially
generous provision for ideological signs.  Why do
ideological signs get such generous treatment?
MR. SAVRIN:  Because the -- to protect the
First Amendment right to speak.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So that is a
content-based rationale.  And then, you know, on one theory,
you lose regardless of what the standard of review is.
MR. SAVRIN:  If the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You are not justifying it on
the grounds of safety or on the grounds of clutter.
You're saying, this is a special kind of speech that we
think there ought to be more of.
MR. SAVRIN:  With respect to the ideological
sign?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.
MR. SAVRIN:  Yeah, the purpose of that is --
is it is content-neutral in terms of anything can be on
that sign.  And what we're saying --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that goes back to what
Justice Scalia said.  It's viewpoint neutral, but, you
know, it's content-based.  And maybe you are just saying
that we've run amok on this content-based distinction,
and there would be an argument there.  But, I mean, it
is content-based to say what is ideology and what is
not.
MR. SAVRIN:  And I would agree that that's
what we're arguing, Your Honor, that what we're saying
is that the First Amendment is -- guards against the
abridgment of speech.  And having a rigid content
definition to be the on/off switch for whether strict
scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny applies does -- is not
workable, does not achieve common-sense results.  It
handicaps the legislatures in their ability to be
flexible.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, maybe you think that,
but the guy who doesn't like politics and likes ideology
doesn't think that.
MR. SAVRIN:  Well, the person --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So we're -- we're supposed
to sit here and say, oh, political speech is the most
valuable and then you can allow that, but ideological speech
comes in a close second, and then what?  Then
directional speech or whatever else?
MR. SAVRIN:  Well, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't want to do that.  I
don't think you should want any governmental official,
even -- even a judge, to do stuff like that.
MR. SAVRIN:  Your Honor, I think for
purposes of ruling in this case, I think the question is
whether or not the temporary directional sign is subject
to -- is content-based in a constitutional sense such
that it would be subject to strict scrutiny.  We believe
that that would be improper.  We think that it would be
against the jurisprudence of this Court.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is content-based in a
constitutional sense, as opposed to content-based in a
non-constitutional sense?
MR. SAVRIN:  Whether it puts the finger on a
scale of ideas or viewpoints, whether the substance of
it -- whether --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That is viewpoint-based,
not content-based.
MR. SAVRIN:  Well, whether it favors
or censors --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You want to eliminate
content-based as the criterion and make it
viewpoint-based.
MR. SAVRIN:  No, Your Honor, that is not
what we're advocating.  What we're advocating is that if
an ordinance does not -- if an ordinance addresses the
function of the sign as opposed to the particular ideas
or even the subject matter, then it would not be
content-based for purposes of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there -- is there a
difference between the function of the sign and the
content of the sign?
MR. SAVRIN:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I frankly can't grasp that.
What is it?
MR. SAVRIN:  Well, it depends on how --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Doesn't its function depend
upon its content?
MR. SAVRIN:  In a literal sense, yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I see.  What sense are
we talking here?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Poetic?
MR. SAVRIN:  Well, both --
MR. SAVRIN:  No.  We think that there needs
a be a -- a nuance, as the Federal government has
indicated.  So it guides the -- the content test is a
guide for courts to determine which level of scrutiny
applies.  And at some level, if content is the on/off
switch, then such distinctions as temporary and
permanent, commercial and non-commercial, even on-site
and off-site, are going to be content.  And we don't
believe that that in and of itself justifies strict
scrutiny.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. CORTMAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. CORTMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Just a few quick points in response, if I may.
Clarification point on the State statute.
First of all, when this case began, the State statute
was not in effect, and political signs were actually
allowed up for longer than the period of time.  When the
State statute was enacted, it actually lessened that
time.  So it's not the State's doing that the town
decided to allow political signs in its -- in its
right-of-way.
But even with the State statute, the -- if
the State has decided that its interest in free speech
in political signs outweighs the interest in safety and
aesthetics, then the town should basically adopt an
ordinance that abides by that.  And the simple way to do
that is to treat it as a constitutional floor.  If the
State has decided that we're going to allow political
signs up for that period of time -- and by the way, the
statue doesn't mention other signs.  So it's not a
restriction like this town code is.  All it says is,
we've deemed it important enough for political signs to
be up for --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's just permissive for
political signs.
MR. CORTMAN:  That's right.  And so the
response by the town is, okay, if that's the case and
the State has decided that political signs outweigh our
interests in safety and aesthetics, the way we deal with
that is treating other similar signs the same.
I think, a couple other points, the noise
ordinance is a perfect example, whether it's the that
side case or the Kobachs case.  This ordinance would be
akin to allowing, for example, political speech to be
much louder in decibels and for longer periods of time,
and someone on the street corner inviting someone to
church must be quieter and for lesser periods of time.
And quickly, if I may address the safety and
beautification interests, they are certainly important
interests.  But as this Court said several times in
Carey v. Brown, for example, and Discovery Network, the
distinctions, the content-based distinctions in the code
bear no relationship to the government interest.  The
distinctions don't advance those interests.
And as to being under-inclusive, I think
it's similar to what this Court found in Discovery
Network.  When there the town wanted to prohibit 62 news
racks and then allow 1,500 to 2,000 news racks to
remain, this Court said that was under-inclusive and
would fail just on that.  Here, the town is allowing an
unlimited number of political signs, but then
prohibiting just a few other signs.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
