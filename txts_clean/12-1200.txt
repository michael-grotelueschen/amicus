CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

Benefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison, the Chapter 7
Trustee of the Estate of Bellingham Insurance Agency.
Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Mr. Chief Justice
and may it please the Court:
The judgment enforced against EBIA in this
case was entered by a non-Article III bankruptcy court
pursuant to a statute that this Court has declared
unconstitutional as violating the separation of powers.
The entry of a judgment of the United States
is not nearly a matter of private interest to the
litigants.  Rather, it carries the force of law that is
binding on other courts, binding on the executive branch
which must enforce the judgment, and even binding on the
legislature which cannot reopen the judgment.
The entry of final judgment of the United
States is the ultimate exercise of the judicial power
under Article III, just as the enactment of legislation
is the ultimate exercise of the legislative power under
Article I.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why should that matter
given that, after the bankruptcy judge ruled, the U.S.
District Court gave de novo review to this case and
entered a final judgment that met all the requirements
of Article III?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  The judgment that
was entered by the district court was not an exercise of
original jurisdiction but rather appellate jurisdiction.
In fact, Section 1334 is clear that it confers the
district court original jurisdiction, but once a
judgment has been entered by the bankruptcy court, the
review by the district court is an exercise of appellate
jurisdiction under Section 158.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Here's something -- I'm
sorry.  Here's something that happens every day.  A
district judge refers to a magistrate judge a motion for
summary judgment.  The magistrate judge issues a report
and recommendation.  The district judge reviews it de
novo and may agree or disagree.  If it agrees, the
district court will enter summary judgment.
I don't see a difference other than a purely
semantic difference between that situation and what
happened here.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Your Honor, the
entry of judgment is the act of the judicial branch that
carries the force of law.  The issuance of a report and
recommendation by a magistrate does not.  It's only
after the exercise of judgment and the entry of judgment
that it has binding effect.  Binding on the other branches --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you talking about a
mere formality?  Are you arguing that because it was the
bankruptcy judge and not the district court judge who
signed the final judgment, that that makes a difference?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  It -- yes, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the essence of
your argument.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Yes, Your Honor.
Because the active entry of judgment --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if we vacated and
remanded, and the district court looked at this, because
it's already seen it, and basically just signed below
the line that the bankruptcy judge signed, you would be
okay?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Yes, Your Honor.
But the act of entering judgment is, both as a legal
matter and as a practical matter, different from the
appellate -- exercise of appellate jurisdiction.  The
act of entering judgment, the district court must -- if
it is the one entering the judgment, has to determine
that judgment is properly entered.  It's a proper
exercise of the appellate -- of the Article III power.
The district court would have the
discretion under Ninth Circuit law consistent with
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby to carry a motion for summary
judgment to allow the record to develop further.  That
option, available to the district court when it's
sitting as a matter of original jurisdiction, is not
available to the district court sitting on appeal.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It reviewed this case de
novo.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's true.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And it decided that
there were no issues, no factual issues in dispute and
that the law clearly applied the way it did.  I don't
understand why that option was taken away from it on
appellate review.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  On appellate
review, it had two options:  Affirm or reverse.  As an
original matter, though, it would have had a third
option, which would have been to deny the motion at that
time to let the record develop more fully.
But more fundamentally --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why would the -- why
would the district judge do that when the district court
said that there are no disputed issues, no relevant
disputed issues of fact and it's a pure legal question?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, Your Honor, I
truly believe that on this record, where there clearly
were disputes between the two affidavits, that an
Article III judge would not have entered summary
judgment as an original matter.  Sitting as an appellate
court where its decision was going to be subject to
appellate review immediately, perhaps its analysis was
different.
But I think more fundamentally, the absence
of a judgment entered by a court with authority to do so
means that the appellate court also lacks appellate
jurisdiction, and this Court has so recognized in
Ayrshire Collieries, in the Glidden case --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Will it be conceded, so
far as you know, by your friends on the other side that
this was appellate?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, I don't
know --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is it that makes it
appellate?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well,
Section 158(a) speaks in language of the district court
exercising appellate jurisdiction.  It uses the word
"jurisdiction."  So once the -- in 157(b), a core matter
such as this, the bankruptcy court is delegated
authority to hear and determine and enter final judgment
subject to review pursuant to Section 158.
Section 158(a) specifies that the district
court is exercising appellate jurisdiction in that
event.  So the district court --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It uses the word
"appellate" --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  It uses --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- in 158?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Yes, 158(a) says --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is where?  Where are
you reading?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  I'm using the
government's amicus brief, the statutory appendix that's
on page 4a.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know why it wasn't
in your brief.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  It is in our brief.
The reason I cite to the government's brief is it also
has 1334.  It's slightly more comprehensive.
So on page 4a of the government's statutory
appendix, Section 158(a), "The district courts of the
United States shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals."
This Court has, in numerous decisions,
attributed significance to Congress's use of the word
"jurisdiction," that Congress knows what the word means
and when it uses that word, it means it is
jurisdictional.
The -- Section 1334, on the other hand,
which is on page 14a of the government's statutory
appendix, 1334(b) says that "The district courts shall
have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all
civil proceedings arising under Title 11."
So the district court does have original
jurisdiction at the outset, but when it has referred the
matter to the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy court
has entered final judgment, then pursuant to 157(b) and
pursuant to 158(a), the district court is now exercising
appellate jurisdiction.
JUSTICE BREYER:  There is a -- I
want you to get on a bit, because I'd say the question
that we're, at least for me, is one of congressional
intent, not in necessarily your case but in future
cases.  And the argument that is that the statute can be
read, it silences, to say if Congress wanted to allow
people in noncore cases to submit reports and
recommendations, they surely would have wanted it in
what they thought was a core case that turned out to be
noncore.
So I want your response to that, and I would
couple that with my own research for an opinion when I
was one the First Circuit about the fraudulent
conveyances, and they are about bankruptcy.
I grant you that there is a Statute of
Elizabeth, it's a legal matter for several hundred
years, but the person who is defrauded, the people
defrauded are the creditors.  And in most instances, the
fraud consists of transferring property to a friend,
rather than a creditor, where you know you are
insolvent.
Now, that is a legal matter.  But it is
about bankruptcy.  And it's State law, but it is about
bankruptcy.  And it is, according to you -- I may not
agree with that, but I think we have to take it as
noncore.  But why wouldn't Congress have, of course,
wanted reports and recommendations if they couldn't get
what they really wanted, which is to have the bankruptcy
judge decide it?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  To be clear,
Congress designated fraudulent conveyance actions as
core.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I know that, and I would
have said they were right.  But, nonetheless, I am faced
with case law that says to the contrary.  Okay.  So my
question is, if they couldn't get -- if they couldn't
get what they wanted, which is to have the bankruptcy
judge decide it, why wouldn't they at least have wanted
the bankruptcy judge to write a report and
recommendations and send it on to the district judge so
he can review it de novo?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, I think that
what's constraining the court is the language that
Congress enacted.  Congress --
JUSTICE BREYER:  If I find an ambiguity in
that language, then you would say I would be sensible to
read it contrary to what you want.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  I -- I don't
believe there is an ambiguity, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, okay.  That's -- I
got that point.  One is you say, It's totally
unambiguous, you can't do anything about it.  But if, in
my opinion, it is -- take it as a hypothetical -- it's
ambiguous enough to get what Congress wanted.  Now, can
you give me any argument against what I just said?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is the ambiguity we
are talking about?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, the
ambiguity -- I actually think there is no ambiguity
because --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is the non-ambiguity
we are talking about?
(Laughter.)
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Congress --
Congress very clearly distinguished a dichotomy between
those cases in which the bankruptcy courts were to issue
proposed findings and rec- -- conclusions and those that
it was to hear and determine.
The cases that bankruptcy courts were to
hear and determine were cases in which the bankruptcy
courts were to enter final judgment subject only to
appellate review --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I've got it.  I'd like an
answer to my question.  My question is I want you to
assume that the language is at least somewhat ambiguous.
And on that assumption, is there any reason not to adopt
the government's position.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  There are -- there
are several, Your Honor.  And part of the problem is
that the question of how to construe that language in
157(b) does not only affect how Stern claims are going
to be handled, but also, all other claims under 157(b).
Congress very clearly wanted an efficient system in
which bankruptcy judges would enter judgment and there
would be only appellate review by the district courts.
If the Court reads 157(b)'s "hear and
determine" language to also encompass the authority to
issue non-final reports and recommendations, that would
not be limited to the class of cases covered by Stern
that are core, but not --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why would we have to
do that, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier?  Why couldn't we say
that this presents a distinct problem, these Stern-type
claims, and it's really a problem of severability, and
that we should understand this statute in light of Stern
as essentially creating this middle category which
Congress clearly meant to have the treatment that the
noncore claims get.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  It's --
unfortunately, the statutory language does not admit
of severance of the kind that Respondents suggest.  And
that's because fraudulent conveyance actions are core,
not simply because they're listed in 157(b)(2)(H), but
because they are proceedings that arise under Title 11.
That's the definition of core proceedings.  And so even
if the Court were to line out --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the definition -- the
definition was linked to a purpose.  You-- you laid out
very nicely the two categories; the one category where
the bankruptcy judge enters a judgment, the other
category where the bankruptcy judge makes
recommendations.  So, if you -- the purpose of the
classification was to indicate the bankruptcy judge can
make the final judgment, can only make recommendations.
Suppose the district judge had said, I'm
uncertain after Stern about whether the bankruptcy judge
had authority to enter a final judgment.  So I am going
to treat that summary judgment as a recommendation.
I'll treat it as a recommendation and I will review it
de novo.  I agree, I enter final judgment.
If the district judge had said that, then
you would have no case, right?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  I -- I don't think
that 157(b) envisions that the district court could do
that.  The district court's review under -- of a
judgment entered under 157(b) is, on appeal, pursuant to
158, which is an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, not
original jurisdiction.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If -- if -- if we believe
that the word "determine" means make a final judgment,
which you assert it means, so that there's no ambiguity,
it seems to me you have a statute in which the
bankruptcy judge is only authorized to make
recommendations in some situations and to make final
judgments in others.  And surely, there's a problem with
a district judge altering that disposition --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That -- that's
right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- by just saying, oh, I
know you're supposed to make a final determination, but
just for fun, give me your recommendation.  I mean,
that is just contrary to the statute.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's clearly not
what Congress provided.  It had different --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Congress might have --
might have provided that if it had known about Stern,
right?
(Laughter.)
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's -- that's
true.  And --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But do we sit here to write
the statutes that Congress would have written --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- if they knew about some
future events?  I don't think so.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  And -- and, in
fact, there are a number of --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, we do try though,
again, to apply severability principles to write the
statute that Congress would have written if it had known
about a constitutional ruling.  And that's essentially
what Justice Breyer is suggesting.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  I think, Your
Honor, there are two problems with that.  First is that
by changing the definition of "core proceedings," there
are other collateral consequences for other provisions
of the code.  Under Section 1 -- 1334(c), for example,
there is an abstention in certain noncore proceedings.
And so Congress has defined the scope of the abstention
according to the same language that it uses in 157(b)
whether a proceeding arises under Title 11 or does not
do so, but is merely in relation to a case under Title
11.
So if the Court goes and revises what
Congress has provided as the definition of core in
157(b), there will be collateral consequences for other
statutes that Congress had enacted.
But the second point is that there are, as I
think Justice Scalia was suggesting, policy decisions
that really only Congress can make in deciding how to
respond to Stern, because one can compare, for example,
the provisions of 157(c)(1), which is the bankruptcy
judge issuing a proposed findings and conclusions, and
the Magistrates Act, 636.  The two are actually quite
different.
The magistrates, for example, are assigned a
specific motion to consider and issue a report and
recommendation on.  By contrast, the bankruptcy court in
(c)(1) exercises jurisdiction over the entire
proceeding, including up to conducting a trial in
something that isn't subject to jury trial, and then
issuing a report and recommendation to the district
court.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But none of that is involved
in this case.  We have this case in front of us.  We
don't have every other possible case that could
implicate this issue.  We have one case and it involves
summary judgment.
And so there isn't -- there are no findings
of fact, and there is no substantive difference between
a district court's reviewing a report and recommendation
on summary judgment and what happened here.  I -- I have
heard nothing other than formalities.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  But the formalities
matter.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why do they matter for
Article III?  Maybe they matter for statutory reasons.
Why do they matter for Article III?  What your client
got was exactly -- substantively exactly what your
client would have gotten had this been referred to a
magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, I -- to
begin, I think the formalities do matter and not only do
I think so.  This Court has repeatedly said that the
absence of a judgment entered with authority means the
absence of appellate jurisdiction as well.  And all the
appellate court can do is to vacate and remand.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, is Article III not
violated so long as the parties are happy?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can the parties agree to
have a -- an Article III court decide a case it has no
jurisdiction to decide, and so long as no harm is done
to the parties, it's okay?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Quite -- quite the
contrary, Your Honor.  The Court has repeatedly stressed
that the parties may not, by their agreement, confer
jurisdiction that would not otherwise exist.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought there were two
aspects to the Article III problem.  One affects the
individuals and it's an unfairness, and the other is
structural, as Justice Scalia has said.  But both are at
issue.  And so where you have only a structural issue
and it's a question of getting the bankruptcy courts to
work and nobody's hurt by it, doesn't that at least cut
in favor of interpreting a statute to prevent chaos --
not chaos, that's too strong -- but to prevent -- to
allow the function of the court to work better?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  To the contrary,
Your Honor, in Schor, the Court made clear that where
the structural features of the Constitution are at
issue, that is precisely where parties cannot be
depended upon to assert the interest, and it cannot be
joined by consent.  And here we have an example.
The constitutional violation identified by
the Court in Stern existed for 25 years before the issue
finally made it to this Court.  In part because parties
were reluctant to assert that issue before a bankruptcy
court in which its fate held.
The -- the issues here, the other side says
there is no structural problem because there's no
aggrandizement or encroachment.  But to the contrary,
Congress has reserved to itself power over bankruptcy
judges that the Constitution denies it over Article III
judges.
The President's power to appoint has been
encroached upon.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, couldn't you say the
same thing once again about magistrates, the exact same
arguments would apply to them?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  I think in large
part they do.  Although there is a distinction, perhaps
an important distinction, that in the Magistrates Act,
the consent requirement is built into the statute.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I don't see why that
would make a difference if you say the problem is
congressional aggrandizement or congressional
encroachment of a certain kind.  It doesn't seem to me
to make any difference in that case, if Congress says,
by the way, you can consent to it.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  You're absolutely
right, Your Honor.  And I think that the problem that
this Court identified in Stern and that we identify here
applies equally to the magistrates.  But we have
explained that that argument, even if not accepted in
full, would distinguish our case from the Magistrates
Act, because here, the Act enacted by Congress was
unconstitutional.  It assigned, irregardless of consent,
this action to determination and final judgment by a
bankruptcy judge.  The Court considered this statute and
held it unconstitutional in Stern.
So if consent were to cure the problem here,
then the jurisdiction of the Court would depend solely
on the consent of the parties.  If, on the other hand,
the Court was considering in the first instance whether
consent as a limiting feature on the jurisdiction of the
non-Article III body meant that there was not the types
of structural problems that the Court identified in
Stern, then it would be as part of the determination
whether there was or was not an Article III violation in
the first instance.
JUSTICE ALITO:  May I ask you to clarify
what you're saying about the constitutionality of the
Magistrates Act?  Are you saying that it is
unconstitutional insofar as it allows magistrate judges
to try matters by consent, or are you saying further
that it is unconstitutional insofar as it allows a
district judge to refer a dispositive matter to a
magistrate judge for a report and recommendation subject
to de novo review, or both?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Only -- only the
former, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  The former is not implicated
in this case.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That -- that's
right.  I was answer -- just answering the question --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I see.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  -- about the logic
of the argument and how far it went.
And -- and, I guess, again, what we suggest
is that there might be a distinction when the Court is
considering a statute.  And as Schor lays out the many
factors that the Court might consider, the fact that
consent is a limiting feature on the non-Article III
body's jurisdiction might lead the Court to conclude
there was no Article III violation.
But here, where there was no consent in this
statute, the Court has already held in Stern that there
was an Article III violation.  The statute does not
constitutionally confer jurisdiction on the bankruptcy
courts.  So if there is jurisdiction here, it would be
purely a matter of private party consent.  And that's
precisely what the Court has held is not permissible as
a matter of jurisdiction.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So are you saying,
contrary to our case law, that you can never have
implied consent?  We have held differently in other
cases.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  I'm not arguing
that there cannot be implied consent, but in Roell,
as -- as a construction of the Magistrates Act, the
Court held that consent must be knowing and voluntary.
There, of course, the litigant had notice because the
statute had advised the litigant that it had the right
to refuse consent.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're confusing me.  I
thought you -- you did say that there can't be implied
consent or even express consent to what happened here.
Isn't that your position?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  I'm -- I'm sorry.
I was -- I was -- I thought I was answering a different
question.  In our view, consent cannot be the basis for
the exercise of jurisdiction by a non-Article III court.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Express or implied.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Express or implied.
That's right, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought that's what --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  So this is the
subsidiary argument, our, really, fallback argument,
which is to say, even if consent could play a role, it
would only be where that was part of the statute, and
thus, part of the Court's analysis of whether this
statute was constitutional.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm a little confused.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  I'm sorry, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's just save your
time.  I'll ask on rebuttal.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  So there -- there
were two cases that the other side had cited, Roell and
McDonald, for that point.  But in each case, the statute
itself featured consent as a limiting feature on the
non-Article III court's authority.
If there are no further questions, I'll
reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Pottow.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN POTTOW
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. POTTOW:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Justice Alito is entirely correct, for the
reason we can win the most straightforward way is
because he got everything he wanted in the courts below.
And I would like to also address Justice Ginsburg's
question about what could have happened in the
hypothetical situation.
But if I may begin, please, I'd like to
address Justice Scalia's point about where's the
ambiguity in the statute.  And unfortunately, my friend
and I disagree, because I think the statute under
157(b)(1) is unambiguous in my favor.
So if I could take you back to the statute,
and I'll use the Solicitor General's brief for
convenience.  157(b)(1) is the provision by which
district courts, if they want to -- there's no
compulsion on these Article III officers -- if they want
to, they can refer matters to bankruptcy judges.  And it
says, when there is a matter referred, that they may
hear and determine the matter and may enter an order or
judgment.
My interpretation, I believe, is the more
natural one of "may enter an order and judgment," it's a
permissive grant of authority.  There's no compulsion to
enter an order and judgment.  They can simply hear and
determine the matter and not enter an order and
judgment.  And I can contrast this textual language --
you don't have to go very far -- down in (c)(1) and
(c)(2), where (c)(2), there was only one "may," they
don't have the double "may permissive grant of
authority."  And there's -- and in the noncore matters,
there's a -- a "it shall," when "it shall determine."
They use the verb "shall" in (c)(2).  So I think that
(b)(1) with two uses of "may" is very clear that when a
matter is referred under (b)(1), they may enter an order
of judgment, but don't have to enter an order of
judgment.  And I think that gets us around his
difficulty --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does that bear on the
question whether this is appellate?  Do you agree that
this is appellate, once the district judge -- district
court has the matter in front of it?
MR. POTTOW:  So if there is a judgment, I
would concede that we then have an appeal that occurs,
Justice Kennedy.
But what is critically important why I think
that doesn't create a problem --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If there is a judgment in
the bankruptcy court, you would concede there is an
appeal to the district court?
MR. POTTOW:  If there is a district -- for
example, in a noncore proceedings --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.
MR. POTTOW:  I'm sorry.  In a core
proceeding where there would be a judgment in the
bankruptcy court, I would concede that that would be an
appellate matter before the district court, if there was
a full judgment.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you -- you read me --
want me to read that -- that when a district judge
refers the matter to a bankruptcy judge to hear and
determine and to enter an appropriate order, the
bankruptcy judge can say, you know, I'm just too busy.
MR. POTTOW:  No.  No.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm on Easter vacation and
I may hear and determine it, and I may enter appropriate
orders, but I don't feel like it.
MR. POTTOW:  No.  The "may -- the "may"
prerogative, Justice Scalia, is with the district court.
The district court may refer to it and it may refer to a
final judgment or may not.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't say that it may
refer.  It says, "bankruptcy judges may hear and
determine."
MR. POTTOW:  At the instruction of the
district judge.  I don't believe the bankruptcy judge
has the authority to feel lazy or disinclined.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do you bring the "may"
over to the district court?
MR. POTTOW:  In the order of reference, so
we have to go back to 157(a), which is what -- what
starts with the whole reference of cases from district
courts.  Recall that a bankruptcy court is a unit of the
district court.  So as an institutional matter, it's the
district court that exercises jurisdiction.
Under 1334, the Federal subject matter
jurisdiction of bankruptcy is vested in the district
court.  Now, as a matter of which officer --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then then the "may" that you're
concerned with is the "may" in (a), not the "may" in
(b).
MR. POTTOW:  I -- I use both of those "mays"
if I may, Justice Scalia.  And -- and I think that
the -- that the revision post Stern of many district
courts that government puts forward in appendix of how
these courts have changed their orders of references
have explicitly used this power.  And they say for
matters in which we refer a statutorily core proceeding,
we would -- but there is a Stern claim that arises.  So
when we refer a claim and you think that Article III
presents a problem, we do not want you to enter a final
judgment.  On those referred proceedings, we only want
you to enter a report and recommendation.
So the district courts below are working
this out by changing their orders of references and not
having them enter judgment.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And what the other side
says is that's very nice, but that's not what the
statute says.  The statute does not give the bankruptcy
court the authority to enter a -- a simply
recommendation for what has been defined as a core
proceeding.
For core proceedings, what the statute says
is you'll -- is you'll determine it.  And you're saying,
well, it says that, but since it's been held
unconstitutional, we're going to shift this over to
the -- to the category in which they -- they can issue
an order and recommendation.  Where does that come from?
MR. POTTOW:  I think it has to come from a
textual disagreement with my friend.  He says the phrase
"may hear and determine" should be read to mean must
determine and enter a final judgment.  And I think the
textual phrase "may hear and determine" and "may enter
an order or judgment," suggests that they, if referred
to by the district court, may enter a judgment.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, that's not my problem.
My problem is -- is not why they don't have to enter an
order and judgment.  My problem is why they are
authorized to issue a recommendation.
MR. POTTOW:  Oh, because I don't think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where does that come from?
They're not issued -- they're not authorized to issue
recommendations for core proceedings.
MR. POTTOW:  I see.  I don't believe,
Justice Scalia, that the issuance of a report is a
matter of such significance that there would need to be
an explicit reference to what issue in a report.  A
judgment, if you contrast Section 157 --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, really?  I mean, can a
district judge sort of -- you know, it's not terribly
important because it's just a recommendation.  So I'm
going to refer it to my former partner, you know, my
former law partner.
MR. POTTOW:  But with the consent of the
parties?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, even with the consent
of the parties.
MR. POTTOW:  That would be a special master
situation, I think, Justice Scalia.  If they -- if they
referred, and the district -- yes, the district court
would have inherent authority to refer an issue to a
special master.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  To a special master.
MR. POTTOW:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it has statutory
authority to do that.  There is no statutory authority
here to refer a matter to a bankruptcy judge for nothing
other than a recommendation, except for noncore matters.
MR. POTTOW:  And -- and our position would
be that the issuance of report does not require a
statutory authorization the way the entry of a judgment
requires a statutory authorization.  So the contrasting
treatment under 157(c) of noncore matters is very --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You're saying basically, I
think, the words are, for core proceedings, it
gives the power to the bankruptcy judge to hear and
determine.
MR. POTTOW:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And if I tell the assistant
chef, you deal with orders for bacon and eggs, that
might mean that the assistant chef can deal with eggs
orders alone, or it might mean only those that order
both.
MR. POTTOW:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's why I thought
perhaps it's ambiguous.
MR. POTTOW:  Yes.  And -- and if there's --
further, Justice Breyer, if there's a successive "may"
afterwards, after the bacon and eggs, "and may prepare a
dessert as well," that's even more permissive in --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it can do that for core
-- for those core proceedings that were not held
unconstitutional under Stern, right?
MR. POTTOW:  Yes.  And that was --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It can just refer them and
say just give me the eggs.
MR. POTTOW:  Yes, that's right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't need the bacon.
MR. POTTOW:  And that was the practice --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't have to determine
it; just give me your recommendation.
MR. POTTOW:  Yes.  And that was a practice
even before Stern.  Some courts did that; they had them
just refer on straight-up core claims to give the
reports and recommendations.  There's a case out of the
Tenth Circuit called --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me the
dichotomy set forth in the statute disappears once you
say "hear and determine" means either "hear and
determine" or "hear or determine."
MR. POTTOW:  But I don't think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The whole dichotomy of the
statute disappears.
MR. POTTOW:  Justice Scalia, I don't think
-- I don't think it's a dichotomy.  I think that -- what
they're worried -- I believe what the Congress is
worried about is by putting express constraints on the
entry of a judgment, for precisely the reasons Mr.
Hallward-Driemeier says that judgments are a matter of
some, at least formalistic significance, that they put a
constraint on what you can do regarding entry of a
judgment.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Can I go to
that for a second?
MR. POTTOW:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because let's deal with
statutory language, okay?  I get the core of your
argument to be as follows; pardon the puns.
That for statutorily core proceedings that
constitutionally are not core --
MR. POTTOW:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- we should treat them
as noncore proceedings.  Am I at your point?
MR. POTTOW:  Yes.  But I -- I want to be
clear.  I'm not shoehorning them into the category of
noncore.  I'm saying we should accord them the same
treatment that is accorded to noncore proceedings.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if we're going to
accord them the same treatment --
MR. POTTOW:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- what do I do with
Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012 --
MR. POTTOW:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- which explicitly
states, quote:  "In noncore proceedings, final orders
and judgments shall not be entered on the bankruptcy
judge's order except with the 'express consent of the
parties.'"  So, now you're telling me we're going to
have a third category.  Makes very little sense to me,
okay?  Which is you need express consent for a
magistrate judge to issue a final judgment in a noncore
proceeding, but you can have express or implied consent
to enter the final judgment in core proceedings.
MR. POTTOW:  I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that makes
very -- I understand treating it like noncore
proceeding, but if we're going to treat it that way,
then I think you have to treat it that way for all
purposes, not pick and choose the ones you want.
MR. POTTOW:  I -- first of all, I'd like to
give you some hope, Justice Sotomayor, which is there is
amendments to Rule 7012 that's percolating up to this
Court for -- for consideration to address this issue.  In
the interim, this is what happened in Roell.  In Roell,
we had a rule of procedure that said there must be
express consent before there is the -- the trial before
a magistrate judge, a civil trial before a magistrate
judge, which we do believe is the exact same system as
the bankruptcy court judge.
And what this Court held was when there's a
violation of that rule, right?  When there's not express
consent, if there is, in fact, true consent based on the
conduct, then consent is what matters and it can trump
the rule.  And that's the square holding of Roell.  So
we would argue that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The language of Roell,
the magistrate judge's language didn't use the word --
the language in Roell, the magistrate judge's language
didn't use the word "express consent."  It just -- the
part -- "the clerk shall give written notice to the
parties of their opportunity to consent to the
exercise."
MR. POTTOW:  No, but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the word "express"
was not in the magistrate judge's act.
MR. POTTOW:  No, no, no, no.  So in the act,
in the statute, there was just a reference to consent,
just like we have here in noncore proceedings reference
to consent.  In the rules --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, here you have to
express consent.
MR. POTTOW:  Yes.  In -- in the rules, there
is a requirement under bankruptcy for express consent,
and under Roell, there was a rule for a --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Got it.
MR. POTTOW:  Okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.  Now I understand.
MR. POTTOW:  May I -- if I may, I'd like to
go back to the question that Justice Kennedy raised and
also back to Justice Alito's and Justice Ginsburg
before.
What makes this unusual if -- even if I do
concede that it's an exercise of appellate jurisdiction,
is unlike all the cases cited when talked about the
limited appellate jurisdiction of something like a
circuit court of appeals.  There's a statutory
constraint.  A circuit court of appeals can't enter
judgment if it wants to to fix a trial court that forgot
to enter judgment.
By contrast, district courts in bankruptcy
can enter judgments; they have both appellate and
original jurisdiction.  They can withdraw the reference
from a bankruptcy court under 157(d) and they can enter
judgment.  So the Petitioner in this case got everything
it wanted.  It had an Article III consideration of its
fraudulent conveyance defense before Chief Judge Pechman
of the Western District of Washington, and they lost.
And on -- on page 45A of the Pet. App, you can see that
Chief Judge Pechman meticulously spells out her standard
of review.  She says -- she spends a whole page on it
saying this is going to be de novo review, and she
writes a 12-page opinion with complete de novo review,
saying this is why you lose on the State claim; this is
why you lose on the Federal claim; this is why you lose
on the alter ego claim.  And she says there is no
genuine issue of material fact that has been submitted
on this record.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You would concede
that your case would be -- you would not have a case if
we were dealing with factual findings?
MR. POTTOW:  Yes, that is -- I believe,
Mr. Chief Justice, this is a unique factual posture,
because other -- you can't have de novo review of a fact
that there'd be a clearly erroneous standard.  But
that's not what we have here today.
And regarding his -- my friend's secondary
argument that even if consent is permissible under the
Constitution, and with respect, I do believe this Court
has held that consent is permissible as a grand
constitutional matter, the trilogy of magistrate cases
of Peretz and Roell and Gonzales make it clear that
consensual voir dire is okay; and in discussing
consensual voir dire, this Court explicitly says because
voir dire is comparable in importance to entry of civil
judgment with the consent, which is what magistrate
judges can do.  So I believe this Court has already
blessed the entry of civil judgment by magistrate judges
upon the consent of the parties as a constitutional
matter for --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I want to go back to your
statement that the district court here has both original
and appellate jurisdiction because it can recall the
reference to the bankruptcy judge.  Can it recall the
reference after the bankruptcy judge has issued his
decision in the case?
MR. POTTOW:  I don't --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Has entered a judgment in
the case?
MR. POTTOW:  I think that would be -- I
don't have any case authority for whether they can do
that or not.  And I share Your Honor's skepticism that
that would be -- that would create a statutory problem.
But the question we have here is whether there's an
article -- even if we concede a statutory violation,
which I don't, by the way; I think that this is -- it's
very clear that there was consent of the parties, that
they went before the bankruptcy judge, and he went in
with wide -- eyes wide open.  So I'm spending all this
time talking about a backup argument, as to if we
assume, arguendo, that the bankruptcy judgment was
illegitimate, we still win.  And that's why I said it's
the most straightforward way to resolve this case.  If
it was illegitimate, we still win because of the de novo
review.
My friend tries to disparage Chief Judge
Pechman's and say well, it really wasn't de novo because
even though she spent a page saying I'm doing a de novo
review, I found the word "substantial" and "evidence"
juxtaposed on page 50A of the Pet. App.  And I don't
think that's a fair reading of her opinion.  I think if
you read her analysis, it's quite de novo; she goes
through all the evidence that's submitted and says no
genuine issue of material fact; judgment as a matter of
law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But she did say that EBIA
had the burden to demonstrate error in the bankruptcy
courts.
MR. POTTOW:  That -- she does say that at
one point in her opinion.  But I believe if we read the
analysis in its context, it is clear that she's
according a full de novo review of the claims.  And I
think that -- I don't think she misunderstood the -- the
standard of review that should be done and the true de
novo nature of it.
But if I may, I'd like to comment on my
friend's backup argument.  If -- if the Court agrees
with me that Article III is not imperiled by consensual
adjudicative regimes like the magistrate's civil
judgments and the bankruptcy court noncore proceedings
which, by the way, I would like to remind the Court that
in Stern itself, you did quote Section 157(c)(2), which
is the noncore consensual proceedings in an opinion
exclusively devoted to Article III.
My friend says, well, as a backup, even if
that's constitutionally okay, I have to have notice that
I can withhold my consent.  And under the statute, it's
clear that on a noncore claim under 157(c)(2), the
parties have to consent.  And he says, but I had a Stern
claim so I didn't really know that I was a noncore claim
and could withhold my consent.
So it's a one-off, quirky argument he's
making because he had a Stern claim before Stern.
That's belied -- sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Go
ahead.
MR. POTTOW:  I was going to say, that's
belied by the pleadings in his -- in his answer to the
complaint, which is at page 80 of the Joint Appendix on
the jurisdictional allegations of the Trustee, this is a
core proceeding.  He says denied.  So he thought he had
a noncore proceeding.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're right.  We've
been talking about backup arguments to backup arguments.
Your central argument is that the consent of the parties
can overcome what Stern identified as a structural
separation of powers problem.
MR. POTTOW:  I would -- I would -- I would
slightly rephrase that, Mr. Chief Justice, and say what
Stern defined as the problem was the adjudication of the
private right without the consent of the parties.  So I
think it's already intrinsic in how Stern --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess that's
my question.  Is there any other case where we've said
the consent of the parties can overcome a constitutional
structural separation of powers?
MR. POTTOW:  Well, in the Heckers case,
which we cite in our material, the old -- the old
Special Master's case, that's what happened.  There was
a reference to a referee.  And when there's -- and it's
a -- it's a two-part thing, Mr. Chief Justice.  It's not
just the consent of the parties, remember; it's the
referral by the district court.  So if the district
court feels that its Article III authority is being
impinged upon, it has no obligation to refer matters out
to a bankruptcy judge.  The parties can say, we consent.
We want to go to the bankruptcy judge.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We've already told
the district court, haven't we, that its Article III
status is infringed when he refers or when there's a
reference to a non-Article III tribunal?
MR. POTTOW:  No, in -- I -- that's why I
said I think it's two necessary conditions.  I think
there has to be both district court permission to grant
the reference out and the consent of the parties.  Okay.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if the district
court refers the case to his law partners, and that's
fine with the parties, that law partner can enter a
final judgment in the case subject only to appellate
review?
MR. POTTOW:  That's what Heckers said.
Heckers -- and that -- that's basically --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that what you're
saying?
MR. POTTOW:  Yes, that's a Special Master.
That's what a Special Master is.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The Special Masters
do not enter final judgment subject only to appellate
review.
MR. POTTOW:  Well, technically if we want to
go to the procedure of what these equity officers
did, was they would prepare their report, and because
they're acting as officers of the court, and then the
clerk of court enters judgment.  So the adjudicative
thinking --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the appellate
review is the important thing.  The Article III court,
under your submission, is giving up its authority to
enter factual findings.  It's giving that authority to a
non-Article III tribunal, and it can only review those
findings under clearly erroneous standard.
MR. POTTOW:  That -- that is the current
system of the magistrate judges under 636.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I know it's
the current system under the magistrate judges.  We held
that unconstitutional in the bankruptcy context.
MR. POTTOW:  No, you held it
unconstitutional regarding an objecting defendant.
There's been hundreds of years of consensual
adjudication with these inferior judicial officers, as
that they were called in the earlier cases, such as
Go-Bart.
They are officers.  They're inferior
judicial officers, and they are controlled by the
Article III judiciary.  The Article III judiciary
retains the control to use them or not use them as they
want, and parties can't be forced to do them over their
-- without their consent.
So when this Court has had opportunity to
address Article III concerns of this, they have always
relied upon the lack of consent as a problem.  And
that's why this Court's formulation in Stern, I think,
is critical, just following Union Carbide, and indeed
every opinion in Northern Pipeline, going back to the
MacDonald case under the old act.  What matters
is the lack of consent.  Plenary matters can't be tried
without consent under the old Bankruptcy Act.  When
there is consent, this Court held in MacDonald,
that's fine.  Indeed, when there's implied consent, this
court held in Klein against Baker in the American
College's amicus brief, that's fine.
And as the American College also lays out
well, these old statutory cases under the old Bankruptcy
Act were interpreted with constitutional values in mind.
The old act was very cryptically drafted and tersely
drafted, so this Court used constitutional principles in
interpreting the scope of the old Bankruptcy Act and
upholding the consensual adjudication of plenary matters
when there is consent.
So our submission, Mr. Chief Justice, is
yes, we do think that the consent matters.  And the final
thing I'd like to say is, my friend cast this narrative.
He said, well, how do you know I consented through my
implied conduct to the noncore claim?  Remember, he did
plead it was noncore in his answer, and -- my red light.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Finish your
sentence.
MR. POTTOW:  I was going to say is that his
codefendant won before the very same bankruptcy judge.
So he made a tactical decision he is trying us to
second-guess ex post now that he's lost.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Gannon.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
We believe that a party may consent to have
a fraudulent conveyance claim determined by a bankruptcy
judge.  And even in the absence of consent, principles
of severability justify treating such an action as a
noncore proceeding in which a bankruptcy judge may enter
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
There's also one other aspect of our argument that has
not yet been mentioned this morning, which is that we
think that even if consent is not adequate to cure the
constitutional violation or if you find that there is
not adequate consent on this record, we think that it
would still be open to you to find that petitioner has
forfeited this constitutional argument.
Constitutional arguments can be forfeited.
He has not -- he did not advance this argument at any
point -- any reasonable point before the bankruptcy
judge, before the district judge, until he was before
the Court of Appeals.  Indeed, I think it's telling that
this Court had already granted certiorari in Stern and
had already heard oral argument in Stern before the
district court even ruled on the motion for summary
judgment.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's true, but if you were
in the Ninth Circuit, and I would have -- you would have
thought this was a core proceeding.
MR. GANNON:  You might have thought the same
thing.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So he says, you know, of
course I didn't object.  I am faced with all kinds of
precedent that say it's impossible; and therefore, there
is no reason to object.  That wasn't consent.
MR. GANNON:  If there was true futility --
and I'm not talking about the consent argument now,
Justice Breyer.  I'm talking about a forfeiture argument
for purposes of preserving an argument on appeal.  And
if it were truly futile, I think that a Court of Appeals
could overlook that type of forfeiture.  I don't think
that it was futile here.  I think it is demonstrated by
the fact that Stern itself came out of the Ninth
Circuit.  The litigants there were making those
arguments, and indeed the Healthcentral.Com case the
petitioner relies upon just had a discussion of the
Seventh Amendment.
I don't think it clearly foreclosed this
claim for purposes of the constitutional argument --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And the answer suggested
it because we he was claiming the fraudulent conveyance
claim in his answer was noncore.  So he had the basis of
the argument.
MR. GANNON:  Yes, I think it's -- he
certainly did, as my colleague already pointed out on
page 80 of the Joint Appendix and paragraph 2.1 of the
answer denied the allegation that this was a core
proceeding.
And if you look, then, to 157(c)(1) and (2),
the statute made consent relevant at that point, and
Rule 7012, which, Justice Sotomayor, you were earlier
quoting, made it clear that he was obliged, then, to --
or petitioner was obliged, then, to -- to give consent
or not.
But if I can turn to the severability
question, which was also the focus of a lot of the
argument before, Justice Scalia, you pointed out that
Congress can rewrite the statute the way it wants to.
And that's, of course, true.  But it is always the case
when this Court gets to a severability analysis that
Congress didn't get its first option.  Here, Congress
did include a severability clause in the 1984 Act.  It's
in Section 119, and it says, if any provision of this
statute or any application thereof is held to be
unconstitutional we want the rest to stand.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's what I
thought severability was.  If you carve -- if you find
part of it unconstitutional, you ask whether what is
left can stand.  You don't say that we're going to
rewrite what is left.
MR. GANNON:  I don't think any rewriting is
required here, Mr. Chief Justice.  And I think that this is
actually essentially what the Court has already said in
Stern.  In Stern, on page 2620, this Court characterized
the effect of its decision as being, "The removal of
Vicky's counterclaim there from core bankruptcy
jurisdiction."
And the consequence of that is that, because
the Congress had divided the world into core and noncore
proceedings in the wake of Northern Pipeline, thinking
that the distinction between them was core proceedings
were ones in which bankruptcy judges would have
authority, constitutional authority to enter final
judgments; noncore proceedings were ones in which they
could not do that without consent, or they would only be
able to provide proposed findings of fact and
conclusions of law.
And in the same paragraph where this Court noted
that the effect of its decision was effectively to
remove this, that type of counterclaim from core
jurisdiction, it said that it did not expect that this
decision would meaningfully change the division of labor
between the bankruptcy and district court judges,
precisely because Pearce Marshall was not contesting the
idea that bankruptcy judges would still be able to enter
proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or it may be because
the particular claim at issue in Stern was one that
wasn't expected to arise in the normal course in
bankruptcy proceedings.
MR. GANNON:  Well, that -- that may be
something the Court was thinking.  In that particular
paragraph, the Court mentioned the fact that Pearce
Marshall was not contesting the district court's ability
to take proposed findings of fact and conclusions of
law.
And as Mr. Pottow already observed, many
district courts have already taken this action in
response to Stern.  In the appendix to our brief at
pages 15A to 17A, we list 25 of those districts.  Since
our brief was filed, two more districts have adopted
similar provisions in Rhode Island and in New Hampshire.
And we think that that is telling.
I also think, with respect to the underlying
constitutional claim, if I could elaborate a little bit
on what my colleague was saying in response to the
questions from the Chief Justice about instances in
which Article III judges may indeed delegate the ability
to enter certain decisions with which the district
court's subsequent ability to over -- to look over that
decision will be cabined by the action that has happened
with the consent of the parties.
My friend was talking about the Heckers
case.  That was one in which the order of reference
specifically provided that judgment would be entered in
conformity with a referee's report, "as if the cause had
been heard before the court."
And so that was -- that was one where the
district court didn't come into it at that point.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your -- your
position is -- I mean, the authority to decide cases,
which is our Constitutional birthright, we said in Stern
that Congress can't take that away from us.  And your
position is that two parties who come in off the street,
if they agree, they can take that away from us.
MR. GANNON:  Depending.  I think that under
the circumstances here -- and this Court has repeatedly,
in the context of considering Article III objections in
bankruptcy, has repeatedly recognized that the absence
of consent is relevant.  Under Schor, and the Court is
obliged, I think, to look into all the circumstances
surrounding this, and there are lots of things that make
this far from the hypothetical that you pose, because
this is more like the magistrate judge scheme.  And,
indeed, in some ways it's slightly more limited.
This is an instance where bankruptcy judges
are not just somebody off the street that a district
court is choosing to decide --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, it's the
parties, the parties who are --
MR. GANNON:  It's not the parties that are
choosing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You said, "It's the
consent of the parties that allows a proceeding we have
determined to be unconstitutional to go forward."
MR. GANNON:  You determined that it was
unconstitutional in the absence of consent, and it's not
just the consent of the parties.  I think it is
important here, as it was in -- in the magistrate judge
context in Roell, in Peretz, in Gomez.  This Court has
previously recognized that in the magistrate judge
context, consent makes or breaks the difference between
whether it's okay for a magistrate judge to oversee
felony voir dire, and it has subsequently compared that
to entry of civil judgments.  In Roell, it sustained the
ability of a magistrate judge to enter a civil judgment.
Here, bankruptcy judges are not just people
off the street chosen by the parties.  They are people
who are appointed by Article III judges.  They are
removable only by Article III judges.  They never get a
case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The point of
everything that you said is, they do not comply with
Article III.
MR. GANNON:  They themselves are not Article
III judges, that is certainly true.  But they never get
a case unless it is referred to them by an Article III
judge, and then the Article III judge reserves the
ability to withdraw the reference and, therefore, they
don't have -- they are now unable to do anything without
that imprimatur from the district court, and I --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Gannon --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does the district
court have that authority after the entry of judgment?
MR. GANNON:  I -- I don't think as a
statutory matter that 157(d), which is the provision
that allows the district court to withdraw the
reference, it's possible that that can't be done at that
point, but I think that it is sensible as a matter of
constitutional remedy.  If the -- if the entry of final
judgment by the bankruptcy court was a constitutional
violation, I think it is a sensible remedy, as I
discussed before, to deem that final judgment to be
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
This Court concluded in Stern, that subject matter
jurisdiction is vested in the district court and that
the allocation of authority between bankruptcy judges
and district judges contained in Section 157 is not of
subject matter jurisdictional consequences.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Gannon, could you say a
word about the relevance of arbitration here?  Because
I've been trying to figure out, if there's an Article
III problem irrespective of consent when Congress adopts
some kind of scheme for alternative adjudication, why
schemes of mediation and arbitration wouldn't similarly
be constitutionally problematic.
MR. GANNON:  I -- obviously, we don't think
that -- that these schemes here in the bankruptcy judge
context and the magistrate judge context, which are --
which are hedged around with lots of procedural
protections and statutory protections, rise to that
level.  But I do think that a principal difference, if
the Court were looking to distinguish arbitration from
these types of concerns, is that the arbitration is more
purely private.
Although there's statutory authorization,
the arbitrators are generally not Federal employees.
Bankruptcy judges, by contrast, are actually units of
the district courts.  They are within Article III.  They
are --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but that would suggest
that arbitration is more constitutionally problematic
because it -- it extends -- you know, it goes -- it's
further away from the supervisory authority of the
district court.
MR. GANNON:  I'm -- I'm loathe to say that
it's further away because I think that there may be a
separation of powers distinction between --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Arbitration is a
matter of contract between two parties.  Nothing happens
in an arbitration until you get a district court to
enter a judgment enforcing the contract.  It seems to me
totally different from the situation we're talking about
here.
MR. GANNON:  Well, I do --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  A matter of contract versus
a matter of consent?  Like I said, you understand the
difference.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you -- I'm
posing a question to you, I guess.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Courts enforce
contracts all the time.  They don't enter judgments
beyond their Article III authority simply because the
two parties before them agree that they should.
MR. GANNON:  That's true, Mr. Chief Justice.
In cases like Heckers and Kimberly, courts, in light of
a previous reference from the Court and the consent of
the parties agreed to have their power of de novo review
limited.  Obviously that's not what happened here, but
we think that the judgment of the decision below should
be affirmed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, you have five
minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice.
I have four points in response.  First with
respect to the history.  Hecker's and Kimberly were not
instances in which the non-Article III actor entered the
judgment of the United States.
In Hecker's, the Court compared the
referee's actions akin to a jury.  And a jury, of
course, only finds facts.  Only the court can decide
whether to enter judgment on the basis of the jury's
verdict.  Likewise an arbitrator can decide facts
pursuant to the parties' contract, but until they bring
it to the court and judgment is entered confirming --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What are we supposed to
assume here on this point?  In Thomas, this Court held
that what Northern Pipeline establishes is that Congress
cannot vest in a non-Article III court the power to
adjudicate without consent of the litigants.  So that's
the holding.
Now, if we are going to go back into Crowell and
Benson and the power of agencies and whether we want to reverse
the things that were held in 1938 and so forth, I guess we
should have briefing on that.  Am I supposed to assume
that this is a case -- I thought I assumed what we have
held before in respect to constitutionality.  Not
whether Northern Pipeline extends to where it is with
consent of the parties.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Although Northern
Pipeline, because the party had objected, did not
address the question whether consent --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, you heard what I read
from Thomas.  I was just reading it, and it talks about
without consent.  So what I want to know is are we going
to open up these issues again?  Because I have my own
views on that, but they don't necessarily -- they won't
necessarily command a majority, but I think we should
have briefing.
(Laughter.)
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No, Your Honor.
Because the earlier cases do not establish an authority
to enter judgment of the United States by a --
JUSTICE BREYER:  My question is are we
supposed to go into that or do we just take as assumed
what Thomas said and Stern said, and I think -- you know
what I said.  I don't want to repeat myself.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, Thomas
certainly does not foreclose the argument that I'm
making because --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They didn't say that it's
okay without consent.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They just say it is okay
with consent.  They didn't address the point.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's right, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I think we should have
briefing on the point if we are going into it.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  And Kimberly,
again, referred to the confirmation of the award, again
the judgment being entered by the court.
The -- in Roell, which really marks the
furthest extent of the recognition of consent and the
role that it can play with respect to judgments and, of
course, the Article III argument was not advanced by the
parties there.  Both parties agreed that consent would
be sufficient.  But significantly, even in Roell, the
Court said that the consent would have to be knowing and
voluntary consent.  And we have the opposite of that
here.  Because both the legislature and the judiciary
had told EBIA that it had no right to an Article III
judge for pretrial motions.
And although my friend --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you had an
outstanding motion to withdraw the reference.  And the
district court gave you the option of proceeding with
that motion and having it determine the rest of the case
or to go and listen -- or go back to the bankruptcy
court and let the bankruptcy court manage this and you
chose the latter.  I think obviously for the reasons
your -- your adversary speaks about, because your
co-defendant had won in bankruptcy court.  I think you
were riding your chances.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No, Your Honor, to
the contrary, and we don't need to hypothesize because
the record is clear, the motion was to withdraw for
purpose of conducting a jury trial because our client
recognized that Ninth Circuit precedent
Healthcentral.Com explicitly held after Granfinanciera,
that although you might have a Seventh Amendment jury
trial right to an Article III judge, that did not
entitle you to Article III determination of pretrial
motions including summary judgment motion on a
fraudulent conveyance claim.  It was directly on point.
Our client cited that, recognized it, it had no right to
Article III court prior to trial.
So the motion to withdraw was limited to the
motion for a trial if the court got that far.  So the
suggestion that in the answer we disputed that
fraudulent conveyance actions are core is not consistent
with the record.
The complaint had listed eight causes of
action, several of which were core, several noncore, and
then a single concluding allegation that the proceeding
was core.  Under Ninth Circuit law we rightly denied
that allegation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
