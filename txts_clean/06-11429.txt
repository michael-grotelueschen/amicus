CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

United States.
Mr. Fisher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The rule of lenity requires that any penal
statute the government seeks to enforce against an
individual must clearly and unambiguous apply to him
and, as the government acknowledges its brief in this
case, this Court has applied the rule of lenity in
numerous recent cases involving mandatory sentencing
provisions. A reaffirmation of that time-honored
principle is all that is necessary to decide this case.
The 20-year mandatory --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it time-honored since
Granderson? Is that the first time we did it?
MR. FISHER: Well, the rule of lenity has
been --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: As to sentences? As to
sentences?
MR. FISHER: As to sentencing? No, in the
mid-20th century, Justice Kennedy, in the Bell decision
written by Justice Frankfurter and in Ladner, both
involved the degree of punishment which the defendant
would receive. There are other cases: In 1980 the
Simpson case, and Bifulco around the same time. So this
Court has a history of applying the rule of lenity with
equal force to sentencing provisions as it does to
statutes demarcating criminal conduct or not. And of
course, as the green brief specially highlights, the
very essence and the core of the rule of lenity derives
from the English common law, which is -- which was
designed to invoke the rule of lenity to avoid mandatory
punishment, not -- not so much whether conduct was
criminal or not.
So we think that applying that rule in a
straightforward manner to this case requires a reversal.
The 20-year mandatory minimum in Section 841(b)(1)(A)
applies only to defendants who have a prior conviction
for a, quote, "felony drug offense." Now, a sensible
reading of that provision is that a State law
misdemeanor simply does not constitute a felony drug
offense.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if the
rule of lenity depends upon of course some ambiguity in
the term, the definition says "'felony drug offense'
means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for
more than 1 year." It doesn't say anything about State
classification.
MR. FISHER: That's right, Mr. Chief
Justice, and if that's all you had on the statute books
this might be an easier case. But as you know, I think,
above section 44 and section 13 the term "felony" is
described and defined as "a crime that is classified as
a felony under Federal or State law." And so when you
start with section 841(b)(1)(A), which uses the term
"felony drug offense," and you go to the definitional
section, the first thing you come to is the definition
of felony, which says a crime classified as such. And
then, as you say, in section 44 you reach another
definition. So we think that at the very least you have
an ambiguity here in which Congress has given two
facially applicable definitions to the operative
provision of the statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, obviously one
is a definition of "felony" and the other is the
definition of "felony drug offense" and the term that's
at issue here is "felony drug offense."
MR. FISHER: Well, in a sense it's our
position that both are at issue here. The term
"felony," which is within the term "felony drug
offense," is also at issue here. And as we've pointed
out in pages 11 and 12, 11 and 12 of our yellow brief,
it's not uncommon for Congress to have two separate
definitions one of which is a single term within a
broader term in a statute. And so the mere fact, as the
government would argue, that the word "felony" is not
repeated in the definition of subsection 44 does not
mean that Congress meant that to be the sole definition.
We've given three examples on pages 11 and
where the sensible reading of the statute is that
Congress attempted to nest the definition of a single
term within the definition of a broader term.
JUSTICE ALITO: Could I -- could I ask you
what you think Congress might have been trying to do
with the 1994 amendment under -- under your reading?
Before 1994 the offense had to be classified as a
felony. Then they added this definition of "felony drug
offense," and as I understand it your reading is that
now the offense must be classified as a felony and it
must be punishable by more, by imprisonment for more
than a year. What would be the reason for adding this
new requirement as you see it, that it be punishable by
more than a year, if there were not offenses that were
classified by States as felonies but were punishable by
less than a year? I can't see the point unless the
point was to rule those out.
And you haven't cited any State statute in
your brief that involved an offense that was classified
as a felony and is punishable by less than a year. You
cited a couple that were punishable by exactly a year,
not more than a year but exactly a year. So is it your,
your theory that the reason for adding this new language
was to make it clear that those offenses where the
maximum was 12 months, as opposed to 12 months and a
day, would not be counted?
MR. FISHER: I think there is an agreement
between us and the government on this point. We cite in
our blue brief statutes from Arizona as well as a couple
of other States where there are crimes that are
classified as felonies but punishable in less than a
year. And in those cases we agree with the government
that that is the effect of the 1994 conforming
amendments, is to exclude those outlier States that take
low-level crimes and nonetheless classify them as
felonies. What this case is about --
JUSTICE ALITO: But if I could just come
back to that. I looked at those. You cite Ohio, North
Carolina, and Arizona and those are all punishable by --
they all have a maximum term of 12 months, not less
than. So the difference is between 12 months and 12
months and a day?
MR. FISHER: Well, that works on the
language of the statute, Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO: But is it plausible that's
the reason why Congress added this language? They
didn't want -- they wanted to make sure that these
felonies that were punishable by just 12 months would
not be counted?
MR. FISHER: Well, I think it is quite
plausible that the language that Congress added has very
little practical effect. And that flows from the fact
that Congress called these nothing more than conforming
amendments, so Congress apparently wasn't trying to
accomplish any dramatic change here and I think it might
help to understand by looking at the other outlier
states that the government claims got swept in with the
94 amendments. We cite statutes from States like
Colorado. Perhaps if I used a concrete example. Take
possession of a single ounce of marijuana. That is one
of the crimes in Arizona that we were just talking
about, that is a felony punishable by no more than a
year. There are a few other States who are outliers in
a different sense, in which they call these crimes
misdemeanors, like the vast majority of States, but make
them punishable by 18 months or more.
And so what the government's position is is
that in 1994 when Congress passed a conforming amendment
to exclude a couple of outlier States like Arizona, it
was trying to sweep in for the first time into section
1(b)(1)(A) outlier States like Colorado that treat
low-level drug crimes, low-level drug possession crimes,
as misdemeanors that are punishable by more than a year.
So we think, for the very reasons the
government explains, that Congress is trying to avoid
disuniformity and happenstance according to how a few
local jurisdictions might treat certain drug crimes,
that it makes sense to read the '94 conforming
amendments as requiring both the one-year punishment
rule and the felony classification requirement.
And if you have any doubt on that, we submit
it really makes sense to remember that what we're what
talking about here is a mandatory minimum. And so --
JUSTICE ALITO: What would you do with
someone who was convicted -- had a prior conviction of
-- for importing 10 tons of heroin in New Jersey, for
example, where there are no felonies? What would you do
with that, a very serious drug offense in a State that
doesn't use the term "felony" at all or a foreign
conviction?
MR. FISHER: Well, we've cited a case in our
brief in the Second Circuit that deals with that exact
problem, at least with the New Jersey problem. And what
the courts did and what they have done in other
circumstances where there's a felony classification
requirement is they simply take the crime in New Jersey
and analogize it to a comparable Federal or local State
crime, and if it was -- if it would be classified as a
felony in that local jurisdiction, then courts -- and
this is even before the 1994 amendments -- courts have
treated it as a felony.
JUSTICE ALITO: But what they did -- what
they did in the Second Circuit case was to say this is
punishable -- this offense is punishable by more than a
year in New Jersey and therefore it's a felony.
MR. FISHER: I believe, Justice Alito, this
was a case before 1994, so that's --
JUSTICE ALITO: I know. And that's how they
analogized it to a felony.
MR. FISHER: Right, because that is the
Federal definition of a felony, and so that was the
analogy that the Second Circuit was able to draw here
and reach what we think is a commonsense way to deal
with the unusual problem of New Jersey. Another --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You say there are other
examples where a -- a noun that is nested in another
definition is separately defined and the two are read
together. How are those phrased? I mean, I could
understand what you say if this provision here read "The
term 'felony drug offense' means a felony that is
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year."
Then I'd go back to the "felony" definition for what a
felony means, but it doesn't repeat the "felony." "The
term 'felony drug offense' means an offense that is
punishable by imprisonment for" -- do any of the
examples of nesting that you -- that you bring forward
read this way?
MR. FISHER: All three of them do, Justice
Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Which ones are they? Where
are they --
MR. FISHER: They're pages 11 and 12 of the
yellow brief. And so the first place to start is
looking at the bottom of page 11, where the term
"employee" is defined in one provision of the Federal --
of the Federal statutory code. And then the terms
"employee of the Capitol Police," "employee of the House
of Representatives" are also defined, and they're
defined -- and those broader definitions are in the
footnote at the bottom of page 12. And so you see that
there, after having defined the term "employee," the
word "employee" is not repeated in those definitions.
They talk about "a member" or "an officer" or "an
individual." And so it's much like the circumstance
here, where a more generic term is used in the broader
definition, but it makes sense to read in the original
definition.
The same thing I think you can see in the
middle of page 12 with the part of the Bankruptcy Code
that we've given this Court. The word "debtor" is
defined in a certain way, and then later on in the
definitional provision, the term "debtor's principal
residence" is defined as "a residential structure" and
such and such. Again the word "debtor" is not repeated
in the broader definition, but we think the only way to
make sense of it is to import the definition of the
single term into the broader term. If Congress had
wanted --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just on that -- just
on that last one, are you saying that if it doesn't say
"debtor's residential structure," you'd think it was
somebody else's residential structure?
MR. FISHER: Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand
the point.
MR. FISHER: Well, there might be, you know,
a very rigid plain-text argument that might be made.
The point is that Congress used -- defined the term
"debtor's principal residence" without using the term
"debtor" again and defined it somewhere else. My --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in a provision
of the Bankruptcy Code that deals with debtors I don't
think there's any question about whose residential
structure they would be talking about, even though they
don't repeat "debtor." It strikes me as quite different
than the provision we have before us today.
MR. FISHER: Well, then I think I'd refer
you back to the employee example. I mean, no example is
going to be exactly on all fours. I'm happy to
acknowledge that. The idea that I'm trying to get
across is it's not unusual for Congress to define single
terms that are nested within larger terms.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- better example. It
doesn't quite work because it does not supersede the
term "debtor" that was used earlier. In the
government's submission at least in this case, "felony
drug offense" supersedes the earlier provision in
section 13.
MR. FISHER: I think that's right. And I
think one way to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me they're
not comparable in that sense.
MR. FISHER: Okay. I think one way to
understand how this statute -- if Congress had wanted to
do what the government says it wanted to do, how
Congress could have made it absolutely clear -- while we
have the yellow brief open, we can look at page 13.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a question
before going on with this line? You say that both the
2(13) definition has to be satisfied and the 44
definition, right? But was 802(13) ever applicable to
this situation? What was the law prior to the 1994
amendment? There was a section, wasn't there, that
defined "felony drug offense"?
MR. FISHER: For a time, yes, Justice
Ginsburg, but -- so when the statute was originally
passed, 802(13) was the sole definition of "felony," and
then somewhere along the line between the original
enactment and the '94 amendments, a definition of
"felony drug offense" was put into 841(b)(1)(A) --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.
MR. FISHER: -- but that itself just used
the word "felony," which again referred the reader back
to 802(13). So, again, I think there is an agreement
between --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you take a look at
that provision that was in 841(b)(1)? Because it seems
that it would be duplicative of 802(13).
MR. FISHER: Are you looking, Justice
Ginsburg, at the 1988 version of the statute?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. FISHER: No, because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where would we find this?
MR. FISHER: Oh, this is at 13a of the blue
brief, Justice Scalia.
So, at page 13a it says, "For purposes of
this subparagraph, the term 'felony drug offense' means
an offense that is a felony under any provision of this
subchapter, under any Federal law." Now, the word
"felony" again would have referred the reader back to
2(13). If I understand --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But read -- read the end
of it. Read on where it says, "or a felony under any
law of a State or foreign country," et cetera.
MR. FISHER: Right. But I think, again, the
word "felony" as it appears in -- in that provision --
and I think that the government agrees with us on this
-- would have referred the reader back to 802(13) as of
88 --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what --
MR. FISHER: -- because there isn't the
explicit classification requirement.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it defines what the
felony is: "A felony under any law of a State or
foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct
relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana," et cetera.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think the latter
language, Justice Ginsburg, is defining --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would you need to
look --
MR. FISHER: -- "drug offense," whereas the
word "felony" I think is not a self-defining term in
that statute as it's written. And to understand whether
we're talking about something like a one-year rule or a
classification requirement, the reader needs to go back
to the definitional section.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- the definitional
section contradicts -- contradicts what's in (b)(1)(A).
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. FISHER: As of 1988?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. It contradicts it
because the "felony" definition is classified as felony
by Federal or State law.
MR. FISHER: Well, it says "a felony under
the law of a State." So I think the classification
requirement -- I don't think it's inconsistent with it.
It might clarify it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is "under any
provision of this subchapter or any other Federal law
that prohibits or restricts." And then in the last
part, "under any law of a" -- of "State" -- it picks up
"State" -- "or a foreign country." "Foreign country" is
not included in 802(13).
MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you have to say that
there "felony" stands on its own, right?
MR. FISHER: Well, I guess you could, but
then you wouldn't have a definition; then you'd have to
figure out how to define "felony," whether it was a
classification or a one-year rule or something else. I
think the natural reading, again, would be a
classification requirement to the extent to which you
couldn't look further than that provision of the
statute, but --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is the following true, that
if you are right the reason Congress passed this new
definition was it wanted to take those handful of States
which have felonies as a year, the ones Justice Alito is
talking about, and make clear that they are not covered?
MR. FISHER: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But if the
government's right, then the reason Congress did this is
that it recognized what I think is the truth, that
felonies and misdemeanors are defined differently in
many different ways under the laws of many different
States and, in a matter where so much prison time turns
on it, wished to create a single, uniform definition.
Now, if that's right, I'm asking myself
which is a more plausible purpose.
MR. FISHER: Well, we don't disagree with
the government that the one-year rule does serve the
purpose of helping iron out --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't, because if
you're right, then you first have to look to the
patchwork quilt of laws in all the different States to
see whether those different States define the conduct as
misdemeanors or felonies. And then, having solved the
patchwork problem, we add on the requirement of one
year. And so the bite of the new definition would be
what Justice Alito said and nothing else.
Now, that's -- and, yet, on the government's
interpretation, the bite is to create a single, readily
applied, uniform rule.
Now, if I ask myself which of those is most
plausible, I hate to tell you which answer I get.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think, Justice Breyer,
with due respect, if you look at the way different
States treat drug crimes --
JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right? Am I right? I
mean, I put that out to give you a chance to say. I'm
not sure I am right.
MR. FISHER: That's what I'm trying to
respond -- different States treat drug crimes
dramatically different, and this is so -- I think it's
common sense that States treat different crimes -- treat
-- different States punish the same crime differently.
And that's nowhere more true than in drug crime, because
there's a great amount of experimentation that goes on
in the States. And one of the things that certain
States do, like Colorado, is take very low-level drug
crimes and punish them by more than a year, in part so
they can give treatment and keep people in, prison, long
enough to have treatment take hold, whereas some other
States treat drug crimes very differently. So you have
a patchwork whether you look to the classification or
whether you look to the one-year rule. That's why we
think it makes sense to use both.
Now, if Congress had wanted to do what the
government is suggesting, which is have the one-year
rule be the sole and exclusive way of determining
whether you have a felony before you, it could have very
easily said so. And there's an example -- and this is
at page 13 of the yellow brief -- of what -- of what the
Federal Sentencing Guidelines do.
They define -- in a "career-offender
provision" there is a definition of "felony" there that
is quite explicit. They say a "felony" is "an offense
punishable by more than a year, regardless of whether
such an offense is specifically designated as a
'felony.'"
So there are other provisions where Congress
could have looked and it would have been well aware of
how to make absolutely plain what it was trying to
accomplish in the statute.
Now, we don't think that the government's
reading is implausible, Justice Breyer, for the reason
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, could I just
go back to what you quoted. Are you quoting -- you're
quoting a Sentencing Guideline, right?
MR. FISHER: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not a statute.
MR. FISHER: Yes, I'm quoting the Sentencing
Guideline, although in the Armed Career Criminal Act you
can find another place where Congress dealt with this
problem explicitly.
It said that felonies are crimes punishable
more than a year; however, if the State classifies the
crime as a misdemeanor, it has to be punishable by more
than two years.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think -- you think it
would mean something different if you just left out the
"regardless of" clause?
MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Scalia, with the
problem --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The "prior adult Federal or
State conviction for an offense punishable by death or
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year," you think
it means something different without the "regardless".
MR. FISHER: Not necessarily, but leaving
that clause --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not at all? Not possibly.
MR. FISHER: Well, our position is, Justice
Scalia, that, standing alone, I will grant you; but the
problem as we see it in this case is that that is left
out. In a very common problem, how to define a felony,
they leave out that explicit statement of whether
classification is important. And what is more, in the
same definitional provision --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I would say that
"regardless" clause is extraordinary and I would not
want to have to deal with such prolix statutes on a
regular basis.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think there's a good
reason why Congress put it in, and that's because it is
a continually vexing problem, how to define what is a
felony. That's why Congress did it explicitly in the
Armed Career Criminal Act. That's why the Sentencing
Guidelines are explicit here. And leaving that out, and
against the backdrop of a statute where the
classification rule was the controlling rule for over a
decade, and where they leave that classification rule in
the very same definitional provision of the statute, we
think, gives rise to an ambiguity.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's such a
vexing problem, why would Congress have incorporated the
problem into the definition of "felony drug offense"?
MR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure I follow the
question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you seem to
suggest that it's a vexing problem that "felony" is
defined differently in different States. And, yet, you
say that the term "felony," which relies on how it's
defined by different States, was incorporated in the
--
felony drug offense, which seems to have a quite clear
definition of punishable by more than one year.
If they don't want to repeat the problem
that "felony" is defined differently in different
States, they would not do what you're suggesting, which
is incorporate it wholesale into the latter definition.
MR. FISHER: Well, with all due respect,
what Congress did is they left 802(13) on the books,
which does turn on classifications. And it's not --
even though it is a -- it is something of a patchwork,
it is not unusual at all to have very serious
consequences turn on whether something is classified as
a "felony" or not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, of course, they had
to leave it on the books because they need a definition
of "felony." "Felony" has to be defined in many places,
but this is a definition of "felony drug offense." So
MR. FISHER: Well, again, Justice Ginsburg,
I think that is right. But then what Congress could
have done is use the language that the Federal
Sentencing Guidelines use, or something comparable to
make clear its intent.
And the classification of a felony or not a
felony, as this Court knows, has a time-honored import.
Things like the right to vote, the right to bear arms,
the right to various civil rights turn on whether
somebody has been convicted of a felony or a
misdemeanor.
And, again, this brings us in a sense back
to the rule of lenity because one of the principal
reasons for the rule of lenity is fair notice. Now,
this Court, as early as the McBoyle decision recognized
that we're dealing with something of a fiction when we
imagine an offender is looking at the statutory books to
decide whether certain conduct is prohibited or not.
But in the context of recidivist
enhancements that lead to mandatory minimums, we're
talking about very real and serious notice problems.
Imagine the conscientious public defender advising
someone like Mr. Burgess as to whether he should plead
guilty to a misdemeanor or a felony. This happens in
States across the country that have three-strike
provisions, that have very serious immigration
consequences turning on "felony" or "misdemeanor." That
lawyer might have concluded, as the District of Columbia
Circuit did, that pleading to a misdemeanor here would
not expose Mr. Burgess in the event he was convicted of
a later crime to such a serious punishment as the
-year mandatory minimum in this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what
happened in South Carolina? Could he on those facts and
under the charges have been sentenced to more than a
year? It was just that the judge gave him less than a
year?
MR. FISHER: Mr. Burgess's crime, possession
of cocaine, was punishable by up to two years. So, yes,
he received a sentence far less than that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But he, himself, was
eligible for the --
MR. FISHER: Yes. The crime to which he
pled guilty was punishable by two years. But you should
understand that that kind of hypothetical, punishable-by
problem is one I know this Court dealt with a couple of
months ago in the Rodriguez case. And you should
understand that not just what Congress, under the
government's view, had been looking to sweep in outlier
States like Colorado, but if the government prevails in
the Rodriguez case where the term "punishable by" turns
on recidivist enhancements, then the 1994 amendments,
which were termed "conforming amendments," have an even
far more sweeping effect and bring in lots of State-law
misdemeanors that were never covered by the prior act.
If there are no more questions, I will
reserve my time.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Just one. You said that
in most States what Burgess did, his crime, simple
possession, would not encounter a sentence of upward of
one year. Did you do a survey? Did you document that
in your brief?
MR. FISHER: No. But I said earlier,
Justice Ginsburg, giving the example of possession of
one ounce of marijuana, that the vast majority of States
punished that as a misdemeanor by less than a year.
Mr. Burgess's crime, at best, was a
misdemeanor punishable by less than a year under Federal
law, but different States treat that crime differently.
And I think a majority of those, a majority of States,
would treat that as a crime punishable by more than a
year and classified as a "felony.
If there are no more questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Saharsky.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE SAHARSKY
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Congress answered the question presented in
this case when it adopted an express definition for
"felony drug offense." Under that definition, "felony
drug offense" means an offense punishable by more than
one year of imprisonment under certain State, Federal,
or foreign drug laws.
There is no textual basis for going beyond
that definition to also require that an offense be
classified as a "felony." The enhancement trigger in
the sentencing-enhancement provision is a felony drug
offense, and the way that the definition works is that
you take the definition Congress provided for "felony
drug offense."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is "drug" a nested
term in that? It doesn't really define "drug." Do they
look somewhere else for that definition?
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the term "felony drug
offense," the "drug" component we understand to be the
component that says "an offense" that prohibits --
"under law that prohibits or restricts conduct related
to narcotic drugs, marijuana, anabolic steroids" --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a place you
would -- is that a place you would look if you didn't
know what they meant by "drug"? If an issue arose
whether, you know, a natural narcotic, I mean is that a
drug or not?
MS. SAHARSKY: There is a definition of
"drug" at the beginning of the Controlled Substances Act
in section 802. It refers back to the general
definition of "drug," I believe in section 321 of the
Controlled --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that is nested in
this definition, "felony drug offense"?
MS. SAHARSKY: The term "felony drug
offense" has only the meaning that Congress gave to it.
In the words it shows that it be punishable by more than
one year under State, Federal or foreign law relating to
those particular drugs.
In fact, the question that you asked shows
why Petitioner's reading of the statute cannot be
correct, that you can't use both the definition of
"felony drug offense" that Congress provided and try to
import in separate definitions for "felony" and separate
definitions for "drug," because the definition of "drug"
in the Controlled Substances Act is very broad and
applies to many different kinds of drugs, whereas the
definition of "felony drug offense" only refers to
offenses that involve narcotic drugs, anabolic steroids,
marijuana or depressant or stimulant substances.
In the same way, this shows why Petitioner
cannot be correct that the definition of "felony" also
must be brought into "felony drug offense," because
Congress chose that the measure of seriousness in
"felony drug offense" is an offense punishable by more
than one year. And it actually took out of the statute
the measure of seriousness which is classification as a
felony. So to bring that requirement back in would undo
the change that Congress made in 1994.
That's the language, Justice Ginsburg, that
we were looking at at the bottom of the -- at the back
of the blue book. In 1988 it said "'Felony drug
offense' means an offense which is a felony." And that
language was taken out and Congress replaced it with
this new language, which says "punishable by more than
one year of imprisonment."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with
your friend's argument that the classification -- or the
term, more than one year or less than one year, doesn't
always have to do with how serious they view the
offense, but they may impose a sentence of more than one
year to allow time for rehabilitation?
MS. SAHARSKY: Congress chose the words that
it did, "punishable by more than one year," because it
believed it to be a good measure of seriousness. This
Court has recognized in cases like Blanton versus City
of North Las Vegas that the term of imprisonment that a
legislature chooses is a good measure of the seriousness
of the offense. There may be offenses that a State
classifies as more or less serious based on punishment,
but Congress wanted to do its best to get uniformity in
provision -- in this provision. So what it did here was
to take out this requirement that would look to varying
State and foreign laws and instead have one that was
just based on term of imprisonment.
And actually this -- this raises a very
serious problem with Petitioner's reading of the
statute, which is with respect to foreign offenses. The
"felony drug offense" definition allows an enhancement
based on State, Federal or foreign offenses, and the
definition of "felony" unadorned and standing by itself
doesn't refer to foreign offenses at all, which means
that there is a serious ambiguity if both apply as to
what would be done in the case of trying to enhance
based on a foreign offense.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I suppose it might
for countries that use that classification, for common
law countries.
MS. SAHARSKY: There are countries that do
use the felony- misdemeanor distinction. There are some
that do not. But we understand in 1994 that Congress --
the change Congress made to be one that eliminates those
kinds of ambiguities.
And certainly, if Congress had thought in
94 that both the separate definition of felony and the
definition of felony drug offense mattered, that it
would have placed foreign offenses in the definition of
felony, and it didn't do that here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the information we
have in the brief says that there are two States that
have dropped those labels. Are there more than New
Jersey and Maine?
MS. SAHARSKY: New Jersey and Maine are the
only ones that I'm aware of.
Certainly, as this Court discussed in some
previous questions, there may be ways in which courts
could try to work around ambiguities that, for example,
existed in the statute 1990 -- prior to 1994, to figure
out how offenses in New Jersey should be treated. But
the fact that Congress made the change in 1994 to pick
clear language that would just turn on the authorized
term of imprisonment shows that that's what should be
used, that choice should be given effect.
The fact that courts might be able to deal
with an ambiguous statute certainly does not give
license to create one where it doesn't otherwise exist.
There's an example the Petitioner raised,
which is how violent felonies are treated in the Armed
Career Criminal Act, and I think that that -- that
illustrates how Congress could have done what Petitioner
wanted if that was, in fact, its intent. In the ACCA, a
violent felony, which could be the basis for a sentence
enhancement, is defined as various violent offenses that
are punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year. But
then Congress specifically decided that it wanted to
exempt state misdemeanor offenses that it didn't
consider serious enough to qualify as violent felonies.
So it exempted State offenses that are classified as
misdemeanors and punishable by less than two years. And
we think that the Congress' treatment in the ACCA
exempting specific State offenses shows that if Congress
had wanted to exempt offenses classified as misdemeanors
in the way that Petitioner suggests, then it would have
done so in that way.
Congress chose a meaning here for "felony
drug offense" and we think that it needs to be given
effect.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell us just a
little bit about the rule of lenity? You want us to
apply sort of a watered down discount rule of lenity in
sentencing cases? And do you have authority for that?
MS. SAHARSKY: The government --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: After we said in
Granderson the rule of lenity applies without qualifying
or modifying it at all.
MS. SAHARSKY: The government's position is
that the rule of lenity operates in the same manner in
both the defining the offense context and in the
sentencing context. The point that we were making in
our brief is that the purposes behind the rule of lenity
are really implicated to a lesser extent when we're
talking about sentencing, and particularly with respect
to mandatory minimums, because there's not a question of
whether the offense conduct at issue is illegal, and
there's not a question about the maximum offense, the
maximum term of imprisonment that the person could be
subject to.
So, our brief should be best understood as a
response to Petitioner's extensive historical discussion
of the rule of lenity and a suggestion that it applies
with even more vigor in the context of mandatory
minimums. We don't think that that's the case, but at
the same time we are not suggesting there is a new
different rule of lenity in this context.
And again, we don't see this as a rule of
lenity case. Congress picked a particular definition
and it used those terms -- that term "felony drug
offense" to trigger each of the sentencing enhancement
provisions here. We don't think there is any reason to
look beyond it.
If the Court has no further questions,
Government submits the judgment below should be
affirmed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.
Saharsky.
Mr. Fisher, you have four minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
If I might pick up where Justice Kennedy
left off with the rule of lenity, because we don't want
this Court to lose sight of the importance of the rule
of lenity in this case. It's not our position that the
government's reading is unreasonable. It is simply our
position that our reading of the statute is a possible
one and that Congress may have been --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but there has to be
a real ambiguity. I mean, if there is a plausible
defendant-friendly interpretation, that doesn't trigger
the rule of lenity, does it or doesn't it?
MR. FISHER: I think, Justice Kennedy, a
fair way to ask yourself the question is, would the
statute here rise to the level of a plain statement of a
kind that is required to, for example, abrogate
sovereign immunity or to realign the Federal State
balance. The term "clear statement" and "clear and
definition statement" that is used in the historical
context --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How many statutes exist
like that, my goodness? You want the government to be
held in all statutes to a level that is clear enough to
satisfy the clear statement --
MR. FISHER: With all due respect, Justice
Scalia, that's what the historical cases say.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what the rule of
lenity means.
MR. FISHER: Yes. With all due respect. If
you look at the examples in Blackstone, that's the
Greenbury cite, if you look at this Court's earliest
cases, Chief Justice Marshall wrote for the court in
Wiltberger that even though it's extremely improbable
that Congress wanted the result that the defendant
presses, the Court is nevertheless going to insist on
it, because it is not unambiguously clear this was
Congress' intent.
And so, it's easy to forget given the modern
proliferation of Federal criminal statutes how rare
criminal cases used to be in this court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do our cases reflect what
you're saying? I thought our cases on the rule of
lenity say that where there is an ambiguity you give the
tie to the defendant.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think this is very
important, Justice Scalia, your cases, especially the
historical cases and the modern ones, I think, waffle in
different directions, but there are plenty of cases from
this Court that are much more than a tie-breaker in the
sense of the rule of lenity and say, we require clear
and definite terms, that's the phrase Justice
Frankfurter used to repeat. Justice Holmes said the
statute must be clear. Even up to Granderson it says --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was in a context
where the question was whether or not the conduct was
criminal at all not since.
MR. FISHER: That's right. But for the
reason --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you apply clear
statement rule to the sentencing code, I don't think we
are going to be able to get beyond the second sentence.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think with due respect
what you're going to do is actually reduce the number of
cases this court hears, because once you have a clear
statement rule, two things are going to happen. The
lower courts are going to find it more -- easier to
resolve these kinds of cases because just like in the
sovereign immunity and Federalism context, it's much
easier to look for a clear statement. And even more
importantly, Congress will know that when it legislates
in the realm of criminal sentencing, that it needs to be
clear, and it will solve this case -- this Court the
problem, perhaps, of having four or five cases on its
docket every term involving circuit splits and how to
apply mandatory minimums in the vast labyrinth of
Federal criminal sentencing provisions.
So we think this Court can rest assured, of
course, that if it rules for the Petitioner in this case
and Congress doesn't like the result, that it is well
and able and ready to step in to solve that problem.
The problem is, is that if this Court accepts broad
readings of the government, from the government of
criminal statutes, that the institutional forces that
drive legislation are -- make it much less likely that
Congress can step in to solve that problem in favor of
criminal defendants.
So for the reasons we've explained, we think
this Court should go back to the historical
understanding brought forward to the present of the
importance of the rule of lenity, and in this case find
that the statute does not clearly and unambiguously
apply to Petitioner.
If there are no further questions, I'll
submit the case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Fisher. The case is submitted.
