CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 07-1209, Peake v.
Sanders et al.
Mr. Miller.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court.
Congress has directed the Veterans Court to
take due account of the rule of prejudicial error in
reviewing administrative determinations of veterans
benefits. For four reasons, the court of appeals erred
in holding that the Veterans Court should presume the
existence of prejudice whenever it finds that the VA has
erred in providing notice to the claimant.
First, section 7261, the Veterans Court
prejudicial errors statute, is in language that is
essentially identical to that of the APA's prejudicial
error provision. And when Congress adopted that
language in 1988, it was understood to place upon the
party challenging an agency's action the burden of
showing that any error was prejudicial.
Second, a notice error of the kind at issue
here does not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say that? That
it was understood so? Because of the Attorney General's
commentary on that?
MR. MILLER: The principal reason that it
was understood is because the uniform practice in the
courts of appeals as of 1988 was to place upon
challengers to agency action the burden of showing
prejudice from the error. And the Congress was well
aware of that, and in particular the Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee was cited in the Ninth Circuit's
decision in Seine & Line Fishermen's Union.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You basically have
four cases in the courts of appeals to support that
proposition, right?
MR. MILLER: Well, Your Honor, it's
considerably more than that. And the only cases that
could even suggest any support to the contrary rule are
in the very different context of notice and comment
rulemaking under section 553.
And the reason that that's different is
really for two reasons. That is that the -- the
interest that section 553 is intended to protect is not
the interest of any particular commenter or particular
outcome of the rulemaking. It's the interest of the
public in having the agency's decisionmaking fully
informed by all of the relevant comments.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but this is --
I mean, it's kind of the -- it's the first notice.  It
gets the ball rolling. I think it's like, you know, two
teams and you don't tell one of the teams when the game
starts and then you say, well, it doesn't matter because
they would have lost anyway, there is no prejudice.
MR. MILLER: The reason that in a great many
cases there is not going to be prejudicial error of the
kind at issue here is that the VA has an informal
non-adversarial system and many opportunities to correct
the effect of any official notice error. That is
illustrated by the history of the cases. To take the
Ms. Simmons's case, for example --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to the
question that was just posed? We have never held that
every agency -- agencies come in many sizes and shapes,
but in all cases, the APA places the burden on the -- on
the petitioner. But this Court has never held that
across the board, no matter what agency we are talking
about, that's the rule.
MR. MILLER: That's correct. This Court has
not held that. But Congress was aware that the uniform
practice, certainly in agency adjudications in the
courts of appeals, was to place the burden on the
challenger, and Congress --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Was Congress aware of this
when the Administrative Procedure Act was passed, you
mean?
MR. MILLER: No, the statute at issue here
is the Veterans Judicial Review Act of 1988. So the
relevant time we are looking at what the practice was is
as of 1988 when Congress incorporated the language from
the APA and placed it into section 7261. And as of
88, it was clear that the burden was on the
challengers.
JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you to clarify
exactly what you mean by the "burden" of showing
prejudice? Is it correct that neither of the following
-- to borrow the terminology that you would use in
formal litigation, and I understand this is not formal
litigation before an agency, but to borrow that
terminology, is it correct that the issue here doesn't
concern either the burden of production or the risk of
nonpersuasion before the administrative agency? Before
the regional office? In other words, if there's -- if
there is evidence that the veteran as opposed to the VA
has to produce, that doesn't change, and whatever the
standard is that has to be met to show an entitlement to
benefits, that doesn't change either, so that all that's
involved here is whether -- whatever showing needs to be
made is to be made on appeal or on remand?
MR. MILLER: That's correct. If we are
talking about what showing needs to be made on appeal.
And as this Court suggested in O'Neal, you know, the
burden language is perhaps more appropriate for the
context where there's people presenting competing
evidentiary submissions to a factfinder and that's not
what we have here.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's in O'Neal. It says
that, but most of the court joined and the reason it
says it is it just confuses everybody, at least me, to
talk about "burden" in this context. I think if O'Neal
is right, it says what this is, is not involving a jury,
not involving -- it's just what Justice Alito says, and
following that, what you have, you say to the judge,
"Judge, your job is to decide this. Decide. Decide
whether you think that the one side -- whether there is
error or whether the error is harmless or whether it
isn't. Decide it."
Now, it could be in a rare instance the
judge just can't decide. He's in grave doubt. And so
what we are talking about is what to do in that -- what
should be a very, very rare instance.
Now, when I read this case, I thought the
Veterans Affairs is absolutely common sense on this. It
says, well, when you really don't know what to do,
Judge, if the veteran got no notice at all, then
probably the error was harmful. But if he got the basic
notice, and all that's at issue is who should produce
what or whether he thinks that he didn't know that he's
supposed to produce a lot of information, well, there,
it would be pretty rare that it was harmful. So then
you'd better say to him, veteran, why did this hurt you?
That's all common sense, and it seemed to me
that that's what the Veterans Court was saying and then
the Federal Circuit unfortunately, like I might have
done, too, got it all mixed up with this burden of proof
language. Now, you tell me, legally is that result
which I am talking about sensible, and if so, how do I
get there legally?
MR. MILLER: Justice Breyer, the reason that
we have used the language of "burden" --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not criticizing you for
that. I'm not -- it's not a criticism. I'm just really
trying to figure out to get to what I see as common
sense legally.
MR. MILLER: The point that we are trying to
emphasize is that, in the ordinary course the Veterans
Court, like any court, is going to act on the basis of
arguments that are presented to it by the parties. So
when you speak of the "burden," you mean the challenger
has the obligation, if it wants the Veterans Court to
find prejudice -- to articulate some theory of how there
was prejudice. And that --
JUSTICE BREYER: The theory is he didn't
know anything about this, got no notice whatsoever, so
he didn't know that he's supposed to produce more
information or he'll lose. That's the theory.
MR. MILLER: But in order to -- in order to
connect that error -- I mean, that's an identification
of an error under the Veterans Claims Assistance Act.
But if you connect error --
JUSTICE BREYER: But if you connect it by
saying normally a veteran who isn't that knowledgeable
-- not everybody is a genius in law -- when he doesn't
get a notice that tells him you got to produce something
more or you lose, he might forget to produce something
more. That's the theory.
MR. MILLER: If he has something more. And
what we are saying is that in order to get a remand, the
claimant, by the time they get to the Veterans Court,
has already identified the error, has made an argument
to explain to the court that there was in fact an error,
at that point they ought to explain how the error
affected them. If it prevented them from put in a piece
of evidence, they ought to tell the court, "Here's the
piece of evidence that I want to put in."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, usually, when
you have an appellate court, with a hard question, is
easily divided, the case is resolved on the basis of the
standard of review. What is the presumption, if it's a
close case? And why isn't that all sort of what we are
talking about here? It's a close case, and the judge --
the panel says, well, this side has the burden of
persuasion, so we're going to come out the other way.
MR. MILLER: Because I think in a case where
the -- like these, where plaintiff has not identified
anything that they would have done differently, it isn't
a close case with respect to the question.
Now, we have to be clear: If a claimant can
articulate something they would have done differently,
we are not saying they have the obligation of showing
that the outcome definitely would have been different or
more likely than not, it would have been different. It
would be sufficient to identify what they would have
done differently.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if what
they would have done differently is get different
medical tests, or done something like that, or have the
doctor in the prior testing who prepared the diagnosis
look at something that they didn't have them look at
before? In other words, it's not simply the absence of
documents that they know they can submit or could have
submitted. It's that type of question where nobody
knows. I mean, you don't know what would have happened
if they had the doctor look at the issue that now turns
out to be critical, but if they had gotten the right
notice they might have had time to do that.
MR. MILLER: Well, depending on the state of
the record in a particular case, that might be
sufficient to show a reasonable probability that the
outcome would have been different. But in a lot of
cases it won't be, and I think Simmons's case is a good
example of that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the government has
the obligation at the very first to tell the veteran
what the veteran must produce to substantiate the claim
and the government doesn't do that, why shouldn't it be
the responsibility of the government to say to the
court, "this is what, if we had done what we were
supposed to do, this is what we would have included in
our notice." And looking at that, the court can tell
whether there's anything the veteran might have done.
But why shouldn't the government at least have the
obligation to say what it would have done had it
complied with the statute, what it would have said
specifically in this case?
MR. MILLER: Well, I mean, how does the
government comply, to take Simmons's case as an example,
when the VA sent her the notice letter, her claim was
for an increased rating. She had a hearing loss that
had already been determined to be service-connected, but
was not sufficiently severe to be compensable, and she
said: My hearing has gotten worse and it now is
severely worse to be a compensable disability. The
notice letter that was sent to her, which is on page 43
of the joint appendix, was incorrect and simply
described the general requirements for establishing a
service connection. It didn't specifically say to make
out an increased rating claim you have to show that your
hearing has become worse.
But as soon as she got a decision from the
regional office, which is the first decisionmaker in the
VA system, she was told that the reason her claim had
been denied was because her hearing loss was not
sufficiently severe. And there's a mechanical
application of the certain number of decibels in each
ear yields a certain disability rating, and the notice
that she got from the regional office explained all of
that and cited the regulation that we produced in the
tables.
So at that point she was aware of why her
claim had been denied and what was missing, namely,
evidence that her hearing had become worse. And she had
been given at that point a series of hearing
examinations -- examinations for hearing by VA doctors
and the results of those were all reproduced in the
decision that she got. And yet, the Veterans Court
found that the government had failed to carry its burden
of showing a lack of prejudice, because we couldn't show
as a matter of law that there was no way she could
obtain --
JUSTICE BREYER: Which is fine. If I get
that record and if it is the way you describe, I'm not
in grave doubt. No problem. The record's the way you
described it, she knew everything she was supposed to
know, so there's no harmful error, okay? We are only
talking about cases where there is real doubt in the
judge's mind about whether this failure of the agency
did or did not hurt the woman or man. Now, when in
doubt, we have the Veterans Court telling us the best
way to administer this stuff is when they get no notice
at all, and you are really in doubt, judge, you don't
know if it was harmful or not, here's what you do:
Assume it was harmful. They're the ones who know. I
don't know.
MR. MILLER: With respect, Your Honor, I
don't think that's a fair description of the effect of
the rule adopted by the court below.
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose then we look at our
rule, we read the first paragraph, what this court said,
and we all held it, and therefore, we say, those are the
cases we're talking about, where you are in doubt, and
when you are in doubt, go proceed as the Veterans Court
told you in terms of who has to show what.
MR. MILLER: I think this case is a good
illustration about why that sort of grave doubt you are
describing doesn't arise in a case like this, where at
no state in the proceedings has the claimant offered
anything that they would have done any differently. If
they can't say, you know, here's what would have
happened differently, than there really isn't any doubt
what will happen on the remand, because if on the remand
if they don't do anything different then the result is
not going to be any different.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe I am not following
this as I should, but it seems to me you are suggesting
that there is no error.
MR. MILLER: No, certainly there was an
error. There was an error.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What was the error?
MR. MILLER: The error was that the initial
letter that was sent to her describing what the evidence
needed to -- that she needed to submit in order to
establish her claim, misidentified that evidence; that
it described the elements of general claim for service
connectiveness, didn't specifically explain what was
needed just an increased rating claim.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you saying that error
was not prejudicial because the earlier information she
received gave her what she needed?
MR. MILLER: The principal reason why that
error was not prejudicial is because the only way she
could have received benefits for an increased rating
claim was evidence that her hearing had become worse.
And she had a VA hearing test that said her hearing did
not meet the schedule A criteria for being compensable
damages.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why wasn't that statement
you just made sufficient to discharge the burden of
showing no prejudice?
MR. MILLER: The fact -- I -- we believe it
shouldn't, then. But under the rule as imposed by the
courts below, it clearly wasn't.
Under the decision of the Federal Circuit,
the VA has the burden of showing that there was no way
that benefits could have been awarded as a matter of
law. And that had been in effect prior to the VA
proving negative by demonstrating the non-existence of
any evidence anywhere that might have been material to
the claim.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know -- it's
easy to look back and view this in the abstract legal
terms, but we are dealing with lay people who are trying
to get something from the government, which is always a
difficult thing. And you have one notice saying you
have got to show that this was during the service, then
they get another notice or decision saying it wasn't
severe enough. Why is it so difficult, when the
government made a mistake in dealing with this layperson
who is just trying to get benefits to which they are
entitled, to say that the government has to show that it
didn't make any difference, rather than requiring the
layperson to do that?
MR. MILLER: Well, because there are two
responses. The first is that it's important to keep in
mind the stage of the proceedings which this inquiry
involved. The prejudicial inquiry is only at issue once
the claimant has reached the Veterans Court, which is an
adversary proceeding in which claimants do have counsel,
and they identified an error and they have explained to
the court: Here's what the error was. So that's the
stage in which it would be incumbent upon them to
articulate how the error might have affected them.
The other point to be made is under the rule
of the court of appeals it's going to be very, very
difficult in many cases for the government to discharge
the burden of showing there is no evidence that could
have possibly been produced. And the result is a large
number of remands.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And as between the two
courts, the court of appeals, the Veterans Court and the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, do we owe
either of them, maybe not deference in the Chevron
sense, but some deference because of their expertise in
dealing with these claims, and if that is so then do we
owe more deference to the court of appeals or the
Veterans Court?
THE WITNESS: I'm not aware that this Court
has ever --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean it's an issue of
law, so I take it it's de novo.
MR. MILLER: It's certainly that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in the exercise of
that review, don't we have to give some weight to the
determination of the Court of Appeals for Veterans
Claims that sees these claims all the time? I actually
thought that that's where you were going to start out
because you cited 7261, which says that the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Claims shall, what, give due
effect to -- take due account of the rule of prejudicial
error. And I think you could get from that that they
have a certain amount of latitude in determining what
the best rule is. But you're not going to -- you don't
tell us that?
MR. MILLER: No, and I think that by
adopting language from the APA using the same language
that applies to all kinds of judicial review of agency
actions, Congress strongly suggested that it didn't want
a unique rule for judicial review of VA determinations.
And so I think there is no reason to defer to either the
Veterans Court or the Federal Circuit on this general
question of the standard of prejudicial review.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a factual
question. You said most of these people were
represented by counsel. There used to be a rule that
they could only be paid ten dollars a case. Is that
still in effect?
MR. MILLER: When I said they were
represented by counsel, I meant in the Court of appeals
for Veterans Claims, not at the administrative --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But not during the nisi
prius proceeding.
MR. MILLER: In the administrative
proceeding the restrictions on payment of counsel have
now been relaxed at the Court of Veterans Appeals stage.
So there generally -- there is not counsel at the
regional office, but once the case reaches the board
there can be counsel.
JUSTICE STEVENS: There can be counsel. But
is it really typical?
MR. MILLER: I don't know the statistics on
that, because --
JUSTICE STEVENS: There would be a dramatic
change, because years ago I remember a case in which the
Court upheld a ten-dollar fee limit on the notion that
these people didn't need lawyers at all, which struck me
as a little strange.
MR. MILLER: In any event, that is no longer
the case at the board level, and even those claimants
who do not have counsel, the great majority of them, I
think about three-quarters at the regional office level
and 98 percent at the board level are represented by
some sort of non-attorney representative, either service
organizations like the American Legion, or many States
have organizations that assist claimants. Like Ms.
Simmons, for example, was represented by a North
Carolina State agency before the VA. So there is some
assistance to claimants there.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Miller, could you help
me out on how the system works in practice in a
different way? One of your answers a few moments ago
was that when -- I think it was Ms. Simmons was told why
she lost, she in effect got as much notice as she would
have needed to have to in effect do better on a remand.
My first question is: Is there an automatic right to a
remand?
MR. MILLER: If you are talking about after
the initial decision from the regional office, there is
not an automatic right to a remand, but there is an
automatic right to a de novo review by a more senior
official at the regional office.
JUSTICE SOUTER: With new evidence?
MR. MILLER: Yes. You can get a hearing.
You can present new evidence. It's a decision review
officer. And then if you are still dissatisfied with
the resolution after that, you can go to the board, and
you can get a hearing before the board. The board's
review is de novo.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But even on the --
on the functioning of the system as you have explained
it, at the -- at the very least the person says -- let's
assume Simmons says: Oh, now I understand and I will
get the following piece of evidence, which I didn't
realize was my responsibility.
Even on that explanation, it means that the
claimant is going to have to go through another stage in
the administrative litigation process.
So I assume that ought to count as some sort
of prejudice, and I assume it's something that, as it
were, the burden of championing the VA ought to bear
rather than the claimant.
MR. MILLER: Well, I guess to the extent
that the delay in adjudicating the claim is a kind of
prejudice, it's not a prejudice that would in any sense
be cured by a remand for further proceedings, which will
just result in further delay.
JUSTICE ALITO: If the -- I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to interrupt.
MR. MILLER: I would just add that the --
the effective date of the claim, which is the date as of
which benefits are awarded, is the date the claim was
filed, so you wouldn't be losing money when you --
except for the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you are going to
have to go through another stage of litigation. One of
the functions of the burden rule, and it might be too
subtle a function to worry much about, but one of the
functions is to puts the party with the burden on -- on
notice that if you fail in your obligation, you're the
one who is going to have to pay, unless you can convince
everybody that there was in fact no harm done by this.
And this induces the party with the burden to do what
the primary obligation says the party ought to do.
And on your -- and on your analysis, since
the government would not have that obligation, the
government has less of an inducement to follow the
statutory obligation.
MR. MILLER: But the government has a very
strong inducement to follow the statutory obligation.
Like every agency -- -
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it may have a strong
inducement, but I'm talking about a stronger one. If
the government knows that it is going to bear the burden
of any doubt about the significance of its failure, to
some extent I suppose that is going to induce the
government to be on its toes.
MR. MILLER: Well, I suppose that is right,
but I think in a lot of cases -- the VA in all cases
strives conscientiously to comply with its statutory
obligations. The notice requirements as described in
section 5103 are fairly vague. They -- the notice has
to be tailored, at least to some extent, to the nature
of the claim that's presented. And every time that the
Veterans Court or the Federal Circuit elaborates on
exactly what kind of notice is required, to the extent
that the VA wasn't aware of that elaboration before,
there are going to have to be remands in all those
pending cases.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean that's the
essential problem with common law adjudication. And
there is not much we can do about that.
MR. MILLER: But it's a problem that is
particularly acute here, given the volume of claims that
the VA has.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the experience?
When the case is remanded, it goes back to the -- does
it go back to the regional? Suppose the -- the veteran
is now given an opportunity to present whatever
additional substantiation.
MR. MILLER: The claim, when remanded from
the Court of appeals for Veterans Claims, goes back to
the board. In most instances the board would then send
it back to the regional office for further development.
If I could reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Miller.
Mr. Meade.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SIMMONS
MR. MEADE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I would like to make three points. First,
because notice is integral to the system that Congress
designed, the VA's failure to provide notice is likely
to prejudice the veteran.
Second, it would be difficult for the
veteran and comparatively easy for the government to
carry a burden. It would be difficult for the veteran
because under the government's rule the veteran would
need to engage in a speculative exercise, identifying
what evidence would have been developed had the veteran
been notified and had he received the full assistance of
the agency.
JUSTICE ALITO: Why is it a speculative
enterprise? If you are correct, and the proper
resolution in a case like this is a remand, let's say
all the way back to the regional office, and if before
the regional office it's the veteran who will need to
come forward with some evidence supporting the claim,
why does it make sense to remand the case to the
regional office if there is no possibility that when the
case gets back there the veteran can come forward with
medical evidence that's needed?
MR. MEADE: Two reasons, Justice Alito:
First, it's not clear even in the Veterans Court that
the veteran will have notice of what's required, a point
I would like to address.
But, second, if it's remanded, the process
will develop as it should have in the first place,
because under the statutory scheme there is both the VA
and the veteran, the informed veteran, who have joint
duties and together during an interactive process they
develop the evidence together. And during this
interactive process, to answer to Justice Stevens's
question, the veteran is prohibited from hiring a
lawyer. Without having the most basic notice of what's
required, the veteran cannot participate in this
process. And the only way we can know how the process
would really work would be to give the veteran the
notice that he was entitled to in the first place and
then allow the process to unfold as it should have.
JUSTICE ALITO: What if you have the
situation -- and I think actually your co-Respondent's
case illustrates this better than yours. But you have a
situation where the record as it has developed contains
some evidence that supports the veteran's position and
some evidence that supports the position in favor of
denial of benefits. The Veterans Administration all the
way up through the process finds that the evidence
contrary to the veteran's position is much stronger and
denies the claim on that basis. The veteran says: I
didn't get notice of what exactly I needed to prove.
Now, if on remand to the regional office
it's still going to be up to the veteran to come forward
with medical evidence showing hearing loss or vision --
connecting the vision loss to something that happened in
the service, why does it make sense to send it back if
there's no possibility that the veteran is going to be
able to do that when the case gets back?
MR. MEADE: Well, the answer is, first of
all, that we don't know how the process would unfold
once the veteran has notice. Even if there is evidence
in the record, we don't know what evidence would have
been developed had the veteran had proper notice.
In addition, veterans often are not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Why is that?
I'm not sure I follow you on that point. Once he's got
up to the next level and finds what the notice should
have told him, why can't he come up with it then?
MR. MEADE: Well, for a few reasons. First
of all --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You say it's a de novo,
right, at this next level?
MR. MEADE: First of all, it's unclear
whether the veteran would even have notice even at that
point. None of the other requirements that the agency's
is required to give are the same as the notice
requirement. However, if in appropriate cases they have
given the actual notice by the time it reaches the
Veterans Court, they can use that to rebut the
prejudice. And that's what the Veterans Court said in
Vasquez-Flores.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your case did your
client attend the initial hearing?
MR. MEADE: There was a medical examination
that she didn't attend. There was a question of where
the notice was sent, and this is at 70a of the
Petitioner's appendix. There was confusion.
Apparently, notice was sent to the wrong address by the
agency.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what's the first
time that your client knew that this claim was going to
be processed at a particular time or the first time your
client knew it had been denied? I just was never clear
on the fact of what happened. If the notice was lost in
the mail, so how did she know there was a hearing at
all, or did she?
MR. MEADE: She later informed the agency
that she had changed her address. But even it appears
that further notices were sent to the wrong address.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just trying to -- it
seems to me at the first hearing, if she in fact is
there, they say, well, now you have to give us some
notice. And then at that point -- or some
documentation, and at that point, at the initial
hearing, everybody knows who has to produce what.
MR. MEADE: But there is not necessarily a
hearing. It was a medical examination that was supposed
to be scheduled that she didn't attend, partly because
of confusion of where the notice was sent.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there usually an
initial hearing?
MR. MEADE: No. There's only a hearing if
the veteran requests it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.
MR. MEADE: There is no hearing unless the
veteran requests it. So here we have a situation where
the veteran did not know what she needed to provide.
She has two sets of claims, one for her left ear and one
for her right ear. Neither claim was intuitive. And
she couldn't figure out what she needed to do without he
notice --
JUSTICE BREYER: And so, why not just say
that? What's the big problem of saying, judge, and then
you say just what you said? And then the judge again
won't be in doubt any more. So there's no need for this
case because, either -- either -- either the veteran's
agency will say, look, I walked that veteran through the
process, I walked him through the process, walking him
through the process he was told everything he needed to
know, and there is no real problem here. It's just a
formality that he didn't get the notice. And if that's
true, I'm not in any doubt, unless the veteran tells me
that that's wrong, and here was something, okay?
On the other hand, we have your case. Your
case, she didn't go to the doctor. If she went to the
doctor, maybe she would have found something out.
Again, I have no doubt, there is harmful
error. So this case is a theoretical law professor's
case that is never going to come up, because there is
never any doubt. Either the VA did walk him through it
and it's no deal -- big deal, because she can't come up
with anything, or she can come up with something.
MR. MEADE: I agree that burdens only matter
in a handful of cases, but it makes sense to put the
burden on the government for a number of reasons.
JUSTICE BREYER: It certainly does because
it makes sense to tell the government: Government, you
have to come up with every possible conceivable factual
scenario and prove there wasn't a man from Mars who came
in, and -- you know, that doesn't make sense.
MR. MEADE: But that's not what we ask for
here. First of all, if the veteran actually received
notice during this dialogue that the government
describes, then the government can point to that as a
way to disprove prejudice.
Second of all, veterans are often
vulnerable. They are often unrepresented in the
Veterans Court. Under the latest statistics, 64 percent
are unrepresented at the beginning of the Veterans
Court, 24 percent at the conclusion of the Veterans
Court. Many have psychological and mental disabilities
like post-traumatic stress disorder. Twelve percent of
those who currently receive disabilities receive
benefits for PTSD.
And it's not clear -- this is not lawyers;
this is not doctors trying to receive benefits. This is
not just lay people. They are veterans who served the
country --
JUSTICE BREYER: I know all this and why
don't you just tell the judge that and say: Look at my
client, judge, look at my client. My client obviously
isn't going to understand what to do unless the client
is told. And here my client wasn't told.
I'm the judge, I'm not in any doubt, you're
going to win, okay?
So what I can't figure out is how to deal
with this case, which as I said strikes me as a law
professor's case that shouldn't make any difference in
any real situation.
MR. MEADE: The reason is that it's helpful
to have presumptions to deal with the typical case where
we have in our case a first element notice error. The
question where the veteran does not even know what
evidence he needs to put forward, in that case it makes
sense because of the high likelihood of prejudice to
have a general rule that the burden should be on the
government and not on the veteran.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No court is going to
accept as a showing of prejudice the idea that, here,
look at my client as a layperson who didn't know what to
do. That's not going to be adequate, is it?
MR. MEADE: I don't think it would be.
That's why it makes sense to have a general presumption.
In cases where the government can either show that the
process worked as it should have or that the veteran
actually received notice during the process, it can
rebut that prejudice.
In fact, in 2008 alone, the government has
been able to do so. And it has done so at least a dozen
times in a number of cases, rebutting the burden of
prejudice that was established by the Veterans Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's wrong with
Mr. Miller's response that at the very first level of
review, you can start all over; and at that point you
know precisely why your claim was denied?
MR. MEADE: Well, again, there are various
levels of review. But the notice to start that first
level of appellate review does not necessarily give the
veteran the notice that she is entitled to.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was my
question. Is it -- is it -- I take it it's more than
just a stamp saying "denied," right? There is some
explanation in every case?
MR. MEADE: Exactly. There is a statutory
requirement that a statement of reasons needs to be
provided, but the statement of reasons don't necessarily
correlate with the detailed requirements under the
notice statute. Under Vasquez-Flores what the Veterans
Court said was that the notice needs to be quite
detailed and the denial letter in a particular case
might not map on to those particular requirements.
In October of this year, Congress went
farther and said: We want these notice letters to be
even more detailed. We want to give the veterans more
notice, which shows that the Congress is concerned about
these notice letters and wants to make it clear to the
veteran what is required.
Let me answer a point that Justice Alito
raised before. We are not asking here for a presumption
of benefits. All we are asking for is a remand so that
the veteran can get notice and have the process proceed
as it was meant to in the original circumstance.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the -- the notice
can be given -- skipped entirely, as it was in Simmons
case, or notice could be given but it's defective. It
can be defective in a major way, it can leave out -- you
said Congress recently required a more detailed notice.
Do we treat all those like, as long as the notice
doesn't measure up fully to their statutory requirement,
then the veteran goes back to square one? And so, you
wouldn't make any distinction between whether the notice
was not given at all, and the case where the notice was
given, but it was incomplete?
MR. MEADE: The question of whether the
notice is okay or not, is a question for the Veterans
Court, a factual finding.
Generally, though, I would agree with you
that either no notice or incomplete notice are the same
and would trigger a first notice error. There would be
cases, I suspect, where the notice was erroneous, but
only on a technical ground, that the Veterans Court
would not think of as being a first level notice error.
One final point I would like to make, Your
Honor, is that in passing the statute Congress made it
clear that it wanted to assist all veterans, including
those whose claims did not appear meritorious on their
face, and it did so by overruling the decision in Morton
v. West in the Veterans Court.
That case has said that a veteran needs to
meet a certain minimal threshold before receiving VA's
assistance, that first the veteran needs to show that
the claim is well grounded. Congress rejected that in
passing the statute and said: Congress wants to help
all veterans, including those whose claims don't seem
meritorious on the face and including those who can't
make a threshold requirement. And Congress specifically
rejected the policy rationale of the Veterans Court and
said that they want -- Congress wants to use resources
to help all veterans, including those whose claims are
not meritorious on its face.
Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Meade.
Mr. Lippman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. LIPPMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT SANDERS
MR. LIPPMAN: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Justice Br eyer, I would like to address one
of the observations you made applying O'Neal and
Kotteakos and the "grave doubt" standard.
The problem here is that those standards
assume a fully developed record. That's why it's not a
perfect fit here because the very notice failure, the
defective notice, prevents a fully developed record.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it seems -- what I
was trying to get to, which I don't see how to quite get
there -- it seems to me that if something really went
wrong, if there -- there's no notice, that "veteran, you
have to put in some material, or you are going to
lose," if there is no notice of that, and he really
didn't get any notice during all this cooperative
process, then I think the Veteran's Court is right. At
that point I think it's fair to assume that he's hurt.
But if he got the notice -- and there'll be
a few cases where he had nothing to produce, but a lot
of them he would have had something to produce. They
know it, we don't know. The Veteran's Court knows. Now
the other three matters -- who is supposed to produce
what, and do you have general knowledge, can you produce
whatever you want -- I would think it would be very rare
that a veteran was hurt, if he knows the first, by not
knowing the second, third and fourth.
And therefore, I think he better come forth
to explain in the brief, in the brief, why this matters.
Now, that's what it seemed to me the Veterans Court set
up. They know about it. They set that up. It's common
sense. So, how do I get to a legal result that says
just that? Or can I or should I?
MR. LIPPMAN: I don't think you should, and
if my case could be used as an example --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your case is one where
the veteran did get what they call the first level
notice.
MR. LIPPMAN: Correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So Justice -- the
implication of Justice Breyer's question is that your
client would lose, because your client did get the first
level notice and you say that that's not good enough.
MR. LIPPMAN: That's correct. He did not
get the second or third level of notices; that is, what
the government said it will get and what he was required
to get.
This is the letter or part of the letter,
critical part of the letter he got. It says: "We are
making reasonable efforts to help you get private
records or evidence necessary to support your claim."
So he had every reason to assume that the -- that the VA
would get the evidence that was necessary.
JUSTICE ALITO: Why doesn't this make sense
in your case? I think this illustrates what is
troubling to me about the Federal Circuit's decision,
but maybe I am missing the point.
Your client was denied benefits for failure
to show a causal connection, to show that his vision
loss is service-related. He provided evidence from two
private ophthalmologists or optometrists providing very
weak causes of -- evidence of causation. One said it
was not inconceivable that this was the cause of it. He
was examined by two VA doctors, who said it was more
likely that this was caused by post-service infection
rather than by an explosion while he was in the service.
Now if the case -- if the notice was
defective, why does it not make sense to say to your
client, show us that you can come up with some medical
evidence that shows that this is service-related,
something more than a doctor who says it's not
inconceivable?
Then it makes sense to remand it. But if
you can't do it on appeal, what sense does it make to
remand it, where the same failure to provide evidence is
going to doom his claim?
MR. LIPPMAN: Two answers to that, Your
Honor.
The first is, the government makes the
proposition that all we need to do is offer an
explanation. But in legal terms, that is a proffer on
appeal, and that is every bit as evidential as the
actual evidence itself. Now, if we -- if we are to have
a whole practice of proffers, it opens up a Pandora's
box. I mean, where -- where do you stop if you make an
exception for extra-record evidence, when the statutes
make it clear that the evidence or whatever you are
using has to be before the agency.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why is that such a tough
thing to do? It sounds like it's sort of -- is there
some law out there that stops you from saying in the
brief in a paragraph that, we would just like you to
know, Judge, that we had some evidence here, or we have
some now that we want to present to them. That's all.
And then if I see that, I would say, my
goodness -- and you describe it in three sentences. Now
what is -- the Constitution doesn't stop you from doing
that, does it? What stops you from doing that?
MR. LIPPMAN: The statutes stop you from
doing that.
JUSTICE BREYER: They stop you, but the
Veterans Court said to do it. So -- and they are the
one who know this area and they said you should have to
do it.
MR. LIPPMAN: But with all due respect, I
think the Veterans Court got it wrong. I mean --
JUSTICE BREYER: Between me and the Veterans
Court, as to who knows best how to work this system,
it's ten to one it's not me.
MR. LIPPMAN: Okay. Let's look at it this
way. Let's take it outside the VCAA context. A veteran
has a right to a hearing, an evidentiary hearing, upon
request. Let's say he requests the hearing, and for
whatever reason the VA doesn't schedule one. He loses
that right even though he requests it. Are we then now
to have proffers on the court of appeals saying, well, I
would have said this, I would have said this, I would
have said --
JUSTICE BREYER: What they decided there is
if there's no notice at all, no, you don't have to have
a proffer, because it's up to the agency to do just what
you want. But if it's one of these other three, far
more technical things, which occur far more rarely, on
that one, you better tell the judge in the brief how it
makes a difference.
That's their conclusion. What's wrong with
that?
MR. LIPPMAN: Well, there -- there is
certainly no analysis to it. I mean, it's sort of an
intuitive distinction and in my case, it doesn't work.
And I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the -- the statute
says, and this is consistent with Justice Breyer's line
of questioning, that the Veterans Court, the Court of
Appeals, the Veterans Court of Appeals, shall give due
account to the notice -- to the rule of prejudicial
error. That seems to me to indicate that it has some
discretion in how to decide the harmless error rules
that it will apply, and that it knows more about it, in
Justice Breyer's term, than either we or the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Why can't I get that
out of this statute?
MR. LIPPMAN: Well, I guess you would have
to reconcile the more specific statute that deals with
only able to submit evidence or any other material at
the time -- at the of the agency's adjudication. In
other words, I don't see that statute allowing
post-agency adjudication proffers or even submitting
evidence. I mean, just by the very line of your
questioning, it seems to me that you find it
interchangeable whether you assert it in your brief that
this is what I would have done or whether you would have
submitted the evidence itself. They are both
evidential. And another problem, which is really --
JUSTICE ALITO: Your position seems to be
not that the government should have to show prejudice,
but as applied to a case like yours, that there is an
irrebuttal presumption of prejudice. What could the
government show? They would have to show that there is
not a single ophthalmologist in the country who, if he
or she examined Mr. Sanders, would find that the vision
loss was attributable to a bazooka explosion in World
War II?
MR. LIPPMAN: No, Your Honor. The -- what
the government must show is well set forth in the
Federal Circuit's opinion. It must show that the
claimant had either actual knowledge of what he needed
to submit; second, that he had some constructive
knowledge, in other words a reasonable claimant would
have had notice; or three, that the claim couldn't
entitled to benefits as a matter of law.
So that's the beauty --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- but I don't understand
that. I mean, let's suppose, contrary to your wishes,
that the client was not hurt. He was hurt by some other
thing, nothing to do with the bazooka. That's not your
client -- that's the imaginary client -- but everything
else is the same.
Well, does that mean because they forgot to
tell the client that the client has to go and produce
some evidence, and she thought the Veterans
Administration would produce all the evidence? Because
they forgot that, your client wins and gets the money?
MR. LIPPMAN: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't seem --
MR. LIPPMAN: -- he wouldn't get the money,
okay? Because all -- we are talking about a remand, not
a --
JUSTICE BREYER: I know. Now you are going
to be back in the remand and you now have to produce
some evidence, don't you, or you lose?
MR. LIPPMAN: Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: So then why is it a big
deal that you summarize what you're going to produce in
the brief? We're back where we started.
MR. LIPPMAN: Let me answer it this way.
Let's assume we do make proffers, as you suggest, at the
Veterans --
JUSTICE BREYER: I might have called them a
proffer. I just want to say it's a description in the
brief of how you're hurt.
MR. LIPPMAN: Well, in the legal sense I
consider it the same thing. Maybe Your Honors don't,
but I do. And -- let -- let's say he proffers or
describes in his brief what medical evidence he needs to
submit.
How could he in good faith make a proffer
and speculate on what the doctor -- let's say he is
seeing a treating doctor. And on page 49 in the
footnote, there is a discussion of what I'm going to
explain to you now. But let's say he alleges, well, if
I had gotten notice, I would have gone to my treating
doctor, and I would have submitted questions and I would
have submitted the claims file, but I can't know in good
faith what the doctor would say. It's inherently
speculative. And that's one good policy reason, apart
from the clear categorical language of the statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You started earlier,
at one point, to say how this actually worked out in
your case. Could you just spend a minute to explain
that?
MR. LIPPMAN: How --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How it makes a
difference in your case.
MR. LIPPMAN: Sure. It was a little unclear
until a case -- if I may answer it this way, Your Honor.
My -- the Board of Veterans Appeals decided
there was only one medical evidence it would follow, and
that was the 2000 VA exam. And that exam really denied
the veteran because there was no corroborating medical
evidence contemporary with his injury and the
symptomology thereafter. If I could have it go back
down, what I would do is try to find what we call "buddy
statements," lay statements, that would corroborate that
he had symptoms from time of service and well on, which
under a case called Buchanan is sufficient evidence to
base a finding of service connection.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why wasn't that
enough for you to establish prejudice, regardless of who
had the burden?
MR. LIPPMAN: To make that allegation at the
court of appeal that I would have gotten this?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Uh-hmm.
MR. LIPPMAN: Quite frankly, I don't know if
I would have gotten it.  I mean, I would try.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you would
phrase the prejudice in terms of what you would have
done and what you weren't able to do, and which you can
now go back and do if it's remanded. You don't have to
have the evidence that three people would say he was
complaining about the vision loss at the time. It just
seems a reasonable thing to -- you know, maybe it is
reasonable, maybe it's not; but the Veterans
Administration has more knowledge about that.
MR. LIPPMAN: Your Honor, in a way, the
third prong of the Federal Circuit's analysis does that.
It tells the government: Look, if the veteran could not
prove his claim, no matter what the facts -- evidentiary
development was, then the veteran loses.
So really it's all contained in the third
prong. And that's why the Federal Circuit's analysis in
my opinion is so good. It's because it doesn't make you
go outside of the record to reach these issues, and it
allows the government a lot of room to prove that it's
not worthwhile, this claim's not worthwhile to, remand.
I ask the Court to really carefully look at
that because I know the Federal Circuit spent -- must
have spent a lot of time in coming up with that
analysis.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know where this
first level, second level -- I'm looking at the statute
on page 98a of the petition. And it seems to me all
part of one. It is one notice? It doesn't seem to
specify a second and a third. It's describing the
contents.
MR. LIPPMAN: Well --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: "As part of that notice,
the Secretary shall indicate which portion of the
information and evidence is to be provided by the
claimant and which portion by the Secretary." The
statute seems to be talking about one notice, not "first
level," "second level."
MR. LIPPMAN: Well, they haven't enumerated
it, Your Honor, as such. But analytically it breaks
down to that. But the fourth element, because it says,
look, you'll have to tell the claimant what the
contents, what you need. Then it says, well, what we
are going to get for you, and then that's the second.
And third one is what you have to get.
The fourth one was engrafted upon it because
in the regs 3.159 has a more generalized advisement, in
addition to this --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that was taken
out, the fourth one. No?
MR. LIPPMAN: Not to my knowledge, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And tell me what that is.
It's not in the statute?
MR. LIPPMAN: No, it's in 3.159. I don't
recall the exact -- it's 38 C.F.R. 3.159. I don't
recall offhand the exact subdivision, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it just tells that
the Secretary requests the claimant provide any evidence
in the claimant's possession that pertains to the claim.
MR. LIPPMAN: Right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's fairly
straightforward.
MR. LIPPMAN: It's not as important as the
first, second, and third elements of the statute, for
sure, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. LIPPMAN: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Miller, you have
four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MILLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I would like to make just three points.
First, on the question of what is provided to the
claimant after the denial in the regional office.
Before they get to the Board of Veterans Appeals, the
regional office issued them a statement of the case, and
that's described at 38 C.F.R. 19.29, and that regulation
has fairly detailed requirements about what has to be in
there in terms of a description of the evidence, the
description of the applicable laws and regulations and
analysis of the board's conclusions, or the regional
office's conclusions and its application of the law to
the evidence.
The second point --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it's
perfectly clear from that what gaps need to be filled
MR. MILLER: In many cases, it would be.
But perhaps there would be some where it wouldn't, and
of course in those cases if there can be some
articulation of why it wasn't then we would agree --
JUSTICE SOUTER: At that point is the
claimant disentitled to have a lawyer?
MR. MILLER: No. Once they file the notice
of disagreement in the regional office and receive the
statement of the case, they could then have a lawyer in
the board.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But at the point they get
the notice and they are trying to evaluate the
significance of the notice, they are not entitled to a
lawyer?
MR. MILLER: If you are referring to the
statement of the case, by the time they receive the
statement of the case they are at the stage of the
proceedings where they could get a lawyer.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what about the notice,
the original notice? They don't have a lawyer at that
point? That was Justice Souter's question. I didn't --
MR. MILLER: Oh, if you meant the original
notice required by the statute. No.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No -- at the point where
the statute requires original notice, they are not
entitled to a lawyer.
MR. MILLER: Correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: We agree on that. Now,
they have gone through stage one of the litigation and
they have lost. And they are getting a statement of
reasons. At that point, are they entitled to have a
lawyer?
MR. MILLER: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But whether -- I guess the
situation that I am concerned with is, the person up to
that moment not only does not have, but is not entitled
to have a lawyer. The person then gets a piece of paper
in the mail that says, "You lost. These are the
reasons." If the person -- if the claimant then says,
"I don't know what they are talking about. I will go
get a lawyer," then I can understand at that point a
relatively sophisticated mind is going to come in to
understand it. But if the client simply reads it and
says, "I really don't know what they are talking about
here or at least I think I know what they are talking
about, and I guess it's hopeless," the person is not
likely to have legal advice.
And what I'm getting at is that the person
at that stage, at the moment the notice arrives, is in a
position, I would think, of extreme relative
disadvantage.
MR. MILLER: I think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You can see where I am
going with the argument.
MR. MILLER: Yes. The important point is
that the only way the prejudicial error becomes an issue
and really the paradigmatic case that we are talking
about is where the veteran does get counsel and has
reached the Veterans Court and has identified the error
in a way that's persuasive to the Veterans Court, but
nonetheless identifies no additional evidence that they
would have --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it seems to me that
there are two points at which the veteran is at a
disadvantage. And you are talking about the second of
the two. I am talking about the first of the two. And
the first of the two is the point at which the -- I
mean, following the hearing, the veteran gets the notice
and the veteran is not in a very sophisticated position
to evaluate what the veteran is being told.
MR. MILLER: Yes, and a claimant who in the
Veterans Court can say, you know, "I didn't understand
and as a result I failed to present the -- because of
the defective notice and my lack of understanding of the
statement of the case, I didn't present this important
piece of evidence, and here's how it would have been
material," in that case, they would be entitled to a
remand. But a remand --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you have been
saying "entitled to a lawyer," do you mean entitled to a
lawyer or allowed to have a lawyer?
MR. MILLER: Allowed to retain counsel.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish
your --
MR. MILLER: I was just going to say that,
given the volume of cases that the VA confronts, there
is a serious harm to the system in unnecessary remands
that have to be given priority over other cases and that
divert resources from the adjudication of meritorious
claims.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the
