CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
this morning in case 06-856, LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg &
Associates.
Mr. Stris.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STRIS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Let me begin with the first question on
which this Court has granted certiorari. Sections
2(a)(2) and 409 of ERISA permit restoration of "any
losses to the plan."
JUSTICE SCALIA: What are the code numbers
of those? I really get confused with you people who
work with ERISA all the time -- can refer, you know
Section 3 of ERISA. I use the code. What -- what code
sections are you talking about?
MR. STRIS: I never thought the day would
come, Justice Scalia, when I was described as working
with ERISA all of the time, but I will tell you the code
provision. The code provision is -- for 502(a)(2) of
ERISA -- is 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(2). It's found on page
a of the blue brief. Section 409 of ERISA is 29
U.S.C. 1109, and I was quoting specifically from
09(a), and that is found on page 9a of the blue brief.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you.
MR. STRIS: Now, the statute plainly states
that "any losses to the plan" may be recovered if they
were caused by fiduciary breach. Our position on the
(a)(2) question is straightforward. The plain meaning
of "any losses to the plan" includes any diminution in
value of defined contribution plan assets, regardless of
the number of participants ultimately affected.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the plan itself
is nowhere in the record, is that right?
MR. STRIS: Well, the summary plan
description was attached to the complaint.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, the summary.
And I looked at the summary and saw nowhere the rules
about investment options, what you get to choose, how
often -- and for all we know, the plan might say you
have no choice about investment options, it's all going
to be invested in T-bills or whatever.
MR. STRIS: Respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice,
that's not true. I would point your attention to page
a of the appendix to the brief in opposition. And
this is the page of the summary plan description that
makes clear that participants in the plan like Mr. LaRue
will have the opportunity to direct their investments.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that wasn't in the
record.
MR. STRIS: It is in the record.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It is in the record.
MR. STRIS: Yes. And to be clear, Justice
Scalia --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where in the record
is it?
MR. STRIS: It is page 19a of the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's in the
opposition to certiorari, and I don't believe that's in
the record.
MR. STRIS: It is in the record; it was
attached to the complaint that was filed by Mr. LaRue in
this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, that's the
summary of the plan.
MR. STRIS: The summary plan description,
that's correct. And as you know, Mr. Chief Justice, if
there is a conflict between the summary plan description
and the plan, the summary plan description governs; it's
a legitimate document.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The summary on the
page you mentioned says that you will be able to -- you
have certain investment choices are available to you,
and that the administrator will provide you with
information on what they are and how you can change it.
MR. STRIS: That is correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we don't know
those details, correct?
MR. STRIS: That's true, but this case was
decided at the pleading stage. And so to be clear, we
alleged that the right given to Mr. LaRue under the plan
was violated. If true, then that would constitute a
fiduciary breach.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would also
presumably more obviously constitute a breach of the
plan, correct?
MR. STRIS: Yes, that's correct; and that is
a fiduciary breach. Under 404 (a)(1)(D), failure to act
in accordance with the terms of the plan is a classic
example of breach of fiduciary duty.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your position is
anything that is remediable, if that's a word, under
(a)(1) can also be pursued under (a)(2)?
MR. STRIS: No, that is not my position. My
position --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me step back.
Do you agree that you could bring an action under (a)(1)
for this breach of the plan?
MR. STRIS: I think that's far from clear,
but what is clear is that we could not recover what we
wanted under (a)(1). (a)(1) only permits a lawsuit
against the plan. Here the plan doesn't have the funds
that are relevant.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does it say that
(a)(1) is available only against the plan?
MR. STRIS: The specific language of (a)(1)
doesn't state that. It states that you can get benefits
due under the plan, or you can enforce your rights under
the plan. I'm not aware of a single case, Justice
Ginsburg, where an (a)(1)(B) action has been permitted
to recover personally from a fiduciary. That is the
purpose of (a)(2), which specifically states that you
can personally recover from a fiduciary.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine, so why doesn't
he proceed first under (a)(1)(B), against the plan?
MR. STRIS: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Because the plan owes him
this money. And if the plan turns around and says well,
you know the fiduciary didn't invest your funds the way
it was supposed to, the plan still owes him the money,
doesn't it?
MR. STRIS: I think the answer to that -- I
think there are two reasons why that's incorrect. And
the first reason is 502 (a)(2), unlike 502(a)(3), is not
a catchall provision, so if he has a remedy under
2(a)(2) --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about
(a)(1)(B).
MR. STRIS: Right. And it is -- there is
nothing to suggest that that provision is mutually
exclusive with another provision. So my first response
to your question, Justice Scalia, is that even if he
could have proceeded under (a)(1)(B), there is nothing
to suggest that he had to, if he wanted to proceed under
the express terms of (a)(2).
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there is -- there is
this to suggest that only -- only that manner of
proceeding preserves the structure of -- of the
legislation which is that you're supposed to first apply
to the plan and exhaust your remedies there before you
come into court; and interpreting it that way would
preserve that -- that exhaustion requirement. You have
to apply to the plan first, and if you establish that
the plan owes you money, then it's a loss to the plan
and you can sue in court.
MR. STRIS: Well, what I would say to that,
Justice Scalia, and is that this administrative
exhaustion requirement that you're referring to is a
judicial gloss on the statute. I find it hard to
believe that the express terms of (a)(2), which the
plain language authorizes restoration to the plan of any
losses to the plan for any breach of duty --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your approach, if
can you go under (a)(2) -- you're right that we
judicially have developed a number of glosses on (a)(1),
including I think most importantly the Firestone
deference principle. But if you're right that you can
go under (a)(2), then all of that work has been in vain.
You can avoid all the limitations on (a)(1) just by
saying we want the same relief under (a)(2).
MR. STRIS: I would not agree with that
characterization because there are very few cases where
the specific conditions for (a)(2) are met. You would
need to prove a loss to the plan. In welfare plan
cases, for example, you would not be able to proceed
under (a)(2) because you would never be able to show
that the fiduciary breach caused a loss to the plan.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You told me earlier
that any breach of the plan was a fiduciary duty.
MR. STRIS: That's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now you're -- the --
what is it -- the obverse or the converse of that you're
saying is not true.
MR. STRIS: No, that's not true. There are
two requirements for an (a)(2) action. One is that
there be a fiduciary breach. That's what you just spoke
to when you referred to a breach of the term of the
plan. But there's a second important requirement which
goes to the heart of why (a)(2) is what it is. There
must be a loss to the plan. This Court recognizes --
JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you whether the
(a)(2) argument would be available to you on remand even
if we agree with your interpretation of that provision?
Didn't Judge Wilkinson say pretty clearly that the
argument had been waived? He said, "even if the
argument were not therefore waived." Doesn't that mean
that it was waived?
MR. STRIS: I don't read the Fourth
Circuit's decision that way. I read it as -- as dicta,
not an alternative holding. And to be clear, the
Respondents concede that point on page 5 of their brief
in opposition, and I quote. They state: "After
suggesting this claim may have been waived" and then
they proceed. So even Respondent agrees that it was
merely dicta --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe -- maybe they've
waived the waiver, but Judge Wilkinson is a careful
writer, and if you use the subjunctive there -- "even if
the argument were not therefore waived" -- doesn't that
mean it was in fact waived?
MR. STRIS: Not in my opinion, but that's an
issue that the Fourth Circuit and the lower courts will
need to resolve. If they interpret their opinion as
having held that, certainly we would be precluded. I
don't think that that is what they held, and I think we
have a very strong argument that we pled a 502(a)(2)
claim as required under the Federal rules.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me come back to your
earlier point that the second requirement of (a)(2) --
it's actually a requirement of 1109 --
MR. STRIS: That's correct. Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is not met. And that is
-- that is to -- to make good to such plan any losses to
the plan resulting from each such breach. In these
welfare plans, if you sue the plan, claiming some
welfare benefits that haven't been provided, wouldn't
the plan have to provide those benefits?
MR. STRIS: Yes. That is a classic action
under (a)(1)(B), Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that would be a loss to
the plan.
MR. STRIS: No. I don't agree with that
characterization. In a defined benefit plan of which a
welfare plan is the classic example --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. STRIS: -- there are no assets that you
have an entitlement to as a beneficiary.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I have an entitlement to
certain -- certain welfare payments.
MR. STRIS: That's -- you have entitlement
to a contractually provided benefit. So, if there is a
fiduciary breach in terms of the administrator stating,
"We're not going to give you this cancer treatment that
really was provided under plan" --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. STRIS: Or, "we're not going to give you
this drug" --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. STRIS: -- that breach doesn't cause any
diminution in value in plan assets.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It does if you sue the plan
and require the plan to pay what the plan has committed
to pay, whereupon the plan would have a right of action
against the fiduciary, I assume, for the fiduciary's
failure to do what he was supposed to.
MR. STRIS: Well, that may be true, but with
respect, I think that that is -- that's the tail wagging
the dog. The argument that you made is that a loss
occurs if your fiduciary duty claim is successful.
That's another statute. That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that would
preserve the necessity of going through the exhaustion
requirement first. You apply to the plan and say the
plan owes me this cancer treatment, and the plan says
"yes, we do" or "no, we don't." If it says "yes, we
do," it's liable to you and then the plan can -- can
recover over against the trustee.
MR. STRIS: Let me take a step back because
I think we are 100 percent in agreement, but I want to
be clear what our position is. Under the factual
scenario that you described, I agree with you 100
percent that you would need to proceed under (a)(1)(B),
because you would be requesting a benefit that you are
entitled to under the plan.
In this case, the only benefit that you are
entitled to, if you are a participant in an individual
account plan, is the value of the contributions that
you've put or your employer has put into the account, as
they have either appreciated or depreciated. So my
first response -- it's actually the second response I
was going to give earlier that I never got to is that I
believe that it's not clear that there is even a
legitimate (a)(1)(B) claim that Mr. LaRue could have
asserted here because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it isn't just if the
money is payable to him today. It says, "to enforce his
rights under the terms or to clarify his rights to
future benefits under the terms of the plan."
MR. STRIS: That is correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And if there's no money in
his account, it seems to me he could bring an action to
clarify that even if there is no money in his account
the plan owes him future benefits in that amount.
MR. STRIS: And then one of two things at
that point would happen, Justice Scalia. Either he
would get paid by the plan, which would pick the pockets
of the other participants and require the plan to then
bring an action under (a)(2) --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. STRIS: -- which is perfectly
legitimate, but my response to that is there is no
language in the statute to suggest that that is
required. If he has an action to do that directly under
(a)(2), there's no language in the statute to suggest
that he need bring an (a)(1) action first and require
the plan to then proceed under (a)(2).
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I'm not sure
about your characterization that he would pick the
pockets of the other plan participants. By definition
he only prevails if this was a benefit to which he was
entitled under the plan. So that doesn't seem unfair to
the other plan participants.
MR. STRIS: Well, a defined contribution
plan is nothing more than a collection of assets that
have been allocated to a group of participants. So, if
those assets are depleted through fiduciary breach,
which is what occurred here, and you bring a claim
saying that your interest in the plan was depleted, if
you brought that claim against the plan, the plan no
longer has the money. So either they can pay you --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it may or may
not have the money. You could have failed to follow his
instructions in a way that enriched the plan, and it's
simply a question of getting that money properly
allocated rather than improperly allocated to the other
plan participants who are picking the pocket of your
client.
MR. STRIS: Well, I think under the example
that you just gave, Mr. Chief Justice, there would not
be a loss to the plan.
Our fundamental argument about the plain
text of this statute is that a loss to the plan is a
diminution in plan assets. If I'm a participant in a
plan, and the administrator doesn't like me and takes my
money and allocates it, just because they feel like it,
to another participant in the plan, it is not our
position that there would be a claim under (a)(2)
because there has been no diminution in plan assets.
One would need to proceed under (a)(3).
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the plan wouldn't
necessarily pay out any money. What would happen is,
after the administrative determination by the plan that
it does owe the money, he would sue the plan for the
money and the plan would implead the trustee who was
responsible for this. It ends up the same way.
MR. STRIS: Well, I would say two things
about that. First, it may end up the same way depending
on how the facts play out, which is the perfect evidence
for my point, which is 502(a)(3) of ERISA has been
interpreted as a catchall provision. 502(a)(2) is
anything but. It sets forth very specific conditions
and very specific relief that is available if those
conditions are met. There is nothing to suggest that
the availability of a potential remedy under (a)(1)
precludes a remedy under (a)(2).
Now, my second response, Justice Scalia, is
that depending on how the facts play out, the result may
not be as you suggest. The plan may choose not to go
after the fiduciary, and if that's the case, all -- at
most my client could get is a declaration under (a)(1)
that doesn't ultimately get him any money.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What would happen if the
trustee does not have the money? The trustee not only
squandered your client's money; he squandered his own.
He's just really in bad shape. He has no money to cough
up. What happens to your client? Doesn't your client
get that money from the plan anyway?
MR. STRIS: I think that that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: By picking, as you put it,
by picking the pockets of the other plan participants?
MR. STRIS: I think in an individual account
plan, that presents a very difficult question.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the answer to it?
MR. STRIS: I think probably he would not be
able to recover that money. I think that money would be
lost and he would have no remedy because, at that point
in time, someone is going to lose. Either my client is
not going to recover money that he is entitled to or
other participants in the plan are going to have money
taken away from them.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They participated in the
plan. It was a failure of the trustee for the plan. It
seems to me the whole plan should be liable for it. I
mean that's how I --
MR. STRIS: I don't think there's any
evidence for that. ERISA imposes a duty of loyalty to
all plan participants. If they breach a fiduciary duty
which causes a diminution in plan assets that ultimately
will affect only one participant, there is -- it goes
against the very core of ERISA to say that they can
remedy that by taking money from innocent fellow
participants. And that really goes to the core of the
difference between an (a)(2) claim and an (a)(3) claim
on one hand, and an (a)(1) claim on the other hand.
One thing is clear here. Whether or not
Mr. LaRue could have brought an (a)(1)(B) claim, it
would not under any circumstances have resulted in
getting money from the fiduciary back into the plan.
Absent money being returned to the plan, there can be no
meaningful remedy for the breach that occurred.
So it returns us to the core question in
this case, which is were the terms of (a)(2) satisfied?
Now, the court of appeals basically advanced
two arguments as to why the plain text of the statute
should be ignored. The primary argument was a
fundamental misinterpretation of this Court's opinion in
Russell. So I'd like to speak about that.
JUSTICE ALITO: If we agree to you on
(a)(2), is there any need to get to (a)(3)?
MR. STRIS: Certainly if you agree with us
on (a)(2), the court of appeals can be reversed on that
issue. We ask that you also reach the (a)(3) question,
because this case was decided at the pleading stage.
Although it may be unlikely, there are two
reasons why we might need to avail ourselves of (a)(3)
on remand. The first is that facts could develop. I
don't have any reason to believe they will, but facts
could develop where there is a loss to Mr. LaRue's
beneficial interest but not a loss to the plan. In
other words, they took his money and they gave it to
someone else.
We should be able to plead, if we have a
cognizable claim under two statutes, both of them and
then discover the relevant facts.
The second reason why you should reach the
(a)(3) question is additional relief may be available
under (a)(3) that is not available under (a)(2).
JUSTICE ALITO: What would that be?
MR. STRIS: Well, our theory of surcharge,
and it's also the government's theory, is that surcharge
is a make-whole remedy for pecuniary losses that are
caused by a breach of trust. It is clear that the core
losses are diminution in trust assets or failure of
trust assets to appreciate. But there are individual
pecuniary losses that were historically remediable under
surcharge.
For example, if you paid out of pocket for
an auditor to figure out what the extent of a fiduciary
breach was, a premerger court of equity would not only
surcharge your harm, the harm to your interest in the
trust, but they also would return to you the money that
you spent for that audit.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your own
argument was that (a)(3) is the catchall. So if (a)(2),
which is described as very precise, if that's
applicable, you would not get to (a)(3). You would be
asking us at this point to assume that somehow the
(a)(2) case folds, and then we flip over into (a)(3).
But why should we get there prematurely? It
seems to me if it's right that (a)(2) comes before
(a)(3), it isn't -- it's not quite a ripeness issue, but
it's close to that.
MR. STRIS: Well, the Court certainly may
choose not to reach the (a)(3) issue, so I can't speak
to that. But what I can say is that the dicta in Varity
that describes (a)(3) as a catchall provision -- it is
clear that at the end of the day if the release is
coterminous under the two provisions, it would not be
appropriate for us to proceed under (a)(3).
But that is not a pleading question. My
position as to why you should reach (a)(3) is if we have
a cognizable theory under (a)(2) and (a)(3), and we
believe we do, we shouldn't be required to choose at
this point in time if, as the litigation proceeds, it
turns out that the relief we would be entitled to is
coterminous, then we concede it would not be appropriate
to proceed under (a)(3).
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Stris.
Mr. Roberts.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
ERISA authorizes a participant in a defined
contribution plan to sue to recover losses to the plan
caused by a fiduciary breach even if the losses are
attributable to the participant's individual plan
account.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that means every
participant, right? In other words, for the failure of
the plan to follow this individual's instructions, any
participant in the plan can bring suit under (a)(2)?
MR. ROBERTS: It's -- that's theoretically
possible because the loss to the -- loss to this
individual account is a loss to the plan. Although it's
unlikely that a participant that has no -- that is --
whose own benefits are not going to be affected has much
incentive to sue, and it's also possible that a court
might conclude if such a participant did bring suit,
that such a suit shouldn't proceed under prudential
standing principles or because the suit wouldn't be
appropriate, but here --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't the theory be that
if ultimately the other accounts could be robbed to sort
of make up for at least part of the loss of this one,
that for a loss to any account is a threat to all the
others?
MR. ROBERTS: Well, we agree that a loss to
any account is a threat to the plan as a whole, but I
think for a different reason. We don't think that you
could rob the other accounts to pay this -- this
participant. That would likely violate the fiduciary's
duty of loyalty to those participants, the fiduciary
duty of prudence under -- under ERISA.
It would also probably violate the terms of
the plan, because they have a right to future benefits
by the amount that's in their allocation but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Roberts, Section (a),
(a)(1)(B) --
MR. ROBERTS: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Unlike Section (a)(2),
which refers you to 1109, does not say who gets sued.
Under 1109 it's clear who gets sued. It's the fiduciary
who gets sued. I find it very curious that (a)(1)(B)
just says a civil action may be brought to recover
benefits due to him under the terms of his plans or to
clarify his right under the terms of the plan.
MR. ROBERTS: Yes, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think the implication
there is that the suit -- the suit is against the plan.
MR. ROBERTS: The implication is that the
suit is against the plan or against a fiduciary in --
under (a)(1)(B). Against the plan or against the
fiduciary whose initial capacity is representative of
the plan.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where?
MR. ROBERTS: If you can't sue the fiduciary
under (a)(1)(B), that just reinforces the point even --
even more, Your Honor, that Petitioner's cause of action
here arises under (a)(2) because he is seeking relief
for the plan not relief from the plan.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It may well. But I'm just
talking right now of (a)(1)(B), and it would seem to me
that the logical reading of that is that the suit is
against the plan.
MR. ROBERTS: Under (a)(1)(B), most courts
require that the suit be brought against the plan. I
think the suit in certain circumstances could be brought
against the fiduciary to require the fiduciary to take
action that is required by the terms of the plan such as
if you fought against the fiduciary to pay benefits out.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we know that
this is a breach of fiduciary duty under (a)(2) without
having the plan before us? In other words, it may not
be a fiduciary obligation to follow an instruction from
somebody if the plan provides a different way in which
those instructions are going to be handled.
I'd say, as I think a lot of these plans do,
you can change your investment options only during a
particular period. Well, if the instruction came at a
different time, it wouldn't be a breach of fiduciary
duties because it wasn't a breach of the plan.
MR. ROBERTS: And if it's not a breach of
fiduciary duties, Petitioner will lose on the merits or
on remand in their motion for summary judgment based on
facts that could be decided.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought his
argument -- his argument reduces to the fact that it's a
breach of fiduciary duty because it's a breach of the
plan. But if not a breach of the plan, then it's not a
breach --
MR. ROBERTS: It's a breach of fiduciary
duty both of a failure to follow the terms of the plan
and a breach of the duty of prudence, because when a
plan provides that participants can direct their
investments --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we need to know
-- we need to know what the plan provides before we can
decide.
MR. ROBERTS: The case was dismissed on the
pleadings, Your Honor, and it alleges that there was a
breach of fiduciary duty. And Respondent hasn't
disputed, in fact, that the plan requires
participants -- allows participants direct, in fact --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The pleadings don't
include the plan. So we have to assess the pleadings
without the terms of the plan.
MR. ROBERTS: Yes, but the inferences
shouldn't be construed against the plaintiff in motion
to dismiss on the pleadings, Your Honor.
In addition to that, Respondent's answer --
this is on page 2a of the red brief -- admitted that
participants in the DeWolff plan are permitted to direct
the investment of their contributions to the plan.
That's in paragraph eight on page 2a.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we don't know
under what terms. I mean I've seen plans where you are
entitled to direct, but that's subject to conditions and
limitations.
MR. ROBERTS: That's certainly true, Your
Honor. But here, the court of appeals assumed that
there was a fiduciary breach. That's on page 3a in the
star footnote of the -- it's the appendix to the
petition for certiorari. There is no reason for this
Court to second-guess that, particularly since
Respondent didn't argue in its motion to dismiss that
there was no fiduciary breach here. So the case comes
to the Court on the assumption that there is a fiduciary
breach. And these are very important questions
concerning whether assuming there is a fiduciary breach,
a participant in a defined contribution plan can sue to
recover for the plan the losses to the plan that are
caused by that breach when the losses are attributable
only to that individual's account.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, would you
clarify what the government's position is on this
(a)(1)(B) argument? Are you saying it is available, but
(a)(2) is available?
MR. ROBERTS: We don't think that there is a
claim at this point under (a)(1)(B), because the -- the
money the Petitioner seeks -- what's happened here is he
has alleged that there has been a fiduciary breach that
caused a loss to the plan. The appropriate remedy for
that is a recovery from the fiduciary in its personal
capacity to put the money back in the plan. That's what
section 502(a)(2) provides. Once the money is back in
the plan and then it's allocated pursuant to the duty of
prudence to the Petitioner's account, then if the plan
didn't pay out the money to him when he was entitled to
it, which he appears to be entitled to it now since he
has withdrawn his account balance, he would have a 502
(a)(2) claim -- a 502(a)(1)(B) claim, excuse me -- but
he doesn't have a claim under that provision now. We --
at least we think it's very unlikely that he does,
because generally plans provide that the benefits that
are owed to people are the money that are in -- in the
account.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, now we know what
benefits would be due because he has withdrawn, but when
he made this complaint and he hadn't been withdrawn, he
--
could have made an unwise investment the next time. And
MR. ROBERTS: That's right, and then he
would -- it would be even clearer, I think that he has
no (a)(1)(B) claim, if he didn't have -- say he was
still participating in the plan and he wasn't -- he
hadn't withdrawn his account balance and didn't have a
right to withdraw his account balance at that time, then
he wouldn't have a right to any benefits from the plan.
The crux of the matter here is that the plan
has suffered a loss and that the appropriate remedy is
against the fiduciary in his personal capacity;
(a)(1)(B) doesn't provide for suits against the
fiduciary in his personal capacity to recover money for
the plan. It provides, again, suits against the plan to
pay money out of the plan. This money isn't in the
plan; it can't paid from the accounts of other
participants because it would breach these duties under
ERISA. The appropriate remedy is to get the money back
in the plan.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that if
it is within (a)(1)(B) that it's therefore not within
(a)(2)?
MR. ROBERTS: No, because (a)(1)(B) provides
an action for benefits from the plan and (a)(2) provides
an action against -- it's a different -- against a
different defendant for a different kind of claim.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought your
answer would be yes. In other words, if it's in (a)(1),
it's not in (a)(2).
MR. ROBERTS: If it's a claim for benefits
under (a)(1) or to enforce the terms of the plan, such
as if the fiduciary says, "I'm just not going to follow
your instruction," and the participant wants a
clarification of that and an order compelling the
fiduciary in his official capacity to do that, yes, that
would be a suit under (a)(1)(B) and there would be no
suit under (a)(2).
There's only a suit under (a)(2) if there
are losses to the plan and if the remedy is to put the
money back in the plan by getting it from the breaching
fiduciary.
If I could turn to (a)(3) just very briefly,
Your Honor. We think that suits against fiduciaries to
recover losses by fiduciary breaches are also authorized
by section 502(a)(3), which provides for appropriate
action, I believe.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that 1132 we are talking
about?
MR. ROBERTS: Yes, that's 1132(a)(3).
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of the United States Code.
MR. ROBERTS: Of the United States Code, 29
U.S.C. 1132.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's useful to have a code.
It really is.
MR. ROBERTS: Okay. I apologize. That --
that provision -- my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your
sentence.
MR. ROBERTS: That provision provides for
appropriate equitable relief, and a suit against a
fiduciary to recover losses caused by a breach of
fiduciary duty seeks equitable relief because it's
analogous to an action for breach of trust seeking the
equitable remedy of surcharge.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Roberts.
Mr. Gies.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS P. GIES
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. GIES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Petitioner in our view suggests an awkward
reading of Section 409, one that is particularly hard to
reconcile with the structure of the civil enforcement
provisions of Section %02, 1132 of the U.S. Code,
starting of course with Section (a)(1)(B).
To us this is the opposite end of the
spectrum of the kind of case the Court was talking about
in Russell and what Russell has been assumed to have
been meant --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Russell was about a
welfare plan, not a pension -- and as I recall, the
plaintiff in Russell was seeking medical benefits that
she didn't get and she wanted, not the benefits because
she did get those, she wanted straight out damages,
compensatory and punitive damages, for delay in the
receipt of benefits. That's quite a different thing
from saying I want the contributions made so that I will
get the benefits to which I'm entitled.
MR. GIES: You're right, Your Honor, that
that is certainly distinguishable on the facts. We
think the central teaching of Russell, though, applies
with equal force to a defined contribution case like
this, for several reasons.
The first of which is that Russell has been
assumed to reflect the dicing that we are talking about
which provision in Section 502 is appropriate.
Individual claims have traditionally been brought either
under (a)(1)(B) or under (a)(3). When a claim is being
brought on behalf of the plan as a whole, Russell
teaches and -- and helps define when those claims are
available. It is an odd case here, where the plan is a
defendant, to at the same time assert that this claim is
being brought on behalf of the plan.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that is an oddity but
what do you say to Mr. Roberts' argument that the only
recovery under (a)(1)(B) is against the plan, and the
plan doesn't have the money in the account so that if
there is going to be any relief it's got to come from
the fiduciary and that gets you into (2).
MR. GIES: Well, because neither (a)(2) or
(a)(1)(B) were invoked in the district court and the
case comes up on a very spares record, it's hard to --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but we've got to
assume at this point that we've -- we've got a -- a
Section (2) claim before us and the argument simply is,
is that in effect to be disallowed because it should
have been an (a)(1)(B) claim? And the argument that the
United States has made, the argument that the other side
has made is, we cannot get to any money under (a)(1)(B).
We've got to get that from the fiduciary and we can only
do that under (2).
MR. GIES: The difference between defined
contribution plans and defined benefit plans in ERISA is
an important consideration in answering that question.
(a)(1)(B), the first clause, speaks of recovering
benefits due to him. As you know from our briefs we
argue this is a case for lost profits, not benefits,
certainly not vested benefits in the way the Court used
the term in Firestone.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So then you would agree
that (a)(1)(B) is not available?
MR. GIES: No, Your Honor. We believe that
(a)(1)(B) definitely was available for the Petitioner
here. What relief he might have recovered under
(a)(1)(B) had he invoked that provision remains to --
would have remained to have been seen had it been
invoked. There are three --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the argument of the
United States is you can't rob Peter to pay Paul, so
that if in fact his account didn't have the money, the
plan didn't have any place to get the money, and the
only way the money could be had would have been from a
fiduciary, which again gets you to subsection (2).
MR. GIES: It would only get you into
subsection (2) if it could be argued that that claim was
for the benefit of the plan as a whole, as this Court
has taught in Russell; and it seems to me, Your Honor,
that one way to think about this in terms of which
provision applies to which of these claims, is whether
Congress really intended for these individual kinds of
"he said; she said" claims to be brought. We think not.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But it seems to me
you're answering a different question in that response.
The argument here is basically an argument between the
possibility -- an argument based on the claim that under
(a)(1)(B) you can't go against the fiduciary. The only
way you can get the money is from a fiduciary and
therefore (a)(1)(B) would have been of no value to you.
Do you -- do you take issue with that premise?
MR. GIES: Well we think -- no. No, Your
Honor. In general we do not take issue with that
premise.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, then doesn't that
leave you in the position of having to say that you've
either got to bring the claim under (a)(1)(B), or you've
got -- subsection (2) -- or you've got to bring it under
subsection (3)?
MR. GIES: We think not for this reason.
The second clause of (a)(1)(B) permits a cause of action
to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan. This
is a case that if you give the Petitioner full benefit
of the doubt probably could have been resolved with a
telephone call. (a)(1)(B) permits an action to enforce
his rights under the terms of the plan.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And the answer, if the
premise you have just agreed to is correct, will be,
"you bet. He is entitled to have another $150,000 in
his account for the benefit of future payments to him."
MR. GIES: Well, we think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: "But we haven't got the
money and we can't rob Peter to pay Paul and therefore
we are very sorry, go away." That would necessarily be
the answer.
MR. GIES: Well, we think not with respect,
Justice Souter, for this reason. Keep in mind the
theory here is one for lost appreciation in the account.
This plan does not have pooled assets.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's going to the --
it seems to -- with respect, I think that's going to the
merits. And the question is, if you can recover against
anybody, the claim is, the argument is you're going to
get nowhere under (a)(1)(B) because the plan can't help
you by itself. The only way you can get any value from
your lawsuit is by going against the fiduciary. Maybe
you have good reasons to defend that, but if you're
going to have a suit against anyone, it's got to be
under subsection (2).
MR. GIES: I think the answer to that,
Justice Souter, is that it reflects how careful and
interrelated these provisions in 502 are.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And they're saying they are
careful and interrelated provisions mean that you got to
go under subsection (2).
MR. GIES: To which we say --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And you're I think saying,
we -- we agree with you that ultimately (1)(B) couldn't
get you any relief because the fiduciary -- the plan
doesn't have any money. And you're now arguing, well,
if you go against the fiduciary, ultimately we have a
good defense to that. But the fact is, the question
before us is whom do you sue and under what -- under
what section? And I think your own logic forces you to
say that -- that has got to be subsection (2).
MR. GIES: Well, one more answer to your
question about (a)(1)(B), Justice Souter, is this: As
you know, ERISA is a statute that provides for limited
remedies, and the question of what remedies might be
available under (a)(1) and whether or not this defendant
would be solvent or somebody else would have to be
impleaded in our view need not be decided in this case.
We think it's sufficient to identify that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it hasn't been
reached yet, has it?
MR. GIES: -- as another remedy that could
have been pursued here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If there is a suit
under (a)(1)(B) for a breach of the plan by a fiduciary,
do you agree that the plan, if it's liable, could then
sue the fiduciary? I realize I'm talking about a suit
by one of your clients against the other, but would that
be a feasible result under the statute?
MR. GIES: Yes, it is, and it's also
possible depending on the facts. And again, from this
sparse record, it's hard to know that there could be an
action filed against whoever it was who is alleged to
have made the mistake. One of the issues, of course, in
this case is it's not clear who made the mistake or
whether or not the mistake was in fact a breach of
fiduciary duty.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it entirely clear that
the plan itself does not have any money to pay this off
unless it takes the money from other individual
accounts? I thought one of the briefs said that -- that
some plans have independent funds. I forget what
sources they came from, but some slush fund that they
could use for this purpose.
MR. GIES: What you're talking about I
think, Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't called a slush
fund. I know that.
(Laughter.)
MR. GIES: -- was a plan that provides for
pool of assets. This plan does not. And so the answer
to your question is no, there is no other place to get
the money from, which we think is another reason why
this is not on appropriate claim under (a)(2). It is
not losses to the plan in the conventional way we
understand those words. But the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what is the plan
other than a collection of individual -- I mean the
trustee is the trustee for the plan. All of the assets
are there. The individuals do not have them in their
pockets. So the trustee is managing this fund, which is
then segmented into accounts for each individual. So I
think your -- your suggestion is that these defined
contribution plans, they come out entirely because --
because of the segmented accounts. So you could never
bring a claim because it would always be an individual.
MR. GIES: Well, we think that (a)(2),
properly read, does not permit an individual claim.
(a)(3) permits a claim for equitable relief, and
(a)(1)(B) would permit a claim for benefits for the
other two.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? Why? That's
the question, it seems to me, in the case. Why? I mean
-- imaginary example -- a plan, a thousand members. The
trustee invests in a thousand diamonds. He puts it in a
bank deposit vault. One day he takes all 500 diamonds
and runs off to Martinique. We catch him enjoying the
sun. We can sue him under (2), right? That's what (2)
is there for, right? Right. Okay. Now, everything is
the same except each of the thousand diamonds was put in
individual safe deposit box with the participant's name
on it. Everything else is the same. Why should it
matter?
MR. GIES: We think relief in that
situation, including recovery of the diamonds and any
profits associated with it, would be available under
(a)(3).
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm sorry. I'm not
interested in that question. I'm interested in my
question. Why isn't it available under (a)(2)? In both
cases, the trustee took 500 diamonds that belonged to
the plan and went to Martinique. Now, if you can sue
him when the plans are all put in one big safe deposit
box with the diamonds, why can't you sue him when
they're put in 500 small safe deposit boxes?
MR. GIES: I think the structure of defined
contribution plans makes that a little inapt of an
analogy, with respect, Justice Breyer. In this plan, as
we know, the assets are not pooled. It is, of course,
the sum and total of the individual plan accounts, but
the question of legal ownership is different from the
question of whether or not in this case it ought to be
read as losses to the plan. Here it is by definition
the most individual kind of claim that anybody could
think about. It is a run of the mill, as alleged claim
between an investor and a stockbroker essentially that
the stockbroker did not execute the trade.
JUSTICE ALITO: But do you dispute that
there was not -- that there was a loss to the plan in
the literal sense?
MR. GIES: Yes, we do. For --
JUSTICE ALITO: If --
MR. GIES: For two reasons, first of all,
there was no distribution until after he cashed out and,
second, the nature of this claim, again, is for lost
profits. It is not for benefits as in the sense of a
defined benefit plan.
JUSTICE ALITO: But if you accept the truth
of his allegations, wouldn't the plan have greater
assets than it had?
MR. GIES: No. Because there's no way to
imagine that anybody made out on this. This is a case
where the investment instruction was not followed.
There's no way to imagine that my clients made any money
on that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're arguing that
ultimately he couldn't prove damages. We're talking
about allegations at the pleading stage.
Let me ask you a slightly different
question. You said there's no -- there's no, as Justice
Scalia put it, there's no slush fund; there's no pooled
assets here. All the assets are assets which are
accounted for, attributable to, individual accounts.
Therefore there can be no -- there can be no loss to the
plan which is not a loss to an individual account, can
there be?
MR. GIES: Yes, sir. That's correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is your theory on
how we determine whether a loss to the plan from an
individual account suffices as a loss to the plan for
purposes of pleading? Has it got to be, you know, 500
losses out of 1000? I don't see why that should make a
difference. I'm going back to Justice Breyer's
question.
MR. GIES: Yes, I don't think the actual
number makes any difference, but I think the nature of
the allegation, the type of fiduciary breach, does.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but why doesn't the --
MR. GIES: In the "stock drop" cases --
JUSTICE SOUTER: There's something I'm not
understanding about your argument. When you say the
nature of the fiduciary breach pleaded is what makes the
difference, I am understanding you to be answering the
question whether on the merits ultimately there will be
a -- they will be able to make out a claim. And I am
saying, as I said once before, that that seems to me a
question that comes after you answer the question before
us. And the question before us is not whether
ultimately you've stated a winning claim, but whether
ultimately -- whether right now you have stated a claim
for a loss to the plan.
Now, that is not your view. Why is it that
I am taking your answer to be an answer on the merits to
a different question and you're saying my answer, i.e.,
nature of duty breached or -- is one that goes to the
question of pleading at this stage?
MR. GIES: Because of the words "losses to
the plan" in the text, the words on the page, in the
context of the rest of 502. The words "losses to the
plan" connotes something collective. The example --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you said -- you
said it doesn't have to be every single member of the
plan.
MR. GIES: That is correct, Justice
Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said it has to be
more than one. How then do we read the statute to say,
well, it doesn't have to be the plan as a whole because
there may be some people that are not entitled to this?
How do we get that number between more than one and less
than everybody?
MR. GIES: I would -- I don't think that
that's a useful way to think about it either, Justice
Ginsburg, which is why I think the right way to think
about it in the context of this statute is to think
about the nature of the allegation at the pleading
stage. In the stock drop cases, the fiduciary breach
alleged is an imprudent investment in holding company
stock. I think the diamond analogy is closer to that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm -- I'm asking you
just -- in your -- you have said, you conceded, that to
bring the suit against the trustee, it doesn't have to
involve every member, every contributor to this defined
contribution plan. But it has to involve --
MR. GIES: I think that's too harsh a rule.
--
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- more than one. So
that's the question I'd like to you address. You
recognize that there can be a claim against the
fiduciary for breach of trust on behalf of contributors
to the plan? So in that lawsuit, how many people would
there have to be to qualify? You say not everybody, but
more than one.
MR. GIES: Well, as we've argued we think it
ought to be a substantial subset reflecting the nature
of the breach alleged. That is, something systemic,
something that affects the interests of the plan as a
whole rather than just --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: For example.
MR. GIES: -- one individual plan
participant. For example, the choice of an imprudent
investment, Your Honor, where -- and that's where most
of these stock drop cases come -- they involve company
stock held in 401(k) plans, and the allegation is that
it is imprudent to continue to hold the shares of the
stock.
JUSTICE SOUTER: If you do that in two
accounts is that enough?
MR. GIES: It -- it very well might be. Two
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why not one?
MR. GIES: Because --
JUSTICE SOUTER: If it -- if it is the --
and I still don't get this, but if it is the nature of
the particular dereliction in duty that counts, why do
we need more than one?
MR. GIES: Because the nature of the
dereliction of duty here is the most -- hard to conceive
of a more individualistic kind of a breach. This is
just one dispute, one he said/she said between a
participant and the -- -
JUSTICE SOUTER: It's an individualistic
kind of breach when it is viewed as -- as only one
account, but it is a breach against the plan when it is
understood that there is nothing to the plan except an
aggregation of accounts. You can't have a breach
against one without a breach against the plan.
MR. GIES: To which we would say, Justice
Souter, that it's qualitatively different to breach a
duty as alleged here on an individual basis, on a
one-transaction basis, in one account --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why, if that is your
answer, why does it matter what the nature of the
dereliction is? Because you're -- you're saying the --
the really important question is the nature of the
dereliction. If it is, then I don't see why the
multiple of the number of accounts affected has anything
to do with it.
MR. GIES: Well, I suppose you could
imagine, Justice Souter, a fact pattern where there was
evidence -- not in this case, of course -- that there
was a pattern, a systemic failure to handle properly
investment requests made by --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And then you've got a lot
of plaintiffs but what difference does it make?
MR. GIES: Well we think that comes closer
to what -- how we read Russell and how Russell has been
understood.
JUSTICE SOUTER: That may be close to the
way you read it, but why is your reading correct? Why
should that make any difference?
MR. GIES: Because in context with the rest
of 502, 502(a)(2) has been understood, and we think for
good reason, not to apply to an individual case. There
are other remedies available, in (a)(1)(B) --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What? What other
remedies?
MR. GIES: In (a)(1)(B), and in (a)(3) for
equitable relief.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said this isn't
-- you said it isn't a claim for benefits. It's a clam
for lost profits. You said that a few times. I thought
(a)(1)(B) is a claim for benefits, current or future.
MR. GIES: The third part of (a)(1)(B)
permits a participant to sue to enforce his rights under
the terms of the plan.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Which will -- which will
get him nothing.
MR. GIES: It might have got him the trade
made, maybe a few days late.
JUSTICE BREYER: I want to go back to amend
my example. He only took one diamond. It was a big
vault he took it from -- one diamond. You still have
the claim, right?
MR. GIES: And -- and is that a --
JUSTICE BREYER: It's a big vault. He took
it from one big safe deposit box -- one diamond.
MR. GIES: And -- and is it identified in
one account?
JUSTICE BREYER: No, this is just there in
the big vault.
MR. GIES: Well, that's -- that's a
fundamental difference.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, of course. Well--
no, no. I'm going to, of course, ask you, since you
seem to be turning this thing on how individualized this
loss was, well, it was just one diamond, out of
thousand.
Now obviously I'm going to ask you, because
I haven't yet heard the answer -- at least I didn't seem
to hear it -- what the difference is whether that one
diamond came from a big vault or from one little safe
deposit box with the participant's label on it.
MR. GIES: It's still the same kind of loss,
obviously. You're correct, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly, the same kind of
loss. And what we have here is the footnote that was
alleged in -- written in the opinion -- we assume the
defendant's conduct amounted to a breach of fiduciary
duties. So therefore all of the discussion you have,
that maybe it didn't -- well, maybe you're right. But
we better send it back so that they can decide that
question. And I just don't see what the other
difference is. It can't be a difference in the size of
the diamond. And people are saying, well, why -- well,
you see the question.
MR. GIES: I do indeed, Justice Breyer. I
think the structure of the plan bears something on the
right answer because this plan does not have pooled
assets accounts, there is no way that this alleged loss
could have had any impact on any other plan participant,
nor could any recovery here benefit the plan as a whole.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask a question about
your individual point? What if the individual's account
was 60 percent of the assets of the total plan? Because
different accounts are of different sizes. Would you
give the same answer to that?
MR. GIES: I'd give the same answer, Justice
Stevens, in a situation like this with what I call the
classic one-off, he said/she said request to make a
brokerage trade.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it was 90 percent,
you'd give the same answer?
MR. GIES: I could imagine a situation where
the percentage gets so high that the assets might be
held in such a way that they could be more easily seen
to be a loss to the plan as a whole. For example, in
some of these plans there's a --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So just one individual, as
far as we know it's a very small percentage of the
total. That's the whole case as I understand it.
MR. GIES: That -- that's correct, Justice
Stevens. I think it probably depends in your
hypothetical on the nature of the asset. If it's mutual
fund shares, as in this plan held by individuals, I
don't think it would make any difference. Some plans
hold assets in common. This one does not.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You know I could understand
your case if you said even if there were a hundred
diamonds, each of them in an individual plan, there
still is no loss to the plan until the plan itself has
been held liable to make up for the loss. Up until that
point, it's just a loss in each of the individual
accounts.
But you're not willing to say that. You say
at some ineffable point it becomes a loss to the plan.
I think there is a clear line between -- between saying
there is no loss to the plan unless -- unless the plan
is first adjudicated to be liable; then there is a loss
to the plan.
MR. GIES: Well, we certainly --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Prior to that it's just a
loss to the individual account. That makes some sense.
I mean, I can understand how that works. I can't
understand how your system works. You're telling me it
depends on how big the diamond is and -- and what kind
of a breach it was. How can we write an opinion like
that?
(Laughter.)
MR. GIES: I'm fortunate to have that not as
my job, Justice Scalia.
(Laughter.)
MR. GIES: But I think -- I think it's
clearly right as this discussion indicates that the
right place to begin here is with (a)(1)(B). If you
have a claim like this, you look at the statute, it
comes first. It has the benefit of being first on the
page.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know, because in making
this, hitching your wagon to the (a)(1)(B) -- I thought
you were arguing -- what did you say the remedy for this
person would be? Assuming it's true that he put in his
slip and he said invest in X set of mutual funds and the
trustee missed it, lost it?
MR. GIES: Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is his remedy?
MR. GIES: That's a very difficult question
to answer because this is a defined contribution plan
and not a defined benefit plan and this is a claim for
lost profits. It's not an easy claim for lost benefits.
Now that's why the second clause of (a)(1)(B), to
enforce his rights under the plan, we think is the best
part of (a)(1)(B) that this individual could pursue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that what you argue in
your brief?
MR. GIES: We did not, but our amici did.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what did you argue is
his remedy, in your brief?
MR. GIES: What we argue in our brief and
what we still say is that he could have pursued
equitable relief under (a)(3).
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would that be?
MR. GIES: He could have picked up the
telephone and called and said, like I think most of us
would, say I asked you to sell my sells of stock and it
hasn't happened yet. And --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: He didn't know until he
got the report.
MR. GIES: Well, that's not so clear from
the record, Justice Ginsburg, but in any case what
equitable relief under (a)(3), just as (a)(1)(B) would
permit him, is to get an injunction to force the trade
to be executed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's much too late.
It's over and done. It wasn't made.
MR. GIES: It may or may not be much too
late, Justice Ginsburg, which we think is another reason
why as to (a)(2), we think it's unlikely that Congress
intended every one of these he said/she said cases to
give rise to a cause of action for damages. There would
be no end to the kinds of claims that one could imagine.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's take, because this
case was tossed out on the pleadings, the -- there are
forms to fill out and says I want this set of
investments as opposed to that set of investments. The
contributor fills out that form, gives it to the
fiduciary. A careless employee for the fiduciary loses
it, and that's the story. So what's the remedy for the
contributor who gave his instruction that weren't
followed, not out of anything deliberate but just
carelessness?
MR. GIES: Well, certainly injunctive relief
under (a)(3) would have been available.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Enjoining him to be
careless?
MR. GIES: Enjoining him to execute the
trade was clearly a remedy available. And perhaps there
would have been a remedy --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you say I want these
funds invested in this particular set of shares for this
period, for this six-month period, then two years later
you can have that trade made? I don't understand it.
MR. GIES: Well, we think the fact that it
took him so long to sue is another reflection of the
fact that this is a claim for damages. Had he really
intended the trade to have been made, the normal thing
to have done would be to call up and say my trade wasn't
made, please make it. And if that he didn't get an
adequate response, you'd bring an action for an
injunction.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's done meanwhile? He
came in right at the bottom and a week later, it had
gone up 30 points.
MR. GIES: And we think the Congress --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- no remedy?
MR. GIES: We think that Congress did not
want those kinds of claims to be brought under (a)(2)
precisely for that kind of reason. There would be no
end to the kind of arguments about damages. And those
kind of cases impose costs that will ultimately be borne
by the plans, which is inconsistent with the
congressional purpose in ERISA to encourage plan
formation.
So this statute on this kind of a situation
may provide him some remedies but maybe not a complete
remedy for loss of all the profits that he claims he was
denied.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You view it as a
lost profits claim. Would your position be different if
he directed a sale of the stock and then the stock went
down 30 points instead of going up? That's not lost
profits. That's avoiding losses to the plan.
MR. GIES: We think we have a different
situation indeed if there actually had been a
distribution here and the amount of the account had gone
down between the alleged mistake and the distribution.
There is clear as a claim for benefits under (a)(1)(B),
and there I think quite easily the Court could say that
in that situation the full value of the account at the
time of the alleged mistake would be benefits under the
terms of the plan. And we think that's a material
distinction between this case and others, including the
case called Glories v. Charles Schwabb that comes out of
the Ninth Circuit.
Now with respect to (a)(3), we think that
the equitable relief is properly understood not to
include compensatory damages and that this Court's
decisions have been clear on that. As to surcharge, it
would seem to me that the one -- the best that one could
say is that it was the exception and not the rule and
not typically available in the course of equity as this
Court has understood --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And never available in a
court of law.
MR. GIES: And never available in a court of
law. You're exactly right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then what is it?
It's got to be something.
MR. GIES: Well, I think what it was, as I
understand the history of the equity jurisprudence, is
that you could only sue the trustee in the equity
courts. And so if you needed to get money and if it was
a damages claim, that was the only place where you could
bring the action.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: This isn't like a
cleanup.
MR. GIES: It is not, Your Honor. As we
understand the argument on surcharge, it is separate
from clean up and we understand that and accept that.
But it still sounds more like damages. It sounds
something very different from what Congress, we think,
meant when they wrote the language of 502.
Unlike the Landrum Griffin Act, which
permits actions for damages, ERISA does not, and Landrum
Griffin was one of the statutes on which ERISA was
based.
It also has fiduciary duty obligations. It
also has the interests of beneficiaries, members of
labor unions at heart. And unlike this provision in
ERISA, the Landrum Griffin act explicitly permits an
action for damages. And we think that's further
evidence of the fact that appropriate equitable relief
in a situation like this under (a)(3) does not include a
claim like this for compensatory damages.
If there are no further questions, thank you
very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Gies.
