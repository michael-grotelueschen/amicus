CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

Financial Services.
Mr. Schnapper.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHNAPPER: Thank you.
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The court of appeals erred in holding that
the plaintiff had to have direct evidence in order to
obtain the specific instruction at issue in this case.
This Court's decision in Desert Palace makes
two important points that are relevant today. First,
the Court noted that this Court had at no time imposed a
direct evidence requirement without an affirmative
directive from Congress to do so. Secondly, the Court
noted that Congress, when it wished to impose heightened
standards, had done --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That -- that
statement may be wrong depending upon how you read Price
Waterhouse, might it not? The first statement, that
we've never imposed such a requirement. I mean, if you
think Justice O'Connor's opinion was the determinative
opinion in Price Waterhouse, then -- then we had.
MR. SCHNAPPER: That -- that's true, Your
Honor. That was not the view of the Court in Desert
Palace. Desert Palace may have misspoken in that
regard.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It was dictum. They may
have been wrong.
MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, we -- we'd like to
think they are right. I mean, we think they are right.
But of course, as you say, that is, in a sense, one of
the questions before us.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- I just want
-- you said that the Court has never imposed a burden of
proof-shifting requirement absent a directive from
Congress? Are you --
MR. SCHNAPPER: No. I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or maybe -- maybe I
misheard.
MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I may have misspoken,
Your Honor. What the Court said was that this Court had
never imposed a direct evidence requirement --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.
MR. SCHNAPPER: -- in the absence of an
affirmative directive from Congress.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is some
disagreement among the parties, of course, what "direct
evidence" means, whether it means direct as opposed to
circumstantial, or direct in the terms that for example
Judge Collatin put it in the decision below.
MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, there is not a
difference between the parties. We take no position on
that. There is a considerable variety of views about --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are telling
us we never required direct evidence, but you are not
taking a position on what direct evidence is?
MR. SCHNAPPER: The --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, you may be
right or you may be wrong. But we kind of have to know
what we're dealing with.
MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, the Court hasn't put
those two things together in the way you did. I think
that's fair. The Court's statement in Desert Palace
didn't define direct evidence. It's not -- it's not
clear in that sense exactly what the Court meant. I
think it's fair to say it certainly meant that the Court
hadn't required direct evidence in the sense of
non-circumstantial evidence, but --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in your
petition, you asked -- you used the phrase "direct
evidence," and I just want to know in what sense you
mean that?
MR. SCHNAPPER: We -- it's our view that no
special evidence is required to get the instruction in
this case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a variety of
views among the circuits on what Justice O'Connor meant
by the term "direct evidence"? It wasn't defined in
Price Waterhouse either.
MR. SCHNAPPER: No, it was not, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So there is a range of
views on what it means, starting from direct versus
circumstantial, to something like strong evidence.
MR. SCHNAPPER: There is a range of views on
that, but our view is the burden on the plaintiff is to
show by a preponderance of the evidence that in this
case age was a motivating factor, but it's not required
to show it by any particular kind of evidence or to show
it by strong evidence as opposed to merely evidence
sufficient to establish that by a preponderance of the
evidence.
JUSTICE ALITO: Price Waterhouse was a bench
trial.
MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO: And Mt. Healthy was a bench
trial, wasn't it?
MR. SCHNAPPER: I believe so, yes.
JUSTICE ALITO: Now, would the -- if there
is a direct evidence requirement, it may arguably cause
a great deal of problem when the trial judge has to give
an instruction to the jury, because then the -- the jury
will first have to decide whether a particular type of
evidence is present in the case before it can tell
what -- who has the burden of proof and what the
standard is, but if Price Waterhouse is understood
simply as a way for a judge conducting a bench trial to
look at the evidence, does it present any of the
problems that have been identified with the Price
Waterhouse -- that interpretation of Price Waterhouse as
applied to jury trials?
MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it wouldn't present
the same -- there are special problems applying it to
jury trials. We think that the requirement of direct
evidence is simply wrong for a number of reasons. At
the least, the Court would have to finally resolve what
direct evidence means in this particular context.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it's just an
instruction to a judge conducting a bench trial, it
could mean that if the judge sitting as the trier of
fact finds that there is direct evidence, strong
evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim, then the
judge will need to have strong evidence, stronger
evidence on the other side in order to rule against the
plaintiff. It's not hard to figure out how it might
work out in that situation.
The problem comes when it has to be posed in
the form of a jury instruction.
MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it's a particularly
serious problem there, but if you were to announce this
as a rule, you would -- I think the time has come to
explain definitively what "direct evidence" means. The
courts of appeals are in wide disagreement about that,
and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it was the view of
only one justice, Justice O'Connor alone. She did make
the fifth vote, but no one else accepted a direct
evidence test.
MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, she made the
sixth vote. There were five members of the Court other
than Justice O'Connor who agreed in the result in that
case. The plurality expressly rejected a direct
evidence requirement. Justice White --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, would you urge that
we should count Justice white's decision as the
controlling decision rather than Justice O'Connor's?
MR. SCHNAPPER: To the extent that you were
disposed to resolve this case based an interpretation of
Price Waterhouse. But it's our view that the subsequent
decision, unanimous decision in Desert Palace, makes it
unnecessary. Desert Palace indicates that heightened
proof requirements that -- those are the words of the
opinion. It suggest they should not be imposed by the
courts absent a statutory directive.
JUSTICE ALITO: But Desert Palace was a
Title VII case, wasn't it, under the 1991 amendment to
Title VII?
MR. SCHNAPPER: It was. But that part of
the reasoning of the case is not based on the language
of Title VII other than the absence from Title VII of
that specific language. The structure of the opinion
first talks about the definition of "demonstrate" in
section 701(n). That's obviously not relevant to the
ADEA. But it goes on to say that the absence in Title
VII of any heightened proof requirement also weighs
heavily against the Court's inferring, and that part of
the reasoning isn't limited to Title VII.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your position,
you rest heavily on the argument, I think, but there is
no textual support in the ADEA for a heightened evidence
requirement in order to shift the burden of proof. But
isn't it true there is no textural support for shifting
the burden of proof at all? I mean, I don't see how
you can -- can convince us of the first proposition
without confronting the second.
MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, this Court has on a
number of occasions allocated the burden of proof among
the parties, including to a defendant, without a
specific textual basis. The Court did so, for example,
in Burlington Industries v. Eller, where the Court's
opinion places on the defendant the burden of
establishing an affirmative defense in certain types of
sexual harassment cases. There wasn't a textual basis
for that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course,
affirmative defenses, usually the burden of persuasion
is on the party asserting the affirmative defense.
MR. SCHNAPPER: In Justice -- in the case of
Price Waterhouse, Justice White characterized this
allocation as the burden, as an affirmative defense.
But this sort of thing routinely with regard to the
allocation of burdens. It does not happen routinely
with regard to heightened evidence requirement.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it the only issue
that you have raised before us is whether the evidence
that does raise a burden on the defendant's part has got
to be, whatever this means, direct or not? That's the
only issue?
MR. SCHNAPPER: That's the only issue before
the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Am I right that the only
source of argument for the proposition that it does have
to be direct evidence is Justice O'Connor's opinion,
separate opinion?
MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, that has been the
primary basis for the argument in the courts below. I
think Respondent has other arguments as well.
JUSTICE SOUTER: There are arguments about
the need for substantial evidence. But the argument for
direct evidence goes back to the separate O'Connor --
O'Connor opinion.
MR. SCHNAPPER: That's certainly the origin.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And are you -- I mean,
we're going to hear about this. Are you going to make
an argument to the effect that that should not be
regarded as the controlling opinion, and if that is the
source of it, that is the end of the issue. Are you
going to get into that?
MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I would be happy -- I
would be happy to get into it, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I think you should.
MR. SCHNAPPER: As -- as Justice Ginsburg
pointed out, there are -- there were actually six
members of the Court in Price Waterhouse who concurred
in the result. Four members of the Court in the
plurality expressly rejected a direct evidence
requirement and said there were no limit on the type of
evidence that could be used.
Justice White said that the plaintiff's
burden was to show that in that case gender was a
substantial factor. He didn't say substantial evidence
was required.
JUSTICE SOUTER: As I understand the White
opinion, it had nothing to do with the character of the
evidence. It had to do with the degree of
persuasiveness of the evidence; is that correct?
MR. SCHNAPPER: With due respect, no, Your
Honor. It had to do --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I don't understand
what "substantial" means. What do you think he meant by
that?
MR. SCHNAPPER: The "substantial factor" was
somewhere on the scale of a very unimportant factor or a
very, very important factor, which is separate from how
clear the evidence was that it was a small or large
factor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In your response to
Justice Souter's question you said you're only focusing
on the direct evidence threshold. But if direct
evidence is the threshold to give you the benefit of
shifting the burden of persuasion of the employer, is it
really fair for you to be able to say, we are only going
to take out one side of the behalf, we are going to
leave the other side of the balance there? It seems to
me that it's artificial to separate the two
requirements, the two aspects of the Price Waterhouse
inquiry.
MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the -- the Price
Waterhouse plurality and Justice White didn't see two
aspects. The requirement was proof by a preponderance
of the evidence that in the case gender was a motivating
factor, and for five members of the Court that was
sufficient. There wasn't -- there wasn't something else
that went with it. There was for Justice O'Connor, but
she's the sixth vote. And -- and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand the
difficulty of figuring out who is controlling in -- in
Price Waterhouse. But at least as it has been applied,
my understanding -- I understand it has been applied in
different ways. My understanding of what people mean
when they say "the Price Waterhouse approach," which is
that there is a higher showing of evidence, direct
evidence, whatever -- people don't agree on what that
means. But if you meet that showing, then the burden of
persuasion shifts to the employer on the issue of
causation.
MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, that is
precisely the issue on which the lower courts have been
divided. Some courts have expressly rejected that view
and have taken the view that there is no special
heightened standard of any kind. Other courts think
that it is required. That is what we are -- what --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Schnapper, there
is a difference -- and I think it's critical to your
case -- between what is called the prima facia case that
the plaintiff would make under the McDonnell Douglas
test and proving by a preponderance of the evidence that
in this case age discrimination was a motivating factor.
I think you must concede that in order to fit within
this double motive frame you must show not simply a
prima facia case, but by a preponderance of the evidence
that the discriminatory factor was a motivating factor.
MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. We -- we are obligated
to do that, and the -- the defendant has argued below
and would, I think, on remand still be in a position to
argue that we didn't have enough evidence to meet that
burden. But that question isn't before us.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can -- can one know if
you've met that burden before the case goes to the jury?
That is, when -- when the case starts out, it's unknown
whether you have established by a preponderance of the
evidence that age discrimination was a motivating
factor.
MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, whether there is
sufficient evidence is often tested by a motion for
summary judgment. So courts do look at that matter,
that issue, before trial. What -- what isn't knowable
before trial -- and -- and frankly is often known only
to the jury -- is whether the jury will conclude that
the defendant acted with two motives or one motive.
That -- that isn't something you would normally be able
to -- to resolve before the case went to trial or even
during the course of the trial.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, correct me if I am
wrong. I assume that in a jury case that simply was
left to the jury, and the instructions would be
something like this: If you find that the plaintiff has
shown that age was a motivating factor, then you look to
the next question. And that is: Has the defendant
shown that he would have fired the plaintiff anyway?
Isn't that the way it works?
MR. SCHNAPPER: That's the -- that's the way
it works. Yes, that's the way it works. And that --
that is the way it works in -- in a Title VII case
because of the language of the statute. The juries
routinely get that instruction in those cases. That's
certainly proof --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in -- in response
further to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I think
Justice Souter's, too, is there -- are there any
tactical difficulties or strategic difficulties that
counsel face if they don't quite know which way the
burden is going to shift before trial: The -- the
number of witnesses you have waiting in the hallway or
-- this -- this would be after summary judgment.
MR. SCHNAPPER: No more than would normally
be the case. What happened here in terms of jury
instructions was typical, which was the parties proposed
their differing instructions a week before trial, the
instructions were resolved at the end of trial. That --
that happens all the time.
Sometimes if the parties don't know how the
instructions are going to come out, that complicates
their tactics, but that happens every day in trials.
Thank you.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Could -- before you sit
down, I -- I have been trying to figure out Justice
White's opinion in Price Waterhouse. I mean, indeed he
-- he voted to -- to remand the case, as did -- as did
the four in the plurality, but for a very different
reason. They remanded because -- "We reverse the court
of appeals' judgment against Price Waterhouse because
the courts below erred by deciding that the defendant
must make" the proof of he would have been fired anyway
by clear and convincing evidence. That -- that was the
basis for their reversing and remanding.
That was not Justice White's, because -- he
said "because the court of appeals required Price
Waterhouse to prove by clear and convincing evidence
that it would have reached the same" -- "in the absence
of the improper motive. Rather than merely requiring
proof by a preponderance of the evidence, I concur in
the judgment reversing this case in part and remanding.
With respect to the employer's burden, however, the
plurality seems to require that the employer submit
objective evidence." And he disagreed with that.
MR. SCHNAPPER: All right. There -- there
were a number of different issues in the case. The
first, the court of appeals had held that when the
burden is on the employer to show it would have made the
same decision anyway, the employer has to meet that
burden with clear and convincing evidence.
The plurality and Justice White, the whole
court rejected that.
Secondly, the plurality suggested that the
employer in response would have to have objective
evidence. Justice White rejected that and the objective
evidence standard has not been followed by the lower
courts in -- in the wake of that.
The third question was whether the burden
should be placed on the employer. On that issue the
Court was divided six to three. Six Justices, as we --
as we noted, were for that burden allocation. The --
Justice Kennedy and -- and yourself and the Chief
Justice dissented. So there were many issues.
Thank you. I would like to reserve the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Blatt.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
I think both on a substantive level and a
procedural level Desert Palace largely resolves this
--
case. The question presented is the one of should you
have a direct evidence requirement to obtain a mixed
motive instruction under the Age Act. And there is the
procedural posture, which is Desert Palace left
unresolved a lot of very difficult and complicated
questions about when do you get to the jury on mixed
motive and what is the requirement that separates a
mixed motive motivating factor instruction from the
"but-for" or commonly known as the McDonnell Douglas.
And Desert Palace left all that unresolved.
On the question presented, there is the same
conflict in the circuits under the Age Act. It is the
same conflict in the circuits that was under Title VII
-- is do you need any kind of evidentiary special
showing to get to a mixed motive; and, if so, is it non-
circumstantial evidence or evidence that directly ties
JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this? Do
you think that there is a tenable distinction between a
mixed motives case and a non-mixed motives case? In
every employment discrimination case that gets beyond
summary judgment, aren't there mixed motives at play?
MS. BLATT: I think there is a lot to be
said for that argument, and this is a very difficult and
unsettled question under Title VII. I think what would
be on the table if this Court ever had an appropriate
vehicle -- and this certainly is not the appropriate
vehicle to get into this question -- there would be
several options on the table. You could have what your
view suggests, which is after summary judgment you could
get a motivated factor instruction that the jury would
be permitted to find both impermissible and permissible
motives.
You could also have a special verdict form
that asks the jury: Do you find that there were two
causes, one of which was an impermissible factor? And
you could have a situation which I think prevails in
trial courts now -- and it has been the EEOC's practice
-- which is -- and it's not the most analytically clean,
but they basically give the instruction, either a
determinative cause or motivating factor instruction, on
what they think best fits the evidence.
And I think it's important for the Court to
understand, as we -- the law exists now under Title VII
and under all the other anti-discrimination acts, there
are two regimes out there. There is a mixed motive
regime and a determining factor regime.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Couldn't -- couldn't any
Title VII case be presented in either framework?
MS. BLATT: Yes. But this is -- I will also
give you, which I think is important especially when you
write your opinion, the three reasons why you should not
resolve this very difficult question in this case. And
the first is that it wasn't pressed or passed on below
or raised in the brief in opposition and did not receive
full briefing by the parties and all the amici.
And, second, just as you left this issue
open in footnote 1 of your opinion in Desert Palace,
Judge Collatin writing for the court recognized this
precise issue in footnote 3 of the court's opinion on
petition appendix page 12, saying: Assuming there is no
direct evidence requirement, we are going to have to
figure out when is it appropriate to give a motivating
factor instruction, absent the -- the language,
expressed language in Title VII?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you --
MS. BLATT: The third reason --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I will let you get
your third reason in in a minute, but why -- do you
really think it's fair to pick one part of a complicated
test that the court has constructed and say, well, this
one doesn't make any sense, and pull it out? I mean,
maybe it only makes sense in the context of the whole
construct, or maybe none of the elements actually make
sense. But it seems to me very artificial to focus on
one aspect and say, let's fix this, without assessing
what its impact is on the rest of the text.
MS. BLATT: I see your point, even though
that is exactly what you did in Desert Palace. But
Price Waterhouse is a two-decade-old decision. We're 20
years past that and it has been essentially codified in
Title VII. So no matter what you do to, quote unquote,
"fix this" under the Age Act, every -- the bulk of the
discrimination cases fall under Title VII, and a
motivating factor instruction is codified, and you
unanimously held in Desert Palace there is no special
evidentiary requirement.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was -- that was
because -- that was because of the 1991 Act which
addressed Title VII and quite deliberately left ADEA
out.
MS. BLATT: Unless you overrule Price
Waterhouse, which would be an upheaval in the law, and
certainly -- this wouldn't be the appropriate case to do
it, all the courts of appeals have unanimously held
under the Age Act and under a wide variety of State
statutes and other Federal discrimination statutes that
the Price Waterhouse burden-shifting framework applies.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are asking us to
overrule the aspect of Price Waterhouse involving direct
evidence, at least if you look at Justice O'Connor's
opinion.
MS. BLATT: I don't think you need to decide
that question. In a lot of other contexts, you have
said, well, there is language in our opinion that may
have been confusing or it's not clear what the holding
is, but we henceforth are going to clarify, here's what
the law is.
You did it in the recent crack cocaine case
in Spears, you did it in your nude dancing case, and you
did it in a case called Jefferson v. City of Tarrant
County, an opinion Justice Ginsburg authored, that you
said: Well, there is language here that substantive
cases make clear, and there is lots of reasons why you
would not impose a direct evidence requirement, however
you define that term.
Since Desert Palace, there is a decision of
Sprint/United v. Mendelsohn. And I think that case a
fortiori forecloses all the arguments made by the other
side that, well, even if it doesn't mean
non-circumstantial evidence, it must mean something that
is highly relevant to the issue of discrimination. In
Sprint/United you said we're not going to have a per se
rule about what is relevant to prove discrimination.
The Court said the same thing in Reeves. I think that
was a unanimous decision.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what would
be the position of the Solicitor General on just saying
let's get rid of all these artificial court
constructions and say this is like any other case, the
plaintiff has the burden of persuasion and the defendant
can come up with what defenses he has, including that, I
did this for some other reason, it wasn't because of
age, and the jury looks at it and decides who they
believe?
MS. BLATT: You would still have the same
issue as you have under the constitutional regime of
what is causation? And if you ask my opinion, the
Solicitor General in Price Waterhouse itself argued
something different that no Justice adopted. We argued
a standard of causation that no one -- no one was
persuaded by. Six went off on this motivating factor
with the burden shifting approach, and three of the
Justices would have applied a straight "but for"
causation --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The statute -- the
statute has language. It says "because of." Tell the
jury that.
MS. BLATT: Absolutely. And it did in Title
VII, and this Court, for better or worse -- regardless
of what you think, in Price Waterhouse six Justices
defined the language "because of." And we have Price
Waterhouse now that is codified. And so --
JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any -- is there any
empirical evidence to show whether any of this really
makes a difference. Have there been studies on the
effect of the 1991 amendments, whether they have made a
difference in the way cases actually come out?
MS. BLATT: No. Let me just say two
responses. Not that I have seen empirical. I can tell
you the EEOC's experience, and that is they sometimes
prefer a "but for" all the burden being on them and
sometimes they prefer the motivating factor instruction.
And despite what Respondent points out, they have some
defendants that think they like the affirmative defense.
And sometimes counsel just agree on what the
instruction should be. And it hasn't caused that much
of a problem, although there is a lot of confusion about
this kind of case, where the defendant is insisting on
one instruction and the plaintiff wants another
instruction, and that's what Judge Collatin is reserving
in a footnote saying: On remand I am going to have to
sort this out.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of what the
parties may prefer, isn't it likely that the jury,
regardless of instruction, is going to say something
like this: If we find that -- that age really was in
the boss's mind when he fired the person, and the boss
comes in, regardless of the instructions, and says the
guy's work was no good, he got late -- he arrived late
and so on, the jury is going to say: Did they really
fire him because he was old or because he didn't come to
work on time?
They are going to do the same thing that
they are going to do on the burden-shifting instruction,
probably, aren't they?
MS. BLATT: I mean -- there are two kinds of
jury findings. There is -- but the problem in all this
area, if you do ever get a case that is appropriate, I
think what the Court should start with the assumption
which Justice Alito alluded to: Price Waterhouse was a
bench trial. The 1991 amendments under Title VII were
against the backdrop of non-jury trials. And both the
Price Waterhouse decision and the language of Title VII
are written ex post. It's assuming some artificial
world where there was a finding of mixed motive.
But in today's world everything needs to be
done ex ante. We need to know how to instruct the jury,
and that's the fundamental problem.
If you are looking at ex post world, you are
exactly right, a jury could either find this was all a
pretext, I think what was really going on was ageism or
sexism or racism, or it could find, a split the baby, I
think it's both. But you can't possibly know that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You can't know it --
MS. BLATT: -- going in.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But if you said to the
jury, do the right thing, they'd probably come out the
same way it would come out if you gave the burden
shifting instruction, I think.
MS. BLATT: I think you are basically
catching on the point that a lot of counsel in the real
world are basically deciding, what do we think the jury
is going to be most on our side with, with which
instruction. And it's not always clear going into the
case, and maybe depending on the relative strength of
the legitimate factor being asserted. Some defendants
may prefer the affirmative defense. Some may think, no,
it's prejudicial, we don't want that, we want a straight
determining factor instruction.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But the reason I raise the
issue is, if -- if we are saying do we ditch Price
Waterhouse, my questions I guess are suggesting
something to the effect, what difference does it make?
MS. BLATT: Well, I don't think you can
ditch Price Waterhouse as a practical matter, because
you are going to create -- I mean -- massive confusion,
not only under the Age Act, but under the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, a
variety of labor statutes, disciplinary statutes --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Juries -- juries are
smarter than judges.
MS. BLATT: Well, you can do that, but all
the problems you think you are solving, you are going to
have to face them in Title VII. That is the bulk of
discrimination law, and you have two standards of
causation in that statute right now.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead and make
your third point briefly.
MS. BLATT: Oh, on why you shouldn't decide
it? It's essentially this, that this is complicated,
difficult under Title VII. That's the leading
anti-discrimination statute. I think the Court may want
to resolve these very legitimate important questions in
a Title VII case, because you have got statutory
language.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Phillips?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
It does seem to me in some ways the
Petitioner and Respondent in this case are ships passing
in the night because the issues here are unbelievably
complicated. I will say in 25 years of advocacy before
this Court I have not seen one area of the law that
seems to me as difficult to sort out as this particular
one is.
That said, I would hope that the Court would
seize upon this as an opportunity to provide some
significant clarity in the law, rather than seize this
as an opportunity to decide this case on the potentially
most narrow ground, which, frankly, as far as I can
tell, will not only not decide this case, ultimately,
but certainly will not do anything to resolve the mass
confusion that seems to exist among the lower courts.
So, I would urge the Court not to evaluate
this case strictly on the question of whether direct
versus circumstantial evidence is the appropriate way to
proceed. In part that's because that is not the basis
on which the Eighth Circuit decided this case.
The Eighth Circuit said that it interpreted
Justice O'Connor's separate opinion calling for direct
evidence as talking about a specific link between the
proof -- in the proof of the discriminatory
considerations and the adverse action that was taken.
So, direct versus circumstantial doesn't even -- you
know, if you remand to evaluate non-circumstantial
evidence, you are still not going to be in a position
where that is going to affect the outcome.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand the court
of appeals, it said that Justice O'Connor's opinion was
the controlling opinion, it was the decision on the
narrowest ground; therefore, the lower courts ought to
take that decision as the law made by Price Waterhouse.
Then there's a question of what did she mean
by direct evidence? But I think the Eighth Circuit
certainly did say Justice O'Connor's opinion states the
law of Price Waterhouse, and that was the basis on which
their decision turned.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, then -- of course, they
go on to say what they think that decision means. But
there is no question, Justice Ginsburg, that that is the
basis for that holding.
So, I mean, I suppose the Court could say,
no, we disagree with the basis of Price Waterhouse as
Justice White's separate concurring opinion, which,
frankly, I think it is -- you know, having read it more
times than I care to admit, is not exactly clear as to
what he thinks the appropriate standard would have been.
At least Justice Ginsburg's provides the formulation
that the lower courts can use to try to provide some
kind of a jury instruction --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice O'Connor.
MR. PHILLIPS: Did I say Ginsburg?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
(Laughter.)
MR. PHILLIPS: I'm going to hear about this
one.
(Laughter.)
MR. PHILLIPS: I apologize.
But the problem -- you know, the -- but the
fundamental problem is, it's just simply not clear what
Justice White's opinion means. And therefore, the lower
courts have seized upon an opinion that at least
provided serious guidance that they could embody into a
jury instruction.
It goes to the point that Justice Alito was
making, which is that, it's one thing when you are
dealing with bench trials and what do you ask the judge
to do, it's something fundamentally different when you
are shifting the burden of proof.
Justice Kennedy asked the question does it
make a difference tactically, and the same question
Justice Souter in some ways was asking and the answer is
clearly it does, and you can see it in this case.
Here's a situation where the defendant prior to the
trial shows up, or when the jury gets selected. Opening
statement says there is going to be no evidence of
actual age discrimination in this case. The case is
tried on that theory. The basis for the judgment that
there is going to be no evidence of age discrimination
in this case is the discovery, extensive discovery that
has taken place, where there is no statements by anyone
talking about age, no other employee who believes that
he or she had been ever been affected by age. It's all
of this very abstract claim and the notion that somehow
there is no better explanation for what happened except
for age.
You go through the entirety of the trial
saying to the jury, there is no evidence of age, there
is no evidence of age discrimination, and then at the
last minute, not because you have asserted an
affirmative defense -- because we didn't assert an
affirmative defense -- one is foisted on us by the jury
instruction that the plaintiff asked for in this
particular case that says that if there is a motivating
factor, if you can prove a motivating factor -- which it
is interesting to get to the specifics of a motivating
factor, which means it played a part or a role, which is
about as minimalist as you can have it -- then the
burden shifts and we then have the burden to prove that
we would have taken the same action notwithstanding age.
Well, that's a very different inquiry, and
when you go to the jury at the end you can't conceive --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, can I ask
you --
MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you your views
on a question that I've asked myself over and over again
and had trouble finding the answer. Supposing a company
appointed a committee to decide whether or not to fire
X. And the committee came back and said: "Yes, you
should fire him; he's too old and he's late to work
every day."
Now -- and that's all the evidence in the
record. Would the -- would the judge be obliged to
enter a judgment on summary judgment -- at the end of
the plaintiff's case, to enter judgment for the
defendant?
MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't believe he would
be required to enter judgment on the defendant.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Because all that would
have been proved was there is one motivating factor
there, but not necessarily a decisive one.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but I -- it does seem
to me that the jury -- it would be fair to ask the jury
to decide which of those two considerations probably
played the greater role. But I think -- and that's why
I think taking it to the jury is one thing.  Switching
the burden of proof to insist that we prove that the --
that the nondiscriminatory ground was the primary reason
for the decision is -- is an inappropriate way to
proceed because there is no basis in the statute for
that. The plaintiff still retains the burden to prove
that there was discrimination because of.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But he has only proved
that it is one of two possible motivating factors, but
that is sufficient in your view to get to the jury.
MR. PHILLIPS: I would think that that would
be sufficient to get to the jury, because I don't think
we have to prove -- I don't think the plaintiff has to
prove, you know, obviously, beyond a reasonable doubt or
anything. I mean, I think the jury could fairly say
that those are the two grounds, and I think in some ways
that -- that is the sort of common sense basis on which
Price Waterhouse was decided. And it's -- you know,
it's important -- if -- you know, the Chamber of
Commerce brief actually focuses a great deal, Justice
Stevens, on this multi-member decisionmaking body. And
you know, it seems to me if you look at cases like Mt.
Healthy and Price Waterhouse, those are all cases where
you have multi-member decisionmakers, and some of whom
may have expressed some biases and others of whom
clearly didn't, and how do you deal with that situation,
which impresses me as fundamentally different that the
situation here where you have a single supervisor
dealing with a single employee and where the case is
tried on the theory that there has been no
discrimination whatsoever, and it's up to the jury to
make that determination at the end, and at the last
minute we have the jury instruction that shifts the
burden to us notwithstanding that --
JUSTICE BREYER: Would you --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- we never sought to make
this an affirmative defense.
JUSTICE BREYER: Would you think you should
have the burden in the following situation? At 10:00
o'clock on March 21st the employer says: I am going to
get rid of Smith because he's too old.
MR. PHILLIPS: Uh-huh.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's it. Writes out the
letter, "Good-Bye, Smith." An hour later someone walks
into the employer's office and says: "I've discovered
that Smith was just convicted of larceny." All right?
Now, he already fired Smith because he was too old. But
I take it he can make the defense:  Well, Smith would
have been fired anyway; that isn't the reason I fired
him, but he would have been fired anyway, and he can get
off. But he should make that defense, shouldn't he?
MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, that's a Banner case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So the answer is
yes?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, absolutely.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now we have
the same situation, but the jury has said this bad
reason, his age, was a motivating factor.
MR. PHILLIPS: Played a role.
JUSTICE BREYER: To me -- it didn't say
played a role.
MR. PHILLIPS: Yeah, it did.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what it says in this
instruction that I have -- I don't see the other one --
MR. PHILLIPS: It's on page 10 of the joint
appendix.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I have on page 7 of
the -- of appellant's brief that the instruction was
"the plaintiff's age was a motivating factor in
defendant's decision."
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But -- right. It
just --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now when I read that, I
think --
MR. PHILLIPS: Can I just, if you go to the
next instruction --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. PHILLIPS: -- it says a -- "Plaintiff's
age was a motivating factor if plaintiff's age played a
part or a role in the defendant's decision." So "a
motivating factor" is a very narrow formulation --
JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, okay, all right,
fine.
MR. PHILLIPS: -- as instruction in this
particular case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Perfect, perfect. I didn't
want to complicate it, but that may work in your favor
to complicate it, and I want to be fair.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. It played a part.
It did have a role: Age motivated in part. Now why
isn't that the end of the matter? Because we have a
statute that says age shouldn't play a role in. "Play a
role" means it made a difference. I mean, to me.
Otherwise it played no role. It was an understudy, a
ghost. It "played a role" if it would have made a
difference. "Played a part," it would have made a
difference, just like my first case.
So we have an action, other things being
equal, that should be illegal under this statute. But
then, just as in the first case, we give the employer a
defense: If you can show that in the absence of that
age there in your mind, you would have done it anyway,
which means the mix of motives would have been
different, then you get off.
So, if in the first case we in fact say it
should be on the -- burden should be on the employer,
why shouldn't it be in the second case?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean -- in the first
place, saying that something is a motivating factor or
played a role is, as a sufficient basis on which to
impose liability, is flatly inconsistent with what this
Court has said numerous time. It said it in Burdine, it
said it in Reeves, it said it in Hazen Paper, it said it
I think last term in the Kentucky case, where it says it
has to play a role and be determinative. And that's the
standard the Court has announced over and over again in
age discrimination cases.
The "a motivating factor" formulation does
come in Title VII, but that's because of the 1991
statute that specifically frames the argument in terms
of "a motivating factor." So the -- the bottom line
here is that, unless the Court deviates from the
historic practice, which is if you are in civil
litigation the plaintiff retains the burden of proof
throughout the process --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Price Waterhouse
deviated -- that was --
MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: We have these two regimes
out there. You are reciting McDonnell Douglas and say
everything should follow that pattern, but to do that
you have to overrule Price Waterhouse, which gave
recognition to the mixed motive framework that comes out
of Mt. Healthy.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, my basic point on Price
Waterhouse is that it seemed to me reasonably clear that
a majority of the Court, whether you -- whether you rely
upon Justice White or Justice O'Connor -- clearly didn't
intend for the jury -- for the burden of proof to shift
willy-nilly. But it's supposed to be an exception to
the rule, narrowly defined. And the reality --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper recognized
when I asked this question, how does this differ from
the prima facie case that you make under McDonnell
Douglas and -- he said: We don't have to just make a
preliminary showing; we have to establish by a
preponderance of the evidence that the prohibited
discrimination was a motivating factor.
MR. PHILLIPS: Played -- played a role.
There is no question about that, Justice Ginsburg. But
that is not much different, frankly, from a prima facie
showing. The truth is if you only make a prima facie
showing and the defendant doesn't show up, you will have
in fact satisfied your burden.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you will get to the
jury and if the jury accepts all your evidence, the jury
can find in your favor. But the difference between a
prima facie showing and what has to be shown here is,
the jury must actually find, based on your at least
prima facie evidence, that age was a motivating factor,
and until the jury makes that finding, if it is properly
instructed, it doesn't get to the question of whether
the defendant has any burden to show something in
response. Isn't that correct?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is no question --
I mean, although again what a motivating factor means is
still to my mind extraordinarily narrow in this --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, let me
just --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- or limited in terms of
what is required here.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not quite sure I
understand one thing. If it's a motivating factor, it's
enough to get by summary judgment and get the case to
the jury, but the -- the defendant will still win, if I
understand all this, if he -- if the defendant proves,
yes, I did do and it may have had an influence on it,
but he would have fired him anyway. And if he -- if he
can prove under Mt. Healthy that, yes, he thought about
age and that -- what raised the issue and everything
else, but after he got all through, he was clear he
fired him because he was a lousy salesman --
MR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- and he wins.
MR. PHILLIPS: Clearly he would win under
those circumstances, but the problem there is --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So he does not lose just
because you say it's a motivating factor.
MR. PHILLIPS: No, he doesn't lose, but the
question is, what do you do once you make that finding?
Do you, in fact, at the plaintiff's behest, shift the
burden of proof to the defendant? I mean, it admits one
thing, and the Solicitor General, you know, has properly
identified that in some instances the defendants as a
tactical matter are willing to accept as an affirmative
defense and -- and pursue the course you just
articulated, Justice Stevens.
But that's not what happened in this case.
We were not prepared to accept the idea that age played
a role.  We still don't think the evidence supports
that. That's obviously not the issue here before us,
but it does make it extremely important to resolve the
question of, at what stage can you foist, essentially --
JUSTICE BREYER: Will you --
MR. PHILLIPS: --- an affirmative defense on
the other side?
JUSTICE BREYER: Will you go back? I'm
sorry to be hung up on this point. Maybe there are
cases that just prove I am wrong. But I'm -- I'm
trying to figure out -- let's try other areas of the
law. The dam is a nuisance. We now show, to prove that
it's a nuisance, that it played a role in the death of
my fish. I mean, isn't that the end of the case?
Damages might be at issue -- how much of a role -- but
as far as liability is concerned the gears were rusty.
The rusty gears played a role in the derailing of the
train. Again, it might be a question of who is
responsible for what, but that there is liability I
think in most areas of tort law would be over once you
prove that the defendant's factor played a role.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: So is the law here -- am I
wrong about ordinary tort law? Possibly. I don't know
it that well. Is it that I -- is it that this area is
special? Is it that there are cases so you can say any
of those three? I am prepared to be totally wrong. I
hope not.
MR. PHILLIPS: I am always reluctant to say
that, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: You can say that.
MR. PHILLIPS: I think that, in ordinary
tort law, the standard of causation is both a
combination of "but for" and proximate causation, so --
JUSTICE BREYER: And I think "played a role"
combines at least the necessary condition, but I don't
know --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't think --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- if you have to --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- that's a fair --
JUSTICE BREYER: "Played a role" -- how did
it play a role if it was not a necessary?
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, at least as
I read the difference between the plurality opinion in
Price Waterhouse and -- and all of the other opinions in
that case, Price Waterhouse's plurality said a
motivating factor is actually a standard below "but for"
causation. The plurality was unwilling to accept even
"but for" causation as a requirement under the Age
Discrimination and Employment Act. The rest of the
Justices seemed to not -- not accept that. But that
seems to me the very -- yes, the basic holding of the
plurality -- again, not of the Court -- is that
something less than "but for" causation is required. I
would be delighted, candidly, if the court would go back
to just "but for" causation as the element of age
discrimination because I think, if you get to that
point, you get out of this business of trying to figure
out at what point do you shift the burden. If you --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that question -- I
think it can't be before us. We would certainly want to
know what the government's position is on it. And Ms.
Blatt was very clear that the government is not taking a
position on that issue today. Your brief in opposition
did not so much as mention McDonnell Douglas. So how is
anybody to think that was at stake, that that regime,
which you later clarify in your Respondent's brief, you
think should be the sole test? How could that come into
this case when it's not in the brief in opposition and,
therefore, it's not in the Petitioner's brief and it's
not in the government's brief?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, to be clear about this,
I'm not pushing so much the, quote, McDonnell Douglas
framework as I am Burdine, Hazen Paper, and the other
cases that talk about "determinative factor." And all
we're saying is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your line is
following that same formula. All those cases are
following that litany: prima facie case, discriminatory
reason --
MR. PHILLIPS: Determinative factor, right.
I think the answer to the question, Justice Ginsburg, is
the -- the way the Chief Justice asked the question,
which is, how sensible is it to pull the one thread out
of -- out of the Price Waterhouse analysis, assuming
that Justice O'Connor speaks for the Court in some
sense, you know, without examining how that plays in,
given the underlying theory of the case? And I think
that's a perfectly valid point. If the Court thinks
additional briefing is warranted, then it would seem to
me the right answer is to -- is to call for additional
briefing, but I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Solicitor General
says, well, this is going to affect Title VII. It's
going to affect all kinds of other acts. This is a
watershed.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Kennedy,
clearly it's going to affect Title VII.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- pardon me?
MR. PHILLIPS: Clearly is it going to affect
Title VII.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it's statutory.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, because there's a
specific statute that defines it as a motivating factor,
shifts the burden, and creates an entire remedial regime
that doesn't exist under the age discrimination statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's -- let's assume we
have authority to incorporate the Title VII
jurisprudence into the ADEA area as a matter of choice.
Are there reasons why there should be distinctions
between the two regimes?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the primary one
is the 1991 amendment, where Congress clearly changed
the language in Title VII.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there reasons of
administration or fairness other than -- I recognize
that one is statutory and the others would -- would be
our case law.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it seems to me it's
beyond that. I mean, there's almost a separation of
powers problem when you say it's statutory because,
again, Congress very consciously decided to modify Title
VII, created a complete regime. It would be a bit of a
stretch for this Court not only to modify the standards
in a way that would change substantive liability but
would create the -- the affirmative defense as a
remedial component of it.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in addition to that,
Mr. Phillips, isn't age more closely correlated with
legitimate reasons for employment discrimination than
race and other factors that are proscribed by Title VII?
MR. PHILLIPS: Both Congress and this Court
have recognized precisely that as a problem. I mean,
there are reasons to treat age discrimination
differently from other forms of discrimination. But,
again, you know, there's no question that if you revisit
Price Waterhouse, it will change some -- the Americans
with Disabilities Act and some of the other provisions.
But the reality is, if you are talking about
a mess to begin with, the truth is the lower courts are
in a state of -- of disrepair at this point in any
event. And it's even shown in this case.
I mean, the truth is the Eighth Circuit has
three different formulations of Justice O'Connor's
evidence standard: circumstantial, strong evidence, and
substantial evidence, substantial factor. So if you are
a district court judge sitting in the Eighth Circuit,
you can pick any one of those -- those three to go with.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to
Justice Stevens's hypothetical? You have two people
making a decision; one says it's because of age and the
one says it's because of something, and -- a legitimate
factor -- and you acknowledge that could get to the
jury?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I believe it could.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And is it under an
instruction that simply says "because of"?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes -- I mean, if you were
asking me how I would decide that case, yes, I think it
ought to be -- it ought to be because of.
Now, if the Court wants to formulate some
greater specificity of how the causation standards
apply, that's fine. But, at a minimum, it seems to me
the Court would do well to go back at least to the
notion of "but for" causation as embodied in the Age
Discrimination and Employment Act.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean --
you say --
MR. PHILLIPS: It has never rejected that as
a Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say "but for"
causation, but my understanding of Justice Stevens's
hypothetical is that it's going to be very hard to say
that one would not have had -- the discrimination, the
alleged action, would not have happened but for one
factor or the other if they are just two different
factors. You would just leave that up to the jury to
say because of?
MR. PHILLIPS: I -- it seems to me juries
are asked to make that kind of a decision. I agree with
Justice Souter: Juries are a lot smarter than the
lawyers.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but not only that,
but the jury would be free to say, well, there were both
clauses, and the one was illegal. But under the Mt.
Healthy defense, if they are convinced they would have
fired this guy anyway, the company gets off.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and I understand that.
And in those situations -- look, Justice O'Connor's
analysis of this certainly -- certainly plays to a kind
of gut feeling. When you -- and Mt. Healthy is a good
illustration of it, even maybe more so, when you say:
We are firing you for two reasons; one of them is
completely invalid, and the other is completely valid.
What are you supposed to do in that situation?
But it seems to me that under -- under
normal civil litigation rules, and the ones that
Congress clearly had in its mind, the approach you would
take under those circumstances say that's enough to get
you to the jury, but that's not enough to force the jury
to be instructed that they have to rule in favor of the
plaintiff unless the defendant can show that but-for,
that -- that no matter -- regardless of the
discriminatory animus, they nevertheless would have
taken precisely the same action. That, to me, is the
guts of -- of what -- of what this case is about.
It's not about direct versus circumstantial
evidence. It's about under what circumstances does the
burden of proof shift? And -- and in a case like this
where there's no assertion of an affirmative defense --
whereas, I think, Justice Stevens, in your situations,
there were -- you know, most likely you would expect a
defendant to say, I want to accept that burden because I
think I can in fact prove something.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I know, but inevitably in
these cases the employer is really -- whether he calls
it an affirmative defense or -- or just a regular
resistance to the plaintiff 's case, the issue is: Did
-- would he have fired him anyway? And -- and if he --
if -- if that's what the jury believes, you can take
Justice Breyer's view and say that's -- that's not a
sufficient defense because they acted illegally.
But if you are allowed that, you are saying
notwithstanding the illegal motive, if you show that the
real reason I fired him was unrelated to that, then the
compelling reason, you win. And you win despite the
fact that the process may have violated the statute.
MR. PHILLIPS: There -- there is no question
about that. And it is -- again, the only question is:
Who bears the burden of proof? And what do you do with
all of those decisions of this Court that say that
the -- that the -- that the burden to -- to show that
age, or whatever, was the determinative factor rests
throughout on the plaintiff?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those weren't --
those weren't thought of in the mixed motive framework.
And what you want to do is get rid of the mixed motive
and say in a discrimination case there should be only
one regime, and the plaintiff should have the burden of
persuasion from start to finish. But that's not what
McDonnell Douglas did. It's not what the Eighth Circuit
did, which you acknowledge by not even bringing this up
until the brief on the merits.
So -- and you also said that Title VII is
out of it. The statute has taken care of it in 1991.
Ms. Blatt, I heard her say distinctly that -- that Title
VII would be affected. She urges us not to touch this
question.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think you have to go
back to the -- to the question that Justice Alito posed
actually, to say -- when -- when he asked her: How do
you -- how much sense does it make to think about mixed
motive versus other motive? Isn't it true that by the
time the case gets to the jury everything is mixed
motive, because there is going to be the claim that this
was -- and this is a great illustration of that concept.
There is a claim that age was the basis for the
decision, and there is a claim that there are any of a
thousand other possible reasons that are out there, and
age just didn't happen to be one.
And under those circumstances the question
is: What's the reasonable way to proceed?
Now, Justice Ginsburg, I apologize that we
didn't raise this specifically in the brief in
opposition. On the other hand, the reality is that the
primary position that was taken by the other side was
that this Court essentially can ignore or should
overrule a portion of Price Waterhouse as a consequence
of the -- of the intervening Costa decision.
And it seems to me under those
circumstances, if you are going to put the issue of the
validity of Price Waterhouse -- whatever it means -- at
issue, then it seems to us a reasonable response on the
merits to say, well, you shouldn't do it as -- as a --
in isolation. That that's a completely artificial
inquiry, and you ought to take a step back and say,
maybe we haven't gotten this right in the first place,
particularly given the difficulty of the lower courts in
trying to figure out exactly what Price Waterhouse
means.
Whose is the controlling opinion, and how do
you allocate these burdens and under what circumstances?
And given that the lower courts are in disarray, it
would seem to me this is a situation where I don't know
whether this is the best vehicle or the worst vehicle,
but it is certainly an appropriate vehicle for the Court
to step back and evaluate it.
And if the Court is concerned about whether
it has enough information to allow it to assess what
would be the -- the significant impact of revising Price
Waterhouse, then it seems to me the right answer would
be to ask the parties to -- to brief that in addition to
the way they briefed it at this stage. And now you
simply throw up your hands.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I assume -- and I
assume the government, because it would certainly be
informative to know what the agency responsible for the
administration of Title VII thinks of this question.
MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I don't disagree with
that, Justice Ginsburg. I -- I don't think there are
any -- any guidelines out there that speak directly to
this specific question. But, obviously, to the extent
that the Solicitor General could speak for the EEOC,
that would -- I am not denying that that would -- that
might be helpful. But I think what the -- what the
Court needs to do is recognize that what it cannot --
what it should not do in this case is take the -- the
very narrowest way of vacating and remanding. Because
if it follows that course, nothing will move. Nothing
will have been achieved by all the work that has been
put into this case at this point, because the court of
appeals didn't believe the difference was between direct
and circumstantial evidence. And, therefore, the Court
at some point is going to have to evaluate beyond the
quality of the evidence what quantity of evidence is
appropriate under the circumstances.
It seems to me the Court has that in front
of it. The jury instruction in this case shifted the
burden way too early or on -- on way too little showing.
A part, a role, that's not enough to shift the burden
under -- I don't even think under Justice White's
version.
JUSTICE SOUTER: We can't -- I mean there is
no question about quantitative evidence here.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is a question
about the adequacy of the jury instruction.
JUSTICE SOUTER: The adequacy of the jury
instruction, but there isn't a question as to whether
the issue should have gone to the jury in the first
place. And I -- I think that --
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. No, I don't -- there
is no question that -- that -- well, there is a question
on that. It's not before you. It's -- it's back in
front of the Eighth Circuit.
But there is still the issue of whether a
motivating factor, meaning that it played a role, is a
sufficient basis on which to trigger the -- the burden
shifting instruction in this case. That -- that is the
narrowest basis on which this Court could affirm by
simply saying that Justice White's opinion requires a
substantial showing. The instruction in this case
clearly doesn't accomplish that, and, therefore, the
Court should set that aside, or the Court should affirm
the Eighth Circuit and remand so that the district court
can have a new trial on that issue.
If there are no further questions, I'd urge
the Court to affirm.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Now, Mr. Schnapper, two minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
We are in agreement with the government that
the Court should decide the -- the narrow question
presented and not revisit Price Waterhouse. If I might
respond to the question from Justice Breyer -- and I am
going to summarize to some extent materials which were
referred to in footnote 18 of our reply brief.
The Court ruled that there was a
circumstance, very well established, which under tort
law but-for causation was not the standard. And that
was the situation in Cory versus Havener, which is the
leading case in this area in which there were two
causes, each sufficient to have brought about the
result. And Cory was a case of two motorcyclists in
district court.
And the rule in those cases was that -- that
either cause -- that the tort feasor involved with
either cause could be held liable.
JUSTICE ALITO: Don't those cases involve
two independent physical causes of an event, not the
breaking down of human motivation into -- into separate
factors?
MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it's -- it's -- but
it's the analogous area of tort law.
JUSTICE BREYER: What they are trying to
say, which is -- which is making me think -- it is a lot
about -- we have a human being who did certain acts.
And we know this. We know that human being had a mix of
motives and that the bad motive played a role. It was a
motivating force. And that might be sufficient. It is
under Title VII. And if you want to interpret this by
Title VII, that's fine. That's the end of it.
But then we are going to let someone off if
we imagine a different, but hypothetical, situation.
The hypothetical is where the bad motive isn't there.
Well, it's hard to prove what human beings
would do in a hypothetical situation that isn't the real
situation. And I take it that's the reason we have
imposed this burden upon the employer.
Is there an analogy to that in tort law?
MR. SCHNAPPER: The -- the problem that
comes up with multiple causes is it is hard to
reconstruct what would happen. And there is a long line
of cases, including a number of decisions by Learned
Hand in 1938, one which we have cited, Transportation
Management, in which the lower courts have agreed that
where multiple factors are involved it's reasonable to
put the burden on the defendant which -- of sorting it
all out. And we think that is appropriate here.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
