ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM W. LOCKYER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LOCKYER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This Court has repeatedly communicated an
understanding of the appropriate deference owed to
State court fact finding in habeas review under 28
U.S.C., section 2254. Here, we don’t have a simple
case of the Ninth Circuit applying the proper standard
of deference, but getting the wrong result. The
problem is the Ninth Circuit doesn’t get the standard.
Although --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just at the -- at the
outset -- and I’m -- I’m not sure you’re prepared for
this, but the joint appendix, volume 2, is under seal, right?
MR. LOCKYER: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the course of the
argument, I think we’d be very interested in knowing
about the colloquy that the trial judge had with the
attorneys, and if it’s under seal, it’s a little bit
awkward to do that. Is there any reason that it has to
be kept under seal?
MR. LOCKYER: None -- none at all, Justice
Kennedy. I believe we provided the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I take it --
MR. LOCKYER: -- appendix 2 --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I take it that the --
the names of the jurors we don’t know because they’re
given numbers.
MR. LOCKYER: That’s correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So far as you know, the
counsel for the respondent would also have no
objection?
MR. LOCKYER: Neither of us have any
objection, and it’s been quoted extensively --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, it was then quoted
extensively in the Ninth Circuit I thought.
MR. LOCKYER: In -- in the briefs as well.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.
MR. LOCKYER: Thank you, Mr. Kennedy --
Justice Kennedy.
In this instance, the Ninth Circuit professes
fealty to AEDPA deference, but it seems simply too
easy, having sensed a constitutional injury, to become
willing to attribute error to the State court and to
substitute its own factual inferences for those of the
trial judge.
The way the Court decides this case can
provide further instruction to habeas courts to help
them avoid the Ninth Circuit error. I’d suggest at
least four instructions that might be considered.
First, confirming that the objective
reasonableness test, that inquiry under (d)(2), is like
that currently under (d)(1). That is, the factual
inquiry, like that under the legal inquiry, more
deferential than review for clear error.
Second, since it seems logical that State
fact finding should be entitled to equal, if not
greater, respect than that now accorded State court
resolution of legal issues under (d)(1), we’ve argued
for adoption of the Jackson v. Virginia kind of
standard as consistent with the letter and spirit of
AEDPA, meaning that witness credibility determinations
rarely may be overturned, and that all of the evidence
must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the
factfinder.
Third, although Miller-El v. Dretke
represented an extraordinarily egregious and I
personally think undeniable violation of Batson, some
might react to a whiff of a little smoke as a Miller-El
fire. Proper resolution of this case can make it clear
that Miller-El v. Dretke dealt with a outlier and that
the traditional line of this Court’s habeas cases,
restricting Federal courts from second-guessing a State
judge’s credibility calls, retain their vitality.
Finally and specifically responding to Mr.
Collins’ argument that this case, it seems, is an
opportunity to confirm the well-established presumption
of correctness for State court fact finding under
section 2254(e)(1), that it remains available in all
habeas cases. Collins’ view that the traditional
presumption now applies only in the rare case of
Federal evidentiary hearings would eviscerate the
traditional presumption. In my office --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it is -- it is
a little unusual to have under your view two different
sections, both addressed to the question of the
appropriate standard of review in a particular type of
proceeding. They seem either redundant or overlapping.
The theory on the other side at least distinguishes
them and argues that they apply in different
circumstances.
MR. LOCKYER: That’s true, Mr. Chief Justice.
Our view is that the (e)(1) test really focuses on
specific facts that have been found in State court.
The (d)(2) focus is on the decision, which presumably
would be a bundle of multiple facts, the decision of
the court and whether it was objectively unreasonable.
And to limit the (e)(1) presumption not only,
I think, being contrary to congressional intention when
AEDPA reforms were adopted, and your cases that have
applied both (e)(1) and (d)(2) as separate, independent
tests -- in my office, there are 320 attorneys that do
Federal habeas work, 120,000 hours of lawyering. If
you take out the capital cases, the non-capital Federal
habeas claims, only 2 or 3 percent ever go to a Federal
evidentiary hearing. So the result of reading that
(e)(1) without the presumption in the cold record case
means basically the State loses the presumption for
almost every habeas claim that we look at. So it would
seem to not be also supported by the statute’s clear
terms. There’s no limitation written into (e)(1) that
it -- it’s -- doesn’t apply across the board to all
habeas claims.
The --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the
contention in the particular proceeding that the
district court -- or the State fact finder did not, in
fact, make a determination, but simply gave the benefit
of the doubt to the prosecutor?
--
MR. LOCKYER: Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I think
that reading the transcript will show that the judge,
hearing the Batson motion, asking counsel to explain
the reasons for her strikes, allowing defense counsel
to comment and explain, and then the ruling of the
judge seems to be a general one, both contemplating
both demeanor and youthfulness, and benefit of the
doubt may refer back to the fact that there’s a dispute
about the challenged juror and whether she turned
aside, rolled her eyes in a dismissive and
disrespectful way. And the judge says, well, I didn’t
see that behavior, but I’ll give you the benefit of the
doubt. But I think the ruling is a general one that
subsumes both claims, youthfulness and demeanor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought youthfulness
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- I noticed the
defense attorney, respondent here, did not comment in
any way on the -- the demeanor of the -- of witness 16,
which means either the -- he -- he saw it and said
nothing or he -- he didn’t see it at all. We don’t
know.
MR. LOCKYER: Justice Kennedy, that’s
correct. There was no comment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is the
obligation that we impose on the prosecution in this
case to give a coherent explanation of why there -- the
juror was excused? That step has proceeded. We’re at
that step in Batson where an explanation has to be
given. What -- what have we said about how coherent
and complete that explanation has to be?
MR. LOCKYER: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Here, it seems that the
prosecutor was somewhat caught off guard or -- or
certainly was not extremely clear.
MR. LOCKYER: Well, we are in the middle of a
-- a trial, of course, and it happens quickly and, as
the Court has suggested, often peremptory --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I’m not so sure
quickly. They gave notice that there’d be a Batson
hearing. She should have known what’s going on.
MR. LOCKYER: Yes, sir. However, it was just
a short time later in the day, Justice Kennedy. There
was a break to dismiss the jury and then come back to
the Batson claim.
But the peremptories, as the Court has
frequently said, are intuitive, often inarticulable.
In this case, I think the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the point is once
there’s a Batson challenge, it has to be articulated.
MR. LOCKYER: Well, I think that happens.
That is, as soon as the prosecutor is asked to defend
her challenge, she does, and she talks about
youthfulness. She says the young person doesn’t have
ties in the community, doesn’t have a stake in the
community, is unmarried, perhaps has a greater
tolerance for drug crime with a small amount. This is
a three-strikes case. It would be a natural worry, I
think, for a district attorney to think that a third
strike, even though one and two were armed robbery and
rape -- that a third strike that’s a possession of a
small amount of drugs, you might need to worry about a
juror’s tolerance or worrying about that severity of
sentence.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but isn’t -- isn’t
the difficulty with your analysis there, General, that,
yes, she started out by -- by talking about
youthfulness. As I understand it, she started out talking
about youthfulness and the -- and the demeanor, the
rolling of the eyes.
MR. LOCKYER: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Sort of at the second stage,
again she spoke of youthfulness. Then at a third
stage, she said, well, it’s a combination of -- of age,
gender, and inexperience. Then she realized she was in
trouble, and she said, well, I really didn’t mean
gender because I -- I’d be in constitutional hot water
there. Then she said, well, I really don’t mean age
because there are other young people on the jury, and
I’m -- I’m not challenging them. So that the only
thing that was left was possibly that element of age
which refers to ties to the community.
And at the end of this long colloquy, in
which she has gone back and forth and back and forth
and -- and jettisoned some of her reasons, the trial
judge says, well, I didn’t see the eye-rolling, and I
guess I’ll give the benefit of the doubt to counsel. I
don’t know whether the judge is talking about the
benefit of the doubt on eye-rolling or the benefit of
the doubt on -- on ties to the community.
Assuming it’s ties to the community, that has
nothing to do, I suppose, with -- with the -- the fear
that a young person is going to be too sympathetic to a
defendant who’s up for the third time with a small
amount of drugs.
And at the end of the day, it seems to me we
have what Justice Kennedy’s question in the first place
suggested. We simply have an incoherent colloquy and a
response to the judge which simply does not tell you
what the judge is ruling on or the basis for the
ruling. All we know is that ultimately he’s saying I’m
rejecting the Batson challenge. That’s the problem
with -- with deference in this case.
What -- what is your response to that?
MR. LOCKYER: Well, thank you, Justice
Souter. First, I’d point to the language that the
judge provided, which was in regard to juror 16, the
only one that is at issue, the court did not observe
the demeanor. However, 16 was a youthful person, as
was 6, and then prepared to give the district attorney
the benefit of the doubt.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the district
attorney has -- I mean, the -- the point here is we’re
judging the district attorney’s responses, not the
judge’s responses.
MR. LOCKYER: Right.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What we want to know is what
the judge found and ruled upon. The district attorney,
as I understand it, has withdrawn the general claim
that youthfulness is a problem, and the only claim that
might have been -- might -- probably was comprehended
under youth that -- that remains is the claim of no
community ties. And I find it very difficult to tell
from the judge’s ruling whether the judge is saying,
yes, I think there’s a fair showing that there are no
community ties and that’s certainly a race-neutral
reason. I don’t know what the judge was -- was --
MR. LOCKYER: If I may, Justice Souter. The
DA never withdrew the youthful claim.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, didn’t the DA say,
look, youth alone doesn’t -- doesn’t explain my reasons
because there are other young people on the jury that
-- that we’re not challenging, and -- and I don’t want
to suggest that all young people should be
disqualified?
MR. LOCKYER: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: General, does -- does the
judge have to find what the reason for the strike was,
or does the judge have to find what the reason for the
strike wasn’t?
MR. LOCKYER: The judge has to find that it
was not a racially discriminatory strike.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And if there are several
allegations and -- and each of them is somewhat
doubtful but, on balance, he says, I give the benefit
of the -- of the doubt to the -- to the district
attorney, it’s his indication that, as a matter of
fact, he finds that the reason wasn’t race.
MR. LOCKYER: Justice Scalia, your direct --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question,
General?
MR. LOCKYER: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: There are really two kinds
of Batson problems as I see it. There are some cases
where the prosecutor is -- just is deliberately keeping
African Americans off the jury, and there -- there’s no
question there’s a violation there.
But I’m wondering if there isn’t another
category where persons are unconscious of their own
subconscious bias and not realizing that they
themselves have an unconscious fear that perhaps an
African American might not be a sympathetic juror.
Would that kind of failure to really identify the
problem within the prosecutor’s own conception of the
case -- would that be a Batson violation in your view?
MR. LOCKYER: Well, probably not, because the
requirement is that the strike be intentionally done.
That is, there’s an intentionality. If it’s
unconscious, as you suggest, Justice Stevens, I -- I
would think that wouldn’t qualify.
JUSTICE STEVENS: If, for example, the judge
saw that over a period of time, a particular prosecutor
had hunches about jurors over and over again and they
just happened to be black most of the time. That would
not justify a -- a Batson challenge.
MR. LOCKYER: Well, there might be a pattern
over time.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but she’s totally
convinced of the good faith of the prosecutor. And I’m
not suggesting bad faith.
MR. LOCKYER: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But just realizes this
person has an unconscious bias that shows up in the --
in the pattern of challenges. Would that be a
justified challenge?
MR. LOCKYER: You might be able to deduce
intent from -- infer it from a variety of challenges.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No. You have to accept his
hypothetical as he gave it. Assuming that the
attorney, the district attorney, was in good faith.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.
MR. LOCKYER: In good faith?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Assuming that the --
the attorney did not think that he or she was striking
the juror because of the juror’s race.
MR. LOCKYER: Justice Stevens and Scalia, I
would rely on the trial judge to make a determination
of the intention of the district attorney --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And if the trial judge
determined --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the question is would
he --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- based -- based on the
history of several trials and so forth, that this
prosecutor unconsciously had this hunch with respect to
black jurors but not others, that would be a sufficient
basis for a challenge.
MR. LOCKYER: I’d be inclined to say yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is no such --
that -- that’s very far from this case, General
Lockyer.
MR. LOCKYER: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I did -- I did have one --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that gives a lot of
power to district -- to -- to the district judge,
doesn’t it? I mean, you know, this -- he says this --
this U.S. attorney really doesn’t honestly believe that
he’s biased, but I think, being the great psychologist
that I am, that this United States attorney, or
whoever, is -- is really biased and -- and he’s -- I --
you really --
MR. LOCKYER: Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you really want the
system to run that way?
MR. LOCKYER: Well, Justice Scalia, I hope to
--
brief that one some day, but --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we -- can we go back
MR. LOCKYER: -- but -- but it’s a good --
it’s a good question even though I -- I don’t think
it’s what’s happening in this instance. And I mostly
would say we rely on the trial judge who’s there --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Except in this very case,
one gets the impression that the prosecutor was pretty
confused, but maybe she was acting in good faith.
MR. LOCKYER: I -- I believe that’s correct
from the record.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: She was certainly -- she
was certainly wrong on the law. When she -- when the
gender question came up, she said, well, that's not a
suspect category, and she seemed to be -- her notion
was that it was okay to aim for a jury that had an
equal number of men and women. And it was -- she
seemed to be thinking the same thing with regard to age
too. I agree with you she didn’t withdraw it, but was
-- the reasonable explanation was we don’t want too
many young people here. So I’m going to allow some,
but I want older people to dominate. But the gender --
she had to be told by the judge Batson applies to
gender. That -- that seemed -- that seemed strange to
me that -- that 2 years after, she would not know.
MR. LOCKYER: Justice Ginsburg, I think that
perhaps an explanation -- and, again, if the trial
judge thought it was reasonable -- is there some
compelling reason to read it a different way years
later on appeal after the California Court of Appeal, a
Federal magistrate, and a Federal district judge have
agreed with the trial judge’s perspectives.
But it could be that she is quoting, as
you’ll see in the transcript, California law that had
talked about jury balances. It’s good to have young
and old. It’s good to have different races.
I agree. You’re absolutely right. J.E.B. v.
Alabama had occurred a couple of years before, and the
judge does say, I don’t see, Ms. Satriano, that you are
seeking to justify excusing people of one ethnicity
based on gender. So he seemed to at least be saying,
you started with youth. Everything you said about
youth, ties in the community, tolerance for drug use,
unmarried, which might be distinctions with other young
people -- those -- do you have anything else to say?
And I -- I suspect she felt like compelled to come up
with some further explanation.
JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is the -- where
-- where is the place in what the judge -- when did
--
this eye-rolling take place? I can’t figure it out.
MR. LOCKYER: Okay. Yes. During the
judicial voir dire.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I have that in front of
MR. LOCKYER: And --
JUSTICE BREYER: What was the statement that
the judge made in respect to which the juror is
supposed to have rolled her eyes?
MR. LOCKYER: The district attorney simply
says with one of the questions to which you -- the
prospective --
JUSTICE BREYER: 	 Which question?
MR. LOCKYER: It’s unclear.
JUSTICE BREYER: So the reason I can’t find
it out is none of us know.
MR. LOCKYER: No, you’re right. I mean, it’s
one where -- it doesn’t say in the record eye-rolling.
JUSTICE BREYER: And it actually says it
wasn’t a question. It was a statement, and that’s why
I can’t figure it out.
MR. LOCKYER: It -- it seems to be where the
juror said yes in response to the voir dire, and then
JUSTICE BREYER: 	 Which was a question you
said --
MR. LOCKYER: -- turned aside. All we know
is yes was said. We don’t know what the question was.
JUSTICE BREYER: I see.
MR. LOCKYER: The -- a point I guess to be
made about this confusing transcript -- and of course,
I don’t know what the file looked like with respect to
Miller-El, but this is it. Obviously, there’s not a
lot to go on, and I think it suggests how vital it is
to rely on the trial court judge to make some
credibility determination. He’s there and sees the
district attorney and tries to, after making
appropriate inquiries, say that he accepts her non-
racial reasons.
Counsel for respondent does a lot to compare
to Miller-El and so perhaps it’s worth just
distinguishing briefly. There we have 10 of 11 African
American jurors struck. We have the lawyers doing the
questioning, trick questions, loaded questions,
complicated questions. We have the external evidence
of the Dallas manual recommending discriminatory
strikes. We have the cards with race written on them.
Here, we have a very brief, quick proceeding.
The judge is asking the questions and really resisting
lawyers’ attempts to add to that, to get more
information so you can make a valid assessment of the
juror that’s before you. And so in this instance,
obviously, relying on intuition, trial experience, she
exercises the two peremptory challenges, one of which
was withdrawn on appeal and not pursued, the other with
respect to the young person, the demeanor, and
youthfulness are the grounds given.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just a -- kind of
a background question? I noticed the judge pointed out
after ruling that he was under -- he -- I can’t
remember if it was a he or a she, but was under an
obligation to report its reasons for granting Wheeler
motion to the State bar.
MR. LOCKYER: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that -- did that
requirement apply after the Ninth Circuit decision? Is
there a requirement that the -- the lawyer be
investigated for possible discipline?
MR. LOCKYER: We tried to research it,
Justice Stevens, and we believe that it was a -- a
State court rule adopted subsequent to Wheeler. And
that -- of course, unlike the way in which it is
characterized in respondent’s briefs, it wasn’t a
warning to her, the district attorney, that is. It was
a general statement. If there’s a Batson claim, I’m
obligated to report.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I read it as
saying, and therefore I’m going to be careful about
finding that there’s been a Batson violation. And I
wonder if that’s consistent with what we want trial
judges to do when they’re hearing Batson challenges.
MR. LOCKYEAR: Justice Kennedy, I
frankly didn’t read it that way. It just seemed to be
he was stating the fact, that it would be an obligation
to report. Clearly, it has some impact on how people
feel about the judicial system and the particular
lawyer’s reputation if the judge were to affirm the
motion. But I -- I would expect the judge was doing
his job and performing his duties correctly.
JUSTICE BREYER: If you have a minute, you
might -- I don’t know if you -- if this is very useful.
But I’ve taken this point of view that -- that there’s
no way to get to the bottom of the use of stereotypes
in cases like this, a perfect example. And therefore,
the only thing to do, consistent with the Constitution,
is no peremptories.
MR. LOCKYER: Well, I know that’s your view,
Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: You have 30 seconds. You
want to say how irresponsible that is, right?
MR. LOCKYER: I prefer to keep the tradition
and allow the peremptory challenges.
Thank you. I’ll reserve time, if I may.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.
Mr. Drozdowski, we’ll hear now from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. DROZDOWSKI
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit properly held that the
State appellate court decision represented an
unreasonable determination of facts because the
prosecutor did not give a single persuasive reason for
striking juror 16.
The circuit also rightly held that the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn’t the rolling
of the eyes a persuasive reason?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, here the rolling of
the eyes, first, is uncorroborated by the trial judge.
He says, quite frankly, I did not see it. And in his
ruling, he does not credit that rationale.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what -- what should
happen if the trial judge doesn’t see it and a counsel,
who’s observant, said, judge, I’ve got a problem with
--
this juror? I don’t know that the trial judge has to
-- has to see it, if he believes the counsel.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: That could be, but here the
trial court’s --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: We’ve -- we’ve all been --
been in court and -- and noticed that sometimes
witnesses or jurors or parties or even attorneys will
make faces and so forth that’s not consistent with --
with proper demeanor in a courtroom.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: That’s correct. But what’s
significant here is that this was a judge-conducted
voir dire where juror 16 would have been facing the
judge when giving her answer. So the judge would have
been in the best position to see the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you’re --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe the judge is reading.
A judge doesn’t watch -- watch the witness 100 percent
of the time. That’s not credible.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: As the Court has previously
mentioned, what we also have here is there’s no --
there’s no corroboration in the transcript that juror
JUSTICE BREYER: So what is the point? The
judge says, I’ll give the prosecution the benefit of
the doubt. Well, he -- he knows the prosecutor and he
believes the prosecutor. I didn’t see it, but I’ll
give him the benefit of the doubt. He told me that’s
what she did. What’s -- I mean, I really don’t see why
that isn’t, given the present law, sufficient.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, here, the trial
court’s ruling -- he says, I did not see the demeanor
complained of. However, juror 16 is youthful, as are
other jurors. I’m prepared to give the district
attorney the benefit of the doubt. So I think the
ruling here, if there is, indeed, a finding of no
discrimination, would be limited to the youth rationale
clearly by --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why?
JUSTICE BREYER: You mean benefit of the
doubt just refers to youth. I -- I read that as
referring to the whole story.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I -- it’s pretty
hard to read that as saying, I’ll give him the benefit
of the doubt in respect to the youth. It sounds as if
I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt in respect to
the reasons he gave for challenging her. There are two
other African American jurors on the jury. She is
useful -- youthful. He -- she saw him -- he saw her
rolling her eyes when -- what do you think about the
--
drugs or some other relevant question. And he says,
I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt. I mean, I
don’t see how to read that in a way that -- that comes
out the way you want it to come out.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well -- well, even --
JUSTICE BREYER: So tell me.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Okay. Even if the Court
concludes that the trial judge did credit the demeanor
rationale, it’s still a wholly unpersuasive reason to
give in light of everything else the prosecutor did
here. The demeanor rationale wasn’t the sole reason
given. It comes as part of a litany of reasons that
are all either unconstitutional, the gender rationale,
or contradicted or unsupported by the record.
And there was some discussion earlier about
this. Miller-El makes clear that the district attorney
must give the real reason for the strike, not just any
rational basis the prosecutor can think up. And when
we look at the transcript of the Batson hearing here,
we see a prosecutor scrambling to think of anything she
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn’t this just
another way of saying you don’t believe the proffered
justification? In other words, the -- the trial judge
made a credibility determination that that was the
reason, the person rolled her eyes, and you’re saying,
in light of the other explanations, you think the
prosecutor is just making that up.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: I -- I think two things. I
think, one, the reasonable conclusion is the prosecutor
is making it up, but even if the Court -- the Court
doesn’t need to accept that to still come to the
conclusion and say the demeanor rationale is still not
the reason for the strike. She can’t say the reason
here. She comes up with six different reasons, but
they’re all either --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you’re saying you
don’t believe it. You think there’s a different
reason, and the rolling the eyes is not the real
reason. And we have a factual determination that the
judge believes that that’s the reason or a reason. And
under the -- the statute, at least that -- that’s --
that either has to be shown to be unreasonable or,
under the State’s reason, that’s presumed to be
correct, and you have to show it by clear and
convincing evidence.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: And the Ninth Circuit
properly found that the conclusion was both
unreasonable and rebutted by clear and convincing
evidence, and it’s because none of these reasons, when
we look at the totality -- what I’m trying to say is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the -- on the --
on the eye-roll, which I thought also the -- the
prosecutor said that she turned her head. So it may
be that she was out of the vision of the -- the judge
even if he had been looking. I don’t see that you have
any evidence to rebut it. You said, well, it was
rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. There was
no evidence. There was no evidentiary hearing.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, we cited a case on
page 24 in our brief, a Third Circuit case, Riley, that
says a reviewing court’s suspicion may be raised by a
series of very weak explanations given for the strike.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There -- there’s no doubt
that the court -- or at least in my mind, that -- that
the trial court could have come out the other way. I
-- I -- you know, all of the things you say are quite
true. The question is whether the trial court had to
come out the other way, whether it was just utterly
unreasonable for the trial court to come out the way it
did. And that -- you know, that’s a -- that’s a heavy
burden. And -- and it is a messy transcript and all of
that, but I -- I find it difficult to see how -- how
you can establish that -- not only that -- that the
trial court could have come out the other way or,
indeed, maybe in your judgment, maybe in my judgment,
should have come out the other way. But you have to
establish that it’s unreasonable not to come out the
other way. And -- and I find it hard to -- to see how
you can do that when you have a transcript that relies,
in part, upon the -- you know, the rolling of the eyes
and the -- and the trial court says, I’m -- I’m willing
to give her the benefit of the doubt that that’s the
reason she did it.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, Miller-El emphasizes
that we need to view the prosecutor’s behavior
cumulatively. And again, when we look at here the --
the prosecutor coming out with one reason after another
to try to justify her strikes, consecutive strikes, of
the only two black women on this jury, there’s just
simply no credibility left to give to the demeanor
rationale even if one views that it’s --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was
another -- another. Wasn’t there another minority
woman on the -- in the jury panel?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Juror 20 Collins explains --
Mr. -- trial counsel -- defense counsel, explained at
the hearing was a person of color but not African
American. So the record shows, I believe, we have one
African American on the jury and one other minority.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now -- now, number 19 was
excused and was a black person.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: That’s correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and a woman. And if
that too had been suspicious and challenged, then you
might have had a pattern, a pattern of two people,
which could have overcome the demeanor testimony --
demeanor claim.
But I -- I think on this record that we have
to assume that there is nothing wrongful about excusing
juror 19 merely because respondent’s counsel here --
you did not pursue that. I -- I read the record as --
as telling us that so far as juror 19 is concerned,
there was an adequate reason for excusing that juror.
At least respondent’s counsel -- you have not said that
there wasn’t.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, on the State appeal,
it’s true that Collins’ attorney dropped the claim
specifically as to juror 19. But the reason the
prosecutor’s strike of juror 19 is relevant is at step
three of Batson, this Court has emphasized that the
duty of the trial judge to determine purposeful
discrimination requires an examination of all the
relevant circumstances.
JUSTICE BREYER: So what is the remedy -- the
--
remedy if we say and hold with you that prosecutors
can’t give reasons like they gave here? How is a --
what’s a prosecutor supposed to do? I mean, the
prosecutor might be moved by stereotype. Young African
American women -- of course, she tolerates drugs.
Well, not quite of course. Well -- well -- well, she
rolled her eyes. Well, at least she looked in this
direction. Well, I sort of -- maybe I’m seeing eye-
rolling here. I mean, we all understand that. But
that’s why I guess I am where I am. I -- I don’t see
what the -- I don’t see what we’re telling prosecutors
if we hold in your favor, and I don’t see how we deal
with the problem if we hold against you.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, I -- I think -- I
think the record here reinforces Your Honor’s view on
JUSTICE BREYER: But I’m asking for your
experience. You have a lot of experience as a defense
lawyer. How is this thing supposed to work?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, I -- I think if -- if
the Court allows to happen what -- what happened here,
then I think the message it could be saying to
prosecutors, is as long as you can just rifle off a
series of -- of reasons for your strike and then the
trial court latches onto one of them, taking it out of
the context of the plausibility of all the other
strikes, then we’re going to allow this type of behavior
to continue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: This prosecutor presumably
appears before this judge on other occasions, and --
and don’t you think we -- we can give some weight to
the fact that the judge is there, sees the woman, sees
what she’s saying, and -- and can judge better than we
can whether she’s making this up or just -- just is --
is somewhat confused, especially since, as -- as I
think the General pointed out, we’re dealing with a
kind of determination that is usually instinctive on
the part of trial counsel. There’s just something
about this, you know, and you move to strike. I’m not
sure it springs into your mind, at the time you -- you
move to strike, the precise reason. Then somebody asks
you later, why was it? Why was it? There was just
something about that person I didn’t like. I know it
wasn’t the race. That had nothing to do with it. Now,
what was it? And then -- then you have to recreate a
-- a rational process that, in fact, never occurred.
It was an instinctive process more than a rational one.
So I’m -- I’m not particularly upset by -- by
seeing counsel flounder about in -- in trying to come
up with what the right reason was. I think it’s
probably pretty hard to figure out.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: First of all, there’s
nothing in the record to indicate that this prosecutor
had appeared many times before this trial judge.
Another point is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, she might in the
future, if she’s got a job as a prosecutor in this
court. So she’s certainly going to be concerned with
her reputation, her integrity before the court.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: That’s right, but I guess
what I’m trying to say is it’s not that the judge said,
you know, Ms. Prosecutor, you’ve appeared before me
many times and I’m willing to give you the benefit of
the doubt because I know the way you are. We have
nothing like that here.
Also, as far as it being instinctive, Batson
and Miller-El require the prosecutor to give the
reasons and stand and fall on the plausibility of those
reasons. And -- and here --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I’m saying that it’s hard.
That’s all. And -- and that you can understand why
somebody would flop around because, at the time the
strike is made, I’m -- I’m not sure it’s always an
entirely rational rather than instinctive action.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: I understand, but what’s
significant here is when she is flopping around, the
reason she comes up with -- she says gender. It’s
patently unconstitutional and discriminatory. We have
youth, and then she says, well, it’s not that they’re
younger. Other young people on the jury. It’s not
that I don’t want young people. And she doesn’t strike
juror 15.
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let me -- let me
ask you as a -- as a response to -- to the kind of the
incoherent flopping around argument, let me ask you
what your position would be if the record were
different in the following respect.
Let’s assume the record is just what it is up
until that final paragraph or so in which the judge
rules. And instead of doing what he did in this case,
the judge says the following two things. He says,
number one, I didn’t see the eye-rolling, but I accept
counsel’s representation of fact that the eye-rolling
went on and I certainly understand the -- the
significance of that. So I’m going to take that as a
fact.
Number two, even though counsel has withdrawn
the -- the sort of the general claim of youth and so
on, I understand counsel still to be saying this is a
person without any manifest ties to the community and
-- and that suggests a certain looseness of
responsibility.
And based upon the eye-rolling and based upon
the lack of ties to the community, I think counsel had
a race-neutral basis for the -- for the strike that was
made, and for that reason, I’m going to overrule the
Batson challenge with respect to number 16.
What would your position be?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, that -- that would be
a -- a tougher case for us because we would have an
explicit ruling --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: -- of what actually
happened.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What would your position be?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: I still think that in this
case, given the entire context and all the other
reasons given, including the gender reason, that it
would still -- that those demeanor and youth reasons
would still not be persuasive looking at the context --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So you would say that those
two conclusions on the part of the court were
unreasonable?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: On -- on this record, yes,
given all the other reasons we have given by the
prosecutor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you would say
you’ve established that by clear and convincing
evidence?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: I would because when we go
through the comparative juror analysis and look at the
record of the whole, we see that the reasons given, for
example, on youth are not used for similarly situated
white jurors.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but number 6 was a
young white -- young white male, I believe, and he was
excused on the ground of youth. So it’s consistent.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: 6 was different in that he
was unemployed, in fact, had never been employed, and
also he had an uncle who was a recovered alcoholic, and
that made him quite different from juror 16.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What’s wrong with the
explanation, as far as youth is concerned, is that she
didn’t want to across-the-board strike young people,
but she just wanted to come up with a jury that had
dominantly older people. So that wouldn’t mean that
she’s withdrawing youth. It’s just that she’s saying
it isn’t an absolute with me.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, I think she’s also
admitting that youth wasn’t a reason because she’s
saying there are other young people on the jury, and
the significant question here --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what’s -- one -- one
point could be I don’t want too many young people, so
I’m going to exercise some peremptories to make sure
that the jury is dominantly older people. What’s wrong
with that?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: What’s wrong with that here
is the question is why is she using that rationale
against the young black juror and not the -- the young
white jurors on the panel? How come she’s seeking to
achieve the balance by striking juror 16?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, she did. Number 6
was white. Right?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And youth was a factor
there. There may have been other factors, but youth
was certainly a factor in that case.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And this one rolled her
eyes.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Right, but when we look at
the totality of the reasons, which include looking at
the way she treated juror 19, we have the lack of ties
in the community --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Juror 19 -- you just
said earlier the fact that the one juror’s uncle had an
alcohol problem was -- was a legitimate factor. Juror
’s daughter had a -- a cocaine problem and this was a
cocaine case. Isn’t that a perfectly legitimate reason
for exercising a peremptory with respect to a juror?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: The significance of the
treatment of juror 19 is, right out of the box, the
prosecutor is coming up with reasons that she says
apply to both 16 and 19, the only two black women on
the jury. And these are very disparate women, and
they’re different in age and occupation status, the
number of children they have, and people they -- who
are close to them who have substance abuse problems.
And right out of the box, the prosecutor is saying that
both of them are disqualified from jury service because
they’re both young, when juror 19, in fact, was a
retired grandmother.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that was so
obviously a slip, and Judge Hall pointed that out in
her dissent. Defense counsel too confused -- was
confused on the numbers. Obviously, it -- the -- the
prosecutor wasn’t trying to say a grandmother is going
to be excused -- is going to be struck because she’s
young.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: I respectfully disagree that
it was a mistake. Her answer -- her response that
juror 16 and 19 are both young came immediately in
response to the court’s request that the prosecutor
justify her peremptory strikes of judge 16 -- jurors 16
and 19.
And then later on, when the judge said that
gender was not going to cut it, the prosecutor said,
well, it’s not really gender. She backtracked to
youth, and she said what is important, their youth is
important. And she could only have been referring to
and 19 at that point because there was no claim that
juror 6 was being excluded because of his gender.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you say the same
thing about the defense counsel confusing jurors 16 and
on page 9? The bottom of page 9, it seems to me Ms.
-- Ms. Nachman is confusing juror 19 with 16. They’re
talking about 16 and 6, and then Ms. Nachman ends by
talking about juror 19. That seems to me clearly to
mean number 16.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, I’m -- I -- I don’t
think so because on the next page she continues
discussing juror 19 at the top of page 10.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I don’t think
it’s a necessary reading.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe I’m -- what --
what is the inference you try to draw from the
treatment of juror 19? That the prosecutor wants to --
was striking people on the basis of their race or that
she had better reasons for 19 than 16?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: No, no. The conclusion is
that she was striking jurors on the basis of the race,
that she is using --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then what do you
do with the fact that juror 19’s daughter had a cocaine
problem and this was a cocaine case? That doesn’t seem
to be -- that’s not a race-based reason. That’s seems
to me to be a good reason.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Right. We’re not
challenging the strike of 19 per se. What we’re saying
is that the prosecutor’s reasons she gave for 19 are
important in trying to determine whether she is
intentionally discriminating in striking juror 16. And
the fact that she is lumping the two jurors together,
not treating them as individuals, but treating them, in
fact, stereotypically by saying that all -- that three
of these reasons apply to both of them, when the record
clearly shows that they don’t apply to juror 19, it
shows -- it shows the discriminatory behavior.
The -- the Attorney General said that this
case is unlike Miller-El, but I’d just like to
emphasize certainly here we have a petitioner who was
representing himself pro se and he did not present
extra-record evidence of a -- of a history of
discrimination.
But the case-specific evidence is similar to
Miller-El in important respects, and Miller-El requires
relief in this case.
First -- first of all, three of the reasons
given here for the strikes pertain just as well to non-
black jurors as to the black jurors, and that’s youth,
tolerance, and single.
Here, as in Miller-El, we have the district
attorney scrambling from rationale to rationale and,
when called on, one of the reasons shifting to another.
And here, the district attorney did not ask
questions on grounds later used to justify the strike.
Now, clearly here, it’s a judge-conducted voir dire,
but the attorneys were allowed to ask the judge to ask
different questions -- to ask that the judge ask
additional questions. And here, at the conclusion of
the voir dire of jurors 1 through 17, the -- the
prosecutor asked the judge to ask four additional
questions. Three of them were to the panel generally
and one specifically about juror 8. But the prosecutor
never asked that any additional questions be asked of
juror 16 before she struck her.
If I could turn briefly to the State’s
Jackson v. Virginia argument, unless there’s any
additional questions on the Batson claim. The State’s
claim that (d)(2) and (e)(1) incorporate the Jackson
sufficiency of the evidence test is contrary to the
plain terms of (d)(2) and (e)(1) and this Court’s cases
construing those provisions. And the State still
hasn’t cited a single case prescribing a Jackson type
of review, and courts have been construing AEDPA for
over 9 years now. That should be the end of the line
for the State’s argument.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with
the argument that your reading of the two sections
means that (e)(1) would only apply in a very small
number of cases, and it’s obvious that Congress was
trying to tighten the habeas review procedures?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Our argument is based on the
-- the structure and text of the statute and -- and the
fact that the clear and convincing requirement is tied
to the presumption of correctness.
I’d like to emphasize that the Ninth Circuit
in this case did apply both (d)(2) and (e)(1), as this
Court did in Miller-El, and found that Collins has
satisfied both standards. So I just want to emphasize
for the Court, even if it does not agree with us on our
construction of (e)(1), that relief is still
appropriate in this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in a sense, the
standards perhaps ought to be reversed. When you hear
the evidence, which is what you do under (e)(1), that
is when you’ve determined -- should determine whether
it’s unreasonable. You should presume that it’s
correct before you decide whether you’re going to hear.
So you could argue that they should be --
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Right. I -- I think our
argument is based on the fact that we have the
presumption of correctness as part of (e), which is the
fact development procedure in Federal court.
The State’s Jackson argument, I’d just like
to highlight, is irreconcilable with what this Court
said in Miller-El I, and what it did in Miller-El II.
In Miller-El I, this Court stated that Federal courts
can disagree with State court credibility
determinations and, when guided by AEDPA, determine
that the conclusion is unreasonable or its factual
premise rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.
In Miller-El II, this Court disagreed with
the State court credibility determination and granted
habeas relief even though the significance of some of
the habeas petitioner’s evidence was open to judgment
calls.
By contrast, this Court stated in Schlup v.
Delo, that the assessment of credibility is generally
beyond the scope of review in Jackson.
And in the Crenshaw case cited by the State,
the Court explained that under Jackson, the test for
rejecting evidence as incredible is extraordinarily
stringent and is met, for example, only when the
testimony given is describing facts that are physically
impossible.
This Court couldn’t have granted relief in
Miller-El if it construed (d)(2) or (e)(1) as
containing the Jackson test, and the State’s approach
would effectively bar habeas relief whenever a habeas
petitioner challenged a credibility determination.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that (d)(2) or
(e)(1) is the -- is the stricter requirement? I’m
really not sure which of the two. Don’t you think it
-- it might be possible to show, by clear and
convincing evidence, that the State court decision was
-- factual decision was wrong, but you, nonetheless, do
not show that it was unreasonable? In other words, it
may well be that (d)(2) is -- is the more severe one.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: I -- I think they’re
different standards. (e)(1) is a -- a standard of
proof, and (d)(2) is a standard of assessing a prior
court’s assessment of the facts.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if I might ask. You
have no objection to our unsealing the joint appendix,
volume 2.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: No, we don’t.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: If I could briefly sum up.
In Powers v. Ohio, this Court said that the Fourteenth
Amendment mandate, that racial discrimination be
eliminated from all acts and proceedings of the State,
is most compelling in the judicial system.
Here, the district attorney struck two of
three African American jurors, including both black
women, where a black defendant was facing a sentence of
years to life in a three-strikes case for possessing
.1 grams of cocaine.
One of the reasons given by the district
attorney is patently unconstitutional: gender. And
all the other reasons are either contradicted or
unsupported by the record.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you, by any means -- you
don’t contend, though, the fact that she did rely, in
part, on an unconstitutional reason is a sufficient
reason for sustaining a Batson type challenge?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: In this case, it’s very
significant that she relied on the unconstitutional
reason.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But you have not argued
that that would be a sufficient reason for setting
aside the verdict.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: This claim was not raised in
State court as a gender challenge as opposed to race,
if I’m answering the Court’s question.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it would have
had merit if you had made that argument?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: Absolutely, and I think it
has merit here because it’s -- it’s a reason the
district attorney admitted that was motivating her
strike. It’s -- it’s patently unconstitutional and it
taints every other reason she gave.
JUSTICE THOMAS: Counsel, is there anything
in the record to alert us to the race of the
prosecutor?
MR. DROZDOWSKI: There is not besides her
name.
JUSTICE THOMAS: Would it make any
difference? There seemed to be some suggestion that
there are stereotypes at play in these Batson cases.
MR. DROZDOWSKI: No.
Equal protection mandates relief in this
case, and AEDPA does not prevent it.
I respectfully request that the Court affirm
the judgment of the Ninth Circuit. Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
General Lockyer, you have 4 minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM W. LOCKYER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LOCKYER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
First, with respect to juror 19, I think it’s
the best clear way to see what the Ninth Circuit did
and what Collins continues to do, which is to
substitute their reading, their inferences, and then
conclude that anyone that disagrees is unreasonable.
Juror 19 -- if you read page 5, it’s clearly
a slip of the tongue where she accidentally is
comparing the two young people, 6, and says 19.
Immediately afterward, she says 6. And the defense
counsel says, well, who is 6? She says, it’s the other
young person, the young white person that I struck.
That slip of the tongue is the heart of the
Ninth Circuit effort and analysis to do, as the
dissenters said in the en banc denial, nitpick the
record to find some circumstantial evidence to support
your view of inferences and conclusions about
reasonableness. I think that partly makes the case and
especially with a statute where deference is so owed.
The gender claim is ambiguous, but it was not
a challenge based solely on race and the circuits are
split on the mixed motive question, as Justice Stevens
indicated. Second, Third, Fourth, Eighth, and
Eleventh, and in one opinion in the Ninth, they’ve
addressed mixed motives generally saying your clearly
established Federal law says that it has to be solely
based on race. That’s the current test in the
standard.
We raised Jackson and -- Jackson v. Virginia
just because of the Lockyer v. Andrade case in which
the Court indicates that clear error, when we talk
about objective reasonableness in understanding (d)(2)
and (d)(1) in the case of Andrade, that it’s more than
clear error. So we’re trying to figure out, well,
what’s more than clear error. We don’t know what it
might be other than seeing the evidence in the light
most favorable to the trier of fact.
And finally, with respect to youth, clearly
it’s reasonable for a judge to look at the demeanor of
the DA who’s saying again and again and again it’s a
young person, unmarried, no ties in the community. One
of the things we didn’t talk about is the DA who’s from
Los Angeles knows that that juror lives in Inglewood.
Now, there are different kind of neighborhoods in
Inglewood, but a lot of them are neighborhoods with
lots of drug dealing, and he might think or she might
think, in this instance, it shows naivete to answer the
question that there’s never drug dealing in my
neighborhood.
Well, for all those concerns, they’re not
implausible, they’re not fantastic, as you know from
the decisions that the reasons can be superstitious.
They can be silly.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But, you’re coming up
with still more reasons than the prosecutor came up
with.
MR. LOCKYER: Well, they’re just the ones in
the record, Your Honor. So I wanted to make sure the
Court was aware of them.
But that’s basically our contention, that
deference was owed and the Ninth Circuit didn’t respect
that deference to trial judge that we rely on for
credibility determinations.
If there are no questions, thank you very
much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the
