CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll now hear
argument in Lincoln Property v. Roche.
Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
This is a routine diversity case that went
seriously awry in the court of appeals. The
original defendants in -- named in the complaint,
Petitioners State of Wisconsin Investment Board,
which I'll refer to as SWIB, and Lincoln Property
Company, are completely proper and diverse parties.
SWIB owned the apartment complex, and Lincoln
managed it through agents. The Fourth Circuit,
nonetheless, embarked on a search for affiliates of
Lincoln that it thought would be more appropriate
party defendants, what the court deemed, quote,
"real parties in interest."
The Fourth Circuit's holdings are
fundamentally flawed, in two respects. First,
because the named defendants are proper parties, the
court erred in holding that Lincoln had not carried
its burden of proof by failing to establish that
some non-named putative defendants might possibly
destroy complete diversity, and that the remedy for
such a possibility was dismissal of the action from
Federal court. Second, the court erroneously
engrafted a, quote, "very close nexus" requirement
onto the test for require -- for determining the
citizenship of a limited partnership.
Now, with respect to the first issue, a
number of black-letter legal principles govern a
court's consideration of non-named parties.
Let's start with the statutory text. The
diversity statute, at section 1332(a), talks about
civil actions, and a "civil action" is defined as
the naming of a plaintiff and a defendant. A civil
action does not encompass those that are not named
in the lawsuit. That language is tracked in the
removal statute, section 1441(a), which also speaks
of civil actions, and in -- mirrored in 1441(b),
which says that a defendant may remove, where it is
properly joined and served.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought (b)
simply enacted a special necessary condition when
you had a local defendant. I thought it was not an
eligibility provision. I thought it was a
limitation provision.
MR. FREDERICK: It is, Justice Souter, but
what -- my argument is that that language, properly
joined and served, simply tracks the civil-action
requirement under the original diversity statute, as
well as the removal provision of 1441(a). But what
the court --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's consistent
with it, but I -- it seems to me that it's a bit of
a stretch to say that anyone who is properly joined
and served, at least in a formal sense, is,
therefore, the only person who may be considered in
a -- in a diversity inquiry.
MR. FREDERICK: What the court of appeals
did, and where we think it got off track, was it
took the -- to -- the phrase "parties in interest,"
and it -- and it took cases from this Court that
have used the phrase "real parties in interest" to
determine what are proper party plaintiffs, and it
used that concept on the defendant's side of the
ledger. And none of the cases from this Court talk
about "real parties in interest" as being
defendants. The explanation given by the court for
doing it on the plaintiff's side is to ensure that a
defendant is not going to be subjected to multiple
suits. But there are many purposes --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, I take it your
answer to Justice Souter is yes. In other words, if
the mistake that the court made was relying on
41(b), it was a similar mistake for you, in your
opening brief, to put such weight on that language
in 1441(b).
MR. FREDERICK: Our position, Your Honor,
is that the phrase "parties in interest" -- we were
seeking to find out where the court could have
applied that phraseology on the defendant's side.
And the only place that we could find, in the
statutes or the rules, was in 1441(b) and the
explanation for removal, that we were not a "proper
party in interest." And that's why we focused on that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, what
about cases where a plaintiff sues two defendants --
one is diverse, and the other is not diverse -- and
there is a motion by the defendants to dismiss for
want of diversity? The plaintiff then says, "Oh,
but only one of those defendants is the 'real-party
whatever,' and I can drop the other one, because the
other one is not the 'real party in interest'"?
Now, that's a situation where courts, even if this
court has never had that problem, have said, "If the
second defendant, the non-diverse defendant, is a
'real party,' you can't get rid of the case that
way, but if it's not -- if it's not, you can keep
the -- just drop it and keep the case going against
the 'real party in interest.'" There are such
cases.
MR. FREDERICK: There are, Justice
Ginsburg. And the analysis goes to whether or not -
- how far along in the proceeding the litigation has
occurred before the plaintiff makes that choice. Of
course, a plaintiff can voluntarily drop defendants,
without any consequences, and the courts have fairly
uniformly held that it -- that it is no
jurisdictional bar for a plaintiff to drop a non-
diverse defendant in order to ensure that diversity
would be present. Had this complaint been brought
in Federal court, there is no doubt that the court
would have had original jurisdiction, because, on
the face of the complaint, the two named defendants
were completely diverse.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ah, but the plaintiff
said, "This is a complicated real estate business,
and I want to discover whether there is -- whether
the 'true defendant' is a Virginia citizen, as I
am." So, on the face of it, it looks like there's
complete diversity, but, in fact, the diverse
defendant is hiding the "real party." I think
that's the position that the plaintiff was taking.
MR. FREDERICK: And that position is
incorrect, both as a factual matter and as a legal
matter. As a factual matter, Lincoln is a
completely proper party. Its name is on the lease.
It was the employer of Mr. Roche, who was one of
the plaintiffs in the suit. It issued the mold
policies that are at issue in the case. All of its
advertising is alleged to have been fraudulent in
the original complaint. And it was the director and
manager of the agents whose acts were alleged to
have been negligent here. There's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The plaintiff --
MR. FREDERICK: -- no question --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the plaintiff points
to two offices of the defendant, who's -- the
defendant is described by defendant as a Texas
corporation -- but there was one witness -- Chaney,
was it? -- who said that Lincoln is not a
corporation. It is a partnership. No corporate
board.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, Mr. Chaney's
testimony has to be viewed in contact -- in context,
Justice Ginsburg. He was not called as a 30(b)(6)
witness as a corporate -- for a corporate form and
structure. The testimony that was being elicited
was to see whether Lincoln had other entities and
ownership of properties in Virginia so that they
could attempt to prove that there was a problem that
the parent company, Lincoln Property Company, knew
about. There was a high degree of imprecision in
the deposition questions, and it's fairly clear, I
think, that the lawyer and the witness did not
understand what each other were talking about. Yet
in the discovery process, not a single question was
presented that would get at the organizational
structure of Lincoln. There was not any attempt to
get behind the management documents between SWIB and
Lincoln Property. It was one very small snippet of
a deposition which has been taken out of context
and, we would submit, blown out of proportion by the
Respondents in their submissions in this case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they thought they
got closer with a witness named Franzen, who was a
Virginia resident, and who also described Lincoln as
a partnership, and himself as a partner.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Ginsburg, as
the Real Estate Roundtable brief demonstrates, and
is unrebutted, the real-estate industry operates
through many very complicated structures for
perfectly legitimate finance and tax-related
reasons. And Mr. Franzen is a partner in some
deals, but the testimony that was provided in a
declaration -- and it is appended to our reply brief
-- demonstrates that Mr. Franzen was not a partner
in any deal that had anything to do with the
Westfield Village Apartments.
But what the court of appeals did was, it
erected a burden of proof that said that the
defendant has to prove a negative, that there is not
some affiliate corporation out there that is a
citizen of the Commonwealth that would be existing
to destroy diversity. And that type of burden, to
prove a negative, has never been authorized in this
Court's cases. Rather, what this Court's cases have
held is that, as the masters of their complaint,
plaintiffs have an opportunity to plead whichever
defendants they want to try to prove their
allegations against. If they want to try to prove
Federal claims, this Court has held that that kind
of case can be removed. If it wants to plead around
Federal claims, this Court's cases have said that
that would be respected, as well.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frederick,
earlier you made the point that Lincoln was a proper
"real party in interest." I take it that's not
critical to your position. Your argument would be
the same if they weren't a real party in interest,
wouldn't it?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, we don't think,
Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, that the "real party
in interest" analysis even applies on the
defendant's side, but it is -- it would not apply
to this extent. It's not for the courts, once they
have a proper defendant, to be searching outside the
record for possible jurisdictional spoilers once
jurisdiction has been established. And this court's
cases --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if they -- if
they don't have a proper defendant, they should do
that?
MR. FREDERICK: If they do -- if there is
no proper defendant, then I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I presume, then --
MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. It --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that the
plaintiff loses, not that you get to have the court
find the proper defendant for the plaintiff.
MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. It would
be a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, where there is no
defendant who would be liable to the plaintiff.
But what the court of appeals did here
was, it imposed an obligation on the defendants
that, in effect, confuses the obligations that are
in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, which looks
at whether there are necessary or indispensable
parties. And what the court did was, in effect, to
take an unnamed affiliated entity to Lincoln and
treat it as the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick --
MR. FREDERICK: -- functional equivalent
of an --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- will you just clarify
one thing for me? Did the defendant ever take the
position in this litigation, in discovery or
anywhere along the line, that they sued their own
defendant?
MR. FREDERICK: No. In fact, in their
answer, Justice Stevens, they admitted that they
were the manager of the apartment, that they had run
it through their agents. They acknowledged that it
was their policies that were in effect. There
wouldn't have been a basis that would have survived
rule 11 that would have given Lincoln Property
Company a basis on which not to defend the lawsuit.
And so, to that extent, we think it's quite clear
that they are a proper party defendant.
We've always taken the position that if we
are found liable, we would pay a judgment. The
issue is that we don't think we're liable, because
we think that the allegations in the complaint are
completely baseless. And that's what the district
court found when it held, on summary judgment, that
there was not a dispute of fact as to the core
allegations of the complaint.
Returning to the point I was trying to
make about rule 19, there is a mechanism for the
courts to consider whether there are indispensable
parties. And what the court did here was to take a
rule 19 kind of inquiry -- Is a non-named defendant
really an indispensable party, such that dismissal
of the action is warranted? -- and to engraft that
onto a jurisdictional inquiry. But the reason why
we have the Rules of Civil Procedure is, of course,
to follow them. And what the Fourth Circuit did
here was, it took that kind of analysis, but it
didn't follow the standards that the courts have set
out for applying rule 19 properly.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, plaintiff
certainly wouldn't want to say there's an
indispensable party missing, I take it, because then
that would put the plaintiff out of court. The
plaintiff is arguing that there's another defendant
who should be in here.
MR. FREDERICK: And, Justice Ginsburg,
they never sought to name or join that other
possible defendant. They never brought a joinder
motion. They never even conducted discovery as to
whether or not there was another possible defendant
that might be affiliated. And their theory of
liability made it unnecessary, because their theory
of liability was that Lincoln Property Company, the
parent, is responsible for all the acts of its
agents. And had they really wanted to be in Federal
court, they could have found plenty of Virginia
citizens that they could have sued. They could have
sued the plumber, they could have sued the installer
of a -- heating and air-conditioning equipment, they
could have sued the general contractors. There are
a lot of people they could have sued if they were
that intent on staying in Federal court. But,
instead, they made a tactical choice to sue the
deepest pockets. And the deepest pockets happened
to be out-of-State citizens that have a right under
the statutes to remove the case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And because you
represent the removing defendant, it is true, is it
not, that the removing defendant has the burden of
showing that proper diversity exists?
MR. FREDERICK: And we readily satisfied
that, both on the face of the complaint, which
identified Lincoln Property Company as a Texas
corporation, and in the remand notice, which
identified its principal place of business as Texas.
Even the court of appeals had no problem calling it
a "Texas parent," because the corporation documents,
which are part of the record, amply demonstrated
that Lincoln Property Company is, in fact, a Texas
corporation and satisfies those requisites under the
diversity jurisdiction provision.
The -- instead, what the Fourth Circuit
has done is to erect a standardless forum that will
increase litigation over jurisdiction by inviting
courts to make inquiry about parties and entities
that are not named in the lawsuit, solely for the
purpose of determining whether or not there are
jurisdictional spoilers.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- I know you
contend that's not the case, but let's say there is
a in-State subsidiary that's completely responsible
for all the challenged actions, and the in-State
plaintiff sues an -- only the out-of-State parent.
What happens in that case?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, what the ninth
circuit, in a -- in an opinion by then-Judge Kennedy
that we have cited, called Simpson -- said you
respect the plaintiff's allegations. If the
plaintiff wants to sue the parent, and the parent is
an out-of-State corporation, the plaintiff is the
master of the complaint. And, in the Simpson case,
the Ninth Circuit held that it was completely proper
to remain in Federal court, even though it was
obvious to all that there was a subsidiary that was
an in-State subsidiary that, if it had been sued,
would be non-diverse. So, we think that's the
proper answer, Mr. Chief Justice.
Now, if I could turn to the second issue
that we have prevented -- presented, that concerns
how one would treat EQR, which is the management
agent of Lincoln Property Company. We read the
Fourth Circuit's opinion as engrafting onto this
Court's test in the Carden case an additional
requirement that, in addition to the citizens of --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, would
you clarify one thing for me? I don't know how we
even get to the second question, about partnership.
If you're right that Lincoln is a corporation --
it's a Texas corporation, with its principal place
of business in Texas, end of case; it's the only
named defendant -- so, how do we get to something
about a partnership?
MR. FREDERICK: If you agree with us on
question one, Justice Ginsburg, reversal is the
appropriate disposition, and the Court need not
reach question two.
We would submit, however, that, because
the error is so egregious and leads to the
difficulties that have been outlined by the Real
Estate Roundtable for nationwide business entities,
that the Court certainly ought to say that this was
error, as well, or at least to vacate that part of
the judgment, as well. And the reason is, in the
Carden case, what the Court held was that the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I don't
understand it. We wouldn't vacate the judgment in
part. If we reversed, --
MR. FREDERICK: No, but you --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that's the end of
MR. FREDERICK: -- expressed disapproval
with this very-close-nexus standard by which the
Fourth Circuit attempted to engraft onto the normal
citizenship rules for a limited partnership the
notion that its citizenship could be deemed, if its
activities had a very close nexus with the State --
and I'm referring now to the passage, Justice
Ginsburg, that's at pages 16(a) to 17(a) of the
petition appendix. There are four page -- four
sentences on those two pages that capture the error
of the Fourth Circuit. And, just below the bottom,
it says -- it says, "The real party in interest owns
land and operates a substantial part of its business
in Virginia, thus establishing a very close nexus
with the Commonwealth."
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but, Mr.
Frederick, before that -- you know, read back -- the
court -- the Fourth Circuit has said, "It appears
that the real and substantial party in interest is
this Virginia subsidiary, be it a partnership, be it
a corporation."
So, it's -- the thing about nexus is not
self-standing. The court is positing that there is
a Virginia corporation or a Virginia partnership in
the picture, and then says, "And given that, not
only is it -- is it a Virginia entity, but it's got
this close nexus because of -- it's operating
substantially there, as well."
MR. FREDERICK: Well, all of the evidence,
Justice Ginsburg, in the record was that EQR was a
Delaware limited partnership, where it was
registered, composed of a Texas corporation as its
general partner, and a limited partner that had two
partners that were, themselves, Texas corporations.
So, the evidence in the record established that
EQR, which was the entity the Fourth Circuit was
alluding to here, was, in fact, a Texas citizen, and
its attempt to confuse the record by suggesting that
there was a way to look at the citizenship of that
entity through its, quote, "very close nexus with
the State," we submit, is also in error.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct, though,
this entity we're talking about is not a party to
the case?
MR. FREDERICK: That's correct.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So --
MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, Justice
Stevens, and that's where we think that the Fourth
Circuit went off.
I'd just like to make one more point
before saving the remainder of my time for rebuttal,
and that is that if the Fourth Circuit was correct,
SWIB is a critical party here, which the respondents
never deny. It is the owner of the apartment
building. It is a completely proper defendant for
the acts of negligence in -- and other wrongdoings
that they allege. But they never mention that party
in their brief. So, if the Fourth Circuit is
correct that Lincoln, the parent, really is nominal
under this Court's decisions, its citizenship should
be completely disregarded. That was the holding of
this Court in Walden versus Skinner in 1879. On the
other hand, if a Lincoln affiliate at that stage in
the litigation is a proper defendant, but non-
diverse, the Fourth Circuit should have dismissed
it, under Horn versus Lockhart, which was decided in
73.
If the Court has no further questions,
thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Frederick.
Mr. Joseph.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY P. JOSEPH
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. JOSEPH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The judgment of the Fourth Circuit should
be affirmed for two reasons, one of which responds
to a question that the Chief Justice asked, and that
is that Lincoln Property Company was not a real
party to the controversy.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was what?
MR. JOSEPH: Was not a real party to the
controversy.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did you name
it, in the complaint, as the defendant?
MR. JOSEPH: Trial counsel named it,
because that was the understanding that he had. It
turned out, as Lincoln proved on remand, that it had
abandoned the apartment management business in 1991.
And that's at page 239 of the joint appendix.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you'll be left
without -- if you've named the wrong defendant,
then you have a suit against no defendant. It seems
to me you are automatically dismissed. You didn't
substitute another defendant.
MR. JOSEPH: You're correct, Your Honor,
and that's because Lincoln said that it was the
manager. Lincoln, in its answer, paragraphs 13,
paragraph 36, paragraph 5, said that it was the real
party in interest, when, in fact, it was not. And
that's what's led to the problem that we find
ourselves in, because when you have a non-real party
to the controversy, jurisdiction is determined by
the salient jurisdictional --
JUSTICE BREYER: I've never heard of that.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: I thought, if you sue A,
and then it turns out A doesn't own the building,
well, then you've got to sue B.
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, that is --
JUSTICE BREYER: And you didn't sue B.
MR. JOSEPH: We didn't sue B. We didn't
know B existed.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's too bad,
that, unfortunately, if you don't know who owns the
building, it's going to be hard for you to bring the
lawsuit. But we had, I thought, like, pages and
pages of discovery rules and -- I've never heard,
before, of a lawyer who has a -- you know, in this
kind of situation, can't find out who owns a
building there. There are records, there are all
kinds of things.
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, Lincoln
represented to the public and to the court that it
was, in fact, the manager. Discovery was, in fact,
served that would have adduced this information.
This issue came up in the reply brief, so it's not
addressed in our brief, but if any of your clerks
would care to look at the Fourth Circuit's
supplemental appendix, it --
JUSTICE BREYER: I've looked through the
appendix, actually. I read the joint appendix,
insofar as the opinion cited it. And it cited, in
the opinion, several -- five factors -- and I guess
there are no others, though you can bring them out
if there were -- that supported you. And the only
two that seemed to say that it had something to do -
- that seemed to have anything at all to do with
suggesting that there was no diversity -- was Mr.
Fred Chaney, which said that it was a partnership
and not a company. I read that. That didn't seem
to me to be what he said. And then somebody called
Mr. LeBeau, who said that Franzen is a senior vice
president and -- a Virginia resident -- and partner
in Lincoln Property. So, I looked up that, and it
was on, like, page 273 and, I think, 173 there. And
they asked Mr. LeBeau, and he says, "Lincoln
operates through many different structures, and I
don't know what they were using here." Am I right -
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- or did I misread it?
MR. JOSEPH: -- you read that absolutely
correctly. There --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So --
MR. JOSEPH: -- are other --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- what is the evidence?
MR. JOSEPH: There are -- there is other
evidence on that issue, which I believe is a
distinct issue, but let me address that issue. In
lawyer-prepared documents that were submitted
specifically to rule 26(a)(1) disclosures and the --
and the supplemental interrogatory answers, which
we've cited in our brief, it was lawyers that
identified Mr. Franzen as a senior vice president
and partner of Lincoln Property Company, raising an
issue --
JUSTICE BREYER: Where is it in the
appendix? It said that he -- you sue person X, and
I take it the reason that you won this case in the
Fourth Circuit -- which was surprising to me -- was
that a person called Mr. Franzen, who is a resident
of Virginia, was a partner of the defendant. Now, I
would like -- and, indeed, it was a partnership of
which he was a partner. So, if a Virginia resident
is a partner of the defendant, which is a
partnership, then maybe you were right.
So, I'm interested in: What is the
evidence that Mr. Franzen was a partner of the
defendant, which is a partnership?
MR. JOSEPH: On page 179 of the joint
appendix, Your Honor, in Lincoln's supplemental
answers to interrogatories, Mr. Franzen is
identified in this affirmation as a senior vice
president and partner of Lincoln Property Company.
As I said, there are two issues. What is Lincoln's
characterization?
On the next page, page 181, in the
supplemental initial disclosures, Mr. Franzen is
again, in the middle of the page, identified as a
partner of Lincoln Property Company.
JUSTICE BREYER: What page --
MR. JOSEPH: I'm sorry, that --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- is that? Is that a --
MR. JOSEPH: -- that was joint appendix,
page 181.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's better than
what is in the opinion. What is it? 181.
MR. JOSEPH: 181, Your Honor. The prior
one was 179. There was --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how about joint
appendix 239 and 275, both of which say that Franzen
was not a partner in any entity responsible for
managing the apartments in question?
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, that evidence was
also in the record. The Fourth Circuit was not
comfortable that Mr. Franzen was being entirely
candid by not identifying which partnerships, in
fact, he was involved in. And I would note, Your
Honor, that this paragraph does not identify any
entity that actually managed the apartment building.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Joseph, I --
MR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- I thought we had to
decide whether an unnamed private party should be
considered for jurisdictional purposes.
MR. JOSEPH: Correct.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And do you have any
case supporting that proposition?
MR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor. I'd cite
two cases, in particular, for a real-party-to-the-
controversy defendant, where his citizenship is
disregarded, even though he's named: Barney versus
City of Baltimore, 73 U.S. 580, and Little against
Giles, 118 U.S. 596.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- it sounds to
me -- if I understood your answer correctly, you're
talking about cases in which the named party
citizenship is disregarded.
MR. JOSEPH: Correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Where the question is,
Should an unnamed party citizenship "be" regarded?
MR. JOSEPH: Absolutely, Your Honor. And
that is the issue that we find in the Fourth
Circuit. The Fourth Circuit found that Lincoln
Property Company was a nominal defendant.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then there's no
defendant.
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, they defended the
case. And we'd submit that, on the basis of Barney
and Little, that what one does -- on the basis of
the State Highway Commission case, when you have
someone who is serving as a surrogate for another,
you look to the jurisdictional characteristics of
the other; otherwise, he can, by coming in to
defend, obtain a Federal forum to which he is
otherwise not entitled.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but he didn't come
in to defend; you pulled him in to defend.
MR. JOSEPH: It --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And the problem that I
have with your position is, I don't know of anything
in the record that indicates that he wasn't ready to
defend, that he wouldn't have -- or it wasn't ready
to defend, that it wouldn't have paid the judgment,
that you could have -- could not have gotten, from
the party you named, all the relief that you were
asking for.
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, it was definitely
a party to the controversy. We believe that the
point of the "real party to the controversy"
doctrine is that every party doesn't fall in that
category, and that is what the focus --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But so far as the
Fourth Circuit -- tell me if I'm wrong here -- it
sounds to me that the Fourth Circuit took the
following position, that for purposes of determining
diversity, it is not enough to name a principal who
may be liable for the acts of subsidiaries, without
naming the subsidiary, or, if you name a -- I'm
mixing up principal and corporation --
MR. JOSEPH: Understood.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- principal and --
corporate parent and subsidiary, or principal and
business agent. And I don't know of any rule to the
effect that, for diversity purposes, a plaintiff
simply cannot choose to sue the parent, or to sue
the principal.
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, the facts, as
you've stated them, I believe, are not the facts in
this record.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Where would I be
wrong?
MR. JOSEPH: And let me explain. It's
certainly true that Lincoln identifies, at page 96
of the cert petition appendix, a chart of entities
that are salient. The most notable omission from
the chart is the relationship of any of those
entities to Lincoln. There is no evidence as to
what -- how attenuated that was or what the
relationship is, what indemnities existed, or
whether Lincoln actually had an interest in this
outcome. They now rely on an agency theory. That
isn't how the case was defended.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you named Lincoln
as the defendant. And I'm looking at your second
amended complaint, which says, "Lincoln," on
information and belief, "is a corporation with its
headquarters in Dallas, and it is the developer and
manager of the property." That's what you alleged
in your complaint. You allege that Lincoln was the
manager -- Lincoln, whose Texas corporation was the
manager of the property in question. Now, would you
-- you're saying that that was wrong, and you should
have sued somebody else, and the Court should cure
that for you? That's -- it's really bizarre.
MR. JOSEPH: Well, let me try to make it
less bizarre, Your Honor. What we're saying is, for
example, if I had a dispute with John Smith, the
son, who's not diverse, but I accidentally sue John
Smith, the father, who is diverse, and he comes in -
- he removes, and he comes in to defend, on the
merits, that he is not a real party to that
controversy, and that his citizenship, under the
opinions of this Court, would be measured by that of
the son to determine whether or not a Federal forum
is appropriate --
JUSTICE SCALIA: He's a real party if you
sued him.
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Just because you're going
to lose doesn't mean that he's not a real party.
MR. JOSEPH: It's one thing --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me anybody
you sue is a real party.
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, that cannot be
the case, or the "real party to the controversy"
case means that every defendant is a real party.
And it's true, in this sense, that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they -- let me stop
you on that "real party," because, as has been
pointed out, the "real party in interest" concept,
as a procedural matter, comes out of rule 17, and
it's talking about plaintiffs, that suits have to be
brought in the name of the real party so that the
defendant isn't in a situation where he's sued one
day by plaintiff A, and is not home free when
plaintiff B comes in with the identical complaint.
So, it was originally designed with, Who is the
proper party, the assignee or the assignor? That's
what real party -- that's what the concept is
familiarly about. Who is the proper plaintiff, not
defendant?
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, it's certainly
true that rule 17 only deals with plaintiffs. But
in the cases we've cited, including two I just cited
today, it applies to defendants, as well, because
rule 17 doesn't confine the limits. In Navarro, the
Court said that it articulates the same principles,
but it's not completely congruent with the "real
party to the controversy" test.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Rule 17 is about
joinder of parties; it's not about jurisdiction.
MR. JOSEPH: Exactly right. And we're
talking about the jurisdiction of the court under
the "real party to the controversy" test.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that's -- it's
something different. It's a -- it's a whole other
animal, because "real party in interest," as used in
the Federal rules, is a device -- is a joinder
device, is in the joinder rules. Now you're saying,
"Ah, but there's some other real-party concept out
there that has to do with jurisdiction."
MR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor. And I
believe the Court's opinion, in Carden, identified
"real party to the controversy" doctrine in a recent
example. I believe it was mentioned again in the
Grupo Dataflux opinion. The concept is that the
real parties to the controversy must be before the
court.
And to respond to Justice Scalia's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Carden was
about: In a partnership, does every partner's
citizenship count?
MR. JOSEPH: Correct. And in -- it
identified --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There wasn't any
question that -- that it was the right or the --
that the defendant was a wrong defendant or that --
MR. JOSEPH: The language I'm referring
to, in Carden, was in distinguishing the dissenting
opinion, in saying that if, in fact, the question
were, Which of the parties before the court should
be considered, for jurisdictional purposes? it would
be the real parties to the controversy.
JUSTICE BREYER: But to get the real
parties before the court, you have to sue them.
MR. JOSEPH: That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: And, apparently, you
didn't sue the right people until you replied to me.
Then I took your argument, because it seemed like
seven arguments, mixed up, and I took that argument
to be the following. I'm -- I, the plaintiff, sued
a defendant, who is called the Lincoln Property
Company. Now, I grant you, there is some evidence
that that defendant, the one I sued, is a Texas
corporation. One, they showed us the certificate of
incorporation, or they got a sworn statement. Two,
in my complaint, I said that's what he was.
However, there is some evidence the other
way. On page 179 and 181, we have a person named
Mr. Franzen who says, "I am the senior president, vice
president, partner for defendant Lincoln Property
Company," in which case, if that's your argument,
you're telling us -- is that your argument, that
there is some evidence the real defendant, whom I
sued, is not a corporation, despite the apparent
evidence to the contrary?
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: Rather, it is a partner,
and Mr. Franzen is a partner in it. Is that your
argument?
MR. JOSEPH: We did argue, and we do
argue, that the Fourth Circuit could reasonably
conclude, on burden-of-proof grounds, that it was
not satisfied that the Texas corporation was a
corporate entity. But the argument that I've been
using --
JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to make that
argument here, or are you going to give up on that
argument?
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, we're not
abandoning the argument, only because if you look at
the corporate entity, itself, from the joint
appendix, 243, it began as Lincoln Property number
one. If we then look at the yellow brief, in the
addendum, we have thousands of Lincoln entities. We
have no doubt there is a corporation that is a Texas
entity.
Now, our argument today is that that
entity could not step in the shoes of another
potentially non-diverse entity without at least
identifying who the -- what the jurisdictional
characteristics of that entity were. Agency was not
argued. Agency was not argued below. Lincoln said
it was the manager. The district court found, in
three opinions, Lincoln was the manager. The
plaintiffs thought they were suing the entity
managing the premises. Lincoln was not that entity.
It had abandoned that business.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if they said they
were, then it seems to me -- why don't you just hold
them to it?
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, it was not the
plaintiff's choice.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it seems very odd
that they -- they say, "We were," and you say, "Oh,
no, you weren't."
[Laughter.]
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: "We shouldn't have sued
you." Why don't you just take them at their word
and sue them?
MR. JOSEPH: There were significant
tactical advantages to Lincoln, whatever its
relationship with these entities, in being in
Federal court. The plaintiff preferred a State-
court venue where there was no Daubert and there was
no summary judgment permissible on the basis of
affidavits and deposition testimony.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it isn't up to the
court of appeals to make some kind of roving inquiry
of who would have been a better defendant. It just
seems to me the Fourth Circuit rule is totally
unworkable and unprecedented. I don't see how you
can possibly overcome that, because the plaintiff is
the master of its complaint, and it can decide who
to sue. And Lincoln was sued as a corporation, and
I don't see what business it is of a court to say,
"Oh, it should have been somebody else."
MR. JOSEPH: Let me attempt to articulate
a proposition, Your Honor, and that is that when
jurisdiction is challenged, the party asserting
jurisdiction, seeking the Federal forum, has to
defend it by proving diversity of citizenship, and
that means when its "real party to the controversy"
status is challenged, it has to adduce sufficient
evidence that it is, indeed, the real party to the
controversy.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you can move, as
a party to the case, to dismiss somebody who's sued
for some reason, but that isn't what happened here.
MR. JOSEPH: It is not what happened here.
And I would submit to you it is not what happened
here, because of a lack of candor on the part of the
defendant. Ordinarily, one would expect the
defendant to say, "Not me." In fact, this defendant
proceeded to litigate --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what if they did?
Suppose they did say, "Not me," and you proceeded
with your lawsuit.
MR. JOSEPH: They'd --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay? What would happen?
MR. JOSEPH: Your --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They would win the
judgment. Would they be the real party in that
controversy?
MR. JOSEPH: And that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course they would be.
Because you sued them. Even if they're innocent --
are you saying all innocent parties are not parties
to the controversy?
MR. JOSEPH: By no means --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think so.
MR. JOSEPH: -- Your Honor. And that was
-- that was a part of your first question, which I
want to respond to. Anybody who is a non-real party
to the controversy finds jurisdiction in the Federal
court to be able to establish that it is not the
party. But when it defends, by standing in the
shoes as a surrogate for another in order to obtain
a Federal forum, the jurisdictional characteristics
of that party are not germane. It is the
jurisdictional characteristics of the party in whose
shoes it stands.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we don't know --
MR. JOSEPH: That is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- who that party is.
Let's go back to your -- when you started
this case, you said that you would, on discovery --
this is what you said in -- at the time of your
initial complaint -- determine if there is an
additional defendant, or defendants, who should be
named as parties. What discovery did you pursue to
find out if there was an additional defendant, or
defendants, who should be named as parties?
MR. JOSEPH: Interrogatory number 3 in the
Fourth Circuit supplemental appendix, at page 35,
inquires about any person, which is defined to
include any corporate affiliate, that has any
knowledge of the tenancy of the plaintiffs. The
objections are not in the record. Again, this
issue came up in the yellow brief, but they did not
reply to that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Has any knowledge of --
MR. JOSEPH: Documents --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the what of --
MR. JOSEPH: Of the tenancy of the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.
MR. JOSEPH: -- lease relationship of the
Roches in the Westfield Village Apartment --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Joseph, can I ask
you to go back to the beginning for a second?
MR. JOSEPH: Yes, sir.
JUSTICE STEVENS: They filed a reply
brief. There are a lot of disputes about the facts.
Do you concede that the Lincoln Property Company
that you sued is a Texas corporation?
--
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, we acknowledge
there is a Texas corporation. We sued the Texas --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you acknowledge that
the corporation that you sued, Lincoln Property
Company, is a Texas corporation?
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, we do not, in the
sense that we accept the Fourth Circuit's
determination that the burden of proof to clarify
that entity's status, and the germane entity status
JUSTICE STEVENS: I understood them to be
arguing, in essence, that there's some other entity
that really is the real party in interest.
MR. JOSEPH: That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But you dispute, as a
matter of fact, that Lincoln Property Company is a
Texas corporation?
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, what we say is
that the Fourth Circuit found that there was
insufficient --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking you a --
MR. JOSEPH: -- proof of that point.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- very simple "yes" or
"no" question.
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, we do not -- we
do not walk away from the Fourth Circuit's
conclusion, so we -- we know there is a Texas
corporation. We don't know that that is --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is this corporation a
Texas corporation? The one you sued.
MR. JOSEPH: We so alleged, and they said
yes. So --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So, you say yes, it is.
MR. JOSEPH: It is. But whether or not
that is the entity, we can't be sure of, because --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'd like the -- these
are very expensive, this litigation. You're all the
way in the Supreme Court. It's costing people a lot
of money. And if there is a legal issue here, I'd
like to find out what it is.
I have exactly the same question Justice
Stevens had, which is where I started. Do you agree
that the company you sued, called Lincoln Property,
is a Texas corporation, yes or no?
MR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor, we'll --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right.
MR. JOSEPH: -- acknowledge that for this
argument.
JUSTICE BREYER: Then that's out -- fine,
that's out of the case.
The next question is -- of course you
could sue a real company, called Lincoln Property or
Jolly Fisherman, and it could turn out that that
real company is a front, that it has no real
existence, its -- all its papers and everything to
do with it is signed by a totally separate
corporation. Are you saying that's what happened
here? And if that's what happened here, which is
the real corporation and people in interest?
MR. JOSEPH: It is -- the burden-of-proof
failure that the Fourth Circuit found was that we
could not --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about
burden-of-proof failure.
MR. JOSEPH: We don't --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking you, Who is
the real corporation or person in interest that
Lincoln Property is a kind of sham or front for?
MR. JOSEPH: We do not have the answer to
that question. And that was the Fourth Circuit's
conclusion. We know that EQR is a part of that.
And that's why -- they put in an affidavit that said
that EQR was the only affiliate of Lincoln involved
in the management --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then you think --
MR. JOSEPH: -- and that's why we --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm getting there. I'm
not arguing with you. I'm getting there. Then you
think that whoever it is that they are the front for
has -- is a Virginia resident. Is that what you
think?
MR. JOSEPH: What we think, Your Honor, is
that they did not prove that that was not the case,
and the burden of proof to sustain jurisdiction was
theirs.
JUSTICE BREYER: Might be a Virginia
resident.
MR. JOSEPH: Correct. We don't know --
JUSTICE BREYER: Might be.
MR. JOSEPH: -- who it is.
JUSTICE BREYER: You think there is a real
party there that might be a Virginia resident. And
do you have any idea whatsoever of what that real
party is called?
MR. JOSEPH: We do not, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: And what's the evidence
that there is a Virginia resident, in there?
MR. JOSEPH: That is the burden-of-proof
failure that the Fourth Circuit found. But the Real
Estate Roundtable brief, at page 11, identifies the
fact that it's very common to have a special-purpose
entity that is property-specific, which gives
further rise to that inference. But it is a failure
of a burden of proof that was ultimately found by
the Fourth Circuit. And because of the failure of
the burden of proof, we're not in a position to
identify the party. Had --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But the failure of the
burden of proof is apparently a function of the
Fourth Circuit's assumption that if you sue the
parent, you have a duty to negate the possibility of
suing any subsidiary; or if you sue the principal,
you have an obligation to negate the possibility of
suing any agent. And I don't see where that comes,
except out of the sky somewhere.
MR. JOSEPH: Justice Souter, I believe, in
fairness to the Fourth Circuit, on page 16(a) of the
petition appendix, they said that they found Lincoln
to be a nominal defendant, not a real party to the
controversy. In that case, the relevance of the
subsidiary or other entity was to determine the
jurisdictional characteristics. And that is the
reason why the Fourth Circuit found a failure of the
burden of proof, because they could not identify, at
the time of that hearing, who was the appropriate
subsidiary and what the jurisdictional
characteristics were.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So, everything turned on
the nominal-party finding.
MR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: On the nominal-party
assumption.
MR. JOSEPH: Correct. There's no dispute
that if Lincoln were a real party to the
controversy, they don't have to join every other
real party to the controversy.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But if the Fourth Circuit
is wrong on nominal party, that's the end of the
case for your side.
MR. JOSEPH: Not quite, Your Honor,
because there's still the burden-of-proof issue.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the burden-of-
proof issue, as you've just answered my question,
does not arise until the Fourth Circuit finds that
Lincoln is a nominal party. And if, in fact, that
conclusion is incorrect, then there's no burden-of-
proof issue that has -- or no burden of proof that
has not been satisfied.
MR. JOSEPH: That is correct only if Your
Honor makes that determination based on matters that
were before the Fourth Circuit. There are a series
of affidavits they rely on that were submitted after
the Fourth Circuit's determination which may affect
the determination as to whether or not Lincoln is a
real party to the controversy.
Specifically, in the blue brief, in
footnote 9, and in the yellow brief, in footnote 15,
they've adduced additional evidence. The Fourth
Circuit was ruling at a point in time as to what the
burden of proof was.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Joseph, do I take
it that the essence of your position is that a
removing defendant, if that removing party is a
corporation, must disclose all affiliates that may
have been involved in the -- in the occurrence that
the plaintiff might have, but failed, to name as a
defendant, that a defendant -- although, on the
surface, there's complete diversity, a defendant
corporation must, in order to remove, identify all
subsidiaries and affiliates who might have been
sued, as well?
MR. JOSEPH: No, Your Honor, that's not
our position. And the reason that's not our
position is that, at the time of removal, every
defendant that is, on the face of the complaint,
diverse has the ability to remove in order to defend
on the grounds that it is innocent -- the innocence
grounds. But if it then steps, instead, to defend
the merits on behalf of another in order to invoke a
Federal forum -- instead of saying, "Not me," which
it could have done, but did not do -- had it said,
"Not me," then the plaintiff would have known that
it should be looking at other entities. In fact, it
said nothing of the sort.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But defendant never
took the position, "Not me."
MR. JOSEPH: That is the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Defendant said --
MR. JOSEPH: -- entire issue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- "Yes, we are the
responsible party."
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, that is correct.
And they clearly were a party to the controversy.
But if they were not the real party to the
controversy, they managed, perhaps, to acquire a
Federal forum by virtue of stepping into the shoes
of the subsidiaries. And that is the argument, that
if they are not the real party to the controversy
because they're litigating the merits on behalf of
another, it's the jurisdictional characteristics of
the other that are germane, and that's the burden-
of-proof failure.
The "real party to the controversy"
doctrine is not a new doctrine to this Court. It
goes back to at least 1809, Brown against Strode. I
mean, the -- it is a fundamental doctrine. And as
Justice Ginsburg pointed out, it goes back as far,
perhaps, as 1789, to the assignee clause in the
Judiciary Act, in section --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I also --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- pointed out it's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question? Did
you engage in discovery trying to determine who the
real party in interest was?
MR. JOSEPH: Trial -- I wasn't trial
counsel, Your Honor. Trial counsel did, in the
Fourth Circuit supplemental appendix, at pages 35 to
, make inquiries.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, did he -- did he
do a thorough job of trying to find out who the real
party in interest --
MR. JOSEPH: No, and -- they did not --
and I --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't it be his
burden, if he thought it was the wrong person?
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, he didn't think
it was the wrong person. He was being told it was
the right person, and shouldn't be faulted for lack
of diligence in accepting the representations that
they had the right person.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but if you accept
the representation, then they sued the right people.
MR. JOSEPH: But, Your Honor, it only
turned out at the end that, in fact, that was not
correct. And these matters snuck in through
discovery, in the course of --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It would seem to me --
MR. JOSEPH: -- discovery that was a
merits discovery.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- if there was a
dispute about this, it ought to -- there ought to
have been extensive discovery before you got to the
court of appeals.
MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, there was --
there were discovery requests served. There was not
discovery forthcoming on the issue of affiliates.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you had no -
- I mean, you had no real reason to do it. You had
somebody there who accepted responsibility, in the
sense that they were willing to defend on the
merits, right?
MR. JOSEPH: That's correct, Mr. Chief
Justice, which is the reason --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's only
because you lost that you now question whether or
not they should have accepted -- you're saying they
shouldn't have accepted responsibility, and
shouldn't have defended on the merits.
MR. JOSEPH: There is no doubt, Your
Honor, this is a Hail Mary pass, because the court
had made clear what its decision was going to be.
But Hail Mary passes connect. And the question is
whether or not a real party to the controversy was,
in fact, litigating. And we believe that it was
not. And that -- we basically come to the argument
that limited jurisdiction means the limits must be
respected. "Real party to the controversy" doctrine
is an established limit. There are federalism
issues involved, and we submit that the fourth
circuit's judgments should be affirmed, because we
did not have the real party to the controversy.
Thank you very much, Your Honors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Joseph.
Mr. Frederick, you have nine minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK: I would waive, but for the
clarification of two points in the record.
Number one, we take umbrage at being
accused of a lack of candor in this Court.
Paragraph 22 of their complaint says, and I'll
quote, "All the defendants, acting through Lincoln
and/or their obligations as owners of the property
through the lease and acting by and through their
agents, were responsible for one or more acts of
common law and/or statutory negligent conduct with
respect to Roche's apartment, including, but not
limited to," a long laundry list.
When the parent is sued for the acts of
its agents, and the parent comes forward and says,
"We will accept the responsibility for our agents,"
there's no cause to be accused of a lack of candor
simply because there's no effort later to identify
who those agents are.
JUSTICE BREYER: But I guess what he's
saying -- I'm trying to put the -- as good a light
on it as I can -- it's a -- that if, in fact -- if a
big real-estate developer, which is a corporation --
what they do is, they organize a lot of deals, and
their deals would take the form of hundreds and
hundreds of limited partnerships, which are owned
buildings in various States. And I think he's
saying, "Well, for diversity purposes, we should
consider the citizenship of the parent corporation
to be the citizenship of the limited partnership
that happens to have control of the building that
we're complaining about."
MR. FREDERICK: And Lincoln had control.
It was acting through agents. That's undisputed.
But the lease says Lincoln Property Company is the
party, as agent, for the owner, SWIB. Lincoln
Property Company set the policies for the mold.
Lincoln Property Company hired Mr. Roche as an
employee. Lincoln Property Company directed the
actions of all of the people involved in this. And
so, there's not -- there's not any basis on which
Lincoln Property could come -- Company could say,
"We are not responsible." And when this was --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, he thinks --
MR. FREDERICK: -- put to us --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- you are responsible,
but he thinks you ought to have the citizenship of
the intermediate entities that own, or manage
directly, the building.
MR. FREDERICK: There would be no
authority from this Court to so hold. And there --
the interrogatory that he points to, interrogatory
number 3, reads as follows, "Identify every person,
other than your attorneys, who is aware of the facts
and circumstances surrounding Mr. Roche's lease at
Westfield Village Apartments and repeat in detail
the substance of such person's knowledge."
Now, from that interrogatory, we are
supposed to infer that there are -- a question about
the citizenship of the affiliated entities through
which Lincoln is operating. We put forward all of
the names of the people that we could identify who
had some knowledge about this. But I would submit
to you that a response, as he is suggesting here in
this Court, is not a reasonable one.
Finally, with respect to Mr. Franzen, the
fact that his title may say "partner" surely cannot
transform the corporation documents that say that
Lincoln Property Company is a corporation in the
State of Texas.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Frederick.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:57 a.m., the case in the
