THE COURT:  We'll hear argument first this
morning in Case 13-1034, Mellouli v. Holder.
Mr. Laramore.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JON LARAMORE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LARAMORE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The initial goal of this appeal was to
reverse a single Board of Immigration Appeals decision
that changed the removability analysis for drug
paraphernalia convictions.  It abandoned the
longstanding practice that Congress had ratified.
We wanted to reinstate the rule that still
applies in all other drug deportation decisions which
looks at the facts that must be established by a
conviction and at the record of conviction, when that's
appropriate, under this Court's precedents  in Moncrieffe
and Descamps.  That methodology has led to tens of
thousands of drug deportations each year, but not for
someone convicted of possessing a sock.
Now, the government has argued that this
wrongheaded BIA paraphernalia decision should be
expanded to all drug convictions.  The government wants
any drug conviction to be a deportable offense, even if
it's clearly for a non-Federal drug.
This Court should reject the government's
position and the BIA's position and adhere to the
time-tested approach that the statute -- to the -- to
the statute that Congress has ratified.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Can we begin by looking at
the text of the statute?  What does the phrase "relating
to a controlled substance," et cetera, modify?
MR. LARAMORE:  Relating to serves the
function of connecting the very broad range of offenses
that Congress wants to make deportable to the list of
substances that -- that the -- that Congress has
specified.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's say we were --
let's say we're back in high school and we have to
diagram this sentence.
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  We could start out that way,
and maybe we'll get beyond it, but let's start out that
way.  We have a phrase here, "relating to a controlled
substance."  What does it modify?  It has to modify a
noun.  What noun does it modify?
MR. LARAMORE:  "Relating to" would modify --
would modify "law" or "regulation."  But if you
bought -- if you diagram the sentence, everything --
JUSTICE ALITO:  If it modifies "law," then I
think you've lost the case.
MR. LARAMORE:  But if -- if you diagram the
sentence, though, everything in that whole phrase,
"convicted of a violation of a law or regulation
relating to a controlled substance under Section 802,"
all modifies "alien."  The whole phrase has to be taken
together and read together to modify what alien is
deportable.
And -- and the pure grammar does -- is not
sufficient to determine what Congress meant when it
enacted that text.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you -- if you -- I
think Justice Alito is right.  If you're claiming that,
then you're accepting that there's ambiguity, and you
have an uphill battle to fight.
MR. LARAMORE:  Well, again, given the text
and the context of this statute and the history of its
application over decades and decades, um there's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's an argument that
they're arbitrary and capricious.
MR. LARAMORE:  Well, it -- it's also part of
the analysis that goes into determining the Chevron, the
question that you allude to, Justice Sotomayor, because
Chevron should be approached after applying the usual
principles of statutory interpretation, and that's --
that's what Chevron says.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait, wait.  How does it --
how does it -- I've missed this.  I -- I'm missing
something.  Why -- why do you lose the case?
MR. LARAMORE:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I -- I assume
that -- I assumed as you said -- what -- what are you
fighting here?  I assumed, as you said, that -- that the
words --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that was my question.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- relating to a controlled
substance as defined in Section 102 concern any law or
regulation.  And --
MR. LARAMORE:  And that's only --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You deny that?
MR. LARAMORE:  Well -- and -- but that's
only part of the analysis.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand that it's not.
I thought that was not your argument to deny that.  Your
argument was that this -- where -- where you have a -- a
State law or a foreign law or something, and it does
relate to the regulation of a controlled substance, but
a lot of other things as well, that that falls outside.
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes.  And particularly in a
sentence that -- that has such a focus on the word
"convicted."
JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose it
relates to the State law, there -- there are 36 802
substances and here it has -- it relates to 37.  That's
case one.
Case two, it relates to 4,037.
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And both of these statutes
contain the 36 that are in Section 802.  One contains
4,000 more, and one contains one more.  How am I
supposed to analyze those two statutes?
MR. LARAMORE:  This goes to the application
of the categorical approach and the modified categorical
approach.  If the identity of the substance is -- is an
element of the offense, then you use the modified
categorical approach, you look at the record of
conviction, and you determine what substance is
involved.  And if it's a substance on the 802 list, then
the person is deportable.
And as the analysis that we've provided in
the appendix to our reply brief shows, many, many, many
State statutes um are divisible in exactly that manner.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So your -- your
argument is, it relates to 4,036, and 36 are 802s.  And
so what we do is we read the statute.  It doesn't tell
us what this conviction is about.  We look to the
documents in the modified categorical.  If it lists one
of the 36, that's the end of it, good-bye, he's
deported.
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  If it doesn't, we don't
know.  If we don't know, he wins.
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes.  That's exactly right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that -- that might be
sensible, but I -- I really do need to start with the
text of the statute and understand what you make of the
text of the statute.
So if "relating to" modifies "law," do you
deny that the law -- that the -- the Kansas law in
question here relates to a controlled substance?  Or do
you read relating to a controlled substance to mean
relating solely to controlled substances as defined by
Federal law?
MR. LARAMORE:  The Kansas statute in this
instance relates to a Federally controlled substance
sometimes.  It relates to -- and that's why --
JUSTICE ALITO:  But the law -- the law
relates to what it relates to.  It doesn't relates to.
It doesn't relate to something at one time and something
at another time.  What does the law relate to?  The law
relates to a long list of drugs.  The great majority of
them are on the Federal list.  A few of them are not on
the Federal list.  Now, if it said relating solely to
drugs on the Federal list, you'd have an argument.  I
just need to know what you want us to do with the text
of the -- of the statute.
MR. LARAMORE:  When it's in the context that
it's in, in -- in this sentence, again, with the focus
on convicted, a -- a law that -- or I'm sorry, a word
that Congress has put -- has used in our immigration
statutes for decades with this particular meaning,
convicted is the statutory hook, as the Court said in
Moncrieffe, for the categorical approach.  And it's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose -- suppose the
State's list was identical to the Federal list.  You
still don't know which particular.  We know, but it's
not part of the charge.
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So Kansas has an
identical list.
MR. LARAMORE:  If it's identical or
narrower, the person is deportable.  And there are many
statutes --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And if it has one that's
different, not deportable?
MR. LARAMORE:  No.  If -- if the -- if the
substance is an element and you use the modified
categorical approach, then you can determine what --
what substance is at issue and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, we don't know what
substance -- in this case, we don't.
MR. LARAMORE:  If you don't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's not charged.  So
it's not an element.
MR. LARAMORE:  That's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it's not -- it's the
difference that --
MR. LARAMORE:  It's not in the record of
conviction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It -- it doesn't seem to
make a whole lot of sense to say deportable if the lists
are identical, but if Kansas has one more on the list
not deportable.
MR. LARAMORE:  This Court has -- well, this
Court has -- has applied the categorical approach in
just that way, as have many of the courts of appeals.
It is a -- it is a way of determining what
is the -- the -- what the person was convicted of,
because you look at the facts that are -- that must be
found for the conviction, and it's a mode of analysis
that's been used in the immigration laws going back
decades.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, that's lovely, but
it doesn't get you around the question that Justice
Alito asked, what is the law?  May I make a suggestion?
MR. LARAMORE:  Certainly, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Perhaps the law -- if you
ask somebody what law did Mellouli violate here, it
would be perfectly natural to respond by reciting one --
the elements of the law that he violated.  He was
convicted of possessing drug paraphernalia to store a
controlled substance.
And so also with any other violation of a
law that names a number of controlled substances.  If
you ask what law did -- did you violate, he would say, I
violated the -- the law that made it unlawful to have
marijuana or that it made it unlawful to have cocaine.
It seems to me you've got to -- you -- you
have to divide the word "law" and the word "regulation"
up into the component elements of the law or regulation
before you can reach the result that you would like to
reach.
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes.  And that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that a good suggestion?
(Laughter.)
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes, your Honor.  And -- and
in our view that's precisely the work that's done in the
statute by the word "conviction" and its association
with the categorical approach.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Laramore --
MR. LARAMORE:  That's the framework.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that is one way of
looking at it, but might I suggest that you gave in a
little bit too fast to Justice Alito that the phrase
"relating to a controlled substance" has to modify
"law."  It's -- it's very true that usually in grammar a
phrase like that would modify the last noun --
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- which in this case is
"law."  There is another noun in this sentence, which is
"violation."  And can I suggest to you that maybe, if
you read this entire provision, it's pretty clearly
talking about violation, because here is the way it
reads.  It's -- "convicted of a violation of any law
relating to a controlled substance other than a
marijuana offense."  "Other than a marijuana offense."
Now, it just doesn't make any sense to say,
a law relating to a controlled substance other than a
marijuana offense.  What makes sense is to say, a
violation of law --
MR. LARAMORE:  Violation.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- other than a marijuana
offense.  So this last phrase, "other than a marijuana
offense," which is an exception and so you say what's it
an exception to?  The offense is an exception to the
violation.  So the violation is the key word doing the
work in this phrase.
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes.  And "law" really has to
be in the sentence to support "States, United States,
and -- and foreign country."  Other -- otherwise, that,
which is an important concept in the law, couldn't be
sensibly -- sensibly there.
JUSTICE ALITO:  It certainly is possible for
"relating to" to modify "violation."  It's an awkward
way of phrasing it, but that is possible.  It's a noun.
It could modify that.
So what would the violation be?  Is the --
the violation then is not -- the violation, I take it,
then, would be the alien's conduct, what the alien did.
MR. LARAMORE:  I think that's right.  I
think that's right.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that right?
MR. LARAMORE:  I believe so.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So what then happens if the
alien's conduct relates to a Federally controlled
substance, but the conviction is under a law that does
not relate to a Federally controlled substance?  What if
the alien, for example, is convicted of burglarizing a
house for the purpose of stealing drugs that are in the
house?
MR. LARAMORE:  It --
JUSTICE ALITO:  The law doesn't relate to a
controlled substance, but the conduct does relate to a
controlled substance.
MR. LARAMORE:  Right.  And the deportability
rises and falls on what the person is convicted of.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  It's not the conduct.
I think you misspoke when you said that.  It's -- the
violation is the crime of conviction.
MR. LARAMORE:  I certainly didn't mean to
say conduct if I did, and I know that conviction is the
key concept here and it always has been the key concept
as we've applied this set of laws to -- to our
immigration, to noncitizens.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  A few moments ago, I
understood you to concede when Justice Ginsburg asked
the question that if there is an exact parallel between
the State law and the Federal law, your client would be
deportable.
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the fact that
there's a -- it's a drug paraphernalia conviction has
nothing to do with the -- the issue before us?
MR. LARAMORE:  Well, the um -- the -- the
drug paraphernalia statute under which he's convicted
requires that the conduct be associated with a
controlled -- a Kansas controlled substance.  So if the
Kansas controlled substance list is the same as the
Section 802 list, and then the conviction satisfies the
statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, so long as the
drug offense is related to, then the paraphernalia
offense is related to?  So it doesn't make any
difference that we're dealing with paraphernalia?
MR. LARAMORE:  I -- I think I understand
your question, and I think that the answer to your
question is yes, because the paraphernalia statute
specifically incorporates the controlled substance
schedule from Kansas.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you don't get any help
by what seems to be the case, that this sock would not
count as drug paraphernalia if we were -- if we were
dealing with a Federal prosecution.
MR. LARAMORE:  You are absolutely right that
it would not.  Possession of paraphernalia is not a
Federal offense.  One cannot be prosecuted Federally for
possessing drug paraphernalia.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the question I wanted
to ask --
MR. LARAMORE:  But that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- is a sock considered
drug paraphernalia under Federal law?
MR. LARAMORE:  It would not, be because the
Federal statute says that -- I don't have the language
in my head, but the concept is that to be paraphernalia
it -- its usual purpose has to be to facilitate drug
sales or drug use or one of those things that
paraphernalia does.  And the Kansas definition is far
broader than that.  It's really any object that can be
used to store or facilitate storage of or facilitate use
of a controlled substance.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's why I
would have thought your answers to me would have been
different because you would want to say that the
paraphernalia is an additional hurdle.  Just because the
drugs relate to the Federal drugs doesn't mean that you
can say the paraphernalia does, because it covers all
sorts of things that the Federal law doesn't.
MR. LARAMORE:  That's correct.  It does --
it does cover many things that the Federal law doesn't.
And it would -- it would be inappropriate.
It -- that shows why this isn't the conduct that
Congress was trying to address when it --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the -- what if
someone was convicted of possession of a pipe that is
very well designed to smoke crack, but maybe conceivably
could be used to smoke a little bit of tobacco.  So
it -- maybe it's lawfully sold in some places because it
could have a legitimate use.  What would -- what would
happen then?
MR. LARAMORE:  The question is what the
person is convicted of and --
JUSTICE ALITO:  He's convicted of possessing
a crack pipe.
MR. LARAMORE:  If he is convicted of
possessing --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It's necessary to show
that -- that there was crack in the pipe?
MR. LARAMORE:  Not under the Kansas statute.
The Kansas statute just says that the -- that the object
has to have -- have been used or is intended to be
used --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in your view, in order
to make -- in order to make this count as a -- as a
deportable offense, it would be necessary to show that
there actually was crack in the pipe or that he actually
used the pipe to smoke crack.
MR. LARAMORE:  Not the way we read the
statute.  But the conviction would have to involve a
controlled substance and would -- if it's both tobacco
and crack, the crack would have to be in the -- in the
conviction.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It has to involve a
controlled -- a Federally controlled substance.
MR. LARAMORE:  It has to involve a Federally
controlled, Section 802 controlled substance, yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that's the
linchpin.
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, crack is a Federally
controlled substance.
MR. LARAMORE:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So I didn't understand the
answer to your question.  Would -- would it be -- would
the crack pipe itself be enough or do you have to show
actual crack?
MR. LARAMORE:  The crack pipe itself would
be enough, as long as there was proof or a pleading to
its use with, at some point, or its intention to be used
with crack.  That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, well, well, wait.
Only -- only using the modified approach so that you
would show it was -- it was intended to be used with
crack.  But on its face, if the Kansas statute still
covers crack, yes, but a lot of other stuff --
MR. LARAMORE:  That is correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that alone would not
support the conviction, would it?
MR. LARAMORE:  That is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you'd have to go to
look to see what he was actually convicted of.
MR. LARAMORE:  Right.  And -- and our
analysis, again, as I point to that lengthy appendix, is
that the great majority of State statutes that cover the
primary drug activities -- manufacturing, sale, and
possession -- are divisible statutes and would be
subject to the modified categorical approach.
There are also many statutes that fit within
the Federal -- within the Federal 802 schedule under the
categorical approach.  There are State statutes that
outlaw marijuana possession, that outlaw narcotic
possession, in ways that -- that the statute just fits
within the categorical approach.  But -- but the
modified categorical approach is what may apply most of
the time and -- and it would -- it -- and really what
we're doing here is, is I'm making this argument about
the modified categorical approach to counter the
government's policy argument, which is that our
perspective would cut back on the number of people who
could be deported for drug violations and -- and that's
just not so.
In fact, the Board of Immigration Appeals
has been applying the law the way we say it should be
applied for -- for all nonparaphernalia offenses for
decades, and it always is deporting, if you look at
their own statistics, 30,000, 35,000 people a year for
drug offenses.
So it's not -- the approach that we are
advocating here, that has been used for many years, is
not something that brings a halt to drug deportations.
Drug deportations have been happening all along in --
under -- under the approach that we suggest.
The government is really reading the law
here to encompass all drug convictions, and it would be
odd for that -- for that argument to be correct, given
that the statute says -- makes this reference to Section
802, which is only Federally controlled substances.
You can't really reconcile that with the
Section 802 reference.  The government's position reads
that out of the statute.
The last -- well, Congress has always --
well, the categorical approach has applied for decades.
The -- the academic history takes it back to 1913, the
first application of the doctrine, and Congress has been
aware of that approach to the law, that approach to
applying the law, has continued to pass statutes that
use the word "convicted," which is what embodies the
categorical approach.  And under the -- under the
application of that principle that we are advocating
here, Congress has add -- has amended the statute
numerous times since it was put into the form it's in
now, which is 1986, in a way that add -- that signifies
its ratification of the approach that we're suggesting.
Congress has not only been aware of the
categorical approach, but also has, since the outset of
the statute, controlled the list of drugs that are
deportable.  And currently, the way the statute is set
up is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Nobody's disagreeing with
the categorical approach.  I don't know why you're
wasting your argument on that.  We -- we all agree with
the categorical approach.
MR. LARAMORE:  Well, let me --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The question is categorical
to what?  That's the issue.
MR. LARAMORE:  Well -- and just to
differentiate our -- what we're saying from the
government's position, which they also argue, is a
species of the categorical approach, we're talking about
the categorical approach as it has traditionally been
applied, where the elements of -- of the conviction have
to be compared to the generic Federal statute or to the
statute of --
JUSTICE ALITO:  When you say "categorical
approach," you mean the modified categorical approach,
do you not?
JUSTICE ALITO:  In -- in a jurisdiction like
Kansas or in any foreign jurisdiction that has a list of
controlled substances that is a little bit broader than
the Federal list, lists at least one or two that are
broader than the Federal list, the pure categorical
approach would never result in -- in removal; am I
right?
MR. LARAMORE:  No --
JUSTICE ALITO:  In a removable offense.
MR. LARAMORE:  That's not correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  How would it?  You'd say --
the person was convicted of selling a drug that is
categorized, that is on a list or part of a list, that
would be the element of the offense.
MR. LARAMORE:  But um --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So you would have to look
beyond that to see which particular drug.  That's the
modified approach, is it not?
MR. LARAMORE:  Many States, including
Kansas, have some statutes that don't invoke their
entire schedule.  For example, a marijuana possession
statute that stands alone.  That would be -- that would
fit under the categorical approach.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not his
hypothetical.  His hypothetical is a statute that
includes one drug which is not on the Federal list.
MR. LARAMORE:  I misunderstood.  Then under
the categorical approach that person would not be
deportable.  As -- as we've shown, we think that most of
those statutes would be analyzable under the modified
categorical approach, yes.
Congress always has retained control over
the substances that can lead to deportability.  Under
the current statute it's opened up the conduct, the
kinds of crimes that are deportable, allowing those to
be crimes defined by the States, defined by the
United States or defined by foreign countries, as long
as they relate to the Federal crimes.
And that is -- that is shown by -- these
substances that are on the State schedules that are not
on the Federal schedules could be on the Federal
schedules if the attorney general determined that they
were serious enough drugs, that they were dangerous
enough drugs.  Some of the subjects -- of the substances
on the Kansas schedule, TFMPP, which is a hallucinogen,
for example, have been on the Federal schedule, but have
been removed from the Federal schedule.
So these indicate that they're -- they're
substances of the sort that the government has not
thought to be significant enough to even involve in
Federal crimes --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, if we -- just
to move you along, if we -- do you agree with the
government that if we find the government's distinction
between drug trade offenses like the paraphernalia
statute and drug possession and distribution offenses
unreasonable, do we remand to the board?  And if not,
why not?  And if you want to save it in an answer on
rebuttal, you can.
MR. LARAMORE:  Well, I think that the -- the
BIA has had its chance to state its position and it has
carved out -- this drug trade exception is really a drug
paraphernalia exception.  Nothing fits within drug trade
except for drug paraphernalia.  The things we ordinarily
think of as drug trade, like selling and trafficking,
are not part of the drug trade exception.
So the BIA has had its chance to -- to
construe the statute.
I'd like to reserve the remainder of my
time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Kovner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. KOVNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
There are two independently sufficient
reasons why Petitioner's drug paraphernalia conviction
permitted his removal.
The first is that Federal law allows the
removal of an alien convicted of violating a law
relating to controlled substances, and State drug laws
that cover hundreds of Federally controlled substances,
in addition to some additional drugs, are laws that
relate to Federally controlled substances.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what if the
State law covers controlled substances entirely
different from the Federal law?  Maybe they figure the
feds can take care of that list; we're just going to
have a law with these.  Does the State law relate to
controlled substances?
MS. KOVNER:  We would say it does not relate
to "controlled substances as defined in Section 802,"
which is the full statutory phrase.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, I don't
understand that.  You're doing the flip of Justice
Ginsburg.  You're -- so how many drugs on that list have
to relate to 802 drugs for it to relate generally?
MS. KOVNER:  It -- we would concede, along
the lines of Justice Breyer's hypothetical, that if you
have a State law that controls 6,000 State-controlled
substances and one federally controlled --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  How about half and half?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Wait, what was the
answer?  If you have it --
(Laughter.)
MS. KOVNER:  That -- that law has the kind
of tenuous relationship to federally controlled drugs
that the Court has said is not a relating to --
relation --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't say more than
tenuously related to.  It says related to.  Where are
you smuggling in the "tenuously"?
MS. KOVNER:  I'm taking it from this Court's
cases.  The Court has said "relating to" is extremely
broad, but the Court has said there is some outer limit
at which even if there's a literal relating to
relationship --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's how you get
to drug paraphernalia, meaning, as Justice Kagan said,
the drug paraphernalia comes in only because it relates
to drug possession and distribution --
MS. KOVNER:  That's right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- of a controlled
substance under 801.
MS. KOVNER:  We think that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or 802, what is it --
whatever it is.
MS. KOVNER:  That's right.  We think that
crimes involving drug paraphernalia are crimes that
relate to controlled substances, and there are two --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You keep leaving out the
802.  There are other sections of the criminal act that
specifically say, any conviction and -- and it could be
of any law, right?  But this one doesn't say it that
way.
MS. KOVNER:  We think that, as Your Honor
correctly notes, these are laws that relate to
controlled substances as defined in Section 802.  And
there are two reasons why:  The first is that a statute
that -- that relates -- a statute that forbids
possession of paraphernalia that's connected to hundreds
of federally controlled drugs, and here nine additional
substances, relates to federally controlled drugs.  And
the second is that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And -- difficult -- now
answer.
MS. KOVNER:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How many of the laws --
how many of the controlled substances have to be on the
State list?  Is 50/50 enough, 75/25, 6 out of --
MS. KOVNER:  We think that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, what -- what's
the -- how many have to be on the list?
MS. KOVNER:  We think that all the State
laws that currently exist are laws that relate to
federally controlled substances.  And all of those --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's not true of
foreign laws and this relates to foreign laws.  I mean,
there are some foreign countries that list many of the
controlled substances the U.S. does but adds alcohol.
Now, some people may think alcohol is a controlled
substance, but it's not on the 802 list.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, we acknowledge
there might be a case involving a foreign law or
involving if in the future a State decided to take a
very different approach, where you would have a literal
relating-to relationship, but there would be a question
of whether the law was so far beyond what existed at the
time and what Congress could have imagined that it no
longer relates to.  But Petitioner's reading of
"relating to" isn't a permissible reading of the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But what second --
second --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you, please -- do you
think that if we apply a modified categorical approach
and focus in on the conviction here which was for a
sock?  Do you think a sock is more than tenuously
related to -- to these Federal drugs?
MS. KOVNER:  Yes, Your Honor.  And here's
why:  These drug paraphernalia statutes modified on the
model act, like Kansas's, are quite broad, and we
acknowledge.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  That's why I'm
proposing modified categorical approach.  He was
convicted of having a sock and you think that's more
than tenuously related to these Federal drugs.
MS. KOVNER:  We do, because he wasn't
exactly convicted of having a sock.  He was convicted
using an innocent item as a tool for the storage of
drugs, and that's true of every drug paraphernalia
conviction.  Typically drug paraphernalia involves
objects that have an innocent use and objects that have
an illicit use.  But essentially every State has decided
that in order to impede the drug trade and drug use you
need to prohibit those.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What about, you said
second?  You said two reasons.  You got your first out
and I'd like to hear your second.
MS. KOVNER:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You said the second, didn't
you?
MS. KOVNER:  There is an additional reason,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  She said it.
JUSTICE BREYER:  She didn't.
MS. KOVNER:  The BIA has reasoned -- the BIA
has reasoned, in a conclusion that entitled to Chevron
deference, that paraphernalia statutes are statutes that
attack the drug trade in general.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now I got the second
one.  Now I do have one question, and it's right related
to Justice Scalia's, and it seems to me  that --
what he said, if I understand it correctly, makes this
not too difficult a case, but you won't like it:
That -- that we have long -- yes, it modifies law, but
we have long, if we go back to the seminal case, Taylor.
There is a Massachusetts statute.  It forbids a burglary
of a boat, a car, and a house.  So what Justice Blackmun
said -- I think it was he who wrote it -- go back to the
documents to see whether he was charged with burglary of
a house, a boat, or a car.
So we have a tradition of looking back to
the charging documents and maybe a couple of others to
see what part of the statute.  Now, this statute is a
statute that first penalizes many, many things,
packaging -- packaging is relevant here.  What kind of
packaging?  Packaging of drugs.  Okay.  What drugs?  It
doesn't say drugs.  It says controlled substance, so you
have to cross-reference.
Then we look to cross-reference, and it says
controlled substance means a substance included on State
schedule 12345 or part B, so it incorporates that.
So then we go look to those documents, and
those documents will have a long list.  And we look to
see here which of the documents on the list which is
incorporated into the statute is he charged of
packaging.  Very simple.  Happens it's not that simple
to do, but that is absolutely traditional given our
holdings on how to apply the categorical -- modified
categorical system.
So why not just do that right here?  Solves
every problem that's raised.
MS. KOVNER:  Let me give two responses.  One
is a textual one, and the second, I think, goes to your
practical point because I really think it's important
that it won't actually solve the practical problems
here.
As to the textual point, when Your Honor
talks about Taylor, I think it's important to note how
different the statute here is, which is unlike many
provisions that talk about being deportable or suffering
some other consequence for being convicted of a crime
relating to something, here it's talking about being
convicted of violating a law relating to something.
But I really want to address this practical
point, because, Your Honor, we think the result under
Petitioner's view is going to be a real patchwork in
terms of what conduct is removable depending on what
State you're in.  And the reason why, Justice Breyer, is
that it's not going to be possible to apply the modified
categorical approach to many drug statutes.  It will
sometimes and it won't other times, and let me explain
why.
For instance, here, under this statute, it
appears and under paraphernalia status generally, there
will typically not be a requirement of a finding or an
admission of what particular drug you intended to use
the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if I understand the way
the law works, right, Ms. Kovner, that's -- that is true
of paraphernalia drugs, that they're indivisible with
respect to the controlled substance.  It's not true with
respect to most possession statutes or distribution
statutes or so forth.  And the reason that there is that
distinction is because paraphernalia offenses are
generally extremely minor offenses; they're not
felonies.  They're just, as in this case, they're
misdemeanors that are meant to catch leftover things
that, you know, prosecutors plead to when they don't
really want to charge a more serious offense.
And so it makes good sense that all of these
paraphernalia offenses would be counted out by this
approach.  You're counting out a bunch of trivial -- I
mean, you know, "trivial," I don't want to say
trivial -- minor offenses.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, I think two points
about that.  The first is that we don't think it's
correct that this is going to be just paraphernalia
offenses and not any possession or distribution
offenses.  And if you look at the cases that are cited
on page 31 of our brief, they illustrate that, which is
the conviction records are not necessarily specifying
the drug that's involved in a particular offense.  And
so you're going to have a really haphazard system.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, right now even
your brief admits that the BIA is applying a different
standard to possession and distribution offenses.  It's
applying the 802 specification.
MS. KOVNER:  Your --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And it's trying to draw
a difference.  I don't -- I still don't understand how
it does it, but my point is that you're proving it's --
you're living by the 802 distinction with distribution
and possession.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, I'm not sure that
that's true.  We think that the BIA's precedent at this
point in unclear.  The BIA --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah, what you're hoping
for is that they will change that one, too.  But let's
answer what's happened up until now.
MS. KOVNER:  Yes.  As to what's happened up
until now, I don't think that's clear.  My understanding
is that the BIA will generally try to seek removal of
people who have been convicted --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because they have
discretion.  If they're not automatically removable and
they look at the underlying papers and decide it's a
more serious crime than -- than the -- than the strict
removability statute, they let the person -- they remove
this person anyway.
MS. KOVNER:  I don't think that's correct,
Your Honor.  What we're seeking here is the authority to
seek removal for persons who've committed these
offenses.  If -- in this case, for instance, if we were
to not prevail, we would lack the authority, the
government would lack the authority to remove Petitioner
no matter how serious it regarded his underlying
conduct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  A couple of
sentences ago you said that a sock, when it's used in
connection with the drug activity, is sufficiently
related to the Federal Controlled Substances Law.  What
about a gun?  Those are often used in connection with
drug activity.  So is a law concerning gun possession or
gun control or whatever, a State law that relates to the
Federal Controlled Substances Law?
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, I think this would
be a -- a difficult question on either of our sides,
which is to say, for -- for both parties there would be
some set of statutes that are related to -- that have
some connection to drugs indirectly and there would be a
question of whether those statutes count.  We don't
think that a statute that addresses guns merely because
guns and drugs have some, you know, relationship --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, yes.  But if a
statute addresses socks, it does.
MS. KOVNER:  Well, here, Your Honor, it's
not a statute addressing socks.  It's a statute --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It was addressing
socks when used in connection with drug activity.  I'm
talking about guns when used in connection with drug
activity.
MS. KOVNER:  Oh.  Your Honor, a statute like
the 924(c) that applies to guns when used in connection
with drug activity, we think would be a law that relates
to controlled substances.  We think statutes that
regulate conduct, that um leads to the proliferation of
drugs or the use of drugs is a poor statute relating to
the drug trade.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Under your definition --
under your understanding of this, what practical work is
done by the phrase as defined in Section 802 of Title
XXI?
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You said a couple of minutes
ago, and I had assumed this to be true, that under the
laws of all the States, the great majority of controlled
substances are on the Federal list, and there -- in some
instances -- are a few additional ones and you said that
all of those laws would be covered.  If that's the case,
then I don't see what was achieved by putting the
reference to the Federal list in the statute.  They
might have just said relating to a controlled substance.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, we think that this
parenthetical clarifies that -- the meaning of
controlled substance, the thing that it has to relate to
are the substances as defined in Federal law.  There is
another colloquial meaning of controlled substance if
you look in, like, Black's Law Dictionary, which is just
any regulated drug and that would apply to, for
instance, prescription drugs that aren't controlled
under the Controlled Substances Act.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would it have to be drugs?
I mean, there are some States that ban pate, for
example, right?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You wouldn't want that
swept into this statute, would you?
MS. KOVNER:  That would not be a statute
under the law of a State relating to a controlled
substance as defined in Section 802, because it wouldn't
be regulated under a State's direct statutes that also
include the Section 802 substances.
And if I could just explain why we think
that Congress enacted or -- a law that applies to any
person who violates a State law relating to controlled
substances.  When Congress enacted the -- the provision
of the INA that's currently in effect, it acted against
the backdrop of State laws that were designed to tightly
coordinate with Federal laws and that were designed to
produce the kind of regime that they have, in fact,
produced for any -- any overlap between the State and
Federal schedules is the overwhelming proportion of the
drugs that are controlled on State schedules.
And, Justice Breyer, if the Court were to
hold that those laws aren't laws relating to controlled
substances, whether an alien is removable under those
State laws designed to parallel with Federal laws is
going to depend on what -- what kinds of findings the
State requires to be made in connection with those
possession --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's -- it wouldn't
make that law a nullity.  Indeed, the person would be
deportable provided when you went through the State
charge, the State charge was you violated the packaging
for use statute, packaging a controlled substance, in
respect to Item 13 under Schedule II, which they could
say, anyway, and that happens to be heroin.  And if, in
fact, when you went through Schedule III, Part 4(a), the
word there was "alcohol," then it wouldn't.
Now, that's simple.  And if the State's
charging practice is such that they don't tell you,
that's equivalent to a State charging practice that in
Massachusetts didn't tell you whether you were accused
of burglary of a boat, of a house or of a car.  And if
the State wants to do that, I guess it might be up to
them if you get a guilty plea and then you could not
deport the person.
MS. KOVNER:  But Congress didn't want that
result, Justice Breyer.  Congress --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I want -- a lot of
people -- but they can't control the State charging
practices and the States are likely, for reasons of
information, to put in the charge the whole thing,
including the correct reference on the schedule.  So is
that the only thing you find wrong with it?  And I agree
with you that that is a slight problem, that -- that
we'll read back the conviction of four years ago in
Missouri and we will see that it doesn't tell us what
item on the schedule.  That's the problem that you see.
MS. KOVNER:  That --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Any other?
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, that's a
significant practical problem that's going to introduce
widespread variation in the deportability of people who
have committed crimes involving Federally controlled
substances.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But -- but as Ms. -- as
Justice Sotomayor suggested, it's a significant
practical problem that's implicated in the current
practice of the BIA.
MS. KOVNER:  I -- I'm -- I don't think
that's correct.  We think the current BIA precedent is
quite ambiguous on the possession point and we think
that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It at least might be
implicated in the current practice of the BIA.
MS. KOVNER:  We think that the BIA's
precedent on this point is unclear.
But, Justice Breyer, our argument isn't just
about the practical consequences.  It's also about the
best reading of this text.  We don't think this text
is -- is ambiguous.  It talks about violations of laws
relating to --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You have to choose.  As you
well know, the problem you just mentioned is a problem
that we're just having a terrible time with in respect
to the violence add-ons.  And it's -- stems from the
fact that State laws differ one from the other
enormously.  So we either have that problem or we have
the problem of you have a general statute and which does
it apply more to and so forth.  Or you have the problem
of do you look -- as I think Justice Kagan's approach --
do you -- you look at the individual facts of the case
and require them to prove it out again.  I -- I don't
see how we escape one serious problem or another.
MS. KOVNER:  I agree.  And let me propose
that there are -- there's difficulties under either
approach -- approach.  Let me tell you why I think this
is the best approach here.
The first is I think the text signal that
Congress chose our approach here.  And the text is
different from any other similar provisions.  The second
is that there's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's -- it's exactly
like it.  When Congress intended to say -- and I can
point to at least three provisions -- when it wanted to
say any controlled substance without reference to -- to
802, it said, any controlled substance.  And when it
wanted to limit it to 802, it defined the controlled
substance as being listed in 802.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it knows how to
differentiate the two.
MS. KOVNER:  The -- the textual contrast that
we find most revealing here is that there are provisions
of the INA that talk about being removable for a crime
related to controlled substances, and then you would do
the categorical approach just as you're proposing.  But
let me just mention the practical reason why we think
our approach is preferable, Justice Breyer, and why we
think that Congress chose it, which is that Congress
acted against the backdrop of State drug laws like
Kansas's, which -- which weren't States just enacting
random lists of substances as their controlled substances.
These laws are designed, as -- as Congress put it, as an
interlocking trellis to closely relate to Federal law.
So Congress wanted --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Ms. Kovner, I would
think that the history works against you in the
following way:  Because the prior statute here was a
statute that listed all these Federally controlled
substances.  And that eventually got to be impractical,
there were too many of them, they kept changing and so
Congress went to this approach.  But it was clear in the
old statute that the only way that you could be held
deportable was if you had been convicted of an offense,
you know, possession or distribution or whatever, with a
Federally controlled substance.  And there's no reason
to think that in enacting this statute that -- that
Congress meant to do something broader than that.
There's every reason to think it wanted to do the exact
same thing.  If you're convicted of a controlled
substance -- of possession of a controlled substance,
you are deportable.  If you're not, if it's only
Sudafed, you're not.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, I don't think
that's correct.  Congress, in the prior versions of the
statute, did specify particular acts that your conduct
had to involve and also specified a narrower list of
substances that your conduct had to relate to.  But I
don't think it's clear that Congress believed -- there's
nothing in the legislative history or other documents to
suggest that Congress believed that "relating to"
language meant involving --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  But the question is,
when Congress makes a change like that, which we know is
a change for a particular reason because the list of
substances was getting out of control -- it's very much
like yesterday's case; I don't know if you're familiar
with that -- but Congress makes a change for one reason,
suggests -- does not make any -- any suggestion that
this change is supposed to do something else and
something much bigger, which is extend this
deportability provision to controlled substances that
aren't part of the Federal list, and there's just no
reason to think that Congress did that in making this
change.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, the -- the
"relating to" language, which is very broad language, is
within the prior statute, and it's within the statute
now.  We don't think there's an indication that Congress
read that statute narrowly in the prior versions.  We
think the plain meaning of that -- that language is
quite broad.
Your Honor, let me just mention.  There is a
second reason that we've talked principally about the
first one, but the BIA was also entitled to Chevron
deference for its separate reasoning pertaining to
paraphernalia.  The BIA has for many, many years
reasoned that there are some crimes that are related to
the drug trade in general, not necessarily to any
individual substance.  And the earliest case on this was
a case about --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Espinoza came out when?
MS. KOVNER:  The case I'm thinking of is
Martinez-Gomez from 1972, which talks about opening a
drug -- essentially, opening a drug den, and they say
that's a crime that doesn't necessarily relate just to
any individual substance; it bears a relationship to all
substances.  And then in Martinez Espinoza, more
recently, um the Court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That was a Federal
crime, though.  It had to relate to a controlled
substance on the Federal list, to all drugs on the
Federal list.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, the reasoning of
Martinez-Gomez and then the reasoning of Martinez
Espinoza is that these are crimes that don't necessarily
have to bear a relationship to a single substance.  For
instance, drug paraphernalia are tools that can be used
with multiple substances.  So you might possess, you
know, scales and baggies for the purpose of packaging a
particular drug on one occasion, but those items can
just as easily facilitate those activities with respect
to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But a -- a sock.  I mean,
one of the strange things about this case is you have a
disjunction.  A sock doesn't count as drug paraphernalia
under the Federal law, but it does under the State law;
it means any container.  And then to take that State
law -- I mean, suppose we -- we have a conviction for
one of those drugs that's not on the Federal list, just
for possession of that drug, and then we have another
conviction where that drug is inside a sock and it's for
drug paraphernalia.
So in the one case you would say not
removable, if it's just the substance itself, and in the
other case, because of the sock, it becomes removable?
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, I agree that I
think a strange feature of this case is that it involves
an item that's not usually thought of as drug
paraphernalia.  I think the classic paraphernalia items
and the ones you see most often prosecuted in Kansas and
in other States are things like hyperdermic needles and
scales and substances that are used to mix with drugs
before sale, and I think it's easiest to see in that
case why the BIA's reasoning makes sense, which is,
those items, when they're possessed by somebody in
connection, even with a State-controlled drug, are
tools --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't think that's the
important point that Justice Ginsburg's making.  She's
saying under Federal law, this person can't be convicted
for that drug -- that's not a drug on the Federal
list -- but it can -- or the State list -- but can be
convicted, under your theory, for possessing the sock
and that non-illicit drug in the sock.
MS. KOVNER:  For possessing the sock.  And I
think it's easiest --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  With the -- with that
particular unscheduled item.
MS. KOVNER:  And I think it's easiest to see
why the BIA drew this conclusion when you talk about the
more classical tools of paraphernalia, which is, if
somebody possesses scales and distribution baggies and
cut in connection with a State-controlled substance --
say it's synthetic marijuana, an item that's not
Federally controlled at the time -- those are tools that
could be used in connection with a Federal drug as well.
And so this -- the BIA reasoned that there are certain
crimes that -- that involve conduct that could
facilitate the distribution of one drug just as easily
as another.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do we -- do we even know
that this is a -- a proper conviction under Kansas law,
that the Kansas statute actually means what it's been
interpreted here to mean?  The Petitioner pled guilty to
this, I think, because he got a break, because he could
have been charged with something -- if, in fact, he had
Adderall, which is a Federally controlled substance --
he could have been charged with something more serious.
So he pled to this misdemeanor.  But it's really hard to
believe that the Kansas statute actually regards as drug
paraphernalia anything that is used at any time to
contain a controlled substance.
Suppose somebody buys marijuana or some
other drug and it's in a plastic bag.  So the plastic
bag is -- that's one violation.  The person puts it in a
pocket; that's another violation.  The pocket is -- is
drug paraphernalia.  Takes it out of the pocket and puts
it in the glove compartment of a car; that's a third
violation.  The car is equipment that's used to store
it.  Takes it out of that, puts it in something -- it --
it can't really mean this, but we don't have State court
interpretations.
MS. KOVNER:  That's right.  And if I could
just make two brief points about that.
You're right that this was a result of a
plea, and as a result, we don't know exactly what Kansas
courts would say about this application, which is a very
unusual application.  But I think that illustrates,
Justice Alito, I think, the bad consequences of
Petitioner's view, which is, for Petitioner, even if it
was cocaine that was stored in the sock, if he pleads
guilty to the paraphernalia offense, the BIA will lack
any ability to take enforcement action against him,
because he's convicted of a paraphernalia crime, and the
nature of the substance doesn't --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  If he had cocaine in his
sock, he would probably be convicted of possession of
cocaine.
MS. KOVNER:  But --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  He was convicted of
paraphernalia here because he had four pills of
Adderall, which if you go to half the colleges in
America, people -- you know, and just randomly pick
somebody, there would be a decent chance --
(Laughter.)
MS. KOVNER:  I think -- I think Justice
Alito's explanation of this case explains why that's not
so.  In a plea bargain, prosecutors may be willing to
let somebody plead to a drug paraphernalia offense in
lieu of a possession offense, and Congress did not want
the fact that a State or local prosecutor allows that
kind of plea bargain to mean that immigration
authorities lack the ability to remove somebody
convicted of a crime that relates to a controlled
substance.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I would have
thought the opposite inference.  If it's not such a big
deal that the State is willing to let him cop a plea to
drug paraphernalia, why should that be the basis for
deportation under Federal law?
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, we don't think that
Congress viewed drug crimes that way.  The way it wrote
this removal provision was to say that any crime
relating to controlled substances permits the BIA to
seek removal.  And that's because, we think, Congress
saw drug crimes as quite serious.  This Court has
recognized that, and Congress has essentially said so in
other statutes.  So we --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but, I mean,
the only -- it's because you give "relating to" such a
broad construction that you get the -- what I think is
the unusual situation that I talked about, which is that
the State thinks it's a very minor offense and yet it
can become so significant that the person's deported.
MS. KOVNER:  But Petitioner's approach is a
poor way of reading a crime severity distinction into
the statute.  We don't think that's what the language
allows, for minor drug crimes to be set aside as a basis
for --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why is it a poor way?  I
mean, the drugs that the Federal government believes are
the most serious are listed in 802.  And so if you have
to prove, under the modified categorical approach, that
one of those drugs was the intended use, what is so
horrible and -- and dissonant about affecting the intent
based on the drugs Congress has chosen to list?
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, it's a bad way
because serious drug crimes involving Federally
controlled substances will not be removable under
Petitioner's view.  And to get --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no, no, no.  We
-- I know that you keep saying "for many years," but
it's not that many years.  And the BIA has routinely
required in distribution and possession cases that you
identify the drug.
MS. KOVNER:  Your --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so they haven't
found it impossible in thousands of those cases.  It may
be more difficult in the drug paraphernalia case because
Justice Kagan was right.  They're minor offenses; often,
States won't bother with pleas that are very lengthy or
very complex.  But that's a happenstance.  That's not --
MS. KOVNER:  It would --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does it call for
changing the natural reading of the sentence?
MS. KOVNER:  No.  We -- Your Honor, we're
seeking the application of what we think is the best
reading of the sentence.  Your Honor, I think if you
look at the BIA cases that we cite on Page 31, they show
that Petitioner's approach will prevent the removal of
aliens committing crimes involving Federally controlled
substances in many cases because the conviction records
aren't going to specify the drug involved.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,  counsel.
Mr. Laramore, you have four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JON LARAMORE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LARAMORE:  First, the BIA's position is
not unclear or in flux.
The BIA reaffirmed in a case called Ferreira
last year, cited on page 22 of our reply brief, its
position, just as Justice Sotomayor said, that the
substance has to be identified in um possession and sale
cases and it has to be an 802 substance.  That's a
system that has been in place for decades.  It has
worked.  It has allowed the deportation of drug
criminals.  It doesn't need to be changed.
I'd ask the Court to focus on -- on
something that -- that Ms. Kovner raised, which is what
Congress intended and knew about when it enacted this
version of the statute in 1996, and -- I'm sorry, 1986.
And she said that they knew about the Uniform Controlled
Substances Act and that may have had an influence,
although there's nothing that shows in the legislative
history that it did.
But Congress also knew about the categorical
approach when it put the word "convicted" into the
statute at that time.  And it knew that the categorical
approach and the modified categorical approach would be
used when it -- when it invoked the word "convicted."
And that's what we're asking the Court to reaffirm now.
The word "law" that we've talked about so
much that's in the sentence, or "law and regulation,"
is necessary in the statute to support what -- another
thing that Congress tried to do in that law, in that
statute, which was to clearly invoke States' authority
and foreign countries' authority to convict -- to allow
those convictions to support deportation.  And if --
there's -- it was a convenient way to insert that
concept into the statute.
I would also point out that the
underpinnings of the Martinez Espinoza case, which is
the one that they rely on now -- this is the so-called
drug trade exception, this -- which is really just a
drug paraphernalia exception -- are not nearly as
strong as the government suggests.
Martinez-Gomez is a case about -- I'm not
quite sure what you call it -- a drug house, a place
where drugs are commonly used.  But there was no
indication in Martinez-Gomez that it necessarily
involved any substances that were not Section 802
substances.
It's not very strong support for this
creation out of really whole cloth a drug trade
exception.
Thank you.
