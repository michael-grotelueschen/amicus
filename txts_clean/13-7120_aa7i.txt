States.
Ms. Menendez.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE M. MENENDEZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. MENENDEZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Mere possession of a short-barreled shotgun
is not a violent felony within the definition of the
Armed Career Criminal Act's residual clause because it
is neither similar in the degree of risk nor similar in
kind to the enumerated offenses set forth in the
language that immediately precedes that clause.  And
this Court has repeatedly held that those enumerated
offenses provide important both qualitative and
quantitative parameters to lower courts in examining
whether a particular predicate offense counts as a
violent felony.
Just 6 years ago in Begay, this Court made
clear that the enumerated offenses must be similar --
I'm sorry, a question predicate offense must be similar
in kind to one of the enumerated offenses as well as
similar in degree of risk.  And when that proper
framework is applied to the question of mere possession
of a short-barreled shotgun, it satisfies neither test.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Should the Court --
should the Court take into account that in the
sentencing guidelines a possession of a short-barreled
shotgun is ranked under career, is under the career
offenses?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, in Guideline
Amendment 674 in 2004, which Your Honor asks about, the
Sentencing Commission included mere possession of an
unregistered short-barreled shotgun or possession of a
short-barreled shotgun as a crime of violence.  But it
did not do so after an examination of the empirical data
or an assessment of the pool of data that gives us great
confidence in the Sentencing Commission's decisions.
In marked contrast, Your Honor, in 1991,
when the Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 433
that concluded that being a felon in possession of a
firearm should not count as a crime of violence under
the guidelines, it reached that conclusion after an
extensive examination of empirical data.  The difference
between the adoption of those two amendments highlights
the reason that the Sentencing Commission's decision on
this point does not deserve deference in this case.
An additional consideration, Your Honor, is
that in making that decision in 2004, the Sentencing
Commission was not anticipating the guidance that this
Court provided in James, Begay, Chambers, and Sykes, and
it doesn't engage in any of the proper analysis.  So
whether we look at it as the Sentencing Commission not
serving their traditional role as factfinders and the
keepers of empirical data or whether we acknowledge the
fact that it preceded very important guidance from this
Court, I don't think it controls this Court's decision.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is it --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it possible --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it possible for any
possession offense to qualify as a violent felony?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I believe it
would be possible for a very rare possession offense to
qualify as a violent felony if the possession alone
presents a serious potential risk of injury.
Respectfully, I believe the flaw with the other side's
position in this case is their entire analysis is based
not on the risk inherent in the mere possession, but on
the risk inherent in committing a further violent crime
with that weapon.  And so I believe that any mere
possession of a firearm, including a short-barreled
firearm, is not going to satisfy the definition.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if I understand the
government's argument, it's that there's a very strong
correlation between possession in this case and use for
criminal purposes of a kind that clearly would pose a
risk of -- of violent conduct and injury.  So are you
saying that we never can take that kind of correlation
into account, that possession crimes just have to be
treated in a box, and we can't think about whether the
possession of something increases the risk of use which
then will pose a serious risk of injury?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your -- Your Honor, my
response is twofold.  First, although the government has
asserted that correlation, they have not substantiated
it in any way.  And there's no data before the Court
that supports the claim that merely possessing a
short-barreled shotgun is somehow connected with
frequent or even regular use.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So -- so that seems right,
that it's a question to pose to the government.  It's
like, what's in back of this correlation?  But is your
argument, then, they haven't made their empirical case
or even if they had lots of statistics, it still
wouldn't be enough?
MS. MENENDEZ:  And that is correct, Your
Honor.  I think even if they had made the empirical
case, it wouldn't be enough.  And here's why.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  is there any other
use for a short-barreled shotgun?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, as many as 40,000
Americans have purchased these weapons legally,
registered them lawfully and have found that they serve
some purpose.  Whether that purpose is in hunting for a
person of a smaller stature or home defense, the
question before the Court is not whether there is some
reason to have them.  Many people believe there is.  The
question is whether merely possessing such a weapon is a
violent felony.  And with due respect, Your Honor, I
don't think there's any support for the assertion that
these are somehow uniquely more dangerous.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  People have purchased this
even though it's criminal to possess it?
MS. MENENDEZ:  It is not, Your Honor.  In
fact, it's fully lawful to possess a short-barreled
shotgun in many States as long as it's registered
federally, somebody passes a background check, and pays
a $200 tax.  And the government's own statistics
document, Your Honor, that as many as tens of thousands
of Americans have followed those processes in order to
legally purchase or own one of these weapons.  And, in
fact, I was surprised in doing the research for this
case that you can get these on line in States where
their possession is legal as long as you comply with the
Federal regulations.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How many States is it
illegal, do you remember?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I believe there's
10 States that outright ban possession regardless of
compliance with Federal regulations.  And then in the
remainder of the States, the question is whether, if its
possession is legal in compliance with either State
registrations or always in compliance with the Federal
registrations.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just a factual question.
On his plea for this possession, was he charged with
another crime?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Yes, he was, Your Honor.  He
was charged with a -- a marijuana-related crime.  And
both of those were pleaded guilty to with Alford pleas,
Your Honor.
Your Honor, I think the question is how much
speculation is permitted.  And as Your Honor correctly
points out, it is our position that even if the
government brought forth better data, that still
wouldn't justify allowing mere possession to count as a
crime of violence.  The reason, I think, is inherent in
this Court's jurisprudence from James, Begay, and the
other cases.  We have to begin this with a consideration
of the elements.  In fact, in the James case --
JUSTICE ALITO:  But you said that a
possession offense could qualify.  So if someone
possesses a nuclear bomb, that could qualify?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I think that
might be --
JUSTICE ALITO:  A biological or chemical
weapon, that could qualify?
MS. MENENDEZ:  And I think that is the
precise thing that could qualify.  And here is why, with
due respect, Your Honor.  Possessing a biological or a
chemical agent, by itself, presents a substantial risk,
just alone, even if it's under your bed.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how do we know that?
You -- you could make the same argument that you've just
made, that we don't know what the -- the risk is that
this will, in the case of a biological weapon, the risk
that it will cause an infection unintentionally.  We
don't know that.  That statistic is no more available
than the statistic on sawed-off shotguns, is it?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I suspect that we
would be better able to document the certainty that even
doing nothing more than possessing such an item --
JUSTICE ALITO:  How would you do that?
You'd look at all the -- you try to -- to identify the
universe of people who have possessed biological weapons
and see how many times somebody has gotten infected
unintentionally?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, that -- that
might be appropriate, or perhaps the science alone.  But
that demonstrates the difference with this.  This is no
more dangerous than any other firearm if it's kept in a
locked gun safe, kept in a closet, kept under a
mattress, under a bed or any of the other myriad places.
We've highlighted for the Court 14 different cases on
page 14 of our reply brief where such a weapon was found
in completely nonviolent circumstances, somewhere in a
home or even in a trunk, in a locked gun safe.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So you would say the same
thing about any weapon.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Any firearm for certain, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Any firearm?  Mortars?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE ALITO:  Mortars?  Artillery pieces?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I think mere
possession does not pose the kind of substantial risk
that this statute is talking about.  I think that when
we get into the very, I'm sure, hypothetical instance of
the bomb that's inherently dangerous, like a biological
agent, that might be different even untouched, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Rockets would not be --
illegal possession of a rocket, that wouldn't be a
violent felony in your submission.  Maybe that's right.
MS. MENENDEZ:  I believe that's correct,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  That's correct.
MS. MENENDEZ:  I believe that using a rocket
in a crime of violence or in any other circumstance
would be.  And, in fact, Your Honor, I think that in
many of these cases, for instance possession of a
biological agent or a nuclear weapon, the person would
likely be charged with some sort of terrorism offense,
which would, by itself, trigger the Armed Career
Criminal Act if they were free to go on and commit
future crimes, which I -- I somewhat doubt.
In this case, though, I think there's
nothing different about mere possession of a
short-barreled shotgun as compared to other firearms
that could be simply possessed.  They are simply not
enough.
Your Honors, this Court's jurisprudence
clearly requires a categorical assessment of the
question, not an imagining of what further crimes could
ever happen as a result of the offense, but a looking at
what comes from the elements itself.  I'd encourage the
Court to remember its decision in James.  In James, the
Court first examined the elements of the burglary, the
attempted burglary statute in question, and noted that
mere possession of burglary tools was not enough to
constitute a violation of that attempted burglary
statute.  And in part, because an overt act toward
entry, which presented the same sort of risk as the
burglary itself was present, the Court found that that
could present a risk sufficient to trigger the residual
clause.
This is very different.  This is much more
like mere possession of the burglary tools, which would
not be enough, than it is completing an additional overt
act.
Your Honor, the government uses the Court's
language of ordinary case to invite this Court to engage
in substantial speculation about someone -- what someone
might do with a short-barreled shotgun.  And with due
respect, I don't believe that was the purpose of the
ordinary case doctrine whatsoever.  In fact, in James,
the ordinary case doctrine was borne not to enable
rampant and creative speculation, but to limit rampant
and creative speculation.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But what you have -- what
were the numbers, if they're there, about how many
people are injured as a result of possession of a
short-barreled shotgun?
MS. MENENDEZ:  There are no statistics.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So we have absolutely no
idea?
MS. MENENDEZ:  We have -- we have no
statistics that demonstrate, Your Honor, a correlation
between mere possession of a short-barreled shotgun
and --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's not what I'm
thinking of.  I'm thinking of do we have a statistic
that says how many people are injured, forgetting how --
whether it's possession or not possession or anything
else?
MS. MENENDEZ:  We don't have that, either,
Your Honor.  We do have statistics offered both in our
brief and some reference in opposing counsel's brief
about how short-barreled shotguns are at most a de
minimis, de minimis percentage of harm from weapons in
general across the country, but that doesn't answer Your
Honor's question.  And Your Honor, I think that that is
precisely why the Begay formulation remains very
important in this case.
This case, unlike Sykes, which had an ample
amount of data, although I think we could discuss at
length how useful that data is and how much data can be
manipulated, but there was a great deal of data
documenting deaths and injuries.  And therefore, this
Court found that the examination of the nature of the
offense and whether it was purposeful, violent or
aggressive was redundant.  That's not the case here,
Your Honor, because we don't have the statistical
analysis to make the risk assessment easy.
I do think, though, that common sense weighs
heavily in favor of Mr. Johnson.  And that is, as Your
Honor indicated in the Doe opinion many years ago on the
First Circuit, that merely possessing something is a
very far cry from using it in a crime.  And the
government's entire analysis requires this Court to
assume that these weapons are most commonly possessed
only for the purpose of being used in a crime.  That's
simply not supported by the data, and it's not even
supported by the case law provided by the government.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Do we know
how many possession crimes have been prosecuted,
possession for short-barreled shotguns?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I don't have that statistic,
I apologize, Your Honor.  I can say that, having been an
assistant Federal defender for quite a long time, we
don't see these very commonly, but we do see people
prosecuted for possessing a short-barreled shotgun
that's not federally registered.  It's not an incredibly
frequent crime.
However, this has greater implications,
obviously, Your Honor, because approximately 600 people
every year suffer the greater penalties of the Armed
Career Criminal Act as a result of enhancements such as
this.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what I mean.
It's about 600 a year?
MS. MENENDEZ:  600 ACCA cases each year,
more or less, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  More or less.  So we're
talking about 35,000 people or 40,000 who own the
shotguns legally.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Oh, I apologize, Your Honor.
I -- I provided Your Honor an incorrect statistic.  I'm
talking about people whose current conviction is for
felon in possession, triggering the Armed Career
Criminal Act.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I see what you mean.
MS. MENENDEZ:  I apologize.  I -- I do not
know how many people nationwide are prosecuted for
violation of one of the several States that outright
bans these or for violating some other portion.  I do
know that they're not very common in the State of
Minnesota, which is where our statute arises.
Your Honors, it's also important to keep in
mind that in Minnesota as well as almost every place
else that this is criminalized or criminalized if not
properly registered, that constructive possession of the
weapon alone is enough to make somebody guilty.  This
doesn't have to be on or near their person.  It
certainly need not be used in a crime or possessed with
the intent to use it in a future crime.  And, in fact,
some of the cases that we've proffered to the Court
involve possessing this in nothing more than a locked
gun case.  That is simply not the sort of active,
purposeful, violent and aggressive or risky conduct that
the Armed Career Criminal Act's residual clause is
designed to apply to.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  When you say "constructive
possession," what does that mean?
MS. MENENDEZ:  That means where you don't
have an item directly on your person, Your Honor, but
you have the intent, at least in the Eighth Circuit,
it's the intent to exercise dominion and control and the
power to do so.  So, for instance, I have constructive
possession of the items in my briefcase, even though I
don't have them with me and I have constructive
possession of items in my home, even though that's back
in Minnesota.  And so that demonstrates, Your Honor, the
broad application of mere possession crimes and how far
removed they can be from the parade of horribles, with
due respect, that the government suggests these are
inherently intrinsically tied to.
Your Honor, I'd also invite the Court to
examine closely the cases cited by opposing counsel in
their brief, because while they do cite 16 cases in
their brief in which mere -- I'm sorry, in which
short-barreled shotguns were used in violent crimes,
it's important for the Court to note that in only two of
those cases was there actually a conviction for a
weapons offense or mere possession of a weapon.  So in
only two of those cases was the prior offense actually
before the Court today even being considered.
In the other 14, and indeed also in those
two, the person was convicted of the far more serious
crime of violence that the weapon was used during,
ranging from assault to capital murder.  And as Justice
Gruender, in his dissent in the Vincent case in the
Eighth Circuit made very clear, in such a case, that
much more serious offense would readily trigger
application of the Armed Career Criminal Act and we
wouldn't need to resort to the overinclusive
interpretation proffered by the Government.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What are -- what do you
think is the basis for a State legislature's prohibiting
the possession of a short-barreled shotgun or a
short-barreled shotgun that is not properly registered?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I can't say what
all the State legislatures' bases were, although I would
note that Michigan just last year changed its mind and
made these lawful.  But I think that many State
legislatures, and indeed Congress in 1934 when it
decided to regulate these weapons, were persuaded by at
least the reputation of this gun, that it was associated
with gangster activity in the Prohibition era.
With due respect, although I am not at all
disagreeing that States are within their rights to ban
possession of this weapon, that reputation is somewhat
dated, and in fact today, you can get far more lethal
and far more intimidating weapons without even
triggering the application.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, do you think that
those State legislatures came to the conclusion that
there was a strong correlation between the possession of
a short-barreled shotgun and the use of that weapon in
committing crimes?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I think they may have come to
that conclusion.  I'm unaware of them doing so based on
data, Your Honor, including the Minnesota Act.  I am
unaware of even the National Firearms Act, when it was
adopted in 1934, relying on actual statistics about the
danger presented by this weapon --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think Congress --
MS. MENENDEZ::  -- as opposed to --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- had statistics before it
when it listed the specifically enumerated offenses in
the Armed Career Criminal Act?  Is this the sort of
thing with respect to which it is reasonable to expect
that there will be empirical evidence, or is this the
sort of thing, the sort of decision that legislatures
make based in -- on an impressionistic way and taking
into account common sense?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I don't know
whether Congress, when it passed the residual clause,
assumed that we would come to such statistical analysis
of the --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, when they said
burglary is a violent offense, do you think they had
statistics about the percentage of all burglar -- of all
burglaries that occur within the United States that
result in violence?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I don't believe so, Your
Honor.  I think burglary motivated the Armed Career
Criminal Act in the first place.  Burglary and robbery
seem to be the two -- the two predicate offenses that
most specifically the court -- I mean, I'm sorry,
Congress intended to include as triggering prior
offenses.  Why?  I think it's because they had the
belief that an armed burglar would be more dangerous
than an unarmed burglar and wanted to capture people who
were repeat and persistent property offenders who would
then later possess a gun.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if that is a
reasonable conclusion for the national legislature to
reach in enacting the Armed Career Criminal Act, why is
it not equally defensible for a State legislature to
make the same decision with respect to the illegal
possession of a sawed-off shotgun?
MS. MENENDEZ:  It's absolutely appropriate
for them to make that decision.  That should not control
this Court's decision about whether merely possessing
that unlawful weapon is a violent felony.  That decision
has to be governed by the residual clause language, and
it doesn't satisfy --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that that
judgment on the part of legislature is entitled to any
respect from this Court?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, certainly it
matters that some legislatures have chosen to ban it,
but I think it matters even more that most legislatures
and the United States Congress do not outlaw this
weapon.  They permit it to be possessed when lawfully
registered.  And even in 19 --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's what I'm
talking about, the cases where it is possessed
illegally, either because it is flatly banned or that it
is possessed by somebody who will not register it for
whatever reason, very possibly because that person
doesn't want it known that he or she possesses the
weapon.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Certainly, Your Honor.  Or
because they're unaware of the registration requirement,
which in almost every State will nonetheless make it a
criminal conduct, or because they're unaware of the
characteristics of the weapon that require it to be
registered, which in some States doesn't protect one
from the conviction.
Your Honor, I think it's important, if we're
using the opinion of legislatures and Congress to help
us determine whether this is a violent felony, it's
important to recognize that it is widely legal.
But you are right that the question before
the Court is the unlawful possession and whether
unlawful possession of a firearm is a violent felony.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What should we do if we
think that the reason that the legislature has made
possession unlawful is because the legislature believes
that possession will lead to a risk of physical injury?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I don't think
that answers the question.  I think the question has to
be grounded in the residual clause, and the residual
clause requires not just the possibility of future
injury, but that the offense itself, when examined
categorically and based on its element, creates a
substantial --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it says -- it says if
I use those words, I could repeat the same question and
say the reason that the legislature makes it unlawful to
possess a sawed-off shotgun is because the legislature
believes that the possession, that's the crime, presents
a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
That's why they made it unlawful.  What other reason
could there have been?  And therefore, their judgment is
the same words that the statute uses, but for the word
otherwise.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I -- I -- I don't
think there's any suggestion that either the Minnesota
legislature or the other minority legislatures that have
reached that conclusion did so based on an understanding --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What other reason would
they have had for making possession unlawful?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Because I think there's a
strong belief that firearms in general are unlawful,
that certain types of fire are -- are dangerous, that
certain types of firearms are more dangerous than
others, and that's appropriate.  We aren't saying these
should be legal.  We aren't saying these are --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I'm just saying what
other reason could they have had for making this a
crime, the possession --
MS. MENENDEZ:  Perhaps --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- unless they thought that
possession presents a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another?  I'm not suggesting an answer.  I
want to know what your answer is.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Perhaps they were, in fact,
adopting a different standard which is:  We, as the
Minnesota legislature, hypothetically, are going to ban
this weapon because we believe that it is somewhat more
dangerous than other weapons, and we would prefer it is
not possessed.  I don't think we can assume that they
went this far, and this is the question the Court has to
answer.
Also, Your Honor, the Michigan legislature,
for instance, obviously disagreed when they recently
changed their law to no longer prohibit mere possession
of a short-barreled shotgun.
I do think it is a recognition, Your Honor,
that legislatures think these are dangerous weapons, and
they are dangerous weapons, but that does not make their
mere possession violative of the residual clause of the
Armed Career Criminal Act.  I think it's very important
in every case that we tie the examination not to a
possible thing that could be done with the gun in the
future, but to the actual risk presented by mere
possession.  In the same way that in the James case the
Court was motivated by the fact that something more than
mere possession of burglary tools was required, here
something more than mere possession of the weapon should
be required.
We would be having a much different
conversation if we were talking about a different part
of Section 924 of Title 18, 924(c), which penalizes
using a weapon, even a short-barreled shotgun, during a
crime of violence.  That could certainly be a violent
felony.  But the mere possession --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You pointed out in your
brief that explosives -- one of the enumerated crimes is
use of explosives, but is no -- anywhere a crime of
possession.
MS. MENENDEZ:  That's correct, Your Honor,
and I'm glad you reminded me because that was an
important point for me to make, is that when we look at
these enumerated offenses as providing guidance for the
residual clause, it is very important that Congress
adopted use of explosives rather than possession.  And
in fact, in the legislative history, in 1986, they gave
examples of the sorts of things they believed would be
included by that provision, and it was not mere
possession of explosives.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Has any legislature
prohibited the possession of explosives?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I am sure that some have,
using certain language.
JUSTICE ALITO:  They just flatly prohibited,
within our State, you cannot possess any explosives.
Has any legislature done that?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I'm not aware of that, Your
Honor.  I apologize, I don't know.  I'm sure --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, do you think it's a
possibility that there are States in which explosives
cannot be used for demolition purposes?
MS. MENENDEZ:  No, I don't think that's
likely, Your Honor.  But nonetheless, Your Honor, when
Congress was adopting this language, they chose to put
"use of" prior to the term "explosives."  If they wanted
it to be more inclusive, they  could have certainly made
it more inclusive.  They did not.  In fact, the examples
given were the use of explosives to destroy energy
facilities or transportation facilities.
I see that I -- will reserve the rest of my
time for rebuttal, if I might.  Thank you, Your Honors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Bash.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN F. BASH
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES
MR. BASH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The ordinary case of possession of a
sawed-off shotgun is possession in connection with
serious criminal activity.  That is the judgment that
Congress, State legislatures, this Court in Miller and
Heller, and lower courts have reached for 8 decades.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If that's the case, how
many charges do you have that are for mere possession,
not involved with an underlying crime?
MR. BASH:  Most of these charges are brought
at the State level, so I don't have sort of the
comprehensive statistics.  But what I will point out is
that Petitioner has now had two briefs to come forward
with examples of law-abiding citizens just kind of
caught up in this sawed-off shotgun regime.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  She raises 14 cases in
her reply brief.
MR. BASH:  If you look at all of those
cases, Your Honor, the vast majority of them, both cited
in the opening brief and in the reply brief, involved
people involved in other very serious criminal activity,
meth dealing, sexual abuse, assaults.  So those cases
only verify what I think has been this Court's judgment
in Heller and Miller, Congress's judgment, the judgment
of State legislatures for a long time, that these are
exclusively used for unlawful purposes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why haven't they been
outlawed federally and why is it only a minority of
States that have outlawed their -- just their
possession, not their registration?
MR. BASH:  Because I think what the National
Firearm Act reflects, and this was reflected in Attorney
General Cummings' arguments in favor of the law when it
was under consideration, is that if you're willing to
disclose your fingerprints and photograph to the Federal
Government and undergo a background check -- that's only
by regulation, but undergo a background check, it
dissipates the chance that you're going to be involved
in crimes.
Gang members, terrorists, and bank robbers
do not go around disclosing their fingerprints and
photograph to the government.  So there are some
atypical gun collections who build collection of, I
think, rare firearms, and those are the sorts of
applications the ATF sees.
But I just want to emphasize the point
about, sort of, how many of these things are lawfully
registered.  We made a good faith attempt at an estimate
in our brief, and it's 140,000 lawfully registered ever.
It appears that the vast majority of those are to law
enforcement agencies or to the manufacturers themselves.
Just by way of comparison, the Congressional
Research Service put out a gun control analysis in 2012
that estimated that there are currently 82 million
shotguns of all varieties, either in private hands or
available for purchase by private citizens.  So the
number of -- whether it's 40,000, 50,000 ever, is a
vanishingly small number of sawed-off shotguns that have
been lawfully registered.  I think --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wasn't there something in
one of these briefs that a manufacturer in States where
these weapons are lawful has advertised them as ideal
for use in self-defense?
MR. BASH:  There is something like that in
one of the briefs.  I don't think a manufacturer's, sort
of, market strategy should govern the analysis.  It
certainly shouldn't refute this Court's judgment,
Congress's judgment, the judgment of State legislatures
for decades, that these weapons have no lawful uses.
And I am not aware of, for example, a spike in
applications for registrations for sawed-off shotguns to
the ATF, which you might expect to see if these weapons
were suddenly being in common use for self-defense.
I just wanted to address a point that I
think Justice Kagan raised with my friend, which was,
are we, sort of, solely relying on a correlative
relationship between the enumerated offense and the
potential for violence.  I think it's a great deal more
than a correlative relationship.  I think it's actually
precisely the same relationship between the crime and
the potential for violence present for burglary,
attempted burglary, extortion, which is to say this:
The enumerated crime enables the potential for violence
in a but-for causal sense, but the offender has to take
an additional act of volition to bring the violence to
fruition.
So, for example, with a burglary or an
attempted burglary, a burglar could say, if I'm
confronted by a homeowner or police officer, I am going
to flee.  I am not going to attack anybody or I am going
to give up.  The burglary enables that confrontation to
occur, but the offender has to take an additional act of
volition to actually bring violence to fruition.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I would think the analogy to
that is the person who uses the sawed-off shotgun in a
crime, but decides:  I'm not going to shoot it.  And
then you say:  It doesn't really matter if you're not
going to shoot it; you just used it in a criminal
activity, that's enough for us.
But this is a good deal more attenuated than
that because this person could, for whatever reason,
maybe because he wants to commit a crime in the future
or maybe he's one of the odd collectors or people who
think that this is good for self-defense, this person
could have kept it in a locked closet, in a safe deposit
box, and never have brought it out and never have any
potential for use in a crime.  I mean, it would be one
thing to say use in a crime causes enough risk of
serious injury, but this is a step further.
MR. BASH:  I agree that a necessary premise
of our argument is that the ordinary case of possession
is possession in connection with crimes.  So if you
don't buy that, we're in trouble.  But you should buy
that.  It's what this Court said in Heller when it said
short-barreled shotguns are not typically used by law
abiding citizens for lawful purposes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But they are two separate
offenses, right, possession of this gun and use of this
gun.  And you're converting the one into the other for
purposes of ACCA.
MR. BASH:  And that makes total sense, and
let me explain why.  If it wasn't like that, clause 2 of
the definition of violent felony -- it's at 11a of our
statutory appendix -- would do no work.  The whole point
of that clause is to capture situations that were
pregnant with the possibility of violence but where the
apprehender was offended before the violence occurred.
If an offender used a firearm against somebody, he would
be squarely within clause 1, which is the use of force
or the threatened or attempted use of force against
somebody.
The whole point of clause 2 is when you
catch someone who put themselves in the position to do
violence but the violence didn't materialize on that
occasion, they still fall within clause 2, and that
makes sense because that sort of behavior is reflective
of the armed career criminal.  I mean, this is the
weapon of choice historically, along with machine guns,
of the armed career criminal.  So it would be kind of
odd if the illegal possession of this weapon didn't
satisfy -- didn't count as a predicate under the Armed
Career Criminal Act.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think the same would
be true of a felon in possession?
MR. BASH:  No, and I think that's an
important difference.  I think the felon in possession
statute reflects a slightly different judgment.  It's
the judgment that someone who has committed a felony,
whether it's a violent felony or, you know, bank fraud
or something, has revealed themselves to be an
irresponsible person who can't be trusted with a
firearm.  I think in that sense, it's more prophylactic
in nature, but you certainly don't have --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I would  think that in the
felon -- a felon in possession law, I mean, honestly,
I'm sure the numbers dwarf the sawed-off shotguns, and
the whole point of that is, yes, they're people who have
shown themselves to be irresponsible, who have shown
themselves perhaps to use weapons irresponsibly, and
they're going to do it again, and there's a pretty
strong correlation of a kind of recidivism that makes
Congress pass that law.
MR. BASH:  I think that's an accurate
description of felon in possession, but there are,
nevertheless, felons who legitimately want a handgun,
which has been in common use for decades, for
self-defense or for target practice or whatever.
The judgment that this Court has rendered
and that Congress has rendered is that these weapons do
not have other purposes in the ordinary case, and I
think that distinguishes really a sawed-off shotgun
offense almost from any other --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Where did Congress say
that?  Where?  Where?  I mean, a felon in possession has
a gun, and you say he might keep it upstairs in his
closet, in the back of a car, in his hand, many places
he might possess it, and he might never use it for a
crime.  Recognizing that, you say that doesn't fall
within the statute.  Just substitute the words
"sawed-off shotgun."  In the closet, back of a car,
glass case, maybe in his hand, maybe in somebody else's
hand.  Maybe he just says to somebody:  I have a
sawed-off shotgun up there; give me your money.
All right?  All those things are possible
with either.  And so since they're possible with either,
on what basis do we write an opinion that says that you
win with the sawed-off shotgun, but you lose with almost
every other kind of gun.  What's our theory?  What lines
would there be in that opinion?
MR. BASH:  Here's the line.  When you have a
firearm that has historically been exclusively
associated with violence, unlike a handgun, but just
like a sawed-off shotgun --
JUSTICE BREYER:  My goodness, stop right
there for a second, because what we heard was there are
40,000 or more people in 10 States and others that don't
even make it unlawful.  So how can we say it's more
associated with crime than, what, a handgun or a
regular -- or a torpedo?  I don't know.
MR. BASH:  I think we would contend that
unlawful possession of a torpedo --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  I realized you were going
to say that, and all I put that in was to express my own
lack of knowledge of which is which, and therefore I
can't just speak ex cathedra and say this.  I would have
to have some proof.
MR. BASH:  I understand the uncertainty in a
case without empirical data.  It was the same
uncertainty that the Court had in James, where it said
we don't have empirical data to make the judgment.  And
in both James and Sykes, the Court said at the end of
the day in some of these ACCA cases we need to rely on
our common sense judgment.  But here I think what I hope
would be the Court's common sense judgment --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I don't -- I mean,
I've seen a lot of movies.  James Cagney used to, but I
can't use that.
MR. BASH:  Well, let me just say -- let me
just say where I -- where I think you can ground the
common sense judgment.  We've set forward in the brief
Federal statutes, State statutes, the legislative
history, Senate and House reports saying these weapons
are exclusively associated with lawbreaking and crime.
There is a history of that.  That's why they've been
regulated.  And I think, to go to a colloquy that my
colleague was having with one of the members of the
bench, the judgment of State legislatures and the
Federal Congress is not something sort of to be cast
away as the product of superstition.  State legislators,
Congresspeople, talk with their constituents, they speak
with law enforcement agencies.  They exercise reasonable
judgment based on the facts on the ground when they
enact laws like this.
And I don't think it can be really disputed,
as Justice Alito was alluding to earlier, that those
legislatures have made a judgment that these weapons are
exclusively associated with crime.  And I think that's a
much better factual record --
JUSTICE BREYER:  We couldn't say the same
thing with a Saturday night special?
MR. BASH:  I don't know.  I'm not familiar
with the term.
JUSTICE BREYER:  They used to be.  A
Saturday night special is a kind of pistol that was
really used very, very heavily with robberies and
crimes.  They were viewed -- that was one of the first
things that people tried to get banned after
assassinations and so forth.
MR. BASH:  I'm not saying that our argument
couldn't apply to any other weapons.  I imagine we'd
have a similar case on unlawful possession of machine
guns, for example.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How many --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  This isn't a
machine gun.  It's a pistol, a handgun.
MR. BASH:  We'd have to do the work.  I
don't mean to cut off --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.
MR. BASH:  We'd have to do the work.  Here I
think we have done the work.  We have a legislative and
judicial consensus over decades that these are
exclusively used in crimes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But we -- but we
know that's not true.  We know there are 40,000
registered that by -- and, you know, and you yourself I
think said or -- that if you're willing to give your
photograph and fingerprint or whatever to the Federal
Government, you're probably not going to use it
illegally.  So we know it's not true that these are
exclusively used in criminal activity.
MR. BASH:  Well, I think there's two points
in that.  One was the point I was alluding to earlier,
which is not only that Congress thinks sort of this
process ameliorates the -- the normal effect of
possession of a sawed-off shotgun and that these are
actually registered in extraordinarily small numbers
relative to total gun population.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what number
would be enough?  I mean if we had 100,000
registrations, does that mean that it's no longer
conduct that presents a serious potential risk?
MR. BASH:  I'm not sure.  I want to give you
two answers to that question.  I mean, the first is
that, as this Court said in James, the relevant data
point is convictions.  So there's no convictions for
lawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun.  The relevant
data point is how many convictions for unlawful
possession are associated with otherwise nonviolent
activity, and Petitioner hasn't really pointed to any
cases of sort of law-abiding citizens using them for
other reasons.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then -- then
is possession, possession of explosives, an offense
under this enhancement provision?
MR. BASH:  I think we'd run the same
analysis, and we talk about this at pages 47 to 48 of
our brief, which is to say explosives regulated by the
NFA, which are defined to be explosives designed as
weapons, yes, it's pretty much the same analysis we'd
run through which --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even though the
statute -- even though the statute says use of
explosives is covered?
MR. BASH:  And I don't think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You'd say, well,
under the catch-all phrase, mere possession is covered.
MR. BASH:  No.  And there's no redundancy,
because -- maybe we explained this unclearly.  What we
tried to explain is that the use of explosives would
encompass a felony conviction for the use of any
explosives.  So there are felony convictions for the use
of TNT or dynamite, explosives that are not inherently
dangerous in character, but could be used unlawfully.
The possession offense under the reasoning
that we've set forth in the brief would apply to
weaponized explosives, those regulated under the NFA
because they're designed as -- as weapons, napalm and
things like that, not to the unlawful possession of TNT,
even though the unlawful use of TNT would fall under the
use of explosives statute provided as a felony.  So I
don't think there's any redundancy created there.
And I guess just to wrap up this colloquy, I
think it's possible to imagine an alternative universe
where sawed-off shotguns developed as self-defense
weapons in ordinary use.  In that case, the ordinary
case analysis would look very different.  You would say,
well, maybe there are some people who unlawfully acquire
these, just like some people unlawfully acquire handguns
for self-defense.  But this Court has never recognized this,
this Court said very clearly in Heller in
distinguishing Miller, that these are not in lawful use
by law-abiding citizens.
That's not the way the real world looks.  In
the real world these are unlawfully possessed for use in
crime.  And once you accept that proposition, the final
step of our analysis is that when these items are
brought to crimes, it seriously increases the chance
that someone is going to be killed or wounded.  We've
set forth the characteristics of the weapon and the sort
of damage they do.  I won't repeat that.  But I don't
even really hear Petitioner to dispute that in the
ordinary case, when the -- in what we call the ordinary
case, when these are brought to crimes, they massively
increase the chance --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's a
second step, unlike the others.  When you're engaged in
a burglary, the -- the risk is there.  When it's mere
possession, the risk isn't there.  You have to take an
additional step of taking it and using it in a crime.
MR. BASH:  And I think burglary has the
exact same connection.  Burglar -- maybe it's easier to
see it with extortion, but the same analysis would apply
to burglary.  When you -- extortion, as defined most
narrowly, as Justice Scalia would have defined it in
James to be a threat of violence to person or property,
that itself does not create the possibility of violence.
It's only if the extortionist is willing to follow
through on the threat to take an additional step, just
like the additional step of using a firearm, that the
violence materializes.
So the sort of connection between the
underlying offense and violence that Congress had in
mind did contemplate an additional step by the offender
himself.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, or the
homeowner could happen to have a short-barreled shotgun
and shoot the burglar.
MR. BASH:  But remember --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Then the violence
doesn't depend on any additional act by the burglar.
MR. BASH:  It does, Mr. Chief Justice,
because the statute says violence to another.  So if
the -- if the homeowner clocks the burglar, that's not
the violence the statute contemplates.  And I suppose
you could imagine fanciful scenarios where the police
officer accidentally shoots the homeowner, but surely
that's not the sort of ordinary case violence that this
statute had in mind.
So I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the parallel
you're drawing is that burglary itself doesn't present a
risk of violence until the burglar pulls a gun?
MR. BASH:  Or -- or attacks the homeowner.
Like I said, I think it's most clear in extortion.  I
mean, even -- the Court suggested in James that
extortion could be even much broader to include
blackmail and sort of prototypical extortion.  But even
if we just accept Justice Scalia's view of extortion,
which is that it's a threat to person or property, there
must be some number of extortionists that say:  Well,
I'm going to make the threat, but I'm actually not going
to follow through on the threat.  And the violence --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the -- what
about the analogy to -- explosives, you say that there
could be lawful possession because explosives, it's use
that's given as an enumerated crime.
MR. BASH:  And what we would say is, by
parity of reasoning to what we've set forth in the brief
with respect to firearms, weaponized explosives, that is
to say explosives that only have a use as a weapon,
could fall under the residual clause.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there -- the proposition
then that I must accept I think for you to prevail is
possession of that which is normally used or has a very
serious risk of being used in a way that risks physical
injury to another falls within the statute.  And instead
of drawing a line between possession and some other use
of the thing, we say sometimes possession is in itself
within the statute, sometimes it's not.  If you possess
those things that have as a predominant use
participation in a matter that's likely to cause
physical injury to another, that's within the statute.
If that's the proposition, is there any case where
simple possession of anything has been interpreted as
falling within this language?  I don't know the answer
to that.
MR. BASH:  You mean circuit or Supreme Court
cases?
JUSTICE BREYER:  Any, any case.
MR. BASH:  Well, we won this.  We've won
this issue in --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I know -- you've won
this issue in --
MR. BASH:  In circuit courts.  I think the
Eighth Circuit and the First Circuit.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But it's this issue.
There's not some other area I could look at?
MR. BASH:  I think there's a case out of the
Fourth Circuit with possession of weapon in prisons.
Obviously the setting can change the analysis to some
degree.  But I believe there's a Fourth Circuit.  Maybe
my co -- my opponent will have a better recollection of
that.
JUSTICE BREYER:  There's a Fourth Circuit
case and then this line right here.  Okay.
MR. BASH:  I -- I don't mean to suggest that
there's no other cases.  I would not be surprised if
there were possession of machine gun and short-barreled
rifle and silencer; in other words, the very firearms
covered by the NFA.  Also, I think short-barreled
shotguns are, just to underscore the point, more often
used in crimes, and so you're going to see a
proliferation of cases there.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why not burglar tools?
Isn't it -- burglar tools are outside, right?
Possession of burglar tools will not get you under ACCA.
MR. BASH:  This Court reserved that question
in James in a footnote, because I think some States
purportedly had defined attempted burglary to be
something like possession or to include something like
possession of burglar tools.  I think we'd have a much
harder case there because there's a longer chain of
attenuation.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Pardon --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there's no other use.
There's no other use for burglar tools than in burglary.
MR. BASH:  I think that's true.  I think
we'd have to build through the practical case, one, that
burglar tools -- the mere possession of burglar tools is
sort of inevitably associated with committing burglary.
It may be that there's a lot of people who acquire them,
think about committing burglary, but don't make the sort
of attempt that James contemplated will result in a
confrontation, and then it's more attenuated because
you're linking up this burglary -- burglary tools with
committing burglary and then burglary with the
confrontation.
I think it's a much tighter nexus here.  I
think if you ask an ordinary congressperson whether they
think there's a tighter connection between possession of
a sawed-off shotgun and acts of violence rather than,
you know, possession of a crowbar and acts of violence,
I think most people would say, yes, that's sort of the
common sense answer that most legislators would give.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm a little still
confused about the felony possession, okay?  You say
that's not a crime of violence.  I -- I don't know how
to differentiate that from this because most felons, in
possession of a gun, I'm sure the statistics would show,
are committing crimes.  So if the question is the risk
of injury to others, it would be a felon possessing a
handgun of any kind and not a common citizen.  Because,
yes, common citizens more often than not, we hope, use
guns that they possess for lawful purposes; but felons,
I would think, just as a matter of logic, what Justice
Alito was asking, that felons more often than not use
guns in illegal activities.
MR. BASH:  I -- I don't know.  And for
one -- for one thing, we have a -- the judgment of the
sentencing commission here that we're in full accord
with that possession of a sawed-off shotgun is
fundamentally different than felony possession.
And they see --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I understand that.
I just want you to give me some sort of analytical
approach on when to judge that -- when to judge that
risk, or how to differentiate that risk --
MR. BASH:  I think the analytical --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- so that everything,
no -- every possession crime doesn't become a crime of
violence.
MR. BASH:  I understand the concern.  And I
think the analytical line to draw is that weapons that
by their nature are exclusively associated, or in the
ordinary case, associated with violent crimes count
under ACCA.  I don't think that the felon in possession
statute reflects quite the judgment that every felon
that possesses a firearm is going to commit acts of
violence with it.  I think it reflects the sort of
prophylactic concern that these folks have proven
themselves irresponsible lawbreakers -- even if they
committed a nonviolence felony and they've, you know,
lost their ability to responsibly care for firearms and
to handle firearms.  I do think it's a different
judgment than the judgment of why people can't
unlawfully possess mortars and artillery pieces and
torpedoes and -- and sawed-off rifles and shotguns and
machine guns.  I think it's a different judgment.
The Court -- Petitioner has really not
refuted the historical understanding that these are
uniquely and purely associated with crime.  And I think
a few thousand registrations since 1934, lawfully, does
not refute the common sense conclusion that the unlawful
possession of a sawed-off shotgun is associated with
crime.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That -- you're -- is
that the 40,000 you're talking about?
MR. BASH:  I'm sorry --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you say a few
thousand, is that the same statistic as --
MR. BASH:  Yes.  And I'll just say it's
140,000; we think it's a great deal lower than that.
That's the total number of registrations since 1934.  As
we say in the brief, we can't have perfect certainty,
but it appears that the majority are registered with law
enforcement or manufacturers.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I might have used a
different word than a few thousand.
MR. BASH:  Forgive me, a few ten thousand
or --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, that would --
(Laughter.)
MR. BASH:  A few dozen thousand.
JUSTICE ALITO:  In the Armed Career Criminal
Act in general, and the residual clause in particular,
has caused no end of problems for this Court.  Are you
aware of any efforts made by the Justice Department to
propose legislation revising either the -- either the
Act in general or the residual clause?
MR. BASH:  I am not aware of those efforts.
That doesn't mean they don't exist, but I, standing
here, am not aware of the efforts.  But I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What would you think, which
I once suggested and certainly didn't have the nerve to
follow through, that it's more likely that the
Department of Justice, with the aid of the sentencing
commission, could get the relevant statistics than it is
that a defendant could.  So if no statistics appear, we
should draw a presumption against the department.
MR. BASH:  Well, this Court has held
otherwise in James.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes.  I realize that.
MR. BASH:  So, I mean, I think that's a
statutory stare decisis holding that -- that governs --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But could you do something,
that is to say, even without legislation?  Is it
possible that the department, through its statistical
gathering resources, and it has some, working with the
sentencing commission, could help us more on the -- on
the underlying statistical data that would give us a
clue as to what was dangerous and what was not?
MR. BASH:  I think -- I think that's
conceivable.  I'm not familiar with all the sort of
statistical resources of the Department of Justice.  But
I just want to emphasize, this is the clear case.  This
is the case where Congress and State legislatures and
this Court in Heller and Miller have said for decades.
So I don't think there's a fair argument that criminals
are not on notice that possession of an unlawful shotgun
can carry very serious consequences.  Maybe in a closer
case down the road you say, well, the department could
have come up with statistics, and that would be -- you
know, we're going to rule against the department for
that reason.  But, I mean, we have a quote from Judge
Boudin in the brief in the Shaw case, where, you know,
anyone that watches television or reads the newspaper
knows that these are especially associated with crimes.
So I don't think it came as a surprise to Mr. Johnson
that when he commits two robberies and one illegal
possession of a sawed-off shotgun, eventually that's
going to catch up with him.
If the Court has no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Menendez, you have four minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE M. MENENDEZ
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. MENENDEZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Just briefly.  You're -- with respect to
Justice Breyer's question, there are a couple of related
contexts where there are some appellate decisions.  The
Eighth Circuit in Archer, which is cited in our brief,
has held that possession of a concealed weapon is not a
violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act.
In addition, in the Fourth -- I'm sorry, the
Ninth Circuit in a case called Fish, which I am not sure
whether we've cited it in our brief, but it's a 2004
decision, held that possession of a pipe bomb was not a
crime of violence under the sentencing guideline
provision, not the Armed Career Criminal Act.
And I do agree with my opposing counsel that
there's been one decision that went the way we disagree
with in the Fourth Circuit about possession of a weapon
in prison, which I think is a very different
circumstance.
Your Honors, I do think that it's important
to look at James, comparing attempted burglary as to
burglary.  I think it gives us a great deal of guidance.
In James, the Court found that there wasn't any textual
justification for treating those differently.  Here we
have a very clear textual justification in terms of use
of explosives, which gives us a strong signal that mere
possession wasn't contemplated.  The government invites
this Court to do pretty convoluted reasoning, adopting
an unstated definition from a totally unrelated statute
in Title 26.  And assuming that Congress meant when it
said use of explosives, that all things listed in the
National Firearms Act would be included by mere
possession, I don't think we can make that leap.
Your Honors, it's also not true that there
is a unanimous belief that these are inherently
unjustifiable weapons.  In fact, I think that the fact
is most legislatures allow these to be possessed in some
context or another, and Michigan has just indicated that
perhaps the old historical reputation of this weapon is
no longer deserved.  But this Court doesn't have to like
the short-barreled shotgun or decide that it's even an
appropriate weapon for punish -- or for possession in
order to agree that we can't assume from its possession
alone that someone has only nefarious purpose.
In addition, Your Honors, the relevant
analysis has to begin with the offense.  And the
government tries over and over again to say, well, it's
obvious that these would only be possessed for nefarious
reason, but they cannot substantiate that.  They
disagree with the 14 cases I encourage the Court to look
at from page 14 of our reply brief, that those are mere
possession cases.  By characterizing the people who
possessed those weapons, they were found during the
course of investigations of other crimes, but that
doesn't mean a single one of those possession acts was
actually possession during a crime.  And this Court
certainly can't assume that merely because a criminal or
a bad person had possessed the weapon, that they
possessed it for nefarious purposes.
Finally, Your Honors, I would really
encourage the Court to consider the -- the rule of
lenity and its application in this case.  The government
has not brought statistics nor clear, decisive, textual
argument that mandate the application of one of the most
onerous sentencing provisions that we see in Federal
courts every day.  This statute is applied to 600 people
a year.  It lacks all clarity.  And while this Court
need not get into whether it is unconstitutionally vague
and the baby should go out with the bath water, the
Court can certainly decide that Congress did not speak
clearly on this question, and that it should not be
applied to Mr. Johnson.
Unless there are any further questions, I
appreciate the opportunity to present argument.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the
