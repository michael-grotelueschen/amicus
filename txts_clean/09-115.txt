Commerce v. Whiting.
Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
In 1986, Congress converted what had been
before that time a merely peripheral concern of
immigration policy -- that is, how to regulate worker
authorization -- and converted it into a core concern of
immigration policy by the passage of the -- of the
Immigration Reform and Control Act.
This Court has characterized that change in
legislation as providing a comprehensive scheme for
dealing with those issues, and that characterization is
obviously apt because Congress provided for an
exhaustive and exclusively Federal method of bringing to
the attention of Federal authorities problems in worker
authorization, the method by which those matters should
be investigated, the method by which they should be
adjudicated, all of which are controlled as a matter of
Federal -- exclusive Federal activity; and, indeed, the
ultimate judicial review goes exclusively to the Federal
courts of appeals.
The sanctioning provisions are very explicit
and they're very clear and they are very balanced; and
for a good reason. Congress realized in this context
that if you over-enforce in one direction -- that is, if
you try to deter the hiring of unauthorized workers --
you run a very serious risk of causing employers to err
on the side of not hiring others who are in fact
authorized but who may fall into protected classes. And
so Congress very carefully calibrated the penalties on
both sides so that the employer essentially would play
it straight down the middle and hire the best people for
the job under these circumstances, while, of course,
complying if at all possible with the Federal
requirements.
And so it's against that backdrop --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is that a
problem if, as -- as the Federal statute requires and
the State statutes require, you have to show an intent
to hire an unauthorized worker? Isn't -- isn't that
what the State statutes here require?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the State statute has
two components to it. One is knowing and one is intent.
But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. PHILLIPS: But I don't see how that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so why is that a
problem for -- for the business? I mean he's safe so
long as he doesn't intentionally hire an unauthorized
worker.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think part of the
problem is that there -- it is never 100 percent clear
precisely who is and who is not an authorized worker.
And I think what Congress said was -- I'm not going to
deal with this problem in the kind of granular way
you're looking at it, Justice Scalia, which is
specifically at each of the individual employment
decisions. I'm going to look at the generality of
situations, and realize that if you put in -- on one
side of the scale what Arizona has done here, which is
to say you can -- you can essentially have the death
penalty to the business, that is, complete eliminate the
business's right to exist, and, on the other side of the
scale, a $250 fine, it would -- it would be pretty
remarkable to say, well, I -- you know, I'm going to
hide behind the intent and knowing requirements and,
instead, simply avoid if at all possible the risk of
Arizona's sanctions being imposed upon me.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think what Arizona
would answer to that is: Well, that's the only option
the Federal Government left us.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm quite sure that
that's what Arizona will say.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They excluded everything
else. We might have used reticulated penalties or, you
know, enforced the Federal law ourselves, but they
forbade that. But they did allow us to enforce the law,
immigration laws, through licensing, right? So it all
essentially comes down to -- to the licensing issue,
doesn't it?
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. It does ultimately
does come down to the "through licensing" laws and --
the -- the part of the -- and the fundamental problem,
obviously, with Arizona's scheme here is that this is
not a licensing law. This is a worker authorization
sanctioning law.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, when I picked up
this -- this brief and looked at this case, I thought:
Oh, well, licensing, that's a defined term; I'll look in
Corpus Juris Secundum or ALR or something. But it
really isn't. Your brief indicates you start with
dictionaries, fair enough. You indicate what Federal
licensing laws are. But I see no limitation on what the
State can decide is a license in any jurisprudential
principle that you've cited.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Justice Kennedy, I
think the better way to try to -- to grapple with the
meaning of the licensing law or whether it ought to be
construed broadly to allow the State wide authority to
engage in supplemental enforcement in this, or narrowly
in order to say that what really ought to happen in this
context is, if you deal with a situation where the
Federal Government has enacted -- I'm sorry -- has
enforced a provision and imposed a penalty through the
Federal scheme, that then as a supplement to that the
State does in fact have the authority to add something
over and above what it -- what the Federal Government
has done.
But it seems to me quite remarkable to think
that Congress intended through a parenthetical referring
to "through licensing laws" to allow the State to adopt
an entire alternative shadow enforcement mechanism, a
non-administrative decision-making process, completely a
State-run operation; and even at the end, the sanction
is not -- is not imposed ultimately in effect by the --
by any regulating entity. It is ordered by a State
court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be possible only
because nobody would think that, with this scheme in
place, the Federal Government would not enforce it. Of
course, no one would have expected that. But what
Arizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in
place has not been enforced, and Arizona and other
States are in serious trouble financially and for other
reasons because of -- of unrestrained immigration. And,
therefore, they had to take this very massive -- I agree
this step is massive, and one wouldn't have expected it
to occur under this statute, but expectations change
when the Federal Government has -- has simply not
enforced the immigration restrictions.
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia, I -- I
understand the point, and I understand the motivation
for why Arizona did what it did. But the -- the problem
is the statute was enacted in 1986, and that's when the
pre-emption standards were put in place. And the --
again, the notion -- if you look at the way the
structure of the statute -- and this also responds in
some ways to Justice Kennedy's question about how should
you read licensing, since it's not a self-defining
concept -- is if you -- is that, first, Congress said
very specifically that the immigration laws should be
enforced uniformly, which says that there shouldn't be
,000 different localities offering up their view of
licensing and -- and the additional 50 States.
Second of all, and this part I think is
particularly telling in terms of this massive State
scheme that's been adopted, which is that under section
24a(b)(5), which is in 134a of the -- of the appendix,
Congress specifically outlaws the use of the I-9 form.
And in some ways this goes to your question,
Justice Scalia, because it would be inconceivable that
the State can in fact enforce knowing and intentional
decision making without having access to the I-9 form,
because that's --
JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this
question to get back --
MR. PHILLIPS: Sure.
JUSTICE ALITO: -- to the issue of whether
this is a licensing law? "Licensing" is not an unknown
term. States and municipalities issue all sorts of
licenses. For example, I think here in the District of
Columbia every business has to have a general business
license; isn't that right?
MR. PHILLIPS: That is true, Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO: Now, if the District of
Columbia were -- after having enacted this requirement
some years ago, were to pass a new ordinance saying "and
if you knowingly hire an illegal alien, your general
business license can be forfeited," would that not --
would that cease to be a licensing law?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I think the answer
to that specific hypothetical is that's still not a
licensing law, because it doesn't tie the grant of the
license to the revocation powers. I think Congress -- I
think Congress means for the States to adopt something
more specific than that, although I do think
eventually --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why is it -- this is
the same question you're answering. Why is it suddenly
not a license because the -- because the State imposes
an additional condition, where it was a license before?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I --
MR. PHILLIPS: I think the question is
whether it is a licensing law within the meaning of what
Congress intended. I mean -- the -- the reality is,
Justice Alito, there -- there is no common definition of
"license," and various States and local --
JUSTICE BREYER: Actually, there is. I
mean, it seemed to me when I read this, it sounded a
little familiar, and I think whoever wrote it in Arizona
copied it out of the Administrative Procedure Act. I
mean, you read the definition of "license" in the
Administrative Procedure Act --
MR. PHILLIPS: But --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and this is awfully
close.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I understand that,
Justice Breyer, and I agree with that. But the problem
is, is that the -- the Federal law, it doesn't talk
about actions with -- with respect to licenses. It
talks about licensing laws and --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's right. It might
have meant something different; Congress might have.
But what is, then -- I read the SEIU brief. I thought
that was pretty interesting. Is that something you
adopt as what the Congress did mean? I mean, what do
you think Congress did mean, and what evidence is
there -- if it didn't mean the APA definition, what
evidence is there for that?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the SEIU brief does a
very nice job of explaining the -- the particular focus
of Congress, obviously, on the -- on the Agricultural
Workers Protection Act, and in particular -- which, you
know, has tremendous significance in terms of narrowing
the State's authority here, because, obviously, in their
conforming amendments in that context --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It could have named that,
if that's all it meant.
MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It could have named that,
that particular licensing scheme, if that's what it
meant. But it didn't name it; it said licensing
generally.
What did it intend to add to that? Barbers'
licenses?
MR. PHILLIPS: No, I think what --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Beauticians' licenses?
MR. PHILLIPS: Of course.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How would any of this have
anything to do with the immigration laws?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what it -- what
Congress actually had in mind and what's the most
natural reading of a licensing law is the fairly common
situation where somebody violates Federal law, usually
on the criminal side, and a State licensing entity finds
out about a conviction of a Federal crime, and says:
Oh, wait a second, we don't want people to have licenses
under these circumstances, and, therefore, they --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But they're saying --
that's exactly what they are saying. We -- we have --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, no. But,
Justice Scalia, there's a vast difference between that
and what they're saying.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's very common to
talk about authority to do business within a State as --
as a license. You say "licensed to do business in" so
many States. It's a common expression.
Now, I have -- maybe you'll persuade me
otherwise, but I have no doubt that insofar as this law
limits the authority to do business within the State, it
is a -- it is a licensing law. It's a little harder
extending licensing to formation of a corporation, but
when you issue a corporation charter you really do two
things. You create the corporation and enable the
limitation of liability that creates, and secondly, you
authorize that new creature to do business within your
State. So at least half of that corporation law is
licensing, it seems to me.
Now, if that's what I think, what --
MR. PHILLIPS: Actually, Justice Scalia, can
I stop you there?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Go on.
MR. PHILLIPS: Because I think, actually, if
you just -- if you just receive the articles of
incorporation, that doesn't actually in all States
necessarily give you the opportunity to do business. It
just simply gives you the right to exist, and you may
very well need to get a separate document in order to
actually do business in a particular State.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- but you do not need
the kind of a document that an out-of-State corporation
needs --
MR. PHILLIPS: No, you don't need that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you're an in-State
corporation.
Mr. PHILLIPS: That's true. That's true.
But the -- but the reality is that nobody, I think --
and common sense and common use of the term, thinks of
articles of incorporation or the charter of a
partnership or any of those as -- documents as
licensing, which suggests that the State --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- could I --
MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- just -- just focus
the questioning? Because we keep talking about whether
the APA-type definition of licensing is what Congress
intended or not, but you don't disagree that Congress at
least intended that if someone violated the Federal law
and hired illegal aliens and was -- undocumented aliens
and was found to have violated it, that the State can
revoke their license, correct?
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to do business?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I don't disagree with
that, Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it really doesn't
matter whether they're revoking their right to do
business in the State. And they can only revoke their
charter or their articles of incorporation if they're --
if they were filed in that State. They wouldn't have
power to revoke a Delaware --
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. They can't do it --
they can't do it to Delaware, right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So it's
stopping them from doing business. So really the only
conflict you're talking about is not the power to stop
them from doing business, because you accept that this
saving clause gives them the power to do that, to revoke
the right to do business; what you're talking about is a
conflict in the adjudication of that issue.
MR. PHILLIPS: And --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that correct?
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and the enforcement
and investigation.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So I'm --
you know, how they define "license" or not is irrelevant
to me. Walk me through whether -- what expressly
pre-empts that adjudication right --
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- or what implicitly
pre-empts that adjudication right.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because that is, for me,
what the center of this question is.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think there are
three pieces of evidence that respond directly to what
you asked, Justice Sotomayor.
First is Congress, in section 115 of the
statute, specifically says enforcement should be
uniform, which suggests to me that this ought to be
exclusively a Federal investigation and -- and
adjudication process.
Two, the point I was making earlier about
the I-9 form. Those forms cannot be used in any
location --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Don't depart
from that. What does that mean, "enforcement shall be
uniform"?
MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SCALIA: What does that mean,
"enforcement shall be uniform"?
MR. PHILLIPS: The enforcement of the
immigration laws shall be uniform. Congress stated that
as a -- as an overarching principle --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that any different
from --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- when it enacted section
5.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- from what is the assumed
situation with respect to all Federal laws?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, not necessarily.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are Federal laws not to be
applied uniformly.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, I -- I mean, I
think it depends on the circumstances. I can imagine a
lot of -- I mean, this is -- remember, we're talking
about immigration policy and immigration law here, and
in general, you would expect that to be pretty much
uniform. But this Court in De Canas had decided that
there are some elements of it that were not, and
Congress is simply reinforcing the basic notion that
enforcement of it ought to be uniform to --
JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the exception for
licensing mean that this isn't going to be completely
uniform? One -- one jurisdiction may take the position
that a restaurant that employs illegal aliens may lose
its restaurant -- its license to operate. Another one
may take the different position.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE ALITO: So it's not going to be the
same.
MR. PHILLIPS: But -- but, Justice Alito, I
think that's why it's terribly important to limit, to
narrow as much as possible -- and it's fully consistent
with congressional intent --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they say that
these --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- the need to get a full
sanction done by the Federal Government and then just an
add-on on the licensing side, rather than an entire
regime to enforce State law.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this is -- it can't
be uniformity of sanction, because the court permitted
licensing sanctions.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, there -- but only at
that point.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let's go back to my
question of adjudication. What you're saying is what's
specifically pre-empted is the right to adjudicate --
MR. PHILLIPS: Investigate --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whether someone has
hired undocumented aliens, correct?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Sotomayor.
And -- and the last thing I would say with respect to
that was the conforming amendments with respect to the
Agricultural Workers Protection Act, there's a situation
where the Department of Labor, which used to engage in
adjudication as well, was divested of that authority.
It seems quite unlikely Congress meant to give that
authority to the States and take it from the Department
of Labor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see the problem in
-- in diverse adjudication. Wouldn't there be a Federal
question presented if a -- if a company claimed that it
was deprived of the ability to do business because of a
mistaken interpretation of Federal law, that the person
it hired was not an authorized person?
MR. PHILLIPS: But Arizona doesn't
purport --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't that be a Federal
question that -- that could be --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Arizona doesn't purport
to be enforcing Federal law here. It has an independent
State law basis for the actions that it takes. So that
would not arise under Federal law, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the State law basis
refer to the Federal law?
MR. PHILLIPS: No, it -- actually, I don't
think it --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it tracked it.
MR. PHILLIPS: No, it -- well, it tracks it,
but it doesn't incorporate it. It doesn't purport to be
-- to be applying it. It's the same standards, but it's
still a matter of State law. It's not a Federal -- it's
not Federal -- it doesn't arise under Federal law.
I'd like to reserve --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
GENERAL KATYAL: Thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
Nearly a quarter of a century ago, Congress
declared Federal employer sanctions central, not
peripheral, to the policy of immigration law. Congress
broadly swept away State and local laws, pre-empting any
sanction upon those who employ unauthorized aliens, with
the sole exception being a mere parenthetical for
licensing and similar laws.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to pose there,
we've had a little discussion about what licensing laws
are, but we haven't talked at all about those last two
words, "and similar laws." It seems to me that whatever
wiggle room or ambiguity there may be in saying whether
this is a license or not, Congress swept pretty broadly.
It said, not just licensing laws, but licensing and
similar laws.
GENERAL KATYAL: First let me tell you,
Mr. Chief Justice, what we think a licensing law is and
then deal with the "similar" question.
We think a licensing law, as Congress
defined it in IRCA, was the traditional licensing laws
that were in place in 1986. Those were largely farm
labor contractor laws. They were aimed at fitness to do
business, and they had a few essential characteristics
in those laws. They --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Let me
just -- I mean, businesses had to have licensing laws
pretty much across the board, right? You couldn't set
up a -- I don't know -- an electrical contracting
business if you didn't -- weren't licensed to do
business or met the requirements for an electrician. It
wasn't just agricultural work.
GENERAL KATYAL: Oh, absolutely. And -- but
I think that this licensing law looks very different
from the ones you were referring to or the farm labor
contractor ones, for a number of reasons. The first is
licensing laws issue licenses. They're generally about
the issuance of licenses, not simply ones in which
licenses are revoked. Second, they are ones in which
the issuance of the license, the criteria for issuance,
is the same as the criteria for revocation, because
they're --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You -- are you
saying, and I think the Petitioner here may have been
saying as well, that if you have a licensing law that
permits the revocation of the license, the revocation is
not a licensing law?
GENERAL KATYAL: No. What I'm saying is,
is that a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I have a licensing
law which says if you do this, your license will be
revoked. Does that remain a licensing law?
GENERAL KATYAL: In general, that itself is
not a licensing law. The licensing laws share a number
of characteristics. Now, we can debate about whether
subtracting one or another of those characteristics --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why make exception for
licensing laws therefore if you can't revoke a license
under it?
GENERAL KATYAL: Because -- because,
Justice Scalia, Congress wanted to preserve the States'
traditional power for licensing laws, which were about
fitness to do business. And what Arizona has done --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Once you're in, you can do
whatever you like. Do you think that is what Congress
meant? You can -- you can pass upon their fitness when
you issue the license, but once its issued, they can do
whatever they like; is that right?
GENERAL KATYAL: No. I think that the
criteria would be the same for issuance and revocation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And revocation. Okay. So
that raises the question: What does it make -- why does
it make any difference if the revocation provision is
contained in the narrow licensing law or if there's a
general State law which says all licenses that -- that
are issued may be revoked for certain reasons?
GENERAL KATYAL: Because, Justice Scalia,
what Congress was trying to do was preserve the States'
and localities' traditional power for fitness to do
business. And one good indicia that fitness to do
business is not was what at issue in the particular law
is that they will let businesses operate, they will
license them without any care whatsoever as to whether
they have a history of violating the particular
provisions --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So they should just --
Arizona should just amend all its licensing laws to
require what they now require when the license is
issued, and to say, in each specific licensing law, that
it can be revoked for the same -- on the same grounds --
GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that would
solve that problem.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That would solve the
problem.
GENERAL KATYAL: Now, there are other --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if they said --
GENERAL KATYAL: -- hallmarks of licensing
law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if they said
"and you have to renew your license every year or every
months"?
GENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. That
itself, I don't think, is relevant to whether the
licensing law is -- the other hallmarks are that they
have discretionary adjudication by an expert body, that
it's not mandatory, that it is genuinely aimed at
qualifications to do business. It --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't disagree
that whether or not a company hires illegal workers is
related to quality or -- or ability to do business or
qualification?
GENERAL KATYAL: A State could certainly
make that part of its genuine fitness to do business
law. Now, here Arizona hasn't done that. And we know
that because the criteria for issuance of the license
are entirely divorced from the criteria for revocation
of the license. And if Arizona really believed,
Mr. Chief Justice, what you're saying, which is that
it's relevant to the -- the violation is relevant to
whether they can do business or not, they allow every
single one of these entities to get the license.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your argument sounds to
me like look at the law and see what its purpose is. If
the purpose is to regulate undocumented aliens, then
it's struck down. If it happens to put its revocation
provisions in its licensing law, then it's okay.
GENERAL KATYAL: Justice --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't make much
sense --
GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, I'm not
talking about purpose. I'm saying look at the face of
the statute and see what is being --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The face of the statute
talks only about if you hire undocumented aliens, your
license is revoked.
GENERAL KATYAL: Right. So that looks like
a punishment statute. There are essentially two boxes
here. There is the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the -- the saving
clause says that it's okay. Civil or criminal sanctions
other than through licensing and similar laws. So, I
mean --
GENERAL KATYAL: Right. And this is not a
licensing law. Congress essentially had two boxes in
86. One was the traditional fitness to do business
laws, and the other was what Congress --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we disagree with you,
could you answer the question I posed to your adversary,
which is what makes the adjudication of status
pre-empted?
GENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. The Federal
adjudication is expressly -- State adjudication of a
Federal violation is expressly pre-empted as well as
impliedly so for three reasons. The first is that
Congress, in developing IRCA and the comprehensive
scheme, set out a series of procedures, Federal
adjudication with an ALJ, all sorts of different
regulations to the jot and tittle. And what Arizona
does here is what 40,000 different localities can do if
this law is upheld, which is have --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At the time the statute
was passed, there were many, many State laws that
adjudicated revocation of licenses. Perhaps not many
had addressed the issue of hiring undocumented aliens,
but many State laws existed that independently
adjudicated revocations. What in the legislative
history or in the words of the statute show that
Congress intended in any way to limit those
adjudications?
GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's undoubtedly the
case that without the parenthetical, the mere
parenthetical savings clause, that Arizona-like laws
would be swept away as sanctions, that these are
sanctions imposed. So the question is whether the
licensing law phrase saves that. And I think it saves
the Federal -- State adjudication, and I think the
answer to that is no, because to read the statute that
way is to permit all of those States to have their own
laws, and it's undoubtedly the case that Congress wanted
to sweep away the De Canas-style State statutes that
were in place that imposed sanctions on employers. And
so the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, just so I
get -- make sure I understand your approach. You're
saying that Arizona had a law saying you have to have a
license to do business, and then it became aware of a
problem it wasn't aware of before -- it found out that a
lot of employers were employing child labor, and they
didn't know they would do that -- and they say we can
revoke your license if you're determined to have
employed child labor; that that would not be okay?
GENERAL KATYAL: Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it would be okay
if, in the original licensing thing, they said "and you
can't employ child labor"?
GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think that the
answer depends on what Congress was trying to get at.
In 1986, we know what Congress was trying to get at with
respect to State enforcement of immigration laws. They
broadly swept away the De Canas-style laws, and they
said, for the I-9 provision, which President Reagan
described as the keystone of the Act, that I-9 documents
can't be used in any procedure besides IRCA procedures.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Chief Justice --
the Chief Justice can insist on the answer to his own
question, but it seems to me his question is why isn't
that still a licensing law?
GENERAL KATYAL: If it has independent
adjudication, it is swept away by the first parts of the
(h)(2) statute which say -- which say the provisions of
this section pre-empt any State or local law imposing
civil or criminal sanctions.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then, what --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in the child labor
example, why isn't that a -- an addition to a regulatory
licensing scheme so that it's a licensing law?
GENERAL KATYAL: Because if I understand --
I may not understand the hypothetical, but the word
"provisions" refers to the entire subset -- the entire
statute in IRCA, including the procedural protections --
the procedures that follow for Federal enforcement of
the immigration laws.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Would you --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you had --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- read that section again?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to
say you tried earlier to talk about the two boxes, and
you said something would be pre-empted by the first
clause. Anything -- civil and criminal sanctions are
allowed if they're imposed through licensing and similar
laws. There are not two boxes. The State can do what's
in the first part so long as it does it through
licensing or similar laws.
GENERAL KATYAL: Right. And our -- and our
position is that this is not a licensing law because it
doesn't bear any of the indicia of a traditional
licensing law, and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it similar to a
licensing law?
GENERAL KATYAL: No, I don't think so, that
Congress -- Congress had in the -- when they used
"similar" meant to sidestep the schematic debate about
whether something is a certificate, as some of the farm
labor contractor statutes use that term, or a license.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, that's all right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. O'Grady.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY R. O'GRADY
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. O'GRADY: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Through their police powers, States
traditionally have the authority to regulate the conduct
of employers within their jurisdiction to determine what
conduct warrants issuance of a State license and to
determine what conduct justifies suspending or revoking
such a license. And although Congress pre-empted some
of our traditional authority when it enacted IRCA in
86, it preserved significant State authority through
the savings clause that permits a State to impose
sanctions through licensing and similar laws.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the --
the anomaly that Arizona cannot impose a fine even in a
modest amount, but it can revoke someone's license to do
business?
MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, we think that
looking at the savings clause -- we don't view it as an
anomaly. The structure that Congress established is one
that the State's authority is determined by the nature
of the sanction that we choose to impose. We don't have
the authority to -- they -- they took away our authority
to impose civil monetary and criminal sanctions but
preserved our authority to impose sanctions through a
similar law.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But underlying Justice
Ginsburg's question is why would Congress want to do
that?
MS. O'GRADY: Well, I think it makes sense,
Your Honor, because in terms of licensing, it -- it
provides some accountability, because we are the
entities that establish policy for our licensees, and we
are the ones accountable for whether that business
remains in business or whether we're taking it away from
them. So it --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Perhaps Congress never
expected that the States would have to resort to such
massive measures, and they probably wouldn't have if --
if the law had been uniformly enforced and vigorously
enforced, right?
You -- you didn't -- didn't have any notion
of doing this sort of thing in 1986, did you?
MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, certainly we
waited until 2007.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So maybe Congress wasn't
worried about it because it seemed very unlikely that
anything like that would occur.
MS. O'GRADY: Perhaps. But I think also
Congress was recognizing what this Court recognized in
De Canas, was that unauthorized employment has
significant local consequences, so they did not want to
fully pre-empt State law. They wanted to preserve State
authority --
JUSTICE BREYER: The main -- the main
anomaly seemed to me to be this, that in the Federal
Act, as -- that was the first point that the Chamber
made, that it's a fairly careful balance. There are a
group of people in Arizona, they may look as if they
come from Mexico or speak with an Hispanic accent, and
you're not certain whether they in fact are illegals or
that they're legal. Now, think of that category.
Congress has passed a statute that gives the
employer just as much incentive to verify, so there's no
discrimination, as to dismiss, so there's no illegal
hiring. It's absolutely balanced. A $1,000 fine for
the one, a $1,000 fine for the other.
So Arizona comes along and says: I'll tell
you what, if you discriminate, you know what happens to
you? Nothing. But if you hire an illegal immigrant,
your business is dead.
That's just one thing they do. Now, how can
you reconcile that intent to prevent discrimination
against people because of their appearance or accent --
how do you reconcile that with Arizona's law?
If you're a businessman, every incentive
under that law is to call close questions against hiring
this person. Under the Federal law, every incentive is
to look at it carefully.
MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, a couple of
points. First, in terms of how our law works, we do
have a prohibition against investigating any complaint
that's based solely on race. So if we get a complaint
that says those people all look Mexican or Hispanic,
that does not get investigated under Arizona law, first.
We also have criminal penalties if frivolous complaints
are filed.
Beyond that, we have the use of E-Verify,
which is an added protection for employers to prevent
the hiring of unauthorized aliens. So if they use
E-Verify, if they're in good-faith compliance with the
I-9 process, they have no risk of exposure under Arizona
law, just as true under Federal law.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- doesn't it
frustrate the congressional intent when the Federal law
says that the I-9 can be used for no purpose other than
the Federal adjudication of whether a violation has
occurred or not? Doesn't it frustrate that law to have
the States raise a defense that depends on forcing
someone to disclose something that the Federal law
protects?
I mean, this is a vicious circle. Federal
law says you can't do the I-9 for -- you can't use it
for any purpose other than the Federal adjudication.
Now you're creating a defense that says you have to
supply us with something that Federal law otherwise
protects from disclosure.
MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, we don't think
that the Federal law prohibits the use of an I-9 -- of
the I-9 -- an employer's use of the I-9 in a State
proceeding, that these can be used under the Federal
proceeding or under the State.
But, beyond that, if at some point in an
actual enforcement action it was determined that Federal
law did have that impact, they would still have that
defense available to them. They would just have to, you
know, prove it up in a different way other than use the
form.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't answer my
point. Doesn't it frustrate Federal law when the
Federal law says that I-9 can be used for no purpose
other than the Federal adjudication of the status of
employees? I think that's --
MS. O'GRADY: Here -- here's what the law
says: It may not be used for purposes other than for
enforcement of this chapter. And we believe that
a State enforcement action, under the authority for
preserving sanctions through licensing and similar laws,
would fall within that. So we think they should be able
to use that; the employer should be able to use that.
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there -- isn't there a
difference between saying it may not be used for any
purpose other than for enforcement of this chapter and
other provisions of Federal law, on the one hand, and
saying, on the other hand, it may not be used for any
purpose other than in a Federal proceeding? The
enforcement -- the I-9 certainly could be used in a
Federal proceeding by the employer. Would that then --
would that be used for the enforcement of the Federal
law? I wouldn't think so.
MS. O'GRADY: That's true, Your Honor.
That's -- that --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is the I-9 -- I do have a
question on the I-9. I'm not certain. I thought under
Federal law that if the employee -- the employer isn't
certain, but the employee says here's my Social Security
card, here's the driver's license. The employer looks
at that, he's home free; is that right?
But under Federal -- under your law, under
Arizona law, he's not home free, and, moreover --
because he -- it may -- he's not home free. He still
could be prosecuted. Is that right or not?
MS. O'GRADY: No, that's not right, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: So if he shows the driver's
license -- under -- under Arizona law, if the -- if he
shows a driver's license and Social Security card, the
worker, the employer looks at it, the employer cannot be
prosecuted?
MS. O'GRADY: Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes or no?
MS. O'GRADY: We would need the evidence
that the person knowingly employed the unauthorized
alien and a good-faith defense through use of a --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- I thought
in reading it that it creates some kind of presumption,
but he is not home free?
MS. O'GRADY: No, Your Honor. The -- the
substantive --
JUSTICE BREYER: But under Federal law he is
home free.
MS. O'GRADY: The substantive requirements
under Arizona law and Federal law are the same. We're
imposing no new obligations. And --
JUSTICE BREYER: So then he's home free?
Look, I don't -- I'm trying to understand. Maybe it's
not enough time to explain it, but I thought Federal law
requires this E-9 business or whatever that E review is.
And I was worried about the E review which it seemed to
require because it seemed to me in 20 percent of the
cases where the notice is this guy is not authorized; we
don't have any record that he's authorized to work -- 20
percent of those are wrong, and he is authorized to
work.
So the employer who follows that is really
going to fire 20 percent of the people who will be
absolutely entitled to work. And so I'd just like you
to address those points, as you wish.
MS. O'GRADY: Okay. And let me walk through
how our law works to see if this addresses the concern.
So the -- Arizona doesn't change anything in terms of
the use of the I-9. We retain the same defense that's
in the Federal law for good-faith compliance with the
I-9. We do require employers to use E-Verify, although
we don't impose a sanction on that employer if they
don't use E-Verify.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain that,
E-Verify, because this is a Federal resource, and the
Federal Government has said we want this to be
voluntary. How can Arizona take a Federal resource,
which the Federal Government says is voluntary except in
certain circumstances, and turn it into something that's
mandatory?
MS. O'GRADY: We think the -- that question
is answered by looking at -- into the conflict
pre-emption analysis, because Congress didn't address
the role of the States with regard to E-Verify. And we
aren't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't -- I don't get
into any pre-emption or not, but it's -- Arizona wants
to use a Federal resource. And the Fed makes it
available if the employer can use it voluntarily, but
not mandatorily. How can -- how can Arizona set the
rules on the use of a Federal resource?
MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, we can -- as long
as it's not a burden to the objectives of Congress, we
think that we can require employers within our
jurisdiction to use E-Verify.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do you make it
mandatory?
MS. O'GRADY: Well, our statute says you
shall use E-Verify. We don't impose a penalty against
employers who fail to use it. The consequences are the
same as they are under Federal law.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You just -- you just don't
get the safe harbor. Isn't that the only consequence?
MS. O'GRADY: That's right. You don't get
the safe harbor under E-Verify. Now -- for the use of
E-Verify. We did add after this lawsuit was filed some
additional requirements similar to what they have under
the Federal system, where you can't get State contracts,
you can't get State grants.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you are taking the
mechanism that Congress said will be a pilot program
that is optional, and you are making it mandatory. It
seems to me that's almost a classic example of a State
doing something that is inconsistent with the Federal
requirement.
MS. O'GRADY: Well, again, we look at the
test for conflict pre-emption in terms of, does this
make it impossible to comply with Federal law? No, it's
really a question of are we interfering with
Congress's -- excuse me -- the Federal Government's
ability to achieve its goals? And the goal in
developing E-Verify is to have a more effective
verification system.
JUSTICE BREYER: If they fail to do it, then
they cannot receive any, quote, "grant, loan, or
performance-based incentive," end quote, from the State.
That's what the law says, isn't it?
MS. O'GRADY: That's what -- and that was
added after this lawsuit was filed.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I would think
then the answer to Justice Scalia's question is, yes,
there is that penalty. It isn't simply hortatory.
MS. O'GRADY: Well, there's no penalty in
terms of --
JUSTICE BREYER: You don't go to jail.
MS. O'GRADY: -- you get fined --
JUSTICE BREYER: What you do is you lose any
grant, loan, or performance-based incentive. Is that
right?
MS. O'GRADY: That's true under current law.
That's not what the plaintiffs challenged --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Does this lawsuit challenge
that?
MS. O'GRADY: That -- it does not, Your
Honor. They just challenged subsection (A) --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're under the old law,
and the only -- the only sanction is you lose the safe
harbor, if that's a sanction.
MS. O'GRADY: That's right. That's right,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, in answer to
Justice Breyer's earlier question, in fact, relying on
the I-9 does not provide a safe harbor, because under
the E-Verify system, you can't just rely on the I-9
forms and statutes; you have to rely on the E-Verify.
MS. O'GRADY: Well, Your Honor, we have the
same -- it's modeled after the Federal law. So, just as
Federal law has a defense for employers who in good
faith follow I-9, so does the State law. I --
JUSTICE ALITO: The Federal law and the
State law do seem to be exactly the same on this point,
but I have -- I don't understand how these two
provisions fit together when E-Verify is used.
Suppose an employer -- the first thing the
employer does is receive the forms from the employee,
from the I-9 process. He looks at the forms. Well,
they reasonably seem to be authentic. So that employer
now has the good-faith defense that's provided under --
by the I-9 process, under both Federal law and State
law.
But, under both Federal law and State law,
the employee -- employer either must or may also use the
e-verification system. The employer gets back a notice
of non-authorization. But what -- and that creates,
supposedly, a rebuttable presumption under both systems
that the employee is not authorized to work.
How does that fit together? If you have a
complete defense for having used the I-9 process in good
faith, the whole e-verification process seems to be
irrelevant under both Federal law and State law. I
don't understand how they fit together.
MS. O'GRADY: And, Justice Alito, we haven't
wrestled that in practical application, and I'm not
aware of them reaching that point under the Federal
system, either, but -- because it does seem at some
point, if you -- that the system should work, that if
you have used I-9 and you get back a final
non-confirmation, not a tentative non-confirmation, that
that employee is unauthorized, that that, you know,
seems like it should carry greater weight in an
enforcement action. But as a -- as an -- on an
as-applied basis, I'm not sure how that plays out in an
actual enforcement action.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you -- I
wasn't quite sure what she meant. Judge Schroeder, in
her opinion for the court, emphasized that this statute
was being evaluated on its -- on its face and that --
she said in as-applied, particular challenges might
arise.
How would that work? If we determine this
is not pre-empted, how would -- on its face, how would
an as-applied challenge come about?
MS. O'GRADY: I think, Your Honor, perhaps
if we -- perhaps in terms of what are the outer limits
of our definition of "license" and their saying that we
are outside the definition of licensing and similar laws
in a particular case, perhaps that would be an
as-applied-type challenge.
I think some of the I-9 concerns are perhaps
more appropriately resolved in a -- in a direct case
where that issue has arisen on an as-applied basis, and
I think she was concerned about some of the real
implementation questions that were wrapped into the
legal challenge.
But, for the most part, I think the general
framework of our statute is appropriate for -- in this
challenge.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you think after this
case we could look forward to cases, one by one, for all
the various types of licenses? Those would be
as-applied challenges and would not have been resolved
by this case.
MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, my hope is that
we've got --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We're really wasting our
time here, aren't we?
MS. O'GRADY: My hope is, Your Honor, that
we get sufficient guidance --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wouldn't -- wouldn't it
be easier, if that's Justice Scalia's concern, to take
the Solicitor General's position, that if you're
adjudicating good faith or intent differently in any way
from the Federal Government, that it's pre-empted?
Isn't that what waiting for an as-applied challenge
means, whether or not you are putting different
requirements on proving good faith?
MS. O'GRADY: No, Your Honor, and -- because
I was trying to give some examples of the kinds of
things that may come up as a practical matter, but I
think we can get the guidance from this Court. I hope
that we can proceed in implementation, but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, let -- then let me
ask the question directly. If Arizona's system does not
permit a employer to rely on non-suspect documents, the
I-9 documents that are permitted employers to rely on --
the Arizona system says, no, you can't rely on those.
Is that pre-empted or not?
You can't rely on I-9, or the Arizona system
says -- on the I-9 documents. Or the Arizona system
says you can't hire someone who hasn't been approved
under the e-verification system. Is that pre-empted?
MS. O'GRADY: I think those would both be
problems. I think we need to be consistent with the --
the structure and the obligations that are imposed under
Federal law in terms of our sanctions provisions.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So, are you -- are you
conceding that any variation from the Federal standards
for -- for criminal and civil liability is automatically
precluded?
I mean, as I read the exception, it's an
exception for State licensing and similar laws. And it
doesn't say "so long as those licensing and similar laws
go no further than what the Federal Government has
done." I mean, we often allow States to impose
regulatory requirements that go beyond the regulatory
requirements that the Federal Government has imposed,
and that is not automatically considered to be
pre-empted. So why -- why are you conceding that
Arizona cannot go a whit beyond what the Federal
Government says?
MS. O'GRADY: Because I think what Congress
preserved for us was our ability to impose sanctions,
including the suspension and revocation of State laws.
But I do think they established a uniform national
standard. I don't think we could, for example,
establish a -- a strict liability offense in Arizona.
We'd have to have a scienter requirement as they have in
Federal law.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what I was trying to
get is -- what I was looking at specifically is Federal
law says, if you look at the driver's license and Social
Security card -- those are I-9 docs -- then the employer
has established an affirmative defense and has not
violated the law. That's what it says. You know the
cite -- 27a or whatever. Okay? That's the Federal law.
Arizona law that I was reading -- maybe
there's another place I should read -- is it says, on
determining whether he's an unauthorized alien, the
court -- the court shall consider the Federal
Government's determination. It creates a rebuttable
presumption. That means it might be rebutted. Okay?
So I see a difference there. And the reason
that that's relevant is because, my first question, if
you are an employer, prior to your law, it's 50/50.
better verify because if I'm discriminating, you know,
da, da, da. And it's not that hard. I just look at the
driver's license and I look at -- I'm home free, and the
Social Security card, and if I hire an illegal
immigrant, the same thing, da, da, da. Okay? So same
both ways.
Your law: Employer, look at the driver's
license and Social Security, you are not home free.
Employer, if it turns out that you've been hiring this
illegal immigrant and he's not an American, your
business is finished. But what happens if I
discriminate? Under our law? Nothing.
Now, that was the original point they made.
That's why I brought up this question of difference in
standards. And I want to be absolutely clear what your
answer to that is.
MS. O'GRADY: And I'm hoping I am being
clear, Justice Breyer. We have the same standards as
Federal law. We have the same I-9 defense that's in
Federal law.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, where? Where is it
in the statute, then? Because what I read were the
words "rebuttable presumption," and I might be reading
the wrong words.
MS. O'GRADY: Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER: So tell me where it is.
MS. O'GRADY: Okay. Let me get to it, and
let me explain our rebuttable presumption while I find
the specific statutory cite for our I-9 process.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, it's on page 184 to
5 of the appendix to the petition, isn't it?
MS. O'GRADY: Yes. And 178a is the
provision: For the purposes of this section, employer
that establishes it has complied in good faith with the
requirements of 8 U.S.C. 1324a(b) establishes an
affirmative defense, et cetera. So that's the provision
that provides the I-9 defense.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the --
MS. O'GRADY: The rebuttable presumption
issue -- and this is how that comes into play. We have
to, in bringing an enforcement action, have to rely --
the State, in making its case, has to rely on
information from the Federal Government regarding
whether someone is authorized or unauthorized. We have
to rely on that information from the Federal Government.
We bring our action in State court if we have
verification from the Federal Government that that
person is unauthorized. We have additional information
that we've established the scienter requirement, then we
bring our action. But the employer has an opportunity
to rebut the evidence that we've presented in a State
court proceeding. It may be, you know, that person
doesn't work for us or some other type of evidence. So
that's the role of that rebuttable presumption, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, thank you. I see
that.
MS. O'GRADY: Certainly. So in terms of the
prior adjudication --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just so you know, I
interpret your answer as confirming the implication of
Justice Breyer's question, that there is a very
substantial difference in Federal and State law on this
point. I mean, you've told about -- you know what
lawsuits are about. If you're -- if you're home free by
a driver's license and Social Security inspection under
Federal law and you're not under State law, that is a
difference --
MS. O'GRADY: And our standards are the
same. And it's subsection (J) in which we have the I-9
affirmative defense in our State law and our Federal --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think you are
home free under State law?
MS. O'GRADY: To the extent that you would
-- should be home free and you'd have the benefit of
that good-faith defense.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an affirmative
defense under both.
MS. O'GRADY: Yes, Your Honor. But having
the --
JUSTICE BREYER: The main point -- I mean,
I'll check that. I think maybe I was mistaken, perhaps,
in that I was looking at the other section.
MS. O'GRADY: That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER: But then we're still stuck
with this enormous discrepancy in penalty. I mean, I'm
characterizing it as enormous, but it seems like the --
you know, it's even on discrimination versus under the
Federal law. It's not even -- your business is out to
lunch, gone, and on the other side it has nothing. What
about that one?
MS. O'GRADY: I think, Your Honor, that that
is the natural consequence of the savings clause that
Congress itself adopted.
JUSTICE BREYER: The savings clause itself,
the word "licensing" -- not everyone looks at this, but
I did look at the legislative history. And when you
look at that paragraph on page 39 of the red brief, it
seems to me that that paragraph says what it means. It
says precisely what it is. It says -- the first thing
it says is that, look, if you're found to have violated
this -- where is it? It's page -- there it is.
Suppose somebody has been found to have
violated the sanctions provision in the Federal
legislation. Now, you've found -- he has been found by
the Federal Government. Then what the State does, it
can revoke his license. Okay? That's one thing. And
the second thing it says it wants -- doesn't want to
pre-empt "'fitness to do business laws,' such as State
farm labor contracting laws or forestry laws." In other
words, it's thinking of some precise set of licenses,
and that's why this licensing thing was there. And the
very next part of this Federal law are conforming
amendments, and those conforming amendments apply to
departments of government that were concerned with
maintaining State farm labor contractor laws.
Now, I grant you, you have to go beyond the
text, but some of us do because we get enlightenment.
And going beyond that text, it seems to me we should
follow what that House report says. Now, what is your
response to that?
MS. O'GRADY: Well, first, of course, we
would focus on the text where Congress could have but
did not --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I've got --
MS. O'GRADY: -- limit -- they didn't limit
JUSTICE BREYER: I said yes, I've got broad
licensing -- but let's deal with the part where you look
at their explanation as to why they put those words
there.
MS. O'GRADY: Okay. First, the farm labor
contractor is simply an example, and I think it says
"such as" an example of the type of licensing provisions
that existed at this time that addressed that. So
that's not an all-inclusive universe of sanctions that
-- of -- of all the licensing laws that might be subject
to this. They also don't specifically say there has to
be a prior Federal adjudication. That sentence has
passive voice, "has been determined," without specifying
who is making that determination, and it specifically
refers to State and local processes that provide for the
suspension and revocation of State licenses.
And then the sentence goes -- then there's a
following sentence that says, you know, further, we
don't intend to disrupt laws such as these forestry and
other, you know, fitness to do business.
We think this is a fitness to do business
law in that we are establishing as a State standard that
if you engage in this conduct of knowingly employing
unauthorized aliens, we are going to have the ability to
take an action against that license that we have given
you to do business in our jurisdiction. So we think we
fit within that last sentence of the -- of the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you also explain the
I-9? You said it's the same as in the Fed. Home free
if you have documents, Social Security, driver's
license. But you also require the E-Verify. So how --
does the E-Verify information modify the I-9? How --
how do those two --
MS. O'GRADY: They work in our system, Your
Honor, as they do under the Federal law, under -- that
you get a rebuttable presumption if you -- in your favor
if you've used E-Verify, but the affirmative defense if
you've used I-9. And I am -- there is that caution; it
is good-faith use of -- of the I-9 system. We do have
examples where, for example, if an employer is
terminated because they are unauthorized and they show
up with a different name and different papers 2 weeks
later, you're not going to be able to establish your
good faith. So you're home free but subject to that
good-faith limitation. But we do incorporate the same
obligations that exist under Federal law.
And also I wanted to address more on the
farm labor contractors and the amendments. And what we
think that they were doing in those amendments was
simply dividing responsibility at the Federal level
between the Department of Labor and their processes that
pre-existed IRCA, and what they were establishing in
IRCA, and said we're not going to have these
determinations of whether they -- the farm labor
contractor has employed an unauthorized alien through a
Department of Labor process; we're going to instead use
the IRCA-established process.
But, importantly, what Congress did not
change in the agricultural worker regulations was the
provision that addresses State law. It said, before
IRCA and after IRCA, that those laws -- those Federal
laws only supplement the authority of the States and
that means that they preserved all of the State
authority that they had before IRCA in the area of farm
labor contractors. And that I think is reinforced by
the legislative history that -- that again reinforces
that those have been preserved through IRCA.
This is an area that has traditionally been
within the mainstream of State police power. We
acknowledge that Congress does have the authority to
pre-empt us, but they left important discretion in terms
of our ability to impose sanctions through licensing and
similar laws, and we are doing so by establishing this
scheme that provides for the suspension and revocation
of State licenses.
It's an important part of the balance that
Congress struck when it enacted IRCA by addressing what
State authority would exist after that congressional
enactment. We think the lower courts properly
determined the scope of that provision.
And unless there are further questions, I
thank you for your attention this morning.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and, once again, may it please the Court:
I want to begin frankly where Justice
Sotomayor pointed me to before, which is the question of
whether or not there really is a basis for allowing the
States to independently investigate and to independently
adjudicate these matters. And what is the evidence that
Congress did not intend that?
Justice Breyer quoted from the House report,
recognizing not everybody accepts that, but it does seem
to me to articulate a very commonsense limitation that
says you have to have a Federal adjudication in the
first instance, and once you've got that, then the State
is allowed to add that sanction.
That -- that principle, it seems to me, is
reinforced by the limitation on what you can use the I-9
for. Justice Alito, you asked that question, but it
does seem to me quite clear that what Congress
envisioned in 1986 when it adopted this is you're going
to have an exclusively Federal enforcement scheme
including the adjudicatory process, and it is only in
that context that you are allowed to use the I-9. And
the notion that the State could adopt a standard of
intentional or knowingly, and not be able to have the
I-9 materials available, seems to me flatly at odds with
each other, and, therefore, it cannot be that Congress
intended under those circumstances to allow these
matters to be adjudicated in that particular fashion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What can -- Mr. Phillips,
what can the State do that would be complementary rather
than conflicting?
MR. PHILLIPS: I -- it seems to me the
easiest -- and of course, this has nothing to do with
what Arizona does -- but the easiest is, if a -- an
employer is convicted of -- of violating IRCA and a
criminal sanction, and he happens to be a barber, and
the State licensing law says if you're convicted of a --
of a Federal crime you will lose your license, it is
available to the State under those circumstances -- and
I think this is exactly what Congress had in mind -- to
issue a notice to show cause why that particular person
shouldn't have the license revoked and then go from
there.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Convicted by -- by a
Federal Government that hasn't gone after many
convictions.
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the whole problem.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. But,
Justice Scalia, it seems to me the whole question here
-- and first of all, I don't think pre-emption can be a
moving target. I think you have to decide it on a basis
of what Congress had in front of it in 1986. But
remember, Congress was balancing three, at least, very
difficult problems: minimizing burdens on the
employers, minimizing discrimination against people who
are permitted to be hired, and avoiding hiring people
who are not permitted to do so.
And how you properly reconcile that is very
difficult, but the one thing that seems to me clear is
that that was a choice Congress meant to leave to itself
and to the Federal Government to sort out and not to
give the States the opportunity to come in where they
did.
And to say one last word about E-Verify --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except --
well, you're just kind of blinking over the savings
clause: except through licensing and similar laws. So
that's not a real reservation by Congress of this power
to itself.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you -- if you
interpret the savings clause as I do, which means truly
as a supplement to Federal -- Federal adjudication, then
it is a very narrow limitation on that basis, because at
that point you've already invoked the entirety of the
Federal scheme, and it doesn't modify the balance on
those broader legal issues, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
