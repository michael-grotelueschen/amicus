CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services v.
Hobby Lobby Stores; and 13-356, Conestoga Wood
Specialties Corporation v. Sebelius.
Mr. Clement.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PARTIES
MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
When a Federal Government agency compelled
employers to provide something as religiously sensitive
as contraception, it knew that free exercise in RFRA
claims would soon follow.
In particular, the agency itself provided
exemptions and accommodations for the religious exercise
of a subset --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is your claim limited to
sensitive materials like contraceptives or does it
include items like blood transfusion, vaccines?  For
some religions, products made of pork?  Is any claim
under your theory that has a religious basis, could an
employer preclude the use of those items as well?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, the
first step in the analysis would be to ask whether or
not there's a substantial burden on religious exercise.
I do think this case is, in a sense, easier than most of
the examples that you've brought up because here's one
where it's so religiously sensitive, so fraught with
religious controversy, that the agency itself provides a
certain number of exemptions and accommodations.  So
that's one way, I think, that you'd address the first
step of the question here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I mean, just take one
of the things that Justice Sotomayor asked about, which
is vaccinations, because there are many people who have
religious objections to vaccinations.  So suppose an
employer does and -- and refuses to fund or wants not to
fund vaccinations for her employees, what -- what
happens then?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, if we assume we get past
the substantial burden step of the analysis, then the
next step of the analysis is the compelling interest and
least restrictive alternatives analysis.  And every case
would have to be analyzed on its own.  I do think in the
context of vaccinations, the government may have a
stronger compelling interest than it does in this
context because there are notions of herd immunity and
the like that give the government a particularly
compelling interest in trying to maximize the number --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Blood transfusions?
MR. CLEMENT:  Blood transfusions.  Again,
each one of these cases, I think would have to be
evaluated on its own and apply the compelling
interest-least restrictive alternative test and the
substantial burdens part of the test.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So really, every medical
treatment.  And Justice Sotomayor is quite right that
there are quite a number of medical treatments that
difference religious groups object to.  So one religious
group could opt out of this and another religious group
could opt out of that and everything would be piecemeal
and nothing would be uniform.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well -- well, Justice Kagan,
nothing could be clearer than when Congress passed RFRA
Congress made a judgment that RFRA was going to apply to
all manner of Federal statutes.  And I think what the
Congress --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Clement, maybe it
seemed clear then, but since RFRA, just as before RFRA,
Congress has continued to write into Federal legislation
specific religious exemptions for some, but not
everybody, for individuals, sometimes religious
institutions.  So if it was all that clear that RFRA
took care of it all, why did Congress continue after
RFRA to pass these laws focusing the exemption on an
individual, religious institution?  Those, as I take
your argument, all of those laws -- and there are more
than half a dozen -- were unnecessary.  Once RFRA was on
the books, Congress didn't have to do that any more.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'm
not sure that they were all unnecessary.  And of course,
in a variety of contexts, Congress may proceed on a belt
and suspenders matters.  So I think there's really two
different questions.  One is when Congress passed RFRA,
was RFRA just done with creating other exemptions.  And
I think the answer to that is no.  But I think the
question that Justice Kagan's question brought up is,
was Congress evident and did Congress specifically
consider whether RFRA would apply across the board to
all the provisions of 18 U.S.C., or rather all the
provisions of the United States Code.  And Congress
could not have been clearer that it was passing a
statute that it wanted to apply to all preexisting
statutes and to all subsequent statutes unless Congress
specifically provided otherwise.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You were beginning by
giving us a framework for your argument.  Do I think of
this as a statutory case?  Of course, the First
Amendment is on the stage at some point here, but I take
it you can prevail just on the question of statutory
interpretation, and if that is so, are there any
statutory rules that work in your favor, that is to say,
avoiding a constitutional question or how do we think
about this case, primarily as a statutory case?
MR. CLEMENT:  Obviously, one of my clients
has before you right now a free exercise claim and my
other client has a free exercise claim that's live in
the lower courts.  So those issues are preserved.  But
I, think, as your question points out, this Court
really, first and foremost, can decide this on the basis
of the Federal statute, and the Ashwander principles of
constitutional avoidance seem like they would be sort of
fully applicable to the Court's consideration of that
question.  And then, of course, the normal principles of
statutory construction would certainly point you to the
answer to the first objection the government raises,
which is do persons include for-profit corporations
because --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement, isn't this a
special kind of statute?  Because this is a statute that
specifically refers back to a body of constitutional
law.  It basically says we want to get right back to the
place that we were with respect to religious claims
before Employment Division v. Smith.  And so we have --
it's not -- you know, it's a statute that directs us to
a body of constitutional law.
That body of constitutional law is, I think,
very different from the one you portray in your brief.
It suggests that accommodations should be made
sometimes, but rarely, and subject to a -- to a
balancing analysis, not to a compelling interest
standard in the way we would use it for, say, race
discrimination.  So, you know, what's -- what's the
response to that?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, first, Justice Kagan,
let me take a little bit of an issue with your premise
and let me try to responsive to your question anyways
after I do that.  How I'd like to take issue with your
premise is that when Congress first passed the statute
RFRA, it talked about free exercise as defined in the
Court's cases.  And then at the time that it passed
RLUIPA, which is a later statute, it actually confronted
some lower court cases that had limited RFRA and tried
to impose a centrality requirement.  And Congress didn't
want that.  It didn't want to take all the baggage of
the pre-Smith free exercise cases.  So it actually
amended the statute to broaden it so it now protects any
exercise of religion.  So I would take issue with your
premise that RFRA simply picks up everything that ever
happened pre-Smith.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, there -- there's
another respect in which this, even as originally
enacted, does not track the -- the preemployment
Division v. Smith law.  That is to say, the -- the
compelling State interest test in the prior cases was
never accompanied by a least restrictive alternative
requirement.  That was an invention of this -- of this
law.
MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's fair, Justice
Scalia.  One of the things that you run into if you try
to sort of get at this statute the way that Justice
Kagan is suggesting is that not everybody exactly agreed
as to what the pre-Smith case law was.  You described
the pre-Smith case law in your opinion in a certain way.
Justice O'Connor described the pre-Smith case law in
another way.  So it's a little bit difficult to try to
say, as Justice Kagan's question would suggest, that
rather than just apply the statute as written, we should
really sort of just go back and apply pre-Smith laws if
this were --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it is applying the
statute as written.  The statute as written -- this is
not a question of legislative history -- the statute as
written points back to pre-Smith law.  It says:  That's
what we mean.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, you're right, Justice
Kagan, in the purpose part of the statute it says:  What
we mean to do here is basically restore the pre-Smith
law.  But it also accompanies that purpose statute with
operative language.  And the operative language, which I
think this Court should apply, as Justice Scalia
suggests, applies broadly to any exercise of religion by
any person and then suggests that the relevant test is
substantial burden with the burden on my client as to
the substantial burden part of the test.  And then
it's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Clement, this -- this
was a law that was passed overwhelmingly, both houses of
Congress.  People from all sides of the political
spectrum voted for it.  It seems strange that there
would have been that tremendous uniformity if it means
what you said it means, to take -- to cover profit
corporations, especially in light of -- there was an
effort to adopt a conscience amendment, a specific
conscience amendment in 2012, and the Senate rejected
that.  That -- that amendment would have enabled secular
employers and insurance providers to deny coverage on
the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions.  It
was specifically geared to secular employers and
insurance providers.  And that -- that was rejected.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I
would suggest to the contrary.  The reason that there
was such unanimity behind RFRA in the first place is
that efforts to limit it to just certain subclasses,
subsets of religious freedom claims, were rejected and
sort of everybody in Congress got together and said, all
right, you have some claims you actually want to be
vindicated, you have some claims you want to be
vindicated, we'll vindicate all of them.  And if we're
going to look at any legislative history as shedding
light on this, then I would suggest you look at
Professor Laycock's brief, which goes into great detail
about the legislative debates involved in -- that led up
ultimately to the passage of RLUIPA.  And when Congress
was trying to pass a broader statute, the RLPA, the
Religious Liberty Protection Act, the issue of the
statute's application and RFRA's application to
for-profit corporations was squarely put at issue by the
Nadler Amendment.  And that amendment was rejected and
the House report that demonstrates the rejection of that
amendment could not be clearer that they understood that
for-profit corporations would be covered.
Now, in fairness, what they understood is
that we were probably talking about in the real world a
relatively small set of corporations like an
incorporated kosher market or kosher deli of the kind
that this Court had before it in the Crown Kosher case.
And so I think it's -- you know, we can talk about the
extent and how you'd apply these principles to Exxon,
but I think that's just something that's not going to
happen in the real world.  It is no accident that the
claims that you have before you in these cases are
brought by small closely-held corporations that have
firmly held religious beliefs.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, again, Mr. Clement as
Justice Ginsburg said, this was a very uncontroversial
law.  Your understanding of this law, your
interpretation of it, would essentially subject the
entire U.S. Code to the highest test in constitutional
law, to a compelling interest standard.  So another
employer comes in and that employer says, I have a
religious objection to sex discrimination laws; and then
another employer comes in, I have a religious objection
to minimum wage laws; and then another, family leave;
and then another, child labor laws.  And all of that is
subject to the exact same test which you say is this
unbelievably high test, the compelling interest standard
with the least restrictive alternative.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I don't say that.  I
think Congress said that.  But to be as responsive as I
can to your question, the parade of horribles that the
government offers you ought to sound familiar, because
if you look at that parade of horribles -- Social
Security, minimum wage, discrimination laws, compelled
vaccination -- every item on that list was included in
Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court in Smith.  And
Justice O'Connor responded to that in her separate
opinion and she said, look, you've got to trust the
courts; just because free exercise claims are being
brought doesn't mean that the courts can't separate the
sheep from the goats.  Now, whatever --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, she had an
understanding of how the Court worked pre-Smith that was
a kind of Sherbert v. Verner-Yoder understanding, which
was we did a balancing, we looked at the government's
interests, we took those very seriously, especially to
the extent that there was harm to identifiable third
parties and that it fell on an identifiable third party.
That was basically -- you could not get an accommodation
for that kind of harm.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, what she said and
whatever the merits of it as a matter of constitutional
debate isn't relevant.  What -- what I think is relevant
is that Congress clearly preferred one side of that
debate and thought courts could handle this.
So then the question becomes:  How do courts
actually apply this test?  And I don't think applying
the test to recognize this case, where I think the
government has an incredibly weak case on compelling
interest and least restrictive alternatives, which they
almost don't want to talk about at all, is going to
endanger any other statutes.  And if I could talk about
specific --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, could I ask you this,
Mr. Clement.  In -- in all the years since RFRA has been
on the books, has any of these claims involving minimum
wage, for example, been brought and have they succeeded?
MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Alito, very few of
these claims have been brought.  Very few of them have
succeeded, and that's notwithstanding the fact that all
of these statutes we're talking about apply to employers
generally.  And it -- and none of those claims have been
brought or they haven't succeeded notwithstanding the
fact that the government concedes that sole
proprietorships and partnerships and nonprofit
corporations are all protected by RFRA.
Now, millions of Americans are employed by
proprietorships, partnerships, and nonprofits.  So if
these statutes really were on a collision course, I
think we would have seen the collision already.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, with respect,
Mr. Clement, I think that that's probably because the
Court has had a different understanding of what RFRA
does and the kind of analysis that it requires courts to
perform than you're arguing for in this case.  That if
your argument were adopted and there was a strict
scrutiny standard of the kind that usually applies and a
least restrictive alternative requirement, then you
would see religious objectors come out of the woodwork
with respect to all of these laws.  And because you say
that there -- and I think this is absolutely right when
you say it -- that you -- you cannot test the centrality
of a belief to a religion, you cannot test the sincerity
of religion.  I think a court would be, you know --
their hands would be bound when faced with all these
challenges if your standard applies.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, a couple
of thoughts.  First of all, I mean, it's not like this
Court has never had a RFRA case that it applied the
standard on the merits.  And in the O Centro case, this
Court applied something that very much felt to the
government at the time as being strict scrutiny.  But if
this Court --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, It was a religious
organization.
MR. CLEMENT:  It certainly was a religious
organization and it's a separate question as --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is -- this is what's
different.  I mean, all along the earlier cases dealt
with individuals and they dealt with religious
institutions.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, if I may, Justice
Ginsburg, there's two separate questions.  There's a
question about how to apply the test if it's applicable
in a particular case, and I think O Centro is the
starting place for guidance on that.
Your question also brings up the separate
question about the coverage of the statute.  And as to
that, I think the place to start is the statute itself,
which broadly provides coverages to persons.  That is
not an incidental term.  It's a term that picks up
additional context through the Dictionary Act and
specifically applies to all corporations, to joint
partnerships, to societies.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How does a corporation
exercise religion?  I mean, I know how it speaks and we
have, according to our jurisprudence, 200 years of
corporations speaking in its own interests.  But where
are the cases that show that a corporation exercises
religion?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Sotomayor,
those -- those cases -- I mean, I'd start with cases
like Lukumi or O Centro, which all involved
corporations, and nobody thought it was particularly
problematic there that the plaintiffs before the court
were artificial entities.  And I suppose you could
take --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but they were
really arguing about things that affected their
membership, not them as a corporate entity.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I'm not sure that you
can so easily divide the two, and we can talk about how
it is with corporations generally.  You understand how
the corporation has certain beliefs or certain intent, a
scienter requirement.  The courts every day deal with
issues of trying to figure out what kind of intent or
motivation a corporate entity has.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the dissent in this
case, in the Tenth Circuit case, said how do we
determine when a corporation has that belief?  Who says
it?  The majority of shareholders?  The corporate
officers?  The -- is it 51 percent?  What happens to the
minority?  And how much of the business has to be
dedicated to religion?  5 percent?  10 percent?  90
percent?  Just assume not a business like yours -- you
picked great plaintiffs, but let's assume --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's assume just a
business that sells 5 percent of religious books,
doesn't play Christmas music, doesn't give off -- works
on Sunday, you know, does nothing else religiously.
MR. CLEMENT:  Right.  And, Justice
Sotomayor, I think the way to approach those cases would
be the same basic way you approach other questions of
corporate intent or corporate motivation.  You look to
the governance doctrines, if any of this is put at
issue.  And I think that's really a critical question,
which is ultimately, I think this line of questioning
goes to a question of sincerity, and if some large
corporation asserts some claim that's going to save them
lots of money, I would think that the government in
those kind of cases is really going to resist the
sincerity piece of the analysis.  In this kind of
case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the most
dangerous piece.  That's the one we've resisted in all
our exercise jurisprudence, to measure the depth of
someone's religious beliefs.
MR. CLEMENT:  To be clear, this Court's
cases have always distinguished between the sincerity
inquiry, which the Court has allowed, and the centrality
inquiry, which it suggested is inappropriate.  But
sincerity has always been a part of this Court's cases.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought more
importantly was whether a burden was substantial or not.
That we've never acceded to the person claiming a
religious exemption, a belief in how substantial the
burden might be.
MR. CLEMENT:  Right.  This Court has not
questioned that.  The Thomas case, I think, puts as
common ground the idea that you don't really
second-guess the person's -- the person's belief, but
you can contest sincerity.  It is -- there is case law
in this.  You know, you have people who are arrested in
possession of large quantities of marijuana and they
assert that they belong to the church of marijuana, and
those cases do get litigated and they get rejected.  And
there's a lot of different ways to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there -- is there a
different way of looking at it, the leeway?  In U.S. v.
Lee, we said, "When followers of a particular sect enter
into a commercial activity as a matter of choice, the
limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of
conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the
statutory schemes which are binding on others in that
activity."
So isn't that really the answer, that we've
never considered a for-profit corporation as exercising
religion?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, let me -- let me take on
Lee first.  And I mean, that's obviously the two lines
of Lee that are the government's favorite two lines in
Lee.  But Lee starts with a substantial burden inquiry,
which is where most of these sincerity questions go.
And Lee definitely says that there is a sincere
religious belief and a substantial burden on religious
exercise.
So the two sentences that you're quoting
come in the compelling interest analysis of the case.
And I think Lee does stand for the proposition that in
the tax context, it's going to be very hard for somebody
to bring a claim that satisfies even the demanding
compelling interest, least restrictive alternative test.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's an
interesting question, because the briefs on both sides
here are written as if the penalty for not having a
health insurance policy that covers contraceptives is at
issue.  But isn't there another choice nobody talks
about, which is paying the tax, which is a lot less than
a penalty and a lot less than -- than the cost of health
insurance at all?  These employers could choose not to
give health insurance and pay not that high a penalty --
not that high a tax.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, just to put this in
concrete terms, for Hobby Lobby, for example, the choice
is between paying a 500 -- a $475 million per year
penalty and paying a $26 million per year coverage.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I don't think that
that's the same thing, Mr. Clement.  There's one penalty
that is if the employer continues to provide health
insurance without this part of the coverage, but Hobby
Lobby could choose not to provide health insurance at
all.  And in that case Hobby Lobby would pay $2,000 per
employee, which is less than Hobby Lobby probably pays
to provide insurance to its employees.
So there is a choice here.  It's not even a
penalty by -- in the language of the statute.  It's a
payment or a tax.  There's a choice.  And so the
question is, why is there a substantial burden at all?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, just to be clear, we
were talking about the same thing.  So the option, the
choice, is between paying a $475 million a year penalty
and a $26 million a year penalty.  That's what Hobby
Lobby faces.  So $2,000 per person --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, between paying $2,000
per employee per year if Hobby Lobby does not provide --
MR. CLEMENT:  That's $26 million.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, Hobby Lobby is
paying something right now for the -- for the coverage.
It's less than what Hobby Lobby is paying for the
coverage.  There are employers all over the United
States that are doing this voluntarily because they
think that it's less.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought -- I
thought that part of the religious commitment of the
owners was to provide health care for its employees.
MR. CLEMENT:  That is true, Mr. Chief
Justice.  It is also true that this --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, if they want to do
that, they can just pay a greater salary and let the
employees go in on the exchange.
MR. CLEMENT:  Exactly, which is, by the way,
why comparing the $2,000 penalty to the cost of the
health care is a false -- it's a false comparison.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not called a
penalty.  It's called a tax.  And it's calibrated -- and
it's calibrated --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  She's right about
that.
(Laughter.)
MR. CLEMENT:  And it has been treated for
some purposes as a penalty.  And I think for this
purposes, it certainly feels punitive.
And if I could finish the thought about why it's
a false comparison, the 2,000 penalty to the cost of the
health insurance, is that it's going to very much hurt
Hobby Lobby if all of the sudden it doesn't provide
health care to its employees.  And in order to
compensate for that, it would have to increase the
wages.  And I think it would be worse off as a result of
this.  But if I could also --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, let's say that that's
right.  Let's say that they have to increase the wages a
little bit.  I mean, still we are talking about pretty
equivalent numbers.  Maybe it's a little bit less; maybe
it's a little bit more.  But this is not the kind of
thing that's going to drive a person out of business.
It's not prohibitive.
It's like the thing that we talked about in
Braunfeld where we said, you know, maybe if the store
can't stay open 7 days a week, it makes a little bit
less money.  But so be it, is what we said.
MR. CLEMENT:  No, I actually think what it's
like, Your Honor, with all due respect, it's like the
five dollar penalty enforcing the prohibition in Yoder.
And what this Court says, it's one thing if you don't
have a direct government prohibition on a religious
exercise or a mandate that somebody do something that
violates their religion.  In those cases, which is like
Sherbert and is like Braunfeld, then you have to look at
the substantial pressure, and it becomes a little bit
more of a loosey-goosey analysis.  But when you have a
government law that specifically says you must do
something that violates your religion -- and it's
enforced with a penalty, and with all due respect I
think $2,000 per employee is a penalty.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Mr. Clement, it's not
saying you must do something that violates your
religion.  It's giving you a choice.  You can do this
thing or if this thing violates your religion you can do
another thing.  And that other thing is approximately
the same price as the thing that you don't want to do.
MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think it would be the
same price at the end of the day.  I'd also like to
point out how this --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, of course it wouldn't
be the same price at the end of the day.  If they deny
health insurance, they're going to have to raise wages
if they are going to get employees.
MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's absurd to say that,
you know, it comes out of nowhere.
MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  And
by the way, this $2,000 penalty is very much a
double-edged sword for the government, because you're
trying to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why -- why is that a
problem?  Let's assume that the cost of providing
insurance is roughly equivalent to the $2,000 penalty.
How -- how is the employer hurt?  He can just raise the
wages.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I just put a
footnote on this.  I thought the average price of
providing insurance for a single person is $4,000, and
it's $12,000 for a family -- for a family.  So the 2,000
tax -- that's what it's called -- is to help the
government provide subsidies to people on the exchange
that don't have employer insurance.  So it's a tax
because it's -- it is to do exactly what your client
wants, to get the government to supply the
contraceptives, not the insurance companies.
MR. CLEMENT:  Here's the problem with this
way of looking at it, which is to say whatever it costs
per employee to get this, this health care, that's
something that right now Hobby Lobby is paying whatever
it's paying them, plus it's -- it's -- you know, imputed
into that is the idea that they're getting their wage
and they're getting health care insurance.
If they take away the health care insurance,
they are going to have to increase the wages to make up
for that.  And they're going to have to pay the $2,000
penalty on top of it, plus they're going to have to
violate their -- their own interest which is, we
actually -- we believe it's important to provide our
employees with qualified health care.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay, the last is
important.  But just assume hypothetically that it's a
wash, that the employer would be in about the same
position if he paid the penalty and the employer --
pardon me, an employee went out and got the insurance
and that the employee's wages were raised slightly and
then it's -- and that it's a wash so far as the employer
are concerned, other than the employer's religious
objection, but just on the financial standpoint.  Can we
assume that as a hypothetical.  Then what would your
case be?
MR. CLEMENT:  I think my case would be that
in that case the government might be able to sort of
support itself on the compelling interest.  I think
there would still be a substantial burden on their
exercise.  But again, this all turns on issues that the
government hasn't put in issue.  This case hasn't been
litigated on this particular theory, so I think -- I'd
love to have the opportunity to show how by not
providing health insurance it would have a huge burden
on my client and their ability to attract workers, and
that in fact would cost them much more out of pocket.
But that's not been the nature of the government's
theory.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was a point made
earlier, and I think you didn't mean to say this, that
provision of health care is not part of their religious
belief.  Covering their employees for health care, that
is not a religious tenet, right?
MR. CLEMENT:  No, it actually is.  Again, it
hasn't been the principal theory on which this case has
been litigated.  But see, if you go back to the
complaints and you go back to our briefs, you know, it's
part of the religious beliefs that both the Hahns and
the Greens have.  They think it's actually important --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Clement, you're not
saying, are you, that their religious beliefs mandate
them to provide health care?  I thought that you were
never making that claim.
MR. CLEMENT:  I didn't have to make that
claim in the course of this litigation.  What I'm
pointing out, though, is for purposes of the substantial
burden analysis, it is perfectly appropriate to take
into account that the 2,000 -- the $26 million in fines
they would pay would not be the only thing that they
would lose out if they are on that horn of the dilemma.
They would also lose out all the additional wages they
would have to pay, and they would be in this position of
not offering health care, which is something they
believe is important for their religion as well.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, I'm sure they seem
like very good employers.  And I'm sure they want to be
good employers.  But again, that's a different thing
than saying that their religious beliefs mandate them to
provide health insurance, because here Congress has said
that the health insurance that they're providing is not
adequate, it's not the full package.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, with respect, what
Congress has said is that this kind of plan is not
appropriate for a non-grandfathered plan.  But if we're
going to talk about the government's compelling
interests here, which I think has got to be part of the
analysis, then I think the grandfathered provisions of
this statute really are devastating for the government's
argument that it has a compelling interest.
When the government pursues compelling
interest, it demands immediate compliance.  It doesn't
say, "Get around to it whenever it's convenient."  I
can't imagine Congress passing Title VII and saying,
"Stop discriminating on the basis of race, unless of
course you have a preexisting policy that discriminates
on the basis of race, and then you can keep it as long
as you'd like."
It is fundamentally inconsistent with a
compelling interest --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but I think even --
MR. CLEMENT:  -- analysis to have this kind
of grandfathering.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that example, you know,
initially Title VII did not apply to any employers with
fewer than 25 employees.  And then gradually, Congress
brought the number down because Congress realized that
there were going to be transition issues and that some
time was needed to make sure that the compelling
interest, you know, should be applied uniformly across
all employers.
MR. CLEMENT:  Here's, respectfully, why I
don't think that that works, which is I think the
question whenever there are exemptions in the statute is
to ask yourself, do the exemptions undermine the
compelling interest that the government asserts.
There's nothing inconsistent with an
interest in prohibiting employment discrimination to say
we're going to focus on the people who actually employ
the most people and therefore can engage in the most
discrimination.
It's quite a different matter, and I don't
think anybody would think that Congress would pass a
Title VII that said, "Hey, as long as you have a
preexisting discriminatory policy, you're allowed to
keep it."  That doesn't seem like it would be
consistent.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, your
attorney -- one of the attorneys below on behalf of your
clients admitted that the grandfathered policies weren't
going to be around very long because any change to an
existing policy -- and he said these changes happen on a
yearly basis.  And we already know from the government's
statistics that it's up to 40 percent now have
grandfathered out.  Your own client changed its policy,
and that's why it's not grandfathered.
And he changed it to drop contraceptives it
was covering.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so my point is,
since when does a transitioned grandfathered exemption
and one that everybody knows will have to change,
because premiums by definition will change or co-pays
will change, something is going to change -- it's a very
short transition period.  Since when does that prove
that the need is not compelling?
MR. CLEMENT:  With all due respect, it's not
necessarily a very short transition period.  And your --
your references to co-pays and premiums is precisely on
point, because the government, through its regulations,
has allowed grandfathered plans to make changes to the
co-pays as long as they're indexed to medical inflation.
Now, if you have a transition period that's
just there for a nanosecond, you don't bother indexing
it to medical inflation.  So this is a grandfather
provision that's going to be around for multiple years.
And by the government's own numbers, tens of millions of
employees are not getting this mandated coverage as a
result of the grandfather provision.  And even if we can
project forward ten years to when maybe there would only
be a handful of grandfathered plans, even at that point,
you would still have the same problem that the
government would have, which is it has to make an
argument for a compelling interest.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just before your time
starts to go too fast, how would you suggest that we
think about the position and the rights of the -- of the
employees?  And you can have hypotheticals about the
employer makes them -- wants to make them wear burkas
and so forth.  That's not in this case.
But in -- in a way, the employees are in a
position where the government, through its healthcare
plans, is -- is, under your view, is -- is allowing the
employer to put the employee in a disadvantageous
position.  The employee may not agree with these
religious -- religious beliefs of the employer.  Does
the religious beliefs just trump?  Is that the way it
works?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, no, it's not just the
way it works, Justice Kennedy.  And I actually have four
things I'd like to say about that, if it's possible.
One is, I think the first thing about
third-party burdens is you have to ask where are they
coming from.  And if the third-party burdens are coming
from an employer -- I mean, an employer right now can
put some burden on their rights because they have to
listen to religious music or whatever.  That's not as
serious as a burden that's coming directly from the
government.  So that's one principle to think about.
Another principle, and this is more of a
detail, but I think it's important, is that to the
extent you take into account third-party burdens, you
take those into account in the compelling interest part
of the analysis.  The government has an argument that
somehow third-party interests go into the substantial
burden part of the analysis, where we bear the burden.
And we don't think that's right at all.
The third-party --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, Mr. Clement, you
made the analogy to RLUIPA.  And the one thing that has
not been mentioned up till now is the Establishment
Clause.  The Court was very clear when it came to
RLUIPA, which you said is similar to RFRA, that the
accommodation must be measured so it doesn't override
other significant interests.  And that was true of
Sherbert and that was true of Yoder.  The -- and the
Cutter case, and this Court made it very clear, that the
accommodation has to be balanced and you have to take
into account other significant interests.
MR. CLEMENT:  Right.  But that actually
brings me to my third point, which is those other
significant interests that carry the most weight have to
be independent of the very statute that's at issue in
the case and that the party seeks an exemption from.
So if you think about the Caldor case, there
the Court was concerned with the third-party burdens on,
say, an employee who had a seniority right to take the
weekends off.  So he or she had an independent right to
take the weekend off, and the government policy was
coming in and displacing this.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure that --
that squares with Lee.  The -- the statute created the
right to Social Security, and there the Court said you
can't deprive employees of a statutory right because of
your religious beliefs.  So Lee is contrary to the point
you're making.
MR. CLEMENT:  There, too, I have to
respectfully disagree, because if you remember the facts
of Lee, Lee is brought not just by the employer, but by
the employee.  So the particular employees there don't
have a beef with what he's doing at all.  And I think
when they're talking about third-party burdens there,
what the Court is really talking about is the -- the
burdens of everybody else who contributes into a system
where uniformity, to use the Court's words, was
indispensable.
And so if I could, though, I think, just to
illustrate why it's sort of double counting to count the
mandated issue here as being what gives the burden to
the third party or the benefit on the third party.
Imagine two hypotheticals.  One is Congress passes a
statute and says I have to destroy all of my books,
including my Bibles.  Another statute, Congress comes in
and says I have to give all of my books, including all
of my Bibles, to you.
Now, in the second case, I suppose you could
say that a RFRA claim somehow gets rid of your statutory
entitlement to my Bibles, but I don't think, since it's
the very benefit that we're talking about that's at
issue there, I don't think -- I think that really is
double counting and I don't think those two hypothetical
statutes should be analyzed any differently.
The other thing, though, about burdens, and
I think it should go -- this is the fourth point -- that
should go into the compelling interest test --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, Mr. Clement, isn't
that just a way of saying that you think that this isn't
a good statute, because it asks one person to subsidize
another person.  But Congress has made a judgment and
Congress has given a statutory entitlement and that
entitlement is to women and includes contraceptive
coverage.  And when the employer says, no, I don't want
to give that, that woman is quite directly, quite
tangibly harmed.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, I think
you could say the same thing about my Bible
hypothetical.
But I do have one last thing to say about
burdens.  And I do think when you think about impacts on
third parties, not all of these burdens are created
equal.  And that, too, I think is borne out in this
Court's cases.  And the most relevant factor is, is
there some alternative way for the government to
ameliorate the burden.
And I think about two types of, kind of
accommodations, if you will.  You get sort of Title VII
with a very narrow accommodation.  And then you have
conscience clauses that allow medical providers,
including for-profit medical providers, not to provide
abortions.
Now, each of those has a burden on third
parties, but I would respectfully suggest they're
different.  In the case of the employee who's been
subject to racial discrimination, even if they can get
another job, that racial discrimination is a unique
injury to them that you can't remedy unless you tell the
employer, don't discriminate on the basis of race.
Now, in the context of the conscience
clause, if a woman can't get an abortion from her
preferred provider, that's surely a significant burden
on her.  But we don't view that as trumping the
conscience clause, because she can get the abortion
through another mechanism.
Here, as your question rightfully
highlights, all we're really talking about is who's
going to pay for a subsidy that the government prefers.
This is not about access to the contraception.  It's
about who's going to pay for the government's preferred
subsidy.  And I think in that context, there are ample
alternative ways to address any burdens on third
parties.  And that goes right to the least --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It would make no
difference if it were -- there are 20 FDA-approved
contraceptives, all of them covered by the Healthcare
Act.
MR. CLEMENT:  I think --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You -- you picked out, in
one case what, three, and the other case four?  Suppose
the employer says contraceptives all together are
against my religion, so I'm not going to give any
contraceptive coverage.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, obviously,
Justice Ginsburg, I didn't pick these out.  I mean, my
clients and their religious beliefs identified these as
problematic.  There are certainly --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But your argument, it
seems to me, would apply just as well if the employer
said no contraceptives.
MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's a fair point,
Justice Ginsburg, and the government's own
accommodations, where they offer them to religious
groups and religious employers like nonprofit hospitals,
also applies to whatever the religious beliefs of that
provider are.  So if they extend to all 20, then the
exemption's applied to all 20.  If they only extend to
four, then the exemption applies to all four.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Are there ways of
accommodating the interests of the women who may want
these particular drugs or devices without imposing a
substantial burden on the employer who has the religious
objection to it?
MR. CLEMENT:  There are ample less
restrictive alternatives, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What are they?
MR. CLEMENT:  And I think they all flow from
this fact that this is ultimately about who's going to
pay for a substitute --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Those are alternatives
that you're asking the government to incur or the person
to incur.  There isn't an alternative that doesn't put a
cost on someone else.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, it's -- it's -- it's
funny about this particular mandate because the
government's position is this is actually a cost-free
mandate; that whatever you pay out in contraceptions,
you're going to make up in not having to pay for other
coverages.  And so one alternative, one less restrictive
alternative is what's done in the accommodation for
nonprofit employers like hospitals, where basically they
tell the insurance carrier or the plan administer that
you pick up the cost for this and then essentially it'll
be cost neutral from you.
But I don't think there's anything sort of
sacrosanct, if you will, about having the government pay
for its preferred subsidy as a less restrictive
alternative.  And that's essentially what the government
does for those employees who have employers -- under 50
employers.  If those employees -- if the employer
doesn't provide healthcare, those employees go on to the
exchanges with a subsidy from the government.  Now, they
can do the same thing for objecting religious employers.
They just have chosen not to.
If I may reserve my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
Mr. Clement.
General Verrilli.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
The touchstone for resolving this case is
the principle Justice Jackson articulated in Prince v.
Massachusetts.  As he said, "Limitations which of
necessity bound religious freedom begin to operate
whenever activities begin to affect or collide with the
liberties of others or of the public.  Adherence to that
principle is what makes possible the harmonious
functioning of a society like ours, in which people of
every faith live and work side by side."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's a statement
that is inconsistent with RFRA, isn't it?  The whole
point of RFRA is that Congress wanted to provide
exceptions for the religious views of particular --
including proprietors, individuals.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, Mr. Chief Justice, I
don't think so at all.  In fact, the -- although I
was -- of course, I was referring to Justice Jackson's
words for their wisdom because it wasn't the opinion of
the Court.  But see, Jackson --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah.  But the
wisdom you cited is the idea that you don't have
imposed, on the basis of religious beliefs, exemptions
or -- or limitations.  And it seems to me that was the
whole point of RFRA, to tell the courts that that is
exactly what you should do unless the exception
satisfies the strict scrutiny test.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, but I think --
well, unless it satisfies the -- the pre-Smith standards
under -- under the Establishment Clause.  But I do think
that the exact same point --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's more than pre-Smith.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I take your point --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Plus --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- I take your point
about less restrictive means, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But the -- the exact same
point that Justice Jackson made in Prince, I submit, is
the point that this Court made unanimously in Cutter.
It's not -- it's that when you are analyzing what is
required under RFRA, the court must take account of the
way in which the requested accommodation will affect the
rights and interests of third parties.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, is it your argument
that providing the accommodation that's requested here
would violate the Establishment Clause?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It's not our argument
that it would violate the Establishment Clause.  But it
is our argument that you -- in any RFRA case, including
this one, you have to consider the impact on third
parties, because otherwise, you will be skating on thin
constitutional ice.
And so Justice Kennedy, you asked about
principles that -- that surround statutory construction.
Avoidance is one of them.  And that was why the Court
unanimously in Cutter said that in every RFRA case when
you're considering an accommodation, you have to weigh
the effect on third parties.  And that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where -- where is that in
RFRA?  I mean, what -- what factor of RFRA do you fold
that in under?  Is -- is that part of the compelling
State interest requirement or -- or substantial burden
requirement?  Where -- where is it in RFRA?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I'd like -- I think the
answer is that it could inform every operative provision
in RFRA.  We have said that it should inform the court's
interpretation of who counts as a person.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If -- if they wanted you to
balance -- balance the interest of the religious
objector against the interest of other individuals,
they -- they made no reference to that in RFRA at all.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They said unless the
government has a compelling State interest.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And the compelling -- and
certainly compelling interest analysis certainly does
require consideration of the interests of third parties.
Of course, what the court -- what the Congress said in
RFRA, in explaining how the compelling interest test was
to work, was that it was to strike a sensible balance
between claims for religious liberty and governmental
interests.
And -- and, of course, Lee is one of the
pre-Smith cases that provides the governing law.  And I
would submit it is really the only case from this Court
in which the request for an exemption under the Free
Exercise Clause had the effect of extinguishing a
statutorily-guaranteed benefit.  Because in Lee, had the
employer gotten the exemption from providing Social
Security, the consequence would have been that the
employees would have been disqualified from receiving
Social Security benefits.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that wasn't the basis
for -- for denying the claim.  The basis was that the
government has to run a uniform system that applies to
everybody.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I disagree.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you can't argue that
here because the government has made a lot of
exemptions.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I -- first of all, I
disagree with respect to Lee, that one of the points
that the Court made in Lee was that granting the
exemption from Social Security taxes to an employer
operates to impose the employer's religious faith on the
employees.  It was one of the grounds of decision.
Now -- but turning to -- I would like to
address these exemptions.  I'm happy to talk about them.
I'm happy to talk about our compelling interest at
length.  The -- now, the -- my --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if you could start
with the question of whether the -- the companies in
this case have a right to bring RFRA claims because
they're for-profit corporations.  You argue that they
can't.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, why is that?  Is it --
is it your position that there's something about the
corporate form per se that is inconsistent with the free
exercise claim?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, because, obviously,
churches can bring claims.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  But is it your
argument that there's something about engaging in a
for-profit activity that is inconsistent with a free
exercise claim?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  And if I could walk
through the -- let me, if you don't mind, just walk
through the analysis on --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, were the merchants in
the Braunfeld case engaged in for-profit activity?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So there isn't anything
inherent in --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But I think --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- in participating in a
for-profit activity that's inconsistent with corporate
form, is there?  I'm sorry, with a free exercise claim.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  But I think the
relevant question is what did Congress think it was
doing when it enacted RFRA in 1993?  What kinds of
claims did it think it was --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what is it about --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- justifying?
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- a for-profit corporation
that is inconsistent with a free exercise claim?  Do you
agree with the proposition that was endorsed by one of
the lower courts in this case, that for-profit
corporations must do nothing but maximize profits, they
cannot have other aims --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, not --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- including religious aims?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  But here's how we
look at it.  At its core --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, General.  You
answered yes to Braunfeld.  It was Jewish merchants, but
it was the merchants themselves --
GENERAL VERRILLI:
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
GENERAL VERRILLI:
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
Individuals.
-- the individuals --
Yes.
-- not the corporation
that was going to be jailed.  It was a --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, that's right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- criminal prosecution.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I understood Justice
Alito to be asking me not about the corporate form, but
about the -- the activity.  And when you have an
individual, you have an individual.  It's a person.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So whether it was a
merchant that was a corporation or not was irrelevant.
It was that the individual was --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- going to be jailed.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It was an individual making
a profit, right?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Certainly.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He was running a business
for a profit, and that was the point of -- of Justice
Alito's question, right, which I think you understood.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And I did try to answer
it, yes.  But I -- but let me say, I think the relevant
question here is what did Congress think it was doing in
1993?  And I think the answer to that has to be in --
you know, we understand the Dictionary Act provides a
broad definition of person, but the Dictionary Act
doesn't define exercise religion.  And the operative
statutory language is exercise -- person's exercise of
religion.  And so you can't look to the Dictionary Act
to define that.  But Congress told you where to look.
It told you to look to the pre-Smith case law --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And why did it tell --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- to define that.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Why did it say that?  It
changed the definition at the time when RLUIPA was
adopted, did it not, to eliminate the reference to the
First Amendment; isn't that right?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  But it -- but the
difference there was to say it didn't want courts to get
involved in the entangling enterprise of deciding what
was a central belief versus what was --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it says free exercise.
And didn't it also adopt a provision in RLUIPA saying
that -- that the exercise of religion was to be
interpreted in the broadest possible way?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think it -- it
said something more precise than that, which was that it
was to be interpreted not to be confined only to central
religious tenets.
JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  Didn't it say -- didn't
it say the term "religious exercise" includes any
exercise --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, includes any
exercise of religion, but it doesn't define what that
is.  It just says you don't draw a line between
centrality and something that may --
JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  But there is another
provision that says that, "This chapter shall be
construed in favor of a broad protection of religious
exercise to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of
this chapter and the Constitution."
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right.  And it -- but
with respect to what exercise religion means, it said
don't draw lines between centrality and non-centrality.
It didn't go beyond that and tell you what it means.
And what RFRA tells you to look to is pre-Smith case
law.  And in the entire history of this country, there
is not a single case in which a for-profit corporation
was granted an exemption on --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not a single case in which
it was denied exemption, either.  All you're saying
is --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, Lee --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that there are no cases.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, Lee was certainly a
case in which a for-profit enterprise was denied an
exemption.  Braunfeld was such a case.  Gallagher was
such a case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not on the ground that it
was a for-profit enterprise.  There is not a single case
which says that a for-profit enterprise cannot make a --
a freedom of religion claim, is there?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right.  There is not a
single case --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- holding that.  Except
that in Lee, it was critical to the Court's analysis
that the -- that the -- that Mr. Lee and his business
had chosen to enter the commercial sphere.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Isn't that a merits
question, General?  I mean, I totally understand that
argument as a -- as an argument about the merits.  I'm
not sure I understand it as a threshold claim that
this -- that the claim is not recognizable at all.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right.  Well, let me -- I
do want to move to the compelling interest analysis, but
if I could make one point in response to Your Honor's
question, that the Court's got to decide what person --
a person's exercise of religion means.  And that -- it
seems to me that it would be such a vast expansion of
what Congress must -- could have thought it was doing in
1993, when it enacted RFRA, to say that for-profit
corporations can make claims for religious exemptions to
any laws of general application that they want to
challenge.
I do -- you know, Mr. Clement says, well,
you don't have to worry about anything other than small,
tightly-knit corporations like the one at issue here.  I
take the point of the appeal of a situation like this
one.  But the way in which he suggests that you will be
able to distinguish this case from a case in which a
large corporation comes in or a public company comes in,
is that you will have more grounds to question the
sincerity of the claim.  But that raises exactly the
kinds of entanglement concerns that this Court has
always said you should try to avoid.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's his
argument for distinguishing it.  But there are others,
including the fact that it is more you avoid all of the
problems with what to do if it's a -- you know, there's
a 51 percent ownership of the shareholders, if you
simply say that it's in this type of Chapter S
Corporation that is closely held.  Whether it applies in
the other situations is -- is a question that we'll have
to await another case when a large publicly-traded
corporation comes in and says, we have religious
principles, the sort of situation, I don't think, is
going to happen.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But even with respect to
these companies, Your Honor, what are you going to do if
there's a dispute between -- let's say there are three
shareholders -- a dispute between two in the majority
and one in the minority?  You're going to have to get
yourself involved -- the courts will have to get
themselves involved in all kinds of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whoever controls the
corporation.  Whoever controls the corporation
determines what the party --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And then -- and the
minority shareholder will say, well, this is -- under
state law, this is an act of oppression and this
is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's a
question of State corporate law.  It's not a question of
who can bring an action under RFRA.
Could I just raise -- eight courts of
appeals, every court of appeal to have looked at the
situation have held that corporations can bring racial
discrimination claims as corporations.
Now, does the government have a position on
whether corporations have a race?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  We think those are
correct and that this situation is different.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that -- so that a
corporation does have a race for purposes of
discrimination laws.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, not that the
corporation has a race, but that corporations can bring
those claims.  But you're not interpreting -- in that
situation, all you're interpreting is the word "person"
in a statute, not exercise of religion, which is what
makes it different here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So those -- those
cases involve construction of the term "person"?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, but only "person."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the person -- the
corporation can bring as a person a claim of racial
discrimination.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's correct, but not
exercise of religion.  That's the difference.  But let
me, if I could, we think that part of the problem here
and the reason we make the argument we do at the
threshold about why you ought not recognize claims under
RFRA for for-profit corporations is that they are going
to predictively give rise to the kinds of issues you
have in this case in which the exemption is going to
impose a burden on third parties or extinguish rights of
third parties, employees or others, and that that --
that really can't be what Congress was thinking about.
But even if you --
JUSTICE ALITO:  If you say they can't even
get their -- they can't even get their -- their day in
court, you're saying something pretty, pretty strong.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And I understand, but if
Your Honor disagrees with me -- if the Court doesn't
agree with this position at the threshold, the same
considerations with respect to the harms of third
parties definitely play into the compelling-interest
analysis.
In fact, under RFRA, the standard, the
precise standard of the statute says the government must
meet is that it must show that the application of the
law to the particular parties here, Conestoga and Hobby
Lobby, is in furtherance of the government's compelling
interest.  That's the test.  So the question here is
whether having Hobby Lobby and Conestoga provide this
coverage is in furtherance of the government's interests
in ensuring that this kind of preventive service
coverage is available and, in particular, the
contraceptive coverage that's included within it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it your position that
part of the compelling interest here is that you have to
protect the integrity -- the operational integrity of
the whole Act?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It is part of our
argument, absolutely.  And -- but it -- but there is in
addition to that, much more --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does that mean the
constitutionality of the whole Act has to be examined
before we accept your view?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think it has been
examined, Your Honor, is my recollection.
(Laughter.)
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But -- but with respect
to -- but with respect to the -- there is a
particularized interest here in that what we are talking
about is a question of whether 14,000 employees and
their families get access to this contraceptive
coverage.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- you have exempted a
whole class of corporations and you've done so under
your view not because of RFRA.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So let me -- let me go to
that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, what -- what kind of
constitutional structure do we have if the Congress can
give an agency the power to grant or not grant a
religious exemption based on what the agency determined?
I recognize delegation of powers rules are somewhat
moribund insofar as their enforcement in this Court.
But when we have a First Amendment issue of -- of this
consequence, shouldn't we indicate that it's for the
Congress, not the agency to determine that this
corporation gets the exemption on that one, and not even
for RFRA purposes, for other purposes.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And, Your Honor, I do
think that it was appropriate for the agency, in
exercising its delegated authority here, to take into
account the special solicitude that under our
constitutional order churches receive.  And it's
important to understand, and I want to walk through
the -- this question of exemptions very carefully
because I think there's a lot of confusion here that
needs to be cleared up, that all that the -- all that
the government has done is say that churches, because of
that special solicitude, which the Court recognized in
Hosanna-Tabor, churches get an exemption.
The nonprofit religious organizations don't
get an exemption.  There's an accommodation there
provided, but that accommodation results in the
employees receiving access to this -- to the
contraceptive coverage, so that doesn't diminish the
government's compelling interest.
The Tenth Circuit and my friends on the
other side have relied on this idea that employers with
fewer than 50 employees are somehow exempt.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you gave this
exemption, according to your brief, without reference to
the policies of RFRA.  What -- what were the policies
that you were implementing?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, with respect to --
as I said, with respect to the churches, it was the
special solicitude that churches receive under our
Constitution under the First Amendment.
But with respect -- now with respect to the
employers 50 and under, it's just not right to say that
there's any kind of an exemption.  If they offer health
insurance, they're subject to exactly the same
per-employee, per-day penalty as larger corporations,
exactly the same risk of Labor Department enforcement,
exactly the same risk of an ERISA suit by the plan
beneficiaries.  There is no possible way to look at the
statutory scheme and conclude there is an exemption
there.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
grandfathered plans?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.
the grandfathered plans.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
What about the
Let me talk about
Well, just before
you -- so one thing I'd like you to address, the dispute
arose with Mr. Clement about how long they were going to
be in effect.  Can you make a representation to us about
how long the grandfathering is going to be in effect?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I -- I can't give you a
precise figure as to -- there's a clear downward
trajectory.  There's significant movement downward every
year in the numbers.  There's every reason to think
that's going to continue.  I can't give you a precise
time when that is going to be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can you give me an
approximate time, if not a precise one?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I -- I can't give you a
representation of exactly how low that number is going
to go and exactly how long it's going to take.  But I
think what you're talking about is a period in which
that number is going to go to a very, very low level
over a several year period.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if you can't
tell us, and I don't fault you for not being able to
tell us, when the grandfathering is going to end,
shouldn't we assume in our analysis that it is current
and, as far as we can tell, not going to end?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  I don't that's
right, Your Honor.  And I think -- let's -- let's look
at this, if we could, in toto.  That with respect to
grandfathering, it's to be expected that employers and
insurance companies are going to make decisions that
trigger the loss of that so-called grandfathered status
under the -- under the governing regulation.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it true with respect
to the grandfathered plans that the regulations required
immediate compliance with certain requirements, but not
with preventive care requirements; isn't that right?
Let me read you what HHS said in the regulation:  "With
certain particularly significant protections,
particularly significant protections, Congress required
grandfathered health plans to comply with a subset of
the Affordable Care Act's health reform provisions.  On
the other hand, grandfathered health plans are not
required to comply with certain other requirements of
the Affordable Care Act; for example, the requirement
that preventive health services be covered without any
cost sharing."
So isn't HHS saying there, quite
specifically, these, in our view, are not within this
subset of particularly significant requirements as to
which there must be immediate compliance?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, the -- the question
would be whether there's a compelling interest in
compliance with these requirements.  And I -- I'd like
to make two points in response to Your Honor's question.
First with respect to this issue of delay, which I
think, Mr. Chief Justice, your question raised, and my
friend on the other side has put a lot of weight on, I'd
refer the Court to the ADA.  I don't think anybody would
doubt that the Americans with Disabilities Act advances
interest of the highest order.  But when Congress
enacted that, it put a two-year delay on the
applicability of the discrimination provision.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, isn't that
because you're talking about building ramps and things
like that?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  No, Your Honor.
There's an even longer delay with respect to those kinds
of provisions, but it's just a basic prohibition of
discrimination two-year delay, and no one would doubt
there's a compelling interest here.  And with -- and
take -- take Title VII.  My friends on the other side
have said, well, this is different because there's so
many more people who are going to not have this coverage
under the grandfathered plan.  But with respect to Title
VII, of course, it's still the case that -- that
employers with 15 or fewer people are not subject to
that law, and that's 80 percent of the employers in the
country.  And if you run the math, that's -- it's at
least 80 percent -- that's -- it's going to be somewhere
between 10 and 22 million people who are not within the
coverage.  No one would say that because the coverage is
incomplete in that respect, that Title VII -- enforcing
Title VII doesn't advance --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Those were
decisions -- those were decisions that Congress made,
right?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the
grandfathering is not a decision that Congress made, is
it?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, the way in which
it's implemented is a decision that the agency has made,
that's true.  But even with respect to the preventive
services, I don't think anyone would say that there's
not a compelling interest in advancing colorectal cancer
screening and immunizations and the things that the
preventive services provisions provide in addition to
contraceptive coverage.  I just think this is a
compelling interest under any understanding of the term.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I just want -- before you
get to this point, and my question reflects no point of
view at all on my behalf.  I just -- but I took
Mr. Clement, one of his points, which I thought was an
important one.  He says there are some people here who
strongly object to helping with abortions which include
abortifacient contraceptives.  Everybody says, yes, they
do object to that and that's sincere.  So he's not
saying this, but I might.
But there is a compelling interest in
women's health and in the health of the family, and
they're not having a religious objection to taking it.
And so the government has said provide it.
Then he says, but there is a less
restrictive way, and the less restrictive way is the
government pays for it.  Says it wouldn't cost much.
You'd have to have another piece of paper that would go
to the insurance company that would say, insofar as your
employer has a sincere objection against paying this,
the government will pay for it.
Now, what I want to hear, and this is not
coming from any point of view, I want to hear your
precise answer to that kind of argument.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  They did argue -- I
will point out, for the first time at the podium this
morning -- that a less restrictive means would be to
extend the accommodation that currently exists --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not interested in
whether they made the argument sooner or later.  What I
want to hear from you is I want to hear -- and it's
not -- you've thought about this.  I want to hear your
answer to that kind of argument.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to be sure you have
a chance to give it.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  The answer -- I think
there are two answers to it.  Assuming it's before the
Court -- and I'm going to answer your honest question
directly, but I do want to make a prefatory point here,
which is that under the law, under Ashcroft v. ACLU, for
example, the burden on the government is to show that
proposed less restrictive alternatives are not equally
effective.  If they don't propose it, we don't have a
burden to refute it.
Having said that, we can refute it.  Now,
there are two -- and there are two ways.  The first is,
they claim that they don't think that the accommodation
is a less restrictive means, I take it, because -- or
they haven't raised it before today, because they
believe that RFRA would require exemptions to that too,
such that if you were -- if you were to provide the
accommodation in which the insurance company comes in
and provides the contraception if the employer signs the
form, they would say that that -- signing the form also
makes them complicit in the central activity, and that
therefore RFRA provides an exemption there, too.
And of course the test is whether the
proposed alternative advances the government's
interests as effectively.  And if it is going to be
subject to exactly the same RFRA objections by exactly
the same class of people asking for it, it's not going
to serve the government's interest as effectively
because the RFRA exemption will result in no coverage
there.
The second point being that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So don't make them sign a
piece of paper.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, whether they sign
the piece of paper or not, if they make the RFRA claim
there, which they have with respect to that
accommodation, it will result in it being less effective
in terms of accomplishing the compelling interest.  In
addition --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, we can ask Mr. Clement
what his position is on this.  But you say they have
already asserted that it would be inconsistent with RFRA
as they understand it to provide for a for-profit
corporation, like the ones involved here, the sort of
accommodation that HHS has extended to so-called
religious nonprofits, perhaps with the modification that
was included in our stay order in the Little Sisters
case.  Have they taken a position on that?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  You'll have to ask them.
I don't think they have.  But they have studiously
avoided arguing this as a less restrictive alternative,
and I take it it's because their theory, at least, would
lead one to the conclusion you would have to provide a
RFRA objection.  But now the -- yes, thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice.
The second point is that you're talking
about a very open-ended increase in the cost to the
government.  Now, we don't know how much that cost would
be.  The reason is because, since this wasn't litigated
in the lower courts, there's not a record on it.  So I
can't tell you what that -- what that increased cost is
going to be, but it could be quite considerable.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're talking about, what,
three or four birth controls, not all of them, just
those that are abortifacient.  That's not terribly
expensive stuff, is it?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, to the contrary.
And two points to make about that.  First, of course
the -- one of the methods of contraception they object
to here is the IUD.  And that is by far and away the
method of contraception that is most effective, but has
the highest upfront cost and creates precisely the kind
of cost barrier that the preventive services provision
is trying to break down.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought that -- I was
taken by your answer.  I thought it was the government's
position that providing coverage for the full range of
contraceptives and other devices and drugs that are
covered here is actually financially neutral for an
insurance company, that that reduces other costs that
they would incur.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It is for the insurance
company, but for the woman who is going to not get the
benefit of the statute if the exemption is granted --
JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  No.  If she -- if she
has the coverage through the insurance company but the
employer has nothing to do with arranging for that.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, so, in other words,
if they haven't raised a RFRA objection to the
alternative, but that -- but as I said, you know, the
logic of their position is that you would get a RFRA
objection.  It can't be --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Still, I want to get --
press this a little further, and I don't want you simply
to just agree with what I'm about to say.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Don't worry.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I mean -- I mean, after
all, somebody, a taxpayer, might say, "I don't want to
pay for this small war."  And it would be a religious
ground, and it would be very, very little money, in
fact, that you take from him.  Or the church might say,
"I want a Sunday morning reduction in the cost of
municipal parking."  And by the way, that will not only
not cost the government anything, they'll make money
because nobody parks there on Sunday, particularly with
this high a fee.
Now, I'm thinking of -- I'm trying to figure
out where this case fits in that spectrum because I
think the answer to the first two questions is no.  And
I know, so you're just going to agree, and that's what I
don't want.  I want to understand your thinking on that.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  On that point, I think
that question plugs into our view of what the
substantial burden test requires, that their view of
substantial burden is if you have a sincere religious
belief and there is any law with a meaningful penalty
that imposes on you pressure to do something
inconsistent with your belief, then you may pass the
substantial burden test.
I think the problem with that test as they
formulate it, is that under the two hypotheticals that
you just gave, Justice Breyer, you've got a substantial
burden in those situations, because if you don't pay the
tax you can go to jail, for example.
And so we think the substantial burden
analysis has got to be more strenuous than that.  It's
got to incorporate principles of attenuation and
proximate cause, and that when you think about this case
where the requirement is to purchase insurance which
enables actions by others, that you're really closer to
the tax situation than to imposing a direct obligation
to act.
So that's how we would think about that
issue.  But now, with respect to --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. -- General Verrilli,
isn't that really a question of theology or moral
philosophy, which has been debated for -- by many
scholars and adherents to many religions.  A does
something that B thinks is immoral.  How close a
connection does there have to be between what B does
that may have some -- that may provide some assistance
to A in order for B to -- to be required to refrain from
doing that -- that action.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It's true that it's a
difficult question.  But it isn't --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It is a religious question
and it's a moral question.  And you want us to provide a
definitive secular answer to it?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, but I do think the
problem, Justice Alito, is that this Court has
recognized, and certainly the courts of appeals have
recognized, that there is a difference.  You accept the
sincerity of the belief, but the Court still has to make
a judgment of its own about what constitutes a
substantial burden, or otherwise, for example, the tax
thing would be a substantial burden.  Or we cited a D.C.
Circuit case in which prisoners objected to giving DNA
samples and the court said:  We accept the sincerity of
that belief, but it's up to us to decide whether that's
a actually substantial burden.
In the Bowen case in this Court, the Court
accepted the sincerity of the belief that the use of the
child's Social Security number would offend religious
belief and commitments, but said they still had to make
a judgment about whether that was a substantial burden.
So it does have to be, with all due respect,
part of the analysis.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I still don't understand
how HHS exercised its judgment to grant the exemption to
nonreligious corporations if you say it was not
compelled by RFRA.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then it must have been
because the health care coverage was not that important.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It didn't grant an
exemption to any nonreligious organizations, Justice
Kennedy.  It granted an exemption to churches, and that
was it.  With respect to religious nonprofits, it
constructed an accommodation, but the accommodation
delivers the contraceptive coverage to the employees of
the nonprofits.  It just does it through an indirect
means.  But there is no diminution of the -- there's no
basis for questioning the government's interest with
respect to that accommodation because the employees get
the coverage, just as they would --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that of
course is an issue that's being hotly litigated right
now, right?  Whether the employees can get the coverage
when you're talking about the religious organizations.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, that's exactly why
I think you can't look to that as a less restrictive --
that accommodation, extending that accommodation to
for-profit corporations.  As a less restrictive
alternative.  Precisely because it's being hotly
litigated whether RFRA will require exemptions to that,
as well.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you're
relying -- you're relying on it to make your point with
respect to the accommodation, and then you're
criticizing your friend for relying on the same thing in
making his points.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think -- I think
what Justice Kennedy -- I took Justice Kennedy to be
asking me, Mr. Chief Justice, was whether the
government's choice to provide that accommodation
reflected a judgment on the part of the government that
this was something less than a compelling interest, and
I don't think that inference is possible, because the
government was trying to use that accommodation to
ensure that the contraceptives were delivered.  So, with
all due respect, I don't think there is an inconsistency
there.
And I -- and I do think, if I could, with
respect to this issue of whether there are exemptions
that defeat a compelling interest, that I submit would
be a very dangerous principle for this Court to adopt in
the form that my friends on the other side have offered
it, because not only would you then be in a position
where it would be very hard to see how Title VII
enforcement could be justified by compelling interest in
response to a RFRA objection, ADA enforcement, FMLA
enforcement, all kinds of things.  And I do think --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Title VII was passed
before 1993, so it wouldn't apply -- RFRA wouldn't apply
to Title VII.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think -- with all
due respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think you could claim a
RFRA exemption from Title VII.  And the problem here
would be that -- and I think one of the things that's
significant about the position that my friends on the
other side are taking here, is that with respect to
exemptions, for example, from the Title VII requirement
against discrimination on the basis of religion and
hiring, Congress made a quite clear judgment to provide
a very narrow exemption:  Churches and religious
educational institutions and religious associations, and
that's it.  Nobody else can claim an exemption under
Title VII.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except that they passed
RFRA after that.  That made a lot of sense.  But the
question is they passed RFRA after that.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But I think the further
question, Your Honor, is whether you would interpret
RFRA in a manner where you would essentially obliterate
that carefully crafted -- or what Congress meant to do
was to obliterate that carefully crafted exemption and
instead say that every for-profit corporation could make
a request like that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if Congress
feels as strongly about this as you suggest, they can
always pass an exemption, an exception to RFRA, which
they have done on other occasions.  And they haven't
done it here.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, with all due
respect, Your Honor, I think you could make the same
argument either way in this case, that the question here
is what Congress thought it was doing in 1993, and we
don't think, given the long history and the fact that
not only do you have no case in which a for-profit
corporation ever had a successful --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we've already
discussed that there is no case holding that they can't,
right?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  In addition, if you look
at the history of exemptions and accommodations in our
legislation, State and Federal legislation may extend to
churches and religious nonprofits, and that's -- and
individuals.  And that's where the line has been drawn
in our legislation historically.  There just is nothing
in our current --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under your view, a profit
corporation could be forced -- in principle, there are
some statutes on the books now which would prevent it,
but -- could be forced in principle to pay for
abortions.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  I think, as you
said, the law now -- the law now is to the contrary.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your reasoning would
permit that.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think that -- you
know, I don't think that that's -- I think it would
depend on the law and it would depend on the entity.  It
certainly wouldn't be true, I think, for religious
nonprofits.  It certainly wouldn't be true for a church.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm talking about a profit
corporation.  You say profit corporations just don't
have any standing to vindicate the religious rights of
their shareholders and owners.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think that if it
were for a for-profit corporation and if such a law like
that were enacted, then you're right, under our theory
that the for-profit corporation wouldn't have an ability
to sue.  But there is no law like that on the books.  In
fact, the law is the opposite.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, I lost
track of that.  There is no law on the books that does
what?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That makes a requirement
of the kind that Justice Kennedy hypothesized.  The law
is the opposite.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, flesh it out a
little more.  What -- there is no law on the books that
does what?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That requires for-profit
corporations to provide abortions.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What if a law like that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Isn't that what we
are talking about in terms of their religious beliefs?
One of the religious beliefs is that they have to pay
for these four methods of contraception that they
believe provide abortions.  I thought that's what we had
before us.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It is their sincere
belief and we don't question that.  But I will say, and
I do think this is important and I say it with all
respect, that that is how they -- that is the judgment
that they make.  It is not the judgment that Federal law
or State law reflects.  Federal law and State law which
does -- which do preclude funding for abortions don't
consider these particular forms of contraception to be
abortion.
With all due respect, I would say that I
think that, you know, we've got about 2 million women
who rely on the IUD as a method of birth control in this
country.  I don't think they think they are engaged in
abortion in doing that.  It is their belief.  It's
sincere.  We respect it.
But it isn't a belief that we think is
reflected in Federal or State law or our traditions of
where that line is drawn.  And so -- and I do think that
that is what makes this a difficult case.  I agree.
And if you disagree with our position at the
threshold that corporations -- that even though you have
a situation, and we acknowledge you can have situations,
in which a tightly knit group of -- a small group of
tightly knit individuals own and operate a corporation
where there is appeal to that, to the argument that they
ought to recognize a claim of exercising religion in
those circumstances.
The problem, I would submit, is with the
implications of doing it, the implications for
entanglement and making the judgments when you move past
that group, the administrability problems, and the
problems of inviting the kinds of claims that are
predictably going to impose harms on third parties.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What about the implications
of saying that no for-profit corporation can raise any
sort of free exercise claim at all and nobody associated
with the for-profit corporation can raise any sort of
free exercise claim at all?
Let me give you this example.  According to
the media, Denmark recently prohibited kosher and halal
slaughter methods because they believe that they are
inhumane.  Now, suppose Congress enacted something like
that here.  What would the -- what would a corporation
that is a kosher or halal slaughterhouse do?  They would
simply -- they would have no recourse whatsoever.  They
couldn't even get a day in court.  They couldn't raise a
RFRA claim.  They couldn't raise a First Amendment
claim.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I'm not sure they
couldn't raise a First Amendment claim, Justice Alito.
I think if you had a targeted law like that, that
targeted a specific religious practice, that -- I don't
think it is our position that they couldn't make a free
exercise claim in that circumstance and so --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but you're getting
away from the hypothetical.  Say -- Justice Alito's
hypothetical was that the impetus for this was humane
treatment of animals.  There was no animus to religion
at all, which in the Church of Lukumi, there was an
animus to the religion.  So we're taking that out of the
hypothetical.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Exactly.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right.  Well, I think if
it were targeted only at the practices of the -- the
kosher and halal practices, then I think you would have
an issue of whether it's a targeted law or not.  But
even if it is --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, they say no animal may
be slaughtered unless it's stunned first, unless the
animal is rendered unconscious before it is slaughtered.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think in that
circumstance, you would have, I think, an ability for
customers to bring suit.  I think you might recognize
third party standing on behalf of the corporation -- on
the corporations, on behalf of customers.  So a suit
like that could be brought.
But even if you disagree with me at the
threshold, even if you disagree with us with respect to
the kinds of risks that we think you will be inviting if
you hold that for-profit corporations can bring these
claims, when you get to the compelling interest
analysis, the rights of the third party employees are at
center stage here.  And that's -- I think that's the
point of critical importance in thinking about this
case.  And I think, frankly, the point that has been
just left on the sidelines by my friends on the other
side.
The consequence of holding here that the
RFRA exemption applies is not a situation like ones in
which this Court under the Free Exercise Clause or under
RFRA have recognized exemptions in the past.  Those have
always been situations where it's a relationship between
the individual and the government and granting the
exemption might result in the government not being able
to enforce the law with respect to the individual, but
--
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, the point that
Justice Alito was making is that -- take five Jewish or
Muslim butchers and what you're saying to them is if
they choose to work under the corporate form, which is
viewed universally, you have to give up on that form the
Freedom of Exercise Clause that you'd otherwise have.
Now, looked at that way, I don't think it
matters whether they call themselves a corporation or
whether they call themselves individuals.  I mean, I
think that's the question you're being asked, and I need
to know what your response is to it.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think our
response is what the Court said in Part 3 of the Lee
opinion, which is that once you make a choice to go into
the commercial sphere, which you certainly do when you
incorporate as a for-profit corporation, you are making
a choice to live by the rules that govern you and your
competitors in the commercial sphere.
But even if you disagree with me about that,
what I'd like to leave the Court with, is what I think
is the most important point here, is that if this
exemption were granted, it will be the first time under
the Free Exercise Clause or under RFRA in which this
Court or any court has held that an employer may take --
may be granted an exemption that extinguishes
statutorily-guaranteed benefits of fundamental
importance.
Lee came to exactly the opposite conclusion
with respect to Social Security benefits, that you --
that it was imperative that the employee's interest be
protected.  And that is the fundamental problem with the
position that my friends on the other side raise here,
that they leave the third-party employees entirely out
of the equation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's okay for
not-for-profit corporations to do that with respect to
all of their employees, and some of them are pretty big
operations --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that's okay there?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, we don't think that.
We don't -- we're not drawing a line between non-profits
and profits.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They can make -- you allow
them to make this religious objection, don't you?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  No.  Religious
non-profits get an accommodation in which their
employees get the contraception.  But we are not drawing
a line between for-profit and profit.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they don't have to pay
for it, right?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  The --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you could set that up
this way, that these people don't have to pay for it.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, as I've said a
couple of times, they haven't asked for that until this
morning.  But the fundamental point here is that you
would be extinguishing statutorily-guaranteed health
benefits of fundamental importance to these employees,
and that is something that this Court has never done.
And I submit that Congress can't have thought it was
authorizing it when it enacted RFRA in 1993.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.
Mr. Clement, four minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF PRIVATE PARTIES
MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Just a few points in rebuttal.  Let me start
with the Abortion Conscious Clause.  It's -- because it
tells you something about where Congress has drawn the
line and it tells you the consequences of the
government's position.  Historically, those conscious
provisions have applied to all medical providers,
including for-profit medical providers.  But we learned
today that as far as the government's concerned, that's
just Congress' judgment.  If Congress changes its
judgment and says that a for-profit medical provider has
to provide an abortion, RFRA doesn't apply.  That, with
all due respect, cannot be what Congress had in mind
when it passed RFRA.  They also suggested if a kosher
market takes the trouble to incorporate itself, then it
has no free exercise claims at all.
Now, you can go back and read the Crown
kosher case.  I took it as common ground, that all nine
justices thought that if the Massachusetts law there had
forced Crown kosher to be open on Saturday, that that
would be a free exercise claim notwithstanding the
incorporation.
The second point I want to talk about is the
least restrictive alternatives.  In a colloquy with
Justice Scalia, the Solicitor General points out that
yeah, well, it's a little bit different from the
pre-Smith law because now you have the less restrictive
alternatives analysis.
That's not a small difference.  That's a
major difference.  And it's really the easiest way to
rule against the government in this case.  Because you
have a unique situation here where their policy is about
a government -- a subsidy for a government- preferred
health care item, and the question is who pays?  The
government paying or a third-party insurer paying is a
perfectly good least restrictive alternative.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we go back to the
start of my question, that would be essentially the same
for vaccines, blood transfusions, non-pork products, the
government has to pay for all of the medical needs that
an employer thinks or claims it has a religious
exemption to?
MR. CLEMENT:  Not necessarily,
Justice Sotomayor.  It will depend on how you --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because those things are
more important?
MR. CLEMENT:  No, not because they're
more --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's really the amount
of money --
MR. CLEMENT:  -- important.  But the easiest
way to distinguish them is if the government's already
provided this accommodation for religious employers.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but they --
MR. CLEMENT:  And with all due respect --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- they make exemptions
for vaccines, presumably, to some people on some basis,
but we have a tax code that applies to everybody, but we
have a million exemptions.
Does the creation of the exemption relieve
me from paying taxes when I have a sincere religious
belief that taxes are immoral?
MR. CLEMENT:  I think Lee says that taxes
are different and not all exemptions are created equal,
because some exemptions undermine the compelling
interest.  Now, the reason --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't there a Federal
program that pays for vaccines for any children who are
not covered by insurance for those vaccines?
MR. CLEMENT:  There is, Justice Alito.  Of
course, there's also Title X, which provides for
contraception coverage, which is another least
restrictive alternative.
But I do want to get on the table that it is
not true, that we have not suggested that the
accommodation provided to religious employers, like
nonprofit hospitals, that's not something I invented at
the podium.
If you look at page 58 of our brief, the red
brief, we specifically say that one of the least
restrictive alternatives would be -- the most obvious
least restrictive alternative is for the government to
pay for their favorite contraception methods themselves.
Later in that paragraph, the only full
paragraph on the page, we say, "And indeed, the
government has attempted something like that with
respect to certain objective employers -- objective
employees -- employers," and we cite the Federal
Register provision where there is the accommodation
provision.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Will your clients claim
that filling out the form, if -- you're saying they
would claim an exemption like the churches have already?
MR. CLEMENT:  We haven't been offered that
accommodation, so we haven't had to decide what kind of
objection, if any, we would make to that.  But it's
important to recognize that as I understand that
litigation, the objection is not to the fact that the
insurance or the provider pays for the contraception
coverage.  The whole debate is about how much complicity
there has to be from the employer in order to trigger
that coverage.  And whatever the answer is for Little
Sisters of the Poor, presumably you can extend the same
thing to my clients and there wouldn't be a problem with
that.
If I could have just one second more to say
that the agency point that Justice Kennedy has pointed
to is tremendously important, because Congress spoke, it
spoke in RFRA.  Here the agency has decided that it's
going to accommodate a subset of the persons protected
by RFRA.  In a choice between what Congress has provided
and what the agency has done, the answer is clear.
Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Counsel, the case is submitted.
