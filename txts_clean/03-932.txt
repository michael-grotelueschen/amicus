JUSTICE STEVENS: The Court will now hear

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. SULLIVAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, and may it
please the Court:
This case presents two disparate views of what
kind of loss is necessary to sustain a claim for
securities fraud under the Reform Act's loss causation
requirement.
The minority view of artificial inflation
articulated by the Ninth Circuit is illogical and equates
loss with purchase, regardless of whether the investor has
suffered any economic harm. An investor does not suffer
any harm until some form of corrective disclosure occurs
and the artificial inflation is removed from the stock.
The two events must be related. There is no causal
connection between the harm and the misrepresentation
otherwise.
The majority rule correctly requires a causal
connection between the misrepresentation and a decline in
value. The -- and the statute itself is expressed in
terms of causation that a plaintiff prove that the act of
the defendant caused the loss.
When we look at the statute of the Reform Act
and other provisions, we see supporting language. In
section 21D of the Reform Act, we see under the provision
that has been known as the look-back provision that the
Congress discussed the loss in terms of trading price
after a corrective disclosure.
Similarly in section 105 of the Reform Act,
although dealing with section 12 of the Securities Act,
the Reform Act, in its one place where it actually spoke
of loss causation and its definition, defined it in terms
of depreciation in value. And the -- the depreciation in
value of the security would be attributable to the fraud.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can -- can you tell me if --
if we had not granted certiorari in the case and the Ninth
Circuit's opinion became final, what would have happened
on remand? What would have happened in the trial court?
MR. SULLIVAN: At the trial court, the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and wouldn't there have
been a -- a motion to make the pleadings more specific and
they would have then come up with a measure of damages, or
am I wrong about that?
MR. SULLIVAN: Well, the Ninth Circuit remanded
for specific reasons on repleading, which Your Honor has
articulated, and those would have occurred.
The other issues relating to loss raise
questions concerning whether some of the -- the claims
might be time barred and whether or not those claims could
be stated. So that would have raised a different issue.
In addition, throughout the pleadings of this
case -- we're now on the third complaint -- the -- the
plaintiffs have not raised that issue and have not sought
to plead causation consistent with the -- our view of the
world.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, I -- I assume
you say that the trial judge and -- and defense counsel
and -- and the trial court would have had real problems
with this opinion. What -- what were those problems --
MR. SULLIVAN: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- insofar as the measure of
loss is concerned?
MR. SULLIVAN: Well, the -- the real problems
that the trial court had and what we would continue to
espouse with this opinion is that it doesn't link the loss
with the misrepresentation. And in this case, the
misrepresentation offered occurred 9 months after the
price drop that is being sought.
I think when you -- when you carve it all back
and you look at what the real issue is, at the end of the
day, it's -- it becomes an issue of what -- what damages
does the plaintiffs' class seek.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under this opinion, how would
-- under the Ninth Circuit's opinion, how would the jury
have been instructed to come -- to calculate the loss? I
assume you have a problem with that and I want to know
what it is.
MR. SULLIVAN: The -- the problem is we wouldn't
have been able to -- to frame a clear jury instruction
that would have indicated whether or not the loss that the
jury should look at would be related to the disclosure
about Albuterol Spiros, which would have occurred in the
November time frame, or whether we would have had to step
back to the February time frame and -- and the loss that
was incurred then. And the issue would have not only
related to the -- the damages instructions but would have
related to the misrepresentation instruction.
And the -- the problem that -- that we continue
to have with the -- the case after the Ninth Circuit's
opinion is where do you look for the misrepresentation and
where do you look for the damage and how do you know that
there is a loss under the statute. You're looking at a --
at a --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What would have happened if
the disclosure about Albuterol was made before the company
announced revenue shortfalls?
MR. SULLIVAN: Well, I think that would have
been different. That would have been a disclosure prior
to the -- to the drop, and there -- I would expect under
pleading that the plaintiffs could have done, they could
have tied the two of them together and argued that the
cause of the loss was the combination of the two events in
the marketplace.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why is it difficult to figure
out what the Ninth Circuit was thinking? I -- I found it
-- am I right? I thought they said the -- the seller says
we found gold. The stock sells for $60. They have loads
of experts who say in the absence of that statement, which
was a lie, we found gold, it would have sold for $10. The
loss is $50. I mean, I take it that's their theory.
MR. SULLIVAN: That -- that would be the theory
under the Ninth Circuit.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what's wrong
with that theory?
MR. SULLIVAN: Well, the --
JUSTICE BREYER: It's clear. I mean, it's
certainly clear.
MR. SULLIVAN: The problem with -- with that
theory is that Congress has told us that the
misrepresentation has to have caused the loss and --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. They say it caused the
loss, $50.
MR. SULLIVAN: And -- and what we would be
looking for is evidence that -- that such a actual loss
occurred in response to a corrective disclosure in the
marketplace.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, doesn't it depend on --
on what you -- what you consider to be the value of the
stock. Until the disclosure of the fact that they didn't
find gold is made, the stock is still worth $60, isn't it?
MR. SULLIVAN: Yes, it is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Because everybody else thinks
they found gold too. So you're still holding stock worth
$60, if worth means its market value. Right?
MR. SULLIVAN: That is correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And we're dealing with a
special rule that looks to market value. Right? You
don't have to have the -- the representation made
explicitly to the plaintiff. It's a representation that
was made to the market at large which caused the market
value of the stock. Right?
MR. SULLIVAN: That is correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So he paid $60, he got $60.
There's no loss.
MR. SULLIVAN: And would have the ability to
continue to sell that stock for $60 in the marketplace
until such time as there was a corrective disclosure.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any other problem?
I'm trying to get a list of what the problems are with the
simple theory. Now, I've heard one that you've ratified.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and is there any other?
MR. SULLIVAN: Thank you.
The -- the other is -- is I think an issue of
certainty as to the marketplace. Remember, we are
operating on a fraud-on-the-market theory context here in
this kind of action, and in that -- in that context, when
there is a disclosure in the marketplace, you have
certainty as to what the market actually valued the
decline to be as opposed to speculation that there was in
fact inflation at the -- at the time of purchase.
The Ninth Circuit's purchase time rule in the --
in the fraud-on-the-market context doesn't necessarily
identify the decline in the value of the stock which you
can get from the marketplace, and that I think is just
better -- a better indicator.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, can we -- can they prove
this? $60. $50 is wrong, is inflated because of the
gold. It turns out that gold never existed and they knew
it. The stock is not selling for $60 anymore. It's
selling for $200. They found platinum. No one expected
it. All right. They want to prove maybe it is selling
for $200, but if we had found gold as well, it would have
sold for $250. Can they do it?
MR. SULLIVAN: The Congress has told us that we
should look for loss, and that --
JUSTICE BREYER: It's a loss. $250 versus $200.
MR. SULLIVAN: -- and that leads us to the --
the point that -- that whether the increase can actually
be pled. But if there is a disclosure that indicates that
the gold component was not part of the -- of the -- the
discoveries, and the plaintiffs can indicate that there
was an upward tick because of the platinum and a downward
movement in the stock because of the disclosure about
gold, then I think those two can be separated and pled
accordingly.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And both would be all right
because what's the difference between not getting as much
appreciation as you would have gotten if the correct
information had been out there and getting less than you
would have gotten. I mean, in both cases the shareholder
is affected the same way. They didn't get as much in one
case. So you're not distinguishing between those. I
think you're agreeing that in both cases the -- the
discovery of platinum is the shares go up, but they would
have gone up much higher if there had been gold as well.
That shareholder has a claim under your theory, doesn't
she?
MR. SULLIVAN: Well, that shareholder -- it
would depend on what has happened in the marketplace. If
there has not been a disclosure about the absence of gold,
that stock would still reflect the -- the value of the
expectation of gold.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I'm assuming that --
that there is, and so the stock goes up but not as much as
it would have.
But on the point of disclosure, there is a
difference between your position and the Government's, and
I really would like you to tell me if that's genuine or
it's my misperception. Your view is there's the
disclosure of the bad news, the lie, and the price drops.
In the Government's presentation -- and I'm reading from
page 19 -- the fraud can be revealed by means other than a
corrective disclosure and a drop in the stock price may
not be a necessary condition for establishing loss
causation in every fraud on the marketplace.
MR. SULLIVAN: Our position is we believe that a
drop in the price is necessary to demonstrate the loss.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the Government --
MR. SULLIVAN: They do.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't matter in this case,
does it? Is -- is that issue before us?
MR. SULLIVAN: In this case --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have to decide that issue
here?
MR. SULLIVAN: We don't have to decide that
issue for this case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And is it -- is it easy to
prove that -- that the price of this now valuable stock
because they found platinum would have been $40 higher had
they found gold? I mean, the burden would be on the
plaintiff to prove that -- would -- I mean, if we adopted
that theory.
MR. SULLIVAN: The plaintiff has that burden --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It would be very hard to prove,
it seems to me.
MR. SULLIVAN: And -- and at the pleading stage,
I believe that they could be segregated and -- and an
upward movement in the stock could be distinguished from a
downward movement in the stock. But the downward movement
in stock would be the focus from our standpoint.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in your view, is the
plaintiff entitled to an expectancy measure of damage, or
is it more the traditional tort measure which is out-of-
pocket losses?
MR. SULLIVAN: We don't believe that they are
entitled to any expectation damages. It would be an out-
of-pocket loss calculation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the -- is the respondents'
position properly characterized as asking for expectancy
damages or is that too simplistic a view?
MR. SULLIVAN: I -- I think that it is perhaps
inclusive of expectancy. It really depends on how you
view that price inflation theory.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think they'd be called
reliance damages. You know, I used to teach contract law.
We would call it reliance damages.
MR. SULLIVAN: And it gets back in our view to
the transaction causation distinction in the securities
cases that talk about the reliance transaction, price
inflation that occurs at the front end.
JUSTICE BREYER: If that's so then -- then on
the platinum/gold theory, you can't really recover what
would have happened if there had been gold because it
might be that the stock would have been worth $400 if
there had been gold even though 15 years earlier when he
only paid $50 for it, he's only out of pocket, at most,
$50. But if there had been gold, because of the gold
market in the world, it would have been a lot more
valuable. And you're saying he can't do that? I don't
know. Maybe that question isn't in the case, but that
strikes me as a difficult question.
MR. SULLIVAN: Following your -- your suggestion
about the price of gold, it would depend on where that --
that disclosure occurred in connection with the price of
-- the price of gold, if that disclosure occurred, and if
there was an economic loss that could be -- could be tied
to it. The passage of time here is important only insofar
as it allows for the corrective disclosure and a chance
for the market to reflect an economic loss.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Sullivan, you refer to
the disclosure as being the key point and when you measure
the -- the loss and so forth. What if the information
leaks out and there's no specific one disclosure that does
it all and the stock gradually declines over a period of
six months?
MR. SULLIVAN: I think --
JUSTICE STEVENS: How would you handle that
case?
MR. SULLIVAN: I think that a plaintiff would be
able to handle that in -- in a pleading and they would
have to identify the leaks and if there are several,
identify each of them and identify them as --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe they don't know
the leaks. The only thing they can prove is that there
was a gross false statement at the time they bought the
stock and they don't know what happened to the decline.
Later on they find out that it gradually leaked out. Do
they have to prove exactly how the information became
public?
MR. SULLIVAN: The key is that they have to
prove that the loss was connected to the misrepresentation
and that the drop in --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they -- they wouldn't
have to prove how it came out. They would just have to
prove that the market knew the truth, no matter how the
market learned the truth. I mean, if it was published in
a -- in a column by some market reporter who doesn't
disclose how he found out. So long as the market knows
the truth, isn't that all they need?
MR. SULLIVAN: So I was distinguishing -- yes is
the answer to your question. I was distinguishing a
situation where the price just trickled down and no one
knew until later. And the -- the question that Justice
Scalia poses about the -- the leak coming out over time
but it is the -- the fact that the market becomes aware of
the reason for the misrepresentation, it is in fact
appropriate.
The -- the other point that I would like to
make, in addition to the statutory scheme, is -- is this
Court's decision in Basic v. Levinson creates a tension
here, and I -- and I think a conflict that is very
important to -- to discern. The -- Basic v. Levinson
presents the fraud-on-the-market theory, and from that
fraud-on-the-market theory we have a rebuttable
presumption of reliance for transaction causation.
The Ninth Circuit's view collapses the -- the
Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit's view of transaction causation
with loss causation and presents a conflict as it relates
to that presumption. The presumption, which is based on a
well- developed, efficient capital market that gets the
information out quickly and is easily digestible -- that
-- that presumption is at odds with the Reform Act's
requirement that there be a burden of proof. If you
collapse the transaction causation and the loss causation,
you've got a head-on collision between the rebuttable
presumption of reliance and the Congress' codification of
the Loss Causation Act and the Reform Act. And we think,
at the end of the day, the Ninth Circuit's decision really
renders that conflict apparent and makes the act of
Congress in the Reform Act one that was meaningless.
The -- I think the legislative history is also
supportive of our position so far as particularly the
Senate report is very important in the -- in the phrase
where it talks about the obligation of the plaintiff to
prove that the loss in the value of the stock was caused
by the section 10(b) violation and not by other factors.
That is a critical component here of the analysis and I
think very helpful from the standpoint of the legislative
history in identifying what we have.
Finally, I -- the last point I'd like to make is
that the Reform Act from Congress was designed to and
sought to establish uniform and fairly stringent pleading
guidelines, and this was to address congressional concerns
over frivolous suits. And Congress, in enacting the
Reform Act, was not signaling any intention to relax the
requirements of section 10(b), was -- rather, was enacting
a very specific loss causation requirement. And
historically there was a very clear and distinct body of
law at the time, the Huddleston case, the Bastian case,
and that was codified. And there was a very clear
perception that Congress was acting and not collapsing the
loss causation transaction rule into the loss -- the
transaction causation into the loss causation, which I
think creates this conflict.
If there are no further questions, Justice
Stevens, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for
rebuttal.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You certainly may.
MR. SULLIVAN: Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hungar.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may
it please the Court:
In a fraud-on-the-market case, a plaintiff who
buys a security at an inflated price suffers no loss at
the time of purchase because the market continues to value
the security at the inflated price, and that's --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you tell us how you
differ with petitioner on what ought to happen here and
why?
MR. HUNGAR: Well, our view -- well, what ought
to happen in this case is that the judgment of the court
of appeals should be reversed because the court failed to
require loss causation. In effect, what the court said is
that transaction causation is sufficient. But what --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You agree with the bottom
line.
MR. HUNGAR: Yes.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, where do you disagree?
MR. HUNGAR: Well, I'm not sure that I can
accurately tell you petitioners' position, but I can tell
you our position, which is that in a fraud-on-the-market
case the plaintiff cannot -- has failed to plead loss
causation unless the plaintiff pleads that the -- the
inflation attributable to the misrepresentation or
omission has been removed or reduced from the price of the
stock through dissemination of corrective information of
some sort to the market. That does not mean that the
company must make an announcement or that there must be an
admission of fraud or that there must be really any
information, any -- any sort of formal disclosure. But if
the information is disseminated to the market such that
the market, in whole or in part, becomes aware of the
truth and adjusts the price accordingly, that price
adjustment is loss and the plaintiff has alleged loss
causation in an amount to be proven at trial.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, doesn't the general
rule 8 governing complaints -- isn't that adequate? You
have to plead under that every element of an affirmative
case.
MR. HUNGAR: That's right. Exactly right, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why is the Government
proposing that you have to follow rule 9 not 8 or some
other requirement?
MR. HUNGAR: Well, the -- I don't think the
question -- we cited rule 9(b) in our brief because fraud
must be pled with particularity and -- and that -- and
that rule applies to all the, quote, circumstances
constituting a fraud. But the Court doesn't need to
address the question because even under rule 8, the
plaintiff must allege all the elements of the cause of
action.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: We don't have to get into
that.
MR. HUNGAR: That's correct. That's absolutely
right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Hungar, if you look
at the forms of what's proper pleading under the Federal
rules on causation, the sample pleadings say, for example,
for money lent, the defendant owes the plaintiff for money
lent. Period. Or for goods sold and delivered. Nothing
more. Just alleged causation. Defendant -- plaintiff
alleges I lost X amount and it was caused by defendant.
I thought you pointed to the 9(b) rule because
fraud must be pleaded with particularity, but causation
does not, not under the rules and not under the statute.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, as we said in our brief, we
think 9(b) applies here. Obviously, this is a fraud case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that's to the --
to the allegation of fraud, but not causation.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, Congress has made very clear
that loss causation is an element of the cause of action.
The elements must be pled. In a fraud case, they must be
pled with particularity, but even -- even in a -- in a
common law --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It says -- but the fraud
must be pleaded with particularity, not all the elements
of a fraud claim.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, with respect, Your Honor, we
think circumstances -- it does not constitute fraud if
there is no loss causation. At least it certainly doesn't
constitute securities fraud under this statute, and if the
complaint does not plead loss causation, it hasn't pled
fraud. So we submit that --
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not correct I don't
think. I think there could be a completely fraudulent
statement but no -- no damages as a result of it. There
would still be fraud.
MR. HUNGAR: Yes, but in a -- in a private
action for securities fraud, loss causation is an element
of the cause of action. It's not an element in every
fraud case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not an element of the
fraud. It's an element of the cause -- cause of action.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, it may be a semantic
question. That's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's what Justice
Ginsburg's point --
MR. HUNGAR: But there -- I mean, there are
cases in the -- in the courts of appeals saying that --
that rule 9(b) applies to all the elements, and we're not
aware of cases -- the -- the -- one of the amicus briefs
cites cases which focus on the nature of the
representation, and that's certainly where 9(b) issues are
generally fought out because in a -- in a typical
securities case, loss causation is not a difficult issue
because the -- the bad news is -- is announced, the stock
drops, and the plaintiff pleads loss causation as a matter
of course. It -- it's -- it's not a difficult burden to
satisfy in your run-of-the-mill securities case.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: In any event, the difference
between getting the -- the complaint dismissed on the
pleadings or having to wait for a -- a 12(b)(6) motion
because as soon as you, you know, ask for the -- the proof
of the elements of the cause of action, you're entitled to
have, if -- if your analysis of the case is correct,
you're entitled to have the drop in -- in the value of the
stock shown.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, as a -- as a practical
matter, Your Honor, there's a huge difference in how these
cases are litigated because it's the difference between
spending millions of dollars on discovery, literally
millions of dollars on discovery, or not. If -- if the
plaintiff has failed to allege loss causation and for some
reason feels unable to allege it, the -- the case is going
to be dismissed. If the court doesn't require loss
causation, as the Ninth Circuit did -- did here, that
means the case is going to go to discovery and the
defendant is going to have to either spend millions of
dollars on their own lawyers or spend millions of dollars
to settle even in a case that -- where the plaintiff might
be unable to establish loss causation. That's why --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is the --
MR. HUNGAR: -- Congress did what it did in
95.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is the reason -- is there a
further reason that they've got to -- to plead loss
causation? And that is, by reading (e)(2), in effect, as
-- as making -- as -- as saying that if you were going to
recover on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you in effect
have -- have got to prove your loss in a certain way. And
you're saying if you're going to -- if you're going to sue
on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you've got to allege all
the elements of fraud on the market. And if you allege
all the elements of fraud on the market, you're going to
allege exactly what you've just been saying is required.
So it's not so the -- I -- I guess what I'm --
I'm getting at is maybe what -- maybe the nub of the
answer is not necessarily that there's -- that there's
fraud involved, but there is a fraud-on-the-market theory
as the basis for the cause of action, and if that is the
basis, it's got to be disclosed in the pleadings as an
element.
MR. HUNGAR: I think that's -- that's a helpful
way to look at it, Justice Souter, because it's -- in --
in a fraud-on-the-market case, by definition the plaintiff
is alleging that there was an efficient national market
and that is what makes the difference. If this were the
-- you -- you buy a gold mine, like the -- the old common
law cases that respondents cite, there's no efficient
national market on which the -- the plaintiff can turn
around and sell it at the same price until the information
has been disclosed. But when it is an -- a national,
active stock market, the market continues to reflect the
inflation, and so -- so the plaintiff has not been
injured, and the allegation that it was an efficient
market and I bought it at an inflated price does not
support an inference of -- of injury. And the -- and so
because it is a fraud-on-the-market case, that's exactly
right. The additional information must be pled in the
complaint or else no injury has been -- been pled and the
complaint must be dismissed.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- do you take the
position that the phrase in (e)(2), if the plaintiff --
I'm sorry. Let me find it.
MR. HUNGAR: You're referring to section 12(b)
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm trying to find a
phrase in (e)(2).
If the plaintiff seeks to establish damages by
reference to the market price of a security, do you take
that phrase as -- as referring to a fraud-on-the-market
theory or as being broader than a fraud-on-the -- on-the-
market theory.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, I suppose a plaintiff in --
JUSTICE SOUTER: It certainly includes it.
There's no question about that. Does --
MR. HUNGAR: I think what that encompasses is a
-- is a case in which the plaintiff purchased the stock on
the market -- on -- on a open market, which will typically
be in practice a fraud-on-the-market case. I suppose a
plaintiff, in an unusual case, might not allege -- might
not choose to plead it as fraud-on-the-market case if they
have some specific evidence or reliance that they view is
stronger, but --
JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if it's not confined to
fraud-on-the-market, then there's the argument on the
other side that all -- all (2) is really doing is saying
that if you are going to establish your damages by
reference to market price, this is the way you've got to
do it. You've got to go through this mean price analysis
and so on. But they are saying we are not simply trying
to establish our damages by reference to the market, and
therefore we're not bound by -- and therefore, (e)(2), in
effect, is -- is irrelevant. What -- what is your
answer?
MR. HUNGAR: Well, I think they -- they
unquestionably are trying to establish their damages. The
Ninth Circuit's damage theory or -- or injury theory
establishes damages by reference to the market price.
JUSTICE SOUTER: To the -- to the purchase
price.
MR. HUNGAR: The plaintiffs alleged they
purchased at the market price in this fraud-on-the-market
case, and -- and the damages are the difference between
what they paid at that market price and what it should
have been. That is in our view an attempt to establish
damages by reference.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But they paid -- they paid
whether it was a market price or not. I mean --
MR. HUNGAR: Well, they -- they alleged they
purchased on the market. If -- if they weren't purchasing
on the market --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what they paid happens to
be the market price, but -- but you can't really say that
the Ninth Circuit was referring to the market price as
part of its -- its damages. Its damages are what they
paid. Whether that -- if they paid above market, it would
be the same.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, in any event, we interpret it
to refer to -- I mean, by definition they are, in a fraud-
on-the-market case, alleging that they have purchased at
the market price, and that's exactly what this statute
would be encompassing. But beyond that, as -- as Mr.
Sullivan identified, Congress' explanation of how it
understood loss causation, when it -- when it enacted
section 12(b) as part of the Reform Act, is entirely
consistent with our position, and the common law is
entirely consistent with our position.
Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.
Mr. Coughlin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK J. COUGHLIN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. COUGHLIN: Justice Stevens, may it please
the Court:
In answer to your question, Justice Kennedy,
yes, that's what -- exactly what we would do. We would go
back and replead, if we were required to do that, with
more specificity.
We don't think that (9)(b) applies in this
situation because both the Eleventh and the Third Circuits
have held that (9)(b) only applies to the circumstances
constituting fraud. It has never been applied to
materiality, loss causation, or damages.
JUSTICE BREYER: But surely they wanted to have
a person be able to read a complaint and just understand
what it's about in a securities fraud case. And I don't
see how you could understand it unless you have in the
complaint what your theory is. That's all. Nobody is
asking for some facts. Is your theory that the loss took
place at the time the person bought the stock because he
overpaid $30? Is your theory that the stock went down
and, because of that, he lost the money? Is your theory
that the stock didn't go down but it would have gone up
more? All they're asking is not for evidence, but a
simple, clear explanation of the theory, and plead in the
alternative if you want. But I mean, what's the problem?
Why is that so hard to do?
MR. COUGHLIN: I don't think that's so hard to
do. And you're right. We have to plead the theory, and
-- and the theory is --
JUSTICE BREYER: And this case doesn't seem to
do it. I looked through the entire complaint. I found
exactly two paragraphs. I didn't. My law clerk did,
frankly.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: But I told him to underline it.
In paragraph 179, he found the word, and it
caused damage. Okay? And in paragraph 177, it says the
same. That's all he could find. And they were harmed.
That's what it says.
MR. COUGHLIN: And -- and you're right, Your
Honor. There's not much in here. We plead the rises.
There are approximately seven rises. We plead the
purchases. We plead the big drop. Do we plead with
specificity? The -- the losses as to AlSpiros? No. We
could have done a better job.
Under the Ninth Circuit, though, the law, as we
pled it at the time, was that we have to plead an
inflation and identify the causes. And that's what we did
under Ninth Circuit law. If this Court were to decide
that we had to do more, could we? Certainly.
I mean, we have some of the information in
there. We -- we tie AlSpiros to the sales force, which is
an announcement on 2/24. You know, there's a lack of
integrity in management.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a -- but there --
there is a basic difference between, as was pointed out in
the colloquy with Mr. Hungar -- one thing is the
particularity of pleadings. Yes, you have to tell the
details of the fraud. No, you don't have to tell the
details of the loss. But you do have to have a theory on
which you can recover, and if your theory is simply I
bought at an inflated price and the law doesn't give you a
claim for relief on that theory, then you're out the
window. There's no discovery. There's nothing.
You have to have, as Justice Souter pointed out,
a viable theory of relief, and that's the difference
between -- you say it's enough that the stock was selling
for much more than it should have, and the other side
said, no, that's not enough. You have to show that when
the misrepresentation was corrected, the price dropped.
MR. COUGHLIN: Your Honor, I don't think it's
enough to prove that we just paid an overinflated price.
You cannot recover under Ninth Circuit law unless you not
only prove that you paid an inflated price, but also that
you prove that inflation came out.
I think where we differ from the Government and
petitioners is that it -- conceptually, at least with the
Government, the right framework is to analyze did the
inflation come out of the stock. And our quarrel here is
how can the inflation come out of the stock? Does there
have to be a corrective disclosure? And we say no. Time
itself can take inflation out of the stock.
Company-specific information is our biggest
concern. If somebody walks a stock down, so to speak,
they give out information lowering expectations because
stock prices are based on cash flow. If they walk it down
and say, hey, our -- we're going to have a revenue miss,
but they don't announce their problems with AlSpiros at
the time, or we're closing some factories, or we're taking
a significant write-off, that stock drops. We believe
that lowers inflation.
I think a good case to take a look at to
illustrate this is the Wool v. Tandem case out of the
Ninth Circuit. In that case, Tandem was shipping to its
own warehouses for 2 years, lying about its revenues.
Wool went out and bought the stock. The stock was
inflated. The Wall Street Journal, subsequent to that,
reported we don't see how Tandem can continue to book
these revenues, and then the company itself lowered
expectations in one of their SEC filings saying, hey,
lower than expected revenues coming up. The stock has
dropped and now Wool sells. And now then after that, it's
admitted that there was a fraud. Does -- and the stock
barely drops hardly at all because the expectations in
that stock have already been taken out.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? I don't understand. I
mean, there would be even more expectation taken out after
the fraud is announced. I mean, it's just like saying,
you know, besides -- besides fact that our CEO just died,
there's no gold there. Don't you think it would go down
still further?
MR. COUGHLIN: Maybe and maybe not much. It
depends on what's your cash in the bank. In this case,
they had gone to the market and gotten $400 million of
cash in the bank. So as the expectations were lowered
with the Ceclor CD sales here not once but twice and the
sales force inadequacy, before it was ever announced, they
knew when the FDA was coming out.
This is not the perfect situation. You're
right. We could have just taken this out and --
JUSTICE BREYER: But it sounds to me as if the
things you're saying now are matters for proof, and I -- I
think the wiggle room in the Government's position was it
said it has to be disclosed to the market in some form or
other. Well, if you're prepared to be broad and turn
those over to the experts for the proof, you end up with
your theory. The -- the inflation comes out and it comes
out because they didn't get the earnings that they would
have had or there may be many reasons.
MR. COUGHLIN: There's no doubt, Your Honor.
And if we have to do it at the pleading stage, it would be
impossible.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you just have to say at
the pleading stage what your theory is.
MR. COUGHLIN: And -- and I think we did that.
We said the stock was inflated and there was damage, and
we could have done a better job. Absolutely --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your theory was, at
least as I read your brief, that your loss occurs at the
moment of purchase, not at some later time, that when you
bought the stock, the price was inflated and that's when
you suffered your loss, on the day of the purchase, not at
a later time.
MR. COUGHLIN: That's absolutely correct. We
believe that you suffer your loss and damages on the date
you make the purchase. On the day --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you reconcile that with
your concession that if the person who -- who buys it at
an inflated price turns around 2 days later and sells it
at that same inflated price, he cannot bring suit? You
would not allow recovery in that situation.
MR. COUGHLIN: Would not allow recovery in
that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How -- how can you reconcile
that --
MR. COUGHLIN: Because those --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- with the notion that the
loss occurred at the time your purchased?
MR. COUGHLIN: Justice Scalia, because those are
-- what we're talking about are recoverable damages, and
then there's a limitation from section 28. In other
words, all the cause of action was satisfied on the date
you overpay. The day you pay $100 for a stock that's
worth $50, you're out the $50, the economy is out the $50
because it's not working -- it's working a fraudulent
market. But you cannot recover, we would agree, until
later.
And the problem with analyzing that at the
pleading stage is that is the -- that is expert analysis
and discovery to connect up how -- how the losses came out
and what you can recover. So I agree with you that you
cannot recover that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They're saying there's no
losses. I mean, that's -- it's inconsistent how the
losses come out. You just told us the loss occurs, bang,
when you buy it. You've gotten stock that really isn't
worth what you paid for it, the notion of -- of worth as
some -- you know, some objective thing rather than what --
what people are willing to pay.
MR. COUGHLIN: Well, that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's your theory and it
seems to me you're stuck with it. And if that theory is
true, then it shouldn't matter that you later sell it to
some other poor, unsuspecting individual for the same
amount you bought it for.
MR. COUGHLIN: It doesn't matter for that
plaintiff if they sell it to a poor -- somebody
unexpected. For example, Fannie Mae just publicly, a
couple of weeks ago, found out they bought $300 million
worth of bonds, and they -- they found out about a fraud.
They sold it and got fined by the Government because they
heard about the fraud and sold it back into the market to
recoup their losses or back through their broker. That's
-- that's not okay. That's just one outrageous example.
But somebody ends up with that stock that's
inflated. Okay? And when you make the purchase. We
agree we have to show the inflation come out before
recovery, and -- and 90 percent of the time --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to show what before
recovery? You have to show?
MR. COUGHLIN: The inflation came out of the
stock. In other words, if you pay $100 for a stock that's
worth $50, it's inflated by $50. You don't recover that
$50 until you show that $50 inflation came out of the
stock.
It can come out a number of ways. Let's say,
for example, that somebody announced a competitive
product. Well, that would take some of the inflation.
That would be a market factor that would take some of the
inflation out of your false statement that you had a
product, the AlSpiros product. There are different ways
inflation can come out besides a corrective disclosure.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but if you've got to show
the inflation, then you don't have a complete cause of
action the day after you buy the stock if there's no loss.
I mean, if you've got to show the -- the drop following
the inflation, you don't have the complete cause of action
if there's no drop the day after you buy the stock.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what they're saying.
MR. COUGHLIN: You can only recover --
JUSTICE SCALIA: To me your -- your --
MR. COUGHLIN: You can only recover if that
inflation is taken out of the stock. Those are
recoverable damages under Ninth Circuit law.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I -- I thought you were
conceding that you -- you, in fact, do not have a -- a
loss -- forget what you can recover -- that you don't have
a loss until the inflation is followed by a drop. And if
there's no drop at the -- at time of purchase plus 1
minute, then I don't see how there is even the element of
a cause of action.
MR. COUGHLIN: I -- I believe that the day you
overpay something, just like in the Sigafus, just in the
-- in the Bolles case, both of them had to do with gold
mines --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then you're talking about a
cause of action without damages.
MR. COUGHLIN: You may not have recoverable
damages. That is true.
JUSTICE SOUTER: If you have no damages, you
have no cause -- I mean, on normal tort theory, you have
no cause of action.
MR. COUGHLIN: I understand, and I think you
have $50 worth of damages right there. And our concern is
what you have to prove --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's exactly what
we're debating, I suppose, that very point. And -- and
it's hard to justify, under this statute, finding a cause
of action before there's any damage or if there isn't any.
That's -- that's just very hard to understand.
MR. COUGHLIN: In the most complex frauds, a --
a company is reporting revenue and earnings and their
stock is, let's say, trading at $60 a share. Perhaps,
because of fraud, it's overstated by $30. There are
people in the market buying that stock at $60. That
company starts to lower those expectations.
This happens to be a real world example,
Worldcom. They say we're going to miss revenues by $172
million. The stock starts dropping down. The inflation
that was in that stock because of what they lied about
starts coming out. Nobody knows there's fraud. Nobody
understands that. In fact, it's not until that stock goes
down at 80 cents that there was an admission of fraud.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But then you're not
saying what I think Justice Scalia and I actually thought
you were going to say which is that the minute he pays $60
for a stock that should be worth $30 but is $60 because of
the lie, at that instant he suffered a loss. After
listening to you, I now think you're saying -- but I'm not
sure because I've heard you say things that are -- both --
I now think you're saying, no, he has not suffered a loss
until later on when that $30 comes out of the price of the
stock.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's worrying me too.
JUSTICE BREYER: It might come out in many
different ways. It could come out because he announces
I'm a liar.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: It could come out because he
doesn't say anything but it sort of oozes out as earning
reports come in, but it has to come out.
Now, if you're saying that, then I find what
you're saying consistent what I think Judge Posner said.
And that's really what I'm interested in because I read
what he said. It seemed to me right. Now --
MR. COUGHLIN: I certainly don't want to be
disagreeing with Judge Posner. So I --
(Laughter.)
MR. COUGHLIN: The other --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think you're -- I
think you're agreeing with the petitioners. I think this
-- this whole thing is a great misunderstanding. You --
you didn't --
(Laughter.)
MR. COUGHLIN: I would agree with that, Your
Honor. That's just -- we come to the same conclusion.
There is no doubt about that. We come to the same
conclusion. We have to prove that that inflation was in
there when we prove it. And what we're talking about is
what the burden is going to be on us at the pleading, and
that's what we're concerned about.
JUSTICE BREYER: When we have this happy
agreement and if you'll agree, you at least have to prove
what you -- you have to plead what you intend to do, that
is, you have to plead and there was a loss and this is my
theory. I would like to know -- maybe we won't get beyond
this, but in looking at this, I wondered now suppose that
the stock goes up in value because of extraneous things.
Can you recover because it would have been still higher?
MR. COUGHLIN: Justice Breyer, I think the
Government says that we can recover. We believe that we
could recover. In other words, it didn't go up as high.
I think it is -- as Justice Ginsburg said, it's the same
difference. You lost $50 whether you lost it --
JUSTICE BREYER: What happens with the
transaction causation? Because I think you'd probably say
with your transaction causation in the -- in the case that
the -- that the lie wasn't there, we wouldn't have bought
the stock.
MR. COUGHLIN: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If you say that,
they come along and say, okay, you wouldn't have bought
the stock. I'll tell you, here's one bad thing happened.
You lost your $30. But there were six good things that
happened that you never thought of, and so the stocks were
four times what it would have been and you'd never have
those gains, just as you'd never have the losses. How
does that factor?
MR. COUGHLIN: Well, I dream to have those
clients that gain four times, but since we don't usually
have those and it is the drops that we're really talking
about. The but-for transaction, when they say, hey, and
-- and you buy it, and then it goes up, and then you learn
about the fraud -- and I'm assuming that there's no drop
but you can prove that the inflation was there and never
came out, and can you prove that it should have gone to
$250? You know? I'd have to prove that it went to $250.
I agree with you. You know, I would agree with you that,
you know, that I'd get an expert. Mr. Fischel would come
in and testify that it should have been worth $250. And
that's what, you know, would happen.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a problem. Take
the concrete facts of this case. The bad news about --
what is it? Albuterol?
MR. COUGHLIN: AlSpiros.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. That bad news didn't
come out until 9 months after the end of the period that
you identify for your class. You say the class is April
th, '97 until February 24th, '98 purchases. The bad
news doesn't come out until November of '98. So how could
you possibly hook up your loss to the news that comes out
later?
MR. COUGHLIN: If -- if we move to the proof
stage, the people that purchased in the class period and
sold before that announcement will not be able to recover
that 20 cent drop at the end. People who purchased during
the class period and held until all of the inflation was
taken out by either final announcement from the FDA or
when they announced they were abandoning the product would
be able to recover from that inflation because all of the
inflation was taken out as to AlSpiros.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I thought that you were
trying to pick up on the drop that seemed to be
attributable to the other --
MR. COUGHLIN: Product, Ceclor?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, and that's what -- well,
there -- there are two frauds going on. The first one is
discovered and the price drops substantially. And I
thought you were trying to attribute that drop to the
other product.
MR. COUGHLIN: There -- there are some things in
that drop attributable to the other product. The sales
force insufficiency, as well as management integrity, and
there are some other things that weren't pleaded well.
First of all, we were being conservative when we
pled this and we pled the rises. We pled the insider
sales. We pled the stock offerings. And all the
statements were in that earlier period. They make the
announcement. The stock starts down, 50 percent drop.
It's walked down another 40 percent after that. Finally,
you get the FDA announcement.
And we certainly could have, and -- and maybe
should have, taken that period out right then. The
district court ended up having problems with it. The
Ninth Circuit, in their questionings -- Judge Reinhardt
had problems with the -- with that. And they gave us
leave to replead, and we told them at that time if that's
what we need to do, is tie that in also, if that's a loss
that we intend to recover for or seek recovery for, then
we'll do that and we'll go back to replead. If there are
statute of limitations, that's a different issue, but we
can plead that and could have.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, one of the problems for
me is the Ninth Circuit seems to think that it has a
theory -- and it is the theory of your complaint -- that's
different from, say, the Third Circuit. The Ninth Circuit
says we recognize that the loss is you bought it at an
inflated price, and the Ninth Circuit thinks that's
different from a circuit that says you don't have any loss
until somehow the bad news comes out and there's a drop in
price as a result.
MR. COUGHLIN: I wish that the circuit said if
the bad news came out, but the Koger case and -- and
emergent out of the Second Circuit seem a little stronger
and talk about almost the only way it can happen is with a
corrective disclosure. And that's -- and that's a concern
of ours.
The Ninth Circuit law is pretty clear, is very
clear actually, with the three cases, Blackie, Green,
Judge Sneed in the Green v. Occidental case, and the Wool
case, saying that the loss occurs at the time of purchase
and overpayment, but recoverable damages --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that may be clear but
it may be clearly wrong.
(Laughter.)
MR. COUGHLIN: That -- it -- it -- I understand
that, Your Honor. I'm hoping that it's not clearly wrong.
It's been on the books for 30 years. It was the law. It
was the law on the books at the time that this was
codified. There was no real or perceived conflict in the
circuits at the time this was codified.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I thought that
Judge Sneed recognized that if the stock was sold before
any loss was incurred, even if there's been a
misrepresentation, recovery should be denied.
MR. COUGHLIN: That's correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.
MR. COUGHLIN: That's absolutely correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not what the Ninth
Circuit said in this case.
MR. COUGHLIN: The Ninth Circuit didn't -- it
cited -- it cited the Green v. Occidental opinion and the
Blackie I believe.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm submitting it cited it
for the wrong conclusion.
MR. COUGHLIN: I -- I think it -- I think it --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It cited -- I thought cited
Knapp and -- which, in turn, cited Gray or -- or --
MR. COUGHLIN: There are all the appendants.
There's -- there's the three that started off. Knapp is
the ATV case that we tried, and that was Judge Wallace and
he relied on Gray. All of them are the same in that you
have to -- to get by the pleading stage, that you have to
plead the inflation and identify the causes for it. It's
for proof and expert testimony and discovery to see if you
have recoverable damages.
If this Court were to say, no, we want
identifiable drops, then we could do that. You know, if
this Court were to say, listen, you've got to identify the
drops, whether they -- whether you can connect them up to
the fraud at this time, we want a full theory in the
complaint -- and we can do that. If that's what the -- if
that's what this Court directs us to do, then we'll do
that and we'll put in all the losses, as well as the
rises, as well as identifying the causes. You know, we'll
do that in -- in the complaints.
Sometimes what -- what we're saying and where we
differ a little bit from the Government is it's hard to
necessarily tie one of those innocuous disclosures that
may be taking the inflation out back to the
misrepresentation, and yet the stock is dropping and
inflation is coming out. And that's what we're worried
about. And there are other market forces that may take it
out. So at the pleading stage, we're worried about the
burden that almost puts us in -- in the position of having
an expert come in, and we think that's for a later time
for summary judgment or trial.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if you're worried about
it, why aren't you worried about it later, as well as
earlier? I mean, if that's going to be a problem, we
should know it sooner rather than later, rather than --
you know. If you say that's terribly difficult to prove,
we can hardly ever prove it, well, good. Then let's get
rid of this -- rid of the case earlier.
MR. COUGHLIN: I don't think I said --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't know why --
why it's desirable not to include that at the pleading
stage.
MR. COUGHLIN: I don't think I said that that
was difficult or hard to prove. I said it was difficult
or hard to plead. It is difficult and hard to plead, and
-- and to tie that -- those inflationary things back up
because you only get to recover -- you only get to recover
for things that took the inflation out. I mean, if the
stock drops -- let's say -- let's say the stock drops $60
or $50, and where he paid $60, it drops down to $10. But
half of that -- half of that drop is unrelated to the
fraud absolutely. Well, under a 10(b) cause of action,
you don't get to recover for that market loss. We have to
tie -- that's why Judge Sneed in Occidental -- in Green v.
Occidental tied it right to the overpayment because Judge
Sneed was worried about -- about the issuers being
insurers for the market.
In other words, if the stock -- if -- if a down
market takes the stock way past what you paid over
inflation, defendants should not be liable for the whole
market loss as they might in a section 33 case. And
that's really what the -- what the point is, to fix the
loss.
That's why Judge Sneed fixed the loss at the
date of overpayment because Judge Sneed didn't want
somebody coming in and saying, hey, you paid $60 for a
stock that was really worth $30. When you brought suit,
the stock was down at $10. Do you get to pay -- do you
get $50? And Judge Sneed said no. You only get the
overpayment on the date.
Admittedly in up or down markets, what
petitioners and the Government would suggest might move
the damages up or down. In an up market -- you know,
we're talking about something that was going down here.
In an up market, you might get a bigger drop.
JUSTICE BREYER: But that's a --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That's why the term loss
causation is used because under the statute it's -- it's a
loss experienced by the plaintiff caused by the
misrepresentation.
MR. COUGHLIN: Justice O'Connor, I -- I couldn't
agree more, and that's why it goes to proof. It says this
is a proof statute --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No.
MR. COUGHLIN: I agree. It has to be alleged.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The Government said you don't
want unnecessary discovery. You have to put out pleadings
that make clear what your theory is --
MR. COUGHLIN: There's no doubt.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- which yours don't do.
MR. COUGHLIN: They don't do well enough in this
case.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but what -- it seems to me
that what Judge Sneed's theory boils down to is this. You
cannot recover any loss except the loss that was caused by
the fraud in question. In theory, that limit is
established by the inflation at the time you purchase. So
that is the limit of your recovery, but it does not follow
from that that you have anything to recover for until you
have your actual loss if you're pleading a -- a fraud-on-
the-market theory. Isn't that fair to say?
MR. COUGHLIN: That's fair to say.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. COUGHLIN: I agree with that, Your Honor.
That is -- that's exactly what -- that's exactly what
Judge Sneed did. And when we were talking about this
statute here, it talks about us proving those -- that loss
causation and tying it to the actual omissions.
And it follows two sections that deal with
pleading, material -- deal with particularized pleading as
to falsity and as to scienter. And this statute says that
if you don't plead one or two with the particularity
required, then the complaint shall be dismissed.
This section here --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so -- I'm not sure I
understand what -- I'm -- I'm really coming to believe
that this is a misunderstanding. It seems to me you're
now saying that the loss does not occur when you make the
purchase. It is just that that is the limit on your loss,
the difference between what the stock would have cost you
had the -- the absence of gold been known and what you
actually paid.
MR. COUGHLIN: It's the limit on your loss.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that is not your loss.
You're saying now the loss has to occur later when the
price goes down and you're thereby harmed. Is that it?
MR. COUGHLIN: No. I apologize if I haven't
been clear. The loss occurs at the time you purchase, but
you cannot recover any portion of the loss until the
inflation is taken out.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- let's approach it a
different way. On a fraud-on-the-market theory, there are
two facts I think that can be assumed. Number one, there
was no misrepresentation that was made peculiarly to you.
The misrepresentation was to the broad market and was
reflected in the broad market price.
MR. COUGHLIN: Correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Number two, you as a purchaser
do not know about the fraud until the market finds out
about the fraud.
MR. COUGHLIN: Correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: If that is the case, then I
don't see that it makes any sense at all to talk about
your having a cause of action the day after you purchase
before the market has found out and before the fraud is
known. I mean, this -- this strikes me as an exercise in
-- in an inconsistent theory.
MR. COUGHLIN: And here's why it matters, if I
might, is that what petitioners and perhaps the Government
would say is that you're right. You don't find out about
the fraud until the whole market finds out. But before
you find out about the fraud, there can be terrific drops
in the stock, which we think we could prove are related to
the fraud. Okay? Because we've had certainly a market
loss to what we paid. The stock has dropped down. We
don't know about fraud yet. All of a sudden, there's a
disclosure of fraud, and we all learn about it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know about it, but
the market knows about it. That's -- that's why the stock
has gone down.
MR. COUGHLIN: Not necessarily, Your Honor. In
other words, you can lower expectations by lower revenue
numbers. Other market forces like a competitor coming out
with a product. There are other things that can lower
that. I'm sorry. And when it gets down there, the rule
that we fear is being urged is that you only get the drop
from either the admission of the fraud or the full
disclosure of the fraud, and in the complex cases, the
Enrons, the Worldcoms, the Healthsouths of the world, that
didn't happen even until long after they were in
bankruptcy. And if we only get the drop, the $3 drop at
the end, or the 80 cents to 50 cents that the Government
just returned $750 million to in the Worldcom, with every
large institution in the country already out of that
stock, well, then those that were sought to be protected
by the Reform Act aren't.
We have to be able to plead certainly -- and --
and we can -- the -- the market moving down. And then
that's at the pleading stage, a plain 8(a) statement. And
then we have to prove and tie that back up to get damages.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that's what
the Government was getting at in the passage I read
earlier where they don't make it -- there must be a
statement by the issuer of the correction. They have more
leeway.
But you -- the Ninth Circuit -- the litany that
it's using, the -- the set of cases -- for example,
plaintiffs were harmed when they paid more for the stock
than it was worth. The -- the notion that's repeated,
that your loss is established on the day you purchase the
price, that's just wrong, and I think we would have to at
a minimum say that.
MR. COUGHLIN: I -- I don't agree with that,
Your Honor. I agree with the Ninth Circuit that you
suffer the loss of overpayment. You have something in
your hand that's worth half as much as its true value.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you seem --
MR. COUGHLIN: Can you recover? Is it like the
UCC where you've got to mitigate your damages? You cannot
recover those damages even though you've suffered them.
You have a stock certificate that's worth half of what
it's worth even in an efficient market. And when the
truth comes out, that's true, you'll be damaged, and if
you sell it before then, you get no recovery.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But aren't -- aren't you --
aren't you, in -- in effect, equating two different
things: one, a loss that you suffer which you say occurs
immediately upon purchase of the inflated stock; and on
the other hand, a limit on the loss that is attributable
to the fraud? Those are two different things. I
understand the limit on the loss. I don't understand the
-- the suffering of the loss in fact.
MR. COUGHLIN: Well, Your Honor, I think that
that's an interesting statement because if the limit is --
let's say for a $100 stock that's worth $50 and you
overpay by $50, let's say that's the limit of our loss,
even if the stock --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. -- Mr. Coughlin, I'm
afraid you've had a full opportunity to explain this very
difficult case. You'll have to -- your time is up.
MR. COUGHLIN: Thank you, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Sullivan, you have 2
minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. SULLIVAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, and may it
please the Court:
One point I think I want to focus upon for the
-- for the Court is -- is the comment in the Senate report
which said that the damages had to be a result of the
cause -- the -- the misrepresentation, not other factors.
I think what we've just heard about, in terms of the
decline in the market value, is -- is a look at a number
of the other factors. And there are disclosures that are
related to fraud and there are disclosures that are not
related to fraud. And if there was a misrepresentation in
the marketplace, that -- that is one thing. If a new
competitor comes out with a new product, that's not --
JUSTICE BREYER: What's the problem here? He --
I mean, well, you heard what he said. And it sounded to
me that he agrees with you he has to prove that in fact
the fraud not only led to the overpayment, but that also
later on the client who bought the stock lost money
because the market went down, and that default, which cost
him the money, is caused by the fraud.
MR. SULLIVAN: And -- and --
JUSTICE BREYER: When it comes out, it just
comes out in subtle ways as well as direct ways.
Now, do you agree with that? If they -- if you
do, it seems to me there's no case here.
MR. SULLIVAN: I would -- I would agree with you
and -- and I would just --
JUSTICE BREYER: Where do you disagree?
MR. SULLIVAN: -- I would just add -- I don't
disagree. I would add that the cause is not by other
factors because I think when we heard the discussion about
the -- the reduction of inflation, we were hearing about
factors other than that.
I just want to close by saying the loss
causation codification in the Reform Act was meaningful
and was part of the Reform Act. And that really indicates
that this is a pleading standard that we -- we -- we're
dealing with, that the cause of action for a securities
fraud has to be stated at the time. And that's consistent
with what the Reform Act was trying to achieve which is to
give the defendants a chance to respond and actually have
the motion to dismiss serve as a meaningful screen in
dealing with those cases.
Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.
The case is submitted.
