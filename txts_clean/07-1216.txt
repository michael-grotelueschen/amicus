CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Williams.
Mr. Shapiro.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
We are here today because the Oregon court
failed to follow this Court's directions on remand and
because the ground it gave is not adequate to show a
forfeiture of due process rights.
This -- this Court vacated after finding
that the Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong
constitutional standard, and it remanded with directions
to apply the standard that the Court laid out. But the
Oregon court didn't do that. It never even addressed
the constitutional issue. The Oregon court, of course,
refused to follow this Court's direction because it
believed there were mistakes in another paragraph in our
instruction request dealing with what the court referred
to as "unrelated issues."
But that isn't what this Court mandated.
And the specific forfeiture theory adopted here for the
first time after nine years of appellate litigation is
completely inadequate to avoid this mandate.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, we are
dealing with a State supreme court, and our bottom line
always reads "for further proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion." And it was my understanding that a
State court can resolve a case on an alternate State law
ground, if there is such a ground in the case.
MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, Your Honor. We believe
that this disposition is quite inconsistent with what
the Court mandated. The Court heard arguments in this
case about the "correct in all respects" rule, but it
still mandated an application of the constitutional
standard, including the prohibition on punishment for
harm to non-parties, and that standard simply was never
applied. We say that is inconsistent with this Court's
opinion.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But it seems to me the
problem with the argument is that to say it is
inconsistent with the opinion we implicitly have to say
that the Oregon Supreme Court has to confront State law
issues in a certain sequence, and that if it does not do
so those issues are waived, as it were, not only by the
court but by the party who raised it. And the
difficulty, I think, with your position here is that on
the assumption, which I do make, that the -- that the
issue, "correct in all respect" issue, was properly
raised by the other side, if we accept your position, we
in effect are saying the other side is not going to have
an opportunity to argue that before the Oregon Supreme
Court. And that's, it seems to me, kind of a steep hill
for you to climb.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, we don't say that the
court can never adopt a State law standard after remand
from this Court, but we say that this disposition is
inconsistent --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I know you are saying that
but why -- why does the disposition that you are asking
for not entail what I just said, and that is, in effect
you cut off the claim by a party raised before the
Oregon Supreme Court, not considered by the Oregon
Supreme Court, and you cut off that claim simply because
the Oregon Supreme Court chose to approach the issues in
the case in a certain sequence? What business do we
have to do that?
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, because the preservation
issue was debated before this Court and it adopted a
specific order here saying on remand now consider the
constitutional standard, which is the prohibition on --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I know the language that
you are referring to.
MR. SHAPIRO: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But the referring to that
language simply skips over the issue that I am trying to
raise. Isn't there a problem that we should be
concerned with if we accept your position in cutting off
the claim made by one party to the case which was never
heard by the Oregon Supreme Court?
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, this is very
similar to what occurred in the Sullivan case in this
Court, where the issue of preservation was debated
before this Court at the cert stage in the cert papers,
and the Court said: We sub silentio passed on the
adequacy of the State ground when we CDRed the case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't -- did the
Court -- suppose the -- what is it called -- "correct in
all respects" had been raised and decided by the Oregon
Supreme Court in the first instance. Suppose it had
said, well, we don't have to deal with whether
Instruction 34 was right or wrong in this particular,
because it was wrong in other respects. Suppose that
had been the first time around what the Oregon Supreme
Court said. Would that have offended any Federal due
process? Would that have been an appropriate
--
disposition for the Oregon Supreme Court to make?
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, that takes us to our
second and principal argument, which is that that ground
would not be adequate under this Court's criteria for
adequacy. And we say that there are really three
reasons why that would not be an adequate ground for
forfeiting this constitutional right. It's an ambush.
It was a surprise ruling that we couldn't anticipate.
It is an exercise in futility because, even if we
submitted a perfect instruction that complied with that
rule, we would have been rejected anyway by the trial
court that simply believed that this instruction wasn't
required by the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the place to make
that argument in the Oregon Supreme Court?
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, no. The Oregon Supreme
JUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't it have been
appropriate to -- to hear the -- the issue that they are
raising and for you to make the reply that you have just
made?
MR. SHAPIRO: Your Honor, this Court has
said repeatedly that adequacy is a Federal law question
for this Court to decide.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I realize it's a Federal
law question and in approaching that question, I keep
asking the question which I think I have now put to you
three times and have yet to hear an answer on the merits
on: Why is it appropriate for us to have a rule here
that cuts off the right of a party that properly raised
an issue in the Oregon Supreme Court and has yet to be
heard on the merits in the Oregon Supreme Court?
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, there are two reasons.
First under the adequacy decisions of this Court,
including Lee v. Kemna, if it takes years and years
after the trial to articulate a forfeiture rule like
this that counts heavily against the adequacy of the
State ground. This Court held that in Lee v. Kemna very
recently.
And then secondly, this is a point that was
argued to this Court four separate times now and when
the Court remanded with explicit directions to apply the
constitutional standard that's something that had to be
done on remand. The Court did not invite the lower
court to get into the question of whether this request
was made. The Court found that the request was made.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe -- maybe this Court
insufficiently appreciated the significance of the issue
which is now before us. And I still want to know, is
there a good reason on the merits why it is fair for us
to cut off the right of the other side to raise an issue
that they raise or to argue an issue that they raised in
a timely fashion?
MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, there is a good reason,
because this is -- adequacy is ultimately a Federal
question for this Court to decide. The issue was
debated here four separate times at great length. The
Court remanded for a specific decision by the lower
court. That wasn't done. And if we turn to the
adequacy doctrine --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What -- what
issue was debated here four times?
MR. SHAPIRO: Whether or not there was an
adequate State ground because of the "correct in all
respects" rule. That was debated in the merits brief,
in the cert oppositions twice. It was debated again in
the cert opposition this time around. But the Court has
never accepted it.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the State court hadn't
ruled on it at that time.
MR. SHAPIRO: That's correct.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So how do we rule on it as
a matter of first impression?
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, because, Your Honor, the
Court considered, just as it did in Sullivan, it
considered these issues in the cert papers and then
remanded the case for a different issue to be decided by
the lower court.
But we don't hesitate from debating the
adequacy issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Did our opinion decide that
-- that question? Did our opinion say that that
question was decided against your opponent?
MR. SHAPIRO: No. What the Court said in
Sullivan was that it was a sub silentio determination.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could we have
determined it when the Oregon Supreme Court itself
hadn't made any determination?
MR. SHAPIRO: Because the parties debated
this extensively in their briefs.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we don't decide
questions, particularly questions of State law, that may
have a Federal check. But we don't decide them in the
first instance.
And there's one point, Mr. Shapiro, that I
think affects this concern of fairness to the parties
who raised this "correct in all respects" from the
beginning. This Court had not clarified, had it, until
the Williams case itself, the rule about harm to others.
In State Farm we were talking about harm to
nonresidents. So if I recall correctly, Williams was
the first time we ever clarified that harm to others
included people within the same State; is that correct?
MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. That's true.
This -- this, as the Court expressed it, was
a slight extension of the previous decisions.  But Your
Honor, if the Court feel that this adequacy issue hasn't
been dealt with previously by this Court, it's presented
squarely here. It is a Federal question, which this
Court says has to be decided by this Court. And we
don't hesitate from --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose one reason
-- one reason to think it may not have been decided is
that, unlike the other situations you have discussed, it
would not have been a bar to our consideration of this
case the last time because, just as you raise the
question in your second question presented that whether
the award complies with due process, we may have thought
there might have been an adequate and independent State
ground on a procedural question, but we were going to go
ahead. We granted cert on the substantive question on
whether the damages award was unconstitutional.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, if -- if
we're not right about the decision resolving the
adequacy issue already, we're happy to turn to it now
--
and address it as we do in our briefs. This is not an
adequate State ground under this Court's decisions. The
first reason for that is that this is a futile gesture
that the State court requires of us.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I want to ask you about
that. That's the thrust of your argument: It would
have been futile to comply with the specific, drafting a
perfect -- perfect instruction "correct in all
respects." But I have to think the trial -- the record
is subject to the reading that the trial judge thought
the issue had already been adequately taken care of,
rather than it would be an incorrect instruction.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, the trial judge asked,
is there any authority that requires me to give this
instruction on harm to non-parties? And we said, in our
view it's the BMW case. And she said, well, if there is
not an authority right on point I'm not going to give
this instruction. She said that very clearly. So if we
submitted a separate piece of paper, it would have made
no difference; and if we had taken out the two mistakes
JUSTICE STEVENS: Where in the record is the
portion of the colloquy about the instructions most
clearly stated in your view, on your side of that issue?
MR. SHAPIRO: Let's see. It's the
instruction conference. This begins on page 17a, where
Mr. Beaty starts discussing the second prong of this
paragraph. He says -- he quotes the language, and the
judge -- the judge says: "Well, I think that that's
covered by giving an instruction that punitive damages
are not compensatory." And he says: No, no, that is
not -- "That is not the point of this instruction."
This is pages 17 and 18a.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's exactly the
point I make. I think the trial judge was saying, I
think it's already covered, which is different from
saying, no matter how you phrase it, I won't give it.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, she said she just
disagreed with the idea that there should be protection
against punishment for harm to non-parties. And she
said unless there's a case requiring that, I'm not going
to give that instruction. And she said --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Didn't she also say that
she was going to give, and ultimately did give an
instruction, to the effect that punitive damages are
punitive, they are not for the compensation of this
person or any other person, and to -- she then turned to
Philip Morris's counsel and said: What about that? And
Philip Morris's counsel said okay.
MR. SHAPIRO: What he was saying when he
said okay was: I understand your ruling and I'm not
going to continue to argue a point that I've already
lost. But he pressed that point --
JUSTICE SOUTER: It doesn't sound like much
of an objection.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, the -- the State courts
both held -- both of the appellate courts held our
instruction was rejected. And this Court said it was
rejected, too, in its opinion. And that's exactly
right. You can't antagonize the trial judge by arguing
and arguing after your position has been rejected.
JUSTICE BREYER: But -- but the -- the
problem that I am having at the moment is that they did
-- from your point of view, is that they -- the other
side listed 28 cases in which they said the Oregon
courts have followed this rule that the instruction has
to be good as a whole.
Now, I have looked up those 28 cases, and
they do -- they do say that. They do say it, or they
imply it, or they apply it. They are not completely on
point, but they are not completely out of point, either.
And -- and so I suppose what happened is that the judge
there just looked at this instruction on 32(a). It
looks like sort of it's all together. It really does
look like it's all together, the (1) and the (2). And
he ran his eye down the page and he said, well, here are
two other ways in which it's no good, and so that's the
end of it. You can't raise your objection. Maybe you
should have had four instructions instead of one, but
you did just have one.
And under Oregon law, unless every part of
it is right, the judge is correct in not giving it, even
if he never mentions the other part. And that 28 -- it
does seem as if that's what those 28 cases do say. So
what do we say about that?
MR. SHAPIRO: The -- the reason we say that
those 28 cases did not give us reasonable notice that we
had to submit a separate piece of paper or change
another paragraph in the instruction request is that
none of them dealt with a situation where you have
separately numbered requests --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean -- please, I
-- I don't want to appear skeptical, but I am. And --
and that's because I have looked up in some of those
cases, and then I sort of looked at the -- which doesn't
-- most of them don't give you the instructions, so it's
a little hard to say. But then I looked on page 32(a)
of this appendix and looked at what your instructions
looked like.
And -- and if I were sitting there as a
judge, I would think, well, gee, that looks like a
single thing there. They have it indented, and they
have a (1) and a (2), and it just looks like it's one
ball of wax. So can I really fault this Oregon court
for just doing what I said?
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I -- I think so, because
the pattern instruction here told both parties to
include all their paragraphs pertaining to punitive
damages in one numbered instruction, 34.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, they had some other
handbook that says beware of that.
MR. SHAPIRO: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Because you are going to
run into this rule that says if there is any part of a
single instruction that is wrong, goodbye, even if the
trial judge never mentioned it.
MR. SHAPIRO: But that handbook came out in
06. And after all, that was a practice tip. It was
not a State court ruling saying you had to organize your
instruction this way.
We had separate paragraphs, separately
numbered. They dealt with different issues. One was
the Constitution and the other was the State statute.
And there's no Oregon case that said that in that
situation you have to break it out into a separate piece
of paper.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the notion was
one issue, one charge. And it wasn't in just one
practice manual. There were a few cited in the brief
that the charge should be limited to one issue, one
point of law.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, the pattern instructions
told us to put every point pertaining to punitive
damages in Instruction No. 34. Both sides did that.
And the Court was working with plaintiff's instruction,
taking their --
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it would be pretty
odd. Did the person who wrote that read these 28 cases
or some share thereof? And if you were going to do that
-- it wasn't you, I know -- why -- why wouldn't you
just, if you have one instruction, copy the -- the model
instruction? Then you won't make errors in the other
parts.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, you see, the -- the
pattern -- the pattern instruction didn't include the
due process point.
JUSTICE BREYER: True, but you could add
that to the pattern.
MR. SHAPIRO: That's what we tried to do,
and the -- the judge invited us while dealing with the
other side's instruction to go through this one by one.
She -- she was asking us: Now, what's your next
addition?
And we -- we got to the due process point,
and she said: What is your authority? And we told her,
and she said: I don't think that instruction is
necessary.
It was separately argued. It was separately
decided by the State courts in the prior decisions,
decided by this Court as -- as a separate matter, and
that is exactly how the trial court approached this.
Her request was to go through this item by item.
She wasn't taking an all-or-nothing approach
to this instruction. She started with plaintiff's
document and asked what from our menu of additions
was necessary.
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not speaking of this
from the point of view -- I mean I -- when I read that
petition for cert, I thought this is a run- around, and
I'm not sure that I think that now. That is, the reason
is because I put myself in the position of not the trial
judge. The person to put yourself in the position of is
the Oregon Supreme Court justice. And what he is doing
is he's reading that instruction. And -- and what can
you say in response to what -- what he might have
thought?
He knows this rule. The rule is if the
instruction is -- is unfavorable in any part, if it's
wrong, you are out.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: He knows that rule, because
there have been a lot of cases on it. And then he reads
your instruction, and as I looked carefully -- I didn't
know this the first time when it was here, but he said
because it's right in paragraph 1 -- I mean it's wrong
in paragraph 1, where he was wrong -- I don't have to go
to the rest of it.
MR. SHAPIRO: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now we send it back, so he
says: Okay, now I've got to go to the rest of it.
MR. SHAPIRO: You know, Justice Breyer, this
is very similar to what was at issue in the Flowers case
which reached this Court. The Alabama Supreme Court had
said if you intermix different appeal points in your
brief, we are not going to consider any of them if there
are any errors to be found in any of the paragraphs in
their brief.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought the whole
thing about -- this is the NAACP case you that you were
discussing?
MR. SHAPIRO: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that this was
something that the Alabama Supreme Court really sprung
at the last minute, that it was not like this rule.
There were not 28 cases in the Alabama Supreme Court
applying the rule. It seemed to be quite a novel rule.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, what -- what the State
argued there was that for 60 years the "correct in all
respects" rule was in effect in Alabama, and they cited
dozens of cases applying it. But this Court unanimously
held that that approach was pointless severity. Even
though the State supreme court there said, we can't
disentangle these arguments, it's too complicated, it's
too much of a burden on the State supreme court, this
Court unanimously found that was pointless severity.
And at that point --
JUSTICE STEVENS: There was a basis for
questioning the good faith of the court in that case, I
think.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And I don't think that's
true here.
MR. SHAPIRO: I -- I -- we don't question
the good faith of the court, but we say that this is
pointless severity, a rule that this Court has applied
more recently in Lee v. Kemna where there was no issue
of bad faith. The Court thought that it was pointlessly
severe and unnecessarily severe to insist on a perfect
proposal in that case.
JUSTICE BREYER: The best you have come up
with -- and I think you have researched this pretty
thoroughly -- and the best you have come up with to find
a case where they didn't apply the rule is that George
case, right? "George," I think, is the name of it.
And there, there is an alternative ground
which is that the judge had to -- had to give the
instruction himself, and it's a criminal case. And we
Shepardized it and it has only been cited twice. And --
and so I'm slightly at sea, to tell you the truth. And
-- and what is the standard I'm supposed to use to
decide whether that State ground is adequate as a matter
of Federal law or not?
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, there is an earlier case
that is interesting, State v. Brown, which comes several
years before, and it's cited in our brief. In that case
an imperfect instructional request was made, and the
Court still found that there was a duty to give the
instruction based on due process. And the reason was
that the parties during the charge conference had
debated the issue. It was a fair-enough exposition for
the trial court to understand the need for the charge.
And here this really is much like the
Osborne case. You know, in the Osborne case the
defendant didn't make any instructional proposal, and
this Court still reversed and required a new trial with
the correct instruction. It said due process required
that. And the Court said that we -- that the party had
sufficiently brought this to the attention of the trial
judge for Federal adequacy purposes even though no
instruction was -- was proposed.
The lawyer there merely moved to dismiss the
proceeding, never proposed an instruction, but this
Court required a retrial with a correct set of
instructions to the jury. That's an a fortiori case, I
think; and also the Flowers case, I believe, is a
fortiori. There really was a strong and compelling
State interest there in having the lawyers break their
arguments up into separate headings and subheadings so
the appellate court could follow the argument.
But here there wasn't any burden placed on
the trial judge at all by our request. She was going
through these one by one, and she asked us: What's your
next point that you want added? We proposed it. It was
on a silver platter. She didn't have to retype it. She
could have simply read it to the jury in that form. It
didn't have to be edited or amended. There literally
was no burden on the trial judge at all. And so we --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: She didn't get to the --
the other grounds, because I think it was all about that
paragraph and whether that paragraph was adequate under
our then precedent. And I don't think that -- that the
-- the incorrect portions of the charge that have now --
are now before us were -- were even reached then.
MR. SHAPIRO: She did look at the illicit
profits point. And she said: I'm not going to give
that; that's unnecessary. She did -- she didn't address
the "may versus shall" issue because she was working
with plaintiffs' proposal. So all -- really she just
had before her our request for this due process
instruction. She analyzed it separately, it was debated
before her.
And this is much more specific than what the
lawyers did in the Osborne case. They didn't even
propose an instruction. We served it up on a silver
platter. She could have used it, and indeed there was
no work for the trial judge at all because she was
simply telling the lawyers, make this change, make that
change that we've discussed, so there is zero burden on
the court.
And you have to ask in this situation, what
is the legitimate State interest that would support this
massive forfeiture of a very important due process
right? The plaintiff says the State interest here is
that it promotes affirmance of jury verdicts whether or
not there has been a due process violation. But think
about that. That's hardly a State interest.
JUSTICE BREYER: The State interest in the
rule in general, I take it, is to require the lawyers,
if they are going to object to the instructions that the
judge is going to give, to produce an instruction that
is a correct instruction of the law. That's -- that's
why, I guess, they have this rule.
MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and you'd better get
it right, because if you don't get it right, you're
going to lose your ability to claim that the judge was
wrong in refusing to give any part of it.
Now, if that's the reason they have that
rule, that would seem to apply as much in this case as
in any other case. Why wouldn't it?
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, please recall that in
both Osborne and in the Lee case, there was a general
State purpose of that kind that supported the rule, but
the Court said it was an exorbitant or unnecessarily
severe application of the rule. And that's what we
contend here, that this is exorbitant, it serves no
legitimate purpose. It is truly a game of gotcha that
just nullifies the defendant's due process rights.
And that precedent I think would be of great
concern in various fields of law. This is a rule of law
that will apply in civil rights cases in the future,
criminal cases, all sorts of cases.
So I -- I think if this Court does apply its
own criteria here, it will see that this is an exercise
in futility, it was an ambush as a practical matter. We
didn't have any reason to think we had to submit this
again on a separate piece of paper.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Could you just tell me,
well, why was it an exercise in futility? That's what I
don't quite understand.
MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, because the judge had
ruled as a matter of substantive law that she wasn't
going to give this instruction. It wouldn't matter if
we separated it.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But she said she thought
it was already covered. That's what I -- on that very
page you pointed me to.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, she -- she said that was
all she was going to say about the point. And we said,
well, that doesn't cover our point, because we want
protection against punishment for harm to non-parties.
And she said: I'm not going to give that instruction; I
deny the rest of your request, No. 34.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And where is this
colloquy? I mean, we went through the parts, she said I
think it's covered and it was okay. You seem to be
saying more than ws included in that colloquy.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I -- I think if -- if
you look at the whole colloquy, that's the gist of it.
I -- I have paraphrased it, but --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You've made it much
clearer than it was.
MR. SHAPIRO: Perhaps --
(Laughter.)
MR. SHAPIRO: -- perhaps I did. But I -- I
would just point out that in Osborne the lawyer didn't
make it clear at all. The lawyer didn't even propose an
instruction.
We proposed a good instruction that this
Court has quoted from emphasizing our language,
saying -- saying it correctly captures the due process
principle. So that is enough to satisfy Federal
criteria of -- of adequacy, and that is sufficient to
preserve the point. There is no dispute that this is
preserved for appellate purposes in Oregon.
Unless the Court has further questions, I --
I would reserve the balance of our time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Shapiro.
Mr. Peck.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This Court's constitutional mandate in this
case is conditioned in several significant respects, and
it invites the discretion and judgment of a State court
that's applying it. First of all, it says that States
have flexibility in coming up with a procedure to
address this procedural due process issue.
It also says that it has to be an
appropriate case; there has to be a significant risk of
juror confusion, and a request. There's no indication
in the opinion that this Court intended to federalize
the State procedure over how that request occurs.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't dispute
that it's a Federal question whether that procedure is
adequate and independent?
MR. PECK: I do not, but I also submit that
it is more than adequate. Exist -- what the Oregon
Supreme Court decided was that the existing procedure
permitting a limiting instruction to be requested -- in
Oregon it's Rule 105, same language as in the Federal
rule -- and such a request has to be timely, it has to
be specific, it has to be on the record. And Oregon
precedent says that when we mean specific, the proponent
has to give us the exact language -- this is part of the
party presentation principle -- the exact language that
they are asking us to use.
And that means that we also apply our
traditional 92-year-old rule that requests for
instruction must be clear and correct in all respects.
JUSTICE STEVENS: The problem --
JUSTICE BREYER: I would say the 28 cases
are not quite as clear as I suggested. That is, I
couldn't find in those 28 cases really a comparable
situation.
MR. PECK: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: In each instance it seemed
as if one of two things was the case: Either, A, where
the instruction was in error, it really was the matter
brought up in the first place, or the court said, but he
gave the essence of the instruction he wanted anyway.
Now, which of those cases do you think -- I
am leading up to, what of -- what of those cases do you
think is your best support, because I couldn't -- they
are not perfect.
MR. PECK: I would look first at
Reyes-Camarena, which is a 2000 -- a 2000 decision
involving the death penalty. And there, there were two
parts of this request, in a single request. The request
asked for a mitigating factors instruction, which the
court found was correct on the law and -- and would have
been given had it been asked for separately.
But it also asked the jury to consider
sympathy for the defendant, which they found to be
contrary to Oregon law, and therefore, it was not error
for the trial court to have refused this.
JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what you can't tell
from that is what was the part of the sympathy
instruction that they thought was wrong, and was the
part that they thought was wrong really part and parcel
of the part that the -- that the appellant was
complaining about.
MR. PECK: Well, the court, though, did cite
a prior decision that talked about a sympathy
instruction and claimed that this one was no different
than that. It was contained in a single instruction.
It makes clear, the opinion does, on that.
Owings v. Rose is that another case which
both parties have cited. And in Owings, it's very
clear. There you have two different parts of an
instruction that are offered at the same time, and --
and one part is right. And this -- this one deals with
third party liability.
JUSTICE BREYER: But I remember that,
because they said on that one -- some floor covering
thing, wasn't it, that they had some liability for bad
floors or designing the floors wrong --
MR. PECK: If --
JUSTICE BREYER: If that's the case, what
they said was: Don't worry about it because basically
he did give you the instruction that you wanted, though
in a different way --
MR. PECK: But --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and besides that, they
added --
MR. PECK: And besides that --
JUSTICE BREYER: You're right.
MR. PECK: -- this was an alternate ground.
Then in Hotelling v. Walther, a 1944 case,
the proposed instruction consist -- consisted of three
separate sentences, and the Court does reprint that
instruction. And each of those sentences has a
different legal proposition in it. And it was only the
last sentence, the third proposition, that the Court
found to be in error, and therefore, found that there
was no error in failing to give this instruction because
it was not clear and correct in all respects.
I -- I think that that --
JUSTICE BREYER: In the last one, what I
have here is that the court said the so-called requested
instruction was never requested at all --
MR. PECK: But --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- at all.
MR. PECK: But I do not believe that that
was the --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is the -- what is the
-- I will go look at that again. But what is the
standard? I mean, remember, I think what your brother
said at the end is correct. Imagine that yours is a
death case and we have said as a matter of Federal law
that this execution is unconstitutional, and then we
send it back. And the court then says: Oh, we forgot;
there are a couple of matters of State law here that bar
the Federal consideration of the death question. And
here they are. And then they come up with just this.
Is this -- is this a situation where you
would be equally -- that's my problem. And so, put
yourself in my shoes and -- and tell me what you would
do if this is the death case and not the case that you
have?
MR. PECK: Well, you know, it's -- it's hard
to get my arms around your hypothetical, because I don't
know the grounds on which --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just imagining that
what has happened is that the instruction that they have
given for the defendant in the death case violates
Federal law, and then we send it back, and what happens
is that the State court says, oh, it may violate Federal
law all right, but it's -- the Federal court is blocked
from considering it because there are these two other
State grounds that mean that the lawyer --
MR. PECK: I understand.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MR. PECK: But -- but the question would be
then, why would that be a situation like this, where the
trial judge -- contrary to your assumption,
Justice Ginsburg -- the trial judge did find that there
were other parts of the instructions offered by Philip
Morris that were incorrect on the law, and the illicit
profits was one of them.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't the trial judge
just stop there? I mean, if this is the ruling in the
State --
MR. PECK: Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- once the trial judge
found that one of the other instructions was bad, he
could have just said, I throw the whole thing out. Why
did he go to all the trouble of going into this, the
governing one?
MR. PECK: This is -- this is a process.
Counsel in the case in a trial in Oregon can offer
instructions every -- a proffered instruction up to the
point when the jury is instructed under their law. So
Philip Morris had the opportunity to correct it. The
practical nature of a charge conference is that the
parties come in with their proposed instructions. The
plaintiffs followed the pattern instruction, which by
the way does not require enumeration.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you are
acknowledging that the trial court did not apply the
rule --
MR. PECK: The -- it's not a rule of trial
procedure. It's a rule of appellate review.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- yes,
that's exactly right. And I think the purpose for the
rule is to avoid confusion about the ground of decision
for the trial court. If you have got two errors, and
she says the instruction's no good, on appellate review
you don't know which basis was at issue. There is no
doubt here the basis on which the trial court was
ruling, is there?
MR. PECK: I believe there is -- there --
first of all the trial judge rejected this instruction
on multiple grounds, and made it clear that the illicit
profits request was contrary to the Oregon statute that
sets up the criteria. She found other parts confusing
and contradictory. But -- and -- but there are two
things that I think are significant here.
You have to look at what was discussed
here. The trial judge, if you turn to 21a of the joint
appendix: "We are not here to punish for other
plaintiffs' harms. We are here to punish, if we are
here to punish at all, for the conduct that caused harm
to Jesse Williams on or after September 1, 1988." This
sounds very much like an acceptance of the rule that
Philip Morris was advocating.
On 19a she says: "These punitive damages
are not designed to compensate for other plaintiffs who
are not here. " On 20a there is a colloquy; she
expresses her belief that the risk is adequately guarded
against, suggests language to express that, and asks:
"Does that get you where you need to be?"
That's when Philip Morris's counsel says
"Okay." She had every reason to believe that she had
satisfied it. She then follows up.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do we give any weight in
the case to the fact that the instruction that the
Petitioners now request and the rule had not really been
announced clearly as of the time of this trial? It's
not exactly a new rule, but let's -- for our sake we
will call it a new rule. Does that have any weight?
MR. PECK: I don't think it does.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it does in our cause
and prejudice jurisprudence. In habeas, which is also a
civil action --
MR. PECK: I understand.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- we say there is an
overarching Federal principle that allows; because of
cause and prejudice, we can consider the Federal issue.
We do that all the time. Those cases weren't raised by
the Petitioner, but it seems to me they're quite
relevant here, especially when you consider the
importance of the constitutional issue, which was not
really -- let's face it -- clear to counsel on either
side of the aisle or to the trial judge.
MR. PECK: Well, here's the reason why I
think in the context of this record, and -- and this
litigant, it is not significant. And that is, if you
look at 21a, the appendix in our -- our merit brief,
there we have Philip Morris in another smoker trial in
Oregon offering up a requested instruction on this
issue. This is in 2002, so it's well before this
Court's decision in this case.
It's even before State Farm v. Campbell, and
the requested instruction says, one sentence: "You are
not to impose punishment for harms suffered by persons
other than the plaintiff before you."
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the trial judge didn't
have the benefit of -- of the ruling that this Court has
subsequently made on that point. The trial judge in
fact here said: Now, if you can give me a case, then I
will give you an instruction; you can't give me a case.
And she was right.
MR. PECK: But she -- but that's actually
not the same issue that she asked that on. Counsel
cited page 17a of the joint appendix for that question.
And if you look at the bottom of 16a, her question:
"Let me stop first and go back to the proportionality
point you are making. " This is the ratio point, the
second guidepost of BMW v. Gore. She says: "Is there
case law that says the trial court shall, in order to
have a constitutional instruction, tell the jury about
proportionality?" And this is where he says: It's
addressed post-verdict. She asks: Is there any case
law; and she says: No, I'm not going to go there. I'm
not going to go where no judge has gone before, because
she did not want to be reversed.
So she is trying to be careful, and I think
you have to credit the Oregon --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I -- it sounds
to me like that you are confirming my concerns.
MR. PECK: No. I -- I think that what she
said is as to the proportionality issue. On the other
issue, she even returns to it later when Philip Morris
bring up a different issue with respect to punitive
damages.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh. Oh, you're -- you are
saying that if our law had been clear at the time, that
she still wouldn't have given the instruction?
MR. PECK: No. I'm saying that she thought
she was complying with that. She stated on the record
that: We are not here to punish for other plaintiffs'
harms. Later on that other issue, if you look at 28a --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So your -- your contention
is, is that this trial court and the counsel in the case
had all the guidance necessary to give the correct
instruction --
MR. PECK: She --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- before -- before we
even announced the rule?
MR. PECK: She seemed to accept -- she
accepted the point before you announced the rule, and
the Oregon Court of Appeals ruling in the Estate of
Schwarz case where they offered that one-sentence
instruction, reversed the verdict, in part because that
instruction they said should have been given. So they
anticipated this Court's rule. I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To move -- to move
from the trial court to the appellate court, if you are
correct that there is this routine, clear rule of State
procedure, why would the appellate court say, in its
head, well, I could rely on that, but I want to decide
this complicated, difficult rule of Federal
constitutional law instead?
MR. PECK: Well, in fact, the -- the court
thought it was relying on it. In each of the previous
iterations in the Oregon Court of Appeals and in the
Oregon Supreme Court, they cited this rule, "clear and
correct in all respects," in order to reject the "harm
to others" instruction because they said it was
inconsistent with State law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think we just
made a mistake in going ahead and reaching the Federal
procedural rule that we reached because it was barred by
this adequate and independent State ground that the
Oregon courts had relied upon?
MR. PECK: No. What I'm saying is that they
went further then, and this is what gave this Court the
authority to rule on that substantive issue. They said
that that request was inconsistent with the Oregon
statute. And they did so -- on page 48a of the
petition, where they say: "In Williams 1, the Court of
Appeals concluded that the instruction was incorrect
under State law. We agree."
And then again on page 52a, they note that:
"That is not correct as an independent matter of Oregon
law respecting the conduct of juri trials and
instructions" --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then I think
your --
MR. PECK: But --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I think your
answer -- go ahead with your but.
(Laughter.)
MR. PECK: But then they went on to say:
"And nothing in due process requires us to look at this
differently." That's where they made their error. That
was the constitutional mistake that the Oregon court
made. They thought they were wrong on a State ground.
They thought there was no Federal issue addressing that,
and so they decided that they didn't have to reach any
other State law issues. And they ignored the well
preserved objections that Mrs. Williams made to the
other parts of this unified instruction on punitive
damages.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry. I
still don't see that answer. You are saying they said
yes, there was this rule of Oregon law, but you can
still reach -- there might still be a Federal due
process issue, so we just can't rely on that. And if
that's true, then that seems to me to be a concession
that this is not an adequate and independent State
ground that would bar consideration of a Federal
constitutional issue.
MR. PECK: What was not an adequate on
independent State grounds was their decision that the
Oregon statute which permits you to punish a misconduct
in order to deter others from doing that allowed
punishment for harm to non-parties.
That part was their interpretation of the
statute, and if there were no due process equation here,
that would have been an independent State ground. It
was wrong as a matter of due process.
But there are other grounds, other mistakes,
substantive mistakes, avoiding law in this instruction.
And any trial court that gave instruction number 34,
which was objected to as a whole, would have committed
reversible error because they failed to follow the
Oregon statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I think it's
the more routine practice for a court, if you have a --
again, as you argue -- a clear procedural rule that bars
addressing the substantive issue, to go ahead and rely
on that. Now, if the procedural rule is difficult and
of uncertain application, maybe you go ahead and say,
well, we we're going to decide on the merits anyway.
But it seems to me, under your presentation,
it's the other way around. It's a clear and easy
procedural rule, difficult Federal and State intertwined
constitutional rule, and yet the court says, well, I'm
going to do the hard work rather than the easy work.
MR. PECK: I think it was natural for the
court to do that. That was the issue presented to them
by Philip Morris. And courts do not reach out to do
other issues. They reach -- they were being solicitous
of Philip Morris, and they were addressing the arguments
that Philip Morris made. And when they decided that
that inured to Mrs. Williams benefit, not to Philip
Morris's benefit, then they said we don't need to
address your other questions. And I think have you to
look at the Oregon Supreme Court noting in their own
decision that there was no futility here. In fact, the
last time we were here Philip Morris said the reason
they needed this instruction was because of what was
said at closing argument.
JUSTICE BREYER: What are the elements?
Imagine -- I'm trying to get help, if I were to try to
put pen to paper on this. Suppose they win in this.
Then we will be back at the State law issue that I
thought was going to be there, which was the issue of --
you are talking about the colloquy. Did they give the
essence of the Federal mandated instruction, or didn't
they? And then look how cooperative the judge was, et
cetera. But that isn't before us now.
What is before us now is something that
blocks our consideration of that or anybody's
consideration of that. And imagine this is not your
case; imagine it is the most, you know, striking case,
that's why I used a death example, and we go through
exactly the same thing. And then the court does exactly
the same thing, the State court, that happened here.
And now what are the words that distinguish whether the
court is in essence, to be colloquial, giving everybody
the runaround or whether the court is applying a -- an
absolute, clear, you know, fair, standard of State law?
Which really they should have gone into first and saved
everybody a lot of trouble.
MR. PECK: I think the easiest way to look
at this --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. PECK: -- is imagine that the statute of
limitations, which now bars any such suit in Oregon,
were brought today, after this Court's decision in
Williams, and imagine that Philip Morris is the
defendant, and at the end of the trial they offer their
number 34 as it was before saying, "This Court said that
they had made the right choice in asking for this
instruction."
A trial court clearly would engage in
reversible error if they gave that instruction because
it materially departs from Oregon law. At the same
time, they could deny that instruction. They could deny
that instruction, and the Oregon Supreme Court would not
violate the mandate of this Court's decision by saying
that that is a correct decision on the part of the trial
law court because it was not clear and correct in all
respects.
And that is part of what distinguishes this.
This is still a rule that has to apply to its
instruction --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what they say is --
look at the two errors they found. One is in saying
"may" instead of "shall," and the other is in saying
"illicit profit" instead of "profit." And they are
pretty picky. So, this is very picky, they say. And
not only are they being picky, but they are being picky
after the event. And they could have raised it first,
and they have 28 cases supporting them, but none of
these cases is right on point because the subject matter
is, you know, closer bound up. And so they put all this
together and say it's an unreasonable application of a
rule that was there. And you say --
MR. PECK: I would urge you, Justice Breyer,
to look at the original case in 1916, the Sorenson case.
There the court was face with a question: If there is
the kernel of a correct instruction in there, is that
adequate to ask the court to give that instruction or
should we insist on what they thought at the time was
the majority rule in the United States, that we should
insist on an instruction that is clear and correct in
all respects, and that the -- that the counsel has the
responsibility to provide that? And they decided to go
with the clear and correct rule. That was the debate
that they had, and that debate informs this one.
JUSTICE BREYER: Sorenson was the agent and
the principal, the broker who was selling some land.
MR. PECK: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: And I think in that case
they also said, "By the way, you've got basically the
instruction that you wanted, and you overlooked" -- no,
that was the case where they said, "You overlooked in
your instruction an important allegation of fact," which
allegation was that the guy had been rehired as a
broker.
MR. PECK: And there's a similar distinction
that makes Osborne irrelevant, which counsel suggested
was a -- an exemplary here.
In Osborne, an element of the crime had not
been instructed upon. That's why there didn't have to
be the offer of an instruction. But the party
presentation principle puts the onus on counsel to do
so, and Philip Morris showed, in 2002, well before this
Court's decisions that they know how to do it when they
want to.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Peck, are you -- are
you asserting that our remand order was in error? After
all, it did say, "We remand this case so that the Oregon
Supreme Court can apply this standard we have set
forth."
MR. PECK: And I -- I'd contend, Your Honor,
that the --
JUSTICE BREYER: We didn't say it was in
error. I mean, there is nothing wrong with that.
(Laughter.)
MR. PECK: Well, I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If you say it's in error,
my next question is going to be --
MR. PECK: I think the Oregon Supreme Court
read that decision --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- can -- is it up to a
State court to sit in judgment about whether our remand
orders are in error or not?
MR. PECK: Well, I'm prepared to say that
the Oregon Supreme Court took that remand order to mean
that they had to have in place -- this was a procedural
due process decision -- that they had to have a
procedure that was fair, outcome neutral, applied --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's what they took it
to mean, they were just wrong. I mean, that's not what
it says.
MR. PECK: Well, if you look --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The opinion concludes, "As
the preceding discussion makes clear, we believe the
Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong constitutional
standard when considering Philip Morris's appeal." And
it goes to the constitutional issue we are talking
about.
MR. PECK: When considering --
JUSTICE SCALIA: "We remand so that the
Oregon Supreme Court can apply the standard we have set
forth," which has nothing to do with the issue we have
been discussing this morning.
MR. PECK: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So it was wrong?
MR. PECK: No, it was not wrong. I don't
think it was wrong, and here's the reason I don't think
it was wrong: You corrected the Oregon Supreme Court
when that thought that due process does not inform the
analysis on harm to non-parties. You corrected that
substantive error, and that part is what they got wrong.
Much of this opinion said that they got lots
of other things right. And so Oregon looked at it and
said, "Okay, we got that issue wrong, but there are
other problems with this instruction that are adequate
and independent grounds for --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's very nice, but
that's not what we remanded for.
MR. PECK: You did not remand for that, but
when this Court decides a constitutional issue of one
part, it doesn't necessarily tell the court anything
different. What -- the essence of this Court's opinion
is that where there's a significant risk of jury
confusion, the State has to provide a procedure and has
flexibility in providing that procedure. There is no
indication that the procedure for limiting instructions
does not satisfy that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: The problem that I think we
all have is how do we guard, in effect, guard against
making constitutional decisions which are simply going
to be nullified by some clever device raising a
procedural issue or an issue of State law when the case
goes back? Is there any way for us to ensure against,
in effect, a bad faith response to our decision except
by purporting to require the State courts to follow a
certain order of battle in the decision of issues before
them so that when the case gets to us, we can be assured
that there is no lurking issue that has not yet been
decided as a matter of State law that in effect could
then be resurrected to nullify our decision? Is there
any way to guard against that except by telling the
State courts what the sequence is in which they have to
make decisions?
MR. PECK: I believe there is. And I
believe that it would be error to suggest to the State
supreme court that they must, even though prudent,
follow a specific sequence, simply because that would
mean that they would have to necessarily decide every
State law issue in the case --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I see the problem. I
mean, that's why I raised the question, how can we
ensure --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we do that all the
time in cause and prejudice cases. We do it all the
time --
MR. PECK: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- because of the
importance of the constitutional right.
MR. PECK: I understand that, but I think
the adequate and independent State law ground provides
all the protection. You assume, and I think properly
so, that State supreme courts will operate in good
faith. Even in Flowers, after the fourth trip to the
U.S. Supreme Court, were -- Alabama Supreme Court was
still trusted to apply the decision.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Your -- your answer
is there is -- there is no way to guard against it
except --
MR. PECK: Except --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- by reviewing the good
faith of what the court does on remand.
MR. PECK: Well, by -- by accepting that if
the rule that has been imposed was invoked properly by
the party that invoked it at the right time --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
MR. PECK: -- that it IS firmly established
and regularly followed, then it should satisfy the
Court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it serves very little
interest. Nothing the trial judge would have done,
nothing the plaintiff's counsel has done below, nothing
that the intermediate clause would have done, would have
-- would have been different if they had submitted what
they call the "correct in all respects" rule.
If they had filed the "correct in all
respects" rule and submitted that rule -- if she had
said, judge, I want to type a little piece of paper,
everything would have been the same.
MR. PECK: I suggest that it would be
different. I think the Oregon Supreme Court decided,
when they decided that there was no futility in offering
another one, that it would be different. And the fact
of the matter is that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I excluded the Oregon
Supreme Court from my list of -- of participants who
would have done something differently.
MR. PECK: But -- but -- but the fact of the
matter is, if after closing arguments which was the
trigger that Philip Morris urged upon this Court for
needing this substantive rule, if after -- if after that
Philip Morris's counsel had returned to the judge -- you
know, they said a few things that we think would tell
the jury to punish for harm to others. We don't think
the instruction is adequate. We will give you the same
instruction, that one-sentence instruction like we gave
in Fink v. Schwarz. I believe the court would have
given that instruction.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is, of course,
another way to protect our constitutional authority in
this case. We are talking about procedures for
addressing the substantive due-process challenge to
a punitive damages award. That is the second question
presented here.
If we went and granted that question and
considered that issue, we would have protected our
authority to reach that question despite the procedural
objections alone. Why don't we just do that?
MR. PECK: Well, Your Honor, of course, the
last time we were here you had a full briefing and even
some argument on that. And I -- I believe that we are
prepared to stand on that briefing and argument.
We do not believe the Due Process Clause is
an exercise in elementary school mathematics. It does
not tell you something about this. Here you have to
look at the enormity of the misconduct. And that did --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not asking you
to argue here today the second question presented.
MR. PECK: I understand.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if we have some
concern, if there is something malodorous about the fact
that the Oregon Supreme Court waited until the last
minute to come up with this rule that was before it all
the time, which was a State court rule that you would
expect the State court to be addressing as a matter of
course, then -- then we -- we can avoid having to
address what we do in a situation, having to
characterize the nature of that -- that consideration,
simply by saying: Look, we are going to go ahead with
the questions presented. We can decide it in this case;
and to avoid having to reach that, we will go ahead and
do it.
MR. PECK: Well, it's -- it's certainly
within this Court's power to do that. Philip Morris had
made a very harsh accusation in this case of bad faith
on the part of the Oregon Supreme Court. There was no
sandbagging here. The Oregon court did not act in that
way.
Mrs. Williams raised the State-law issues at
every opportunity, which is something that Philip Morris
denied in their petition but then conceded in their
merit brief. And the fact is it was before the Oregon
Court of Appeals. It was before the Oregon Supreme
Court, and we even raised it before this court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- in answer to the
Chief Justice, you are not suggesting that we should go
ahead and decide the second question when there has been
no briefing on it?
MR. PECK: I am not suggesting that you
decide the question, but I recognize the Court has the
power to do so. Mapp v. Ohio came to this Court as a
First Amendment case and came out as a Fourth Amendment
case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I thought --
Mr. Peck, I thought you just told me that there has been
full and adequate briefing on that question.
MR. PECK: I believe we had full and
adequate briefing. We may not have had an opportunity
to fully argue the case, and it's up for you to decide
whether or not you -- you have enough on that.
I thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Shapiro, you have three minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Justice Breyer asked about these various cases from
Oregon, whether they provided guidance and a warning
here. And counsel referred to three cases, Reeve,
Owings and then Sorenson. If you look at those cases,
you will see there were simple instructions proposed on
a single topic that were infected with an error
throughout.
And the court said if there is any valid
proportion of this instruction, it was covered by
something that was said to the jury already. So there
was no harm in not giving that instruction.
That is certainly not our case. We have a
separately numbered paragraph dealing with the
Constitution, which is quite apart from the statutory
factors.
Now, counsel referred to the charge actually
given by the court as if it provided some protection
against punishment for harm to nonparties. If you read
that instruction, far from providing the protection that
the -- this Court said was obligatory, it invited global
punishment. It told the jury they could return any
punitive-damage award up to one hundred million dollars.
Lo and behold, they come up with eighty million dollars,
right within the suggested range of this charge. And
there was no --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which portion of the
charge specifically are you referring to?
MR. SHAPIRO: This is page 37a of our joint
appendix. The -- the court concludes the amount of
punitive damages you assess may not exceed the sum of
one hundred million dollars. And that, of course, was
the zone of reasonableness that the jury inferred from
this, suggesting a global punishment to the jury with no
protection.
Now this Court said that that protection has
to be provided. The Court said the State must insist,
that the State must give assurance, and it's an
important constitutional right, as Justice Kennedy said.
I don't think the State court --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is your response to
the Chief Justice's suggestion that maybe we should
reach the issue of due process on the amount?
MR. SHAPIRO: We wouldn't oppose that
because this is clearly excessive under what the Court
said in State Farm: Where there is substantial
compensatory damages, one to one is something of a norm.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I wasn't asking to
you argue it, either but I mean I suppose the procedure
the parties would prefer, if we were interested in that,
would be for us to grant the second question and then
have the normal briefing in consideration.
MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, that -- that -- yes,
certainly, that -- that -- that is true. I -- I would
comment, too, on Justice Breyer's question about what is
the ultimate test here.
The Court has stated various criteria and
opinions over the last century, but the -- the key ideas
are? Was it an ambush, something that couldn't be
anticipated?
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean I will tell you my
subjective reaction going through these 38 cases is they
are not quite in point, but they really take away the
idea of the bad faith, particularly because the first
time what the judge said, which I didn't understand its
significance then, but the judge said: Well, since the
first part of that paragraph was in -- was in error
anyway, I don't have to reach the question of whether
there were other mistakes under State law in the rest of
the instruction. They did say that the first time, I
think.
MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes, but this is the first
time the Court has ever taken this "correct in all
respects" rule and extended it to a completely different
topic, U.S. constitutional law in a separately numbered
paragraph. And we had no notice that this had to be
broken out on a separate piece of paper. If we did, we
would have broken it out on a separate piece of paper.
It's just like Lee against Kemna where the Court said --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about this point
that was made that in 2002 that is exactly what Philip
Morris did, give one simple, precise instruction?
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, no, that instruction was
not harm to nonparties. That was harm for out-of-State
injuries. It was a different issue. And it's true the
lawyers there did break up their instructions
differently, but the pattern instruction --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- is it true that
they gave one simple sentence stating their position on
-- on what harm to others, how that --
MR. SHAPIRO: No. That's not true. That
case did not accept our instruction. It did not. It
accepted the State Farm instruction, which said that
there can't be punishment for out-of-State harm.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but was the
instruction stated in a -- in a single paragraph, but
all the other requests to charge were broken out?
MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. This -- this State Farm
instruction was broken out. That's an option for
lawyers. But under the pattern instruction, it's quite
proper to put them all in one instructional basket.
That's what the form instructions said, and that's what
both parties here did.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
MR. SHAPIRO: We thank the Court.
