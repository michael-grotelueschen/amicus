ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
In this case we find ourselves in the happy
situation of having to try to convince the Court that
its prior decisions were correct. Just 5 years after
the enactment of FELA, the Court declared that it was
obvious that the statute contained a proximate cause
requirement. The Court went on to repeat that
conclusion over and over again in almost two dozen
decisions over the next 40 years. Our submission this
morning is that the Court when it made these statements
got it right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: How did it happen that in
FELA we have proximate cause light? It's just a
different proximate cause than we see in other -- in
other torts cases. How -- how did that come about?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, we -- we -- our
submission is that that is not correct, that that is not
what FELA provides for at all. And in the Court's
initial decisions, the ones that I referred to, it
stated very clearly that the ordinary proximate cause
rule applies. The -- the proximate cause test that the
Court stated in cases like Brady was the traditional
proximate cause standard.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you read the cases as
indicating that more deference is given to juries in
FELA cases than in other cases?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that's -- is a
separate one from the one we have here. I mean, we are
talking here about the nature of the -- the elements of
the cause of action that have to be demonstrated by --
by the plaintiff; and so there -- the question of how
much of that evidence there has to be to get to the jury
is a separate question that's not presented here.
Our submission, since you posed the
question, is that there is no different standard; that
FELA was not intended to depart from the ordinary common
law procedural approaches in that respect, either.
But on the question that's presented --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But juries usually find
against railroads anyway, right?
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I wouldn't want to
commit myself to answering that question affirmatively,
Your Honor.
The Court has said that -- that FELA was
enacted to address particular problems in the
administration of the common law prior to 1908.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It also said that there's
a relaxed standard of causation. I think that's what
Justice Kennedy is referring to when he said "proximate
cause light." But we have said in more than one case
that there is a relaxed standard of causation in FELA
cases. Was that wrong?
MR. ROTHFELD: I think there are two ways to
respond to that, Justice Ginsburg. The first is that up
until the Rogers decision, which is -- which is one of
the ones which has created I think some confusion in
this area, the Court was quite clear and unambiguous
that proximate cause in FELA applied in the ordinary
sense.
As I say, in cases like the Brady case the
Court stated what proximate cause means; it stated in --
in entirely traditional terms that -- that the plaintiff
had to demonstrate that the injury followed in a
natural, probable foreseeable way from the wrongful
conduct, and so that -- that was the standard.
The Rogers case, which was the source of
some of the confusion in this area, in our view, as --
as we think Justice Souter correctly demonstrated in his
opinion in Sorrell, and as we explain at some length in
our brief, Rogers we think did not address causation at
all. The Rogers case was a situation in which there
were a multiplicity of causes, and the question was what
-- what should -- should the rule be when there are a
number of -- of entities that contribute to the
accident. It had nothing to do with remoteness or
directness of the cause, what we usually think about
when we talk about proximate cause.
In -- in the years since Rogers was decided,
when the Court -- got out of the business of deciding
FELA cases on the facts, it had not had occasion on --
in any case to address specifically what proximate cause
meant in the FELA context.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we have used that
language. You -- you have not responded to -- to the
question where -- where did this language that does
appear in our -- in our cases about the relaxed
standard, where -- where does that come from?
MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that comes from, W
submit, from sort of a loose description of what was
going on in the Rogers case, which involved a
multiplicity of causes rather than directness and
remoteness of causes, and so the cases in which that
language appears, which are the Crane case and the
Gottshall case, did not involve causation at all. The
question of causation was not presented to the Court in
those cases.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has nothing to do with
the line of cases I think in the '40s in the FELA cases
where the message of this Court seemed to be quite
clear, FELA cases go to juries? There are a number of
cases with reverse dissents that seem to -- to say just
that.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that goes to
the question that Justice Kennedy raised at the outset,
which is how much evidence, whatever the standard of
causation is, how much evidence must there be to go to
the jury? And our presentation here is that FELA did
not change the ordinary standard on -- on that question.
But that -- but that is not the question that's
presented in this case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what -- can you
explain to me -- I mean, here the judge charged in the
words of the statute, and they are also the words used
in the model Federal instruction: Did plaintiff's
injury result in whole or in part from the railroad's
negligence?
You would say: Was plaintiff's injury
proximately caused. And as you no doubt know,
Mr. Rothfeld, that term "proximate cause," it just loses
juries. So considering that these cases go to the jury,
what do you say to the instruction that's now given,
based on the words of the statute, "Did plaintiff's
injury result in whole or part from the railroad's
negligence"? What should the judge charge instead of
that?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think there are --
there are two parts to your question, Justice Ginsburg.
One -- one is, what's wrong with the instruction that
was given here; and the other is can juries understand
proximate cause as a concept.
On -- on the first point, we have no
objection to the instruction containing the language of
the statute. The problem is that to be comprehensible
and intelligently applied by jurors, it has to say more
than that. Proximate cause we submit is an element of
the cause of action and that has to be explained to a
jury. It couldn't be the case in a Sherman Act case,
for example, that a judge could simply charge the jury:
You are to determine whether there has been an
unreasonable restraint of trade; now go to the jury room
and answer that question. There is a lot more that has
to go into that cause of action, including, as it
happens, proximate cause.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, could you
explain to me how it would have made a difference in
this case, that instruction?
MR. ROTHFELD: It -- it would have made a
difference I guess in two respects. One is that the
plaintiff's theory has never at any point been that
there was proximate cause in this case. He did not
contend that there was before the -- the district court
and he does not contend in his brief before this Court
that there was proximate cause made out. And so --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe explain the
difference. I mean, you were answering my question, and
I asked how would you tell the jury? You said it's okay
to say: Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in
part from the railroad's negligence, but the judge must
say something more. So what is the something more?
MR. ROTHFELD: The something more is what
this Court said in its Brady decision, in which it
described -- the decision in Brady, which is cited and
discussed in our opening brief in -- in some detail.
Brady described what proximate cause means in the FELA
context; and it means, the Court said, that there must
be a demonstration that the plaintiff's injury resulted
from the wrongful conduct in a way that was natural,
probable, and foreseeable. That -- that was a
traditional statement, is still today a traditional
statement of proximate cause.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Natural, probable, and
foreseeable?
MR. ROTHFELD: And foreseeable. That --
that language was taken in the Brady case directly from
the Court's decision, 1876 decision in the Kellogg
decision, which we also cite in our brief, which states
--
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me -- there
is an article that suggests that juries don't actually
understand what "proximate cause" means; and I think,
and Justice Ginsburg can correct me, that what does that
mean to a jury -- natural, probable, and foreseeable?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are the three phrases
different? And how much more detail do you have to get
in to describe that difference in a comprehensible way?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that was the
second part of Justice Ginsburg's question, and I got
distracted, and I'm happy to address it. I think most
of the criticism of proximate cause as being confusion
to the jury has actually been directed at the word
"proximate," that commentators and some courts have said
that's a confusing word, it suggests immediacy, it
suggests closeness in time, it sounds like
"approximate," and so juries find it confusing.
But there is -- once it's spelled out, I
mean, the fact is juries have been applying proximate
cause, which has been a fundamental, settled, universal,
universally accepted part of common law of torts, in the
medicine context in particular, and it has been settled
for 150 years.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Apparently only FELA juries
cannot understand it; all other juries find it okay.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- it is our
submission that FELA juries would have no more
difficulty applying it than do juries under the Sherman
Act or RICO or the securities laws or, the other
statutes that this Court has said include a proximate
cause requirement, or that juries apply every day in
courts across the country in court cases.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just don't -- and
maybe this has already been asked, but I'm not sure from
a juror's perspective that it makes terribly much
difference the exact formulation of this instruction. I
think a juror who sees an employee is suing the
railroad, and it turns out that what the railroad did
had very little or nothing to do with what happened to
the employee, they don't need an instruction about
natural, foreseeable causes. They're just not going to
give the awards, or they're going to give the awards
even though the railroad didn't do anything that
affected the employee.
It's a -- it's a nuance that I just don't
think has any practical significance.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, we have to assume that
juries follow jury instructions. That's the fundamental
premise of the system, and there is no reason to doubt
that in the ordinary case, in which the contents of
proximate cause are -- are explained to the jury in an
intelligent -- in a way that -- that people can
comprehend.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Your client is entitled to
have the jury disregard a proper instruction, right?
That's what you're arguing?
MR. ROTHFELD: If the -- if the jury --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Juries disregard
instructions on probable cause, on proximate cause.
They probably do it in non-FELA cases, too.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're entitled to have
them disregard the correct instruction rather than an
incorrect instruction, right?
MR. ROTHFELD: I will endorse that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is that I
don't see much practical difference between what you
argue is the correct instruction and what your friend
argues is the correct instruction.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, certainly, in terms --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, law
students, professors, and some judges have had trouble
defining the concept of proximate cause for centuries.
I don't know why we expect a juror to be able to
navigate through those nuances, either.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- the -- the
principle of proximate cause, the idea that there has to
be some limitation beyond but-for causation on
liability, has been universally recognized. Recognized
by -- by courts, by this Court, by commentators, by the
Restatement. The Third Restatement, just published,
clearly endorsed it. They use -- they quibble about the
terminology, but they clearly endorsed the absolute
necessity of a proximate cause limitation on liability.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that over the
last few decades, there's been an increasing emphasis on
foreseeability as a component of proximate cause?
MR. ROTHFELD: There -- there probably has
been. I mean, I'll defer again to the Third
Restatement, which has a very useful summary of the
course of the law in this area. And the principal tests
that are now being used by courts are foreseeability and
directness, which are closely related, I think. I mean,
clearly, as this Court stated just this month in the
Stout case, it stated a test of proximate cause in terms
of whether --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you give some
examples of what causes would be proximate and what
causes would not so qualify? Something that's -- you
said but-for is no good. So what would be a but-for
cause but not a proximate cause?
MR. ROTHFELD: A but-for cause in this
context would be, there's a defective brake on -- on the
locomotive and it comes to a sudden stop. If the
conductor, standing in the locomotive when the train
stops, is thrown to the floor and injured, clearly that
is proximate cause. It -- it is -- it is an injury that
is related to the risk that made the conduct actionable
in the first place.
The reason that having defective brakes is
negligent and gives rise to a cause of action is because
it can cause an accident that will cause people to fall,
cause the train to hit something, will cause derailment.
That's why it is negligent, and if the kind of injury
that follows from the accident is related to that risk,
that clearly is proximate cause.
The kind which is not would be, train stops
because of the defective brake. No one is injured.
Conductor gets off the train to walk along and see
what's going on, trips and turns his leg, or is bitten
by a snake.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, are there any
cases like that in the FELA world? You know, I take it
that this basic instruction that was given in this case
is the instruction that's given in most cases. If you
look across the range of cases, do you find jurors
awarding damages in the kind of situation that you're
talking about? In other words, is this a real-world
problem?
MR. ROTHFELD: They did in precisely the
case I just described, a case called Richards from the
Sixth Circuit, which is cited in the amicus brief
submitted by the Association of American Railroads. The
train stops because of a defective brake, the conductor
gets off, walks along, turns his ankle and sues.
Clearly, the risk of someone getting off the
train and having a fortuitous injury is not the kind of
risk that gave rise to the negligence. I mean, it's
negligent to have a defective brake, but not because
there's a bystander who might be bitten by a snake or
turn -- turn his ankle.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a case like that?
MR. ROTHFELD: As I said, the Richards case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I mean somebody
might think that having to go off and patrol a thing in
a rough area is something that happens with a sudden
stop: You run a risk of turning your leg.
I agree with you about the snake. Is there
any case about the snake?
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I can't cite you a snake
case directly, but --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the furthest --
the furthest -- the furthest that you go is the case of
sudden stop in the wilderness, gets off, rough area, and
twists his ankle.
MR. ROTHFELD: Or I'll -- I'll cite you --
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. Is that
proximate cause or not? Maybe it isn't.
MR. ROTHFELD: I'll give you two answers to
that, Your Honor. First of all, there are other cases.
Another case, for example, cited in the amicus brief
that I referred to is the Schlumpert case from Georgia,
in which there's a defective coupling device lying on
the ground. If it had -- if it had fallen off the train
because it was defective and fallen on someone's foot,
clearly that's proximate cause. But it's on the ground.
The employee comes along, picks it up, throws off --
throws off his -- throws out his back, and sues. That
is not the kind of -- of injury that one would foresee
comes from having defective couplers.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And do you want --
what instruction would you give that would tell the jury
to allow damages in one of those -- the first of the
coupling cases, but not in the second?
MR. ROTHFELD: The instruction we ask for is
the one this Court gave -- said should be given in the
Brady case: Natural, foreseeable, and probable. It is
not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are jurors going to
sit there and say, one of those is natural, foreseeable,
and probable, but the other isn't?
MR. ROTHFELD: I would -- I would say that
it is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know what
"natural" means. You know, so it's not a supernatural
situation?
(Laughter.)
MR. ROTHFELD: Well -- well, I'm just
quoting the Court's language to you, Your Honor. But --
but certainly, foreseeable and probable, one would say
that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not foreseeable
that if you drop a coupling where it's not supposed to
be, somebody will come along and try to pick it up and
move it?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, but it's not
foreseeable in the sense that it is unrelated to the
risk that gave rise to -- to the cause of action in the
first place. I mean, it's foreseeable in the sense that
anything is foreseeable.
If I give the classic example: I drive -- I
drive you to New York, from Washington to New York, and
I drive too fast, exceeding the speed limit. That's
negligent. It's negligent because I run the risk, if I
drive too fast, of hitting somebody, of hitting another
car, of driving off the road. And so if I do that and
you're injured as I drive you to New York, you can sue
me.
But that doesn't happen. I drive -- I get
to New York safely, you get out of the car, and as soon
as you get out, you are struck by lightning. It's a
but-for cause of your being struck by lightning that I
drove too fast. You wouldn't have been there when the
lightning struck.
JUSTICE BREYER: You could have been bitten
by a snake when you're getting out of t car.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: But there has been no such
case, to your knowledge?
MR. ROTHFELD: Or -- or, more likely, you
could have been hit -- hit by a car driving across Fifth
Avenue too fast.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, your
instruction actually used the term "probable cause."
Are you -- "proximate cause." Are you saying now that
that's not necessary, that as long as you say
"reasonable and foreseeable," you would be satisfied?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that it should
include the term "proximate" simply because that has
traditionally been the requirement. That's what this
Court has said in cases like Brady. It's what the Court
has said in cases applying other proximate cause --
other elements of proximate causation in other
circumstances. But it is the concept.
I mean, as I said, "proximate" is a
confusing word. That has been recognized sort of across
the board. So it has to be spelled out and unpacked.
JUSTICE KAGAN: So why use it at all? If
you think that "reasonable" or "foreseeable" are less
confusing words, why shouldn't we just tell the jury to
use those words instead?
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- again, I don't think
that it is essential that it use the word "proximate" if
it spells out what is meant by "proximate" in -- in --
as --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the spelling out is
natural, probable, and foreseeable?
MR. ROTHFELD: Again, that is the term that
this Court used in Brady, and that is -- is closely
related --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Although your proposed
instruction didn't use the word "foreseeable"?
MR. ROTHFELD: It did not use the word
"foreseeable." It used "natural and probable." But
we -- we endorse, again, the test that this Court has
stated in the FELA context very clearly in the Brady
case. There are -- as has been noted in some of the
questioning, there has been discussion between courts
and commentators over the years about what the best way
is to define proximate cause and explain it to the jury.
I mean, in terms of the question posed by
the Chief Justice, does it actually make any difference,
I think not only do we have to assume that it makes a
difference, because juries are presumed to follow their
instructions, but the kind of instruction that was given
here was essentially a but-for instruction, that if you
find that -- that in any respect, the injuries
essentially would not have occurred but for the
misconduct, for the -- for the negligence of the
railroad --
JUSTICE ALITO: Could you explain how it
might have made a difference in this particular case
based on the facts of the case? As I understand it,
Mr. McBride's theory was that as a result of having to
use the independent brake extensively over a long period
of time with this wide-bodied cab, his hand got tired
and it fell, and it hit the independent brake.
Is that -- that's the theory?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well -- that -- that --
that's his explanation of the accident. The theory of
negligence, as I understand it, as it was presented to
the jury by his expert was that the configuration of the
train that he was driving was unsafe because it -- it
could lead to derailments, it could lead to breaking of
the couplers.
As explained by his expert, the -- the
theory was not that there was something unsafe about the
arrangement of the braking system, and so, I think that
the -- the way in which a proximate cause instruction
properly given here could have made a difference is that
the jury could have found, well, yes, it was negligent
to have these five locomotives arranged in the way that
they were, but that had nothing to do, except in a but-
for sense, with the fact that the -- the -- that
Mr. McBride's hand was injured; that the jury could have
made that determination and so it could have made a
difference.
Now, I mean, the fact is there was no
proximate cause argument made below because the
instruction that was given by the district court
excluded it. And so, as I said before, the -- the
theory of the case advanced by Mr. McBride below simply
didn't take account of proximate cause.
Now, if the -- if we prevail here and the
case goes back, he will be free to argue under a proper
instruction that there was proximate cause, that somehow
the configuration of the train affected his -- his
handling of the brake.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're really suggesting
that the defense attorney here wouldn't have argued the
concept of proximate cause in saying the negligence had
nothing to do with him just deciding to hit the brake?
MR. ROTHFELD: The --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I -- I -- I -- it's
farfetched, don't you think, that because the judge
refused to give a proximate cause charge that the idea
of it wasn't argued to the jury: What we did didn't
cause this.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, there -- there is no
question that what the railroad did caused in the but-
for sense. Mr. McBride would not have been in the cab
operating the brake system had it -- had it not been for
the configuration of the -- of the locomotives. And, so
if we assume that the configuration of the locomotives
was negligent, then but for the negligence of -- of the
railroad, this would not have occurred. And that in
fact is -- is the terms in which the case was argued to
the jury by Mr. McBride's lawyer, who said, in so many
words: But for the negligence of the railroad, this
would not have occurred.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So the -- but the question
is, what was your argument? What was your side's
argument? Did you argue, in effect, proximate cause?
MR. ROTHFELD: Our side argued that there
was no negligence at all, that -- that -- that the
configuration of the railroad was perfectly proper, and
that -- the -- the -- there was a contributory
negligence component to what was going on here. In
fact, the jury found that Mr. McBride was contributorily
negligent in part, and that was part of the -- of the
defense presentation, too.
But just two or three -- to take a step back
to first principles, on the assumption that proximate
cause -- that there is a difference between instructing
the jury on proximate cause and not, because the court
-- it has been a part of tort law, you know, for time
immemorial on the assumption that it does make a
difference and it has been an important part of tort law
because it has been universally recognized by courts, by
academics, by the Respondent that there has to be some
limitation on liability beyond but-for causation. If
there is not, there is the danger of sort of infinite
liability, of limitless liability, and particularly of
fortuitous liability, because there is no way that the
defendant in a situation like this can anticipate that
it's going to be held liable for this kind of injury.
So proximate cause has been regarded as an
essential component of the tort law. And that being so,
FELA creates a Federal cause of action for negligence,
it creates a Federal tort. It -- a fundamental
principle of statutory interpretation, this Court has
applied many times, most recently just this month in the
Staub case, that when Congress creates a Federal tort,
it means to adopt the general background of tort law,
and Congress --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there any -- any
negligence-type statutes? I mean this one, I mean, it's
odd to say that the judge erred in reading to the jury
the words of the statute, did plaintiff's injury result
in whole or in part from railroad negligence. All that
Federal statutes, negligence statutes that use the word
"proximate" --
MR. ROTHFELD: There are -- there are
Federal statutes that use the word "proximate." I don't
know that there are any negligence statutes. So far as
I understand from our review of the law, at the time
that Congress enacted FELA in 1908, there -- there were
no such statutes that made use of the term "proximate."
And the presumption then, as now, is that
when Congress creates what amounted to a Federal tort,
the assumption is that it intends to adopt a background
of tort law. That was true in the Sherman Act, it was
true in RICO, it was true in securities laws, it was
true just as earlier this month in the Staub case, a
statute which did not use the term "proximate."
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said your defense
at trial was not about causation, it was no negligence,
right?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that's -- that's right.
Given the instruction that the jury received, which does
not -- did not include a proximate cause requirement,
and given that if one assumes that there was negligence,
there is no doubt that the -- that the injury here was
the but-for product of that negligence, there sort of
was no room for negligence to be argued to the jury on
the defense side. I mean, for proximate -- for --
for -- for causation to be argued on the defense side.
JUSTICE ALITO: Assume you could talk to the
jury and the jury says to you: We found negligence, so
we don't want to hear about that; and we've found but-
for causation and we don't want to hear about that; now,
explain to us why there isn't proximate cause here?
What more -- what -- what would you say?
MR. ROTHFELD: In -- in this case we would
say the negligence that is being presented to you and
that you have presumably found is that the configuration
of these locomotives was dangerous because it could lead
to derailment, it could lead to breaking of the couplers
between the cars. That is the negligence. And
proximate cause, properly understood, means that the
injury on which the plaintiff is suing has to follow in
a probable, natural, foreseeable way from that -- that
negligence.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But wasn't the theory
different, Mr. Rothfeld? Wasn't the theory that the
configuration of the train made the braking and the
switching much more difficult for the person in this
position?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, if I may, I'll answer
that and then sit down.
That, as I say, was not the theory that was
presented by the plaintiff's expert. To the extent that
that is -- is a viable theory, it could be presented on
remand. The argument can be made. I think it's a
difficult argument, but -- but it was not presented to
the jury here because there was no proximate cause
instruction, so there was no opportunity for the
question to be -- be -- be vetted.
And with that, thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case is a case that presents a
non-existent problem and a solution that is in search of
a non-existent problem, because there are no real
reported cases where there have been problems arising
under the Rogers instructions that have become the model
instructions under the Federal Rules for over 50 years.
And if could I just begin, Justice Kennedy,
with your question which opened this up, proximate cause
serves two principal functions. One is to limit the
scope of the persons to whom the tortfeasor owes a duty;
and the second is to limit the kinds of injuries that
that person would be liable for.
The innovation in FELA that is so important
to understand about why the relaxed causation standard
became the accepted standard under FELA was that FELA,
by its plain terms, did away with the first concept of
proximate cause because it limited the duty to the
employee by the employer. There is no one outside of
that relationship that can bring an action under FELA.
And the second thing that it did was it put
into what is now section 51 that if the negligence
results in, quote, "in whole or in part" from the
negligence of the railroad, that is enough for injury.
At common law the proximate cause standard required that
the railroad's negligence be the sole cause. So the
innovation that created the relaxation in the causation
standard was the inclusion of these words in part, and
so over time --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the other side
says that what that meant, and -- and -- and the
language of our cases seems to support that, "in whole
or in part" simply eliminated the common law doctrine of
contributory negligence, whereby if the plaintiff also
had been negligent, the plaintiff could not recover,
and -- and FELA uses a -- a -- a comparative negligence
standard.
MR. FREDERICK: And this Court has rejected
that kind of approach almost from the beginning of the
statute. In Campbell in 1916, the Court asked whether
FELA has completely eliminated the idea of proximate
cause. The Court has eliminated and the plain language
precludes the sole cause, immediate cause, direct cause,
last cause, substantial factor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't "in whole or in
part" apply to the elimination of contributory
negligence? Isn't that an adequate explanation for the
language?
MR. FREDERICK: It's -- it's not one that's
consistent with the Court's cases. And let me point you
back to the day Rogers was decided. If we accept for
purposes of argument -- and I'm only accepting it for
these purposes -- that Rogers was only about multiple
causes, on the very same day it decided two other cases
that arguably were only about single causes. It decided
a case under the Jones Act, the Ferguson case, and it
decided another case under FELA, the Webb case. In both
of those cases, there were no multiple causes, there was
no contributory negligence; but what the Court said was
that on today we are announcing this standard, we apply
that standard to overturn directed verdicts where juries
had come to the conclusion that the railroad's
negligence had played a part, even a slight one, in
producing the injury sustained by the worker.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that the
phrase in the statute "in whole or in part" allows
juries to impose liability based on but-for causation?
MR. FREDERICK: No. The --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why -- why not?
MR. FREDERICK: As this Court put a gloss on
that language in Rogers, it -- it construed those words
to mean that the railroad's negligence has to be found
to have played a role, however slight, in producing the
injury. Thus in Mr. --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what but-for cause
means. Tell me about the snake. Is the snake covered?
MR. FREDERICK: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?
MR. FREDERICK: Because the railroad's
negligence there --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Once you abandon a
proximate cause requirement, however you want to define
that, I don't see why the snake isn't covered, or the
lightning on 42nd Street.
MR. FREDERICK: Because there the railroad's
negligence played no part in producing the jury. It's
the producing aspect that provides a little bit more --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure it did. The train
wouldn't have stopped, the conductor wouldn't have
gotten off, he wouldn't have been bitten by the snake.
If the -- if the car had not traveled to New York over
the speed limit, the -- the passenger wouldn't have been
on 42nd Street when the lightning struck. I mean, how
can you say it didn't play a part? Of course it played
a part.
MR. FREDERICK: It was certainly an element
of the existence of the condition. But what the Court's
cases, Justice Scalia, after Rogers have done, and I
think this is an important part of the history, is that
there are a couple of outlier cases, to be sure. Courts
have corrected them all by saying that the judge -- that
the jury could not have reasonably found based on common
experience that this snake bite or what have you was
proximately related to -- played a part.
JUSTICE BREYER: As I read the statute -- as
I read the statute, it insists, as interpreted in
Rogers, that the negligence has to play a part in
producing, and in the snake case the negligence doesn't
matter. It's simply the timing, et cetera. And is --
that's how I read it.
MR. FREDERICK: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: And I guess that's how
courts have read it. I'm not sure; you know. And I
suspect from the answers I've gotten so far there's
never been a court that read it differently.
MR. FREDERICK: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that correct?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That negligence didn't play
a part?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But for the negligence, the
train would not have stopped. How can you say the
negligence didn't play a part? Had the train not
stopped, he wouldn't have been walking along and been
bitten by the snake.
MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean do words mean
anything? How can you possibly say that negligence
didn't play a part? It obviously did. It seems to me
you're arguing for -- not the nonexistence of proximate
cause. Nobody in his right mind could argue for the
nonexistence of proximate cause. You are arguing for
some different -- different definition of proximate
cause, and I would like to know what that -- what that
new definition is, as opposed to the definition that Mr.
Rothfeld proposed.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, let me start with this
by saying that the Court and the language of the statute
have already eliminate six possibilities for proximate
cause; and the question now is whether there's something
additive to the words that Mr. Rothfeld now proposes for
the first time, because this was not language that they
proposed in their proffered jury instruction, which can
be found in the red brief at page 11. There they
followed the Illinois proposed instruction which says
"natural or probable sequence." That language does not
appear in Brady. In Brady, a 1943 case from this Court,
the words are used "natural and probable consequence," a
consequence, of course, being a result, a sequence being
an order of events.
Now, their instruction rests on the word
"probable," which of course in common understanding and
most juries would commonly understand, "probable" means
more likely than not, which is directly in contention
with the statutory words "in part," and directly
contrary to the way courts had universally understood
this language since Rogers.
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know if they said
this, but I mean, as I read it, I thought the reason
that negligence doesn't play a part is the act which was
negligent played a part, of course; it was "but for";
but the fact that it is negligent is totally irrelevant,
because it's not within the risk in any sense
whatsoever.
Now as I -- you know the area. I don't put
-- don't just agree with me because I'm saying it. Is
that roughly the --
MR. FREDERICK: That is correct, Justice
Breyer. And in the cases -- and there really are only a
few cases where you can find these kind of outlier facts
and these kind of, you know, "out there" situations, and
one of the reasons is because FELA is only a
compensatory damages statute. It only addresses the
actual injury and the compensation for the worker.
There are no punitive damages, there are no attorney's
fees, there are no treble damages.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're in the jury room
and a juror says: This wouldn't have happened but for
the wide locomotive; therefore, there should be
liability. What -- and assume the jury has all of the
Federal reports in there and the judge lets them read.
What -- what is there for another juror to say that this
is wrong?
MR. FREDERICK: The negligence theory here,
Justice Kennedy, if I could go back to that, was not
stated in a way that we would subscribe to by -- by Mr.
Rothfeld. Our theory of negligence at trial was
twofold.
One was that these wide-boded locomotives
were not appropriate for the switching exercise that the
train men were doing on that day, and in fact the
supervising engineer said this was the only time that he
was aware in his long experience where these wide-body
locomotives were used for this specific purpose which
required a lot of braking activity.
The second theory of negligence was that Mr.
McBride was put to this purpose without proper training.
He has complained on the day; he was uncomfortable and
he didn't know whether he could operate that locomotive;
and the jury was entitled reasonably to infer that that
poor training was a --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How did any of those
things cause his injury?
MR. FREDERICK: Because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You've used the
formulation negligence played a part in the injury. So
how did those things play a part?
MR. FREDERICK: His -- let's start with his
poor training. There was testimony that a person who
was more skilled in the art of dealing with a wide-boded
locomotive would be able to manipulate the independent
brake with the automatic brake in a way that would not
cause the repetitive stress that Mr. McBride suffered.
And there was further testimony that using a wide-body
locomotive, which is more difficult to manipulate for
the switching operations, and here we're talking about
moving in and off main tracks to couple trains, train
cars so that they can be used for a longer
destination -- that that kind of equipment was not
suited for the purpose.
Mr. McBride's testimony was when he had used
the wide-body locomotive, he had done so on long trips
over long distances that didn't require the same kind of
ready, manipulative braking of the independent brake.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you don't assert that
that's a foreseeable consequence of the negligence of
using a wide-body train?
MR. FREDERICK: It's foreseeable if the
railroad is using a piece of equipment without training
the person.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you don't --
MR. FREDERICK: For a purpose that it's not
ordinarily used for.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You say it doesn't have to
be foreseeable.
MR. FREDERICK: They didn't ask for
foreseeability, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so you -- you conceded
that it ought to be foreseeable.
MR. FREDERICK: What I -- I would say this
Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm trying to see what your
case is because I can't believe you don't believe in
proximate cause. I just think you're -- you're giving a
different definition of it, and I'm trying to figure out
what your definition of it is.
MR. FREDERICK: My definition, what I think
the Court did in Rogers was to try to end the debate
over how confusing the word proximate cause is in these
kind of cases by offering simple and direct instructions
that juries could understand and apply, and that has
been the case over the last 50 years.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do it. I'm still waiting
to hear your instruction, which is supposedly something
other than "but for." Is it just "but for"?
MR. FREDERICK: I would take the words of
Rogers. I think the jury here was properly instructed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: With -- what are the words?
Give me the words.
MR. FREDERICK: The words are on page 10 of
the red brief, Justice Scalia, and it follows the model
form instruction that's used in all the Federal courts,
"defendant caused or contributed to plaintiff's injury
if defendant's negligence played a part no matter how
small in bringing about the injury. The mere fact that
an injury occurred does not necessarily mean that the
injury was caused by negligence."
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think that's "but
for"?
MR. FREDERICK: Whether you think it's "but
for" or not I think is beside the point.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care whether I
think. We've got words here. What do those words mean?
MR. FREDERICK: Those words mean that "but
for" plus a relaxed form of legal cause associating the
negligence in playing a part in produce the injury.
That's how Rogers understood it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Negligence is a given; the
negligence is not what I'm asking about. I'm asking
about causality, and what you have just read is "but
for" cause.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, I would disagree with
that Justice Scalia, and I think the Rogers Court
disagreed with that too, because after Rogers this Court
upheld in Inman a case on a directed verdict where it
concluded after the Rogers instructions had been used
that nonetheless the negligence of the railroad had not
played a part. That's a case involving a drunk driver
who hit a flag man at the site of where the flag man was
operating.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I -- can I go back a
second and perhaps follow up Justice Scalia's question
in a slightly different way? Do you believe a railroad
can be held liable for a harm it could not reasonably
foresee?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Now,
perhaps, we can get to why, under what formulation, if
it didn't know harm was going to happen or could happen.
MR. FREDERICK: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Reasonably foreseeable.
MR. FREDERICK: Yes. I think that the
concept of foreseeability is one that has alternated in
and out of this Court's cases, but let's take the case
of Gallick in 1963, where a fetid pool with vermin and
rats were allowed to live by the railroad's negligence,
and it was believed that an insect was growing -- insect
bodies were growing in that fetid pool, and as a result
of that insect bite, the injured worker's legs had to be
amputated by the effect of this insect bite.
Now, many people would argue -- in fact, the
lower court had concluded -- that it was not reasonably
foreseeable that the railroad's negligence in allowing
that stagnant pool to exist would nonetheless lead to
the injury sustained by the worker.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It might not be
reasonably foreseeable that an amputation would occur,
but it was reasonably foreseeable that some injury to
people would happen as a result of these infected insect
bites, no? That's what the court ultimately said.
MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. But what
the court had also done was to rely on earlier cases in
which it's saying these concepts really are relaxed
because the purpose of FELA is to provide a substitute,
if you will, for workers' compensation, where if you can
establish negligence on the part of the railroad and it
causes, in part, the injury, the railroad will be liable
for that.
And that's why this -- these concepts of
proximate cause really are getting at a different
problem, which is that when these statutes are enacted,
you're trying to guard the defendant's liability against
the entire world. And that's why it makes sense to
impose some kind of restriction for foreseeability or
for directness, because otherwise anybody could be
liable to anybody else. Here, that problem is removed,
because the railroad is the only -- can only be sued,
under FELA, by the employee, and only if its negligence
plays a role in producing that injury.
If I could go back to the words that
Mr. Rothfeld's trial counsel had proposed, the "probable
sequence" word is now not even used anymore in Illinois.
So it would be very odd to think that you would reverse
an instruction here, where the proffered instruction by
the railroad doesn't even State what -- the proximate
cause instruction in the model language.
Now the model language under Illinois calls
for the natural and ordinary course of events. That's
how proximate cause is now done under the Illinois
proposed instructions. And it's hard to know how that
language, Mr. Chief Justice, takes us any different from
the common instruction that all juries are given, to use
their common experience and their common sense in
evaluating the evidence. If what proximate cause now
means under these types of standards is the ordinary
course of events, all we're doing is asking juries to
apply their common sense without introducing the word
"proximate cause," which has been demonstrated to
confuse juries because most of them, you know, many
think that "proximate" means something like estimate
or --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If the other side doesn't
insist on that, the other side -- we'll give you that
one.
MR. FREDERICK: And we're delighted with
that concession, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, suppose a
juror says, We wouldn't -- goes to the judge and says,
We would like to have an explanation of, what does it
mean that the injury results in whole or in part from
the railroad's negligence? What would the judge
respond?
MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I'm not
entirely sure how a trial judge would take a request for
further clarification of this word's -- this Court's
words that clarify the "resulting in whole or in part
from." I'm not aware of any cases where anyone
challenged the use of the Rogers language on the ground
that it wasn't simple and direct and therefore couldn't
be understood.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this jury found it,
though. What -- what would you tell the jury?
MR. FREDERICK: I beg your pardon?
JUSTICE SCALIA: This jury found it unclear
and asks you. What would you say?
MR. FREDERICK: I think -- and I've never
served as a trial judge, but I think my -- my direction
would be to go back and try again based on the words
that are there, because the whole idea behind these
words was to try to end the debate between this Court
and many State courts that simply didn't grasp that FELA
was intended to provide a remedial statute with a
causation element that was a weaker causation element
than in normal negligence cases. And so this Court was
taking dozens of cases under FELA between the 1930's and
the 1950's in which the Court was looking at directed
verdicts by State supreme courts that were overturning
jury verdicts. And the whole idea behind making this
the language of what constitutes a jury case was to
remove the appellate review process from a lot of these
things and to leave these questions up to the common
sense of the jury.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the jury says,
Well, does it mean that but for the negligence, the
injury would not have occurred? Then what would the
trial judge say?
MR. FREDERICK: If the jury asked a
question, I think the judge would write back and say,
No, that's not correct, the words -- please focus on the
words: The negligence playing a part, however small, in
producing the injury. I mean, I'm not aware if juries
get to this but for versus what is a relaxed --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that eliminates
but-for cause, to tell them that negligence plays a
part, no matter how small, in the injury? You think
that eliminates but-for, rather than invites it?
MR. FREDERICK: No, Justice Scalia, our
position is that it is but-for plus a relaxed form of
legal cause that's been well-recognized in the cases and
hasn't produced a problem. Surely the burden is on the
railroad to come up -- I would have thought that if they
wanted to overturn the pattern instructions that have
been used in nearly a half a million cases since Rogers
was handed down, that they would have more than a case
that they cite from one of their amici. I mean, they
don't even cite the Richards case in their main briefs.
And so surely -- you know, we're here to
debate these hypotheticals, I would suppose, but they
don't have any relation to the real world.
JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the jury asks, Is it
sufficient, is it necessary for the injury to be
foreseeable? What does the trial judge say then?
MR. FREDERICK: I think the trial judge
says, No, it is not necessary for it to be foreseeable
in a direct -- if the negligence plays a part, however
small, in producing the injury.
And that's why in cases like the Ferguson
case, which was decided the same day as Rogers -- I
mean, that's a very out-there set of facts, where the
ship steward -- and remember, what you decide here also
applies in the Jones Act for sea workers as well. But
in that case, the Court said it was a jury question,
whether the failure to provide an appropriate to
implement to scoop hardened ice cream from the freezer
on the ship was foreseeable, whether or not the ship's
steward, in serving the ice cream, would reach for a
butcher knife to try to chip away and lead to the
severing of two of his fingers.
I mean, we're talking about a dangerous
situation, Justice Alito. At the time that FELA was
enacted, in a year prior to that, some 12,000 people
died and there were hundreds of thousands of injuries,
and the idea behind the statute was to provide a broad
remedy so that rail workers could be compensated, not
get extra damages like punitive damages, but just
compensated for their injuries. And so the result is
that railmen know they're going to have to go before
juries exercising their common sense, and juries have,
in many, many cases, ruled in favor of the railroads.
And that system ought to be allowed to continue.
If I could go back to one last point, and
that is the idea of statutory stare decisis. We believe
that because Rogers construed the "in whole or in part"
language, it's entitled to statutory stare decisis where
jury instructions have used that language.
And at some level, this case is not too far
from the Hylton case, which was decided in the early
'90s, except the difference is in Hylton, the Court had
dealt with a case from the early 1960s called Parden.
And that case had had many of the underpinnings of -- of
the question there that had been discredited or undercut
by subsequent decisions.
Here, there are no cases since Rogers that
suggest doubt on the general validity of the Rogers
rule. You have the cases that were decided in the
immediate proximity of Rogers; you have Gallick in
63 --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: We have three justices of
this Court that say Rogers is irrelevant because it had
to do only with multiple causes.
MR. FREDERICK: And my answer to that,
Justice Ginsburg, is that after Rogers, the Court
applied the Rogers language to single cause cases. We
have Webb, we have Ferguson, we have Kernan, we have
Gallick, we have the statement in Crane that comparing
the actions of the nonemployee, the -- the explanation
for why the nonemployee has to go to common law is
because there are these special features of FELA, one of
which is no common law proximate cause and the
elimination of contributory negligence and assumption of
the risk.
And then subsequently when the Court in
Ayers and then in Gottshall says very clearly these are
ways that FELA has departed from the common law and from
the other statutes, in Gottshall the Court was very
clear that it is relaxed causation and that this is one
of the departures from normal common law standards. It
would seem odd to hold now that all of a sudden we're
going to talk about common law standards for causation
where the Court over a series of decision over the last
hundred years has knocked out six of the prevailing
versions of proximate cause that were then in vogue.
That would be a very odd way to -- to rule.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Frederick, go back
again and tell me what a -- what a judge would say to a
jury so he or she doesn't say but-for is not, not using
those words, tell me in simple, plain language how a
judge differentiates to a jury the difference between
but-for and this causation. What would a judge say?
MR. FREDERICK: Okay, I would start with the
language in Rogers, and then I would say --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The -- that negligence
played a part in the injury?
MR. FREDERICK: Right. In producing --
producing the injury.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Producing the injury?
MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. And that
part of that played a part -- you know, rests on the
common sense of whether or not a jury thinks that a
particularly improbable set of -- of events is something
that would be within the common experience of someone to
view as --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It sounds like
foreseeability you're talking.
MR. FREDERICK: It's a relaxed form of
foreseeability in much the same way.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said no
foreseeability?
MR. FREDERICK: What I said was that this
Court's cases go back and forth on the idea of
foreseeability and whether or not it's necessary.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want to go back or
forth? Which do you want?
(Laughter.)
MR. FREDERICK: I think it's foreseeable
here in this case that using the wrong equipment with
the wrong training would produce an injury like the one
that my client suffered. And so I would stand on that
basis, and I would further stand on the ground that this
Court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, at -- at -- at least
that, it seems to me, is a jury question.
MR. FREDERICK: That's right, Justice
Kennedy, and the jury here applied the statute the way
it was intended. It found fault with my client, and it
found fault with the railroad and it apportioned damages
accordingly.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but -- but it was
not instructed on foreseeability?
MR. FREDERICK: And they didn't ask for a
foreseeability instruction. So, you know, reversing
when -- when they haven't asked for the correct
statement of the law is not something this Court
ordinarily does.
JUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't Mr. --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They -- they -- they did
ask for proximate cause?
MR. FREDERICK: They defined proximate cause
by saying natural or probable sequence, Justice
Ginsburg. That's how proximate cause was defined in
their words, and the way they defined it didn't include
the word "foreseeability."
JUSTICE SCALIA: That sounds like a good
definition of foreseeable, doesn't it? It's natural and
probable.
MR. FREDERICK: Probable, though, doesn't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Could something be natural
and probable and not foreseeable?
MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, the word
"probable" is more likely than not, which is the
stronger standard, it's intention with the words "in
part" in the statute. Result in part is not something
that is more likely than not. For that reason, we
believe the Court should adhere to the Rogers approach.
It's worked, it's allowed juries to exercise their
common sense without being confused by these elusive
proximate cause formulations.
The other side has failed to identify a
problem, and there's not the slightest reason to think
that any alternative formulation would work any better.
JUSTICE ALITO: Could I just ask you this
factual question? Was it Mr. McBride's theory that his
injury resulted from the repetitive use of the
independent brake or was it that the -- as a result of
the repetitive use his hand fell down and it hit the
independent brake, and that was the cause of the injury?
MR. FREDERICK: I think it's -- both
theories were presented, and they were both based on the
improper equipment that he was asked to use and his
improper -- improper training he had been given, which
are classic jury questions concerning negligence and
causation.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Rothfeld, you have 4 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Your Honor, just a
few quick points. First, although my friend Mr.
Frederick has struggled valiantly, I think that he is
unable to explain how his test is any different from a
"but for" causation.
JUSTICE BREYER:
MR. ROTHFELD:
problem.
JUSTICE BREYER:
MR. ROTHFELD:
common law from --
JUSTICE BREYER:
How about eggshell skull?
That is a different kind of
It is not foreseeable.
It has been -- the rule of
You're just saying, it's
all foreseeable, not foreseeable.
MR. ROTHFELD: No. The question is whether
or not the kind of -- the risk of -- that there would be
an injury follows from the -- the nature of the
misconduct that gives rise to liability in the first
place, and it is -- common law has always recognized
that if you're risking a particular kind of injury, that
someone is going to be hit, you take your victim as your
find them, and that is put -- put in a different basket
of -- of doctrine altogether.
So -- so first, again I -- there is no
alternative to proximate cause, but "but for" cause;
that's been universally recognized as an unacceptable
basis for liability.
Second, if I could return to our snake just
for a moment. It has been recognized that the -- the
nature of the protection that's provided by the tort law
is related to the -- to the risk of injury that gives
rise to liability in the first place. If there -- the
risk of injury is that a defective brake is going to
lead to a derailment or an accident, injury that follows
from that risk is compensable; injury that does not,
like walking along and turning your leg or being bitten
by a snake is in a different category, it's not
predictable and foreseeable or natural in that sense.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why not, if you know
that there are snakes along this route, just like
there's an infected vermin or insects or something else?
I --
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, the question would be
one for the jury if it's properly instructed. And in
fact in the Gallick case, as I think Justice Sotomayor,
you -- you have recognized, the Court said that that was
foreseeable. And the jury -- the issue can be posed to
the jury, the jury can determine whether it is a natural
problem.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
matter of law?
MR. ROTHFELD: No.
that's right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
So it's not that it's a
That -- that's right,
A matter of law, there
was -- there could be no proximate cause. You're
arguing that a jury should determine whether or not they
could anticipate somebody slipping on a slope?
MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's generally
right. I mean, there will be circumstances, as the
restatement says, that -- in which it's so clear that it
is not a -- a probable, natural, foreseeable consequence
of -- of the wrongful conduct, that it should not go to
the jury. And --
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't -- isn't Mr. Frederick
right in saying that asking whether something is
probable is very different from asking whether it's
foreseeable?
MR. ROTHFELD: They -- clearly they are
closely related. I mean the Court in Brady stated
that -- that test, as natural, probable, foreseeable.
If it is natural and probable, it is likely to be
foreseeable. And --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it's probable it's
foreseeable, but it can be foreseeable even though it's
not probable.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, it -- but I think what
probable means in this context it has to be foreseeable,
not simply in the theoretical, I can foresee if I drive
too fast in New York, maybe there will be a lightning
strike -- I mean, I can imagine that. But it has to
have -- pass a certain threshold to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's true, that --
everything that's natural and probable is foreseeable,
but not everything that's foreseeable is natural and
probable, you were requesting a jury instruction that
didn't go as far to help you as was possible, but you
were still requesting a jury instruction that was on the
road.
MR. ROTHFELD: That's -- to me the only
question now here before this Court is whether we are
entitled to a jury instruction that states properly the
nature of the proximate cause test, and if the case goes
back under that standard, then the arguments that have
been suggested by Mr. Frederick can be presented to the
jury. But -- but as you say, Justice Scalia, that's
right; and to the extent that there was anything wrong
with the instruction, we would provide it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: This case go to the jury?
MR. ROTHFELD: I think it would be open to
argue that it's so clear that -- that there was no
proximate cause that it shouldn't; but that's a question
to be posed on remand.
JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry, Mr. Rothfeld, I
didn't understand what you just said, because the
requested jury instruction that -- that you gave was any
cause which in natural or probable sequence produced the
injury. Is that right?
MR. ROTHFELD: That was the requested
instruction.
JUSTICE KAGAN: So that's essentially saying
that the jury has to say it's 51 percent likely to
produce the injury, isn't that right?
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- it was not put in those
terms. I -- I would not think --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it says natural or
probable, and probable means more likely than not, which
is 51 percent.
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- again, it was not --
unpacking those terms, and I would say it does not have
to be -- the answer is -- is no. The jury doesn't
define that it is -- it is necessarily going to be the
outcome, but it has to find that there is some
substantial probability that it will be the outcome,
before liability can attach, would be our -- our
submission.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Your Honor.
