and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan.
Ms. Van Aken.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE VAN AKEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. VAN AKEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
This --
JUSTICE SCALIA:
any further.
(Laughter.)
Ms. Van Aken, before you go
MS. VAN AKEN:  Yes, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your petition for -- for
writ of certiorari -- and it was a petition that had
your name on it, said on -- on the reasons for granting
the petition, this Court should resolve whether and how
the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to arrests
of armed and violent suspects who are disabled.  The
circuits are in conflict on this question.  The question
presented is recurring and important, and Title II of
the ADA does not require accommodations for armed and
violent suspects who are disabled, and that's the issue
on which there is a circuit conflict.
I now look at the Table of Contents of your
petition.  This argument is not made in the petition at
all.  You -- you concede that -- that Title II does
apply even to the arrest of -- of armed and dangerous
suspects.  You just say in this case, "Modification to
Sheehan's arrest would not have eliminated the
significant risk she posed."
There -- there's a technical word for this.
It's called bait-and-switch.  We might well not have
granted this petition had you not listed those reasons.
Are we supposed to appoint somebody else to argue the
point that you asked -- asked us to resolve in the --
in -- in your petition for certiorari?
MS. VAN AKEN:  With respect, Justice Scalia,
San Francisco asked you to resolve the question of
whether and how the ADA applies to the arrest an armed
and -- of an armed and violent individual, and the
answer to that question is it only applies where the
significant threat that the individual poses has been
eliminated.  And --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's -- that's not what
your -- that's not what your petition said.  Title II
does not require accommodations for armed and violent
suspects who are disabled, period, is what it says.  And
that is not the argument you are -- you -- you make in
your -- in -- in your principal brief.
MS. VAN AKEN:  Well, with respect,
Justice Scalia, page 3 of our reply in support of
certiorari -- so still at the certiorari stage -- says
that the issue here is not a fact-intensive
reasonableness question, but instead, it's whether an
armed and violent individual's accommodation is
required.  And the answer to that is no, where the
significant risk hasn't been eliminated.  And our
arguments at the certiorari stage certainly didn't turn
on any claim that the ADA simply --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I -- I
looked at your papers below, and there, there was an
argument as to whether the ADA applied at all to
arrests.  And nowhere do you raise the direct threat
argument; nowhere do you raise -- raise below the risk
argument.  It was a pure legal question, the one I
thought we were going to answer.
But on appeal, you're now using the words
"direct threat" and -- and "risk."  What are we supposed
to do with this?
MS. VAN AKEN:  Justice Sotomayor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Weâ€™re supposed to
change the -- the nature of the case and perhaps reverse
the Ninth Circuit on an argument that was never
presented to it?
MS. VAN AKEN:  I -- I disagree, Your Honor.
In the Ninth Circuit, San Francisco argued that the --
the Ninth Circuit should adopt essentially the Fifth
Circuit's rule, that where there are exigent
circumstances, that there is no requirement of
accommodation.  There was no argument that the ADA just
has nothing to do with arrests.  It's that in exigent
arrests, like the Fifth Circuit said in Hainze, then you
don't -- there's not a reasonable accommodation.  No
accommodation is reasonable.
So in a sense, the ADA doesn't apply, but
that's because of the exigency as the Fifth Circuit said
in Hainze, and that was the conflict that we asked this
Court to take the case to resolve.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Before we get to the
question that you have briefed and the question that the
Solicitor General has briefed, there is another question
that logically comes first.  The statute, 42 U.S.C.
12132, says, "No qualified individual with a disability
shall, by reason of such disability, be subjected to
discrimination by any such entity."  That's the relevant
statutory provision, isn't it?
MS. VAN AKEN:  Yes, Justice.  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So all we have
there is discrimination.  In the -- is there any
provision of the ADA that defines what is meant by
discrimination in that context?  Not in the employment
context, in that context.
MS. VAN AKEN:  Right.  Congress's findings
included a statement that discrimination includes a
failure to make modifications in some circumstances.  So
we understand discrimination to include a failure to
modify a government program --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Where does that
appear?  Is that in the statute?
MS. VAN AKEN:  It's -- it's 12101(a)(5),
Your Honor. 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(5).
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
MS. VAN AKEN:  And that's a finding that
discrimination includes not making an accommodation.
And this Court has recognized that accommodation is part
of the discrimination analysis.  In -- in Olmstead, for
instance, the Court said that Congress had a broad view
of what discrimination meant.
So let -- let me return to my original
point, which was that -- that the case is about an
entry, and police officers here sought to reenter a
private home of a mentally ill woman who had just --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, before you get to
that, I -- I'm still not entirely satisfied with your
answer about discrimination.  We have to answer that
question before we get to the arguments that you make
and that the United States makes based on regulations
that have been issued pursuant to the statute.
If discrimination means what it means in
ordinary parlance, which means treating people
differently, then there would be no basis for those
regulations.  But nobody's briefed this other issue,
this threshold issue.  Now, maybe you're right.  But it
hadn't been briefed.
MS. VAN AKEN:  Well, I -- I think
discrimination includes the failure to make an
accommodation where it's reasonable to do so, and I base
that on the findings, as I mentioned.  I base that on
the regulations, which this Court said in -- in Bragdon
were entitled to deference, at least in the -- the
public accommodations context.  Congress has recognized
the reasonable accommodation duty in 42 U.S.C. 12206,
which -- which was subsequently enacted but mentions
accommodations.
And I also think it -- it sort of follows
from this context.  The public service here is providing
an injury-free arrest to the extent possible.
Ms. Sheehan alleges that because of her disability, she
wasn't able to take advantage of that public service to
the extent other people would have been able to, but if
we had provided her an accommodation, then she would
have been able to.  Now, we -- we disagree with that
factually, of course.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  What -- what is
the public service that she could not --
MS. VAN AKEN:  An injury-free arrest.  An
arrest with a minimum of -- of force.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is a public service?
MS. VAN AKEN:  It's an activity, Justice
Scalia.  And -- and it's an activity in the same sense
that imprisoning someone is a public activity, and this
Court said in -- in Yeskey that -- that that indeed was.
And so therefore, the ADA applied.
The service at issue here, the activity at
issue here is an arrest, but the circuits are unified
that Title II applies to arrest.  Where they're divided
is how --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's call it an activity
instead of a service.
MS. VAN AKEN:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  Let's
call it an activity.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I -- I have another
preliminary question.
The ADA does not apply to the individual
officers; right?  It applies to the entity.
MS. VAN AKEN:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So this -- the scenario
we presented are actions taken on the spot by two
officers.  Is -- what is the entity liability?  Is this
a vicarious liability?
MS. VAN AKEN:  It's -- it's a respondeat
superior type of liability, and -- and I believe -- it's
certainly clear in the Ninth Circuit that the city is
liable for the individual actions of its officers.  The
Monell doctrine only applies in the context of 42 U.S.C.
1983.
So we accept for purposes here that where
the officers are engaged in purposeful conduct on behalf
of the entity that the entity is liable for -- for
their --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you're not making the
argument that the entity would be liable for a pattern
or practice of discrimination, but not what the officer
on the beat does?
MS. VAN AKEN:  No.  I'm not making that
argument.  I'm not making that argument.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And while we are talking
about questions that are not strictly speaking in the
case --
(Laughter.)
MS. VAN AKEN:  Yes, Justice Kagan.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What is your view of when
you are liable for monetary damages?  What is the
standard on that?
MS. VAN AKEN:  Right.  So the -- the ADA
adopts the Rehabilitations Act remedies, which in turn
adopts the Title VI remedies, so the city is liable in
damages when it has engaged in intentional conduct.  And
the Ninth Circuit has expanded that to include
deliberate indifference as well.  And -- and we think
that here if the conduct is purposeful, if the officers
are intentionally making an arrest rather than
refraining from making an arrest in a -- in the moment,
then that conduct is purposeful for purposes of the
remedy discussion.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  As long as they are
intentionally making the arrest, do you think that that
meets the standards that --
MS. VAN AKEN:  I think if they are on notice
that there's -- there might be an occasion to provide an
accommodation, and they nonetheless make the arrest,
then that meets the standard, I believe.  I think that's
the case in the Ninth Circuit.  It's County of Duvall v.
Kitsap --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It isn't that the
institution must be purposeful, that it must be a policy
of the institution?  It's enough if the actor, the
officer in question, acted purposefully?
MS. VAN AKEN:  Well, that was certainly the
assumption of the Ninth Circuit here, Justice Scalia.
That -- that the entire liability issue in this case
turns on whether the officers failed to make a
reasonable accommodation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't -- you don't
challenge that?  You think that --
MS. VAN AKEN:  Not in this case.  We don't
challenge that in this case.  That's a -- that's a rule
in the Ninth Circuit.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you -- you want us to
assume that Title II applies, and then to say that in
this case, however, because of this particular
individual's behavior, there was an exemption from that
normal application of Title II.  And then we will decide
in some future case whether it's true that Title II
applies at all; right?  That's --
MS. VAN AKEN:  I think Title II applies
here.  If -- I think the Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You didn't say so in
your -- in your petition.
MS. VAN AKEN:  I respectfully disagree,
Justice Scalia.  We argued about how Title II applies to
this case, and we argued that it did not apply -- it did
not create a duty here because of the degree of
exigency.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Title II of the ADA does
not require accommodations for armed and violent
suspects who are disabled.
MS. VAN AKEN:  Correct.  Now, that is not an
argument --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're not -- you're not
arguing that here.  You are saying in the circumstances
of this case, is all you're saying.
MS. VAN AKEN:  I am arguing that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it -- is it enough that
the individual was armed and dangerous?  Is that alone
enough?
MS. VAN AKEN:  Yes.  That is enough because
the individual was armed and dangerous.  If there -- if
the individual had been disarmed, Title II would create
an obligation.  If the individual were not dangerous,
Title II would create an obligation.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what about this case?
Suppose that there is an armed and dangerous person who
the officer knows is deaf, and the officer says put your
hands up or Iâ€™ll shoot.
MS. VAN AKEN:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, of course, the deaf
person doesn't put his hands up and the officer shoots.
Is that -- I guess you are saying that the ADA has
nothing to do with that case.
MS. VAN AKEN:  I -- if the person is
dangerous in that moment and it is necessary to shoot to
protect public safety such as if the armed and violent
deaf individual is raising a gun at the officer, then,
yes, the ADA --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's not what you
answered to me.  You said if the individual is armed and
dangerous -- actually it should be armed and violent,
that -- now you are saying that is not enough.
This individual was armed and violent, and
you say it's not enough.  It depends on the
circumstances.  Now, which do you want us to hold?
MS. VAN AKEN:  Dangerous, Justice Scalia.
Dangerous.  If the individual presents a significant
threat, then no accommodation is required.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.
MS. VAN AKEN:  Any accommodation --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And there is a circuit
conflict on that point; isn't there?
MS. VAN AKEN:  I believe there is, Justice
Scalia, because the Fifth Circuit in Hainze said that
anytime there is exigent circumstances, you just don't
look to the ADA.  And what the Ninth Circuit has really
done here, in our view, has given almost no weight to
the exigency of the circumstances.
And I think there's two ways the Court can
resolve this case.  One is to hold the direct threat
regulation applies to situations like this one because
the significant risk had not been eliminated here, and
therefore --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where was that in your
brief?
MS. VAN AKEN:  I'm sorry.  Which brief?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where was -- the brief
below it, to the circuit court.  Where did you use the
words direct threat and parrot the statute?
MS. VAN AKEN:  Yes --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because you're -- you're
not parroting the statute.  The statute says, in
determining whether an individual possesses a direct
threat, a public entity must make an individualized
assessment based on reasonable judgment that relies on
current medical damage or on the best available
objective evidence to ascertain the nature, duration,
and severity of the risk, the probability that the
potential injury will occur, and whether reasonable
modifications will mitigate the risk.
MS. VAN AKEN:  That is from the regulation,
Justice Sotomayor.  We did not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That is the regulation.
MS. VAN AKEN:  -- cite the regulation to
the -- to the Ninth Circuit.  What we cited was Hainze,
and Hainze's analysis that in exigent circumstances you
don't provide an accommodation.  Now, we certainly think
that at least where the exigent circumstances rise to
the level that they did here, you don't provide an
accommodation.  And the reason for that is that the
fundamental government activity here is protecting
public safety.
And so in that situation -- in a situation
like this one, time is of the essence, and so to
delay -- to delay an arrest as an accommodation where
time is of the essence isn't a reasonable accommodation
as a matter of law.  And my argument to this Court is
that because officers are making risk judgments --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry,
what -- I -- I -- let's assume certain facts.
MS. VAN AKEN:  Okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  Contrary to
what you're -- I will wait for your reply.
MS. VAN AKEN:  I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I finish the
question?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is no exit
possible, and the police officers knew that.
MS. VAN AKEN:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The police officers knew
that there was no way to escape from that apartment.
They knew that the building was empty.  Could you still
defend their decision to go in given that they could
have waited and tried to talk her out?
MS. VAN AKEN:  So if the building -- if they
knew the building was empty, unlike here, and if they
knew there was no exit, unlike here, we still think
there would be a question about whether she had other
weapons in the room and could be preparing some kind of
ambush or some kind of barricade, and that's something
that the officers here testified they were concerned
about it, page 198 and one 199 of the Joint Appendix.
So what they thought was necessary was to get that door
open so that they could see what Ms. Sheehan was doing,
so they could see if she were preparing an ambush or
barricade.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's different than
what they did however.
MS. VAN AKEN:  Well--
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They opened the door,
and they rushed in and pepper sprayed her.  They -- they
weren't just opening the door to see if she had a gun or
other instruments of danger.
MS. VAN AKEN:  Justice Sotomayor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So let's -- let's assume
my hypothetical.  Doesn't -- doesn't this require them,
if it doesn't change the nature of their service,
protecting the public, to wait for their backup and to
wait for the crisis intervention team?
MS. VAN AKEN:  If they knew there was no
danger from not opening the door, then, yes, that could
be a reasonable accommodation.  They didn't know that
here.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't that a jury
fact?
MS. VAN AKEN:  I'm sorry --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why isn't that a jury
fact?
MS. VAN AKEN:  It's not a jury fact because
no reasonable jury could conclude that there was no
significant danger here.  I -- the -- what the officers
were doing was preventing a danger that they had a
reasonable basis to believe existed.  They were doing
that by opening a door.  With respect, they didn't rush
in.  It was Ms. Sheehan who rushed out and crossed the
threshold.  What they did is open the door prepared with
pepper spray to use it, and then prepared to use their
firearms that they needed to, and that's unfortunately
what they needed to do.
I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time
for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Gershengorn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING VACATUR IN PART AND REVERSAL IN PART
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The ADA provides individuals with
disabilities with important rights in their interactions
with the police, including arrest.  However, under the
circumstances here, the Ninth Circuit applied the wrong
standard when it sent to the jury both the ADA claim and
the Fourth Amendment claim, because it gave insufficient
weight to the safety risks the officers faced when they
confronted an individual who was mentally ill and armed
and violent.
I would like to have touch base first on the
two preliminary -- two of the preliminary questions that
the Court has identified.  First, it is clear that the
ADA applies to arrests.  The ADA applies broadly to any
department or agency of the local Government, that
includes the police, and it applies broadly to
activities, services, and programs which also includes
arrests.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There is no circuit
conflict on that point?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  There is no circuit
conflict since Yeskey that it applies to arrests, Your
Honor, so that is correct.  And we think that that makes
--
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, at the common
law, it was -- it was clear that statutes normally did
not apply to the police, for instance, even though the
speeding law does not have an exemption for police
vehicles, a policeman could speed.  It was just assumed
that normal criminal offenses did not apply to a
policeman acting within the scope of his duties.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  But, Your Honor, the ADA,
of course, is not a criminal statute, and it was an
intent by Congress to apply quite broadly, as this Court
recognized in Yeskey, it applies to State prisons.  The
text of the statute doesn't have any exemption at all
for police activities --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I'm not talking about
prisons.  I'm just talking about enforcing the law.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, but I do think
that, again, the statute has no exceptions, and this
Court -- the lower courts are in agreement, and it's
consistent with the Justice Department guidance, and
there is a good reason for that.  It's along the lines
of Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that things like
providing an interpreter during the arrest of a deaf
individual, as this Court, in the case that was before
this Court about a decade ago in Gorman, providing
transportation for a wheelchair bound individual to the
police station, for conducting sobriety tests, have a
walk the line test for someone with physical
disabilities, those are the core kinds of things that
the ADA is designed to get at.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And do you also agree
with Ms. Van Aken that there is vicarious liability,
because the ADA operates against entities, not
individuals, not officers.  So do you also accept that
there is vicarious liability, rather than the
enterprise, the entity would be liable if it had a
pattern or practice.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  We do believe that,
Justice Ginsburg, that there is the effect -- the
effectively respondeat superior liability much of the
time will only be for injunctive relief, precisely
because in the absence of an intentional harm, damages
would not be available.  But, yes, we do believe that
there is the equivalent of respondeat superior
liability.  Of course, none of that has been briefed in
this case, but if I could just touch on one more issue
that hasn't been briefed in this case that the Court
should not resolve is Justice Alito's question about
reasonable accommodation.
This Court said in Tennessee v. Lane, both
in Justice Stevens' majority opinion, and in Chief
Rehnquist's dissent that reasonable accommodation was
required by Title II of the ADA.  That makes sense.
Titles I, II, III, and the Rehab Act all require
reasonable accommodation.  Titles I and III do so
expressly in 21.112 and Section 21.182.  And Title II
does it by reference.  What Title II is it broadly
defines discrimination.  And then in Section 12.201, the
Congress provided that the regulations and provisions --
the protections in Title II shall be the same or no less
than the protections in the Rehab Act, including the
regulations in the Rehab Act.  So I think it's clear
that reasonable accommodation occurs -- is required by
Title --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It does seem to me that the
dynamics are different in the arrest context.  Now,
here, I guess the officers had reason to know that this
individual had a disability, but what happens if police
officers have to arrest somebody out on the street that
seems to be behaving in an unusual fashion.  How can
they determine whether that person has a disability, it
may be someone who is schizophrenic and isn't taking his
or her medications, or it might be somebody who does not
have a mental illness, but has taken some kind of
controlled substance, how do they make those
determinations on the spot when they're arresting
someone.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, the ADA applies when
you know or believe that the person has a disability,
including mental illness.  So in some of the
hypotheticals that Your Honor just poses, the ADA would
not apply.  But, of course, in this case, they did, as
Your Honor says, they did know.  And in fact, the whole
purpose of the entry was to address a problem of mental
illness.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But in the case I posited,
there would be an issue about whether the officers
should have known that this person was behaving
bizarrely, had a mental illness?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  We don't believe that
should have known is the standard in the ADA.  So it's
not a should have known standard with respect to the
disability.
With respect to how the Court should
approach this, and the question that we understand to
presented and whether it should adopt the Hainze
approach.  We have proposed for the Court that it apply
the Barnett standard.  The root of that standard is the
recognition that in the mine run of cases like this,
with an armed and violent individual, it would be a
great danger to the officers or to the public, and short
time.  And so consistent with the Justice Department
guidelines, which say the officers' priority is to
stabilize the situation, and I think with the instincts
of the courts of appeals, we think the right way to
operationalize that instinct and map it onto this
Court's precedent is through a Barnett standard, which
is to recognize that it will very rarely be the case
that an accommodation is needed.
So when might one be needed under Barnett?
Well, it goes, I think, to Justice Sotomayor's hypo with
one tweak.  It's our view that the rare occasions when
an accommodation would be needed involves something like
when it's contained and visible.  So a threat that you
knew there was no opportunity for escape and you could
see the individual, perhaps if there was a security
camera in Ms. Sheehan's room, or another example, if you
had a mentally ill individual with a knife cornered in
an alley, so there was possibility of escape and the
officers could retreat.  We think those might be the
rare situations that a reasonable accommodation would be
needed.  The reason for that is a reasonable
accommodation is not -- a reasonable modification is not
needed, in our view, when it presents significant safety
risks to the officer or the public.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about saying it is
never reasonable to accommodate somebody who is armed
and violent?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, that is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That seems to me a fairly
sensible statement.  It is never reasonable to
accommodate somebody who is armed and violent, period.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is what some courts
have held.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  The Fifth Circuit, I
believe, is the only court to have held that.  We don't
think that that's the right standard, although we think
their instinct there is a lot closer than what the Ninth
Circuit has done.  We don't think it's right for two --
one legal reason and one sort of practical reason.  The
legal reason is this Court has avoided generally in the
context of reasonableness the sort of bright line rules
that the Fifth Circuit has articulated.  So that is the
first reason.  With respect to the practical
consequences, I think it does get to my response to
Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, but I don't
accept that.  That's not a bright line rule.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  I think if you say it
doesn't apply at all --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't apply -- it
doesn't apply in one particular circumstance, where the
person is armed and violent.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, we think that
a -- sort of one notch back from that is actually the
right approach, that it captures the idea that Your
Honor is articulating, and that drove the Fifth Circuit,
but does it without the absolute rule, which is, I
think, how many of the other circuits, other than the
Ninth Circuit, are applying it.  They recognize that
exigency is very, very important, but there will be
times when the exigency is sort of in an unstable
equilibrium, where the officers may have an obligation
to back off.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you are asking for a
remand -- you say most of the time officers can go
ahead.  But there may be some times when not.
What is there in the fact picture here that
would warrant a remand?  Remand to determine what?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, we do
think a remand is appropriate, but we will say we're not
-- we haven't seen anything in the record that would
create that special circumstances.  But in fairness to
plaintiffs, because it is a different standard than the
one that they faced below, and they prevailed below, we
think they should have a chance to go through the
extensive record and make the arguments to the Ninth
Circuit.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Gershengorn, if I can
just get your understanding.  What are the special
circumstances that we're reserving here?  What is the
reason for not adopting Justice -- the Fifth Circuit
rule?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Because I think there will
be times when the exigency is --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Tell me what those facts
are.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  When you -- a paradigmatic
case is when it is -- it's visible -- when the suspect
is visible and contained.  So in other words, you can be
assured that there is no additional risk from waiting,
and that you can be assured that there is no danger to
the public.  So for example, had there been a clear door
into Ms. Sheehan's room so they could see what she was
doing, if she was sort of huddled in the corner, that
might be a situation in which a reasonable modification
was appropriate, even though the situation was not
overcontained in that sense, had she made a break for
the window, had she made a move for another weapon, they
could have done something about it.
THE COURT:  Well, but I suppose suicide is
always a concern in a case like that, right?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, there is a
risk of danger to self, and the officers are allowed to
take that into account.  We think that in a situation in
which you can see her, that that would be a situation in
which there were an agreement for a reasonable
modification, but we recognize that harm to self is
something that the officers can take into --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think the standard you
just proposed gives no guidance at all to an officer
faced with a violent -- with a violent person.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, may I answer?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I do think it
gives guidance in this sense.  It says that absent a
situation in which you have -- in which you can have
some confidence that there is no risk to the public, you
don't have to worry about a reasonable modification.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Feldman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD FELDMAN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. FELDMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The principal dispute in this case is a
factual one, not a legal dispute.  It's a factual
dispute.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.  I don't know why
we took the case.
MR. FELDMAN:  And I agree entirely with that
comment, Justice Scalia.  And that's why, in our brief,
we commented that perhaps this is an appropriate
instance where the Court would dismiss as improvidently
granted.
The Hainze discussion is very different than
what's being proposed here.  Hainze got it wrong.  What
Hainze said was that any time there's a -- a
confrontation that's out in the open, we just won't
apply the ADA.  But one of the powers of the ADA, one of
the strengths is the regulatory framework is so
comprehensive.  And so we have the direct threat
exception, the direct threat defense, Section 139 of the
ADA regs.  And it addresses all of the issues that are
before this Court.
The first and the primary consideration is,
was there or wasn't there a substantial risk to the
public.  And critically, it doesn't talk about risks to
the individual.  That's not within the ADA regulations.
We're just talking about, is there a risk to the public.
And that's the disputed issue in this case.  That's the
issue that the Ninth Circuit set down.
But there's another part to Section 139, and
that's whether this -- that if there is a significant
risk, if you can mitigate that risk with reasonable
accommodations.  And that's what Lou Reiter talks about
in his report, is the various ways that we mitigate a
risk when we're dealing with someone who is mentally
disabled.
But let's go back to the risks, because,
Justice Sotomayor, I think you hit the nail on the head.
There was no public risk here.  And the reason for that
is because she was in her room, and she had made clear
she wanted to be left alone.  She didn't chase after
these officers.  She closed the door.  The officers had
climbed up two flights of stairs to get to her front
door.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the actual dispute
was that Hodge, the social worker, claims he told them
that this was a second-floor apartment, and there was no
way to leave, and that the building had been evacuated.
MR. FELDMAN:  Exactly.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So there's a factual
dispute between what they say and the witness says.
MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  And the only time that
we get beyond the -- the record, I guess -- one of the
arguments that you heard from Ms. Van Aken about, well,
she might have had a gun, she might have had a
hostage --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  She might have
wanted to commit suicide --
MR. FELDMAN:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- which is a
reason -- I mean, the officers did not go in there to
shoot her.  They used the pepper spray first.  Why isn't
that a sufficient justification?
MR. FELDMAN:  Two reasons, Your Honor.
First of all, the -- the -- the reply brief makes very
clear that when they went in the second time, it wasn't
to help her.  It was to apprehend her.  And the second
is that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm not sure I
understand that distinction.  If you think she's going
to harm herself, apprehending her prevents that.
MR. FELDMAN:  Shooting and killing her is
not an efficacious way to prevent --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I understand
the point.  And it's -- it's a clever point to make,
except, as I said earlier, they used pepper spray the
first time.  And it was only when the pepper spray was
ineffective that they had a necessity of taking armed
action.
MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  To get back to your
questions, the regulations that have been adopted in
ADA, the Department of Justice made a determination that
danger to self was not a consideration under the --
under the direct threat defense to the ADA.  That was a
decision that the Department of Justice made.  So that
determination is not relevant here, but that, too, was
hotly disputed.
Remember that Hodge, when he filled out the
form, he checked "greatly disabled."  He checked "danger
to others."  He did not check "danger to self."  And
what he testified to was that he did not give these
officers any reason to believe that she was a danger to
herself.  Greatly disabled --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I
understand -- I understand the factual dispute in this
case.  But is your position that based on the Justice
regulations, that danger to self is never a
justification for approaching and trying to apprehend
and subdue somebody in this situation?
MR. FELDMAN:  Under the ADA, that's clear.
And the reason for that is the ADA contemplates
providing reasonable accommodations as a way of avoiding
discrimination.  It would be inconsistent with the ADA
if officers were to, as in this case, pepper spray, take
people into custody as a way of preventing them from
doing harm to themselves.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know why you
wouldn't think the pepper spray, instead of the weapons,
in the first instance wasn't a reasonable accommodation.
MR. FELDMAN:  If they had gone in with
pepper spray, it might be a very different case.  But
they went in with pepper spray with their guns
unholstered.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just -- just to make
clear --
MR. FELDMAN:  And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- you say danger to --
to â€“ to the self is -- is not a reason for apprehending
the person?
MR. FELDMAN:  Not under the -- it's not a
reason -- let me be clear.  It is not a reason for
failing to accommodate under the ADA.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or at least trying to.
MR. FELDMAN:  Correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  She had called for
backup, and she had called for the CIT, correct?
MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  Right.  Danger to self
may present issues under the Fourth Amendment, but
that's not our case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why should that be?  I -- I
can't imagine why that should be.  I mean, if you have a
person that you know is mentally unstable and they're --
they're about to kill themselves, you -- you -- you have
to back off and say, well, you know, this is not -- not
something that requires accommodation.
MR. FELDMAN:  And that's the determination
that the Department of Justice made --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't care.  That doesn't
make sense.
MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I -- I can't tell you,
Your Honor, that it does or doesn't make sense.  I can
only tell you that that's the law under the ADA.  And
everybody -- all the parties here have relied on
Section 139, because it's what governs this issue.  And
it doesn't ask the police officers whether or not
somebody is a harm to their self.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this case is about
danger to the police -- police officers.  This is --
this is a case where a social worker says, she
threatened to kill me.
MR. FELDMAN:  Yeah.  And I think that's a
very good point.  I -- I don't think this Court has to
reach out and address what might or might not be the law
in a situation involving someone who might be a threat
or a harm to themselves.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. -- Mr. Feldman, do you
agree with the Solicitor General's standard here, and
you just disagree on the facts, or do you disagree with
the Solicitor General's standard?
MR. FELDMAN:  No.  We disagree very
strenuously with any notion that a special circumstances
test should apply here.
Looking at the U.S. Airways case, the Court
adopted that test for very good reasons.  And it was
because, in that case, there was a direct conflict
between the proposed accommodation and the employer's
seniority rules.  So in that circumstance, the Court
added a burden to the plaintiff.
That isn't our case.  In our case, we have
symmetry between the proposed accommodation, on the one
hand, and the way that San Francisco trains its officers
and also universally accepted methods for dealing with
mentally disabled individuals.  So we're not in a
situation where we need to adopt a special circumstances
test.  And as was noted earlier, I don't know what it
means, and I don't know how a police officer can
possibly figure that out.
What I said earlier about the direct threat
exception, and how powerful it is and how useful it is,
that's what's in the regulation.  And that's language
that police officers understand because they are doing
that already in the Fourth Amendment.  Is there a direct
threat here?  Can it be mitigated through reasonable
accommodations?  Police officers aren't trained, and I
don't know that they ever would be, to figure out what a
special circumstance is.
So we have a regulation.  It's been adopted
through notice and comment rulemaking.  It's expressed
in language that police officers can understand.  It's
been applied by the lower courts.  This just isn't a
case in which we should be adopting a special
circumstances test, particularly since it wasn't
addressed below.  The Ninth Circuit didn't address any
special circumstance test.  And from what I know, no
court in this country has ever decided whether to adopt
that special circumstance test.  So I think that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what did -- I
thought that the government said if somebody is armed
and dangerous, the presumption is no modifications are
required.
MR. FELDMAN:  Under Hainze, if a person is
armed and dangerous, then the ADA doesn't apply.
That's a different issue that, as Justice
Scalia has mentioned, hasn't been raised here.  The
argument that the Government is making, as I understand
it, is that if somebody is armed and dangerous, then
there is a presumption that the direct threat exception
is satisfied.  And that's the only way to see that
argument and -- and have it make sense in the
regulatory --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I have a hard time
actually understanding if there's much of a difference
between the reg and the Government's special
circumstance, because the ADA, as a matter of course,
doesn't say you have to change your procedures unless a
reasonable accommodation can reduce the risk or can
eliminate the risk.  So what's the difference between
that and special circumstance?
MR. FELDMAN:  The -- the Government is
putting their thumb on the scale.  That's the
difference.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There I -- I agree with
you.  Any time we start creating tests, I think it
complicates things when you just go by the language.
The issue always for the jury is, could they have
eliminated this risk.
MR. FELDMAN:  And I agree with that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That is what the
statute -- that's what the reg says.
MR. FELDMAN:  Right, right.  But it should
not be necessary for a plaintiff in an ADA case to also
have to show that there were special circumstances.  All
the plaintiff needs to show is what the reasonable
accommodations would be to prevent discrimination, and
the -- the burden then shifts to the defendant to make
the showing of direct threat, if that's the defense that
the defendant wants to assert.  And throwing the special
circumstances test in the middle of that, it -- it
violates and -- and undermines the regulatory framework.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but I think the idea
of the government's test, Mr. Feldman, is this is an
extraordinary circumstance in which the government is
facing somebody who has a weapon, somebody who may be
violent at any time, and that we shouldn't turn every
case into an inquiry about, was this the absolute best
thing that the police could have done.  You know,
there's -- there's a lot of uncertainty in these
situations, and some reason to give the police officers
who have to deal with them the benefit of the doubt.
MR. FELDMAN:  Well, if -- if you see it that
way, Your Honor, then I think we're back to where we
started, and the point that Justice Sotomayor was
making, there wasn't a threat here.  So if we're going
to have a special circumstances test --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  But then that's,
again, just the question of does this meet the special
circumstances or does it not meet the special
circumstances?  I guess what I was trying to sort of
figure out was the reason why you object to the
government's test in the first instance.
MR. FELDMAN:  I think the best way to put it
is that they put their thumb on the scale, and it's a
scale that has been carefully balanced in the
regulations and the statute, and there isn't any reason
for this Court to start changing what the regulatory
framework is.  It's not an issue that the lower courts
have had an opportunity to develop.  I don't know what
circumstances it might or might apply in.  It may be
very well an issue that the Petitioners here can raise
in the district court on summary judgment, and an issue
that this Court can decide at a later date.  But the
issue before the Court today is really just this fact
issue that I started with, which is, was there a direct
threat here.  And all of the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what -- if you
were giving the two-sentence guidance in the -- in the
education course to the police about what to do in a
situation where they confront somebody who is mentally
unstable, what would you tell them to do?
MR. FELDMAN:  If the direct threat defense
is not satisfied, then you must accommodate that
individual's disability.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that doesn't
give -- I mean, that throws a lot of legal terms at
them.  I mean, in terms of their actual on-the-ground
guidance, can you do better than saying you must
accommodate the disability?
MR. FELDMAN:  Well, they're trained in
accommodation techniques, so I don't think that's really
the issue.  There's no dispute that the way to interact
with mentally disabled individuals is through
communication and time.  Police officers know that, and
they're trained that way.  I think the difficulty that
the Solicitor General and the Petitioners are
identifying is that these are difficult circumstances
and potentially dangerous.
But that's what the direct threat defense
governs.  And to put English onto the direct threat
defense, the police officers have to be asking
themselves, as I think they already do under Graham v.
Connor, is there an immediate threat to the public, and
is that a threat that we can eliminate somehow?
And if it can be eliminated by, for example,
here leaving the door closed, bringing in a negotiator,
giving Sheehan time to deescalate, that entire risk that
the officers here confronted was avoidable.  And one of
the things that Section 139 asks is what is the
likelihood of -- of -- of the threat, and -- and what is
the extent of the threat?  Because whatever the risks of
de-escalation here, the course that these officers picked
led to the certainty of a violent confrontation with a
mentally ill and agitated woman who is standing behind
this door with a knife.  And they knew that when they
went in with their pepper spray.
It was reasonably foreseeable that when they
went in with their pepper spray, and they sprayed
Ms. Sheehan, because she was going to still be there
with a knife, the stage had been set, it was reasonably
foreseeable that they would need to shoot her.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Gee, I -- I would -- I
would have thought it was foreseeable that the pepper
spray would disable her.
MR. FELDMAN:  If she wasn't --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that what pepper
spray is supposed to do.
MR. FELDMAN:  It is.  And -- and the
Ninth --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was this defective pepper
spray?  What was -- what was the matter here?
MR. FELDMAN:  The Ninth Circuit has been
quite good about explaining that nonlethal force does
not work in the intended way when we're dealing with
mentally disabled individuals.
If I get shot with pepper spray, I'm on the
ground dropping whatever knives I have, but when
mentally ill individuals get shot with pepper spray,
they don't always process it the same way.  Sometimes
they see that as a threat, and sometimes they act
irrationally.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What would you say to
officers who encounter a person on the street about
determining whether the person has a disability?
MR. FELDMAN:  I think that's a difficult
issue that isn't presented here, but police officers are
trained to recognize disabilities.  And the -- the
learning materials that Lou Reiter discusses in his
report include how to identify somebody who is of
diminished capacity or mentally disabled.  Again, that's
not our case.  These officers knew that she was disabled
because they weren't called to the scene to arrest her,
they were called to the scene --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I understand it's not this
case, but our decision would have implications in other
contexts.  So you would tell the officers, well, you
have to determine whether this person is substantially
limited in a major life activity, and if so, that person
has a disability, what would you do?
MR. FELDMAN:  I would say that if you know,
or can reasonably determine that an individual is
suffering from a mental disability, then the ADA
reasonable accommodation requirements apply.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is -- is being high on
drugs a mental disability?
MR. FELDMAN:  I think it would depend on why
somebody is high on drugs.  They -- they may --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He's high on drugs because
he took drugs.
MR. FELDMAN:  Well, if it was a choice to
take drugs --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
MR. FELDMAN:  -- and it was unrelated to a
mental disability --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. FELDMAN:  -- then -- then I think it
would not be a mental disability.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Gershengorn said that
the ADA was only triggered when the officer knew there
was a disability.  Do you disagree with that from your
answer to Justice Alito?
MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I agree with Ms. Van Aken
that it's either knew or should have known.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And presumably,
there's no way to tell if there's somebody you come upon
on the street who's exhibiting signs of being on -- on
drugs, whether that is because of prescription
medication or illicit drugs.
MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I think that's right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And -- but they --
but they have to be treated differently.
MR. FELDMAN:  They do.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Why?
MR. FELDMAN:  Well, because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If the -- if the danger
is present, right?  All right?  Why do they have to be
treated differently?  One -- one would assume that if
someone's dangerous and violent, and there's no way to
modify dealing with them, does it matter whether they're
disabled or not or what the cause is or not?  The issue
is, don't resort to violence automatically if there's a
way to mitigate the risk.  Isn't that the answer?
Now, whether you'll be liable for potential
damages or an injunction or anything else, that depends
on whether you knew the person was disabled.  That's a
different issue altogether.
MR. FELDMAN:  I agree with -- with what you
said.  The difference is whether there's liability under
the ADA.  That turns on whether the officer knew or
should have known that the individual was disabled.  The
Fourth Amendment issues, you're absolutely right.  When
an officer confronts somebody who is of diminished
capacity for whatever reason, the officer has to use
reasonable force.  And -- and in a totality of the
circumstances test, the diminished capacity is one of
those circumstances.  And it's not just for the
protection --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you know about it.
MR. FELDMAN:  Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But if you don't, and
whatever the cause is, if the person's violent and
there's no way to mitigate the risk, it doesn't matter
whether they're disabled or not.
MR. FELDMAN:  Correct, because of Section
139.  And again, that's the strength of Section 139 is
it tells the police officers exactly what they need to
know.
So we have a very robust regulatory
framework and it comes back down to this very simple
issue of whether there was a risk.  And things like
guns, there is no evidence of any guns; things like
hostages, there was no evidence of any hostages.  The
officers were able to look into her apartment.  They
didn't see hostages.  Hodge was in her apartment, he
didn't see a hostage.  He told them that the apartment
building was empty.  In terms of a risk of flight, they
knew that they were on the second floor.  Hodge had said
to them that they needed a ladder to get in.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Hodge also said there was
probably a fire escape.  He was wrong about that, but he
did say that.
MR. FELDMAN:  He didn't say that to them at
the time, he said that in his deposition, and what he
said was he doesn't know whether there is or isn't a
fire escape.  So all these officers knew at the time is
that they were in a second floor building, with a second
floor and Hodge had said to them very specifically, you
need a ladder to get in.  That was the evidence.  That's
the best available objective evidence that was available
to these officers.  And under this Court's Fourth
Amendment jurisprudence, that's what we look at,
objective evidence.  Under the ADA, again, Section 139
uses that phrase, "best available objective evidence."
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and, Mr. Feldman, I
guess I'm still trying to figure out exactly who's
advocating for what legal standard and how those
standards are connected with each other.  But if -- if
you are using this direct threat regulation, do you
understand you and the City to be advocating for the
same legal standard?
MR. FELDMAN:  I think so.  I think what
differentiates the City on the one hand and us on the
other is not what testifies, but whether it's satisfied
here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because you're both looking
to the regulation as the test.
MR. FELDMAN:  Right.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And the City says it's
satisfied; you say it's not.
MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  And -- and the
interesting thing is they're supporting the amici cite
the same regulation.  Our supporting amici cite the same
regulation.  That is the regulation that governs whether
there is or isn't a defense to a failure to accommodate.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So the only party who is not
saying that that's the standard is the Solicitor
General, whose stand -- whose regulation it is.
MR. FELDMAN:  Well, the Solicitor -- that's
right.  That's right.
(Laughter.)
MR. FELDMAN:  But -- but the Solicitor
General does have a footnote in their brief that says
that even after the -- the special circumstances
analysis is conducted, the direct threat analysis might
also be applicable.  And I don't quite understand how
that is the case, but as I said, I don't think this is
the right case for this Court to -- to be thinking about
whether a special circumstances test make sense.  It
just hasn't had an opportunity to be vetted below.  But
what we're left with is pretty wide agreement that the
direct threat defense governs these issues.
And so if the Court doesn't have any more
questions about that, I'll briefly address qualified
immunity.
The issue on qualified immunity is -- is
also a narrow one.  It's not whether there is a Fourth
Amendment violation, but whether the actions here
violated clearly established law.  And in the Ninth
Circuit, we have two cases that involve substantially
similar facts, and they're both cited by the Ninth
Circuit in its decision below.  One was Alexander and
the other was Diorro.
Alexander is a particularly interesting case
because the defendant there was the City and County of
San Francisco.  So if they were aware of any case, you
would think that would be one of them.  The plaintiff in
Alexander was mentally ill.  The officers arrived at his
house to execute an administrative warrant, and rather
than allow them to do it, the plaintiff there threatened
to shoot anyone who entered his house.  And it's the
exact same circumstances we have here.  The situation
was contained, there was no need to immediately enter
and the officers made the decision to go in in
circumstances that led to a violent outcome.  And the
Ninth Circuit held that the officers there were not
entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law
because the extent of the threat was unknown and
disputed.  So it -- it raised a jury question.
Diorro is the other case that the Ninth
Circuit cited.  Diorro stands for the proposition that
where an officer knows that an individual's mentally
disabled, that's something that has to be considered in
determining what force is appropriate under the Fourth
Amendment.  And we have very clear testimony from the
officers here that at least when Reynolds made the
decision to force their way back into Sheehan's
apartment, they didn't consider Sheehan's disability.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought in Diorro, the
plaintiff was unarmed, had not attacked or touched
anyone, had generally obeyed instructions.
MR. FELDMAN:  Well, what the Court said is
that he was unarmed in the sense that he didn't have a
knife or a gun.  What he had, though, was lighters
fluid.  And so he had a dangerous instrumentality and --
and the issue is the same, the police officers forced a
violent confrontation when there wasn't a need to do so.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's very hard when
you have such a fact-intensive inquiry, and I think that
was part of your submission, to say that the law was
clearly established as to how they should function in a
particular circumstance, which I think is important when
you're talking about making the officers personally
liable.
MR. FELDMAN:  Yeah.  Although this Court has
looked at whether the facts of a previous case are
substantially similar or sometimes it's -- it's
described as being fundamentally similar.  The facts
don't have to be the same.  Substantial similarity
doesn't require exact similarity.  But the facts of
Alexander, in particular, are very, very close to the
facts in our case.  So whether it's fact specific or
not, we -- we've got --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Only facts in the same
jurisdiction -- of cases in the same jurisdiction are
relevant?
MR. FELDMAN:  I think that's a bigger
issue than what we --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  Well, I mean, suppose
this officer knows that in -- in some jurisdictions or
at least in the Fifth Circuit, boy, you know, if this
person's armed and violent, I don't have to accommodate
at all.  So, you know, you could say that the point
was -- was not clear.  I mean, how can you say that --
that it was clear under -- at least under Supreme Court
law?
MR. FELDMAN:  Well, the Supreme Court's
decision in Wilson v. Lane and Hope v. Pelzer, both look
at whether there's precedent in the controlling circuit.
These are officers who are in San Francisco within the
jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit, and unless and until
this Court takes a case and reverses something that the
Ninth Circuit has said, I think that they're duty bound
to comply with Ninth Circuit precedent.
JUSTICE ALITO:  On the qualified immunity
issue, could we consider the question whether there was
a Fourth Amendment violation at all?  Assuming the
City -- assuming that counsel for the officers raised
that argument?
MR. FELDMAN:  Well, yes, absolutely.  They
did not raise it in their Petitioner's brief or the
reply brief.  They focused instead on the second prong
of the qualified immunity analysis, but certainly, this
Court has the discretion to reach the Fourth Amendment
principles instead.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, do you think they
waived that argument?
MR. FELDMAN:  I think there's an argument
that they did, but again, it's -- it's an issue that I
think the Court has discretion to do what's appropriate.
But I think it would be unusual for the Court to
address -- and I think the Solicitor General makes this
point, too -- to address an issue that hasn't been
adequately briefed.
If I could just conclude.  I think the Court
knows that this is a case with enormous policy
implications.  One of our amici, and we've got several,
one of our amici counts among its members a family that
called the police to get help with their mentally
disabled son.  And the police showed up, and they, I'm
sure, intended to help that individual, but instead,
they hurt it.  And we see this in the news day after
day, week after week, where the police arrive to help
somebody and they wind up hurting them.
And, Your Honors, it's only when officers
and public entities are held accountable for actions
like those that occurred here that we can expect to see
a change in that pattern.  So we ask that this Court
affirm the Ninth Circuit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Van Aken, you have three minutes

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE VAN AKEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. VAN AKEN:  I'd like to make two points
in my very brief time.  The first is that I think
the Court took this case because there's a division in
the circuits about the weight that they give to exigency
and safety concerns in dangerous arrests like this one.
I don't think there could be any question that in the
Fifth Circuit, in the Fourth Circuit, where exigency has
a lot of weight in the reasonableness analysis, that
this case would have come out differently.  And I think
that's the fundamental legal difference between the
circuits and between the parties.
What I heard Mr. Feldman say -- this is my
second point, and it goes to the reasonableness of an
accommodation.  I heard him say that it would only be
reasonable to accommodate her if they could have
eliminated the risk, but the risk was eliminated when
the door was closed.  And with respect, I agree with the
Solicitor General.  He's incorrect that the risk was
eliminated, because -- Mr. Feldman is incorrect that the
risk is eliminated because Ms. Sheehan, whether or not
she was fully contained, whether or not they had been
told by Mr. Hodge that there was no other exit, she
certainly was not visible.  And behind her closed door,
she could have been gathering her other knives,
preparing an ambush, she had a cluttered room full of
household items, maybe there was a cup of bleach she
could throw in the face of the officers.  The point is
that the officers knew that they meant -- she meant them
harm, they knew that she did not intend to go peacefully
to the hospital, and they knew that at some point
someone was going to have to go back in that room and
deal with the situation.  And so delay behind a closed
door could have been allowing her time to calm down, but
the officers had no way to know that.
The final point I want to make is that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that the point of
the treatment, though, to try to give it a chance?  I
mean, what your adversary has said is, we can't assume,
unless we want a society in which the mentally ill are
automatically killed, there's 350 people a year,
estimated, who are shot by police officers and killed,
who have mental illness.  And this is not to minimize,
there's a hundred police officers who are killed, almost
half of them from ambushes, and the other 50, I'm not
sure what the circumstances were, but not ambush
circumstances.  The point is, isn't the ADA -- and the
House report makes this very clear -- intended to ensure
that police officers try mitigation in these situations
before they jump to violence.
MS. VAN AKEN:  Not where it increases safety
risks to the officers.  The nature of the activity at
the point where they were deciding whether to go in or
not was to resolve a safety risk.  So any accommodation
that increases a safety risk isn't reasonable as a
matter of law.  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
