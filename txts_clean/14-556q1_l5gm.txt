CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
this morning in Case No. 14-556, Obergefell v. Hodges
and the consolidated cases.
Ms. Bonauto.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY L. BONAUTO
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 1
MS. BONAUTO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The intimate and committed relationships of
same-sex couples, just like those of heterosexual
couples, provide mutual support and are the foundation
of family life in our society.  If a legal commitment,
responsibility and protection that is marriage is off
limits to gay people as a class, the stain of
unworthiness that follows on individuals and families
contravenes the basic constitutional commitment to equal
dignity.
Indeed, the abiding purpose of the
Fourteenth Amendment is to preclude relegating classes
of persons to second-tier status.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you do with the
Windsor case where the court stressed the Federal
government's historic deference to States when it comes
to matters of domestic relations?
MS. BONAUTO:  States do have primacy over
domestic relations except that their laws must respect
the constitutional rights of persons, and Windsor
couldn't have been clearer about that.  And here we have
a whole class of people who are denied the equal right
to be able to join in this very extensive government
institution that provides protection for families.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you say join
in the institution.  The argument on the other side is
that they're seeking to redefine the institution.  Every
definition that I looked up, prior to about a dozen
years ago, defined marriage as unity between a man and a
woman as husband and wife.  Obviously, if you succeed,
that core definition will no longer be operable.
MS. BONAUTO:  I hope not, Your Honor,
because of what we're really talking about here is a
class of people who are, by State laws, excluded from
being able to participate in this institution.  And if
Your Honor's question is about does this really draw a
sexual orientation line --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  My question is
you're not seeking to join the institution, you're
seeking to change what the institution is.  The
fundamental core of the institution is the opposite-sex
relationship and you want to introduce into it a
same-sex relationship.
MS. BONAUTO:  Two points on that, Your
Honor.  To the extent that if you're talking about the
fundamental right to marry as a core male-female
institution, I think when we look at the Fourteenth
Amendment, we know that it provides enduring guarantees
in that what we once viewed as the role of women, or
even the role of gay people, is something that has
changed in our society.  So in a sense, just as the
Lawrence court called out the Bowers court for not
appreciating the extent of the liberty at stake, in the
same vein here, the question is whether gay people share
that same liberty to be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The problem --
MS. BONAUTO:  -- able to form family
relationships.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  One -- one of the problems
is when you think about these cases you think about
words or cases, and -- and the word that keeps coming
back to me in this case is -- is millennia, plus time.
First of all, there has not been really time, so the
Respondents say, for the Federal system to engage in
this debate, the separate States.  But on a larger
scale, it's been -- it was about -- about the same time
between Brown and Loving as between Lawrence and this
case.  It's about 10 years.
And so there's time for the scholars and the
commentators and -- and the bar and the public to -- to
engage in it.  But still, 10 years is -- I don't even
know how to count the decimals when we talk about
millennia.  This definition has been with us for
millennia.  And it -- it's very difficult for the Court
to say, oh, well, we -- we know better.
MS. BONAUTO:  Well, I don't think this is a
question of the Court knowing better.  When we think
about the debate, the place of gay people in our civic
society is something that has been contested for more
than a century.  And in this -- in the last century,
immigration exclusions, the place of gay people in
public employment and Federal service, these are all
things that have been contested and -- and you can --
you can say 10 years of marriage for Massachusetts, but
it's also in the 1970s that the Baker case from
Minnesota reached this Court, and that's over 40 years
ago.
And it was over 20 years ago that the Hawaii
Supreme Court seemed to indicate that it would rule in
favor of marriage, and the American people have been
debating and discussing this.  It has been exhaustively
aired, and the bottom line is that gay and lesbian
families live in communities as neighbors throughout
this whole country.  And people have seen this --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You argue in your -- you
argue in your brief that the primary purpose of the
Michigan law limiting marriage to a man and a woman was
to demean gay people; is that correct?
MS. BONAUTO:  The Michigan -- the Michigan
statute and amendment certainly went out of their way to
say that gay people were in some sense antithetical to
the good of society.  They wrote that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And did -- did you say in
your brief that the primary purpose of that was to
demean gay people?
MS. BONAUTO:  I think it has that effect,
Your Honor.  I do.  Now, at the same time --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that true just in
Michigan or is that true of -- of every other State that
has a similar definition of marriage?
MS. BONAUTO:  Well, if we're talking about
the States that have constitutional amendments, many of
them are similar.  There are a few States that have just
statutes and didn't have amendments, and there's some,
of course, that had none of the above.
But even if there's not a purpose to demean,
I think the common commonality among all of the
statutes, whether they were enacted long ago or more
recently, is that they encompass moral judgments and
stereotypes about gay people.  Even if you think about
something 100 years ago, gay people were not worthy of
the concern of the government and the -- and -- and
moral judgments about --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how do you account for
the fact that, as far as I'm aware, until the end of the
20th century, there never was a nation or a culture that
recognized marriage between two people of the same sex?
Now, can we infer from that that those nations and those
cultures all thought that there was some rational,
practical purpose for defining marriage in that way or
is it your argument that they were all operating
independently based solely on irrational stereotypes and
prejudice?
MS. BONAUTO:  Your Honor, my position is
that times can blind.  And if you think about the
example of sex discrimination and what it -- again, I
assume it was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, but
it took over 100 years for this Court to recognize that
a sex classification contravened the Constitution.
But then, in short order, between Reed and
Craig v. Boren, we went from a rational-basis approach
to -- to heightened scrutiny, acknowledging that this
kind of discrimination is invidious.  And in the same
vein here, we have a foundation of Romer, of Lawrence,
of Windsor --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And an institution --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't really think you
answered my question.
MS. BONAUTO:  I'm sorry.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Can we infer that these
societies all thought there was a rational reason for
this and a practical reason for this?
MS. BONAUTO:  I don't know what other
societies assumed, but I do believe that times can blind
and it takes time to see stereotypes and to see the
common humanity of people who had once been ignored or
excluded.  And I do believe --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you wouldn't be
asking for this relief if the law of marriage was what
it was a millennium ago.  I mean, it wasn't possible.
Same-sex unions would not have opted into the pattern of
marriage, which was a relationship, a dominant and a
subordinate relationship.  Yes, it was marriage between
a man and a woman, but the man decided where the couple
would be domiciled; it was her obligation to follow him.
There was a change in the institution of
marriage to make it egalitarian when it wasn't
egalitarian.  And same-sex unions wouldn't -- wouldn't
fit into what marriage was once.
MS. BONAUTO:  That's correct.  I mean, for
centuries we had -- we had and -- and Europe had this
coverture system where a woman's legal identity was
absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had
different prescribed legal roles.  And again, because of
equality and changing social circumstances, all of those
gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of
the married pair have been eliminated.  And that, of
course, is a system in which committed, same-sex couples
fit quite well.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Coverture was not --
coverture was not a universal aspect of marriage
around -- around the world.  And there again, if you
look at the basic definition, it is between a man and a
woman.  It does not always say between a man and a woman
in which the woman is subordinate in legal respects.  So
I'm not sure it's still again a fair analogy to your
situation.
MS. BONAUTO:  Well, Your -- Your Honor, the
thing about marriage is that it's controlled and
regulated by the States.  The States create the
definition of civil marriage and certainly are
accountable for those definitions and any exclusions
which follow.  And, of course, we all know there were
exclusions in cases like Loving and Zablocki and Turner
where in each case with prisoners, the people behind on
their child support payments, with a mixed-race couple
who wanted to be able to join this institution, and even
though some of those exclusions were quite traditional,
they could not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it was -- not all
societies banned mixed-race marriages.  In fact, not
even all States in this country banned.  But I don't
know of any -- do you know of any society, prior to the
Netherlands in 2001, that permitted same-sex marriage?
MS. BONAUTO:  As a legal matter, Your Honor?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  As a legal matter.
MS. BONAUTO:  I -- I am not.  I am not.
At -- it would not.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  For millennia, not -- not a
single other society until the Netherlands in 2001, and
you're telling me they were all -- I don't know what.
MS. BONAUTO:  No.  What I'm saying is
setting -- taking that tradition as it is, one still
needs -- the Court still needs a reason to maintain that
tradition when it has the effect --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, may I ask a --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the -- the issue, of
course, is -- is -- is not whether there should be
same-sex marriage, but who should decide the point.
MS. BONAUTO:  Yes, and we --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you're -- you're asking
us to -- to decide it for this society when no other
society until 2001 ever had it.  And how many States
have -- have voted to have same-sex marriage or their
legislature or -- or by referendum?  I think it's 11,
isn't it?
MS. BONAUTO:  Yes.  But I would also count
the State courts that interpret their Constitutions.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, yes, that -- the
State courts who agree with you.  But once again,
that's not the people deciding it.  It's -- it's judges
deciding it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, counselor, in -- in
terms of this millennium, what's been the status or the
view of gay people in most of those countries?  Have
they been subject to the kinds of discrimination that
they were subject to here?  Were they welcomed into the
worldwide community?  Was it free of discrimination?
MS. BONAUTO:  Well, if you're speaking of
the world, not every legal system around the world has
the kind of system with its explicit constitutional
guarantees for all persons of liberty and equality, and
that immediately sets the United States off from so many
other countries.  And of course there are now, I don't
know if it's 17 or 18 countries that actually do
authorize marriage for same-sex couples in Europe, in
South America, New Zealand.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But there have been cultures
that did not frown on homosexuality.  That is not a
universal opinion throughout history and across all
cultures.  Ancient Greece is an example.  It was -- it
was well accepted within certain bounds.  But did they
have same-sex marriage in ancient Greece?
MS. BONAUTO:  Yeah.  They don't -- I don't
believe they had anything comparable to what we have,
Your Honor.  You know, and we're talking about --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, they had marriage,
didn't they?
MS. BONAUTO:  Yeah, they had -- yes.  They
had some sort of marriage.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And they had -- and they had
same-sex relations, did they not?
MS. BONAUTO:  Yes.  And they also were able
to --
JUSTICE ALITO:  People like Plato wrote in
favor of that, did he not?
MS. BONAUTO:  In favor of?
JUSTICE ALITO:  Same-sex -- wrote
approvingly of same-sex relationships, did he not?
MS. BONAUTO:  I believe so, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So their limiting marriage
to couples of the opposite sex was not based on
prejudice against gay people, was it?
MS. BONAUTO:  I can't speak to what was
happening with the ancient philosophers.  What I feel
like --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it's -- you -- you
said that, well, marriage is different because it's
controlled by the government.  But from a historical --
from anthropological standpoint, Justice Scalia was very
careful to talk about societies.  Justice Alito talked
about cultures.  If you read the -- about the Kalahari
people or -- or ancient peoples, they didn't have a
government like this.  They made it themselves and it
was man and a woman.
MS. BONAUTO:  There were certainly prior
to -- there were marriages prior to the United States
forming and we recognize that.  But when our nation did
form into this union in 1787 and then when it affirmed
the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, that's when we made --
our nation collectively made a commitment to individual
liberty and equality.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what -- maybe you're
doing that, but I would like to hear the precise answer
to the question you've been asked several times.
MS. BONAUTO:  Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And to me, it takes the
form, the opposite view has been the law everywhere for
thousands of years among people who were not
discriminating even against gay people, and suddenly you
want nine people outside the ballot box to require
States that don't want to do it to change what you've
heard is change what marriage is to include gay people.
Why cannot those States at least wait and see whether in
fact doing so in the other States is or is not harmful
to marriage?
Now, that same question has been put in
many, many ways in the briefs on our subject.  You've
received it in three or four different ways.  I would
like to know, so I can hear and understand it, just what
your response is.
MS. BONAUTO:  Okay.  And I apologize if I
haven't.
In our system, you know, with the Fourteenth
Amendment, which again is -- sets forth principles that
we all are governed by and govern our lives, and you
look at examples like coverture.  Okay?  Even if it was
not universal, it was still something that was wide --
widespread in this nation for a very, very long time,
and that change in marriage was deeply unsettling to
people.
Likewise, even if race was not used as a
basis for discriminating in every single State as a
matter of law by criminal law and constitutional law, it
was incredibly pervasive.  And again, changing that, as
Virginia resisted in the Loving case, resisted and said
please, wait and see, 80 percent of the American public
was with Virginia on that.  But again, it was the
question of the individual liberty of the person to do
something that was considered a profound change in its
time.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose we rule in your
favor in this case and then after that, a group
consisting of two men and two women apply for a marriage
license.  Would there be any ground for denying them a
license?
MS. BONAUTO:  I believe so, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What would be the reason?
MS. BONAUTO:  There'd be two.  One is
whether the State would even say that that is such a
thing as a marriage, but then beyond that, there are
definitely going to be concerns about coercion and
consent and disrupting family relationships when you
start talking about multiple persons.
But I want to also just go back to the wait
and see question for a moment, if I may.  Because --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I didn't understand
your answer.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  I hope you will come
back to mine.  If you want to go back to the earlier
one --
MS. BONAUTO:  No, no.
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- then you can come back to
mine.
MS. BONAUTO:  Well, that's what -- I mean,
that is -- I mean, the State --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if there's no --
these are 4 people, 2 men and 2 women, it's not -- it's
not the sort of polygamous relationship, polygamous
marriages that existed in other societies and still
exist in some societies today.  And let's say they're
all consenting adults, highly educated.  They're all
lawyers.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO:  What would be the ground
under -- under the logic of the decision you would like
us to hand down in this case?  What would be the logic
of denying them the same right?
MS. BONAUTO:  Number one, I assume the
States would rush in and say that when you're talking
about multiple people joining into a relationship, that
that is not the same thing that we've had in marriage,
which is on the mutual support and consent of two
people.  Setting that aside, even assuming it is within
the fundamental right --
JUSTICE ALITO:  But -- well, I don't know
what kind of a distinction that is because a marriage
between two people of the same sex is not something that
we have had before, recognizing that is a substantial
break.  Maybe it's a good one.  So this is no -- why is
that a greater break?
MS. BONAUTO:  The question is one of --
again, assuming it's within the fundamental right, the
question then becomes one of justification.  And I
assume that the States would come in and they would say
that there are concerns about consent and coercion.  If
there's a divorce from the second wife, does that mean
the fourth wife has access to the child of the second
wife?  There are issues around who is it that makes the
medical decisions, you know, in the time of crisis.
I assume there'd be lots of family
disruption issues, setting aside issues of coercion and
consent and so on that just don't apply here, when we're
talking about two consenting adults who want to make
that mutual commitment for as long as they shall be.  So
that's my answer on that.
And just if I may turn for a moment to the
wait and see for a moment.  Wait and see by itself has
never been considered a legitimate justification, a
freestanding justification under the Fourteenth
Amendment.  And what we're talking about here with
waiting and seeing is we're talking about -- we're
talking about the Petitioners being denied marriage.
And we're talking about a second class status being
tried as a matter of the Constitution --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, part of wait and
see, I suppose, is to ascertain whether the social
science, the new studies are accurate.  But that -- it
seems to me, then, that we should not consult at all the
social science on this, because it's too new.  You think
-- you say we don't need to wait for changes.  So it
seems to me that if we're not going to wait, then it's
only fair for us to say, well, we're not going to
consult social science.
MS. BONAUTO:  Well, two points on that, if I
may.  In terms of waiting, I do think the effect of
waiting is not neutral, it does consign same-sex couples
to this outlier status, and there will be profound
consequences that follow from that.
But then setting that aside vis-à-vis the
social science, there have been trials, of course in the
Michigan case, in Arkansas, in Florida about adoption
bans.  These issues have been aired repeatedly, and
there is, as you all have heard, a social science
consensus that there's nothing about the sex or sexual
orientation of the parent that is going to affect child
outcomes.  And this isn't just research about gay
people.  It's research about, you know, again, what is
the effect of gender, it goes for 50 years.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're -- you're
quite right that the consequences of waiting are not
neutral.  On the other hand, one of the things that's
truly extraordinary about this whole issue is how
quickly has been the acceptance of your position across
broad elements of society.  I don't know what the latest
opinion polls show.
The situation in Maine, I think, is -- is
characteristic.  In 2009, I guess it was by referendum
or whatever, they banned gay marriage.  In 2012, they
enacted it as law.  I mean, that sort of quick change
has been a characteristic of this debate, but if you
prevail here, there will be no more debate.  I mean,
closing the debate can close minds, and -- and it will
have a consequence on how this new institution is -- is
accepted.  People feel very differently about something
if they have a chance to vote on it than if it's imposed
on them by -- by the courts.
MS. BONAUTO:  Well, there's a few points
there, and I hope I get them all.  With respect to
Maine, one thing that separates Maine from the States
that we're talking about here is that there wasn't a
constitutional amendment in place that really largely
shuts down the process.  It is extraordinarily difficult
to amend the Constitution, and an opinion poll is not a
measure in any way of what a legislature is going to do
in terms of approving an amendment to go out to the
voters.  So there -- there are some serious structural
problems that did not apply in a place like Maine.
And in terms of acceptance, when I think
about acceptance, I think about the nation as a whole,
and the -- and there are places where, again, there are
no protections, virtually no protections for gay and
lesbian people in employment, in parenting.  You know,
the Michigan Petitioners, for example, are not allowed
to be parents of their own children, the children that
the State of Michigan has placed with them and approved
of their adoptions.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Miss -- Miss Bonauto,
I'm -- I'm concerned about the wisdom of this Court
imposing through the Constitution a -- a requirement of
action which is unpalatable to many of our citizens for
religious reasons.  They are not likely to change their
view about what marriage consists of.  And were -- were
the States to adopt it by law, they could make
exceptions to what -- what is required for same-sex
marriage, who has to honor it and so forth.
But once it's -- it's made a matter of
constitutional law, those exceptions -- for example, is
it -- is it conceivable that a minister who is
authorized by the State to conduct marriage can decline
to marry two men if indeed this Court holds that they
have a constitutional right to marry?  Is it conceivable
that that would be allowed?
MS. BONAUTO:  Your Honor, of course the
Constitution will continue to apply, and right to this
day, no clergy is forced to marry any couple that they
don't want to marry.  We have those protections.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but right to this
day, we have never held that there is a constitutional
right for these two people to marry, and the minister is
-- to the extent he's conducting a civil marriage, he's
an instrument of the State.  I don't see how you could
possibly allow that minister to say, I will only marry a
man and a woman.  I will not marry two men.  Which means
you -- you would -- you could -- you could have
ministers who -- who conduct real marriages that -- that
are civilly enforceable at the National Cathedral, but
not at St. Matthews downtown, because that minister
refuses to marry two men, and therefore, cannot be given
the State power to make a real State marriage.  I don't
see any -- any answer to that.  I really don't.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor, there have
been antidiscrimination laws in various States; correct?
MS. BONAUTO:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Antidiscrimination laws
regarding gay people.
MS. BONAUTO:  Correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And in any of those
States, have ministers been forced to do gay marriages?
MS. BONAUTO:  Of course not, Your Honor.
And --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They are laws.  They are
not constitutional requirements.  That was the whole
point of my question.  If you let the States do it, you
can make an exception.  The State can say, yes, two men
can marry, but -- but ministers who do not believe in --
in same-sex marriage will still be authorized to conduct
marriages on behalf of the State.  You can't do that
once it is a constitutional proscription.
MS. BONAUTO:  If one thing is firm, and I
believe it is firm, that under the First Amendment, that
a clergyperson cannot be forced to officiate at a
marriage that he or she does not want to officiate at.
And since there were several other questions, if I may.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He's not being required to
officiate.  He's just not given the State's power,
unless he agrees to use that power in -- in accordance
with the Constitution.  I don't -- seems to me you
have to -- you have to make that exception.  You can't
appoint people who will then go ahead and violate the
Constitution.
MS. BONAUTO:  I think if we're talking about
a government individual, a clerk, a judge, who's
empowered to authorize marriage, that is a different
matter that they are going to have to follow through,
unless, again, a State decides to make some exceptions.
In Connecticut, after the court permitted marriage, it
did actually pass a law to do deal with implementation
issues, including these kinds of liberty issues.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because it was a State law.
That's my whole my point.  If it's a State law, you can
make those exceptions.  But if it's a constitutional
requirement, I don't see how you can.  And every State
allows ministers to marry people, and their marriages
are effective under State law.  That will not be the
case if, indeed, we hold, as a constitutional matter,
that the State must marry two men.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Bonauto, maybe I'm just
not understanding Justice Scalia's question, but for
example, there are many rabbis that will not conduct
marriages between Jews and non-Jews, notwithstanding
that we have a constitutional prohibition against
religious discrimination.  And those rabbis get all the
powers and privileges of the State, even if they have
that rule, most -- many, many, many rabbis won't do
that.
MS. BONAUTO:  That's precisely --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's called Congress shall
make no law respecting the freedom of religion --
MS. BONAUTO:  So, yes --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- but that --
MS. BONAUTO:  -- can I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- it leaves this
question --
MS. BONAUTO:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- open?
MS. BONAUTO:  Yes.  And I will just say very
briefly --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you -- you --
MS. BONAUTO:  And I need to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- you agree with that --
MS. BONAUTO:  -- reserve my time, if I may.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- then?  You agree that --
that ministers will not have to conduct same-sex
marriages?
MS. BONAUTO:  If they do not want to, that
is correct.  I believe that is affirmed under the First
Amendment.
And I will say before I sit down, if I may
reserve my time, Your Honor, that in terms of the
question of who decides, it's not about the Court versus
the States.  It's about the individual making the choice
to marry and with whom to marry, or the government.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
(Interruption.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General, would you
like to take a moment?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I will.  Thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice.
Actually, Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court is
ready.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we're ready.
Okay.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It was rather refreshing,
actually.
(Laughter.)
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 1
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
The opportunity to marry is integral to
human dignity.  Excluding gay and lesbian couples from
marriage demeans the dignity of these couples.  It did
demeans their children, and it denies the -- both the
couples and their children the stabilizing structure
that marriage affords.
Now, the Respondents' principal argument,
and what we've been discussing this morning so far, is
whether this issue of -- whether this discrimination
should persist is something that should be left to the
political process or whether it should be something
decided by the Court.  And I'd like to make three points
about that, if I could.
First, the -- I think it's important to
understand that if this Court concludes that this issue
should be left to the political process, what the Court
will be saying is that the demeaning, second-class
status that gay and lesbian couples now inhabit in -- in
States that do not provide for marriage is consistent
with the equal protection of the laws.  That is not a
wait-and-see.  That is a validation.
And second, to the extent that the thought
is that this can be left to the political process
because this issue will take care of itself over time,
because attitudes are changing, what I respectfully
submit to the Court is that although no one can see the
future perfectly, of course, that it seems much more
likely to me that the outcome that we're going to end up
with is something that will approximate the nation as a
house divided that we had with de jure racial
segregation.  You may have many States, perhaps most
States, in which gay couples can live with equal dignity
and status, but you will have a minority of States in
which gay couples will be relegated to demeaning,
second-class status, and I don't know why we would want
to repeat that history.
And third --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But, General, I --
I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And third, I want to
expand on what Ms. Bonauto said, that -- that -- and I
think you, Mr. Chief Justice, you did recognize this,
that the decision to leave this to the political process
is going to impose enormous costs that this Court
thought were costs of constitutional stature in Windsor.
Thousands and thousands of people are going to live out
their lives and go to their deaths without their States
ever recognizing the equal dignity of their
relationships.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you could have said
the same thing 10 years ago or so when we had Lawrence.
Haven't we learned a tremendous amount since -- well,
since Lawrence, just in the last 10 years?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  And, Your Honor, I
actually think that's quite a critical point that goes
to the questions that Your Honor was asking earlier.  I
do think Lawrence was an important catalyst that has
brought us to where we are today.  And I think what
Lawrence did was provide an assurance that gay and
lesbian couples could live openly in society as free
people and start families and raise families and
participate fully in their communities without fear.
And there are -- two things flow from that,
I think.  One is that has brought us to the point where
we understand now, in a way even that we did not fully
understand in Lawrence, that gay and lesbian people and
gay and lesbian couples are full and equal members of
the community.  And what we once thought of as necessary
and proper reasons for ostracizing and marginalizing gay
people, we now understand do not justify that kind of
impression.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The difference, of
course, is Lawrence, the whole argument is the State
cannot intrude on that personal relationship.  This, it
seems to me, is -- is different in that what the
argument is is the State must sanction.  It must approve
that relationship.  They're two different questions.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It is different, I agree.
And I -- and it leads to the second thing I think that
the -- that the Lawrence catalyzed for our society, was
it put gay and lesbian couples, gay and lesbian people,
in a position for the first time in our history to be
able to lay claim to the abiding promise of the
Fourteenth Amendment in a way that was just impossible
when they were marginalized and ostracized.
And you're right, Mr. Chief Justice, this is
about equal participation, participation on equal terms
in a State-conferred -- a State-conferred status, a
State institution.  That is different than Lawrence, but
I do think that what Lawrence has allowed us to see is
that the justifications for excluding gay and lesbian
couples from equal participation in this institution
just hold up.
And I do think -- and the Court has raised
this question about whether what we are talking about
here is a -- is a fundamental change in the nature of
marriage.  And I think the answer to that question is
that this case can be decided by thinking about marriage
in exactly the way the States -- the Respondent States
and other States have defined marriage now.
And I think it's important to think about it
this way.  Heterosexual couples can enter marriage, and
they can have families through biological procreation.
They can have families through assisted reproduction.
They can have families through adoption, or they can not
have families at all.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you think --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And I --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- are the essential
elements of marriage as it exists today?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think the
essential elements of marriage are the ones that are --
that -- the -- the obligations of mutual support and
responsibility and the benefits surrounding marriage
that State law provides to ensure that there is an
enduring bond, that enduring bond that continues over
time and lasts, hopefully, till death do us part,
through the end of life.  And that -- and with -- and --
and, certainly, childrearing is bound up in that.
But what I would suggest, Justice Alito, is
the way in which childbearing -- bearing is bound up in
that is quite different than what my friends on the
other side are suggesting.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's -- let's think
about two groups of two people.  The first is the
same-sex couple who have been together for 25 years, and
they get married either as a result of a change in State
law or as a result of a Court decision.  The second two
people are unmarried siblings.  They've lived together
for 25 years.  Their financial relationship is the same
as the -- the same-sex couple.  They share household
expenses and household chores in the same way.  They
care for each other in the same way.
Is there any reason why the law should treat
the two groups differently?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I'm not sure that the
law would -- the -- the law allows 100 percent of
heterosexual people to enter into a marriage that's
consistent with their sexual orientation, and in these
States, it forbids 100 percent of gay and lesbian people
from entering into a marriage that's consistent with
their sexual orientation --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, as far as --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- and justifies that
difference.
JUSTICE ALITO:  As far as the -- the
benefits that Federal law confers on married people,
such as in Windsor, the effect on estate taxes, what
would be the reason for treating those two groups
differently?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I -- I -- I'm not
entirely sure there would be, but, of course, marriage
is something more fundamental than that.  It is an
enduring bond between two people.
And to get back to the point about
childrearing, I do think this is quite important.  I
mean, I -- I understand, and in part of their
wait-and-see and caution argument, that Respondents
are -- that what Respondents are saying here is that
they -- that they want to exercise an attitude of
caution because of concern about the welfare of children
raised in same-sex married households.
But there's a quite significant problem with
that rationale, and it's this:  Right now, today,
hundreds of thousands of children are being raised in
same-sex households.  That number is only going to grow.
All of the evidence so far shows you that there isn't a
problem, and what the -- and the States' argument really
is quite ironic in this respect that it's going to deny
marriage, the State --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that's quite a
statement.  All of the evidence shows there is no
problem.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All of the evidence shows
there's not a problem.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I -- I think all of the
leading organizations that have filed briefs have said
to you that there is a consensus in that, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I think some of
the -- some of the briefs contradicted that.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But -- but even beyond
that, I think the more fundamental point, and the point
I'm trying to drive at here, is that you have hundreds
of thousands of children raised in same-sex households
now.  And what Respondents' position and Respondents'
caution argument leads you to is the conclusion that
those hundreds of thousands of children don't get the
stabilizing structure and the many benefits of marriage.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I'd like to
follow up in a line of questioning that Justice Scalia
started.
We have a concession from your friend that
clergy will not be required to perform same-sex
marriage, but there are going to be harder questions.
Would a religious school that has married housing be
required to afford such housing to same-sex couples?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I guess what I'd -- I'd
like to make three points about that, if I could,
Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the first
part --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And I will -- and I'll go
right at the question you asked.
The first one is, of course, this Court's
ruling addresses what the States must do under the
Fourteenth Amendment.
And the -- and the second point is that when
you get to a question like the one Your Honor asked,
that is going to depend on how States work out the
balance between their civil rights laws, whether they
decide that there's going to be civil rights enforcement
of discrimination based on sexual orientation or not,
and how they decide what kinds of accommodations they
are going to allow under State law.
And they could well -- you know, different
states could strike different balances.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about
Federal -- it's a Federal question if we make it a
matter of constitutional law.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But the question of
what -- how States use their enforcement power is up to
the States.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you have
enforcement power, too.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right.  And --
and -- well, that's certainly true, but there is no
Federal law now generally banning discrimination based
on sexual orientation, and that's where those issues are
going to have to be worked out.
And I guess the third point I would make,
Your Honor, is that these issues are going to arise no
matter which way you decide this case, because these
questions of accommodation are going to arise in
situations in States where there is no same-sex
marriage, where there are -- and, in fact, they have
arisen many times.  There -- there are these commitment
ceremonies.
For example, in the New Mexico case in which
this Court denied cert just a few months back, that did
not arise out of a marriage.  That arose out of a
commitment ceremony, and the -- and these, you know,
commitment ceremonies are going to need florists and
caterers.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in the Bob Jones case,
the Court held that a college was not entitled to
tax-exempt status if it opposed interracial marriage or
interracial dating.  So would the same apply to a
university or a college if it opposed same-sex marriage?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  You know, I -- I don't
think I can answer that question without knowing more
specifics, but it's certainly going to be an issue.
I -- I don't deny that.  I don't deny that, Justice
Alito.  It is -- it is going to be an issue.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me ask you --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I have one question.  I
see your time is going out.  I'm interested in your
comments on Glucksberg, which says what we should have
to define a fundamental right in its narrowest terms.
A lot of the questions that we're -- we're
asking your colleague in the earlier part of the
argument were -- had -- had that in mind, I think.
What -- what do we do with the language of Glucksberg
that says we have to define it in a narrow way?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Justice Kennedy, forgive
me for answering the question this way.
We do recognize that there's a profound
connection between liberty and equality, but the United
States has advanced only an equal protection argument.
We haven't made the fundamental rights argument under
Glucksberg.  And therefore, I'm not sure it would be
appropriate for me not having briefed it to comment on
that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, can you tell me why
you didn't make the fundamental argument?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, because we think --
well, because we think while we do see that there is, of
course, this profound connection, we do think that for
reasons like the ones implicit in the Chief Justice's
question, that this issue really sounds in equal
protection, as we understand it, because the question is
equal participation in a State conferred status and
institution.  And that's why we think of it in equal
protection terms.
And if I could just in the -- in the little
time that I have left, I'd like to suggest this, that
what the Respondents are ultimately saying to the Court
is that with respect to marriage, they are not ready
yet.  And yes, gay and lesbian couples can live openly
in society, and yes, they can raise children.  Yes, they
can participate fully as members of their community.
Marriage, though, not yet.  Leave that to be worked out
later.  But the Petitioners -- the Petitioners, these
gay and lesbian couples are --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or not.  Or not.  I mean,
that's not what they are saying.  They are saying leave
it to the people.  It will be worked out later or not.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But what these gay and
lesbian couples are doing is laying claim to the promise
of the Fourteenth Amendment now.  And it is emphatically
the duty of this Court, in this case, as it was in
Lawrence, to decide what the Fourteenth Amendment
requires.
And what I would suggest is that in a world
in which gay and lesbian couples live openly as our
neighbors, they raise their children side by side with
the rest of us, they contribute fully as members of the
community, that it is simply untenable -- untenable to
suggest that they can be denied the right of equal
participation in an institution of marriage, or that
they can be required to wait until the majority decides
that it is ready to treat gay and lesbian people as
equals.  Gay and lesbian people are equal.  They deserve
the equal protection of the laws, and they deserve it
now.  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.
Mr. Bursch.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. JOHN J. BURSCH
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS ON QUESTION 1
MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Respondents are not saying we're not ready
yet.  Respondents are really echoing the questions
that -- that Justice Breyer was asking.
This case isn't about how to define
marriage.  It's about who gets to decide that question.
Is it the people acting through the democratic process,
or is it the Federal courts?  And we're asking you to
affirm every individual's fundamental liberty interest
in deciding the meaning of marriage.  And I think this
whole case really turns on the questions that Justice
Scalia asked.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Nobody is
taking that away from anybody.  Every single individual
in this society chooses, if they can, their sexual
orientation or who to marry or not marry.  I suspect
even with us giving gays rights to marry that there's
some gay people who will choose not to.  Just as there's
some heterosexual couples who choose not to marry.  So
we're not taking anybody's liberty away.
MR. BURSCH:  But we're talking about the
fundamental liberty interest in deciding the question of
what marriage means, and to get that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know that
that's -- I mean, leaving that to the side, I thought
that I heard the answer to the question being given in
respect to tradition of 2000 years, and to the
democratic ballot box and so forth was quite simple.
What I heard was, one, marriage is fundamental.  I mean,
certainly that's true for 10,000 years.  And marriage,
as the States administer it, is open to vast numbers of
people who both have children, adopt children, don't
have children, all over the place.
But there is one group of people whom they
won't open marriage to.  So they have no possibility to
participate in that fundamental liberty.  That is people
of the same sex who wish to marry.  And so we ask, why?
And the answer we get is, well, people have always done
it.  You know, you could have answered that one the same
way we talk about racial segregation.
Or two, because certain religious groups do
think it's a sin, and I believe they sincerely think it.
There's no question about their sincerity, but is a
purely religious reason on the part of some people
sufficient?
And then when I look for reasons three, four
and five, I don't find them.  What are they?  So -- so
therefore, I'm asking -- there I put a long question,
but it gives you an opening to say what all of those
reasons are.
MR. BURSCH:  Justice Breyer, those answers
one and two are not our answers.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Good.
MR. BURSCH:  Our answer number one is that
the marriage institution did not develop to deny dignity
or to give second class status to anyone.  It developed
to serve purposes that, by their nature, arise from
biology.
Now, imagine a world today where we had no
marriage at all.  Men and women would still be getting
together and creating children, but they wouldn't be
attached to each other in any social institution.
Now, the -- the marriage view on the other
side here is that marriage is all about love and
commitment.  And as a society, we can agree that that's
important, but the State doesn't have any interest in
that.  If we're trying to solve that social problem I
just described, where there's no marriage, we wouldn't
solve it by saying, well, let's have people identify who
they are emotionally committed to and recognize those
relationships.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Bursch, I -- I
understand that argument.  It's the principal argument
that you make in -- in your briefs, that same-sex
marriage doesn't advance this State interest in
regulating procreation.
Let's just assume for the moment that that's
so.  Obviously, same-sex partners cannot procreate
themselves.  But is there -- in addition to that, are
you saying that recognizing same-sex marriage will
impinge upon that State interest, will harm that State
interest in regulating procreation through marriage?
MR. BURSCH:  We are saying that, Your Honor.
Now, obviously, under a rational basis,
that's not a question that you need to decide, but --
but even leaving that aside --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How could that -- how
could that be, because all of the incentives, all of the
benefits that marriage affords would still be available.
So you're not taking away anything from heterosexual
couples.  They would have the very same incentive to
marry, all the benefits that come with marriage that
they do now.
MR. BURSCH:  Justice Kagan and Justice
Ginsburg, it has to do with the societal understanding
of what marriage means.  This is a much bigger idea than
any particular couple and what a marriage might mean to
them or to their children.  And when you change the
definition of marriage to delink the idea that we're
binding children with their biological mom and dad, that
has consequences.  So, you know, for example, a
reasonable --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You don't do that.
MR. BURSCH:  If I could --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the problem.
MR. BURSCH:  If -- if I could --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Marriage doesn't do that
on any level.  How many married couples do fathers with
the benefits or the requirements of marriage walk away
from their children?
MR. BURSCH:  Justice --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it's not that the
institution alone does it and that without it that
father is going to stay in the marriage.  He made a
choice.
MR. BURSCH:  Justice --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I would say that it
could -- I could -- it should be gender-neutral.  Some
mothers do the same thing.
But my point is that I'm not sure how I get
to the point that Justice Breyer is making:  How does
withholding marriage from one group, same -- same-sex
couples, increase the value to the other group?
MR. BURSCH:  Justice Sotomayor, there's all
kinds of societal pressures that are already delinking
that reason that the State advances for marriage,
keeping kids and their biological moms and dads together
whenever possible.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Do -- do you
have to answer that question?
MR. BURSCH:  Under rational basis, we don't.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is -- is it your burden to
show that it -- it -- it will harm marriage between a
man and woman if -- if you allow two men or two women to
marry?  Is that your burden?  I thought your burden was
simply to show that -- that the State's reason for this
institution is a reason that has nothing to do, that is
inapplicable to same-sex couples.
MR. BURSCH:  Justice Scalia, you're exactly
right, and that's why we -- we prevail.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but I don't think --
MR. BURSCH:  But -- but I want to answer
your question.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that's right, Mr. Bursch.
I don't think that that's right.  I think before
something as fundamental to a society and to individuals
as marriage, before an exclusion of this kind can be
made in that institution, the State needs some reason
for that exclusion.
MR. BURSCH:  And that's why I'd like to
answer.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And I've given you an -- a
real opportunity to tell me what that reason is.
MR. BURSCH:  Yes, I -- I --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What is the reason for the
exclusion rather than the reason for the noninclusion?
MR. BURSCH:  Well, first, it wasn't a reason
for an exclusion.  It was a definition to solve a
particular problem.  But the reason why there's --
there's harm if you change the definition because, in
people's minds, if marriage and creating children don't
have anything to do with each other, then what do you
expect?  You expect more children outside of marriage.
Now, I want to give you a -- a hypothetical.
Imagine two couples --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But do you think -- do you
think that that's what it would do, Mr. Bursch, that if
one allowed same-sex marriage, one would be announcing
to the world that marriage and children have nothing to
do with each other?
MR. BURSCH:  Not -- not in the abstract,
Your Honor.  That kind of example --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, not in the abstract,
not in the concrete.
MR. BURSCH:  Well, let me give you an
example.  We're -- we're talking about something that's
going to change the meaning of the institution over
generations.  And -- and, you know, you have things like
no-fault divorce where we tweaked what marriage means,
and it had consequences over the long term that some
people didn't expect.
I want you to think about two couples that
are identically situated.  They've been married for five
years, and they each have a 3-year-old child.  One grows
up believing that marriage is about keeping that couple
bound to that child forever.  The other couple believes
that that marriage is more about their emotional
commitment to each other, and if that commitment fades,
then they may not stay together.
A reasonable voter, which is what we're
talking about here, could believe that there would be a
different outcome if those two marriages were influenced
by those two different belief systems.  Ideas matter,
Your Honors, and -- and, you know, the out-of-wedlock
birthrate --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that -- that assumes
that same-sex couples could not have the more noble
purpose, and that's the whole point.  Same-sex couples
say, of course, we understand the nobility and the
sacredness of the marriage.  We know we can't procreate,
but we want the other attributes of it in order to show
that we, too, have a dignity that can be fulfilled.
MR. BURSCH:  And Justice --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and -- but you
argued in your brief, and Justice Kagan was quite
correct to -- to say that you're saying that this harms
conventional marriage.  That was the argument you made
in your brief as I understood it.
MR. BURSCH:  Justice Kennedy, to be
perfectly clear, the State of Michigan values the
dignity and worth of every human being, no matter their
orientation or how they choose to live their life.
That's not what this case is about.
Our point is that when you change something
as fundamental as the marriage definition, as Chief
Justice Roberts was saying, the dictionary definition
which has existed for millennia, and you apply that over
generations, that those changes matter.  And it's not
unreasonable --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm sure that's true.  But
I mean, the -- the fact is that -- that X percent, a
very high percent of opposite-sex people don't have
children and everybody knows they can't, and a very --
and a high -- certain percentage, I'm sure probably
pretty of high of those who get married, of same-sex
people who get married do have children.
So -- so where is this going?  I mean, what
are these two couples to do with it?  I mean --
MR. BURSCH:  Well, we're -- we're --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- how do we get from what
I just said --
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  We're -- we're
concerned --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- to some kind of
rational or -- or important distinction?
MR. BURSCH:  What -- we're concerned about
all the children, children of opposite-sex couples and
children of same-sex couples.  There are 73 million
children in this country.  If this Court ensconces in
the Constitution a new definition of marriage and it
reduces the rate that opposite-sex couples stay
together, bound to their children, because of that
different understanding, even a 1 percent change --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what -- what
evidence --
MR. BURSCH:  -- is many, many children.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- is there of that?
MR. BURSCH:  A reasonable voter, again,
looking at those two couples that I just described, one
believing that marriage is all about staying with their
kids, the other one believing it's all about emotion and
commitment, could have different results.  And it's
reasonable to believe that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the problem is that
even under a rational-basis standard, do we accept a
feeling?  I mean, why is -- why as -- and I think
Justice Kagan put the argument quite clearly, with
something as fundamental as marriage, why would that
feeling, which doesn't make any logical sense, control
our decision-making?
MR. BURSCH:  It doesn't make any logical
sense to you that if people think love is -- or a
marriage is more about love and commitment than about
staying bound to your child forever, that there might be
different consequences when people are --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I do think,
Mr. Bursch --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My problem is that I
think people who get into marriage think that,
heterosexual couples.
MR. BURSCH:  I -- I think everyone thinks
that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Everybody has their own
vision of what marriage is, but what the State confers
is certain obligations --
MR. BURSCH:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and they are willing
to accept those.  Whether or not that couple stays
together, they are bound to that child.  They have to
support the child, they have to care for him or her.
Some people choose voluntarily, meaning they just choose
because they don't want to, but that happens in --
whether it's same-sex or heterosexual couples.
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  But -- but what you're
describing are different ways that people think about
marriage, and certainly it's a harm to a child of an
opposite-sex couple if they get divorced as opposed to
stay together forever.  I mean, I think we can all agree
that, in general, that we want kids to stay bound to
their biological mother and father whenever possible.
That's the whole definition.
And what I hear are lots of other --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I -- I think they
should be bound to their parent, because there's a lot
of adopted children and they are not go thinking of
biological moms and dads.
MR. BURSCH:  Oh, sure.  That's a completely
different situation.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know, well --
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  I mean, that -- that's
a situation where the child doesn't have their
biological mom and dad anymore for whatever reason, and
so that's a different State interest.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr Bursch, suppose --
suppose this:  Suppose that there's a State with a very
procreation-centered view of marriage of the kind that
you're talking about.  And it -- you know, so emotional
commitment and support, all of these, the State thinks
are not the purpose of marriage and they want their
marriage licenses to be addressed only to the things
which serve this procreation purpose.  And so they say,
Well, we're not giving marriage licenses to any -- to
anybody who doesn't want children.  So when people come
in and ask for a marriage license, they just ask a
simple question:  Do you want children?  And if the
answer is no, the State says, no marriage license for
you.  Would that be constitutional?
MR. BURSCH:  Well, that would cut against
the State's interest as you've just described it
because even people --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, the State has -- the
State has this -- it's not a perfect correlation, but
the State says that the best -- the best way to promote
this procreation-centered view of marriage is just to
limit marriage to people who want children.  So that's
what it does.  Would that be constitutional?
MR. BURSCH:  But, Justice Kagan, even people
who come into a marriage thinking they don't want to
have children often end up with children.  And that
State's interest isn't binding those--
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but this State --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what is your --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What you said --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is your answer to the
question?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is your answer to the
question?
MR. BURSCH:  Would it be constitutional?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.
MR. BURSCH:  I think it would be an
unconstitutional invasion of privacy to ask the
question.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  To ask if you want children
is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy?
MR. BURSCH:  I -- I think that would be the
case, yes, just like it would be unconstitutional --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose a couple, a
70-year-old couple comes in and they want to get
married.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You don't have to ask
them any questions.  You know they are not going to have
any children.
MR. BURSCH:  Well, a 70-year-old man,
obviously, is still capable of having children and you'd
like keep that within the marriage.
But leaving that aside, what you're talking
about, Justice Ginsburg, is -- is a tailoring issue
under rational basis, which we submit applies here.
Vance and Heller both say that overinclusiveness is not
something you need to worry about.
But even if you applied some kind of
heightened scrutiny, you know, again, many people get
married thinking that they can't have kids or won't have
kids, and they end up with children, and that the
inclusion of those couples advances the State's interest
because of this greater idea.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but you're -- but you're
the one who said that rational basis, pure rational
basis, applies.  And this is a State --
MR. BURSCH:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that's decided that it so
wants this procreation-centered view of marriage, that
it's going to exclude people who don't want children.
It's going to exclude people who can't have children.
And the question is, would that be constitutional?  And
it seems to me it flows directly from your argument that
it would be constitutional.
But the problem is that we hear about those
kinds of restrictions, and every single one of us said
that can't be constitutional.  And I'm suggesting that
the same might be true here.
MR. BURSCH:  That -- that it can't be
constitutional to keep the marriage definition that, as
several Justices have mentioned, has been rationally
applied for millennia in every culture.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  To keep the marriage
definition as -- as you have described it as so
procreation-centered, that a State can exclude everybody
that does not serve that purpose for that reason alone.
And that's the reason you've given.
MR. BURSCH:  That -- that's the primary
interest.  But if you're concerned about the -- the
overinclusiveness, the underinclusiveness, you know,
the -- the Plaintiffs' definition of marriage, other
definition of marriages suffer from that same flaw.
You know, so, for example, the -- the
Plaintiffs' definition also excludes relationships,
families that have already been discussed this morning
that might benefit from having State-recognized
marriage.  It also includes people who have no real
emotional love or commitment towards each other.  They
get married for other reasons.  So if those are the
reasons why the State's definitions --
JUSTICE ALITO:  If the reason --
MR. BURSCH:  -- are invalid --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- the reason for marriage
is to provide a lasting bond between people who love
each other and make a commitment to take care of each
other, I'm not -- do you see a way in which that logic
can be limited to two people who want to have sexual
relations --
MR. BURSCH:  It -- it -- can't be.
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- why that would not extend
to larger groups, the one I mentioned earlier, two men
and two women, or why it would not extend to unmarried
siblings who have the same sort of relationship?
MR. BURSCH:  It would be overinclusive and
underinclusive.  And the underlying point there is that
the State doesn't have an interest in love and emotion
at all.  You know, if Justice Kagan and I have a close
friendship, the government doesn't regulate when that
friendship begins or ends.  But the government's sole
interest in these cases isn't about love.  It's about
binding children to their biological --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's fine.
MR. BURSCH:  -- moms and dads if possible --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'd like to go -- to -- to
direct that.  I -- because I think we can accept that
kind of definition, and simply point out that many gay
people want to have children, and they do.
MR. BURSCH:  Sure.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So it's -- I'm not certain
how that works here, but I'll think about it.
The other thing I -- that you will have a
view on, and will be helpful to me, is there is an
argument being made, if not by the government -- and I'd
like your response to it -- that after all, marriage is
about as basic a right as there is; that the
Constitution and Amendment Fourteen does say you cannot
deprive a person of liberty, certainly of basic liberty,
without due process of law; and that to take a group of
people where so little distinguishes them from the
people you give the liberty to, at least in terms of
a -- of a good reason for not to, and you don't let them
participate in this basic institution, that that
violates the Fourteenth Amendment.
Now, the reason that I'm interested in that
is we don't get into this more scholastic effort to
distinguish between rational basis and middle tier and
some higher tier and so forth.  And it's not going to
get into all these questions of balancing free religion
rights versus gay rights and so forth.  We'd avoid that
in this case.  And perhaps that's wise, if not legally
required, which it may be.  And so I'd like your
response to that aspect of the other side's argument.
MR. BURSCH:  I think with respect to the
right of privacy which you identify, this Court already
answered that -- that question in its majority opinion
in Windsor when you said that the limitation of
marriage --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It wasn't a right of
privacy.  What I said was that the right to be married
is as basic a liberty, as basic a fundamental liberty,
not the right of privacy, the right to be married, which
has existed for all of human civilization, that that is
the right which is fundamental.  And, therefore, when a
State offers that to almost everyone, but excludes a
group -- I'm just repeating myself, but that -- I -- I
want that question answered to the best of your ability,
please.
MR. BURSCH:  I'm using right to privacy
interchangeably with the fundamental right that you're
speaking about.  And in Windsor, this Court said that
the limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples has
always been thought to be fundamental.  And so under
the -- the Glucksberg test, that's dispositive.  Now,
you could change that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Suppose I don't
accept, for argument's sake, your notion that the right
of privacy and the right to be married are the same
thing.  Okay.  Now, we'll deal with my hypothetical,
please.  And my hypothetical is they are different
things.
MR. BURSCH:  Sure.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And on that assumption, I
would like to know what you think of the argument.
MR. BURSCH:  I think Windsor compared with
Glucksberg is dispositive on that because the limitation
on the fundamental right --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I -- you know, the
problem is that I don't actually accept your starting
premise.  The right to marriage is, I think, embedded in
our constitutional law.  It is a fundamental right.
We've said it in a number of cases.
The issue is you can't narrow it down to
say, but is gay marriage fundamental?  Has
black-and-white marriage been treated fundamentally?
The issue was starting from the proposition of, is the
right to marry fundamental?  And then is it compelling
for a State to exclude a group of people?
MR. BURSCH:  And, Justice --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that, for me, is
as -- as simple as the question gets.
MR. BURSCH:  Justice Sotomayor, I'm not
arguing with you or Justice Breyer about how broadly or
narrowly we should be defining the fundamental marriage
right.  I'm simply pointing out that under this Court's
long-established precedent in the fundamental rights
area, which is designed to create a balance where
Federal courts aren't always interfering with the State
democratic process, that in Windsor, you already
answered that question.  It doesn't matter how broadly
or narrowly we define it.  What's been fundamentally
understood as a limitation is the opposite sex nature of
marriage.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I'm -- I'm
not sure it's necessary to get into sexual orientation
to resolve the case.  I mean, if Sue loves Joe and Tom
loves Joe, Sue can marry him and Tom can't.  And the
difference is based upon their different sex.  Why isn't
that a straightforward question of sexual
discrimination?
MR. BURSCH:  Two reasons.  All of this
Court's landmark precedents in this area in sexual
discrimination law have always involved treating classes
of men and women differently.  And that's not what we
have here.
But -- but even more fundamentally than
that, this Court has recognized in Nguyen v. INS that
it's appropriate to draw lines based on sex if it's
related to biology.  And if you'll indulge me just for a
minute, the Nguyen case really is important here.
You'll recall that's the case where you had a law that
determined citizenship of children born to divorced
or -- or unmarried individuals overseas.  And the law
said if it was the child of a citizen mother, then they
automatically had citizenship, but if it was the father,
then the father had to, one, prove paternity and, two,
make child support payments up to age 18.  And that's an
obvious sex discrimination.  And the Court said --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, the Court -- the --
the Court -- the Court's rationale for that was we know
who the mother is.  We're fearful that the father is
claiming to be the father for some benefits that he's
going to get from that status, but we can't be sure he
is the father.
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  Justice Ginsburg, that
was the justification for the prove the parenthood.  But
I would like to -- to quote from the opinion about the
second interest, the -- the child support.
The Court said that the government had an
important interest in ensuring an opportunity to have a
meaningful parent-child relationship between that
biological father and a child.  And the law
substantially advanced that interest, and this is why,
and I'm going to quote.
"It is almost axiomatic that a policy which
seeks to foster the opportunity for meaningful
parent-child bonds to develop has a close and
substantial bearing on the governmental interest in the
actual formation of that bond."
And that is the exact same interest that the
Respondents are advancing here when they talk about the
definition of marriage, which from --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's not -- it -- in the
Nguyen case, the father could get the status of a
parent.  He just had to do some things that the mother
didn't have to do.  It wasn't difficult.
Here it's a total exclusion.  And in the
Nguyen case, the -- the father was complaining that he
shouldn't have to do anything other than what a mother
did, and the Court said, yeah, you do have to do
something.  It's not much.
MR. BURSCH:  But -- but the gist of the
Court's opinion, Justice Ginsburg, was that the State
had an interest in the biological father-child bond, not
only improving it, but also ensuring that it's
sustained.  It advanced the exact same interest that the
States have when they try to inextricably bind kids to
their biological moms and dads.  And -- and if you
change that meaning, over the long haul, it has
consequences.  You know, I -- I started to say a few
minutes ago that the out-of-wedlock birth rate in this
country has gone from 10 percent to 40 percent from 1970
to today.  And I think everybody would agree that that's
not a good result for children.  And to the extent that
you're changing the meaning of marriage --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that wasn't changed
because of the recent gay marriages.
MR. BURSCH:  No.  I'm not saying that at
all.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In Massachusetts, we've
got data that it's -- the rates have remained constant
since they changed their laws.
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  But as several Justices
have noted, you know, that's a very short time frame.
The whole idea of same-sex marriage --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but you're the one
that brought the statistic up, and under --
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  But listen --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and under your
view, it would be very difficult for same-sex couples to
adopt some of these children.  I -- I think the argument
cuts quite against you.
MR. BURSCH:  Well, what -- what I'm
talking --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and it goes back to
the basic point where you began where you had some
premise that only opposite-sex couples can have a
bonding with the child.  That's -- that was very
interesting, but it's just a wrong premise.
MR. BURSCH:  No.  That's not my premise.
The premise is that we want to encourage children to be
bonded to their biological mother and father.  We don't
deny at all -- disagree at all that same-sex couples can
be bonded to their children.  We hope that's the case.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you see, this is what
I think is -- is difficult for some people with your
argument, is that it's hard to see how permitting
same-sex marriage discourages people from being bonded
with their biological children.  So if you would explain
that to me.
MR. BURSCH:  Because if you're changing the
meaning of marriage from one where it's based on that
biological bond to one where it's based on emotional
commitment, then adults could think, rightly, that this
relationship is more about adults and not about the
kids.  Not the case with the Plaintiffs in this case.
We all agree that they are bonded to their kids and have
their best interest at heart.
But when we're talking about, Justice
Kennedy, over decades, when laws change, when societal
views on marriage change, there are consequences to
that.  And -- and what this comes down to is whether
you -- not whether you agree or disagree with me or a
reasonable voter on whether that could happen.  It's
whether, in drawing these policy lines -- you know,
every marriage definition excludes and includes some
people.  You know, the possible harm is when you change
that definition, is that something --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's the same point.  What
directly is your response to the fact that if we assume
a basic purpose of marriage is to encourage an emotional
and rearing bond between parents and children, that
allowing gay people to marry will weaken it?  After all,
some non-gay couples have children, many, and some
don't.  And some gay people married have children, and
some don't.  So what's the empirical connection?  That's
what I have a problem with in your argument.
MR. BURSCH:  Justice Breyer, it's relatively
simple.  If you de-link marriage from creating children,
you would expect to have more children created outside
the bonds of marriage.  And a reasonable voter -- that's
government conduct; right?  If -- if -- right now, take
a --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the empirical part
of what you just said?  If you believe that marriage
is -- you -- I just heard you say it, but I didn't
follow it.
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  Because you're changing
slightly the State's interest.  You're -- you're talking
about the State's interest in bonding parents and
children generally.  And if that was the interest that
motivated this -- this definition to come into being,
there would be a different answer to that.  Just like
if --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But I've never heard of a
State that said, it is our State policy that we don't
like adoption.  I've heard of many States who say it's
very important to treat adopted children the same way
that you treat natural children.  I've never heard the
contrary.
MR. BURSCH:  Yes, we -- we agree.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So if your argument depends
upon that, I'm stuck.
MR. BURSCH:  Let me be very clear about
that.  We love adoption.  Adopted parents are heroic.
There you are talking about children who have, for
whatever reason, death, disability, abuse, have already
been separated from their biological mom and dad, and so
when we're talking about adoption, that's an entirely
different social issue that gets solved with different
State interests.  What we're talking about here is that
world where there is no marriage --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, you know, they are
connected, right?  Because if you think about --
MR. BURSCH:  Oh, they're related.  Sure.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  If you think about the
potential -- who are the potential adoptive parents,
many of them are same-sex parents who can't have their
own children, and truly want to experience exactly the
kind of bond that you're talking about.  So how does it
make those children better off by preventing that from
happening?
MR. BURSCH:  Well, we allow someone
regardless of their sexual orientation to adopt.
That's, again, a very different --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  But you, yourself, are
saying that the marriage -- the -- the recognition of
marriage helps the children, aren't you?  I mean, you'd
rather have -- the whole basis of your argument is that
you want children in marital households.
MR. BURSCH:  Correct.  We -- we want it to
be the glue.  That's correct.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  More -- more adopted
children and more marital households, whether same sex
or other sex seems to be a good thing.
MR. BURSCH:  Well, that -- that's a policy
argument, and reasonable people can disagree simply and
compassionately.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I'm just asking based
on your policy how it's not a good thing.  I'm not
trying to put words in your mouth.  I'm just saying
if -- if -- it just seems to me inexplicable given what
you've said are your policy interests.
MR. BURSCH:  Because if you change the
societal meaning of what marriage is -- and society has
already started to move away from what we always
understood marriage to be, that linkage between kids and
their biological mom and dad.  The more that link is
separated, the more likely it is that when you've got an
opposite-sex couple, that link will not be maintained,
because it's more adult-centric, and it's less
child-centric.
You've got more kids being raised without
their biological mom and dad.  You have more kids being
raised without both parents, you know, typically,
without a father, though that's not always the case.
And it's not unreasonable for the people in thinking
about the possible consequences of changing a
definition, which has existed, as Justice Kennedy said,
for millennia, might have real consequences.  To say
otherwise is to say that it's irrational for a person to
think that changing an idea about something will have no
effect about -- on how people think about that idea.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We have changed our idea
about marriage is the point that I made earlier.
Marriage today is not what it was under the
common law tradition, under the civil law tradition.
Marriage was a relationship of a dominant male to a
subordinate female.
That ended as a result of this Court's
decision in 1982 when Louisiana's Head and Master Rule
was struck down.  And no State was allowed to have such
a -- such a marriage anymore.  Would that be a choice
that a State should be allowed to have?
MR. BURSCH:  No.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  To cling to marriage the
way it once was?
MR. BURSCH:  No.  Absolutely not, because
there the State didn't have a legitimate interest in
making anyone subservient to anyone else.  But here the
State's entire interest springs out of the fact that we
want to forever link children with their biological mom
and dad when that's possible.
And, you know, I want to get back to this
point of line drawing, and the marriage definition that
the Plaintiffs and the Federal government proposed.  You
know, and how, no matter where you draw the lines,
they're going to leave someone out, too.  And what they
are asking you to do is to take an institution, which
was never intended to be dignitary bestowing, and make
it dignitary bestowing.  That's their whole argument.
And when you do that, tens of thousands of other
children who don't meet their definition will likewise
be left out and suffer those exact same dignitary harms.
When you're talking about a spectrum of
marriage definitions, different places to draw the line,
and potential harms on both sides, that is the
quintessential place for the democratic process to work.
And there's another harm --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just in -- just in
fairness to you, I don't understand this not dignity
bestowing.  I thought that was the whole purpose of
marriage.  It bestows dignity on both man and woman in a
traditional marriage.
MR. BURSCH:  It's supposed to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's dignity bestowing,
and these parties say they want to have that -- that
same ennoblement.
MR. BURSCH:  Sure.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or am I missing your
point?
MR. BURSCH:  I think you're missing my
point.  If we go back to that world where marriage
doesn't exist and the State is trying to figure out how
do we link together these kids with their biological
moms and dads when possible, the -- the glue are
benefits and burdens, but not necessarily dignity.
You know, dignity may have grown up around
marriage as a cultural thing, but the State has no
interest in bestowing or taking away dignity from
anyone, and certainly it's not the State's intent to
take dignity away from same-sex couples or -- or from
anyone based on their sexual orientation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I think many States
would be surprised, with reference to traditional
marriages, they are not enhancing the dignity of both
the parties.  I'm puzzled by that.  But you have another
point to make.
MR. BURSCH:  Well, the -- the main point
there is -- is the State's don't intend to bestow
dignity, but if you turn it into a dignity bestowing
institution, then other family structures and children
who are excluded from their definition would suffer a
dignitary harm.  You know, so you can't draw the line
there.
And -- and when you're talking about
balancing harms and the importance of letting people
decide the most fundamental of questions, how do we
define marriage in our society, it has other, you know,
important things to think about as well.
You know, one of those is that when people
have to act through the democratic process, it forces
neighbors to sit down and civilly discuss an issue and
try to persuade each other through reason, love and
logic.  And we have already seen that happen in eleven
States, and if you read some accounts, that could happen
in many more very quickly.  When you enact social change
of this magnitude through the Federal courts, it's
cutting off that dialogue and it's saying one group gets
their definition and the other is maligned as being
irrational or filled with animus.  And that's not the
way that our democratic process is supposed to work and
there are long-term harms to our country and to that
fundamental liberty interest to govern ourselves.  All
the things that this Court talked about in -- in the
Schuette decision, if you take away that dynamic, if
it's a court-imposed definition as opposed to one
enacted by the people through the democratic process.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Of course -- I mean, of
course, Mr. Bursch, we don't live in a pure democracy;
we live in a constitutional democracy.  And the
constitutional -- the Constitution imposes limits on
what people can do and this is one of those cases -- we
see them every day -- where we have to decide what those
limits are or whether the Constitution speaks to
something and prevents the democratic processes from
operating purely independently; isn't that right?
MR. BURSCH:  It is right.  But, Justice
Kagan, as we discussed in our brief and as we've seen in
the argument here today, you know, there isn't a
constitutional limit that tells people, one, the
marriage definition that they've had for millennia is so
irrational that it's unconstitutional.  We haven't seen
that under this Court's sex discrimination jurisprudence
that these laws shouldn't -- should be struck down.
Under the fundamental rights doctrine, Windsor already
resolved that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but that's the question,
is whether there are these equality limits or whether
there are these liberty limits.
So let's go back to the liberty limits that
you were just talking about.
MR. BURSCH:  Sure.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, the right to marry.
We've had -- we had Loving.  We had Zablocki.  We had
Turner.  In all of these cases what we've talked about
is a right to marry.  We didn't try to define the right
more particularly:  Is there a right to interracial
marriage?  Is there a right to marry if you're a
prisoner?  We just said there's a right to marry, that
is fundamental and that everybody is entitled to it
unless there's some good reason for the State to exclude
it -- exclude them.  So why shouldn't we adopt the exact
same understanding here?
MR. BURSCH:  Well, you walked through those
same cases that you just mentioned, you know, Skinner,
Maynard, Griswold, Loving, Zablocki -- reemphasize
Loving itself -- every single one of those talked about
marriage in the context of men and women coming together
and creating children, procreative interest.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, they were dealing then
with men and women coming together, but the question
was, well, there might be a black woman and a -- and a
black man or a white woman or a black woman and a white
man and -- and there was no inquiry into whether that
was a traditional form of marriage.  If there had been
such an inquiry in this country, they would have come up
pretty short.
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  And historically, that
wasn't part of the tradition, and more importantly,
invidious discrimination --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Historically, it was not a
part of the tradition, that's right.  And the Court
said --
MR. BURSCH:  Can I finish the answer?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- irrelevant that that's
not a part of the tradition because --
MR. BURSCH:  Right.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- because there's no good
reason for it not to be part of the next tradition.
MR. BURSCH:  Because invidious
discrimination based on race had absolutely nothing to
do with the States' interest in linking children to
their biological moms and dads --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Loving was very
clearly -- Loving was very clearly not just a racial
case, that -- it also was a -- a liberty case?
MR. BURSCH:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And in, indeed, Loving was
exactly what this case is.  It's a case which shows how
liberty and -- and equality are intertwined, wasn't it?
MR. BURSCH:  No.  Because in Loving, if the
couple could not get married, they could not have --
they could not enjoy private intimacy at all because it
was subject to criminal prosecution and jail time.  And
in fact, all of these cases that we've been talking
about where this Court recognized a fundamental right to
marriage, there were other laws that prohibited
nonmarital cohabitation --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, what -- what did
that have to do with prisoners?  If the States' interest
is in fostering procreation between natural parents,
the -- it seems to me that the prison who -- at issue
did that.  It said you can get married if there's a
child on the way.  And that would foster the -- or -- or
promote the interest.
We, instead, said, that's not enough.  The
fundamental right to marry does bestow an important --
an important connection that we can't deprive the
prisoner of, even if the prisoner at least at the moment
and presumably those serving life sentences, have no
chance of procreation.
MR. BURSCH:  Justice Sotomayor, as you're
well aware, this Court actually decided two prisoner
cases.  One was Taylor, the one I think you were
referring to; the other is Butler.  This Court in Taylor
said even someone in prison who has an expectation of
getting out someday has a right to consummate their
marriage.  In Butler, you said when someone's serving a
life sentence, it's appropriate for the State to deny
them the opportunity to marry because they never had
that opportunity.  So even there, you -- you were tying
the State interest that we're asserting here to
marriage.
And -- and let -- let's take away all laws
regarding cohabitation and -- and intimacy outside of
marriage so that there is no criminal conduct, the
underlay for all those things.
If the State today decided to have no
marriage, as some States have proposed, that wouldn't
violate a fundamental right.  The fundamental right at
stake in those cases was the right to be left alone, not
the right, as Chief Justice Roberts intimated in the
first part of this argument, to force the government to
come into your home and recognize something and -- and
to give you benefits.  Those are two very different
things.
And -- and you can draw the analogy to the
abortion context.  And I'm reluctant to bring that up,
but, you know, in Roe v. Wade and Casey, this Court says
the government cannot interfere in that private choice.
That's a fundamental right.  In Maher, the Court says
but a woman cannot force the government to come
participate in that by paying for it.
Likewise here.  Lawrence said the government
cannot interfere in private, intimate conduct.  Our
position is that the Court cannot, as a constitutional
matter, say but yes, you can force the State into these
relationships by -- by forcing them to recognize and
give benefits to anyone.  That's not the way that our
fundamental rights doctrine works.
So, Justice Kagan, you know, to get back to
your point again about how the Constitution does put
limits, there haven't been any identifiable limits here
that -- that defeat the States' interest.  You would
have to somehow change one of those doctrines.  You'd
have to change your fundamental rights doctrine.  You'd
have to change equal protection doctrine.  And when you
change those, you also change the balance between the
Federal courts and the people voting in the democratic
process.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  See, to me it seems as
though you are doing something very different that we've
never done before, which is you are defining
constitutional rights in terms of the kinds of people
that can exercise them.  And I don't think we've really
ever done that.  Where we've seen a constitutional
right, we have not defined it by these people can
exercise it, but these people can't, especially in a
case where the claims are both rights-based and
equality-based.
I mean, it would be like saying in Lawrence,
well, there's only a right to intimate activity for
heterosexual people and not a right to intimate sexual
activity for gays and lesbians.  And, of course, we
didn't do that.  Once we understood that there was a
right to engage in intimate activity, it was a right for
everybody.
MR. BURSCH:  Absolutely.  But that's the
State's whole point, is that we're not drawing
distinctions based on the identity, the orientation, or
the choices of anyone.  The State has drawn lines, the
way the government has always done, to solve a specific
problem.  It's not meant to exclude.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it must be --
MR. BURSCH:  It's not meant to take away
dignity.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It must be.  That's
why you're drawing distinctions based on sexual
orientation in these laws.
MR. BURSCH:  Oh, gosh, no, because the --
the State doesn't care about your sexual orientation.
What the State cares about is that biological reality.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not asking about -- I'm
not asking about your reasons and whether you have any
or not.  But whether you have any or not, you are
drawing distinctions based on sexual orientation.
That's what -- that's what these laws do.
MR. BURSCH:  No.  A statute that facially
classified based on sexual orientation would look very
different.  What these statutes do is they have
disparate impact, and you would have to demonstrate them
under Washington v. Davis and Feeney that there's some
animus that motivates this.  And this Court has said
repeatedly in Ling and O'Brien and other contexts --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It is not to start an
impact.  It's leaving a group out altogether.  It's not
that more of this group and less of that group.
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  But as you said in --
in Bray v. Alexandria, a 100 percent impact doesn't
necessarily mean animus.  We still have to determine
a -- a discriminatory intent.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What did -- what did we say
in Bray?  Something about if you prevent people from
wearing yarmulkes, you know that it's discrimination
against Jews.  Isn't that what we said in Bray?  Same
thing here.
MR. BURSCH:  The Bray v. Alexandria case
that I was talking about was the one that affected
abortion and your ability to have that, which on
its surface affects 100 percent of women.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Sorry, the case that I'm
talking about said what I said.
MR. BURSCH:  Right.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  Should I read anything
other than -- I'll certainly go back and read Windsor
again and I'll certainly go and read Glucksberg again.
I do recall the cases, at least generally, and I don't
believe there's anything in those cases that says the
basic liberty or right to be married is a right that
extends only to opposite-sex couples.  Those -- those
weren't really issues in the case as they are here, so
I'm surprised if this Court actually wrote that, but --
but if it did write that and you can immediately call
that page to mind, I'll doubly look at it.  And I just
doubt it's there, but I'll look at it.
MR. BURSCH:  I apologize for not having the
page cite, but --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  That's quite all
right.  I'll read the whole opinion.
MR. BURSCH:  Yeah.  You will find in Windsor
that the Court majority said it's the limitation of
marriage to opposite-sex couples that has always been
thought fundamental.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's the limitation, fine.
Okay.
MR. BURSCH:  Yes.  You know, so what -- what
we're talking about here is having to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that was then and
this is now.
JUSTICE BREYER:  How could the limitation --
the right has -- the fundamental right has to be a right
to marry and you said it's the limitation --
MR. BURSCH:  This Court acknowledged --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did Justice Breyer join
that opinion that said that?
MR. BURSCH:  I -- I believe he did.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  My Lord.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I -- sometimes, you
know, context matters.  I'll go in.
MR. BURSCH:  If I could briefly continue.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm surprised we have this
case in front of us if that -- I mean, if it's been so
clearly decided, but --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you want wrap up,
counsel?
MR. BURSCH:  I -- I do want to wrap up.
Your Honors, these are obviously very
emotional issues where reasonable people can disagree.
This Court has never assumed that people have act out of
animus when they're voting in the democratic process.
The -- the States generally, Michigan
specifically, has -- has no animus.  It doesn't intend
to take away dignity from anyone.  We respect all
parents, and we hope that they love their children.
But this Court taking this important issue
away from the people will have dramatic impacts on the
democratic process, and we ask that you affirm.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Bonauto, you have three minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARY L. BONAUTO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 1
MS. BONAUTO:  First, I just want to say that
the idea that the ideas of marriage will change is a
false dichotomy.  Right now, different-sex couples can
choose to marry and rear children.  They can choose to
marry at 70 or 90 because of their commitment to one
other.  We honor both marriages.  It is only same-sex
couples who are foreclosed from marrying under either
vision.
Second, we agree that these restrictions
are, in fact, linked to gender.  There's official
classification here, and they are sex linked in an
additional way, and that is ideas about what is a proper
relationship for a man to have, a real man or a real
woman, and that is obviously not with a person of the
same sex.
I hear that Michigan loves adoption, and, in
fact, Michigan has placed intensely vulnerable children
with these petitioners who have nurtured them to a
healthy childhood.  Does Michigan deny the marriage
because they didn't conceive those children together,
when Michigan would let other adoptive parents who are a
different-sex couple marry?  No.  Michigan is drawing a
line because it does not approve of the adult
relationship, no matter what the protestations they
follow.
Next, we hear a line it's not disrespectful
because it's drawn based on biology.  I have to say one
casualty of the marriage litigation is an impoverished
view of what is marriage and what is the role of
biological procreation.  The State's entire premise here
is that if same-sex couples marry, then different-sex
couples won't and have their children in a marriage.
Those two could not be further apart.  People make their
own decisions.  It is beyond attenuated.
And the idea also that there are other
people who raise children -- and good for them, it's
something, of course, that I hope policymakers would
support.  But it's adult relationships that we're
talking about at the foundation here are different adult
relationships, and telling same-sex couples who have
made that commitment to one another and have committed
to raising children that they can't is what is
stigmatizing.
And then, if I may, my -- my last point is
that the only way I can really understand Michigan's
points about procreation and biology and so on is when I
look, for example, at page 31 of their brief.  And they
say that what they care about is people who have
children together staying together and providing a
long-term, stable situation for their children.
That interest applies full force in this
context, because by denying marriage to same-sex
couples, you are denying not only the protection for the
adults, which is independently important, you are
denying those protections and that security that would
come from having married parents.
So with that, thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The Court will take a brief break and return
to the bench in five minutes for argument on the second
question presented.
(Short break at 11:32 a.m.)
