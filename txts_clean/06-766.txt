CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first today in Case 06-766, New York State Board of
Elections v. Torres.
Mr. Olson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK STATE
BOARD OF ELECTIONS, ET AL.
MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
For 10 years, New York relied on political
party primaries to nominate general election candidates
for supreme court justice, but that process discouraged
qualified candidates and spawned unseemly, expensive,
and potentially corrupting fundraising by judicial
candidates.
So the legislature substituted an indirect
party primary system at which delegates are elected who,
in turn, select general election candidates at political
party conventions.
The Second Circuit concluded that the
delegate convention statutes enabled political parties
to exercise too much influence at the expense of the
insurgent party members or insurgent candidates and
struck those statutes down as facially unconstitutional
and reinstated the discredited primary process.
The issue in this case is whether the
delegate-convention system is facially unconstitutional
because it allows party leaders to defeat the
aspirations of party insurgents.
States have broad, as this case has
repeatedly held -- broad constitutional latitude to
prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections,
particularly elections for State office.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just focus on, if you
would, Mr. Olson, on the election for the delegates.
Now, suppose it were shown -- a hypothetical
case -- that it's extremely difficult to get on that
ballot. You need, let's say, 2,000 signatures in 30
days. Would there be a constitutional issue raised by
that situation?
MR. OLSON: Well, in the first place, as you
know, Justice Kennedy, that -- that is not the case
here. It takes 500 signatures --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: A hypothetical case.
MR. OLSON: If it were an impossible burden
to get on the ballot, I still don't think that First
Amendment associational rights would be involved.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about Kusper, the
Kusper case?
MR. OLSON: I don't think the Kusper case
goes that far, Justice Kennedy. I think that, as the
cases of this Court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think we have made it
very clear that if you're going to use a primary system,
you can't have such burdensome registration requirements
that the primary system is not, to all intents and
purposes, to all intents and purposes open to those who
wish to participate.
MR. OLSON: I think that the other factor
that is involved here is that, provided that there is
reasonable access to the general election, which is
another factor in this case, then the constitutional
rights to associate are satisfied.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think that in
Kusper, if -- if there was reasonable access to a
general election, you can structure and stifle the
primary any way --
MR. OLSON: Well, I think that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just looking at the
principle here, and it may be that you'll say that
there's no burden here, et cetera. But I just want to
know: Isn't there a constitutional principle that we
are entitled and we must look at the fairness of the
primary system insofar as participation of the voters?
MR. OLSON: I think that the case that maybe
best answers that is the Munro case, in which the State
of Washington's practice -- and there was a different
practice of the State of Washington before this Court
earlier this week. But at that point in time the
process was that there was an open blanket primary,
which was not held unconstitutional at that point, where
the major candidates -- the one and two positions of the
major candidates of each of the political parties would
get on the ballot, and then the Socialist Party was
complaining because it took 1 percent of the votes of
the primary process to get on the general election
ballot.
This Court held that that -- that that was
not an impossible burden, and that -- the principle from
that case and the other cases, the American political --
American Party of Texas v. White and so forth, the
Court's jurisprudence has held that, as long as there is
reasonable access for a candidate or a political party
to the general election process, then it does not have
to be provided in that level in the primary.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it right to
regard the election of delegates here as a primary
election?
My understanding, of course, is that that
simply elects -- it doesn't get you on the ballot. It
elects delegates who then exercise the choice. Do you
think our primary election cases are transferable to
this situation?
MR. OLSON: Well, I think there are two
answers to that. Your primary election cases talk in
terms of, the ones that have been mentioned in the
briefs here, talk particularly in terms of protection
under the Equal Protection Clause.
This is -- it's called a primary, but it's
an election of delegates by party members that -- and
then, when those delegates get together, they go to the
convention. So I'm not sure that the nomenclature makes
so much difference as this is a process that the State
has allowed the party to implement to choose its
leadership. The Court has repeatedly held that there is
no point in the process --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The State has not allowed
it. The State has required it, no?
MR. OLSON: Yes, the State requires it, but
it --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Although if we -- if we
hold it unconstitutional for the State to require it, I
suppose it would also be unconstitutional for the State
merely to allow it, wouldn't it? So that this manner of
selecting judges in any other State, if it has been
voluntarily adopted by the party, would be
unconstitutional?
MR. OLSON: That's the principle that the
Respondents in the Second Circuit advance. It would
strike down the conventions, because conventions are, by
definition, selections of individuals to represent the
broader constituency at a subsequent --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just to make it clear, is
it your position that, with reference to this election
for delegates, the State can make it as burdensome as it
chooses on those who wish to put themselves forward on
the ballot as a proposed delegate?
MR. OLSON: I think, Justice Kennedy, as
long as the system in the State provides a reasonable
access to candidates and political parties to the
election process, that there is not a First Amendment
right with respect to the primary process or the
preliminary process, which in this case includes both
the so-called delegate selection primary --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if it were
the parties that objected to this and not some
individual who said, I'm not being given enough voice in
the party? What if the parties said, we don't want to
select our candidates this way? Is it clear that the
State could impose it upon them?
MR. OLSON: It's clear the State has the
right, and this Court has said so in the American Party
of Texas v. White, that the State can require either a
primary election or a convention. The Court
specifically addressed that. In fact, what the Court
said: It is too plain for argument that a State may
insist that intraparty competition be settled by primary
or convention. That's the holding of that Court --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That convention --
conventions can come in all sizes and shapes. The
argument here is that this system shuts out
rank-and-file party members and gives the total control
to the party leaders, and that the preliminary was the
primary or selection of delegates, but it's really a
sham because nobody is going to run for that except the
party faithful, someone picked by the party boss.
So the argument on the other side is
that this system, as complicated as it is, reduces to
the party leaders choose the candidates.
MR. OLSON: Well, what this Court has said
in the California Republican Party v. Jones case, a cite
quoting the Eu case, the Eu case that the Court had
decided before, is that the political party has the
right to select its leadership, to select its nominating
process, to select its candidates, and to exclude
members. So, Justice Ginsburg, the party has the right,
even arbitrarily, as long as the Fourteenth Amendment is
not violated in an election context, to exclude members
of its party.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the State can
restrict that right if it wants to. The State can
require the party to select its candidates by -- by
primary.
MR. OLSON: By primary or -- or by
convention.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Or by convention.
MR. OLSON: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But if the State wants to
do it by smoke -- if the party wants to do it by
smoke-filled room, the State can say, if it wishes to
say, you can't do it by smoke-filled room.
MR. OLSON: It can, Justice Scalia, but the
State must respect the rights of the political parties
in determining who their leaders and candidates must be.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that -- but
that's not the issue here. The State and the party are
in agreement.
MR. OLSON: Yes. Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The State is not trying to
coerce the party into doing something that it doesn't
want to do.
MR. OLSON: Yes, I totally agree with you.
But I'm answering hypothetical questions with respect to
something else. What this Court has said, that this
Court vigorously protects the special place the First
Amendment reserves for the protection by which a party,
political party, selects a standard-bearer. Selecting a
candidate is selecting the person that will communicate
the party's interests --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the party is -- you're
identifying the party with the party leader because the
argument comes down to this is not the rank and file
that's making this election; this is the party leader;
and the party might like that or the leadership might
like that, but the rank and file might not, and the
argument is that they have rights of association, too.
MR. OLSON: Well, they have rights of
association, but they have -- they have associated in a
political party which has elected leadership which makes
decisions, Justice Ginsburg.
They do not have a right to belong to the
Democratic Party or the Republican Party. The rank and
file, so forth -- the definition of "insurgent," which
is at the other side of the table here, are people that
are rebelling against the duly elected leadership of the
political party.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if there is a
State-mandated primary, I thought it's basic law that
the State may not place unduly restrictive barriers to
participation in that primary. I think that's a given,
it seems to me. Now, tell me if I'm wrong --
MR. OLSON: I may be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And then we can argue
about whether the burden is too great here, which it may
not be.
MR. OLSON: Let me say, Justice Kennedy,
that I may be wrong in terms of what this Court's
decisions stand for with respect to ultimately allowing,
as far as associational rights are concerned,
individuals and parties access to the total electorate.
But even if your premise is correct that there must be
an open access in a reasonable way to either the -- to
both the primary and the general election, then this
process is reasonable. It's not unreasonably difficult
for a person to participate.
Let me say -- let me enumerate the ways. An
individual, a rank-and-file member, can campaign and
vote for delegates. An individual might become a
delegate himself by -- or herself, by getting 500 names
on a signature, and that's far below what this Court has
indicated before was -- was an acceptable level of
requirement of access to the ballot. An individual can
attempt to form delegate slates, can attempt to persuade
the delegates, can -- the individual can form or switch
parties.
In this case the Respondent Lopez Torres,
actually in the 2003 election, became a candidate at the
general election for supreme court justice of the
Working Families Party, and she did that without giving
up her registration and membership in the Democratic
Party. She was in that election and she lost.
Finally, and this is even if she hadn't been able to
secure the nomination of that political party, she could
run in the general election. There's access to -- it
takes 3500 to 4,000 signatures to run as an independent
body in the general election.
So there is way after way after way for
individuals in New York to participate in the election
process.
So in answer to your question,
Justice Kennedy, to the extent that your statement of
the principle with respect to access to both the primary
and the general election is -- is the law of this Court,
then that access exists here.
But I come back to the point that political
parties have the greatest possible latitude -- yes,
Justice Scalia, that the Court has upheld certain
restrictions with respect to how the nominee of the
party gets selected. But the Court has also said that
when the party is in that process, its powers and rights
and First Amendment freedoms to elect the
standard-bearer, to select the standard-bearer, are at
their apogee, because the person selected as a
candidate, whether that person might be the most
favorable person to the rank and file, the duly elected
leadership of the political party might decide, well,
that person really isn't qualified to be a supreme court
justice even --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Have we -- have we imposed
any such restrictions on our own, as opposed to merely
upholding restrictions that were imposed by the State?
That is to say, have we held that the Constitution
itself imposes certain restrictions?
MR. OLSON: Except in the context of
analyzing what State requirements have been?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I want a case where
the State did not impose the restriction and it was up
to us to decide whether the State could do that or not,
but rather the State said the party can do whatever it
wants, and we have disallowed what the party itself
chose under no compulsion from the State --
MR. OLSON: Aside --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- on the basis of some
constitutional principle apart from the Equal Protection
Clause --
MR. OLSON: Yes. The only cases --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- or the Thirteenth
amendment.
MR. OLSON: The only cases that I would
submit, that I'm aware of, that would answer that would
be Equal Protection Clause cases, because the --
these -- the political party is a group of people that
decide to form together because of common beliefs. In
the -- that is the maximum freedom that we allow for
associations.
With all the business about smoke-filled
rooms and things like that, people have the right to
decide, make decisions --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think a political
party could say, you can't vote in our primary unless
you've been a member of our party for 4 years?
MR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Kennedy. I -- I
don't -- in an association --
--
JUSTICE KENNEDY: This would be a
State-mandated party primary for --
MR. OLSON: Well, a party might --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- election --
MR. OLSON: A party would -- there's two
questions there. If the party wants to have a 4-year
requirement before you can be a part of that
association, I can't understand what the First Amendment
associational right would be.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what about --
MR. OLSON: If the State imposed that, the
party could say, well, that's unreasonable; we want to
open -- in fact, the Court decided this by saying that
the --- the party who wanted to could allow independents
to vote.
If I might, Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve
JUSTICE STEVENS: Didn't Justice Kennedy
asked if the Kusper case was correctly decided?
MR. OLSON: Well, I'm not -- I think I tried
to answer that the best I could by saying that I think
the import of the cases, without getting into the
specifics of that, are that if you have a reasonable
access by individuals or political parties to the
electoral process, that satisfies the Constitution.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Olson.
Mr. Rossman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. ROSSMAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK COUNTY
DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE ET AL.
MR. ROSSMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I'd like to begin by responding to
Justice Kennedy's question regarding the election of
delegates and fairness for voters. There are two
responses: In this case that I have -- this case, there
was conceded below that the requirement for delegates of
getting only 500 signatures was no barrier at all.
And secondly, I would say that in
considering that question, Justice Kennedy, the
important thing is to consider what is the intended role
that the State gives to the participants in this
process? And what the role here is that individual
voters have the opportunity to vote for local delegates
who are to represent their interests at the convention.
As Cousins instructs, once they have the opportunity to
pull a lever for the delegate that shares their values
and their preferences, their right of suffrage is
satisfied.
What they do not have, what Respondents and
what the lower courts would like to have exist but
doesn't exist and isn't required under the Constitution,
is the opportunity for rank-and-file voters to vote
directly for the candidates at the nomination stage, and
that's the difference between a delegate-based
convention and a primary.
If we agree, and I think the Court would
agree, that there is no right to a primary -- that's
something, in fact, that's conceded in this case; there
is no constitutional right to a primary -- then there is
no State requirement that there be a direct opportunity
for association between voter and candidate at the
nomination phase; that it is perfectly appropriate and
constitutional for that association to be between voter
and delegate, and the voters then rely on their locally-
elected delegates to advance their interest in the
convention process.
That's the difference between a convention
and a primary. We think it's a critical one here. So
the cases --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In practice, how many
people other than the slate selected by the party
leaders run in New York for this delegate position?
MR. ROSSMAN: In New York City, the evidence
below was that approximately 12 to 13 percent of
delegate slates are contested. What we suggest is that
the availability of a contest is the key. It's not the
frequency of the contest, because there's also evidence
in the record that for open primaries for civil court,
which is the closest parallel, that those are only
contested 28 percent of the time.
So the fact that an election is not
contested, that there may be voter apathy out there,
that there may be party unity that causes people to
rally behind the parties and their leadership, is not a
constitutional problem.
JUSTICE BREYER: The theory of this, I take
it, is that, just as you said, voters elect convention
delegates, and those convention delegates choose the
official nominee, say, of the Democratic Party. So that
nominee goes on to the final ballot.
MR. ROSSMAN: Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what then of the fact
that the convention delegates when they meet won't let
people who would like the position of the judge appear
before them?
MR. ROSSMAN: Well, that is not the general
case in the State of New York.
JUSTICE BREYER: It's not?
MR. ROSSMAN: But even if it is, the
important thing is not that individual candidates appear
to politic before the delegates, it's that delegates
have the freedom under the statute to vote for whatever
candidate they like. There's evidence that there's
legislative intent that, in fact, candidates not appear
at the convention because it would be unseemly for them
to do so.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well then, how are the
delegates to find out the qualifications? In other
words, if that's the intent of this statute, then you
have a statute that's designed on the one hand to have
convention delegates who will choose, and on the other
hand to prevent the convention delegates from finding
out the qualifications of the different applicants, in
which case it would seem to be a statute that would give
the actual power of selection to the leader or the
chairman -- I forget the title -- of the Democratic
Party. And I don't know about the constitutionality of
that or not. In other words, go ahead.
MR. ROSSMAN: Let me respond to the most
difficult part of your question first, which is the
constitutionality of the party leader selecting a
candidate we think is not troublesome at all. In fact,
there are many instances in New York and in other States
where the political leaders, through their structure, do
pick the candidates, for example in the case of vacancy
election, which this Court upheld as constitutional in
the Rodriquez case.
But the question that I think that you're
asking is, is there some denial of voter or delegate
education, and does that pose a constitutional problem?
We have here a bare statutory framework and the
statutory framework does not in any way, shape, or form
preclude the ability of delegates to become educated
about the candidates. Within that bare statutory
framework. The parties themselves, through what we
contend is core associational activity protected by the
First Amendment, participate in their own way of
choosing in educating delegates and in putting forth the
candidacies of judicial -- potential judicial nominees.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose that the
State can make the judgment that it's more likely that
the delegates would be informed about the qualifications
of candidates for judgeship than voters?
MR. ROSSMAN: In fact, we think that is the
very judgment that the State has made here. And when,
as Mr. Olson said, when it went from a primary to a
convention process, the idea behind it in part was that
the delegates could be more educated, would be expected
to be more educated than rank-and-file voters would be
about judges. And the evidence in this case is that
rank-and-file voters are not educated hardly at all
about the judge candidates that they select. So we
think this is clearly a legislative sensible policy
choice to put the selection process in the hands of
those who have the motivation and the opportunity to
become more educated about those that they're selecting.
Now, one thing that needs to be recalled in
this process is, of course, it is not merely a State-run
election. As -- as the Court observed in Jones, it is a
party affair, too. So there are core First Amendment
rights of the parties themselves that attach.
And the question -- I think in response to
Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there's
confusion between the party leaders and the parties, it
is our reading of the Eu, Tashjian and Jones cases that
the Court has recognized that parties have a structure
and have the core constitutional right to create their
own structure, and their leadership can make choices for
the parties. So they can choose to endorse candidates,
for example. They can choose to associate or not
associate with particular individuals. And that's a
choice that's made here by duly elected leaders of the
parties.
And if there's a problem with that, the
remedy for that problem is in the political arena. The
remedy is for the rank-and-file voters to vote their
party leaders out when they come up for election if they
adopt a process that they don't like or they think
squelches the input of the rank-and-file members.
So the reason that -- the reason why that's
not happening here, we believe, could be attributable to
one of two things. It could be attributable to apathy,
which the Constitution does not have a prerogative to
stamp out, or it could be attributable to party unity
and the fact that leaders are sensitive to who will be
best to advance the interests of their rank-and-file
members. But we don't think there's a constitutional
problem with that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the autonomy of
the party and, let's say, the leader is the
justification for this, the party -- how -- how
autonomous can a party be when it's told, even if you
want to be more democratic about how you choose your
candidates, you can't because New York is forcing this
system on you?
MR. ROSSMAN: Well, the only system that New
York is forcing is a bare framework for representative
democracy. It's a convention. It's no different than
--
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the parties are not
protesting in this case, are they?
MR. ROSSMAN: Absolutely not.
JUSTICE SCALIA: If and when that situation
arises, I suppose we can -- we can decide it. But it's
not here. The parties are totally happy with this and
would do it on their own.
MR. ROSSMAN: We absolutely agree. The
parties intervened from the outset of this case, both
major parties, because they share the view that the
system is better than a primary would be, and they
believe that their right --
JUSTICE SCALIA: In fact, it is probably
likely the parties got this system adopted by the New
York legislature.
MR. ROSSMAN: Well, however the legislative
process has unfolded, in 1921, multiple times since, and
to the present when the legislature filed an amicus
brief with the Second Circuit, the legislature has
clearly been in support of this. And we think it's
within -- it's a core State power, it's a sensible
legislative choice that they have made. It' ss within
the contours of American Party of Texas v. White, which
recognized, as Justice Scalia observed moments ago, that
the State can choose to have primaries or conventions.
Where the State has chosen to have
conventions, party rights attach to that. And the one
thing that the lower court did that we urge the Court to
consider to be quite inappropriate was to apply strict
scrutiny to what is routine core party associational
activity. Leaders developing candidacies, recommending
candidates, endorsing candidates, and fielding delegates
who they think are loyal to the interests of the party,
that doesn't deserve strict scrutiny. At worst, we
think there's no burden here to the rank-and-file voters
to force them to participate in the party's own
convention. But even if there were some burden, at
worst, we think that there are countervailing rights
here. And where there are countervailing rights the
Court should prefer to the legislative expertise here,
and the expertise -- thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Rossman.
Mr. Schwarz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK A.O. SCHWARZ, JR.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SCHWARZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
On a robust record, the district court,
confirmed in great detail by the Second Circuit, found
that there were severe burdens placed upon insurgents
and placed upon party members who wished to band
together to support a candidate.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the burden on a
single delegate wanting to be on the ballot? I think
that requires 500 votes, and there was no specific
finding that that was burden, was there? Or am
incorrect?
MR. SCHWARZ: Two --there was no specific
finding that was a burden, you're correct. I have two
additional points to make.
First, if you look at John Dunne's amicus
brief, John Dunne was a Republican leader in the State
of New York. He was chairman of the judiciary committee
for many years in the State Senate. And he on page 19
of his brief describes how it was impossible even for
him to get admitted as a delegate, and it wasn't
worthwhile to try and be a lone gadfly.
Secondly, the courts analyzed the burden in
terms of the difficulty of assembling and running a
slate of delegates, a slate that cut across the various
assembly districts, and the court found --
JUSTICE ALITO: Assuming that the plaintiffs
have associational rights at stake here, isn't this a
case where there's a conflict between two associational
-- two sets of rights of association? You have the
party hierarchy who wants to, in your own words, fence
out the insurgents. That's a right not to associate.
And then you have the insurgents who want to be fenced
MR. SCHWARZ: Well, the --
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that different from
the cases that you rely on?
MR. SCHWARZ: I -- I think not, Your Honor,
because I think if you think about the question of do
the party leaders have the right to stifle the voices of
ordinary members, one should conclude no, and it's very
different from your decision in Jones.
JUSTICE ALITO: But that's charged language:
They have the right to stifle.
MR. SCHWARZ: Okay.
JUSTICE ALITO: The insurgents, do they not
-- does not the right of association include the right
not to associate?
MR. SCHWARZ: I think, Your Honor, the right
of association does not include the right to use an
election system imposed by the State which makes it
impossible. That's where the burden comes from. It's
because the State has imposed this system on every
party. So I do not think there is a countervailing
right on the other side.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What are your -- what are
you best cases for that proposition?
MR. SCHWARZ: In the -- I would say in the
first place I'd have to start out by saying there's not
the case on all fours like this. The -- then I would
say that's quite clear why that would be, because
there's no system like this in the United States and
never has been.
The -- I guess I would say after that point,
that the cases -- first, there are principles in your
cases. There's a principle being worried about the
effect of State laws serving to entrench power. That's
a theme that runs through all your cases.
Secondly, there is in your cases the --
many, many cases that hold what's important is to make a
realistic assessment of how a statute actually works.
Now, having said those two points by way
of -- three points by way of preliminary, first, there's
nothing on all fours and really you wouldn't expect it,
then what are cases that I think are -- that bite in our
favor? Well, there are principles in the cases.
I would start with Storer and Storer says in
assessing severe burden what you want to look at is the
-- is the realistic effect of whether people have gotten
on the ballot. And Storer says if you find that happens
rarely, while it's not conclusive, it's the -- it's
indicative that there is a severe burden.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Storer --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that a general
election case?
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a general election
case, isn't it?
MR. SCHWARZ: Well, but the principles of
whether the election, general election cases and the
primary cases should apply, it seems to me are the same
principles. The root principles that apply are the same
ones.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me ask you
about that.
MR. SCHWARZ: Please.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's suppose the
State doesn't think that direct voter election of judges
is a good idea, that it thinks there ought to be some
insulation to avoid the problems of judges campaigning
and raising money and all that; yet, at the same time
they want some participation by the voters in the
process. Is there any way they can achieve that
objective, to have the nominees actually chosen not by
the voters but by a convention, and yet have some role
by the voters?
MR. SCHWARZ: There absolutely is, Your
Honor. We do not claim here that any convention is
inappropriate. Conventions are appropriate.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm just asking
is there a way to have a convention with some role by
the voters or the party --
MR. SCHWARZ: Yes, Your Honor, as long as
that convention does not set up severe barriers to
people competing; and I would say even if you look at
the Board of Elections' own --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't that
seem kind of odd, that if a State can have no role for
voters, it can have a pure convention, that they're
penalized if they have some role for voters?
MR. SCHWARZ: I wouldn't put it as being
penalized, Your Honor. I think it is the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Being found
unconstitutional is a pretty severe penalty.
(Laughter.)
MR. SCHWARZ: But it's what we seek and we
think the courts below appropriately granted, Your
Honor. The -- but it's not penalizing the State for
doing something; it's saying if do you this, and if you
severely burden, as after an extensive fact-finding
hearing the court held the statutes do, then you have to
show that there's a compelling justification.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Schwarz -- I'm sorry,
go ahead.
JUSTICE SOUTER: The, the problem that I
have in the analogy you are drawing on the application
of your principle based on the general election cases is
this: There is concededly -- and you mentioned this
earlier -- there is concededly no unreasonable barrier
to somebody who wants to become a delegate. He's got to
get 500 signature, but that can be done. The burden
that I understand that your clients are complaining
about is the, in effect, the burden of influencing the
ultimate decision-maker to decide to nominate that
person.
And that burden is -- is focused on two
points: number one, the entrenched power of the
political bosses; and number two, the difficulty --
well, I guess three points -- the difficulty of
fielding, for a dissident to field a whole slate of
candidates who in effect, once elected, would make the
nomination desired; or, three, the capacity of the
intending or the aspiring candidate to influence the
delegates directly once they're selected, because the
time is short.
And those aren't -- those aren't, it seems
to me, complaints about access to the electoral process.
They're complaints about the capacity to influence those
who are elected, who make the ultimate decision. And
that's the difficulty I have in the analogy that you are
drawing or the parallel that you are making between the
direct election cases and your claim here. Could you
comment on that?
MR. SCHWARZ: Yeah. I guess I want to make
two comments. First, it seems to me the principles that
are in your direct election cases, and also primary
cases like Kusper and the Panish v. Lubin or Lubin v.
Panish, where the Court took the language in your
Williams case about you ought to be worried if there are
multiple parties competing, clamoring for a place on the
ballot, and said, well, that should also apply -- this
Court said that should also apply in a primary context
where there are multiple people seeking to -- to attain
a nomination.
Now, should it matter because here the
primary or the election -- it's really an election but
the State happens to call it a primary -- should it
matter that that is in the preliminary stage, in the
nomination stage?
I would suggest it should not.
Now, I think your --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's still the case
that at the end of the day, the nub of your claim is
that the intending judicial candidate cannot effectively
politic, does not have a reasonable chance of getting
selected; and I don't see that as a -- as a direct
ballot access claim.
Let me put the question in another way:
Your -- your friend on the other side, Mr. Rossman, in
response to a question, said that if this election of
the judicial candidate for the party were made directly
by the political bosses, whatever their titles are, the
ones who are supposedly in control here, he would not
see any constitutional objection to that.
What if New York had a system that provided
precisely for that? The political bosses, as I
understand it, get elected every 2 years and the State
law would provide that those party bosses, whatever
their title is, would in fact select the candidate.
Would that be unconstitutional?
MR. SCHWARZ: I think I would like to draw a
distinction between the law as I think you've described
it and a different law that Justice Scalia described. I
think the law that Justice Scalia described would be
constitutional. If what the State did is to say, you
the party decide on what to do, I think the State is
then not putting a thumb on the scale; the State is not
interfering with the disputes within the party.
However, on the statute that I think you
described, Justice Souter, where the State says, we
decree that for every party the leader shall make the
decision, I think that would be unconstitutional because
the State has no business intervening in the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But the party isn't
objecting.
MR. SCHWARZ: Well, Your Honor, I think
that's --
JUSTICE SOUTER: The party -- the party
likes it.
MR. SCHWARZ: I'm sure the party likes it.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And you are the -- the
claim here: These people are not, as I understand it,
bringing a case on behalf of rights of the party.
They're bringing a case based on a premise of a
principle of participation, which is theirs.
And that's why, it seems to me, that the
hypo that I posed is not significantly different,
provided the parties aren't objecting, in which we have
a different case.
But it seems to me that my hypo is not
significantly different from the one that gave rise to
the question that Mr. Rossman answered.
MR. SCHWARZ: Well, the -- first, on the
consent of the party leaders, which is really what we
have here, of course they are -- they like the system
because the State system entrenches them.
And -- and this Court --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the Federal system in
practice entrenches United States Senators.
I'm -- I'm not sure that, in terms of
political participation on the part of an intending or
an aspiring judge that the system that I suggested in
the hypo, in which the party bosses select the nominee,
is for constitutional purposes significantly different
from the Federal system for -- for picking district
judges.
MR. SCHWARZ: Well, because the Federal
system provides that there shall not be elections. Here
elections --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. And in my hypo the
only election is the election for the party boss.
MR. SCHWARZ: Well, I would still suggest,
Your Honor, that, as we see the case that would be
unconstitutional. But our case is much stronger than
that because, in any event, there is here an election
for delegates.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But isn't your
argument still that, because there is a limitation on
the participation of the intending judicial candidate,
there is ultimately a constitutional problem?
So let me pose a different question to you,
and this one is not hypothetical. The nub of your case
is that the political bosses in effect are controlling
the process because they tell the delegates who to vote
for. Does your -- does the intending judicial nominee
whom you represent have any difficulty in getting to the
political bosses and saying: I want you to consider me?
MR. SCHWARZ: Yes. They would not listen to
her, and they said: We won't listen to you in this
particular case; we won't listen to you because you
declined to hire an unqualified person as your law
clerk.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. They -- for
political reasons, they're saying: We don't like you.
There are -- there are a lot of people who go to United
States Senators, and the United States Senators say:
Scram; we don't -- we don't like you; your politics
aren't good enough for us.
And so I'm not saying that -- that -- on my
hypo the person who lobbies the bosses directly is --is
claiming a right to success. I think they're claiming a
right to have a chance to influence the process. And
why don't they have the chance by going to the boss?
MR. SCHWARZ: Well, Your Honor, let me try
two things. First, that never has worked. And it -- it
has to be -- at least using the Storer analysis of what
actually happens, the fact that never in the history of
New York, not in the Republican Party, not in the
Democratic Party, not in New York City, not in upstate,
never has someone who was opposed by the party boss been
able to become a judge.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And I don't know of
any enemy of a United States -- go ahead.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The person wouldn't be
opposed if he approached the boss and the boss said:
Yeah. Boy, I really like you. That person would
automatically not be a rebel. He'd be part of the
establishment.
(Laughter.)
MR. SCHWARZ: But the -- you know, this
isn't an issue that divides by ideology. It's --
really, the question here is if you have a statute that
makes it difficult for the voters to participate, to
have a voice. That's really the question. And if I
could use something that the Board of Elections' brief
conceded in both their reply and their opening brief,
they said a person -- they said that party members who
wanted to attempt to assemble a slate to try to
influence the decision at the convention would be "well
served" -- that's their exact words -- to assemble and
run a slate. But the district court and the circuit
court found that it was impossible -- severely
burdensome, actually impossible -- for that burden to be
met.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this
question, Mr. Schwarz. Supposing that the statute did
not contain the delegate-selection process and instead,
said: Delegates shall be selected by the county
chairman in each county and by the organization. Would
it then be unconstitutional?
MR. SCHWARZ: If it said delegates will be
selected --
JUSTICE STEVENS: By party officials.
MR. SCHWARZ: I'm not sure about that. I'm
not -- I think that -- I'm not sure. I think it's
different than Justice Souter's hypothetical.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just saying just
eliminate this whole folderol about picking delegates
and say the county chairman shall pick the delegates,
period. I don't see why that would be unconstitutional.
MR. SCHWARZ: I'm not sure I have a position
on that one way or the other. What I do say, though, is
this Court in your Minnesota Republican Party v. White
decision said it makes -- and, you know, the question of
whether judges should be elected or appointed is a
controversial question. But this Court in that decision
said that if you're going to have an election -- and
here we have elections for delegates -- if you're going
to have an election, you shouldn't structure that
election in a way that makes it in that case extremely
difficult or impossible or forbidden --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Schwarz, you're
talking about the election of the judge or the election
of the delegate? I think you're mixing two oranges and
apples there.
MR. SCHWARZ: Well, the -- I do believe that
the election of the delegates raises the constitutional
questions about has the State put its thumb on the
scale, has the State done something that severely
burdens the voters.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It -- the evidence shows
the thumb on the scale is just as strong as if the party
chairman picked the delegates. And, therefore, it seems
to me, it presents the question of whether it would be
unconstitutional to enact a statute that allows the
party chairman to pick the delegates.
MR. SCHWARZ: I'm not sure, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you're not sure,
it's difficult --
JuSTICE KENNEDY: If I could interrupt,
Justice Breyer, for just a moment. But in the Minnesota
case the thumb on the scale was to deprive the
constituents of a First Amendment right. Smith v.
Allwright, it was a right not to be discriminated
against race. Here what we're asking is: What is the
substantive right?
MR. SCHWARZ: Well, I think here it is the
right not to be burdened, severely burdened, in an
election. And that just runs through all your cases --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but what you are
calling -- and correct me if I am wrong. Maybe I
misunderstand this. I think what you are calling the
severe burden is the difficulty of assembling a whole
slate that can control the meeting or have a majority in
the ultimate meeting of that delegate, of those
delegates, and therefore actually select the candidate
who wants to put the slate together. And it's control
over result rather than the capacity of any individual
to get elected a delegate which I think you are
objecting to. Am I wrong?
MR. SCHWARZ: We have never said that
there's a right to win. We have only said there's a
right to meaningfully participate.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but when you say
"meaningfully participate" you talk about putting -- and
candidly talk about putting -- a slate of delegates
together.
If I put a slate of delegates together, it
is because once those delegates are selected they're
going to support me; and that's why it -- I think your
real argument is not that somebody has difficulty
becoming a candidate for a delegate or even getting
elected one. The difficulty that you're claiming is
that it's hard for the intending judicial candidate to
assemble a large enough group of people to give that
candidate success once the delegates are elected. It's
a success argument that you are making, not an access
argument.
MR. SCHWARZ: No. It's a compete argument,
not an access argument. And I do think the Constitution
should be read to say that if the State passes laws that
make it very hard for voters to band together or for
insurgent candidates to compete, then -- and it is a
severe burden, they have to justify it. And, by the
way, they haven't sought in their papers to justify it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could a State decide it
doesn't want candidates to have any part in this
delegate-selection process? It thinks it's unseemly to
have would-be judges engage in that kind of activity.
So it structures the system that says that they choose
delegates for a convention, but we don't want those
delegates to be the delegates of any particular
candidate. We want to insulate this process from
would-be candidate influence. Would that be
unconstitutional?
MR. SCHWARZ: The problem is that in the
real world the statutes work to entrench the power of
the party leaders and to prevent voters from, to use the
Board of Elections' reply brief, I think, on page 5, to
use -- or 17, to use -- the voters are not able to band
together to try and influence the results at the
conventions.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course not. You're
really arguing against the whole purpose this scheme,
which is not to have judges popularly elected. And
you're saying no, we want them popularly elected. The
purpose of the scheme is to -- is to have the people
elect delegates and have delegates use their good
judgments as to who -- as to who the best judge would
be. But you say, no, we want the people to have an
input. I mean, it's contrary to the whole purpose of
the scheme. Of course it works the way you say it does.
It is designed to work that way. It's a basic judgment
not to have judges popularly elected, and your objection
amounts to saying no, judges ought to be popularly
elected.
MR. SCHWARZ: We -- we have no problem with
the convention, but we don't think that the -- either
the insurgent candidate or the band of voters who wish
to support that person should be, by the State, fenced
out, severely burdened from attempting to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's all right,
I take it, if they don't prevail? For example --
MR. SCHWARZ: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the other side
says that your argument is -- is implicated whenever a
convention leads to a different nominee than the
primary.
MR. SCHWARZ: No, that's -- that's not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think
there's anything wrong with the convention deciding that
the nominee is going to be someone other than the person
who would prevail in the primary election.
MR. SCHWARZ: There is nothing wrong with
that, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's all right to
fence them out to that extent?
MR. SCHWARZ: If you want -- if we want to
call that fencing. I don't call that fencing. That's
the -- if the convention is one that is put together
without the State burdening the ability for people to
get involved --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it, in
evaluating the burden, we should look at how difficult
it is for someone to be elected a delegate.
MR. SCHWARZ: I think you should also look
at the -- since the party leaders run slates and they
have no difficulty in running slates because -- for
various reasons that the courts found, I think you
should look at the question of slates as well as
individual delegates. And in considering individual
delegates, I do think that Mr. Dunne's amicus brief
which describes, on his page 19, indicates that, you
know, it's -- it's a little unrealistic to think that
anybody other than --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is that
because Mr. Dunne was not supported by the party members
at the convention --
MR. SCHWARZ: No, he wasn't --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- for whatever
higher office --
MR. SCHWARZ: He wasn't trying to be a
judge, Your Honor. He -- he speaks about his desire to
be a delegate and his being told that, you're not
sufficiently reliable; we're not going to let you be a
delegate.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What did he have to
do to become on the ballot for delegate?
MR. SCHWARZ: If he wanted to be a single
person running -- appearing as a gadfly --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 500 signatures,
right?
MR. SCHWARZ: He needs the 500 signatures.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we don't think
that's a sufficient burden, do you lose?
MR. SCHWARZ: I think we have a difficult
case, if you don't think that's sufficient burden. If
you think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the State -- the trial
court didn't find that that was a burden.
MR. SCHWARZ: No, I -- I'm not -- I'm
agreeing with the Chief Justice that I think that, if
you thought that just running for one delegate slot was
sufficient to solve the problem of a State statute that
was designed -- their words, their admission -- to
entrench the power of the party leaders, I think that
gives us a problem.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why? I mean I don't see
how you avoid answering Justice Stevens's hypothetical?
The reason I think you have to answer it is because the
New York system is the system he described in the
hypothetical, with a safety valve.
MR. SCHWARZ: The safety valve being?
JUSTICE BREYER: The safety valve being that
the party leaders cannot just choose anybody. I mean,
if it looks they're going to choose something really
nutty, then there will be opposition to these delegates
and something will happen.
MR. SCHWARZ: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: So they have leeway, but
you can't go too far.
MR. SCHWARZ: The record, Your Honor, and
this is an extensive record, shows that the party
leaders can choose and do choose people who are, to use
your word, who are --
JUSTICE BREYER: You don't like that.
That's why I say you have to answer it. If you feel
that that's so terrible, then you say no, the
Constitution forbids that, though you'd have to explain,
wouldn't you, why, with all its faults, that is not
better in the judgment of New York than a system where
people raise $4 million from the lawyers in order to run
for office?
MR. SCHWARZ: We -- no, we -- we have not
said that there needs to be a primary. We haven't said
that. And sometimes our opponents leave the impression
that we have said that. We haven't said that.
You know, there are -- get rid of the
leaders --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the -- that's the
remedy that, the temporary remedy, that you sought was
-- at the bottom line, the court's order was, until New
York reacts to this decision, the candidates will be
chosen by primary.
MR. SCHWARZ: Yes, the -- but the judge,
Your Honor -- the judge did two things in imposing that
remedy, three or four things actually:
He said, first, I'm not going to
micromanage. I think the statutes are unconstitutional.
I'm not going to get into all the details of fixing it
because the Legislature should do that and the Federal
courts shouldn't do that.
Second, he relied on the fact that the
fall-back position in the State statutes is there is a
primary if there is no other system in place.
But, third and most important, he stayed his
decision to give the Legislature time to address the
question, and they were well on their way to addressing
it when this Court gave us the opportunity to be here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree it's
not realistic that one way they would address it is by
having an entirely appointed system?
MR. SCHWARZ: No, they -- they're entitled
to do that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know they are
entitled to it.
MR. SCHWARZ: Well, the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As a practical
matter, is that a realistic option in New York?
MR. SCHWARZ: If you look at the amicus
briefs filed in our favor, the State bar, the City bar,
the Fund for the Modern Courts, the City of New York all
filed a brief in which they say, we think the right
solution is to have an appointive system, and they're
working to try to have that happen. And the governor
has put forward a bill for an appointive system. But,
they say --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sure he
has. I mean that's in his interest.
(Laughter.)
MR. SCHWARZ: No, not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought I read a
representation somewhere in the briefs that it's
unrealistic to expect that New York would move to an
entirely appointive system. So that the options, if
you're successful, the options will either be direct
election of judges or a pure convention with no role for
the voters at all.
MR. SCHWARZ: No, it could be a role for the
voters that does not burden them in the way this statute
burdens them.
And the -- that brief by the State bar and
the Bar of the Association of the City of New York and
the other groups who are strongly in favor of an
appointive system, say to this Court, this is the worst
of all worlds. And it -- this system, as also the
amicus brief from the former judges who were responsible
for appellate judges responsible for administering the
New York State system, says that this system has
undermined judicial independence and undermined
confidence in the courts.
And that is -- you know -- that is clearly
correct --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's also one view, I
think it was, in the Feerick Report that said, the worst
thing in the world would be to return us to the primary
system this system was intended to replace.
MR. SCHWARZ: Yes, the -- actually the
Feerick report, which found that the party leaders all
over State however have always made the picks, they
voiced a favoring amending the law. They -- they think
the law needs to be amended.
And Chief Judge Kaye, in her remarks after
the decisions came down and after the Feerick Commission
report came out, said the problems that had been
revealed in this case are pervasive both systemically
and geographically.
The Feerick Commission's view is that,
unless there's public financing, in which case they'd
favor some more involvement by the voters, is simply
amend the portions of the law that make it so burdensome
on competitors, on voters.
We're -- we're neutral. We just say this
law is unconstitutional. And how it should be amended
is up to the Legislature, but that it should be amended
is -- there's a powerful case and, you know, I don't
know where I am on the time here, but I commend to you
the various amicus briefs that have come in on --
JUSTICE STEVENS: They're all policy
arguments about why this is a terrible statute. They're
not necessarily constitutional arguments.
MR. SCHWARZ: No, they also speak --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And that's a vast
difference.
MR. SCHWARZ: -- speak about the
Constitution, and, indeed, it's not very often that you
find, on a constitutional issue, both the Washington
Legal Foundation and the ACLU coming in, as they have
come in, to assert that this is an unconstitutional
statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's not often
you have both the Democratic Party and the Republican
Party --
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- supporting it
either.
MR. SCHWARZ: Yes, but then I -- I think you
should look at the -- what you've said in -- not you,
but your predecessor said in Eu, about we've never held
that a political party's consent will cure a statute
that otherwise is violative and, there are other quotes
in Justice Scalia's Tashjian opinion and in -- in
several other cases to that effect.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Schwarz.
MR. SCHWARZ: Thank you.
Mr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK STATE
BOARD OF ELECTIONS ET AL.
MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
The Second Circuit reinstalled what the New
York Legislature found to be a bad system, that it
discouraged qualified candidates and it encouraged this
unfortunate, unseemly race for money.
The Respondents just said that that is not
what they were interested in doing, but their prayer for
their relief, on page 35 of their complaint, calls for a
direct primary election for the Supreme Court.
With respect to the Kusper case,
Justice Kennedy, I gave that a little bit more thought.
That -- that case focused on the fact that the statute
was inhibiting the rights of an individual who wanted to
participate in a way that the party wanted that
individual to participate. That long period of time
prevented both the individual and the association from
associating together, which is why --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You say the State, your
mean the State statute?
MR. OLSON: Yes. But -- and to the extent
that it was -- it was -- part of that is answered by
your Clingman case which just came relatively recently,
where the party wanted independents to vote in the
primary and the Supreme Court -- this Court said that
the State had to let that happen. With respect to time
periods between when you had to identify yourself as a
party member this court held in the Rosario case that a
certain length of time is appropriate under the system.
With respect to Mr. Dunne, we've heard about
him. He may have had a desire to be a delegate but he
never tried to get the 500 signatures. It says that
right on his -- on page 19 of his brief -- the brief
that my colleague was quoting.
With respect to the questions that I think
both Justice Stevens and Justice Souter were asking,
could the State lodge the candidate selection or the
delegate selection process in the party leaders, I can't
conceive of how that would be unconstitutional.
If the parties wanted to select the
delegates or select the candidates to be their standard
bearers, that seems to me to be perfectly within the
right of an association to do; and would be perfectly
appropriate, provided that there was an access for
independents and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not saying the State
could compel that?
MR. OLSON: No. No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that the
State could permit it?
MR. OLSON: No. But I think those
hypothetical questions are could the State vest that
authority.
Finally I think it's important to say -- oh,
one more preliminary point. It is competitive in New
York. It may not be perfectly competitive, as is the
case of 90 percent of the congressional districts in
this country, which are said not to be competitive. But
in New York, six sitting judges testified in -- in -- in
the lower court that they successfully lobbied delegates
to, you know, to be candidates. So that happens.
Between 1900 and 2002, this is appendix 130,
nearly one fourth of the general elections in New York
were competitive.
Lopez Torres, the Respondent, received 25
votes at the 2002 judicial selection convention, and
many of the districts in New York are not dominated by a
single party.
So the final point is it is important to
emphasize this is a -- a challenge on its face to the
statute that simply creates a delegate election and it
then creates a convention. Neither of those provisions
can possibly be constitutional, and so what the
Respondents are complaining about is what party bosses
But on page 38 of their brief, they state
categorically that the constitutional offense is not the
fact that party leaders act as one would expect in
choosing nominees.
In other words, they act -- party leaders act like party
leaders and exercise their influence. They're not
saying that that's unconstitutional. What they're
saying is that a statute that allows party leaders to be
party leaders, to be constitutional, to act in ways
which are not only permissible under the Constitution as
they knowledge, but constitutionally protected, is
somehow constitutional. That simply is not consistent
with any of this Court's jurisprudence, which says that
political parties must have the maximum opportunity to
select their leadership.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Olson.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the
