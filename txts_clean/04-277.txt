CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
next, number 04-277, National Cable & Telecommunications
Association v. Brand X Internet Services.
Mr. Hungar.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 04-281
MR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress
declared that it is the policy of the United States to
preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that
presently exists for the Internet unfettered by federal or
state regulation. The FCC implemented that clear policy
directive in the order under review by concluding that
cable modem service should be classified as an information
service and not a telecommunications service under the
Communications Act. That reasonable determination should
be upheld, because it is consistent with the text,
history, and purposes of the Act.
The Act defines "telecommunications" as the
transmission of information without change in form or
substance, and "telecommunications service" as the
offering of telecommunications directly to the public for
a fee.
Given that focus on the nature of the "offering
to the public," the FCC reasonably concluded that the
integrated cable modem service offering should be viewed
as a whole in determining its classification under the
Act.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why is that reasonable?
I mean, why is it offered to the public if it's offered
alone, but it's not offered to the public if it's offered
with a tie-in? I mean, if -- you know, if I say, you
know, I'm selling you a windshield alone, I guess I'm
offering a windshield. But if I say, you know, you've got
to buy the windshield with a car, am I any less selling
you a windshield?
MR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't think we would say,
in that example, that you are offering windshields, per
se. I mean, to give an example, carmax.com offers cars
for sale over the Internet, but I don't think we would
ordinarily say that they are offering windshields or
steering wheels or tires for sale. Certainly, that's not
been necessary construction of a regulatory regime that,
say, is designed to focus on sellers of tires. It
wouldn't automatically, as a matter of law, have to be
applied to entities that are selling cars instead. And
the same is true here.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, suppose I just tie it in
with windshield wipers.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, again, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You can only buy my windshield
if you buy the windshield wipers with it. Am I no longer
selling a windshield because I'm selling it with -- only
with windshield wipers?
MR. HUNGAR: Well, I think it would depend on
the nature of the regulatory --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Fifty-fifty.
MR. HUNGAR: -- regime.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But don't you think that the
telecommunications aspect of what's going on here is at
least as important as the information aspect of it? The
information is useless unless it can be conveyed.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, the -- and, by the same
token, the transmission component is useless unless it
offers all of the -- all of the information-services type
functionality that Internet service offers.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not necessarily. You could --
you can use that broadband service to go to other
information providers.
MR. HUNGAR: But, Your Honor, it's the -- it's
the capabilities that you purchase in the integrated
package -- not the pure transmission, but the other
capabilities, the computer data-processing, data-access
capabilities that are an essential part of that. If all
you had was the transmission, with none of the other
computer functionality -- if you typed in the Supreme
Court's Website, for instance, supremecourtus.gov, nothing
would happen, because all of the computer functionality,
like the domain-name system, which is a very
sophisticated, complex, distributed database involving
literally millions of computers around the world, that's
data processing. That's information-services capability
that you use every time you type in a Website.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that.
MR. HUNGAR: It's not just transmission. It's
much more than that. And without the -- without the
computer data-processing aspects, it doesn't do anything.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree, but the question isn't
whether it doesn't do anything; the question is whether
you are still offering telecommunications services to the
public. And it seems to me -- look it, I offer you
broadband, initially without any information function at
the end of it, and you're using this broadband to do all
sorts of good stuff, going where you want, getting what
you want, conveying what you want. And then I change my
rules and I say, "You know, in the future the only way I'm
offering this broadband is if you, in addition to buying
the broadband communications capacity, buy my information
technology at the end of it." Have I suddenly stopped
selling the broadband -- or offering the broadband to the
public? I just don't think that's a reasonable --
MR. HUNGAR: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- use of language.
MR. HUNGAR: -- well, two points. Your question
starts with, I think, an incorrect assumption about the
nature of the world. The pure transmission function has
not been offered to the public, to consumers, separately
and apart -- again, it doesn't do anything. Consumers
don't use the pure transmission functions by itself.
"Internet service," by definition, includes the data-
processing aspects that the Commission so found on this
record, and that factual determine is reasonable and
supported by the record.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I was giving you a
hypothetical. I --
MR. HUNGAR: Well, in the -- in the
hypothetical, it's conceivable that a different result
might be reached by the regulatory agency with authority
for construing the statute and applying it to particular
fact situations. But I don't think the word "offering"
necessarily and always compels the conclusion that any
component of an integrated offering is also separately
being offered within the meaning of the statute. It
depends on the purposes of the statute, as construed by
the regulatory agency. "Offering" is ambiguous. And,
therefore, what the agency has done here is reasonable.
And it's supported, I would add, by the
consistent pre-1996 regulatory approach in this area,
which all parties agreed Congress incorporated into the
1996 Act.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But if you do the same
combination over telephone lines, you say they are -- they
are selling --
MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- offering to the public
communications service.
MR. HUNGAR: That's because the telephone
companies have always offered a standalone transmission
component which other -- which other ISPs can utilize.
They've done that because of the preexisting regulatory
regime. They've always made the separate offering;
therefore, it is a telecommunications service.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What bearing does history have
upon the definitional question of whether, when you sell a
bundled offering of information technology and
communications, you are selling communications?
MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: With respect to the telephone
long-lines, you say, yes, you are; and with respect to
cable, you say, no, you aren't.
MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, it's certainly not
unusual for this Court, in construing a statute, to look
to the regulatory history that led up to the enactment of
the statute, particularly where it's clear in the
legislative history that Congress was in -- was
essentially borrowing from the pre-1996 regulatory
definitions, the definitional scheme that the Commission
adopted in 1980 in its Computer II report. All parties
agree that that definitional framework forms the
foundation for the very definitions at issue here. That's
undisputed.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Hungar, what is the
tentative decision the FCC has taken on the DSL
regulation?
MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the FCC has tentatively
concluded that when a telephone company makes an
integrated offering of the DSL transmission capacity with
the Internet service, as a combined offering to consumers,
that, tentatively that is an information service,
precisely the classification that you --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Even though --
MR. HUNGAR: -- read here.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- telephone lines have
always been subject to common-carrier regulation.
MR. HUNGAR: That's correct. And even though --
when a telephone company is making a separate standalone
offering of just the pure DSL transmission capacity, which
is useful only to ISPs, to Internet Service Providers, not
to consumers, that that would be viewed, has traditionally
been viewed, as a common-carriage offering, because it's
pure transmission. But when it's a bundled -- or when
it's an integrated offering -- again, this goes back to
1980. This very issue, Justice Scalia, was addressed by
the Commission in 1980, and it said, if the offering is
limited to pure transmission, it is basic
telecommunications, basic service, the precursor to
telecommunications service; but if you add any computer
functionality to the offering, then it is not basic, it is
enhanced service. They said that at paragraphs 93 to 97
of the ---
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand what --
MR. HUNGAR: -- Computer II order.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- they're saying, but they're
doing it all on policy grounds. This definition means
this, because that produces a good result. With respect
to telephone lines, they say, yes, bundled is, or it
isn't, depending upon whether we like the result it
produces.
MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It just doesn't seem to --
MR. HUNGAR: It depends on the nature of the
offering. If the entity is offering -- if cable
companies, tomorrow, start offering pure cable
transmission on an -- on a nondiscriminate basis, that
would regulated as a telecommunications service. But what
the Commission has always said is that you look at the
offering as a whole, and if it's a -- an integrated
offering that encompasses not just telecommunications, but
data-processing, and computer-type services, as well, it's
in the enhanced or information-service category that --
the Commission said, in 1980, "We're doing this, in part,
because it's not clear -- it's clear that Congress didn't
intend, in the 1934 Act, to extend regulation to this new
-- this novel, new type of intermingled service, and it
would be inappropriate, we think, to try and extend the
Act to that, for a number of reasons, including that it's
very hard to draw lines between which is -- which has more
of a communications versus data-processing component.
They had tried that, and concluded that it was
unworkable." And so, they drew the line. Basic
transmission, pure transmission, if the offering is
limited to that, it is on the telecommunications service,
or basic-service line; if it contains the computer-
processing capabilities, data acquisition and retrieval
and the like --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it seems to be saying,
because the cable companies do not offer separate
telecommunications service, they don't have to offer it.
MR. HUNGAR: Correct.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, it just -- it's
almost question-begging. It's peculiar.
MR. HUNGAR: I don't think so, Your Honor. It's
only -- it only -- it's only question-begging because the
Respondents have attempted to mischaracterize or
misdescribe what is going on here. The rule is, if you
are a common carrier, as the telephone companies are, and,
in 1980, the FCC was regulating in an environment when
there was only one avenue into the home, one
communications avenue, the telephone line, and they said,
"Under these circumstances, telephone common carriers are
not going to be allowed to escape Title II regulation
completely by offering enhanced services, if they can
offer an enhanced service, an intermingled -- integrated
transmission and computer data-processing service, and
that service, as a whole, when it's offered, will be
unregulated, because Title II does not extend to those
types of integrated service offerings." They said,
"However, if you -- if it is a telephone common carrier
that's making that offering, a facilities-based,
typically-monopoly common carrier, they will have an
obligation to also make a standalone offering of
transmission under Title II, because they were telephone
-- traditional common carriers."
Cable companies are not in that category. They
have not traditionally been --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say -- you say that
the FCC is changing its view. It has tentatively changed
its view. So it will bracket the telephone companies with
the cable companies.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, actually, that's an important
point, Justice Ginsburg. The FCC has never said that an
integrated offering of DSL that -- DSL Internet service,
the combined integrated offering, the analog to what we
have here, in the cable context -- the FCC has never said
that that is not an information service. They have -- and
they have tentatively concluded now that it is. What they
have said -- what they said in the 1998 order that
Respondents cite was that the telecommunications -- the
telephone companies are already offering DSL on a
standalone, pure-transmission basis to other competing
Internet Service Providers; therefore, it is a
telecommunications service. Indeed, it was undisputed
that it was a telecommunications service. And, again, the
reason they were doing that, we assume, is because the
preexisting Computer II and Computer III framework
required the telephone carriers to make that standalone
offering. But the Commission has not said the integrated
offering is also a telecommunications service, and it has
now tentatively concluded that it is an information
service, in keeping with 25 years of regulatory history
that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be left in the
common-carrier category?
MR. HUNGAR: Well, any standalone, pure-
transmission offering, including, under the Computer II
rationale, to the extent the Commission adheres to it --
and it hasn't overturned it yet; it's considering the
extent to which it should create an exception in the DSL
context -- but under Computer II, a basic, traditional
common carrier cannot get away -- cannot get out of Title
II regulation by offering an integrated offering. They
will also have to make the standalone offering, unless and
to the extent the Commission determines that that's not
necessary; for instance, because the enhanced or
integrated -- information-service market is sufficiently
competitive that it's not necessary and there are adequate
alternative --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's wonderful policy
--
MR. HUNGAR: -- communications pipelines.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's wonderful policy, but
I don't -- what I'm still waiting to hear is how you get
that out of the definitions, which is the lever that the
Commission is using to implement this good policy. It is
saying, in some cases, that a bundled offering is an
offering of telecommunications; and, in other cases, it's
saying a bundled offering isn't. And the reason, you say,
is not because of the nature of the thing, because of the
definition, it's because you tell us it has good
consequences in one case, and doesn't have good
consequences in the other.
MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I'm sorry, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not my understanding --
MR. HUNGAR: -- that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- of how definitions work.
MR. HUNGAR: Let me try to clarify what the
Commission's position is. The Commission has never said,
that I am aware of or that Respondents have pointed out,
that the integrated -- bundled, if you will -- the
integrated offering of transmission plus Internet service
functionality is a telecommunications service. They have
never said that. They have said that some companies,
telephone common carriers, will be required to make the
separate offering, but it is not correct that the
integrated offering is, itself, going to be classified as
a telecommunications service.  It's classified --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's --
MR. HUNGAR: -- as information.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in effect, it's the
unbundling requirement which is your answer to Justice
Scalia's -- Why should that make a difference? I mean,
you could just as well make an unbundling requirement with
respect to cable.
MR. HUNGAR: You could. And, in fact, the
Commission is -- has issued a notice of proposed
rulemaking and an invitation for comment in the order
under review here to consider whether it should make such
a requirement under its ancillary Title I authority in
this context, and what -- and, if so, to what extent?
JUSTICE SOUTER: And the reason for a
distinction, at least at the present time -- the reason
for the reasonableness of the distinction at the present
time, as a source of applying this definition, is history,
basically.
MR. HUNGAR: History and, not unrelated to that,
the fact that the cable companies have not traditionally
been regulated as common carriers under the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.
MR. HUNGAR: -- Title II of the Act. Yes,
that's correct.
And then just one final point, if I may --
Justice Scalia, I think this also goes to your question --
Respondents are the ones who are being inconsistent, and
that -- the states, for instance, they suggest that,
"Well, if" -- they say that, "Well, cable modem service
should be regulated as a telecommunications service, in
part." But, of course, traditional information service
providers, ISPs, should not be; they're pure information
service, even though ISPs also provide transmission. They
provide telecommunications. Information service -- excuse
me -- Internet service does not work unless you have
transmission from wherever the telephone call goes into
the central office, and it has to be transmitted from
there to the Internet Service Provider's point of presence
on the Internet, and from there out onto the Internet.
And Internet Service Providers either own or lease that
transmission capacity and offer that as part of the
bundled offering that they make.
So every Internet Service Provider would be a
telecommunications carrier under their position, and that
is contrary to what the FCC said before the '96 Act, and
it's contrary to what Congress said in the 1996 Act. They
said --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They claim that that's by
toleration of the FCC. I was going to ask them about
that, don't worry.
[Laughter.]
MR. HUNGAR: If I may reserve the balance of my
time.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Hungar.
Mr. Cappuccio, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL T. CAPPUCCIO
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-277
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Let me begin by trying to answer Justice
Scalia's question. The question here, Justice, is, Are we
offering two products, or are we offering two ingredients
that come together to form a separate product? And I
would submit that if you go back and read paragraph 120 of
the Computer II order, 1980, that's exactly what Congress
said was happening. What Congress said is, when you take
-- not Congress, I'm sorry; the FCC, of course -- when you
take the communications component and the data-processing
component and combine them, they are ingredients into what
is a new offering, and a new and unregulated offering.
They said, "We can't separate them. It's not useful to
try to separate them. And we view them as two
ingredients, forming a product that is a distinct
product."
JUSTICE BREYER: What is the -- what is the
data-processing part?
MR. CAPPUCCIO: In the case of cable modem
service, Your Honor, it's a number of things. It's the
ability to, for example, retrieve information from a
server that somebody has on the Web --
JUSTICE BREYER: So I guess, on that one, if, in
fact, you had a telephone system, and, at the other end of
the wire, Joe Smith, your friend, had recorded a message,
and when you rang the call, the service simply picked up
the message and played it to you, wouldn't it still be a
telephone system?
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Well, I think in your situation
-- in the hypothetical you give, Your Honor, that would be
somebody using just a regular transmission-only path to
hear what the other person --
JUSTICE BREYER: And how is this different?
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Well, because here, in the
example that I used, for example -- it's certainly not the
only one -- it is the capacity to retrieve information
that is stored otherwise. And that follows, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: Information that other people
have stored otherwise?
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Yes. And not -- and not
necessarily --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why isn't that even more
telecommunications than my answering service?
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: You know, I pick up my
messages.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: -- I would say, Your Honor, for
one thing, it fits squarely within the definition of
information service, which says --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, yes, of course it does,
and so does my answering service.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: I got -- what about the next
one? You were going to -- what I want to do is write down
a list --
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- of those things that are not
telecommunications.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: It's the ability to engage in --
to use your e-mail, it's the ability --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the ability to engage or
use my e-mail is an ability to access messages that other
people, who don't work for you, have left for me. Now,
again, I keep thinking of my answering machine --
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and it doesn't seem very
different.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: But, anyway, what's the third
one?
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Well, it's anything that allows
you to browse the World Wide Web and to -- and to retrieve
information from the World Wide Web.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, indeed.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: What it is, is a system where I
pick up the phone, and what my phone does is -- let's say
it had the ability to survey a number of possible people
who wanted to talk to me. Would that suddenly change it
from a phone to a computer or an information system?
MR. CAPPUCCIO: The --
JUSTICE BREYER: Because the other people are
leaving the information; it's not the phone that's doing
it.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Your Honor, the ability to
retrieve information that is stored somewhere out on a
server is not the raw transmission functionality. It is
more than that. It is what the Congress has said it is,
it is the ability to retrieve information. It is not
simply sending bits over a line and having those bits not
changed and not interfered with. When you retrieve
something from a server, you have to take it in form it is
on the server, you have to then put it through the
transmission system, and you have to reconvert it back
into what you want to see. It's an interactive process
that is more than just sending information.
JUSTICE BREYER: Rather like when I phone
Europe, and they take the message and turn it into
electronic packets, and they send it all over the world
and on computers and so forth, and it comes back to me
eventually, sounds a lot like my brother-in-law.
[Laughter.]
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Yeah, I guess -- look, Your
Honor, I am not disputing that an information service has
a component of it that's communications. It may, indeed,
have a component of it that's communication. But what the
FCC said in Computer II is that when you combine the --
you combine the communications with, for example, the
data-retrieval function, that that combination of things
is no longer the two separate products, it is a new
enhanced service that is beyond Title II.
And, Justice Scalia, part of the evidence that
these are not two separate products is, if they were, then
Congress never could have said if enhanced services were
outside of Title II. Computer II would have to be wrong
and overruled, even though it's now 20 --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The FCC --
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Yeah, I'm sorry, I keep saying
Congress; I meant the FCC.
The FCC could not have said that, because it
would have been forced -- if, as the theory goes, the
enhanced service has in it the separate product of
communications and has a separate status, then they
wouldn't have been able to take it out of Computer II.
But let me suggest, stepping back for a second
-- and, by the way, I should add that in this case, in the
paragraph 39 of the order under -- below, the FCC said the
two were not separable. Okay? I understand that to mean
they are ingredients intertwined, they are not separate
products. But the basic thing that the agency did here
was to decide which of two things is happening. Are these
two separate products? Is this communications and Chicken
McNuggets being bundled together? Or are these two
ingredients that are so interwoven, as they said in
Computer II, as to form a distinct product? -- is a
classic example of what an agency does, and it's really
not one that this Court, I think, would be likely to
secondguess. It is, indeed, in fact --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- I mean, I think the
difficulty that we're having is that it says it in the
cable context, and then it doesn't say it in the wire
context. And you can say it just as intelligibly in the
wire context.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Yeah.
JUSTICE SOUTER: It's just that you haven't been
saying it.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Let me try to clarify that,
Justice Souter. The reason why DSL meets the definition
of "telecommunications service" and we don't is because
the telephone companies do, in fact, provide the
transmission-only component. Now, the reason they do
that, Justice Souter, is, as Mr. Hungar said, historical,
though it wasn't without basis in reasons in history, but
they do, in fact, provide it separately. They do, because
Congress required them to do it through a separate
subsidiary in Computer II. There were reasons for that.
They wanted to avoid cross-subsidies, they were the only
platform, they were worried about discrimination.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So is that really the nub of
the difference? It's Congress that is requiring them to
do it separately, and Congress doesn't have a comparable
requirement with respect to cable.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: I would -- I read the statute
this way. Congress takes the world as it comes. If you
are providing it as a common carrier, then you fall within
-- you're providing it separately -- then you fall within
the definition of "telecommunications service." The DSL
guys are. If you are not, and we are not, then you don't
fall within --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but that begs the
question.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Your Honor, I --
JUSTICE SOUTER: It begs the question.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: It just says that it's for
someone else to decide the second prong of the NARUC test,
which is, Should you be compelled? Okay? The Congress
doesn't decide that. It's crazy to think that Congress
decided, forever and ever and ever, that everybody who
came in would be a common carrier, no matter what the
market looked like. Congress, instead, took the world as
it came, and it relies on the FCC to decide whether you
should be compelled, under the second prong of NARUC, to
be a common carrier. They have declined, in this case, to
extend that to us. That, I would say, is -- you know,
that's entitled to the utmost deference. It's a --
deciding not to extend their own rules. And there are
perfectly fine reasons for that. The reasons that pushed
them to do it in 1980 to the telephone companies, about
cross-subsidies, have no application to us. And the
discrimination justifications back then, when there was
only one platform, had no application to us. Now, you may
say, Is this an odd result that it comes out differently
at the end? Well, it is, and it is being dealt with. The
FCC is in the process of reconsidering, in the wireline
order, Wireline NPRM, whether it still makes sense to use
Computer II to impose a common-carrier obligation, an
obligation to do it separately, to provide the
communications separately, on the telephone companies. If
they decide that no longer is the case and that they don't
have to provide it separately, and the telephone companies
stop doing that, they will no longer fall within the
definition of "telecommunications service" under the
statute.
In other words, the statute asks, What are you,
in fact, doing? Okay? There are two ways you could be
providing it separately: if you choose to it or if you're
forced to do it. We've done neither. The telephone
companies have been forced to do it. Congress has -- and
they've decided we shouldn't be forced to do it, and
they're entitled to deference on that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Basically, you're saying
interstitial lawmaking, like other kinds of lawmaking, can
be reasonable without being absolutely consistent at a
given moment.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That still doesn't explain --
it still doesn't explain, to my satisfaction, why it
becomes a different product --
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Okay, let me try --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a different product when
you're selling it separately, and it is not a different
product when you're not selling it separately. I mean --
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Because, Your Honor, it's
whether the words "offering telecommunications" are
ambiguous. If I -- if I bake cakes, and someone was to
say, "If you offer cakes, you don't offer butter," there's
nothing in the English language, Justice Scalia, that
makes that unreasonable, that a person who offers cakes to
the public does not offer butter to the public. And if
you believe that example is correct, then you have to
uphold the FCC, because what it says is, the offer of the
final product is not offering, to the public, the
ingredient.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless you also sell butter.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Separately.
JUSTICE SCALIA: If you sell butter --
MR. CAPPUCCIO: Separately.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- separately, then when you
sell a cake --
MR. CAPPUCCIO: But, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you're selling butter.
MR. CAPPUCCIO: The ILECs do, we don't.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
Cappuccio.
Mr. Goldstein, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The Court will want to have handy, I think, the
red brief of the Respondents Earthlink, et al., because I
will repeatedly take you to the text of the statute, which
is reproduced at the appendix to that brief.
Mr. Chief Justice, cable modem service refers to
the bundled sale, purely for marketing reasons, of two
different things: highspeed telecommunications over cable
wires, and computer software, like e-mail, that you can
access over that highspeed telecommunications. The
Commission admits -- and it is a critical admission --
that the standalone sale of the telecommunications piece
is a telecommunications service, notwithstanding that it
is on cable wires rather than telephone wires. The Ninth
Circuit correctly held that it makes no difference that
cable companies market the telecommunications with e-mail
and the like.
Congress cannot have intended to empower
carriers to deregulate themselves through the nicety of
adding some further feature to their common carriage. And
I think we can demonstrate that through the text of the
statute. I'd like to take you to two provisions at the
outset.
The first one is on 2a of the appendix, and it
goes, Justice Souter, to the question of whether there's
some difference that Congress has adopted between
telephone wires and cable wires. And the answer to that
question is, no. Subparagraph 46, the definition of
"telecommunications service," this is the provision that
leads to common-carrier regulation. The term
"telecommunications service" means "the offering of
telecommunications for a fee directly to the public or to
such classes of users as to be effectively available
directly to the public" -- and here is the critical clause
-- "regardless of the facilities used." Congress made
quite clear it was not drawing any distinction based on
cable wire versus telephone.
I'd like to point you to two other provisions.
They are not reproduced, because they're in the cable --
separate cable provisions, but they will be relevant to
your question. That is 47 USC 541(d) and 522. Those
specifically contemplate that cable companies will be
common carriers. Now, that's the answer to the question,
Is there a difference between a cable wire and a telephone
wire?
Let me now step back to what the FCC said in its
ruling. The FCC backed into its decision here, and it
will turn on the definition of "information service,"
which will be on 1a of the appendix. It said this. Look,
cable modem service fits within the definition of an
"information service." It's this bundled thing. And we
construe the definition of an "information service" to be
mutually exclusive of a telecommunications service. And
that is legal error. And let me take you through the
definition.
Subparagraph 20, information service. The term
"information service" means the offering of a capability
for, in a variety of things -- generating, acquiring,
storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing,
or making available information -- via telecommunications.
That is not language of exclusivity; it is language of
dependence. There has to be telecommunications involved.
If you all came to the court today via car, or I came via
metro, there was a car or a train involved.
Now, I want to contrast that with another series
of statutory provisions. And what these provisions do is
demonstrate, beyond peradventure, that Congress address
the problem you are now facing. It said, "We recognize
that there are definitional provisions that might
otherwise fall within the definition of 'common carriage.'
And if we don't want it to be a common carrier, we will
tell you expressly."
There are four of them. They are reproduced.
Again at 1A, the definition of a "common carrier." It's
the exclusion that appears at the bottom of the
definition, three lines from the bottom, "But a person
engaged in radio broadcasting shall not, insofar as such
person is so engaged, be deemed a common carrier."
There's nothing like that for "information services."
There's going to be one specific table that I think will
be particularly illustrative.
The next one, the definition of a
"telecommunications carrier." It's at 2a. There's a
specific exclusion. Telecommunications carrier, these are
the people that are common carriers. The term
"telecommunications carrier" means "any provider of
telecommunications services except" -- so Congress drew
this out -- "except that such term does not include
aggregators of telecommunications services."
The next two, and they are the final two, are at
8a, one that deals with private mobile services -- it's
denoted subparagraph 2 -- "A person engaged in the
provision of a service that is a private mobile service
shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be
treated as a common carrier for any purposes under this
Act." There's a definitional category of "private mobile
service." We don't want it to be common carriage.
And the final one is the cable one, and I think
it's very illustrative -- right below that, subparagraph c
-- "Any cable system shall not be subject to regulation as
a common carrier or utility by reason of providing any
cable service." Nothing at all about an information
service.
Justice Scalia, you are quite right, this is a
case about a statute, and the language has none of the
indications that the Commission is relying on here.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it does have this, that
what -- if you look at the definition of
"telecommunications," it means "transmitting information
without change in the form or content of the information."
Now, in respect to some of their services -- not, maybe, a
lot, but in response to some -- they certainly change the
content and the form. E-mail, for example, does. And
there are a number of others that do. So the language,
says the FCC -- I look to "telecommunications service."
They provide telecommunications service sometimes, and
sometimes this other thing, as well, and it's all bundled.
And we read the word "offering" to mean "offering
separately." And so, therefore, a person who offers only
a bundled service is not a person who's offering a
telecommunications service. That's how I read it, as
trying to understand their argument. And it seemed to me
that argument is logical, and it fits the language.
Now, why is it -- are -- do you agree that it is
logical and fits the language, and at least get them that
far, or not?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: No.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: All right, let me take you
through both parts. Telecommunications -- we're going to
talk about the definition of "telecommunications" and what
it is to "offer."
They are wrong in suggesting that there is not
telecommunications here, and I can prove it two ways. The
first is, remember, "telecommunications" is the phrase in
the definition of "information service," as well. Let me
take you back to it.
JUSTICE BREYER: (Inaudible)
MR. GOLDSTEIN: "Information service" -- I
apologize -- is at 1a. The term "information service"
means "the offering of a capability for (inaudible) via
telecommunications." They're categorizing this thing as
an information service, so they have to be acknowledging
there's telecommunications involved. So, obviously, cable
modem service --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, no, but they're saying if
telecommunications and something else is involved, and
that's what you offer, you are not offering a
telecommunications service. That's their definition of
"offer," as "offer telecommunications service separately."
It would be obvious, for example, if you service were by
phone, to connect with the Library of Congress and you
owned the Library of Congress, as well as owning the
dedicated line. Then what you're doing is selling
information across the line. So they say that's what
they're doing, but just not as much.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Let me explain why I answered
them separately. Because the Commission's argument -- if
this -- Chenery -- you have to review a Commission
decision -- the Commission's argument was that there was
no telecommunications involved. This is a different
argument from the fact that there is no offering. That
appears in the Solicitor General's reply brief. So I
wanted to bracket, set aside. It says, "That can't be
right. The Commission is ruling based on a pure legal
error."
Let me turn to "offering." We're the only ones
that have provided a straightforward dictionary definition
of "offering." An "offering" is to make something
available. And you say, "All right, is the bundle making
available the telecommunications?" The answer to that
question is, yes. At the very least, it's yes in the
context of this statute, which is a common-carriage
statute.
Imagine the following hypotheticals, Justice
Breyer. Pick any form of common carriage you want. If
someone said, "I'm not just giving you the railroad
bridge, but I'm also selling you -- you have to buy from
me the train that's running on it and the grain that's in
the train." You couldn't avoid common carriage by forcing
your customers to buy the unified package together.
The second point is that, remember, the great,
great, great majority of communications have nothing to do
with their information services. I have cable modem
service. Lots of people do. What do I do? I get up in
the morning, and I go to newyorktimes.com, I go to
supremecourtus.gov. You'll be pleased. I --
[Laughter.]
MR. GOLDSTEIN: And that has nothing to do with
what they're offering. I have cable modem service. I
don't use the e-mail program that's offered to me by Star
Power. I have my own e-mail program. It's true, they've
given me some extra stuff, but one thing that you know for
sure is that doesn't deny that they have given me,
fundamentally, the capability to send the information back
and forth. Nothing changes. And I can illustrate this
for you.
Remember the concession that I started with.
They admit that if they sell it alone, then that's a
telecommunications service. They say it makes it
different -- a difference that you market them together.
But if I get one bill for that or two bills for that, it
works just the same. I send the information back and
forth, over and over again. There is absolutely no
difference.
Now, Justice Souter, I want to come back to
history, because that's -- seems to me the leg that they
hope that they have to stand on. I certainly don't think
they have a textual leg to stand on. Let me make some
points about the history.
The context for this is the Computer Inquiries
and the modified final judgement under AT&T, and they are
simply misdescribing the history. And I will take you to
the actual quotes for what happened.
First, let me take you to the definition of a
"basic service" and an "enhanced service" under the
Computer Inquiries, and that is reproduced at 23 of our
brief. And the point I'm going to make through this is --
what the Commission said over and over and over again
under the Computer Inquiries -- is this, if you have a
telecommunications piece, we're going to call it a "basic
service." If you add information processing on top of
that, we're going to call the whole thing an "enhanced
service." So far, everybody's on the same page.
But the piece that they're leaving out is that
they made different decisions, policy decisions, Justice
Scalia, about how, ultimately, to regulate them, but the
definition never changed. If you added the enhancement on
it, just like you add the e-mail on top of it, you still
had the basic service.
So here's the quote. It's at 23 of our brief.
"We find that basic service is limited to the common-
carrier offering" -- they're picking -- Congress is
picking up precisely the words in the Computer Inquiries
-- "of transmission capacity for the movement of
information; whereas, enhanced service combines basic
service with computer-processing applications." The basic
service remained.
And then the Commission and the D.C. Circuit
confronted just the problem you are. What happened is
that providers, under the Computer Inquiries and under the
modified final judgement, tried to combine the two things
and say, "We're no longer regulated." They said, "Yeah, I
know we had telecommunications, but now we want to add
something onto it." And I can take you to what the courts
said and what the Commission said, and that is at pages 24
to 25. And I think it's exactly what Congress would think
if it were confronted with this problem under the plain
definitions.
The second block quote on 24. This is when the
Commission was confronted with this problem. It said that
the argument that they're accepting now would allow
circumvention of the Computer II and Computer III basic
enhanced framework. AT&T would be able to avoid Computer
II and Computer III, unbundling --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, can't the
Commission change its mind, Mr. Goldstein?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, on this
question, the answer is, no, because Mr. Hungar has
conceded, and the Commission conceded below, that Congress
was adopting a definitional framework. I agree, Mr. Chief
Justice, that the Commission can change its policy
judgement about how it wants to regulate within the
definitional framework that Congress adopted. So you've
pointed me to a critical point, and that is to reinforce
--
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, I'm glad I did.
[Laughter.]
MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- and that is to reinforce
this. Our position is that the Computer Inquiries and the
AT&T MFJ had definitions: What's a basic service? What's
an enhanced service? Congress adopted those for the
purposes of the definition of a "telecommunications
service" and an "information service."
Now, you can make policy judgements about how to
regulate, although you're going to have to do it under the
forbearance regime adopted in a response to Justice
Scalia's opinion for the Court in MCI. But, nonetheless,
the definitions are what they are. This is a statute
that's being interpreted.
So, let me come back. So, what did the
Commission say under those definitions? AT&T would be
able to avoid Computer II and Computer III unbundling and
tariff requirements for any basic service that it could
combine with an enhanced service. You know, we've got the
telecommunications, like we're going to tack e-mail onto
it. This is obviously an undesirable and unintended
result.
The D.C. Circuit, faced with precisely the same
question under the framework that Congress intended to
adopt, that is on the next page, on page 25, right below
the block quote. The block quote sets up the problem.
The D.C. Circuit, however, rejected that conclusion, the
one that's being proposed here by the Commission, as a
strained interpretation of the language of the decree that
could not have been intended because it would allow the
BOCs to, quote, "create an enormous loophole" in the core
restriction of the decree.
So, Justice O'Connor, this comes back to your
point in the first half of the argument, and that is, it
becomes completely circular. If the point is that you
will only be subject to common-carrier regulation when you
decide to provide telecommunications service, nobody ever
will. Everybody will always bundle.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, but they say we have the
authority, if they -- if there is a bundled service, by
looking at the competitive necessity, market power, the
need to protect consumers, to insist that an offeror of
bundled service split the bundle and then be regulated.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: I agree. There are five
(inaudible) where the Solicitor General, sort of, pulls
the ripcord here.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: First, they have a Chenery
problem; and that is, this doesn't appear anywhere in the
Commission's ruling. What they said in the Commission's
ruling is that they could take a Title I information
service and regulate it as common carriage. This is an
entirely different animal. This is --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, but they're replying to
your argument, and they're saying it's really not right
that this means no regulation. And the reason it means no
regulation is because they've long had the authority to do
this, and then they cite some references where that is
pretty much what the Commission said.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: I still this is covered by
Chenery, but let's go to that. And so, here's the
proposition. The proposition is that the Commission has
the untethered authority to force someone to provide a
telecommunications service. And my question back to the
other side is, Where in the world in the statute is that?
There is no textural foundation for it whatsoever.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you take them as
having a broad -- if you take the statute as throwing this
whole problem in the lap of the Commission --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and then you say they have
authority, broadly, to interpret this term "offer," they
could give functional reasons, as in some circumstances,
to interpret the word "offer" to mean "offer
telecommunications separately," and, in other
circumstances, because they're functional differences, to
take a different position. Now, either they do or they
don't. If they don't, they're being inconsistent, and
that's the subject of a different legal proceeding. If
they do, so be it.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Let me deal with the premise
that Congress threw this into the lap of the FCC, and also
how it is they propose to deal with it, on that
assumption. The answer is, they did not throw it into the
lap of the FCC. The '96 Act enacted these definitions,
which are very carefully calibrated, for which there is no
text -- textual support. I will come back to "offering."
But Congress did enact a specific provision in MCI versus
AT&T. It addressed not only the concern of the majority,
but also the concerns of the dissenters, that the
Commission needed some flexibility. And it told the
Commission how to address this problem. It said, in the
forbearance procedures, "Here are the rules that you will
apply in deciding to lift regulation." They're quite
detailed. They're -- now, let me take you to them again
-- they're at the end of our -- I'm sorry, they are at --
in our appendix, at 3a. This is what Congress said.
Congress said, "We recognize the Commission needs some
flexibility, but there are going to be rules, and there
are going to be rules so courts can, for example, review,
later on, whether or not you're actually applying what we
-- doing what you want -- what we wanted you to do."
And here's what the Commission has to do,
according to Congress. And it's what the Commission did
not do here. I'm going to start with the indented
paragraphs, 1, 2, and 3, and then subparagraph b. It told
the Commission to look at whether or not the former
regulation is not necessary to ensure that the charges --
and skipping again -- are just and reasonable and are not
unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. Paragraph 2,
they have to make sure it's not necessary for the
protection of consumers, that it's in the public interest,
and that the competitive effects will be positive rather
than negative. The Commission did none of this,
notwithstanding that Congress specifically directed them
to.
Now, let me then turn to the question of whether
or not this is a reasonable interpretation of "offering."
Now, in different contexts, I admit, it's conceivable to
come up with different meanings of "offerings," but this
is a context, and I think if you take any example where
Congress actually -- I've given you the common carrier. I
don't think the railroad could ever get away with saying
it. I gave you the examples of the Computer Inquiries and
the AT&T MFJ, which are on point. But take anything that
Congress regulates. Take, for example, the fact that we
regulate offering of cigarettes to children. Now, a
merchandiser couldn't come along and say, "I'm not
offering cigarettes. What I've done is, I've created a
smoking service. I've taken the cigarettes, and I've put
a lighter in it, and you've just got one bill that you
have to pay for it." The idea that that would evade what
Congress is concerned about is loopy.
Think about what Congress is concerned about
with common-carriage regulations. There are three
principal consequences to being a telecommunications
service. And imagine if any of them changed a whit,
except to favor us, when you bundle the e-mail with it.
First, nondiscrimination. Would Congress want
you to have to charge just and reasonable rates to a
competitor any less when you're selling e-mail with the
telecommunications than the telecommunications alone? No.
Interconnection. Would Congress want a cable
modem service network to be less interconnected with all
the other networks simply because it has e-mail or a Web
browser on it? I don't know why, I suppose Congress would
want to be more sure, because there are more messages.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But the Congress
apparently wanted to go in the direction of deregulation
here.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it's a
fair point, and it is basically -- aside for the, sort of,
nod at history, it -- Mr. Hungar started with that. And
our point is that Congress told them how to deregulate,
and that --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about Congress
thinking, quite honestly, if they -- people do think about
it. I have no idea how broadband service will be provided
20 years from now. There may be a thousand competitors.
There may be wireless. People may be broadcasting it
through their teeth. I don't know --
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE BREYER: -- what it's going to be. But
since I don't know and have really no idea whether it
should or should not be regulated, because I don't know
the competitive situation, let's leave it up to the FCC.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: It did that, but with a critical
concession. It said --
JUSTICE BREYER: It sort of it did that in
broadcasting, didn't it? I guess they could have written
it to say that "the FCC shall regulate common-carrier
communications in the public interest, convenience, and
necessity," which would put the FCC in the same situation
with regard to this, as it's in with regard to
broadcasting.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: I think it's a very fair
comparison. But also, Justice Breyer, I think -- you
know, I think we're all on the same page about what
Congress intended, and that is, first of all, Congress was
aware of cable modem service. That's said expressly in
the Court's opinion in Gulf Power. It was emphasized by
the cable industry in Gulf Power itself. There is --
there are several statutory provisions that refer to cable
companies being common carriage. But, Justice Breyer,
what they said is this, "We have broad encompassing
definitions, and that is, it's not going to make a
difference if you combine two things together. But,
Commission, you go make those" -- Justice Breyer, all the
findings you're talking about are listed in the section 10
forbearance proceedings.
Now, imagine the world as the Commission sees
it. It says that forbearance applies to
telecommunications service. But when it comes to things
that aren't telecommunications service, it's "Katie bar
the door." We don't have any rules. What kind of logical
regulatory scheme is that? And that is that the
Commission is constrained with respect to its expertise.
But things that are information services that are outside
telecommunications, it can do whatever it wants.
Justice Breyer, I did want to make one
additional point, and that is, again, there is a statutory
provision here that addresses their claim that they can
force you to provide telecommunications service, and that
is the definition of a "telecommunications carrier." And
it is on 2a. I read the exception, so now I'm dealing
with the second sentence of the definition, "A
telecommunications carrier shall be treated as a common
carrier under this Act only to the extent that it is
engaged in providing telecommunications services."
This lines up perfectly with this Court's
decision in Midwest Video. There was a constraint on what
it -- what regulation you could impose on broadcasters.
This one says, "You are only going to be a common carrier
if you're providing a telecommunications service." But
the FCC has this vision that it can, sort of, solve all
the problems through its raw discretion and to force
someone to provide common carriage. But the statute's
very clear, if you are not providing a telecommunications
service, you are not going to be a telecommunications
carrier; and, therefore, you are not going to be providing
common carriage.
And, as I've said, I don't understand how it is,
even if one looked at this particular context, you could
decide that Congress thought the bundle made regulation
less regulated -- less necessary, rather than more
regulated -- more necessary.
I want, next, if I could, to talk about the
notion that you can self-deregulate, and how utterly
implausible this is, how is it that the Commission could
imagine that Congress created the following regime. And
that is, if you want to provide common carriage, you'll be
subject to this regulation; but if you don't feel like it,
well, that's okay. That will render the definition of
"telecommunications service" -- if you just want to tack
e-mail onto the thing, that will render the definition of
"telecommunications service" -- in the Internet, you're a
dead letter, because who in the world would ever do it?
If it's up to the regulated entity, why in the world would
anyone provide common carriage?
I think this has, actually, a remarkable
parallel to the Court's decision in the Oneida Indian
Nation case, where the Court rejected the suggestion that
what you could do is -- that it would be up to the Indians
to decide whether or not they would be able to get
property back. This is what the Court said, "If OIN may
unilaterally reassert sovereign control and remove those
parcels from the local tax rolls, little would prevent the
tribe from initiating a new generation of litigation to
free the parcels" -- remember, they're free from all
regulation at all -- "free the parcels from land zone --
local zoning or other regulatory controls that protect all
landowners in the area."
And then, Justice Ginsburg, the opinion goes on
to talk about section 465, which is exactly like section
10 forbearance, "Recognizing these practical concerns,
Congress has provided a mechanism for the acquisition of
the lands. The regulations implementing section 465 are
sensitive to the complex interjurisdictional concerns that
arise when the tribe seeks to retain -- regain sovereign
control over territory. The Secretary must consider" --
and it lists a whole series of things.
And the parallel, I think, is exact. You can't
have Congress enacting a scheme that tells you how to do
it.
Now, let me return to, then, Mr. Cappuccio's
suggestion, Justice Scalia, that this is an ingredient,
it's not a product. The straightforward answer is,
there's no mention of ingredients or products in the
statute. It says "telecommunications service." And the
question under the definition of "telecommunications
service" is, Are you providing telecommunications? Yeah,
the information's going back and forth. Is it to the
public? Sure, anybody can buy it. Is there a fee? You
bet, it's kind of expensive, actually. And that's all
that Congress cared about.
Now, this is not a question of whether or not
there's butter in a cake, because you -- it -- there are
two reasons. The first is, fundamentally, the
telecommunications is the same; it hasn't been "cooked"
into something else. And the second --
JUSTICE SOUTER: There's butter on the cake, not
in the cake.
[Laughter.]
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.
The second is, the reason all those
hypotheticals are -- wheels and cars and those sorts of
things -- don't make any sense here is that they assume a
few things. The first is, they're assuming a first sale
that gets regulated. Somebody buys the butter, somebody
buys the tires and gets regulated. But under their rules
it's never regulated at all. The telecommunications just,
poof, escapes all regulation. And the second is that, in
the car example, it's because there's -- the reason it has
intuitive appeal is that there's a regulatory scheme about
cars. So Congress has decided how all the inputs will be
regulated together.
But, again, remember the consequence of sticking
this into the unregulated "information services" box is,
it's all gone. There's no regulation of it whatsoever.
It's just not a scheme that makes any sense.
If there are no further questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
Goldstein.
Mr. Hungar, you have four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 04-281
MR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Turning first to the question of the regulatory
history, Respondents continue to rely on the fact that,
under Computer II, the FCC required telephone common
carriers to separate out and separately offer the basic
transmission component. But, importantly, and what
refutes Respondent's attempts to rely on history, Congress
did not -- excuse me -- the FCC did not impose that
requirement on enhanced service providers. There were
entities called "value-added networks" that obtained the
telecommunications functionality, bundled it together with
information servicing protocol conversion-type computer
functions, and offered that bundled service as an enhanced
service. And the Commission said, in Computer II, "That
is an unregulated enhanced-service offering, it is not
subject to Title II of the Act, because we don't think
Congress intended Title II, which is aimed at traditional
telephone communications, to deal with this new form of
intermingled integrated service." It is not regulated,
even though it is true that there was a communications
component. And, under Respondent's rationale, that offer
or that value-added network should have been required to
make it file a tariff and comply with all the regulations
of Title II of the Act. And footnote 5 of our reply brief
cites the orders discussing this fact.
And in addition, under Computer II, the
Commission required AT&T and, later, the Regional Bell
Operating Companies, if they were going to offer enhanced
services, to offer them separately through subsidiaries,
unregulated subsidiaries, even though they were offering
bundles of enhanced service and telecommunications, the
telecommunications, which they obtained under tariff from
their parent corporation. But the entire bundled offering
was unregulated. And that's been true for 25 years.
And, again, Congress, in 1996, gave no
indication that it was overturning this well-established
situation in which enhanced services, now information
services, were not regulated. And to suggest that
Congress, in an act that talks about preserving the hands-
off approach to the Internet, in fact, regulated all
Internet Service Providers in a way that they had never
been regulated before, we submit, is certainly an unlikely
interpretation of the act, and clearly demonstrates that
the FCC was reasonable in rejecting that position.
Justice Breyer, you asked about voicemail or
similar type systems that would preserve a message. If
provided by a computer functionality, that service is an
information service. Voicemail is an information service.
But the FCC has at least suggested that voicemail and
basic telecommunications -- if a telephone company tried
to offer it -- say, "We're going to offer this bundled,
and we don't think it's regulated," telephone companies
try that sort of thing from time to time, and then the FCC
is faced with a decision, in its discretion, of whether
that should be viewed as an integrated offering or,
instead, as really two things that have just been added
together but aren't really -- that are really two distinct
services. And the FCC has suggested, in that context,
that telephone service and voicemail service, even if
they're bundled together, are two distinct services.
And there's an important difference, I think,
between that type of offering and the one here. You can
use your -- even if your telephone company offers you
voicemail, obviously, you -- a lot of your use of the
telephone system has nothing to do with the voicemail;
it's pure telephony, pure telecommunications; whereas,
with cable modem service, every time you use it,
essentially, you are utilizing at least some of the data-
processing, computer-enhanced functionality that is being
provided by your -- by your Internet Service Provider --
the domain-name system, as we discussed, caching. For
instance, Mr. Goldstein says he goes to supremecourtus.gov
every morning. I suspect he doesn't actually go to this
Court's computer. He probably gets at least the first
page off of the cache, which provided by the ISP.
