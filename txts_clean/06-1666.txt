(10:14 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 06-1666, and the
consolidated Case 07-394, Munaf versus Geren, Secretary
of the Army, and Geren versus Omar.
Mr. Garre.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE
ON BEHALF OF PETE GEREN,
SECRETARY OF THE ARMY, ET AL.
MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Under this Court's precedents and universal
international law norms, the government of Iraq, like
all sovereign nations, has a sovereign right and
jurisdiction to try and punish individuals, including
American citizens, who voluntarily enter its borders,
commit crimes in its country, and remain there. In two
independent respects, the court of appeals in the Omar
case lost sight of that principle and departed from this
Court's precedents: First by exercising habeas
jurisdiction at all; and second by sustaining an
injunction that the court of appeals itself recognized
prevented the government of Iraq from trying and
punishing Mr. Omar for any crimes that he committed in
Iraq.
As to the jurisdictional question, we
believe that this Court's decision Hirota versus
MacArthur points to the conclusion that habeas
jurisdiction is lacking over these cases because the
habeas petitioners are being held under international
authority pursuant to determinations made by an
international Multinational Force acting and carrying
out a United Nations mandate, and in Mr. Munaf's case
pursuant to an order of the Iraqi courts that he remain
in custody while proceedings go forward in the trial
court.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the problem with the
argument that Hirota did not at any point in the per
curiam opinion saying -- say, we're coming to the
conclusion that we come to of no jurisdiction because
there's an international force? I mean, Hirota said,
you know, there's this, that, and the other thing, and
under all these circumstances we don't think there's
jurisdiction. Well, one of the things that's different
here is you had Japanese soldiers in Hirota and you've
got American citizens here.
MR. GARRE: Well, that is the difference,
Justice Souter. And I think, to be clear, if this Court
does find jurisdiction in these cases, we think that
citizenship would be a basis -- would have to be the
basis for jurisdiction, and we urge this Court to limit
its decision to that ruling, because that would have
profound practical consequences.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's another
difference, too. There was a conviction and a sentence
in Hirota, here in Omar's case he has not yet been as
far as we know even investigated by the Iraqi courts,
certainly no conviction; and in Munaf's case the
conviction has been quashed.
MR. GARRE: That's true, and let me explain
why we think that Hirota does govern the circumstances
in this case, notwithstanding that this case involves
citizens and notwithstanding that the Petitioners in
Hirota had been the subject of an international
conviction. First of all, we don't think that Hirota
would have come out differently if the habeas
petitioners had filed suit earlier and sought to enjoin
the international proceeding in Hirota and sought an
injunction that would have prevented the conviction from
taking case.
Secondly, we do think that, although one
obviously has to take a careful look at the Court's
decision in Hirota, we think that what the Court did say
points to the conclusion that it was the international
authority that was key to the Court's finding that there
was no jurisdiction. I think there's at least a couple
--
JUSTICE SOUTER: If it is, there's
something -- the implication of that I think is what is
bothersome, because in effect it means, if that rule is
applied to this case, it means that the president acting
alone can make an agreement for an international force
or a cooperative force and that agreement of the
executive alone in effect eliminates habeas jurisdiction
over an American citizen. And that obviously is in
tension, if not inconsistent, with the suspension clause
and it's a little scary.
MR. GARRE: Well, obviously the Court
reached that conclusion in Hirota as to aliens. With
respect to citizens, I think that the key for the
jurisdictional question under the habeas statute is
whether or not these individuals are in custody under
and by color of United States authority. Just as the
Court presumably concluded in Hirota that the
petitioners in Hirota were not under custody under color
of United States authority, we think that the
Petitioners here are not. And so we think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but in real world terms
isn't it the case that they are under United States
authority? You've got an American commander, you've
straight-line authority right through, and -- and one
knows -- to be realistic, one knows perfectly well that
if any order were given to the American military
involved, they would not hand them over, i.e., they
would obey the order, international -- agreement for
international cooperation or not.
MR. GARRE: If I can make --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Go ahead.
MR. GARRE: -- two points in response to
that. First, ultimately the United Nations controls the
strings and the source and the scope of international
authority. The -- the current Security Council
resolutions are set to expire in December. It could --
it could eliminate those resolutions today and that
source of international authority would exist and we
wouldn't be here arguing that these individuals are
being held pursuant to international mandate.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, just to
clarify one point. The -- at the time of the briefing,
the U.N. resolution was due to expire in December of
2007. Has it been renewed.
MR. GARRE: There has been a subsequent
resolution. It's Resolution 1790, and that resolution
is set to expire this December. And the -- the
government of Iraq and the other parties have indicated
that this will be the last extension. Obviously,
they'll have to assess the situation in December. But
the international authority that existed at the time of
the briefing continues to exist.
The other point I was going to make,
Justice Souter, is your point about American domination
or influence over the Multinational Force was equally
true with respect to the force in Hirota. You had --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I think -- I think you're
right.
MR. GARRE: So I don't think that that's a
basis for distinguishing Hirota. The --
JUSTICE SOUTER: It may be -- I mean, Hirota
was a literally, I think, a two- or three-day per curiam
opinion. It occupied less than a page, and it had this
kind of whole ball of wax sort of reasoning involved in
it.
And as precedential authority, if this case
turned on the question of whether we look to the theory
of international authority rather than, I think, the
realistic fact of American domination, I don't think
Hirota is a very strong precedent against our at least
taking the realistic view of it.
MR. GARRE: Well, again, I think that Hirota
-- the amount of influence that the United States forces
have over the international force isn't a basis for
distinguishing Hirota.
But to get to your point about citizenship,
I guess we would say a few things.  One, we that think
the Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in Hirota
and the court of appeals below recognized that the
theory of the Court's decision in Hirota doesn't lend
itself to a citizenship exception. The habeas statute,
as this Court emphasized in the Rasul case, doesn't have
a citizenship -- doesn't distinguish between citizens
and aliens, and it has since 1789 contained the
requirement that the person be in custody under or by
color of United States' authority. So --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So once again you're
relying on a concurring opinion by Justice Douglas?
MR. GARRE: Not the concurring opinion.
We're relying on the Court's decision in Hirota, but we
look at the concurring opinion; we've looked at the
briefs. We've tried to discern the best principle of
law from that decision. And the principle that we think
it stands for is that where individuals are held under
international authority by the judgment of several
nations, not the law of any single nation, this Court
lacks jurisdiction to review the custody of such
individuals.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, it is at least
equally plausible, I think, because it's the only factor
that Hirota mentions more than once, that the Court was
going on its lack of power "to review, to affirm, set
aside, or annul the judgments and sentences imposed"
there. And here we have no judgment or sentence.
So I don't think you can pick one of these
strands, citizenship, and say, oh, that's it and it
isn't the judgment and sentence. So I think we know
your position. This is an opinion that says "under the
foregoing circumstances." I don't think you can take it
much further than saying citizenship was one of those
circumstances.
MR. GARRE: If I can make a couple of
points. One, the parties in Hirota, the habeas
petitioners, made very clear that they weren't asking
this Court to review the international conviction. They
made very clear that they were asking this Court to
review the actions of American officers under United
States law. They made that clear on page 14 of their
merits brief, where they said -- and I'm quoting here --
"We are not asking this Court to review the decision of
international court" -- end quote. And quoting again:
"All the questions deal solely with official actions
taken by General MacArthur as citizen and U.S. Army
officer." -- end quote. And again on page 15, quote:
"We repeat again that we bring into question only
unlawful action taken by General MacArthur for us."
The other point that I would make is these
individuals -- they haven't been convicted pursuant to a
trial, like the individuals in Hirota, but these
individuals are being held pursuant to determinations
made by the Multinational Force carrying out the
international mandate.
In Mr. Omar's case, he not only received a
three-judge tribunal shortly after his detention and
capture, but he also received a determination before a
nine-officer combined review release board, consisting
of six Iraqi officials and three Multinational Force
officials, who determined that he was a security
internee who should be detained in accordance with the
United Nations mandate.
Now, Mr. Munaf's case did proceed before the
Iraqi criminal court because an injunction was not
entered against those proceedings. The Iraqi court
initially did enter a conviction. That conviction was
reversed on appeal by the court of cassation. We think
that -- that the recent decision is significant in a
couple of respects. I think, one, it underscores there
is an Iraqi legal system, that that system is capable of
processing these cases and hearing from these
individuals, and is capable of granting relief where
appropriate action isn't taken.
And, two, the Iraqi court order setting
aside the conviction, much like an appellate order in
this country would, remanded the case for further
proceedings but directed that Mr. Munaf and his
codefendant --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If it's in the materials,
then perhaps I should have known, but did the -- I take
it Munaf was present and was represented by counsel?
MR. GARRE: Yes, both.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But how did that work?
Was he present in American custody and then he goes to
the Iraqi court?
MR. GARRE: The individuals are detained by
the Multinational Force while there are proceedings
before the Iraqi court --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So then he just goes every
day to the Iraqi court and then he comes back at night
to U.S. custody?
MR. GARRE: Yes. In Mr. Munaf's case, there
were four investigative hearings and a trial, after
which he was convicted.
In Mr. Omar's case, if he were -- if the
proceedings were allowed to go forward, he would remain
in MNF-I custody during the course of the Iraqi
proceedings. And then, if there is a conviction and
that conviction is sustained on appeal, the Iraqi
government issues an order, a transfer order, to the
Multinational Force. The Multinational Force makes a
determination to carry out that order.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are --
MR. GARRE: And, again --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are in the U.S.
custody a number of non-citizens. Is that -- how many
people are being held in the custody of
the Multinational Force that the United States controls?
MR. GARRE: There are 24,000 people
currently being held by the Multinational Force, the
vast majority of whom obviously are aliens. Two
thousand individuals held by the Multinational Force
have been transferred to Iraqi custody. Many if not
most of those individuals have undergone court
proceedings because the Multinational Force is obviously
working in close coordination with the Iraqi government
to bring to justice people who have committed crimes in
Iraq.
And if I could turn to the second question,
because we think that there is --
JUSTICE BREYER: One more -- I'd like -- on
the first question, in reading through this, my
impression was that the government -- and the green
briefs, you know, the dark green briefs against you from
the Military Justice Institute and the national security
specialists really don't disagree. That is that
everybody seems to agree, to use the words General Casey
said, that U.S. soldiers in Iraq are subject to the
authority, direction, and control of the commander of
the U.S. Central Command. And you say in your brief
that really this multilateral force operates subject to
a unified American command, and the chain of command
ultimately runs to the President. So as a practical
matter it's the President and the Pentagon, the
Secretary of Defense, and the American commanders that
control what our American soldiers do.
I take it there's agreement on that point,
but where there's disagreement is that you say, well,
the same was true with that tribunal at issue in Hirota.
Am I right about that?
MR. GARRE: We say the same is true with
respect to the allied forces --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. So we're not -- we're
not -- I take its you say that, as a practical matter
and as a matter of the chain of command, it runs through
American officers to American commanders to the
Secretary of Defense to the President of the United
States. There is no disagreement about that, or is
there?
MR. GARRE: There is not, Justice Breyer.
An American --
JUSTICE BREYER: There is not.
MR. GARRE: -- official has the supreme
command --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay. Then if there
is not -- if there is not, am I right in thinking the
issue is whether, because the words -- there's some
connection with foreign governments, absolutely.
There's some, but it doesn't interfere with that chain
of command. And now your point is: But the same was
true with the tribunal at issue in Hirota.
MR. GARRE: The same was true with respect
not only to the tribunal, but the allied forces --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes.
MR. GARRE: -- in Hirota.
JUSTICE BREYER: The same was true. It was
General MacArthur.
MR. GARRE: That's correct. And ultimately
the key point, we think, is that those forces were
acting under international mandate. The Far Eastern
Commission in Hirota ultimately had say over what the
force could do --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well --
MR. GARRE: -- whereas the United Nations
here ultimately has.
JUSTICE BREYER: But that's because the
President, I take it, would follow what the UN says, not
because the chain of command would change.
MR. GARRE: Well, I think that that's true,
but the point I wanted to make is that the United
Nations today could repeal the resolutions authorizing
this international force and the specific mission.
JUSTICE BREYER: And if that happened, these
people would be released?
MR. GARRE: They would be under the
authority of the United States. We wouldn't be here
arguing that this Court didn't have jurisdiction. So,
ultimately, an international body distinct from the
United States is controlling the strings --
JUSTICE BREYER: But the relevance of that
is General MacArthur was an agent of several allied
powers.
MR. GARRE: As is, in our view, General
Petraeus. He is sharing now the authority --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then, to me, it's a matter
of Hirota at the moment, and the only distinction you
haven't addressed is at that time, I think in 1946, the
basic habeas rule was that you wouldn't question a
judgment of a tribunal, at least not a foreign tribunal.
And it was just beginning in the issue -- to question
judgments in American tribunals. And, therefore, the
obvious question is: Well, doesn't that explain Hirota?
MR. GARRE: I don't think it does, for the
reasons that I have already indicated to
Justice Ginsburg. That wasn't the argument the parties
were making in Hirota. They went out of their way to
say that they weren't challenging the international
conviction, that they were challenging the actions of
the American officers acting under international law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Court certainly
listed it as a circumstance; and, as I said before, it's
the only thing that's repeated in the opinion. But I
think that we've come to a standoff on that.
MR. GARRE: It did. And if I could turn now
to the second issue, because we do think there is a --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just one
question. Would your argument be the same if the place
of detention was in the United States?
MR. GARRE: Analytically, it would be the
same, Justice Stevens. As a practical matter, United
States forces don't act under international authority;
and, thank goodness, Multinational Forces don't act in
the United States.
It would make a difference as to the second
question, which is to say if the individuals were
detained in the United States and there was a question
of transferring back to Iraq, that would be a classic
extradition situation. And we'd have a whole different
body of case law governing these individuals --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose if he
were -- it would make a huge difference whether such an
individual were released in the United States as opposed
to being released in Iraq.
MR. GARRE: Absolutely. In Iraq it's
undisputed that if the Multinational Force were to
release them, the Iraqi authorities could arrest them,
take them into their custody. The injunction that we
face today is one preventing the Iraqi courts from going
forward with any proceedings against Mr. Omar,
preventing the Multinational Force from sharing
information with Iraqi authorities about the
circumstances of his release, and directly preventing
the Multinational Force from transferring these
individuals to Iraqi custody if they are convicted.
The laws of this Court -- we go back to Reid
versus Covert, The Schooner Exchange -- makes clear that
when American citizens go abroad voluntarily into other
countries, commit crimes in those countries, and remain
in those countries, they cannot come back to this
country and complain about the offenses they committed,
nor complain about the modes of trial and punishment
available in those countries.
The Court made that express in the Neely
versus Henkel case. And at least on the second
question, we think that that principle establishes that
the U.S. force, even assuming it has habeas jurisdiction
to review their detention by the MNF-I, shouldn't be in
a position of directly thwarting Iraq's sovereign right
and jurisdiction to try these individuals and, if they
find that they committed offenses, punish them for
offenses committed in Iraq. American citizens --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a limit to
your proposition? In other words, let's stipulate that
the individuals are going to be released in a situation
where you know that they won't receive anything
resembling due process and will be subject to abuse.
What happens in that case?
MR. GARRE: I think we would maintain that
American citizens, when they go abroad, they have to
take what they get. I think there is some suggestion --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, could they be
released to a lynch mob?
MR. GARRE: What -- I think what this Court
said in Neely versus Henkel -- and I'm quoting from page
122, and I think it partially answers your question,
Justice Kennedy: "The Suspension Clause has no relation
to crimes committed without the jurisdiction of the
United States and against the laws of a foreign
country."
If this Court thinks that it would be
different if there were no system of fairness or
process, then it could reserve that question for another
case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But habeas corpus is
concerned with the safety of the prisoner to the extent
that it's controlled by our authorities. And if you're
in the United States, could an officer release a
prisoner knowing that a lynch mob was outside? I should
think not.
MR. GARRE: No. And here, Justice Kennedy,
the Iraqi courts are functioning under principles that
require fundamental standards and --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, this is just a
hypothetical question.
MR. GARRE: Right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course.
MR. GARRE: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And do you agree
that -- do you concede that habeas is concerned with the
safety of the individual as opposed to his custody?
MR. GARRE: Habeas, as this Court has made
clear, is concerned with the fact or duration of
custody. I think if we're talking about things that
could happen to people that would be a different type of
action. American courts might be open in that extreme
situation. I don't think that would be an exercise
that's ever been available in habeas.
I think that the closest analog of this
Court's cases to this situation is perhaps Wilson versus
Girard, where you had an American serviceman stationed
in Japan who committed alleged offenses in Japan, and
the Japanese authorities made a request that they take
jurisdiction of that person to prosecute him for
offenses in Japan, and this Court considered the
question. There was an injunction against the transfer
of that individual to Japanese authorities. This Court
set the injunction aside because it found no affirmative
bar on the exercise of that discretion, recognizing the
sovereign right and jurisdiction of the Government of
Japan to prosecute individuals, including American --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's an important
distinction, I think. At least in this case it has been
alleged that if these people are released to Iraqi
custody, there is a high risk that they will be subject
to torture and other abuse.
You know the brief that was filed on behalf
of the NGOs where there is a quotation from Iraq's
deputy justice minister: "We cannot control the
prisons. It's as simple as that. Our jails are
infiltrated by the militias from top to bottom, from
Gaza to Baghdad."
MR. GARRE: Let me make a practical and a
legal point on that, Justice Ginsburg. First, as a
practical matter, it is important to keep in mind that
reports of torture and abuses in the Iraqi system all
deal with the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry
of Defense. We point that out --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a quotation from
the deputy justice minister.
MR. GARRE: And I don't believe he was
pointing to any reports of systematic abuses within the
department, the Ministry of Justice. And that's what
our -- our own State Department concluded in its most
recent reports on this. And if you look at all the
reports, including the most recent report that came out
a couple weeks ago from the United Nations Assistance
Mission in Iraq, they point to alleged abuses within the
Ministry of Interior and Defense. These individuals
would be going to the justice system. We don't have
reports of systematic --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that -- doesn't
that issue that you raise at least deserve litigation
before the court?
MR. GARRE: No, and that was the legal point
that I was going to make. Even in the extradition
context, where everyone agrees that there would be
habeas jurisdiction to review a transfer for some
reason, the courts have not entertained allegations of
torture, recognizing that those considerations are
uniquely for the executive, except when --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why shouldn't they? I
mean, if a -- if a court may consider the imminence of
lynch-mob action either sanctioned by the requesting
government or tolerated by it, why cannot the same point
be made about a claim of torture if there is at least
enough color in the claim to say there's something to
inquire into?
MR. GARRE: I think because for centuries,
Justice Souter, the courts have recognized that these
are matters for the executive to assess, because --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why don't you have --
why isn't your answer different in the lynch-mob case?
MR. GARRE: Well, I think there we weren't
talking about habeas. I think if -- and my answer was
if the Court is concerned about that situation, this
isn't it. It can reserve it for a different case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: A lynch mob doesn't require
investigation by American courts of the internal
workings of a foreign government.
MR. GARRE: Well, that's true,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but I think it would be
quite extraordinary to investigate the Government of
Iraq. That's a matter that the executive can take into
account.
MR. GARRE: That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But It would be a strange
thing for an American court to do.
MR. GARRE: That's what the district court,
the court of appeals, and maybe this Court would have to
do if it were going to entertain allegations of --
JUSTICE ALITO: In answer to a previous
question, I understood you to say that if the
individuals here were tried by an Iraqi tribunal they
would remain in the custody of the Multinational Force
during the course of the trial. Is that correct? Does
that mean that they would simply be transported to court
and then brought back to the custody where they are at
the present time during the course of those proceedings?
MR. GARRE: That's right, and General Garner
explained that on page 48 of the appendix.
The other thing I want to make on torture --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, just to follow up on
that, at what point during that, during the trial, would
there be any potential for torture by Iraqi authorities.
MR. GARRE: There would be none,
Justice Alito. And these individuals are represented by
Iraqi counsel, by American counsel. They have access to
Iraqi ombudsmen. They can make reports. They can make
reports, as some detainees have, to the Iraqi
investigative judges of alleged mistreatment; not
torture, but Iraqi investigative judges have directed
that mistreatment not occur.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but once they're
turned over to the prison authorities they're in the
situation that the NGO brief describes. I mean, that's
it seems to me ultimately what the concern is.
MR. GARRE: It's not the situation that the
NGO brief described, because all of those reports are
focused on Ministry of Interior and Defense, where these
individuals are not going to -- U.S. court, even in the
extradition context, don't review these allegations --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I guess that just
gets me back to my earlier question. Isn't that
something that ought to be explored as an evidentiary
matter in determining whether there should be a
permanent injunction?
MR. GARRE: I don't think so. Respect for
the prerogative of the executive in making its
determinations, respect for the sovereignty of the Iraqi
courts. You have a habeas court having discovery and
who knows what types of proceedings as to what is going
on in Iraqi's criminal justice system. I think this
Court would give respect to the justice systems of other
sovereign nations. This is a system which, as we say in
our brief, is founded on principles of fairness.
If I could reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Garre.
Mr. Margulies?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH MARGULIES
ON BEHALF OF MUNAF, ET AL.
AND OMAR, ET AL.
MR. MARGULIES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
To resolve any confusion about the habeas
Petitioners' claims, I'd like to focus on two points
this morning. The first is we believe the
jurisdictional question is governed by the following
rule: When a United States citizen is detained abroad
by United States military officials who have effective
authority and control over his continued detention, as
Mr. Garre concedes is the case today, the United States
district court has jurisdiction over that citizen's
habeas petition.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did General
MacArthur have effective jurisdiction and control in
Japan?
MR. MARGULIES: Frankly, Your Honor, the
record in that regard is unclear. As we point out in
our, brief, Solicitor General Pearlman argued precisely
the opposite. But let us concede for the moment that he
would, that Justice Douglas had the better of that
position, which the Court in Hirota did not resolve.
Our position, Your Honor, is that it is
irrelevant to this question, because the problems that
doomed the habeas applications in Hirota had nothing to
do with MacArthur's status in the chain of command. The
problems with Hirota were these:
Nothing in General MacArthur's status as an
American officer would have transformed those
petitioners from enemy aliens to American citizens.
Nothing in General MacArthur's status would have
transformed their complaint as something other than an
attack on the judgment and sentences of an international
tribunal imposed upon them. That, in fact, is exactly
what the Court said in its nine sentences in Hirota,
that it was an attack on the judgment and sentences
imposed upon them by an international tribunal.
And lastly, vis a vis the narrow question
before the Court in Hirota, nothing in General
MacArthur's status would have made this anything other
than an improper attempt to invoke the original and
appellate jurisdiction of this Court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Does your case -- does
your case depend entirely on the fact that these are
American citizens?
MR. MARGULIES: It is a sufficient ground,
Your Honor, but it does not --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If they were not American
citizens, would there be jurisdiction?
MR. MARGULIES: We believe there would be
jurisdiction, Your Honor, but no basis to proceed --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So then citizenship is
irrelevant on the jurisdictional issue?
MR. MARGULIES: Only vis a vis jurisdiction,
Your Honor, but I would stress we disagree very
vigorously with Mister -- with the government that if
jurisdiction were to extend here to foreign nationals, a
position on which we take no issue -- that it would
be --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't know how you can
avoid taking that question. That what bothers me. How
can you avoid addressing that question?
MR. MARGULIES: Frankly, Your Honor, we are
inclined to agree with Justice Scalia's position in --
my interpretation of the habeas statute accords with
Justice Scalia's view of the interpretation of the
statute giving a right to citizens --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you aware of any cases
in which we have held that habeas jurisdiction is
available to a citizen where it would be not available
to a non-citizen?
MR. MARGULIES: No, Your Honor.
And as I say, what we know from -- certainly
with made explicit in Eisentrager, where the Court
described citizenship as a head of jurisdiction and then
reaffirmed for people detained abroad, some detained
pursuant to international authority, like Toth v.
Quarles, Burns v. Wilson, Wilson v. Girard, Ex parte
Hayes, Gualiardo --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this second
question: Do you think the place of detention has any
relevance to the issue?
MR. MARGULIES: No, Your Honor. And one of
the worrisome positions --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think whether or
not it's a -- there are ongoing hostilities would have
any relationship to the issue?
MR. MARGULIES: We think that that question
is answered in Hamdi, Your Honor. We do not challenge
the zone of military discretion that exists at the
moment of capture.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But you say that does not
exist in Iraq today?
MR. MARGULIES: Oh, no, we do accept that it
exists in Iraq today, Your Honor. And we are not
challenging -- Your Honor, in this case we did not file
the habeas petition until Mr. Omar had been in custody
for -- in United States custody, for more than a year.
We did not file in Munaf until Mr. Munaf had been in
United States custody for more than a year.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the place of detention
has always been Iraq?
MR. MARGULIES: I'm sorry, Your Honor?
JUSTICE STEVENS: The place of detention has
always been Iraq?
MR. MARGULIES: Yes, Your Honor. The United
States has made the decision to retain these people --
they have moved them around within Iraq, but they have
made the decision to keep them in Iraq.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would the legal issue be
the same if there were violent ongoing hostilities in
Iraq?
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, we accept that
there are violent ongoing hostilities in Iraq, but the
United States government takes the position that the
Geneva Conventions, with which they are complying
here -- in this case the conflict is governed by Geneva
Convention 4 -- obligates the United States to move
prisoners to a safe location, and they have done that by
taking these prisoners to Camp Cropper. I have been to
Camp Cropper and I agree with the United States that
they are complying with the Geneva Conventions in that
regard.
And upon moving the Petitioners to Camp
Cropper, at that moment the case becomes functionally
litigable just as Hamdi would have been. That is, the
government will assemble its proof to defend the
detentions and present it in a district court. The only
difference is that Mr. Munaf and Mr. Omar won't appear
personally.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I really wanted to get
your answer to Justice Stevens's first question
straight. You think citizenship is not relevant?
MR. MARGULIES: Oh, no, Your Honor, I think
it's extraordinarily relevant, and I think that we
are entitled --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought you were not
basing your case on the citizenship?
MR. MARGULIES: No, Your Honor. I apologize
if I misspoke. We are basing it on citizenship --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I might have --
MR. MARGULIES: -- but it is only one of the
grounds upon which we would distinguish this case from
Hirota.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me ask you about
that, because if your basic point is that here is an
officer of the United States that has someone in
custody --
MR. MARGULIES: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- someone who is in
jeopardy, among other things, of being tortured --
MR. MARGULIES: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that United States
official has to safeguard a citizen?
MR. MARGULIES: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But can throw a
non-citizen into the lion's den? Is that the
instruction that the United States gives to its
officers, take care of our citizens, but the rest of the
world, we don't care?
MR. MARGULIES: Frankly, Your Honor, I do
not believe the United States makes that instruction to
its uniformed officers.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're making this
distinction now. Justice Kennedy asked you does -- does
your case turn on citizenship, and you said citizenship
is very important.
MR. MARGULIES: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are thousands of
noncitizens that are being held in the very same
circumstance.
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, there are
important reasons embedded in the laws of war that
authorize the United States in this context to transfer
foreign nationals back -- in this case the overwhelming
number of which are Iraqis -- back to the custody of the
Iraqi government, that the laws of war do not allow
for -- with U.S. citizens. That is a distinction.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Margulies, the prologue
to the Constitution does say "to preserve the blessings
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity." There is
something to the notion, isn't there, that the
Constitution provides constitutional rights, including
the right to the writ of habeas corpus, to Americans or
to anyone who is in America; but to say that the whole
world has rights under the Constitution is extravagant.
MR. MARGULIES: I take no position on
whether it's extravagant, Your Honor, but I certainly
take the position that that's not what we argue. And
there are grounds -- there are grounds predicated on the
laws of war, on the terms of the extradition treaty, on
the possible application of the Fifth Amendment, that
simply make differentiation between citizens and
non-citizens.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a habeas court
here has to look at all those different factors and come
to a determination of whether it has jurisdiction?
There's no bright line? It has to look at whether
hostilities have ceased or haven't ceased? It's got to
look at how far the prisoners have been removed from the
zone of hostility?
MR. GARRE: No. No, emphatically not, Your
Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what is the
bright line that determines whether there's habeas
jurisdiction or not?
MR. MARGULIES: Control. That is what
habeas turns on, Your Honor. And the bright-line test
that we propose, which is the one that has been followed
by this Court --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the control in
the middle of a zone of hostilities of a foreign
national allows -- creates habeas jurisdiction? That's
your bright line?
MR. MARGULIES: No, I'm sorry, Your Honor.
What I mean to suggest, the rule that I propose -- the
rule that I propose is that when a U.S. citizen is
detained abroad by U.S. military officials who have
effective authority and control over his continued
detention, that citizen can invoke the jurisdiction of
the United States district court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then it's not
just control. It looks to citizenship, which brings up
the questions Justice Stevens was raising.
MR. MARGULIES: Yes, Your Honor, and I
apologize. What I said at the outset is that this is a
test which turns on the jurisdictional facts that I have
identified, which is when a citizen is detained by the
U.S. military abroad and the military has effective
control.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do we have any -- any
precedent in our cases for saying that that test would
apply during an active combat in a zone of hostilities?
MR. MARGULIES: Toth v. Quarles, of course,
Your Honor, involved a person who was brought from the
United States to Korea when there was still hostilities
ongoing.
But Your Honor, again I would suggest that
what the Court will have to inquire into has been
addressed already by Hamdi, because we will not look at
the period of time --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It's a very different
place of detention.
MR. MARGULIES: Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.
But we are not focusing on the moment of capture. The
United States already has --
JUSTICE ALITO: I still don't -- I don't
understand what you're saying about citizenship. You
said earlier it wasn't necessary, and it make as big
difference. There are thousands of non-U.S. citizens
being held Iraq. Your argument with respect to your
clients is that they have -- they can file habeas
petitions in the District of Columbia and they can't be
turned over except pursuant to the extradition treaty
between the United States and Iraq; is that correct?
MR. MARGULIES: Not quite, Your Honor. Our
position is -- and I want to come back --
JUSTICE ALITO: If I could just then finish
the question. Pursuant to the extradition treaty or
some other authorization; if citizenship isn't
important, then why can't all of those thousands of
non-citizens -- or can all of those thousands of
non-citizens -- who are being held in Iraq file habeas
petitions in the District of Columbia and argue that
they can't be turned over except pursuant to the
extradition treaty or some other authorization?
MR. MARGULIES: For several reasons, Your
Honor. First of all, as the Court knows, the habeas
statute itself has been amended in a way that excludes
access for foreign nationals outside the country. The
Court -- or rather Congress, very carefully did not
exclude it for U.S. citizens. Second, there may be
limitations on whether foreign nationals can invoke the
protections of the Fifth Amendment.
Third, as I pointed out, the extradition
treaty bars the transfer of citizens, but does not bar
the transfer of non-citizens. And fourth, the laws of
war allow the United States to transfer Iraqis, but
contemplate the continued application of extradition
principles that were in place prior to the start of the
conflict.
So there are four brakes, if you will, on
the slippery slope. There is no floodgates problem in
this case. So far as we are aware --
JUSTICE BREYER: But you have only the --
the citizenship to stop the floodgate. What I'm
wondering is -- when I read the briefs, I put in my mind
a spectrum and on one side is the military occupation of
Japan, where there is basically peace but it's a
military occupation. On the other side, it's a hot war
or a guerilla war where the U.S. forces are rounding up
troops, nightly perhaps, and rounding up guerillas. And
I had put this case quite close to the military
occupation in my mind because of the nature of these
particular individuals' offense and treatment. But was
I wrong to do that? Should I assimilate this case to
either a hot war or at least a guerilla warfare, where
troops are actively engaged in rounding up those who
want to shoot them?
MR. MARGULIES: You should definitely not
assimilate this case to the latter category, Your Honor.
That is not what this case is about. And let me turn
then --
JUSTICE SOUTER: In answering that question,
would you go back, please, and clarify something that
I'm not too clear on in your answers to comparable
questions from Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens? And
that is, you say we do not claim that there would be
jurisdiction within the zone of hostilities. Is it your
point -- and you then go on to say, well, they've been
moved to this camp. Is your point the simple point that
the camp gets them out of the zone of hostilities? And
is that the reason that you answered Justice Breyer's
question by saying this is comparable to an occupation
rather than a war zone? Is that the simple point?
MR. MARGULIES: No, Your Honor. What I am
-- what I am seizing upon is the conclusion in Hamdi
that there is a zone of military discretion within which
the judiciary ought not intrude. And that has both
spatial and temporal qualities.
This is a person who has been moved from
that place, and the detention has been made, a decision
has been made to continue detention long after --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying within
what is technically a zone of hostility, there are
places, physical places, I take it, within which the
military has a degree of discretion; and that discretion
is what makes this situation comparable to an
occupation?
I mean, I'm just not following how you're
getting from A to B. That's -- that's my problem.
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, what we are
suggesting is that we recognize that there are
hostilities going on inside Iraq. But the United States
has made a decision to move the person, as required by
the Geneva Conventions, to a safe location.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So are you saying then
that the zone of hostilities does not include all of
Iraq?
otherwise?
otherwise?
MR. MARGULIES: Absolutely. That is --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So what if we thought
MR. MARGULIES: I'm sorry, Your Honor?
JUSTICE STEVENS: What if we thought
What if we thought all -- all of Iraq is a
zone of hostilities? Would we have a different result?
MR. MARGULIES: We would not, Your Honor.
We would not have a different result either
jurisdictionally or on the merits. If the United States
Government has custody and control of a United States
citizen, there is habeas jurisdiction.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then you've got to say that
there is habeas jurisdiction within the zone of
hostility. I thought you said the opposite.
MR. MARGULIES: No, Your Honor. I do say --
our position is that the habeas statute would give
jurisdiction, but there may be a period in which it
would be inappropriate, unwise, just as in Hamdi, for
the Court to intrude. And that may be --
JUSTICE SOUTER: An abstention kind of
doctrine then is what you are getting at?
MR. MARGULIES: Yes. It is abstention upon
--
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's pretty far
removed from the bright line. I mean, now you've got to
decide whether it's in the zone of hostilities or not.
You've got to decide if this is within the time period
that the Court should not exercise jurisdiction or not.
And what's going to happen, of course, is that the
district court is going to look at this and say, I can't
decide all of that right away. Let's enter an
injunction, a preliminary injunction such as at issue
here, while I decide these questions. And that's going
to have the effect of intruding quite extensively on the
exercise of executive authority.
MR. MARGULIES: I -- we think not, Your
Honor.
First of all, it does not alter in the
slightest the jurisdictional rule. The jurisdictional
rule given to us by the habeas statute is still a
bright-line rule. There may be some cases where the
petitioner is asking to -- the Court to inquire into the
lawfulness of -- the two inquiries in this case, the --
both of them governed by the Due Process Clause -- the
lawfulness of the detention for security threats, and
the lawfulness of the proposed transfer. Those are two
different inquiries. Those are the two inquiries.
There may be some instance where that
request is made fairly shortly after the decision was
made to continue to detain.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Margulies, could I ask
a few questions about the Multinational Force involved
here? Do you acknowledge that in theory, at least, the
United States in its capacity here is subject to the
control of the United Nations?
MR. MARGULIES: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You do not?
MR. MARGULIES: We do not. It is
emphatically not the case. The resolutions which bring
the Multinational Force into existence say that it will
operate under the unified command of the United States
military, which is precisely the position that the
government pressed in its brief, on page 2 of its brief.
General Casey when he testified said that the MNF is a
subordinate command to the United States military.
There is nothing in the record which suggests that the
MNF could, if it wanted to, give an order that the
United States could not countermand. There is nothing
that gives this anything other than -- and we do not --
we do not denigrate or diminish the significance of any
other country's participation. But the buck stops with
the United States Government when it comes to these
detentions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me try and move
you to the merits.
MR. MARGULIES: Please.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I had thought that
the historic purpose of the Great Writ was to challenge
custody. And it seems to me that the last thing your
clients want in this case is to be released.
MR. MARGULIES: That is incorrect, Your
Honor, and let me make it clear. There is some question
that emerged in the earlier argument on the potential
equivalence between release and transfer. So let me
address that directly.
With respect to transfer -- again that's a
separate question from detention simpliciter -- with
respect to transfer, there are two questions: The
transfer will either be lawful or it will not; Iraq will
either want him or it will not.
That obviously produces four different
possible outcomes, a matrix with four boxes. It is too
early to ascertain which of those boxes we will be in,
but let me give an illustration.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, but in the cases --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't want the
district court to say you win, you can be released
tomorrow at noon.
MR. MARGULIES: Yes, we do. In fact, Your
Honor --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought you
wanted to block the transfer. I mean, the Iraqi
authorities can pick him up at the gate.
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, let's say we
had -- my understanding of the evidence in Munaf leads
me to believe that on remand this is where we -- this is
where the state of play will go: The transfer will be
unlawful, and the Iraqi government will not want him.
Transfer unlawful. Iraqi government won't
want him. He can be released to his home --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he -- he is still
within the Iraqi criminal justice system. He wasn't --
his case wasn't dismissed. It was sent back for further
investigation.
MR. MARGULIES: Correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what's happening in
his case is he's undergoing a criminal process in Iraq;
and we are holding him during that process. So if
you're not objecting to our holding him while the
process is going on, what is -- what is he seeking
through habeas?
He -- he can't get out from under the Iraqi
criminal justice system. He is alleged to have
committed crimes within Iraq. We are holding him safe
while that process is going on. So what is the basis of
his petition?
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, his petition,
like Mr. Omar's petition, seeks his release. The only
complexity arises in one of the possible boxes; that is,
the Court concludes that the transfer is unlawful, but
there is no -- but the Iraqi government wants him. The
transfer is unlawful, but the Iraqi government wants
him.
In that situation, in order to give effect
to the legal conclusion that the transfer is unlawful --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't get up to
transfer. This man is now under investigation in the
Iraqi system.
MR. MARGULIES: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, we -- transfer isn't
an issue.
What do you want done with him while he's
subject to the criminal process in Iraq?
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, you are correct
that we do not object to the idea that, while the
district court is determining whether it is lawful to
detain a U.S. citizen in this circumstances or transfer
a U.S. citizen in those circumstances -- those two
inquiries -- it is okay to detain Mr. Munaf for the
benefit of the Iraqi government.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the relief
that was awarded by the district court also enjoined
prosecution.
MR. MARGULIES: It does not, Your Honor, and
to the extent that the D.C. Circuit in Omar interprets
that, we do not -- we disavow that. There -- as the
court pointed out, the -- first of all, they can try a
prisoner in absentia. All we object to is that -- a
physical transfer of Mr. Omar or Mr. Munaf, while the
lawfulness of that transfer is being determined. And
that is all we sought.
JUSTICE BREYER: The question is, look,
suppose the government comes in tomorrow, or in the
district court, you're back there. And the government
says you want us to release him. At noon tomorrow, we
will take him to the front gate and release him. Do you
want us to do it? Yes or no?
MR. MARGULIES: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes?
MR. MARGULIES: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want -- I'm
sorry. I just want to make sure I understand. You want
the relief in both of these cases to be, okay, we will
release him tomorrow at noon? And by the way, we're
going to notify the Iraqi authorities because we think
we're releasing a dangerous criminal and want to make
sure they have the opportunity to do whatever they want?
MR. MARGULIES: There is -- there is no
question that we do not challenge any right of
sovereignance in Iraq to share information. The only
circumstance in which it potentially arises is one in
which release has the effect of being transfer and there
is a prior determination by a United States district
court that the transfer would be unlawful. So that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why didn't you
answer Justice Breyer -- and we've interrupted you a
couple of times. You have the box. He's going to be
released. They want him. I don't see then why you
didn't answer Justice Breyer's question differently.
MR. MARGULIES: Because what I understood
the hypothetical to mean is that there had not been a
prior determination that the transfer would be unlawful.
In other words, if they just released him tomorrow --
they said, we have lost interest in him; we're releasing
him tomorrow -- there is no prior determination that the
transfer is unlawful.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what we're doing --
MR. MARGULIES: So you're not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What we're doing is we're
testing the authority and the propriety of the district
judge to proceed.
MR. MARGULIES: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's why we are
asking if, at the end of the day, the order is a
release, is there a problem? And I should think you'd
yes.
MR. MARGULIES: No. Your Honor, if the
conclusion is that the transfer would be unlawful, then
you cannot release him in a way that effects the
transfer.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Who says? I mean, a
transfer is one thing and saying you're free to go and
the Iraqi government picks him up is something else.
Why -- why do you equate the two?
MR. MARGULIES: Because, Your Honor, we
think that the district court can order, under 28 U.S.C.
2243, as law and justice requires, a release -- or
rather, relief that gives effect to the contours of the
right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- of course it can.
MR. MARGULIES: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It can, but --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that you're
begging -- you're begging a question -- you're inserting
a premise that we have to decide, whether the release is
unlawful. We're asking, that's part of the equation.
I'm the district judge. Can I say, I've looked at all
this, I want this prisoner released tomorrow morning;
and if the Iraqis pick him up, fine with me? Can I say
that?
MR. MARGULIES: Yes, you can.
But if there is a determination that the
transfer would be unlawful, then you need to release the
person in a manner -- for instance, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let's get to
that. What manner? Tell me exactly what should such an
order would look like.
MR. MARGULIES: It -- we would ask the
district court to order precisely what the military
already does, which is to remove a person to a safe
place. When United States citizens are released from
Camp Cropper, they are brought from --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So Releasing at place A,
not place B.
MR. MARGULIES: That's correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Don't push him out the
gates; take him somewhere else, and then release him.
That's the order?
MR. MARGULIES: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And don't tell --
MR. MARGULIES: That's the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And don't tell the
Iraqis where that's going to be?
MR. MARGULIES: They don't do that now, Your
Honor. When -- when United States citizens are released
from Iraq, what they do is they put them in a car out of
Camp Cropper, the same thing when I left Camp Cropper.
They put them in a car from Camp Cropper. They drive
them to the American --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's within
the executive's discretion. I want to know if you are
saying that the district court in this case can require
the custodian not simply to release the person, but to
release them somewhere else and to keep the point at
which they're going to release someone whose been
determined by the MNF-I tribunal to be a dangerous
criminal, to keep the point of his release secret from
the Iraqi government.
MR. MARGULIES: If the determination has
already been made that the transfer would be unlawful,
yes, we think that in law and equity they can do that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Now the
determination that the transfer would be unlawful, I --
again, I get back -- maybe I'm repeating myself. I have
always understood habeas to be concerned with custody,
rather than this broad range of determinations about
what's lawful and unlawful, other than as are necessary
to rule on the question of custody.
In other words, of course, if there's been a
Fourth Amendment violation, you bring a habeas action,
you determine whether the custody is lawful or not.
Here you want a determination whether the transfer is
unlawful or not.
MR. MARGULIES: Yes. Because the United
States Government simply lacks the power under the Due
Process Clause to surrender a citizen to the custody of
another sovereign. That -- it just lacks that power.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Whether it does or
does not, I just question whether habeas is an
appropriate remedy in that situation, again because it's
not concerned with the legality of transfer; it's
concerned with the legality of custody.
MR. MARGULIES: Habeas has long been used to
test the lawfulness, under the Fifth Amendment, of a
proposed transfer.
JUSTICE STEVENS: How can you say that the
United States lacks the power to transfer? Suppose this
fellow had been arrested in the street by a sergeant in
the Army and he says, what will I do with him? I'll
take him to the Iraqis and turn him over. Would that be
an illegal transfer?
MR. MARGULIES: It -- once the United States
has the authority to --
JUSTICE STEVENS: A sergeant caught this
guy, and he wants to turn him over to the Iraqis. Does
he -- is there some law that prevents him from doing
that?
MR. MARGULIES: It may be the Constitution
and the habeas statute could combine to prevent that.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That applies to the
sergeant in the city of --
MR. MARGULIES: As I said before, Your
Honor -- as I tried to say, and I apologize if I'm not
being clear -- there is a zone of military discretion
where it may not be appropriate --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't all of this
within the zone of military discretion?
MR. MARGULIES: Because we filed this
application more than a year after the United States
made a decision to continue the detention. Think about
it this way, Your Honor: If Hamdi -- exact same facts
-- had simply been kept in Afghanistan, instead of
brought to Charleston, South Carolina, we think there
still would have habeas jurisdiction. The court would
have undertaken the exact same inquiry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you had filed
it -- if you had filed it six months rather than a year
after, would there be habeas jurisdiction.
MR. MARGULIES: We think in six months, yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You see where I'm
going. Three months?
MR. MARGULIES: There may be some cases that
become difficult, Your Honor. In this case, for
instance --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The bright line is
getting awfully fuzzy, as far as I'm concerned.
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, in this case --
in both cases, after two months they made the
determination to continue to hold them in the MNF-I
tribunals. So at the very least, at that point we're
covered.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me your
statement is wildly overbroad: That there is a
due-process restriction on release by the United States
Government to another sovereign?
MR. MARGULIES: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we have an undercover
agent in Japan who finds a drug dealer, he gives him to
the Japanese police.
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand that.
That's a sweeping statement. That just can't be right.
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, with all due
respect, it has been the law for over a century in this
country. It ordinarily arises in the classic
extradition context. But even when a person is already
overseas and the United States wants to transfer them to
the custody of another sovereign --
JUSTICE STEVENS: You're talking about a
transfer in what I assume you said was a zone of
hostilities.
MR. MARGULIES: I'm sorry, Your Honor?
JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you were talking
about a transfer in an area that you say was engaged in
active hostilities.
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, we --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that affect the
decision at all?
MR. MARGULIES: It does not affect a
citizen's due-process entitlement. In the metes and
bounds, the way we would analyze it under Matthews
versus Aldridge, it may affect what inquiry the
government has to make in order to justify it. But it
does not affect the citizen's right, the citizen's
constitutional entitlement, to challenge the lawfulness
of a transfer at the hands of his government to another
sovereign.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you've just said that
it's unlawful. You said that an American law
enforcement officer working in another country who takes
custody of a wanted criminal cannot turn him over to the
government of that country. That's just got to be
wrong.
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, just to finish
the answer, the transfer may take place, but it may only
take place as authorized by law. That is, they have to
show a legal and factual basis. The legal basis is they
have to show a treaty or a statutory authority; and the
factual basis is they have to show that the person comes
within it.
So, of course, they can pass a person.
Those -- those transfers take place all the time, but it
must take place consistent with the requirements of the
law.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Margulies, let
me make sure there are no other questions.
JUSTICE BREYER: You need all that to win
this case. That is, as I started the case I thought
this involved an American being held by the military for
over a year pending the resolution of criminal charges
in Iraq, which are charges of kidnapping in respect to
which whatever hot war is going on over there has very
little to do with his being held.
MR. MARGULIES: Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you've been arguing
for all sorts of things that seem far broader than that.
So I'd like to focus you for a second on that matter.
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, we -- all of
these other matters we do not need in order to prevail.
The district court, examining two claims under the
due-process clause, will examine whether there is legal
authority to detain a person, to detain these prisoners
as security internees or security threats. That is a
classic Hamdi inquiry. And they will examine under the
due-process clause whether it is lawful to transfer
them.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why do you say it has
nothing to do with the war, then? They are holding them
as security detainees. Aren't they -- aren't they
worried that if they just let them go, they'll go right
back to killing Americans and Iraqis?
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, this is what
came up in Hamdi. In Hamdi, you had a conflict, boots
on the ground. They captured a United States citizen in
a battlefield situation. And this Court made a
decision, made a determination, that that person can
challenge the lawfulness of his -- of his detention.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not arguing that. I'm
just questioning your statement that it's irrelevant
that this is occurring in a war zone. It is not at all
irrelevant.
One of the -- the reason they're being
detained is precisely because this is a war zone.
MR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, we think that
point is answered by the suggestion in Hamdi that you
don't want to create a perverse incentive to keep people
there. They have made a decision to keep them there.
The inquiry that the district court will undertake is
the same in Hamdi as in this case. There is nothing
that -- there is nothing about that inquiry that is
altered by the United States' determination to move them
to a safe --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: One distinct difference
in Munaf's case: He is undergoing a criminal process in
Iraq, and Omar has also -- it is alleged that he has
committed offenses in Iraq.
Has no prosecution, no investigation been
started with respect to Omar?
MR. MARGULIES: That is correct, Your Honor.
What the district court did in its preliminary
injunction, the Rosetta Stone of the preliminary
injunction appears on page 143 of the joint appendix.
And there you have an e-mail from the United
States Government, from opposing counsel to us,
indicating to us on February 2, 2006, that a decision
had been made to refer Mr. Omar to proceedings in the
CCCI, but telling us in the second-to-the-last sentence
of that page that we would not receive notice of when
that referral took place.
And it pointedly -- they did not say that
Mr. Omar would remain in U.S. custody once the referral
took place.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Margulies.
MR. MARGULIES: Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Garre, seven
minutes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Garre, would you
address this question at some point? Assuming -- assume
an officer in the national government arrests somebody
unlawfully in Portland, Oregon, and transfers the person
across the country to Portland, Maine. The person files
for habeas in the district court in Maine, and the
district court says: Yes, you are right. You are being
held unlawfully.
Does the court have the authority to tell
the United States to take him back to Portland, Oregon,
and then release him?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY GARRE
ON BEHALF OF PETE GEREN,
SECRETARY OF THE ARMY, ET AL.
MR. GARRE: I think this court confronted a
similar situation in the Padilla case a couple of years
ago. And what it -- it -- there was a habeas petition
filed in New York, and it -- the court held that that
habeas petition was improperly filed and a different
petition should be filed in South Carolina.
And it didn't get into the question of the
transfer. And we certainly -- we don't think that
transfer --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you have a position on
the answer to my question?
MR. GARRE: Whether the habeas court could
direct that he be brought back to Portland?
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
MR. GARRE: I think the habeas court would
--
JUSTICE SOUTER: The habeas court says,
look, it is not complete relief just to put him out on
the street in Portland -- in Maine. He's broke, and
he's 3,000 miles from home. Take him back to Portland,
Oregon.
Does the habeas court have the authority to
do that?
MR. GARRE: I would say probably not,
Justice Souter. I mean there are transfers all the time
where habeas petitions are filed, and people are going
from State authority to Federal authority. And the rule
--
is that those transfers, of course, can take place. The
habeas proceedings can continue. The habeas has
traditionally been used to block transfers.
Here -- and I think it is important to focus
on the injunction that the court of appeals sustained.
It is an injunction against allowing the Iraqi
prosecutions to proceed because the court enjoined
American officials from presenting Mr. Omar to the Iraqi
courts. Now, Mr. Margulies said that they didn't enjoin
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't see that in the
junction, itself. It just -- the injunction was very
spare.
MR. GARRE: What the injunction says -- and
it is on page 59a -- is that it bars -- of the petition
appendix in the Omar petition, the gray petition, and I
am quoting now: "Shall not remove the Petitioner from
the United States or MNF-I custody, or take any other
action inconsistent with this court's memorandum
opinion."
"Any other action inconsistent with this
court's memorandum opinion" is allowing the prosecution
to proceed, and the Court of Appeals makes this express
on page 25a of the petition appendix where the Court of
Appeals majority says, quote, "we agree with the dissent
that the injunction prohibits the military from
presenting Omar to the CCCI for trial."
Now, Mr. Margulies said that the proceedings
can go forward just without his client's presence,
but that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If one could go agree --
let's say one could agree that was overbroad. Does that
mean that the whole injunction falls? Let's say, take
two pieces out of it: No information sharing; that's
beyond the pale. And you can't make an order that a
foreign court shouldn't hear a case. Take those two
out.
MR. GARRE: That would be a vast improvement
over the injunction that was held by the court of
appeals.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how about the rest of
it?
MR. GARRE: And then you are dealt -- you
are left with the transfer, the injunction on the
transfer to the Iraqi authorities in the event that
Mr. Omar is convicted.
And on that, I confess to being not -- not
being entirely clear as to what my friend's position is.
He says that we can release him because, of course, that
is the office of the Writ of Habeas Corpus.
But then he goes on to say: But we can't
release him in a way that would affect a transfer. I'm
not sure what that means because I thought he also
said that we --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I think it means the
same thing that the point of my question was.
He is saying you can't release him at point
A, which would be tantamount to transfer; you've got to
take him to point B, somewhere where his release will
not result in the automatic arrest. And that's why I
asked my question.
MR. GARRE: Just to underscore the affront
to the Iraqi sovereignty on this, his clients
acknowledge that they can be arrested by Iraqi officials
for crimes they allegedly committed in Iraq if they were
released. But the injunction that they're asking this
Court to sustain is an injunction that prevents the
Multi-National Force in Iraq from telling Iraqi
authorities: We are going to release these Petitioners
at 12:00 o'clock tomorrow. In effect, they're asking
for an eight-hour head start so that these individuals
whom the Multi-National Force has determined pose
threats to the security of Iraq, who Iraq has determined
pose threats to the security of Iraq, that an American
court is enjoining the Multi-National Force from
conveying that information to the Iraqi authorities so
that these individuals who went to Iraq voluntarily can
be held to account in he Iraqi system for crimes that
they committed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think an eight-hour
lead is enough? I don't know.
MR. GARRE: Well, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It would make a good movie.
MR. GARRE: Yes.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we have a basic
question: Is there habeas jurisdiction; and, as I
understand the posture of this case, the Federal courts
did not examine the merits of the habeas petition. They
were just hung up on the bare jurisdictional question.
MR. GARRE: That's true. But we think that
it is quite clear from this Court's decisions that if
they don't have the authority to enter the preliminary
injunctive relief that they did at the end of the day
they have no authority to enter it as a preliminary
matter.
I think on the jurisdictional point, the one
point I wanted to stress is that if this Court does find
jurisdiction we think it has to be because of a reading
of the habeas statute informed by the Constitution
that's limited to citizens. Extending jurisdiction to
everyone in Iraq would be an extraordinary expansion of
this Court's decision in Rasul. Just to be clear, Camp
Cropper in Iraq bears none of the characteristics of the
Guantanamo Bay that this Court discussed in its opinion
in Rasul and that Justice Kennedy emphasized in his
concurrence. So any jurisdictional ruling by this
Court, we would urge it to rule only to the
circumstances here of the fact of citizenship.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The the 20,000-plus
people being retained, are they all in connection with
security threats? Or do they involve what I guess we
could call common criminals?
MR. GARRE: I think there are both. This
have been 2,000 transfers of individuals from
Multinational Force to Iraqi custody, most in connection
with criminal proceedings. The other individuals are
held because they're a security threat. A lot of
individuals come in and out of detention.
Obviously the Multinational Force tries to
limit the detentions as much as possible. Here the
reason why these people have been subsidy contained so
long is because the American courts have stood in the
way of the Iraqi criminal proceedings where the Iraqi
courts have sought to bring justice to these people
under Iraqi law.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Garre, is it the
position of the government that this is a war zone?
MR. GARRE: It's -- we don't take the
position this is like a battlefield situation. The
occupation --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think any part of
Iraq is like a battlefield situation?
MR. GARRE: Certainly there are active
hostilities in parts of Iraq.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't it a war zone?
MR. GARRE: Well, the occupation has ended.
I think there are active hostilities in part of it. We
have not argued that there is no habeas jurisdiction
because of the hostilities there. We've argued that
there is no habeas jurisdiction because they're being
held under --
JUSTICE STEVENS: That means you haven't
made your strongest argument.
MR. GARRE: Well, if the Court believes that
that's our strongest argument, certainly we don't have
any objection to having you address it.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: But am I right to assume
the underlying situation to be that of Hirota?
MR. GARRE: That's jurisdictional.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but you see what I
mean by that? I mean, these issues of the war zone and
so forth are not really there in this case; that we're
talking here about a person whose being held in a manner
that's comparable for habeas purposes to the Japanese or
aliens who were held in Hirota. They're being held by
the Army, which is in part, which is in relevant part
serving as an occupying force, to be turned over to a
different tribunal.
MR. GARRE: That's correct, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Garre.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:23 a.m., the case in the
