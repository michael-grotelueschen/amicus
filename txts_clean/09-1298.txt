CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

United States, and the consolidated case, 09-1302, the
Boeing Company v. United States.
Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The proposition that Petitioners are here
challenging is the one adopted or embraced by the
Federal Circuit that says that the United States
Government can declare that certain of its government
contracting partners have operated in default and, under
those circumstances, can reach into the government
contractor's pocket, withdraw at the time $1.35 billion
of moneys that were spent by the United States, but for
services that were rendered, without question, pursuant
to the contract, pursuant to the instructions of the
United States Government, and that when the contractor
seeks to defend against the claim that it has engaged in
some kind of default conduct, that the government can
assert the state-secrets privilege and, in so doing,
deprive the contractor of the ability effectively to
respond to the government's conclusion.
Under those circumstances, it seems to me
that the statement in this Court's decision in United
States v. Reynolds, which is that the government is
certainly free to assert the state-secrets privilege,
but when it does so, it has to assume certain
responsibilities that come from it, at least in the
circumstances where the United States is the moving
party.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, when the
contractors -- when they failed to deliver the first
aircraft at the time specified by the contract, their
reason was that its costs would far outrun the contract
price, and so it sought to reformulate the contract.
At that time -- correct me if I'm wrong, but
I think at that time the contractors said nothing at all
about superior knowledge and the government's obligation
to share information that it hadn't shared.
MR. PHILLIPS: There was nothing specific
with respect to that, Justice Ginsburg. The first time
the contractors identified the superior knowledge
problem arose, obviously, when the government took the
extraordinary step of issuing a cure notice, because up
until that point, obviously, the parties are attempting
to negotiate and work to a final resolution of this
project, as you would hope any contracting entities
would, to bring the contract to a happy resolution,
so --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would expect them
to say, if they -- if that was the impediment to going
forward on this contract, to at least mention it. And
to --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, yes, I think you have
to put it in context, Justice Ginsburg, because during
this period of time, obviously, there were consistent
efforts and requests being made to get access to both
the B-2 and the A-117 stealth technologies, and there
were discussions that went back and forth, and the
district court -- or the Court of Federal Claims
specifically held -- eventually, the information was
forthcoming, but it was, candidly, too little and too
late in order to effectively allow the contract to
proceed as -- as planned.
So I think -- I mean, I agree, you know, in
a perfect world, maybe you would have identified this.
But in this situation, the parties are simply trying to
come to some kind of a resolution that allows both sides
to be satisfied by the final --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- disposition.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- why wasn't the need
to share that technology a part of this contract or a
condition to the contract? I've gone through the
contract -- or, not all of it; enough of it. I haven't
found anywhere in the contract that it requires the U.S.
to share information with you. Does that have anything
to do with what due process would require? Meaning --
MR. PHILLIPS: No, I think -- I think,
Justice --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I --
MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm going to pose a
hypothetical. Let's assume the contract required the
sharing of state secrets, and the government then
invokes its privilege. Is that a different case than
this one in terms of due process? Wouldn't the --
wouldn't the former situation, where it's been made a
condition of the contract, require a different treatment
than this situation where the government's just saying,
if you want to raise a defense that's not part of the
contract, then you do what every other litigant with a
privilege does -- who a privilege has been invoked
against; you proceed with whatever evidence you have.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you have to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's usually what
happens with other privileges.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And we would have
been perfectly content to proceed with the evidence we
had. But the ultimate decision by the Court of Federal
Claims was that it was impossible to ultimately be in a
position to resolve it.
But I want to answer your more fundamental
question, Your Honor, as to the -- you know, the basic
point is, is that the background principle of law, the
superior knowledge defense, is the understanding of the
parties when they enter into an agreement. I mean, that
would have been true just as much in the Helene Curtis
case and the other cases where the Federal Circuit has
acknowledged the superior knowledge defense. That's
been around for a long time. It's a-- it's an
understood basis on which the parties enter into an
agreement. That's the first answer.
The second answer is that you're asking us
to put into a contract something about information that
we don't know anything about. We -- I mean, we have
some sense about the B-2 and the A-117, but we don't
know anything about the other programs that are
identified here.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. Where's
the obligation of the government to tell you build it
this way using the technology we already have? I
thought your claim was that you were promised this
information, and you structured the contract based on
that promise.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, our claim -- we have
separate -- we have a series of distinct claims.
Our first claim is that we never would have
entered into the contract in the first place if the
government had provided us with information based on its
superior knowledge that the -- for instance, the weight
specifics that we were being asked to provide or to
supply were literally impossible to comply with based on
what the government already knew. If we had been just
told that much, just given a warning, we wouldn't be in
the situation where we are here --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's a factual
dispute about that. I think somewhere I read that there
is a claim that they told you your weight estimates
weren't right.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well -- I mean, that may be a
factual dispute, but I'd be -- and I'd be happy to
litigate that issue if -- if we can get to that point
where we're in fact allowed to litigate any aspects of
our particular defense. But the bottom line here is --
and again to state the proposition as starkly as it --
as it is, because this is the way it comes to the Court
from the Federal Circuit: They're saying that the
government can assert a claim for $1.35 billion dollars
against us and tell us that we cannot defend against
that claim even though the reason why we were unable to
comply with the contract is because of the fact that the
government didn't provide us information either at the
outset or as we went along.
JUSTICE BREYER: The two questions I'd have
is, first of all -- Justice Sotomayor, sorry; I did not
-- I did have her question, because what that suggests
is, in this case, it's not unfair to hold your client in
this case. And you just read the two circuit court
opinions here, and you think this is a defense coming
out of long in the past that doesn't have much substance
to it. That was her question, I think, as I understood
MR. PHILLIPS: Can I answer --
JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, it's not
unfair. But let me give you the other question because,
sometime in your argument, I'd like you to get to that.
And that is, if we accept as a principle of law what was
said in Reynolds, a criminal case or whatever, and apply
it to government contracting, where sophisticated
contractors are perfectly capable of negotiating their
own contract, we are not just throwing a monkey wrench
into the gears of government contracting; we're throwing
the whole monkey. That's my second question.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't --
JUSTICE BREYER: One, that this isn't a case
that calls for it; and, two, the threat to government
contracting by changing from Reynolds to here is
overwhelming. Now, I'd like your views on both of
those.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, it seems to me
clearly that this is the precise situation where
Reynolds is saying if you cannot bring forward a
legitimate defense -- I mean, part of the problem is we
don't know precisely what information we didn't have and
were never entitled to. So it's very difficult to say
how strong is our defense under these circumstances.
What we do know is that the Court of Federal
Claims judge looked very carefully at this and said that
we had made an impressive showing without regard to any
of the confidential or privileged information of a prima
facie defense in these circumstances. So our position
is we had a very valid defense. This is not pretextual.
We're not throwing this in simply as a mechanism to
force the government to assert its state secrets. It's
a fairly contrived approach to litigation and, frankly,
not something that I could imagine any circumstance in
which we would do that.
Two, I don't see how this throws a monkey
wrench into this process whatsoever, much less throws
out the monkey, because -- because the basic
understanding here is that the government is not
entitled to force its contractor down along this course.
If the government has information available to it, then
it has to make that information -- has to be forthcoming
with the information with the contractor, either at the
outset, which would have been the best of all
circumstances here, or as matters go along.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the Petitioners as a
formal matter were the moving party; isn't that right?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, not -- I mean, "moving
party" I think is -- is not a self-defined concept,
Justice Alito. The Petitioners are the plaintiffs.
JUSTICE ALITO: They were the plaintiffs.
And the review scheme that you outlined was known to
them beforehand. So why do we need to look beyond that?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because the review
scheme also says that the very -- in 1986, in the
Assurance case, the Federal Circuit said -- which was
before this contract was entered into, the Federal
Circuit said the filing -- the mere filing of a
complaint immediately vacates the contracting officer's
rule.
So our understanding at the time we entered
into this agreement is that if there were a problem with
the way the contracting officer operated, we would be
allowed to file a claim and immediately take the
contracting officer's rule off the table. Under those
circumstances, it seems to me all we're asking for is to
go back to the status quo ante in that situation, which
means there's no contracting officer decision, there's
no basis on which the government can make a claim for
.35 billion, now $3 billion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain that --
you've referred to it several times now. I thought that
that was not a progress payment based on completed work.
The government says that that money was advanced; you
had not complied with what was necessary to comply with
to get that 1.35 million. They distinguished the $1.35
million that you legitimately received as a progress
payment, but this next, they say, you have not fulfilled
what you needed to do to get that.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, what had not happened
is that the final -- there had not been a final sign-off
by the contracting officer approving it and thereby
reducing it to a liquidated claim. But that's a vastly
different statement than to say -- and, indeed, we have
an argument that, at least with respect to half of that,
that it had already effectively been approved through a
mechanism independent of the contracting officer.
But the bottom line here is these were
services rendered, actually rendered. This was not some
kind of a prepayment for services to be rendered in the
future. That's not the nature of this contract. These
were -- this was for work we had done, for which we had
submitted specific claims, and for which the contracting
officer had pending before him at the time. And so, you
know, what the government says is that -- is that it was
a payment and they didn't ultimately get the airplanes
that were the ultimate desire of the contract under
these circumstances, and that's obviously true because
they terminated the contract a year before the airplanes
were due to be provided to them.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are here seeking
to -- to emerge as a total winner, that is to get from
this contract what you would have gotten if it had been
successfully completed, including any profit --
MR. PHILLIPS: No. No, Justice Ginsburg,
that's not true. All we are asking for is -- are the
remedies that are fully available if you were to convert
this from a termination for default into a termination
for convenience. And under those circumstances, what --
you know, that -- the government has a wonderful
mechanism there. It protects it against the kinds of
lost profits damages that might otherwise be available
in a situation where you have a more traditional breach
of contract.
So all we're -- all we're asking for is the
actual amount of money that we expended, that the --
frankly, the Court of Federal Claims explicitly found,
and at this stage it's unchallenged, although presumably
it might be litigable at some point, but that these were
all reasonable, allowable, and fairly allocable costs to
these -- to this particular contract.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why shouldn't we view
this as if it were a dispute between two private
contracting parties? And if we did that, perhaps one
party would be the moving party with respect to some of
the claims and the other party would be the moving party
with respect to the remaining claims.
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Alito, I think that
is precisely how you ought to look at it, and -- and
we'd be very comfortable with that, because it's quite
clear to me that, except in the hyper-technical way
that -- that you articulate because of -- because of the
way the Contracts Disputes Act plays out, that the
government is unquestionably the moving party, the party
seeking affirmative relief to be able to take 1.35
billion --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I would -- I think it's
questionable, Mr. Phillips, for this reason: You say
that it's an implied term of this contract that the
government has a duty to share certain information, and
you are seeking to enforce that implied term of the
contract. So it seems to me, as to that alleged duty,
you are the moving party. You're saying: Court, please
enforce this implied term of the contract.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, not -- I mean, you
could -- that's one way to articulate it. I think the
other way to articulate it, which -- which is much more
consistent with the reality of what's going on here, is
that the government is making a claim for $1.35 billion
for which -- on the basis that we did not act in a
timely fashion. And that's the only basis that exists
in this litigation anymore, is just the time of the
actions that we took.
And our answer to that claim is to say: No,
we -- we are not at fault for the delays because you did
not provide us the information or you did not spare us
the burden of having to go down this path in the first
instance.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but then you go on to
say: Moreover, give us -- give us the payment for the
additional money beyond the 1.35 that you've already
given us --
MR. PHILLIPS: But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- plus this additional
money that we've expended.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But that just goes to
Justice Alito's question about is there some way to
evaluate those claims separately, and the answer is,
yes, they should be evaluated separately. And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why shouldn't we?
mean, it -- it seems to me if -- if, indeed, you say the
government has come up with a defense that makes it
impossible to decide who's in the right here --
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- why don't we just -- you
know, I think the usual course taken by courts would be
to leave the parties where they are. The matter can't
be litigated. That would mean you would keep your $1.35
billion, but you wouldn't be entitled to sue for the
additional amount. If -- if you were that worried, you
should have -- you -- you should have had more frequent
progress payments or something.
Why don't we just leave you where you are,
both you and the government, assuming we agree with you
on all the rest?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, to be sure, we
would be much more comfortable in the world you just
articulated, Justice Scalia, than we are in the Federal
Circuit.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you would be 1.35
billion --
(Laughter.)
MR. PHILLIPS: With interest.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: With interest. I forgot
the interest.
MR. PHILLIPS: That's starting to add up,
Your Honor.
(Laughter.)
MR. PHILLIPS: But -- and -- certainly we
think that's -- that is the minimum that we should be
entitled to, and maybe to some extent you could say
we're sort of being a little greedy. But the -- the
reality is that the standard rule is that if you take a
contract and you say you cannot make a determination
that the contractor has been guilty of default, then
that contract should be, in the -- kind of the basic
contract law and it's also in this -- in this agreement,
that you -- you convert it to a termination for
convenience.
And then the question simply is, what rights
flow from having declared this to be a termination for
convenience?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned the 1.3 --
that you get to keep the 1.35 million, but there was
also another figure -- 1.2 million that you would get on
top of that.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And that -- that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that certainly
wouldn't be leaving you where you were.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. I mean, actually,
what -- what the $1.2 billion was, was the additional
amounts of money that were actually expended by the
contractors that were reasonable, allocable, and
allowable, by and according to the Court of Federal
Claims, on this agreement. So, there -- and it would be
the standard operating procedure. If you have a
termination for convenience, where the government says,
look, we've decided we just don't want to have this --
these -- we don't want these airplanes anymore, so let's
just call it off, which the government has the right to
do, then the question is, what are the reasonable costs
that are, you know, sort of reallocated as a consequence
of that? And the Court of Federal Claims --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the government didn't
do that. I mean, you're making it up. The government
didn't terminate for convenience. The government
claimed you're in default. Why would -- why should we
force that down the government's throat when we can no
more say that the government's wrong than we can say
that you're wrong?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it seems to me the -- I
mean, the question is was the default --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you call the
game off.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, and the question is, if
you call the game off, what -- what flows from that?
And it seems to me that it -- you can say we'll let the
government call it a default, I suppose, or you could
just as easily say -- and obviously the position we
would take is you say the government cannot call it a
default because, in order to get some kind of a
determination along those lines, somebody is going to
have to make a judgment that's not an honest assessment
of the -- of the -- of the facts of this case.
And so, if you say it's not a default
termination, then there's just a certain amount of --
certain consequences that flow from converting it, and
it automatically converts at that point to a termination
for convenience. And in a termination for convenience
situation, then you reallocate the costs in precisely
the way that the Court of Federal Claims has done this
at this point.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the fallacy is we're
not -- assuming we agree with you on the rest, we're not
saying that it's not a default termination. We're
saying we don't know.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And the question
is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We're saying we don't know.
We don't know what the state-secrets thing is. The
government is entitled to -- to make that determination,
so we don't know who's in the right here.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I -- the
problem --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So why force the government
to -- to go to a termination for convenience?
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, I would think
that the -- that the more appropriate way to proceed
under those circumstances, given that a default
termination carries with it a lot of collateral
consequences, it exposes you to subsequent problems in
the contracting context, it creates the possibility of
debarment in -- in future proceedings, that rather than
allow a finding that no one can comfortably conclude is
the right finding to stay in place and have those
collateral consequences flow from it, the more
appropriate way to proceed would be to say: Look, I
can't make a determination in this case that there
should be a termination for default.
And under those -- and so, therefore, the --
the -- under the contract, under the government
contracting principles generally, it automatically
converts over to a termination for convenience. And
once that happens, then you go down the road of -- of
evaluating those costs. And, again, the government's
got arguments about those costs, I'm sure, and we can --
and we can debate those out, although, you know, I would
commend the Court to the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips, give us a
way, a reasoned way, to reach the result Justice Scalia
is suggesting, because you are being greedy. You
admitted it. The termination --
MR. PHILLIPS: No, I -- I said --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The termination for --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- I could be characterized
that way.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A termination for
convenience carries its own automatic consequences that
appear unfair in light of the fact that the litigation
of the default termination has been invoked because
there is a risk to the United States. So, is there a
reasoned way to do it --
MR. PHILLIPS: Now, are you --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to not -- to not
impose that unfairness on the government? And if
there's not, then explain to me why it's unfair, given
that you're two sophisticated contracting parties, to
say you entered a contract knowing the government could
invoke state secrets, it has, and so you bear the risk
of that. I mean, you always knew the government could
do this.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but -- well, I don't
know whether you want me to answer the second part
first --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It goes back to my
original question, is --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- or go back to the original
question.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you could have
contracted around it.
MR. PHILLIPS: Sure, and so could the
government. I mean, the reality is that the background
principle here is United States v. Reynolds. And United
States v. Reynolds says that if somebody is the moving
party, that is the party seeking affirmative relief,
that's the party who's going to bear the burden to --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, could I ask
you whether that principle makes any sense in this
contracting situation, because both parties have argued
it as though the question of who is the moving party is
determinative of this case, but in a contract situation
the question of who's the moving party is very often
arbitrary or fortuitous.
If you think about it in a private setting,
you have one contract -- one contractor who fails to
perform or -- or provides some deficient product,
another who decides it's not going to pay, and the
question of who the plaintiff is, is often just a matter
of fortuity, who gets to the courthouse first --
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- what the payment schedule
has been like, so whether somebody is demanding their
money back or simply refusing to pay it at all.
So, why in this contract situation is the
question of who's the plaintiff or who's the moving
party -- why does -- why does that make such a
difference?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I think that
actually the Court in Reynolds, to the extent it would
have envisioned any of these circumstances decades ago,
used the language "moving party" rather than "plaintiff"
or "defendant" precisely for that reason, because I
think what the Court had in mind is the party who was
seeking affirmative relief. And --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was thinking of a
tort. It wasn't thinking of -- Reynolds is a tort
action.
MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, no. To be sure, that --
that's the specific context, although the Court's
language is broader than that. It just didn't talk
about itself as a defendant in a tort action.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But it can't possibly be the
case that the question is what the payment schedule is.
If I've paid you already and then I find your product
deficient, then I'm going to go to court and demand my
money back. If I find your product deficient before I
pay you, then you're going to go to court and say you
have to pay me.
So why should that difference make a
difference with respect to the constitutional question
before us?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because in the one
situation I have $1.35 billion in my pocket for services
that were unquestionably rendered and which, in our
judgment, you know, satisfied our portion of the
obligation under this contract.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Both party has a claim here.
One says you provided deficient performance; the other
says you were obligated to pay me. The question of who
has the claim and who has the affirmative defense -- it
can be structured in either way.
MR. PHILLIPS: I don't disagree with that,
Justice Kagan. I think the bottom line, though, is, you
know, what -- what -- what are -- what do principles of
fundamental fairness tell you to do in this case?
JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly my problem,
because when I looked at Reynolds, Reynolds doesn't hold
anything in your favor. It holds the opposite way. It
says to you -- in a criminal case, we said it was
unconscionable for the government both to prosecute and
not to -- not to tell them a secret, okay? And it says
such a rationale has no application in a civil forum
where the government is not the moving party. It
doesn't say anything about where the government is the
moving party.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but --
JUSTICE BREYER: And Exhibit A that it is
not unconscionable here consists of the two opinions of
the Federal Circuit. I mean -- now, what do you want me
to read to get over that impression?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, the very fact
that the court says and limits its ruling to where the
government is not the moving party -- I mean, if the
government really -- if the court --
JUSTICE BREYER: It didn't limit it. It
said the rationale is unconscionable. Now, I don't even
have to go that far. I can go to "fundamentally
unfair." All I want to know is what should I read to
get over my unfortunate impression, which I got out of
the two opinions that I did read, that there was nothing
unfair? Okay?
What do you want me to read to get over that
impression --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- which I think you do
want me to read something.
MR. PHILLIPS: I think -- right. Well, no,
you should clearly read the Court of Federal Claims
opinion that gave rise to this in the first place, where
-- where the judge says we have made --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MR. PHILLIPS: -- an impressive prima facie
showing of a defense. And -- and the Federal Circuit's
view is: We don't care; we're not going to let you go
down that path, period.
And all we're saying is that in that
situation, where we've made that kind of showing, the
default rule should be the government cannot reach into
our pocket and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just before we get
there, that showing was based on the court's in camera
review of quite a bit of already confidential
information, correct?
MR. PHILLIPS: And the non-privileged
information that it had available to it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the non-privileged
information. So it made this judgment on the basis of a
great deal of information, and yet it couldn't conclude
that you were right as a matter of law, correct?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it recognized that it
terminated the discovery early. And, actually, it did
-- it terminated discovery very early, and -- and there
are whole programs that we know nothing about. We know
about the B-2 and the A-15. What we don't know are the
other programs, and there's nothing in this record on
any of that, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Phillips.
General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL KUMAR KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
GENERAL KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
Two basic things decide this case. First,
the government is not affirmatively invoking the power
of the Federal court; only the plaintiffs are. It was
Mr. Phillips's clients who 20 years ago walked into the
Federal court and asked that court to set aside the
decision of the contracting officer and to award them
over a billion dollars in damages. The government, by
contrast, simply asked the court to dismiss the Federal
lawsuit.
And, second, Reynolds makes clear that the
state-secrets privilege will be used to bar a claim at
most only when the party that is relying on secret
information is trying to use the Federal court to alter
the legal status quo. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have -- we've
gotten to this point in the dispute because you say
they're at fault; they say you're at fault. Under the
state-secrets doctrine, we can't resolve that question.
Why don't we call the whole thing off? Nobody's at
fault; that means it's terminated not for fault, but for
convenience, and that's it.
GENERAL KATYAL: Well, for several reasons.
One is that is the affirmative use of the Federal courts
to alter the legal status quo. I think the principle of
Reynolds is that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, only because
you altered the legal status quo -- the legal status quo
is they're going along with their contract, and you
altered it by holding them in default.
GENERAL KATYAL: I disagree, Mr. Chief
Justice. I think that the contract itself specifies
that the contracting officer will decide whether or not
there's a default termination, and once there is that,
they owe -- once the contracting officer so decides,
then they owe the unliquidated payments that have --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that -- isn't
that the affirmative step with the contracting officer
saying there's a default?
GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's certainly an
affirmative step under the terms of the contract, but it
is not an affirmative step of the Federal court. Our
central proposition --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an affirmative
step of the Federal Government. He works for you, and
he's the one changing the status quo.
GENERAL KATYAL: Undoubtedly the case, and
those are the terms under the contract to which they
agreed. Our central proposition is that in a world in
which the Federal court doesn't know, as Justice Scalia
said, who is right and who is wrong on a particular
claim, it should stay its hand entirely and get out of
the business altogether. It should follow the
Hippocratic principle of doing no harm.
JUSTICE ALITO: Am I correct to interpret
what you've just said to mean that you think this case
should be decided under the basic principle of Reynolds,
that the party that seeks the affirmative relief --
seeks affirmative relief from the court is the -- is the
party that bears the burden involving the invocation of
the state-secrets privilege? You're not asking us to
adopt a new test applicable in the contracts situation?
GENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. I don't think
we need to go there. I do think that there are special
arguments available in this case because it is a
contract, as Justice Breyer said, with sophisticated
parties who ex ante will decide who bears the burden of
coming into court and -- and so on. But here I think
this is a simple principle that, in a world in which the
court doesn't know who is right and wrong in the
superior knowledge defense -- and that's the answer to
the question that Justice Sotomayor asked to Mr.
Phillips a moment ago about what did the Court of
Federal Claims ultimately decide. They didn't decide
there was a prima facie case. They said at page 245a of
the 2001 opinion: We can't know one way or the other.
And so --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- could I --
I'm interrupting Justice Alito because you answered his
question very quickly. It's your position that if we
determine you're the moving party, you lose?
GENERAL KATYAL: Oh, no. I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that what your answer
to him --
GENERAL KATYAL: No, we --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- which is that -- he
asked you whether we apply Reynolds; you didn't say
which part of Reynolds. Are you conceding that if we
apply Reynolds and we find you're the moving party, you
lose?
GENERAL KATYAL: Oh, absolutely not, Justice
Sotomayor. I don't think Reynolds says that if the
government is the moving party, it's an automatic loss.
I think that's a back-up argument that we have advanced
in our brief that I think there is no reason whatsoever
for the Court to give its view --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's talk about "moving
party." I -- I don't -- I don't know that "moving
party" means who comes into court first. I would -- I
would -- in the -- in the context of a contract dispute,
I would say the moving party is the party who is trying
to use principles of law to change the contract, and
that's the government here. The government -- the
government is blowing the whistle; it is the government
which is saying you are in default, and under the law,
since you're in default, we can walk away, and indeed we
can claim the money we've already paid you.
GENERAL KATYAL: Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to me the moving
party in the -- in the context of a contract.
GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, I think
it's important to add to your definition "using legal
principles in a Federal court," because that's I think
what Reynolds is talking about. There's not some
abstract moving --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Reynolds was talking about
that because that was the fact situation in Reynolds.
But I'm saying that the logic of the matter -- the logic
of the matter when applied to a contract situation such
as this ought to be the party who is blowing the
whistle, who is trying to use the law, the one -- the
one who is asserting that -- that the law requires this
result. And then we say, well, we can't tell whether
the law requires this result or not. That, it seems to
me, ought to be the moment of truth.
GENERAL KATYAL: I -- I don't think,
Justice, that's what either Reynolds is getting at or
what this Court's subsequent decisions about a state of
uncertainty in the law and what the role of the Federal
courts is getting at. I think, rather, what all of
these decisions say together is if you don't know one
way or another, you should return; you should wind the
clock back to the status quo ante before the lawsuit was
filed. And at that status quo ante, there was undoubted
a right of the government to have $1.35 billion.
Now, I understand some of you have
suggested, well, maybe we should just cut it even and
they get to keep the $1.35 billion and we get to keep --
and we don't have to pay the $1.2 billion. I suggest
there's no principled way to do that, which is what I
think Mr. Phillips's answer --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't the undoubted
right of the government before the lawsuit was filed.
It was the undoubted right of the lawsuit only if the
contracting officer was correct that there had been a
default. If he was wrong about that, it was not the
right of the government.
GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, let me read
to you the contract to which they agreed. It's at Joint
Appendix, page 120 to '21: "If the contract is
terminated under the default clause, the contractor
shall, on demand, repay to the government the amount of
unliquidated progress payments."
And then, what happened, as a result of that
demand letter that we sent right after the -- after the
termination for default, was they came to us, hat in
hand, and said: Please don't take this money from us
right now, our banks are going to complain, and so on.
And so we entered into a deferment agreement --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought --
GENERAL KATYAL: -- which is at page --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Do you
want to give the cite?
GENERAL KATYAL: Joint Appendix page 342.
And it seems to me a very odd notion of due
process to say that somehow the fact that we agreed to
their deferment creates some entitlement for them to
keep the $1.35 billion.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have this -- this
question about due process: The components of the due
process analysis, it seems to me, are what is
reasonable, what's necessary in the case, what's
unconscionable. That it seems to me is just an
extrapolation of what Reynolds said, and I don't know
why we don't have that just as a law of -- of -- the
Federal common law of contracts. I don't know why we
need to elevate this to a due process analysis.
GENERAL KATYAL: I guess I would say two
things. One is, if you look --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assuming that we're -- we
apply Reynolds, which --
GENERAL KATYAL: Right. And I think if you
-- if you were to look to that background common law
contract principle, you would look not just to Reynolds
but to Tenet -- or excuse me, Totten, which I think
makes clear that, at the time they signed their
contract, they were on notice that highly classified
information that is the subject of -- of litigation is
something that generally can't be litigated in the
Federal court.
And then, if you wanted to think about due
process and the overlay of unconscionability or whatever
with respect to Federal contracts, you would ordinarily
assume that the contract itself from highly
sophisticated parties would work that out ahead of time.
And so if they were concerned about this situation
unfolding, they could have written into the contract
that they should get certain information and that if the
government invoked the state-secrets privilege, it would
automatically terminate the contract's default and
convert a default termination into a termination for
convenience.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That just restates the
question of what -- what do you do if you apply the
Reynolds principle to this case, and they would say,
well, you could have put it in your contract, too, and I
think that's almost a wash.
GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I don't think it
comes out as a wash, Justice Kennedy, because I think
the contract is undoubtedly clear that, in order to
challenge the -- the decision of the contracting officer
about a default termination, they have to come into
Federal court and invoke affirmatively, seek affirmative
judicial relief from the Federal court, to change the
world. We don't have to do that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I -- am I right that
this contract did specify certain information that the
government agreed to give the Petitioner?
GENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. Some of
that is at Joint Appendix 137 to 140.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips said the
reason they couldn't specify this information is they
didn't know what it was.
GENERAL KATYAL: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They -- they didn't know
what -- it was secret information. They didn't know --
wouldn't even know what to ask for.
GENERAL KATYAL: I have to say, it is a very
odd thing to bid on a highly -- a multi-billion-dollar
contract on the assumption that they're going to get
some technology that they haven't even specified. I
mean, this -- we're bidding for their research and
development. They brought in Lockheed, who -- which had
built low-technology -- low-observability planes --
precisely for the reason that they said they'd have the
technology. At Joint Appendix page 1087, you see their
bid, their offer, and I don't think anyone held a gun to
their back to say: Enter into this.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but they -- they claim
that you knew that it was impossible to do what they
contracted with you to do at the weight of plane which
they promised to come across with. They say that you
knew that because of -- of other contracts that you had
had, and yet didn't -- didn't tell them about it.
GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, let me say
two things. First, the impossibility of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know whether that's
true or not, and we're never going to know it's true,
because you came in and blew the whistle and said:
State-secrets privilege.
GENERAL KATYAL: Two things. One is that
impossibility claim was separately litigated before the
Court of Federal Claims, along with 18 other claims of
theirs in defense to the 1.35 billion and this rest that
we've been talking about. They've had massive
opportunities to litigate almost all of their
challenges, with the one exception being the superior
knowledge aspect of this case, and much of that has
taken place in a highly classified environment. The
trial has taken place in --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you saying it was not
impossible to do it at that weight?
GENERAL KATYAL: I'm saying -- well, at the
initial weight, we thought it was impossible and warned
them as such, and that's -- those are the citations in
the government's brief. But -- so --
JUSTICE SCALIA: At the weight contracted
for?
GENERAL KATYAL: And then we -- at the
weight contracted for, we had warned them that it
wasn't, and then later we relaxed to that weight
specification. So I'm not sure that is really present
one way or the other.
But our central submission to you, Justice
Scalia, is: If you're not sure, as you were saying to
me -- you don't know who is right and who is wrong --
then the Federal court shouldn't be complicit in the
process of siding and picking winners and losers in that
circumstance --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you ever the --
JUSTICE KAGAN: General, what would
happen --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you ever the
moving party in the Court of Claims?
GENERAL KATYAL: Sure. I could imagine that
we could be on a counterclaim, for example.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, on a
counterclaim, but that obviously means somebody else is
the moving party. They've raised the claim.
GENERAL KATYAL: That's correct. The -- the
jurisdiction of the CFC --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If somebody wants to
get money -- if somebody wants to get money from the
Federal Government, they have to go to the Court of
Claims, right?
GENERAL KATYAL: That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: How do you --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this is a pretty
convenient rule for you, right?
(Laughter.)
GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's a convenient
rule, Mr. Chief Justice, that they agreed to when they
signed the contract. The CDA was on the books. They
knew the deal going in, which is if they wanted to
challenge the decision of the contracting officer, they
would have to come in.
Now, you could have structured it very
differently. You could have said we -- you know, that
there would have to be -- that -- that if there were a
termination for default, it would automatically change
into a termination for convenience --
JUSTICE ALITO: But you have the burden
of -- you had the burden of proof on the issue of
default. That was known, too, wasn't it?
GENERAL KATYAL: We have the burden of proof
on default, but not on superior knowledge, the precise
question here. In their rule, if you -- if you follow
their rule, they're asking the court to proceed
counterfactually and say that they are entitled to not
just the 1.35, but the 1.2 billion on top of that, as if
they had proved their superior knowledge claim. And --
JUSTICE KAGAN: General, what would --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree that -- do
you agree that there is nothing between -- I think
Justice Scalia was asking Mr. Phillips, why can't we
just say let's -- all bets are off, everybody go home
with what they have. But Mr. Phillips says there are
only these two things; there's either default
termination or termination for convenience, and nothing
in between.
Do you agree that that's the world that
we're dealing with, those two choices and nothing else?
GENERAL KATYAL: I do agree that that is --
that's the way the contract is written. It
distinguished between those two and distinguished
between liquidated payments -- as to which the
government has no right in the event of a default
termination, and we're not seeking that -- and
unliquidated payments, as to which the government has an
absolute right at the moment the contracting officer
decides there has been a default termination.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care how the
contract's written. I mean, if we're going to -- if
we're going to say that there's been a broken play, that
we're not going to try to apply the contract because we
can't tell who's in the right and who's in the wrong,
it's totally irrelevant what the contract says. You
just leave the parties where they are.
GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, I am saying
leave the parties where they are under the terms of the
contract. And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're --
GENERAL KATYAL: Well, that -- Justice
Scalia, I don't think that the Federal court should be
in the business of micromanaging under the Due Process
Clause in a contractual situation with parties that can
protect themselves ex ante very easily. I mean, they
say --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: We can -- we can do it as
a member -- as a matter of the law of contracts. And
when we look at the law of contracts in Reynolds,
Reynolds talked about the moving party, and I'm not --
I'm not sure that that phrase either had or has really
definable content in our law. It seems to me it's just
a question of the burden of persuasion.
At one point, the contractor has to proceed.
He makes -- it makes a certain showing, and the
government has to go back and forth. And if at some
point, the person with the burden of persuasion invokes
the privilege, then we have to ask whether it's
fundamentally fair as a matter of the Federal law of
contracts.
GENERAL KATYAL: So even if you followed
that reasoning -- and I don't think you should, for a
reason I'll explain in a moment -- but they would still
lose, because they still bear the burden of proof and
persuasion on superior knowledge, the -- the excuse
that's at issue in this case.
Now, I don't think that would be the rule,
that that's an appropriate rule, Justice Kennedy,
because I think underlying Reynolds is this central
proposition that a court shouldn't be involved,
shouldn't be picking winning -- winners and losers
either way, when the state of knowledge is unknowable.
JUSTICE KAGAN: So just to make sure I
understand your argument, suppose that state secrets had
prevented you from being able to prove your default
claim, that you were unable to make that showing because
of state secrets. What would happen then?
GENERAL KATYAL: Unable to make the showing
in --
JUSTICE KAGAN: That the -- that the --
GENERAL KATYAL: -- in Federal court?
JUSTICE KAGAN: That's right, that the
secrets that you were -- that you wanted to protect were
actually the -- the key to your proving that there was a
default.
GENERAL KATYAL: Right. Well, in that
circumstance, again, the -- I think the case would be
dismissed, because they would be coming in and seeking
affirmative judicial relief to void the contracting
officer's decision and to get whatever damages they want
and --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Let me make sure I
understand, because that really does sound like a tails
you win, heads you win, whatever.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN: You're saying that if the
state secrets prevented you from making your affirmative
case, you should win that one, too?
GENERAL KATYAL: I think -- I think that
that would be -- the general proposition is if the
Federal court can't know one way or another who's right
and who's wrong, it shouldn't grant affirmative relief
to a party, and that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: To a moving party, and you
are never the moving party.
(Laughter.)
GENERAL KATYAL: Well, again, Justice
Scalia, that's the contract they've signed. They could
have signed a different contract with different results.
They say --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you seem --
GENERAL KATYAL: -- we didn't have the
ability --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the contract --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you can't ever
give --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the contract contain
the term "moving party"?
GENERAL KATYAL: The contract didn't say
"moving party," but it did say who had to come into
Federal court in order to challenge the decision of the
contracting officer. And that is a -- that -- that --
and it puts that burden on them.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And now Justice
Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I don't
understand. Yes, the default provision is decided by
the contracting officer, but by law you can't collect on
that judgment once they file a complaint. So you can't
do anything until you get the court to affirm your
default. You are asking for a legal declaration of
being right, that they defaulted. That's -- you're the
one seeking --
GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, this is
a very important question, and I think that that's the
impression left by their briefs and it's wrong. So the
filing of their claim -- their claim in the Court of
Federal Claims they say vacated the contracting
officer's decision. That's wrong under the statute;
5(b) in the -- in the Contracting Disputes Act says
that a clause can be put into the contract to continue
it in effect and require performance even if there's an
appeal to the Court of Federal Claims, and that
provision exists in this very contract. So --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You're going
too fast for me, and I don't think I remember this in
your reply brief.
GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think it is. It's
in a footnote of our reply brief, and it cites to
5(b). And our claim is that -- that that provision
requires -- right now we have an absolute entitlement to
the $1.35 billion. That is what the contract says.
That is what even the deferment agreement says that
we've entered into.
So we're not asking, Justice Sotomayor, for
any affirmative judicial relief at all. We don't need
-- we want the Court, as it does in state-secret cases
such as Tenet, to stay out entirely and say -- to deny
an audience to this case on the merits. And if you do
what Mr. Phillips says or if you do what Justice Scalia
suggested, the kind of compromise option, that is
affirmatively using the power of the Federal court,
granting him relief on a claim that he has not proven,
and that is something I see -- I see zero precedent
for --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's granting nobody
relief. We're leaving you where you are. "Get out of
here," is what we're saying.
(Laughter.)
GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, we have
no --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't know what the
answer is, so go away; we leave you where you are.
(Laughter.)
GENERAL KATYAL: Justice -- Justice Scalia,
we have no problem with a go-away rule. And if you did
that and you returned to the status quo ante, we would
have that $1.35 billion. That is what the contract
says. That is what their own filing in September 16,
91, said before the Court of Federal Claims, when they
called that $1.35 billion, quote, "money presently due
and owing."
JUSTICE SCALIA: That assumes that the
contracting officer's termination for default was valid.
And we don't know that it was valid, and we don't want
to have to inquire whether it was valid. So to say "go
away" means everybody keeps the money he has.
GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that seems
to me -- that is affirmatively using the power of the
Court to set aside the contracting officer's decision,
which is what I think is forbidden by Reynolds. And it
would be an odd rule, because it's basically a
happenstance. If we had just simply insisted on our
$1.35 billion at the moment that it was owed to us in
February of 1991, we wouldn't even be having this
conversation right now. The only reason we're having it
is because we acceded to their own request to not take
the $1.35 billion right away.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How would you write
-- you keep saying these are sophisticated parties.
What would the contractual term look like that would
avoid this problem?
GENERAL KATYAL: Oh, I think it would be
very simple. You could say: In the event the
government invokes the state-secrets privilege, any
termination for default automatically becomes a
termination for convenience. That's one of many.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think your
client would ever agree to something like that?
GENERAL KATYAL: Do I think the government
would?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.
GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think if they
don't, Mr. Chief Justice, that underscores the problem
with their argument, because they are saying: Read the
contract precisely this way, to eliminate terminations
for default and convert them all into terminations for
convenience when the state-secrets privilege is being
invoked. And I agree with you. I think that would be a
very unusual contract for the government to get into.
That is what they're demanding here, and that's
strictly --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how do they write
the contract? If they -- your answer can't be the only
way they can write it is a way that you'd never accept.
So how -- how do you contract around this problem?
GENERAL KATYAL: Well -- well, I think there
are other ways. There's the possibility that they may
demand extra money in exchange for greater risk. There
may be that there may be some alternative dispute
resolution mechanisms available. I don't know, but I
would -- I would --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This wouldn't be a
problem in an alternative dispute resolution because
that's not a court?
GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it might depend on --
you might have it within the military, you know, the
equivalent of that -- in the Tenet v. Doe, you might
have panels like the Helms panel. I'm not sure what the
precise contractual arrangements would be. I do think
that the need for this Court to be involved is a lot
lower than, say, in the criminal context of Reynolds,
because the government here is a repeat player with
these contractors. They're not in the business, as our
deferment agreement, I think, underscores of trying to
willy-nilly advance the state-secrets privilege to
undermine and take their money away.
Indeed, I think since the 2003 Federal
Circuit decision, there have only been a couple of
instances, at most, in which -- that I'm aware of in
which the government has invoked the state-secrets
privilege in any sort of contracting action, and nothing
like this superior knowledge thing. And since 2009, the
government, all together in civil court, has invoked the
state-secrets privilege a whopping two times, to -- to
my knowledge.
JUSTICE BREYER: So it isn't -- it isn't a
big practical problem. All right. Let me ask then, I
was -- misimpression. Would you go back to Justice
Kennedy's question for a minute? I'm -- I -- I don't
quite see -- if you would discuss it a little bit -- how
you do this as a matter of constitutional law, because
the Due Process Clause is tied to fundamental
unfairness, and I think the answer has to be in this
kind of circumstance, secret block or not, it depends.
It depends on many things.
So, would you write this as a matter of
constitutional law? Would it -- shouldn't it be written
as a matter of Federal common law of contracts?
Shouldn't it be written as an exposition of the superior
knowledge doctrine, which seems totally open to it?
And -- or shouldn't it be written as a matter of
discovery law, which is what the district judge who
ended up thinking -- the Court of Claims judge says,
gee, I don't really know.
I mean, that's how I read it. How would you
-- would you speak about this for a minute?
GENERAL KATYAL: Sure. Justice Breyer, I
think that due process is an ill-fitting concept in this
contractual dispute for a couple of reasons. Not just
can the sophisticated parties agree ahead of time to
other things, but also the whole notion of due process
in contracts is odd, because the government has waived
its sovereign immunity only since 1855. They don't have
any freestanding right to come in ab initio and claim
fundamental fairness on contracts. I think that is
implicit in the Constitution itself, that they don't
have that right.
And so, the question becomes, is there some
extra protection the courts should give here akin to the
one in Reynolds about criminal defendants in the
government using state-secrets information? And I think
the answer to that is "no," because parties can work
that out themselves ex ante.
And so, my answer to you is -- I think it
was option B -- to use the contract as the -- and
contractual interpretation as the basic rule for a
decision here. The contract itself specified -- and it
was done under the shadow of Reynolds and under the
shadow of -- of Totten that specified that they would
have to be the moving party. They would have to come in
and challenge the decision of the contracting officer --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in a whole law of
contracts, you could say, oh, the contracting parties
could have put this down, anticipatory breach, we don't
need to have rules on that, that the parties could have
negotiated that. That's not the way the contract law
works.
GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I do think that with
respect to this, in this -- you know,
thousands-and-thousands-of-page contract, I think that
this specific set of issues could have been worked out
in advance and, I do think, was worked out in advance.
They knew, going in, that they bore the burden of
walking into court, paying their attorneys, and
everything else, to challenge the decision of the
contracting officer. And they also knew at that moment
the government had an undoubted right to the
unliquidated progress payments.
The contract they signed distinguished
between liquidated progress payments, as to which the
government has no right, and unliquidated payments, as
to which default termination automatically gave that to
the government. And the argument they're advancing here
is, well, let's collapse those two; let's keep the $1.35
billion, because the government hasn't given it to us
yet.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that unliquidated?
I didn't get the distinction between -- why is the 1.35
unliquidated?
GENERAL KATYAL: Because the contract
specified two payment streams. One is the work that
they had reviewed and understood and said -- the
government had said this is good work, we're going to
pay you for it; and other work which are claims that
they have made but they haven't actually been approved
by the government. And I think Mr. Phillips -- I don't
think that there's any sort of evidence that -- or
certainly nothing that the courts below found that says
that the -- that they had a right to the
unliquidated progress payments.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the other? What's
the -- what's the other 1.25 billion --
GENERAL KATYAL: The 1.2 --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that he's also asking
for?
GENERAL KATYAL: The 1.2 billion that he's
seeking on top of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
GENERAL KATYAL: -- keeping 1.35 billion, as
I understand it, is costs -- is extra costs incurred
under the contract above and beyond the $4.8 billion
that was in the initial contract.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, do you have the
citation to that footnote you referred to in the -- the
5(b)? I can find it later, but --
GENERAL KATYAL: It's page 32, and I'd also
refer the Court to the court of appeals appendix page
567, which is the page of the contract itself that
incorporates the provision. The provision is
FAR 52.233-1(h), and it says that -- it mandates
performance and compliance with the contract even when
there -- in the contracting officer's decision, even
when a decision is under appeal.
So it is not the case whatsoever that their
filing of this claim somehow vacated the contracting
officer's decision. The only way that will happen is if
this Federal Court reverses the Federal Circuit --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your view is that --
GENERAL KATYAL: -- and grants them
affirmative --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that the complaint
did not stay their obligation to pay you; that provision
required them to pay you --
GENERAL KATYAL: That's correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the -- the
unliquidated sums?
GENERAL KATYAL: That's right. At that
moment they had to pay. They knew that, and they in
fact sent a bank letter and so on -- this is Joint
Appendix 329 -- saying please don't do that. And then
we entered into a deferment agreement, but we have an
absolute right to that money right now regardless of
what -- we don't need an affirmative decision from this
Court in order to get that money. We're asking the
Court to simply stay its hand and follow the Hippocratic
principle of doing no harm in a world in which the --
the Court can't decide who's right and who's wrong.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If that -- if you're
right about that, the government's absolute right, could
you withhold it from other contracts of these
contractors?
GENERAL KATYAL: That's absolutely right.
The -- the Federal rules and the Contract Disputes Act
provide us an offset so that we could -- we don't have
to actually seek the 1.35 billion from their coffers, as
he colorfully called it, "reaching into"; we can just
offset it against future contracts, and the Federal
courts would be out of the business altogether about
that 1.35 billion.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you get the extra
money without having to go to court because then they'd
have to go to court and challenge your offset?
GENERAL KATYAL: And, again, Mr. Chief
Justice, that's the contract to which they signed.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.
Mr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Justice Kennedy, I think the answer to your
question is that this case can properly be decided on
Federal common law principles, and indeed I would ask
the Court to apply those same -- those contract
principles in this context to -- it's just on the Joint
Appendix on page 209.
General Katyal focuses on what happens when
the contracting officer takes some action. What he
leaves out is the following sentence: The contractor
shall have the right of appeal under the disputes clause
from any determination by the contracting officer.
And while the General spends an awful lot of
time talking about what do you do in the Article III
context, the Contracting Disputes Act specifically
allows to us go to a board of contract appeals, which is
not an Article III institution. And I guarantee you
that the government would be making exactly the same
argument if we had taken that particular route.
It seems to me the case ought not to be
decided on the basis of this kind of a technical
assessment. The case ought to be decided on the basis
of sort of where the rights are and what's the
fundamental change and who's making the shift in one
direction or the other.
And if you do that -- and Justice Ginsburg,
you specifically asked the question, am I asking for all
or nothing? No. I think there's no question you can
come up with a principled basis to adopt precisely the
principle that Justice Scalia pointed out, which is to
say we will stay our hand, we'll -- we will not uphold
the -- the contracting officer's decision, and therefore
we're not going to say there's a default --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- but we're not going to go
the extra mile and say it's a termination for
convenience. The Court can certainly do that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you are saying there
is another way? There's a middle way?
MR. PHILLIPS: There is a middle way.
There's no question about it. All I was saying in
response to Justice Scalia's question was, you know --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On what principle of
law?
MR. PHILLIPS: On the principle of law that
if you don't have a contract for default, then there's
no basis for -- and we're not going to do any more than
that; we can't decide who's right and who's wrong, and
therefore we're not going to enforce the contracting
officer's decision, or we're not going to do anything
more than this. We're going to leave the status quo
ante, which means before the contracting officer
declared that there was a default under these
circumstances.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the "go away"
principle of our jurisprudence, right?
(Laughter.)
MR. PHILLIPS: I actually get that a lot,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, I understood
your papers as making only a constitutional claim.
MR. PHILLIPS: No. I don't read that,
Justice Kagan. I mean, we -- we certainly have a due
process argument in there, but embedded in there as well
is -- are a number of references to Federal common law
principles as a -- as a -- obviously nonconstitutional
basis on which to rule in our favor.
And I -- I mean, I think the Court ought to
be informed in -- in making its determination about how
to interpret the contracting arrangement by the question
of whether this is fundamentally unfair and
unconscionable, obviously, but you would probably do
that as a matter of Federal common law principles in
trying to decide on the -- on contracting principles or
not.
At the end of the day, Your Honors, this has
been fundamentally unfair, and we would ask for the
Court to reverse.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Phillips, General.
The case is submitted.
