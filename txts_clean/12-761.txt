CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
next in Case No. 12-761, POM Wonderful v. The Coca-Cola
Company.
Mr. Waxman?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Lanham Act provides a remedy for
businesses whose market is misappropriated by
competitors that misrepresent the character of the goods
they sell.  This case presents an egregious violation of
the law.  Coca-Cola's label grossly misleads  consumers ,
as Coke anticipated, but Coke says that it need not
answer under the Lanham Act because its label is
authorized by FDA regulations.  The label is not, in
fact, authorized for reasons we explain and with which
the United States largely agrees, but even if it were
consistent with FDA regulations that would not strip POM
of its right to prove a willful Lanham Act violation.
Courts are obligated to give full effect to
Congressional enactments wherever possible.  Here
Congress has never precluded or conditioned enforcement
of the Lanham Act in food labeling cases, and it is
entirely possible, in fact, entirely easy for Coke to
comply with both statutory obligations.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If there is no private
cause of action to enforce the FDA label standards, only
the FDA can bring a proceeding to say that an ad
violates its regulations, how does a Court below,
without interpreting the regulations, go about deciding
whether or not a particular ad doesn't comport with the
regulations and hence would be subject to the Lanham
Act?
MR. WAXMAN:  Justice --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Maybe that's a better
question for the SG, but I'm trying to figure out --
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, let me take a shot at it
and, you know, the SG can and Ms. Sullivan can, as well.
There's no question under -- as this Court
explained in Buckman, that there is no private cause of
action to enforce provisions of the FDCA.  Now, this
Court in Buckman distinguished Medtronic v. Lohr, which
provided and held -- and did not and save from preemption a
state law that was- that  imposed parallel requirements, and in
that instance, and this is not a case involving an
attempt to enforce parallel requirements under state law
or any other law.  In those circumstances, as the
government explains, of course a court is going to be
required to ascertain what those parallel requirements
are, and whether they were or  weren’t complied with.
But this is a case involving a different
statute.  Our submission is that it is entirely
irrelevant whether or not the Coke label, in any
particular, is consistent with a regulation that
implements criminal prohibitions by announcing when and
under what limited circumstances the FDA will forebear
from exercising its criminal and regulatory penalties.
Even in that instance, with respect, Your Honor, as this
Court explained in Wyeth, misbranding provisions are, in
fact, adjudicated by courts even under the FDCA.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so do you concede that
under the Lanham Act, plaintiff could not challenge
aspects of the a food label that the FDA said is
required?
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I know that's not this
case.
MR. WAXMAN:  Thank you.
Let me just say, not only is that not this
case because the FDA has never examined --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I want you to answer the
question, though.
MR. WAXMAN:  My answer to the question would
be, under Wyeth, under this Court's decision in Wyeth,
the FDCA and the FDA's regulations interpreting it and
applying it, supply a floor and not a ceiling.  And the
FDA would have no authority -- if the FDA said, This
label is fine and you are required to use this label,
the question would be, does it have the statutory
authority to essentially create an immunity from
enforcement of another federal statute that protects a
different purpose and a different class of victims?  The
answer would be no.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Justice Kennedy's question,
I think, was different.  He said, suppose that it said
you are required to use this label and only this label,
then you would acknowledge that there is an
impossibility issue; is that right?
MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.  Unless, as in Wyeth,
there was, in fact, some possibility to change the
label, but if -- and I apologize if I didn't understand
the question.  If the FDA said, counterfactually, we've
examined this label, you are not only permitted to use
it but you are required to use it, and unlike what we do
with respect to pharmaceuticals, you are not allowed to
make any changes.  In that instance, there would be an
irreconcilable conflict and a Court would have to decide
which of two opposite-facing canons of construction to
give primacy to, but that would be impossibility.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why isn't there a different
kind of conflict here?  Let's just focus on the name,
which is what the solicitor general says the FDA has
considered and has specifically permitted.  They went
through this very long and involved process, and they
decided exactly what kind of names were permitted for
this kind of product and what were not permitted,
because they constituted misbranding.  And essentially
the FDA has said, This is what counts as misbranding,
nothing else counts as misbranding.  And now you're
coming in and under a Lanham Act claim saying, no, the
FDA is wrong.  This is misbranding.  That seems -- why
isn't that a problem?
MR. WAXMAN:  Why isn't that a problem?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  That the FDA said
it's not misbranding, you're saying it is misbranding.
That seems a quite direct conflict as to what the FDA
says versus what you are alleging under the Lanham Act.
MR. WAXMAN:  So we know that that is not, in
fact, how the FDA construes its regulation, and we know
that because just by examining the FDA's own limited
enforcement history, all the parties have cited the
Court --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, just hypothetically,
let's say that the FDA said that this name was not
misbranding, that this name was fine under their
regulations, that they did not count as misbranding.
MR. WAXMAN:  So we're challenging the label
as a whole, which is covered by -- under the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  So I understand
that, you would have some claims about different parts
of the label.  But I'm only asking about your
claiming as -- your claim as to the specific thing that
the FDA ruled on.
MR. WAXMAN:  Right.  And the question is
whether Congress gave any indication and it would have
to, in this context where the Lanham Act is an express
statutory enactment that Congress was well aware of when
it enacted the Nutrition Labeling Act and, in fact, was
told, not just by the industry, but by  OMB, in
testimony, that the Lanham Act was being used to police
misrepresentations of the character of food products,
you would have to conclude that Congress intended to
allow the FDA to supply, if you will, the substantive
rule of decision under a different statute that uses
different words and -- and protects a different class of
people when -- and here again, I think it's an important
indicator why Congress didn't mean that.  The FDA, the
misbranding provisions of the FDCA are prohibitions.
They are not permissions.  And the rules that the FDA
has promulgated announce essentially an enforcement
forbearance.  They don't represent a judgment and the
Federal Register provisions that we've cited that
accompanied the promulgation of the juice naming
regulations make this as clear as day.  They do not
represent a pronouncement that for all purposes, for all
statutes, the name on -- the name ascribed to the
product is okay.  In fact, they say although for
purposes of our forbearance under our government
enforcement authority, we will allow you to do one or
the other -- and this is 2919 and 2920 of Federal
Register 58, We warn manufacturers that even compliance
with this, where there is a small amount of the
non-predominant juice name has great capacity to mislead
and we encourage -- twice in the rulemaking, we
encourage manufacturers, nonetheless, to name the juices
in the product.  Under those circumstances, the notion
that Congress intended this type of regulation to
preclude a case in which -- and these are the facts as
the Court -- as they come to the Court -- Coke well knew
and intentionally designed a label that, in fact,
grossly misleads consumers to the economic disadvantage
of the company that, in large part, created the market.
And the notion that Congress wanted to allow the FDA to
apply substantive rules of decision in that very
different inquiry using very different language in a
different statute, I think, is completely unsupported.
I mean --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What would be the
components of the injunctive relief that you would seek?
Assuming you have a Lanham Act claim, what should Coke
have done to make its product non-misleading?
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, we have in -- in the
course of our complaint, we didn't specify -- I mean,
the injunction that we would seek is ceasing to use the
label as it currently exists, and of course --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Without saying what label
would be lawful?
MR. WAXMAN:  That's correct.  It's just as
in criminal actions under the FDCA and civil actions
under parallel state laws and actions under the Lanham
Act, juries aren't required or permitted to give
prescriptive judgments.  All that they may -- all they
do is make a judgment about whether or not on balance,
there is substantial evidence that to the harm of the
competitor, a substantial number of consumers are
misled, and if so, was it willful.  And that is no more
of a problem in this particular case than it is in any
of these cases, whether they involve food or anything
else.  In Wyeth versus Levine, the plaintiff had all
sorts of reasons -- all sorts of different theories
about what the warning label should or shouldn't say.
The jury simply decided that it violated the common law
of the state of Vermont to use that particular label.
And the FD -- I'm sorry.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose the percentage were
a lot higher.  Suppose it was 50 percent pomegranate and
blueberry.
MR. WAXMAN:  It's hard to see how we
would have a -- it's hard to see how we would have a --
could possibly prevail in a Lanham Act case.  I mean, we
have to come up with -- we have to adduce, it's our
burden, substantial evidence to show that a substantial
number of competitors -- of consumers are not only
misled, but misled to the detriment of our product.  I
don't think we could establish it.  But Coke's argument,
and for that matter the government's argument, with
respect to the name itself, would apply if, unlike the
eyedropper's worth of pomegranate juice that's in the
half-gallon bottle, there were two microns.  I mean,
this -- the question simply is whether a manufacturer
like Coca-Cola can design something that it knows runs a
substantial risk, quote, "from a misleading
perspective."  And the evidence shows that over a third
of consumers who look at this label believe that
pomegranate and blueberry juice, in fact, are the
majority juices.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it were the -- what
if it were the case that there were very small number of
people who were allergic to one of these ingredients?
I'm not suggesting it's true.  For all I know, it's not.
But let's say there are a few people who are very
allergic to pomegranate juice or blueberry juice.  And
so the FDA says, if you put even an eyedropper full of
that in your blend, you have to put that prominently on
the bottle so that these people will not inadvertently
get an allergic reaction.  Could you have a Lanham Act
claim then?
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, of course, pome -- the
only thing that consumers know is that -- from the front
label is that there is pomegranate -- arguably
pomegranate juice and blueberry juice in here.  So the
question would be whether they had to disclose on the
label whether there was also .01 percent strawberry
juice or 99.4 percent apple and grape juice.  That's the
kind of judgment that we want the FDA to make, because
the purpose of the FDCA is protect public health and
safety.
What the FDA doesn't do, particularly given
the criminal nature of its sanctions, is regulate or
interpret, apply its forbearance authority with an eye
toward, well, what kinds of things are going to so
mislead consumers that they think there is going to be a
substitute in the marketplace where there isn't.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what I'm saying is
suppose it's the case that for 99.999 percent of the
population, the more pomegranate juice, the better, you
just can't drink enough of it.  The more you drink, the
healthier you are.  But for this tiny percentage of the
population, it could produce an allergic reaction.  And
so the FDA says, you've got to put that on there even if
there is just a tincture of pomegranate juice.  Could
you have a Lanham Act claim on the ground for the vast
majority of your potential customers, they are going to
be misled, because they want pomegranate juice and they
are buying this stuff that just has a little bit of it
in it?
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I think the vast --
presumably, and we're talking about a hypothetical
regulation, presumably the FDA would promulgate a
requirement that, in fact, you must name each of the --
each of the constituent juices in case there is an
allergy.  I mean, we wouldn't have an objection -- the
argument wouldn't be that consumers are misled by that
fact alone.  What's misleading consumers here is they
have no way on God's green earth of telling that the
total amount of blueberry and pomegranate juice in this
product can be dispensed with a single eyedropper.  It
amounts to a teaspoon in a half gallon.  And the FDA
has -- the FDA has explained in this case that it has no
expertise, it has no warrant to interpret or understand
or apply judgments about what kind of words and symbols
and the combination thereof, to use the language of the
Lanham Act, will have a tendency to misrepresent the
nature or quality of the goods from the perspective of
the competitor.  And that's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you agree that if you
brought this suit under state law, it would be
preempted?
MR. WAXMAN:  We think it certainly would not
be preempted under state law.  The state law provision,
Justice Kennedy, is Section 110660 of the California
Health and Safety Code, which -- the language of which
is in haec verba with the very first subsection of the
misbranding statute 343(A), which declares misbranded
any label which is false in particular -- false and
misleading in any particular.  That subsection is not
even the subject -- it's excluded from the limited
preemption provisions of the NLEA.  So it certainly
wouldn't be preempted.  There might be an open question
if one of the things that we were challenging in the
course of that state lawsuit was the name itself, and
the question then would be is this name, in fact,
compliant with the FDA regulation?
Now, we've explained in our brief that there
are three reasons why it is not compliant.  And the
United States agrees that a remand would be appropriate
in any case to determine whether it is compliant.  But
generally speaking, our state law claim wouldn't be
preempted at all.  Not only is it parallel to the
misbranding provision, but the provision that it's
parallel to is not preempted.
Unless the Court has further questions, I
would like to reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
Ms. Sherry.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY
MS. SHERRY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
If I could start with the naming aspect of
the case.  Justice Kagan, you are exactly right.  We
have a circumstance here where we have two Federal
statutes that cover the same subject matter that apply
functionally the same standard to the same words on the
same product label.
Under the FDCA, we have an authoritative
interpretation of that language by the FDA.  102.33 is a
regulation that was reached after extensive rule-making
proceedings over the course of 25 years.  The FDA
considered the exact same question that is being raised
here.  It looked to figure out what an appropriate
common or  usual name was for a juice blend that had a
small amount of a highly flavorful and expensive juice
in order to allow consumers to know -- in order to
prevent consumers from being misled as to the juice
content of that particular product.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What public health benefit
is served by this regulation?  This is what puzzles me
about it.
MS. SHERRY:  The regulations comes under the
misbranding provisions of the FDCA.  So 343 focuses on
misbranding.  It has a number of subsections, one of
which gives the FDA authority to establish common or
usual names of products.  And the purpose of that is to
have some form of standardization so that when a
consumer goes to a marketplace to purchase a particular
product, it knows what is going to be in the product.
And, in fact, that was the purpose of the very
regulation at issue here, the idea being by allowing
manufacturers to choose to name their juice product
based on the juice that flavors the product as opposed
to based on the juice that is predominant by volume,
that consumers will come to understand that when a juice
says pomegranate and blueberry flavored, what it means
is that the juice is present as a flavor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  I'm not sure
that -- I mean, the argument is you can't even taste
these flavors.  That's their point.  And you are taking
a contrary point, that the flavor doesn't mean what you
taste, flavor means something else.
MS. SHERRY:  No, no.  The point is -- and I
think the argument that Petitioner is making has to do
with the particular facts of this case.  The argument is
because there is only 0.3 percent of pomegranate juice,
that it is not actually enough to flavor the beverage.
And that's a factual question that could be resolved on
remand.  But Petitioner's argument with respect to the
name would be exactly the same, Justice Alito, if there
was 10 percent of pomegranate juice in this product or
there was 15 percent.  In Petitioner's view, a Lanham
Act claim could still go forward in those circumstances
because there would be no irreconcilable conflict.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then, Ms. Sherry, you --
the government is taking the position that it's okay for
District Courts to determine whether labels, in fact,
comply or don't comply with FDA regulations?
MS. SHERRY:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And if they decide they
don't comply, that's when they can could permit a Lanham
Act claim?
MS. SHERRY:  That's correct.  And let me try
to explain why I don't think  that’s inconsistent with
the notion of the FDA having exclusive enforcement
authority with respect to the FDCA.  This is still a
Lanham Act claim.  So the only thing that is being
enforced is the Lanham Act.  The FDCA and the FDA
regulations come up by virtue of the preclusion defense
that is being raised by Respondents here.  And so in the
course of adjudicating that defense, we agree that
district courts can look to the FDA regulations to
determine compliance, of course, by applying all the
normal rules of deference that would otherwise apply in
those circumstances.  And as my colleague --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do I understand your
position to be that then if the label is specifically
authorized, then the Lanham Act is precluded, but if the
FDCA has just simply failed to forbid it then it's not?
Is that your distinction you draw.
MS. SHERRY:  I think so.  If I could just
articulate it --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because if it is, I think
it's very hard to work with.
MS. SHERRY:  And I will try to articulate it
slightly differently and explain why we don't think it
is difficult to work with.  What we're saying is that if
the FDA or the FDCA provisions have specifically
permitted something here, they've specifically permitted
this type of name in certain circumstances, that that is
something that should preclude a Lanham Act claim.  To
the extent the FDCA or the FDA has not spoken to the
particular issue with any degree of specificity, we
don't see a problem with the Lanham Act claim going
forward, because in that case you're not really second-
guessing any judgment --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, Ms. Sherry, applied
to this case, so we have -- you said the name is okay,
pomegranate and blueberry flavored, but you say the
label is something different from the name and the
Lanham Act can apply to the label.  So what parts of the
label are you saying are not touched -- are not
preempted by the FDA laws?
MS. SHERRY:  We're drawing a distinction --
when we say the name, we mean the actual words
themselves, "pomegranate blueberry flavored blendified
juices."  When we talk about the label more generally,
we mean how those words are presented on the label and
other aspects of the label.
And if I could point the Court to the Nestle
warning letter, it's discussed in a number of the
different briefs and it's cited at footnote 7 of our
brief.  I think my colleague was going to bring it up
earlier.  I actually think this letter proves the very
distinction that we're trying to make.  What the FDA
said in that letter was that the juice labels at issue
there were misleading, not because of the name, but
because how the words of the name were displayed on the
label, because the words "orange tangerine," for
example, were placed next to the picture of an orange,
because they were in close proximity to "100 percent" --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the label
just had the name on it, nothing else?  Could they still
sue on the ground that the label was misleading?
MS. SHERRY:  Not unless they are able to
point to something else on the label that was misleading
aside from the actual words in the name.  The difficulty
we have with the naming aspect of the Lanham Act claim
here is the arguments that Petitioner is making that
they should have instead named this "apple grape juice,"
that they should have instead included the percentage
declarations, are arguments that the FDA
specifically considered when it adopted this rule and it
ultimately objected.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does the FDA -- does
the FDA take into account purely commercial confusion
when it issues -- when it issued its regulations
governing the label?  Or is it limited solely to the,
what I would expect, you know, the health and well-being
concerns?
MS. SHERRY:  It absolutely took into account
-- into account consumer confusion.  There were comments
with respect to this particular regulation, and the
commenters were consumers saying that they were
concerned that they were being misled with respect to
the juice content.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What does the FDA
know about that?  I mean, I would understand if it was
the FTC or something like that, but I don't know that
the FDA has any expertise in terms of consumer confusion
apart from any health issues.
MS. SHERRY:  I'm not sure that is right.
The misbranding provisions, 343(a)(1), speak generally
about labels that are false or misleading in any
particular.  And in adopting the common or usual name
here, that is something that the FDA was specifically
focused on.
The other point I would make is, in
the court of appeals in the reply brief at page 23, the
Petitioner acknowledges and argues that the misleading
standard for the Lanham Act and for the FDCA are not
materially different from one another.
Another point I would make with respect
to the regulation --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Sherry, you know, there
is no irreconcilable conflict if we view what the FDA
has done as just setting a floor.  And you talk a lot
about how, oh, the FDA specifically considered this and
it decided not to do this.  You put a lot of emphasis on
process.
And I guess my question to you is, is that
the way you are saying we should know whether the FDA
has only set a floor or instead has also set a ceiling,
that we're supposed to look to the process and figure
out whether the FDA specifically rejected a more
extensive proposal, a more aggressive proposal?
MS. SHERRY:  No.  I think you look to
whether or not allowing the claim to go forward would
complement what the agency has done or would actually
conflict with what the agency has done.  And here, we
think there is a real conflict.  We're not talking about
supplementing the agency's enforcement resources.  We're
talking about supplanting their regulatory judgment in
the area.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess I don't
understand that.  Why wouldn't it complement?  You've
said here is the floor to make it not misleading, but,
you know, we are not saying that there are some things
that, you know, wouldn't mislead a lot of consumers
anyway, and then the Lanham Act can come in and
supplement that and really put us in a position where
nothing is misleading at all.
MS. SHERRY:  Oh, for two reasons.  Number
one, because the agency considered why manufacturers
would want to actually name their product based on the
flavor, because consumers actually do care about the
flavor and they care about the taste.  If the product
had the name "apple grape juice," for example, and it in
fact tasted like pomegranate blueberry juice, a consumer
might be very surprised when he came home and had a sip
of that juice and realized it tasted like something very
different than what he expected.
JUSTICE ALITO:  You don't think there are a
lot of people who buy pomegranate juice because of --
they think it has health benefits and they would be very
surprised to find when they bring home this bottle
that's got a big picture of a pomegranate on it and it
says "pomegranate" on it, that it is -- what is it, less
than one-half of one percent pomegranate juice?
MS. SHERRY:  And I think --
JUSTICE ALITO:  The FDA didn't think that
would mislead consumers?
MS. SHERRY:  I think -- I think there is a
reasonable argument that it may.  And if I could just go
to the second part of my argument here.  We've been
talking all about the naming part of the claim at issue
here.  We agree with Petitioners that the remainder of
the Lanham Act claim shouldn't be allowed to proceed,
that it is complementary.  We agree with Petitioners
that the Ninth Circuit decision here adopted an overly
broad understanding of preclusion.
Now respondent suggests it doesn't defend the
Ninth Circuit's decision here in footnote 5 of their
brief, but it's a little bit hard to see what daylight
there actually is between the Ninth  Circuit's
approach and that of Respondent.  Respondent relies on
the express preemption clause here, but the express
preemption clause applies only to State or local law.
By its terms, it doesn't apply to Federal law and it
doesn't apply to the Lanham Act.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Sullivan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. SULLIVAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The FDCA does not deal just with health.
Section 341 makes clear that it also and with respect to
the labeling requirements at issue here, quote,
"promotes honesty and fair dealing in the interest of
consumers."  And here, the most important data we have
about what Congress did that's barely been mentioned by
POM or the government, is the enactment in 1990 of the
NLEA, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, and its
express preemption provision.
Now, Justice Kennedy, our position is that
if POM's suit had been brought as a State law lawsuit,
it would be precisely preempted by the terms of that
express preemption provision.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the NLEA provision
doesn't preempt all State law claims, only some State
law claims.
MS. SULLIVAN:  That's correct, Justice
Ginsburg.  And it preempts precisely these claims if
they had been brought As state law claims, because let's
look at the language of the express preemption
provision. And To be clear, Coca-Cola's position is very
narrow.  Our position is that were these claims that POM
is making brought as State law claims, they would be
expressly preempted, and it cannot be that Congress
meant to preempt these claims if brought as State law
claims designed to go above the Federal floor, but
meant to say never mind --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why can't it be?  I
mean, there are plenty of statutes which say you can't
bring State law or Federal law claims.  Congress knows
how to do that.  And instead, it said you can only
not bring State law claims.
MS. SULLIVAN:  In fact, Justice Kagan, it's
very rare that Congress actually says no State or
Federal claims.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  They just say no claims or
no -- notwithstanding any law to the contrary.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Fair enough, Your Honor.  But
you have said in numerous cases in which you have found
a prior or more general law narrowed by a subsequent or
more specific law, you have said Congress should not be
put to the burden every time it enacts a statute of
looking to the four corners of the U.S. Code and
figuring out what it might displace.  And there is no
reason --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you have an example,
Ms. Sullivan, of a case where Congress precluded some
State claims and said nothing at all about Federal laws
in which this Court has held that the express preclusion
of State law claims implicitly precluded Federal claims?
MS. SULLIVAN:  I cannot, Justice Ginsburg,
though I can cite to you the most relevant and unbroken
line of court of appeals authority, which are the
Federal Railroad Safety Act cases.  The Federal Railroad
Safety Act expressly preempted State law negligence
claims, and the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Circuits have
held, without a competing circuit, that therefore,
Federal  FELA negligence claims must be deemed to be
precluded, because otherwise, the national scheme of
uniformity in Federal railroad safety would be
undermined.  So, too, here.
And if I could just go back, Justice
Ginsburg, to make sure I answer the question.  The
passage of the NLEA and its express preemption provision
in 1990 was all about national uniformity.  In fact,
what Congress aimed at in passing that statute was
the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it part of Coke's
narrow position that national uniformity consists in
labels that cheat the consumers like this one did?
MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Kennedy, you have
perhaps succumbed to Mr. Waxman's attempts to argue his
jury argument here.  We're on a motion to dismiss.
There is no record.  We've put in a brief --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think it's important for
us to know how the statutes work.  And if the statute
works in the way you say it does and that Coca-Cola
stands behind this label as being fair to consumers,
then I think you have a very difficult case to make.  I
think it's relevant for us to ask whether people are
cheated in buying this product.  Because Coca-Cola's
position is to say even if they are, there's nothing we
can do about it.  Do you still have this -- do you still
have this label?
MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  It's
changed in non-material aspects.  There is no aspect
covered by the claims here that has changed.
But I just want to be very, very clear on
what POM is arguing here.  POM is arguing -- and,
Justice Sotomayor, they are not arguing your
hypothetical.  POM is arguing here that it may challenge
Coca-Cola's name and label under the Lanham Act even if
that name and label complies with the FDCA and all the
relevant implementing regulations.  So, Justice Kagan,
this is exactly your case, where POM said it can say
misbranded under the Lanham Act, even where Coca-Cola
has complied with all of the authorizations set forth in
the FDA.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But maybe the two acts
are serving different purposes, Ms. Sullivan.  The law
that you are relying on is supposed to be concerned with
nutritional information and health claims, not a
competitor is a competitor losing out because of the
deception.  The consumer is able to buy the Coke product
much cheaper and the POM product costs more; the
consumer thinks that they are both the same, so they'll
buy the cheaper one.
MS. SULLIVAN:  First, Justice Ginsburg, let
me be clear:  Safety is not at issue in this case.
Safety warnings are especially carved out.  Justice
Alito, if there is a worry about allergies; Chief
Justice Roberts, if there is a worry about health.
That's not what we're about here.  In fact, the NLEA
especially -- expressly in 6(c)(2) carved out safety
warnings from the preemption clause.  We're not talking
here about safety.
we're talking here about labeling so that
consumers have adequate information, at the same time as
manufacturers are not put to the burdens and
inefficiencies of having constantly shifting labeling
standards imposed by juries, which ultimately will cost
more to the consumer.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, let's -- let's
assume the following.  The FDA just wanted to know what
the name should be.  That's all they are regulating.
That's the only requirement.  And it's not even a
requirement.
MS. SULLIVAN:  It's an authorization.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's an authorization.
And that's where I'm having a little bit of difficulty,
because it's not that you have to use this name, you're
permitted to use this name under their regulations.  But
why are you permitted to use it in a misleading way?
That's really the -- I think the government's position,
which is, if you're using the name in combination with
other factors in a misleading way that's not a subject
to the regulation, just the name, then it's actionable
under the Lanham Act.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Sotomayor and Justice
Kennedy, I need to make very clear that we believe that
under the FDCA and the FDA regulations, Coke's label is
as a matter of law not misleading.  And once we reach
that conclusion under FDCA and FDA, Lanham Act can't
come in from the side and say, oh, yes, it is, because
that would undermine the express preemption provision
that was designed to create national uniformity.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could the government --
I think what the government is saying nothing about our
permission goes to the size of the name on the label --
MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that you can break up
the name of the juice into two different sizes so that
you are deemphasizing it.  It also says that the
vignette is misleading because it shows products that
have potentially nothing in their regulations say
anything about  vignettes -- and how they display them.
It's -- nothing in the regulations talk about using
purple instead of whatever that color is that the juice
is, that blue, purple, whatever, instead of the color of
apple juice.  If you use the color of apple juice and
grapes, it would be a  light color.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Sotomayor, there are
five different attacks that POM has made on our label,
only two of which were addressed in the lower court.
And we say that we comply with FDA regulations as to all
five of them.  But more important, compliance doesn't
matter; what matters is are these of the type covered by
the provisions of the NLEA preemption provision --
sorry.  Are these of a type covered through the NLEA
preemption provision?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You basically are
talking about field preemption.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Absolutely not, Your Honor.
Let me make absolutely clear we do not argue for field
preemption.  We argue that where the NLEA express
preemption provision would make POM's claims expressly
preempted under State law, it follows as a matter of
inference from the national uniform scheme that Congress
set up, that Lanham Act claims are precluded to the
extent and only to the extent the state claims would
have been preempted under if they were brought as state
law claims.
Now, Justice Sotomayor, all five of POM's
issues here -- name, vignette, font size, multiple
lines, and coloring -- name, vignette, font size,
multiple lines, and coloring -- every one of those is of
the type required by certain enumerated sections in the
NLEA express preemption provision.  And POM wants
something that is not identical.
Justice Ginsburg, POM doesn't just want to
enjoin our label.  POM at JA61 said:  You should have
called it apple grape juice, not pomegranate blueberry
juice.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, Mr. Waxman
clarified that that's not what they are seeking.  They
just want to say your label is misleading.  And is
there -- what statute or regulation of the FDA says that
compliance with the permissive regulation of the FDA
necessarily renders the label non-misleading?
MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Ginsburg, every
single aspect of their misleadingness claim is covered
by specific provisions of the FDCA that have preemptive
force.  Under -- I just want you to focus, if on nothing
else, because my colleagues on the other side haven't
even mentioned it, on 21 USC 343-1)(a)(2) and (3), the
express preemption provision.  The express preemption
provision says --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where is that set
forth in the --
MS. SULLIVAN:  It's set forth, Mr. Chief
Justice, in the red brief addendum at page 5A.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.
MS. SULLIVAN:  And if you look at the
express preemption provision, which is notably called
"National Uniform Nutrition Labeling," Section (2) and
Section (3) on 5A over to 6A, set forth those portions
of the FDCA that will and won't have preemptive force.
We are living in this case entirely within two sections
that have preemptive force under this statute, and those
are sections 343(i) and 343(f).  "Name" is covered by
343(i).  "Vignette" is covered by 343(i) because, as the
Federal Register makes clear, name and vignette were
thought of together.
"Font size" is covered by 343(f), which goes
to the presentation of the name and other printed matter
on the label.  "Multiple lines" is covered by 343(f),
and "coloring" is covered by 343(i)(2).
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Sullivan, can I ask --
if this gets you away from the argument you want to
make, I apologize for that.  But suppose we thought that
the preemption provision here was utterly irrelevant,
that it applies to state law and not Federal law, and
that you can't go around broadening the statute just
because the purposes behind that statute might be
thought to apply to something else.  So suppose I just
put that aside.  Do you still have any kind of argument?
MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Your Honor, we still win
because of your more general approach to preclusion by
one Federal statute of another, because the FDA
regulations as to misbranding here are far more
specific.  Let me back up.  The statute of the FDCA and
the regulations promulgated thereunder are more specific
than the general misrepresentation provisions of the
Lanham Act.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you say that even --
I -- I take it I'm characterizing your position right.
You say that even if there's a violation of the FDA
regulations, they still couldn't sue under the Lanham
Act because that's for the FDA.
MS. SULLIVAN:  We do -- we do not take that
position here, Your Honor, because it's not presented
here.  We said there might --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought that was -- I
thought that was at Page 39 in your brief in a footnote.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Kennedy, let me be
clear.  In this case we believe the Lanham Act claim is
precluded because POM wants to go above the floor set by
the FDCA and the FDA reg.  POM has said repeatedly in
this case, right through the reply brief -- right
through its reply brief at Page 17, and I quote, and
this has been their position the whole time, POM's
challenge does not depend on the FDCA or FDA's
regulation.
Justice Sotomayor, POM is not bringing your
hypothetical suit where they come in to enforce the FDCA
and the FDA.  Had they done so, we think there might be
a serious question for you to resolve another day about
whether that's an end run around 337(a)'s restriction of
enforcement to the United States and prohibition of
private lawsuits, but that's not this case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I understood them to say
they were making a Lanham Act challenge.  And there is
no judicial review of the FDA regulations.  There's no
private right of action under the FDA.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So they are not saying,
We're bringing an action under the FDCA or the NLEA.
They say, We're bringing a Lanham Act.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Correct, Your Honor.
But what I'm trying to say here is, to the
extent their Lanham Act claims seeks to say, as Justice
Kagan said before, You are misbranded for
misrepresentations under the Lanham Act, even though
Coke has not been misbranded and has not made
misrepresentations under FDCA and the FDA regulations,
that is a conflict that should be resolved by this Court
in the usual manner that statutory construction
conflicts are resolved by making the statutes make sense
together.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know why --
I don't know why it's impossible to have a label that
fully complies with the FDA regulations and also happens
to be misleading on the entirely different question of
commercial competition, consumer confusion that has
nothing to do with health.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, as I said
before, the FTC in Section 341 as codified expressly
refers to maintaining honesty for the consumer as well
as health.  But just let me suggest why there is still a
conflict, and irreconcilable conflict is not the
touchstone.  You have never required irreconcilable
conflict in -- in all the cases we have cited in our
brief, Fausto and Elgin, Keogh, Romani, Daystar.  You've
never required irreconcilable conflict.  You've
recognized that one federal statute, if more specific,
may narrow the scope of a more general statute where
there is a conflict.
And there is a conflict here, Your Honor.
Just to be clear, what Congress wanted was national
uniformity so that a manufacturer could print one label
and sell in the 50 states and not have its juice legal
when you leave on the flight in California and
illegal when you land in D.C.  That national uniformity
bill --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the Lanham -- the
Lanham Act applies nationally.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Correct, Your Honor, but the
falsity standard --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you're -- you used a
state preemption and then say we should apply the same
principles to two federal statutes --
MS. SULLIVAN:  We do, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- but that's a quite
different point.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Here's what I'm saying,
Justice Kennedy.  I'm saying after the NLEA express
preemption provision, a state cannot say that
pomegranate-blueberry-flavored blend of five juices --
which is perfectly consistent with the naming
regulations, as the U.S. agrees.  Why is that?  Because
the naming regulations, Justice Sotomayor, said, you can
name your minority juice, your non-predominant juice in
either of two ways.  You, as a manufacturer, may either
mention a percentage or --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You want us to -- you want
us to write an opinion that said that Congress enacted a
statutory scheme because it intended that no matter how
misleading or how deceptive a label it is, if it passes
the FDA, it cannot -- it -- there can be no liability.
That's what you want us to say?
MS. SULLIVAN:  We do not, Your Honor.  We
would want you to say that what misleading is when it is
defined by FDA in specific regulations pursuant to a
specific statute that specifically seeks national
uniformity, in the sense that the manufacturer picks one
label and doesn't, as the American Beverage Association
brief says at Page 7, create a logistical nightmare that
you have to change your label in response to every jury
verdict.  We're saying that once your --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's suppose there were
a consumer survey, as there was, but -- and -- and say
it was a valid survey.  And overwhelmingly, consumers
said that they are misled, that they thought that they
were getting pure pomegranate, and they were just
astonished to find what they were getting was apple
juice with, what Mr. Waxman told us, a dropper of
blueberry.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose -- suppose the
reality is that consumers are misled.
MS. SULLIVAN:  If I suppose that, Your
Honor, then the proper procedure for a consumer or a
competitor is to go to the FDA and seek FDA's change of
its rulemaking.  Your Honor, in the red addendum -- red
brief addendum at Page 17(a) over to 18(a), you'll see
that in 21 CFR 102.33(d) FDA said, Your juice will not
be misleading if it uses the word "flavored."
And in fact, over on 18(a), if you want to
see the closest thing to an express authorization of our
label here, it's the example that FDA gave on 18(a).  It
said, You can use either flavor or a percentage, and it
won't be misleading.  Why?  Because we don't think that
consumers are quite as unintelligent as POM must think
they are.  They know when something is a favored blend
of five juices, non-min- -- the non-predominant juices
are just a flavor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Don't make me feel bad
because I thought that this was pomegranate juice.
(Laughter.)
MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Kennedy -- Justice
Kennedy, it's pomegranate-blueberry-flavored blend of
five juices.  I've found that oftentimes -- well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He sometimes doesn't read
closely enough.
(Laughter.)
MS. SULLIVAN:  Yeah,
pomegranate-blueberry-flavored blend of five juices.
And the key point here --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do we square this
with Wyeth?
MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wyeth, the FDA actually
approves, looks at the label and says, this one is okay.
Not only is it not misleading, but it complies with all
health requirements, and because the producers of drugs
have the ability to change the label without FDA
approval, there was -- we found no preemptions and no
impossibility.
How is Wyeth any different?  The FDA here --
it's even worse, this case.  The FDA doesn't approve the
labels.  It never looks at them and says they are okay
or not okay unless they decide to enforce the statute.
How is this better than Wyeth?
MS. SULLIVAN:  Two important distinctions,
Your Honor, but let me first disagree with the premise.
It's true that FDA doesn't pre-approve the label, but
they couldn't have gotten closer here, Justice Kennedy,
than solving your difficulty by saying that
ras-cranberry juice, it's okay if you call it
raspberry-and-cranberry-flavored juice drink.  You don't
have to put the percentages in.
So this is -- it's not a preapproval
requirement, but these regulations are very specific.
Justice Sotomayor, Wyeth, as you said, as
this Court said, did not involve an express preemption
provision.  It is the express preemption provision here
that says that Congress wanted nationally uniform
labeling regulations whereby a manufacturer could pick
one label and stick with it.  This is Guyer, not Wyeth.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You assume people would
pick a label and stick with it.  The Lanham Act would --
if a Lanham Act claim is bought, and it's upheld, you
change the label nationally.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Oh, but, Your Honor, that's
one thing if the FDA decides to adapt its rulemaking.
Suppose Justice Ginsberg's consumers or competitors
showed up and said, Excuse me, we don't think
ras-cranberry is clear enough.  Justice Kennedy said it
wasn't.  Please change your rulemaking.
When the FDA issues guidance or changes its
rules or issues a new kind of interpretation, that's one
agency speaking nationally.  What Mr. Waxman wants to do
is invite plaintiffs to walk into every court in the
land under Lanham Act claims and create one jury saying,
I think you should have called it apple-grape juice, and
another saying you should have had the percentage.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Sullivan,  I would like you to
respond to this question:  In the real world, the FDA
has a tremendous amount of things on its plate, and
labels for juices are not really high on its list.  It
has very limited resources.  You are asking us to take
what it has said about juice as blessing this label,
saying it's not misbranding, when its regulations aren't
reviewed by the Court, when there is no private right of
action, and say that that overtakes the Lanham Act.
It's -- it's really very hard to conceive that Congress
would have done that.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Ginsburg, precisely
for the reasons you say, you should affirm here and go
with us in precluding the Lanham Act claims.  And the
reason is that Congress has authorized a very specific
regulatory regime here.  Of course you don't want the
FDA deciding is pomegranate-blueberry or ras-cranberry
clear -- that's why they gave specific regulations.  And
contrary to what Mr. Waxman said, the FDA does not just
have criminal jurisdiction.  It has adjudicatory
jurisdiction.  It has civil authority.  It can issue
warning letters, which, as the amicus brief of
Mr. Friedman points out, are very effective.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the point is that it
is doubtful that FDA has sufficient resources to police
food and beverage labeling.  I think that was the thrust
of Justice Ginsburg's question.  I had the same concern.
And this is relevant because we want to see what the
likely intention of Congress was with reference to these
two statutes.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Kennedy, the U.S.
position is unworkable, as you said before.  And the
U.S. hasn't said that they lack sufficient resources.
What we would respectfully suggest you look at is not
FDA's latest amicus brief through the U.S., but FDA's
authoritative statement about whether its labeling
regulations were being implemented.
In the red brief at Page 7, we cite to the
rulemaking in which the FDA found after the three-year
study -- remember the express preemption provision
couldn't go into force until there was a three-year
study by the IOM.  And if you look at Page 7 of the red
brief, three-quarters of the way down the page, you'll
see FDA in its authoritative statement, irrespective of
its amicus brief here, found that 343(f), the
presentation regulation, and 343(i), the naming
regulation, were being adequately implemented.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that's contrary to its
current position, and I think we have to take it -- the
FDA is -- is -- the government is representing the
current FDA position.
MS. SULLIVAN:  But, Your Honor, you don't
give our deference to an amicus brief when there's an
authoritative prior statement by FDA that these
implementation -- for the very reason you suggest, the
FDA has other things to do.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would that -- without
regard to deference, we don't resurrect the statement
that they no longer support.
MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, Your Honor, they
haven't disavowed that statement.  We would respectfully
suggest that just as it's too late for Mr. Waxman to
change his theory, as you said in Riegel, to a -- we're
enforcing the FDA theory -- and he doesn't purport to do
it here -- it's -- the FDA, it's too late now to say in
an amicus brief that they didn't mean it back in 1993.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think, Ms. Sullivan,
that there are any Lanham suits regarding food labels
that are allowable?
MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  Putting
aside the private enforcement 337(a) problem that
Justice Sotomayor raised before, we believe that Lanham
Act suits are not preempted -- would not be preempted as
state law claims, and, therefore, are not precluded as
Lanham Act claims, if they fall outside the specific
provisions of FDCA that have preemptive force.  So
343(a) -- may I finish, your Honor?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
MS. SULLIVAN:  If there is something that is
not covered -- name, vignette, font, multiplized are
covered.  If there's something else that's not
covered -- and I would refer Your Honor to --
specifically to religious dietary labeling, bottle
container deposit labeling -- those are things that the
FDA said in its rulemaking, based on the Congressional
record, are outside the specific provisions with
preemptive force.  Then, assuming there's no 337
problem, you can have a Lanham Act claim.  All we say is
that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MS. SULLIVAN:  -- the preemption provision
governs here.  Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Waxman, you have
seven minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WAXMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I need to correct a few misstatements by my
colleague, Ms. Sullivan.  First of all, this three-year
study that she's referring to, as we pointed out in our
brief, the IOM and the FDA made absolutely clear
repeatedly in that study that they did not look at FDA's
enforcement capabilities, its enforcement efforts.  It
had -- it simply was a judgment about whether the
specific forbearance regulations that they promulgated,
in fact, adequately accomplished what Congress's
objectives were.
Number two, we -- we are not saying that
this is a misbranded product.  We are not trying to
enforce the FDCA.  And the FD -- and the FDA itself has
made clear, not only in its brief in this case and not
only in its enforcement action in the Nestle case, but
in the Federal Register discussion of the juice naming
regulation, that the fact that the juice may comply --
and here it probably doesn't -- may comply with the
naming convention does not mean that it is misleading.
The FDA said over and over again in that
rulemaking that we strongly caution manufacturers that,
in fact, mere compliance with this does not mean that
the label is misleading and -- and that manufacturers
are under an obligation to ensure that the label is not
misleading.  Now, as to the question of --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Where -- where is that
statement contained?
MR. WAXMAN:  That is in 58 -- the statements
that I'm quoting are in 58 Federal Register, Pages 2900,
2919, and 2920.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Thank you.
MR. WAXMAN:  And also, indeed said,
nonetheless, we encourage manufacturers to name all of
the juices in a multiple juice product specifically
because it was concerned about this.
Now, Ms. Sullivan says, well, you know, not
all Lanham Act claims are preempt -- precluded.  They
wouldn't be precluded if the parallel cognate state law
enforcement of an identical standard wouldn't be
precluded.
This is -- the closest cognate here is
343(a), which provides that a food is misbranded if it
is false -- if the label is false and -- false or
misleading at any particular.  That isn't in this sort
of Swiss cheese exception -- exemption-filled preemption
provision of the NLEA.  That one isn't preempted.  There
is nothing whatsoever that preempts any person from
going into state court and enforcing a state law
provision that recites in haec verba 343(a).
Now, Ms. Sullivan says, okay, we're not
worried here.  The FDA wasn't worried here about health
or safety.  That's not what's going on here.
That is the point.  That is the point.  It's
because there were concerns about health and safety with
this juice naming regulation that they said, in the
exercise of our sovereign enforcement authority, we are
not going to go after you for complying with this naming
convention, because, as they've explained, we don't know
anything about how to protect competitors.  We don't
purport to know what is in the competitive marketplace.
And we aren't about writing regulations under these
criminal provisions.
And Ms. Sullivan is right.  There are civil
enforcement mechanisms, but they're all enforced by
juries.  We aren't going to go this way because this is
not our job.  It's not our expertise.  And yet,
interesting --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Waxman, I  take it that
Ms. Sherry said that the FDA views itself as having a
job beyond health and safety, that they view themselves
as at least -- not thinking about competitors' welfare or
lack thereof, but at least thinking about consumer
understanding of labels.
So if that's the case, is the determination
under the Lanham Act different from the determination
under the FDCA?
MR. WAXMAN:  Very definitely, and for -- for
some of the reasons that this Court discussed in the
Lexmark case, where you were talking about who can sue
under the Lanham Act and who's protected.  And the Court
noted that, of course, consumer confusion itself can be
the engine for a  competitive harm.
But the former is not what the Lanham Act is
about, and the latter, the FDA has made perfectly clear
is not what the FDCA is about.
And interestingly, even with respect to this
naming provision, and, you know, we -- the government
agrees with us far more than it disagrees with us, but
our disagreement about the preclusive effect of their
judgment is important.
You know, they say, okay, we -- we spent a
lot of time on these regulations, and we are entitled to
chevron deference.  And we think they are entitled to
Chevron deference with respect to interpreting the
misbranding provisions that they are in fact -- that
they do enforce.
They're asking as -- their submission here
is not -- not -- not just in an FDA action, enforcement
action in court, will we get chevron deference for our
interpretation of what the meaning of 343(i)(1) is.
But in a Lanham Act case, we get chevron on
steroids deference.  We get to basically keep you of out
of court entire -- you're not even allowed to make that
claim.
That is an astonishing proposition, and it
is one that there is nothing whatsoever in the
legislative history, the language of the statute,
anything at all to indicate that Congress wanted --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Any authority that the FDA
interpretation gets deference is presumed to be correct,
or presumed to be not misleading?  Has there ever been
any scholarship or commentary or cases saying that?
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, certainly not in the
Lanham Act context.  There's been no suggestion that
they have anything whatsoever to say about the Lanham
Act.  Knowing the professoriate, I'm sure there must be
some commentary about whether they do or don't get
chevron deference.  But Ms. Sullivan says that they
don't and the government says that they do.  And there
must be a scholar at least on each side of that
position, but I simply don't know.  I will make one
final point.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If there is a Lanham Act
suit and the regulation is brought forward to prevent
the suit, cannot the party against whom it's brought
forward say the regulation is --
MR. WAXMAN:  We certainly intend to say that
if it becomes relevant, absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it's not on steroids
then.  You can still apply --
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I -- right.  I think that
it doesn't apply at all.  The government would take the
position that it has preclusive authority.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:07, the case in the
