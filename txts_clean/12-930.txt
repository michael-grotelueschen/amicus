CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
now in Case 12-930, Mayorkas v. Cuellar de Osorio.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The Board of Immigration Appeals reasonably
interpreted Section 1153(h)(3) when it ruled that
creation of a new petition by a new petitioner did not
qualify as automatic conversion of an existing petition
to an appropriate family-sponsored category.  That
interpretation is supported by the text and by the
structure of the statutory scheme.
Indeed, it avoids destabilizing that scheme
by displacing waiting aliens, who have long had
qualifying relationships with lawful permanent
residence, and putting ahead of them in line a large
number of adults, aged-out former derivative
beneficiaries, who have only just attained a
relationship with someone who can sponsor a family
member.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But isn't there -- isn't
the effect on the no longer child much more severe?  I
mean, if everybody has to get bumped down a little way,
it'll make a difference of months until they qualify for
a hearing.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Your Honor, I don't accept
the proposition that it would only make a difference of
months, although I know Respondents have argued that.
It depends how many people --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it's not going to
be 27 years.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's not going to be 20
years.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  No, Your Honor.  It won't
be 20 years, but it could be years, and these people in
the F2B line have already been waiting for years to get
up to the front of that line.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about all the time
this one child has been waiting?  It gets no credit for
that?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I think it's mistaken to
think of a derivative beneficiary as waiting in line and
being entitled to credit for waiting in line, for a
couple of different reasons.
First of all, the derivative's rights are,
as the name suggests, completely derivative of the
principal beneficiary's rights.  If the principal
beneficiary never becomes a lawful permanent resident,
never crosses the border into this country, then the
derivative gets nothing for the time that the principal
beneficiary spent waiting in line.
In addition, there are derivative
beneficiaries who, under any understanding of what it
means to wait in line, can't be conceived of as having
waited -- excuse me -- for the time that the principal
beneficiary has waited.  And let me give you an example
of that.
In the F4 line, someone could be waiting in
the F4 line as a principal beneficiary for, say, 15
years, and right as they're getting up to the front of
that line --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's  F4?  What's
F4?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  For those of us who don't
deal with this as much as you do.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I apologize, Your Honor.
F4 is siblings of U.S. citizens.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  So they could be waiting in
the F4 line for 15 years, let's say, as a principal
beneficiary; and then just as they get -- they're
getting up to the front of that line and their priority
date is going to become current, they get married to
somebody; and the person they get married to has a
17-year-old child at that point in time.
That stepchild, that 17-year-old child,
under the definition of child in the statute, will count
as the principal beneficiary's child.  And if, say, a
year later, the principal beneficiary's priority date
becomes current and that principal beneficiary is
entitled to immigrate to the United States and become a
lawful permanent resident, they're going to be able to
bring that 17-year-old -- or, at that point, 18-year-old
stepchild along with them as a derivative beneficiary.
That stepchild did not wait in the line for
the first 15 years that the principal beneficiary was
waiting.  And so that example, I think, shows why, when
you look at a derivative beneficiary, you want to look
at the end of the process, a snapshot in time of when
the principal beneficiary is coming to this country.
And what the statute says is, principal
beneficiary, if -- at the moment you're coming, do you
have a child who would be left behind in another country
if you were to come without them, if so, bring them
along.  But it doesn't make sense to look at a
derivative beneficiary --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you interpret automatic
to include immediate?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think that if -- if
automatically converted, in the context of this statute,
if that's triggered by a particular event, then it has
to happen as a result of that event, yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But your reading of this
statute gives (h)(3) a very, very narrow scope; isn't
that correct?  And I just want to see if I understand
exactly how narrow it is.  It would apply -- first of
all, does it apply to any employment-based or
diversity-based petitions?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  No, Your Honor, it does
not.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  It applies to an
F2A petition filed by a legal permanent resident on
behalf of that person's spouse; right?  And -- and if
that -- if they have a minor child, then the minor child
would be a derivative.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Right.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Benefit sharing.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes.  It also would apply
to a situation where an F2A petition is filed for a
child as the principal beneficiary, and the child ages
out of that status.  But I'd also like to say that it
doesn't actually apply to all aged-out F2A derivative
beneficiaries, so it's, perhaps, even slightly narrower
than Your Honor has described.
It applies to situations where  there can be
automatic conversion of the existing petition and
movement into a new appropriate category without a
change in the petitioner.  And so, for some of the
reasons that I discussed before, regarding stepchildren,
it actually will be the case that some aged-out F2A
derivative beneficiaries --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you give me an idea of
how -- just to follow up with Justice Alito.  Can you --
I don't know if you asked the IRS -- the INS this
question, you may, or something like it.  Let's look at
all of the derivative beneficiaries in the Fs, F1, 2A,
2B, F3, F4.
And for the most part, they're
grandchildren, they would be, or children, sometimes,
nephews and nieces.  And now, think of the set of all
those people who age out.  Okay?  They started out as
children, but it's 15 years later -- what's this thing--
they're now aged out.
Now, think of that set.  It's -- call it
a certain size.  What percent of that set do you think
are accounted for by the F2A people, who are the only
ones on your interpretation that (3) would apply to?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't know what
percentage --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Any idea -- any rough idea?
Because, if you just look at it, one's natural instinct
is just what Justice Alito said.  This is a minuscule
component of a set.  It's much bigger, and therefore,
it's just unlikely that Congress meant (3) to apply to
a -- to a -- to a little molecule, when there's the
whole ocean.
Now, that -- that's the kind of argument that
you're up against, I think, so I wanted to ask you that
empirical question.  If you can give me any idea of the
empirical?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor.  Well,
before I get to the question of the numbers, and I can
give you some numbers, although not perfect numbers,
because of how records are kept in this area.  I'd just
like to say that, keep in mind, that what Congress was
reasonably interpreted to be doing here is picking up on
an existing regulation that was targeted specifically at
this very group that we're talking about.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm going to let you
answer his question, but, yes, they had a regulation, so
why didn't they copy the regulation?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It would have been much,
much simpler to say this is limited to F2A beneficiaries
than to write it the way they did and say this is to
everybody who ages out.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  There are two reasons, I
think, why they didn't copy the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Answer him, and then --
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Okay.  With respect to the
numbers on our -- in our reply brief, on page 18, in the
footnote, we've given the best numbers that we were able
to come up with, and they are not complete numbers,
about people who are aging out every year, for as long
as the State Department's been keeping records about
this, which is not all that long.  And you can see that
there's a series of parentheticals there, with respect
to each year.
The first number in the parenthetical
represents age-out derivatives -- derivatives in the F2A
category; and the second number represents aged-out
derivatives in all family preference categories,
including F2A.  And the numbers for these F2A age-outs
are not tiny; there are thousands of people a year.  In
some years, they are up in the 20 thousands.
And so it is not necessarily a minuscule --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You -- did you ask --
anything that would give me -- that's the total global
picture.  That's the 2,000, 3,000, sometimes 10,000
aging out.  All right.  But -- but the real relevant
thing is if we can get some idea, which seems in the
paper, that your interpretation applies to -- only to a
subset of those people.
And just from reading it, that it's
qualitative reading it, it sounds like a tiny subset of
those people.  Now, we can argue about whether that's
for you or against you.  I think it's against you, but
nonetheless --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You do give the subsets.
It's not just the general, is it?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes.  There's -- I was
going to say, the first number is the F2A -- the
aged-out F2A derivatives.  So --
F2B now.
relevant.
right.
JUSTICE BREYER:
MS. GOLDENBERG:
JUSTICE BREYER:
MS. GOLDENBERG:
That's F2A.  But we want
No, I think F2A is what's
F2A.  You're right.  You're
That's what's covered.  And
this is not a full universe of the numbers.  These are
numbers kept by the State Department, but the State
Department is only responsible for half of the
administration of this program.
There are also people who adjust their
status to lawful permanent resident in the United
States, and those numbers just aren't kept.  We tried to
get them and weren't able to.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So it looks
like it's between 10 percent, and sometimes, it gets it
up to 30 percent --
MS. GOLDENBERG:  It varies, Your Honor.  And
as I say, these numbers aren't perfect, but I think it
gives you a sense of the universe that we're talking
about here, to the best of our ability.
So if I could turn back to Justice
Sotomayor's question about why they didn't just go ahead
and copy the language of the regulation into the statute
and why they didn't just say F2A in the statute?  I
think the reason gets back to what I was discussing
earlier, actually, with Justice Alito, which is that
actually would have been overinclusive, if they had just
said F2A beneficiaries are covered, because there is a
set of F2A derivative beneficiaries who don't benefit
from the language of Section 1153(h)(3), because they
are the child of the petitioner's spouse, but they don't
count as the child of the petitioner, probably for a
stepchild kind of situation, like I was discussing
earlier.  If the stepchild is over 18 at the time of the
marriage, they don't count as a stepparent's child under
the statute.
So there is a tiny corner, here, that would
get carved out.  And actually, Congress did a very good
job in this statute of capturing exactly the universe of
people that was captured under the preexisting
regulation.  The preexisting regulation required there
to be another petition filed by the same petitioner, and
automatic conversion to the appropriate category gets at
exactly that same kind of result.
The other reason I think why Congress might
not have specified F2A in Section 1153(h)(3), in
addition to just its understanding of automatic
conversion as a term of art in this area that was doing
the work that it wanted, is that Section 1153(h)(3) now
functions smoothly, if there's a change in the
family-sponsored categories, which has happened in the
past.
Congress has changed up those categories,
added categories.  And so if, for instance, Congress
were now to add a category for grandchildren of U.S.
citizens, then aged-out F3 beneficiaries, like
Respondents' sons and daughters, could automatically
convert to an appropriate category and Section
1153(h)(3) would work just fine.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose there are two --
suppose there are two lawful permanent residents who are
exactly the same, except that one has a minor child and
one has an adult unmarried child.
So the latter files an F2B petition and gets
in line on a particular date, right?  Then the former,
the lawful permanent resident, who has an unmarried --
who has a minor child, files an F2A petition and gets in
that line.
But then by the time the date comes up, the
child has aged out, and so, now, you would say that
would be converted to an F2B petition.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But the person would be --
the child would be at a much lower point, right, than
the first one?  Why would Congress have wanted that?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't think that's
necessarily true.  It would depend on how the priority
dates were working between when they were coming current
in the different categories.  I do think it's true that
the aged-out F2A individual would go into the middle or
the back of the F2B line, the way that the priority
dates are currently working out.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Right.  And the other one
would be higher up.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, but they would --
yes, I suppose that's true, but the person who ages out
would be keeping the original priority date, so they're
not entitled to more than that.  And the reason Congress
might have wanted to put people into the middle or back
of the F2B line and not right up to the front of the F2B
line, which would be the effect of Respondents'
interpretation --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Oh, okay.  I see.  Thank
you.
MS. GOLDENBERG: -- is that that's extremely
disruptive to the line.  And I would like to spend a few
minutes talking about that because I think it's
critically important here --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Goldenberg, before you
do that, could I just ask you to respond to a sort of
different hypothesis of what Congress was up to here and
tell me what, if anything, you think follows from it?
Assume you think that Congress actually was
not intending this very small category, that Congress
was intending for this to be a pretty wide provision,
but what Congress was -- it was laboring under a
misapprehension.  I mean, it thought that you could do
this kind of automatic conversion with respect to all of
these people, and it turns out Congress was just utterly
wrong on that.
So -- but Congress includes this language
about automatic conversion.  So what do I do if I
basically have a hunch that that's what Congress was
thinking, but, yet, the language that it adopted talks
about automatic conversion, which is impossible for many
of this category.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Right.  I think it's the
language that's on the face of the statute that's
important, and it's ambiguous for the very reason that
you just gave, which is that there are a lot of people
for whom automatic conversion to the appropriate
category just isn't going to work.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you mean we can't
correct congressional mistakes?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  No, but I think, in a
situation where the language is ambiguous, the Agency is
entitled to deference, and deference is particularly
appropriate in this kind of circumstance.  This Court
has said, before, that deference is particularly
appropriate in immigration contexts, and I think, if any
immigration context is appropriate for it, it's this one
because very delicate lines have to be drawn here.
If someone is helped, someone else is hurt.
And it's something where you have to step very
carefully.  Otherwise, there is going to be real
destabilization of the system.
And just before I turn to that, let me just
say one more thing about what Congress was thinking.  To
the extent that you look at the legislative history
here, there is no indication that Congress was thinking
that this would sweep broadly.  In fact, there are many
statements on the floor about not wanting to displace
people who are waiting in line, which would cut in the
other direction.
So the destabilization that would occur as a
result of Respondents' interpretation would be many
people -- and we can't quantify exactly how many, but we
have reason to think that the number is quite large --
would come pouring into, in most cases, the very front
of the F2B line and would hold it up for very
significant periods of time and perhaps even freeze that
line altogether.
Keep in mind that, in that line, there are
only 26,250 visas available per year -- nothing changes
that -- and per country, there are only about 1,800
visas available per year.  So if you envision, say,
3,600 people from one country coming into the front of
the F2B line, every single person in that line -- that's
at least hundreds of thousands of people, based on State
Department numbers, and more than that probably, if you
had the other numbers, is going to wait for two
additional years.  And if there are more people who come
into the front of the line, all those people are going
to wait longer.
And the equities here are such that the
people who are going to be pushed back really have
entitlement to stay where they are, and that's for this
reason:  The people coming into the front of the line,
the aged-out F3 and F4 derivative beneficiaries, have
only just, just moments before this has happened,
obtained some kind of qualifying relationship with the
U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident that would
entitle them to family-sponsored immigration.
Prior to their parent, the principal
beneficiary, becoming a lawful permanent resident, they
were just the nieces, nephews, grandchildren, of
citizens and --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So that -- that's an
expectation argument?  I mean, I'm not trying to put
words in your mouth, but is that the point you're
making?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think the idea is
that the people who are going to be pushed have had
long-time relationships with a lawful permanent
resident, entitling them directly to family-sponsored
immigration.  They have been waiting in the F2B line,
maybe for years.
They've been separated from their parents
for that entire period of time, most likely.  And what
Respondents' position would mean would be that these
aged-out F3 and F4 derivative beneficiaries would
basically experience no period of separation from their
parents because they would --
JUSTICE BREYER:  We don't have numbers on
separation from parents.  We do know that these people,
the ones that would be caught on the broad
interpretation, have also been waiting for years and
years and years and years.  They've all been waiting for
years and years and years and years, and it becomes hard
to choose among them.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I do think that there
are sympathetic stories on both sides, but --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You can find sympathetic
stories all over the place, and I mean -- all right.  Go
ahead.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  For the reason I gave
earlier, though, I don't think it's right to think of
derivative beneficiaries as, themselves, waiting in
line.  I really do think that that's the wrong way to --
to look at the problem in this case.
The reason that aged-out F2A derivative
beneficiaries get the benefit of Section 1153(h)(3) is
not that they've been waiting in line.  It's that they,
themselves, have a relationship to a lawful permanent
resident, that either did entitle them or would entitle
them to be a principal beneficiary in their own right.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But is your real quarrel
here with -- with the idea of an appropriate category or
with the automatic conversion?  On the Respondents'
view, why isn't there an automatic conversion?  Because
they say that, as soon as the person ages out, they can
be moved into -- into another category.  That sounds
like it's automatic.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I do think you have to look
at the phrase as a whole, but I also don't think that
that's what Respondents are arguing.  They are arguing
that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why isn't it
automatic?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think it's not
automatic because at the moment -- let me step back and
say I think there are two different problems with
Respondents' position.  One is the question of whether
you can ever have automatic conversion to an appropriate
category of an existing petition, when you're subbing in
someone new as the petitioner.  So that's one issue.
And then there's a separate issue --
JUSTICE ALITO:  But automatic just means
something occurs without anybody having to initiate the
change.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  That's true.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So why isn't there --
why isn't it automatic here?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think that -- with
respect to the issue that I was just talking about,
which is the question of whether you can ever convert a
petition to -- make a petition by its -- something
that's by a new petitioner.  There, there is some action
that is required. Do you have to go to the new
petitioner, the parent, and say, would you like to
petition?  Do you have to check that person?
Now, keep in mind, they've never been
checked at the beginning of this process when petitions
are evaluated and approved, to see if they qualify to be
a petitioner.  For instance, to be a petitioner, you
can't have committed certain crimes against minors.  And
that will never have happened here.
So if you have to stop and do that check, at
that stage as well, then it's starting to look a lot
less automatic.  Then there's a separate question, as I
say, even if you did think that the statute could
unambiguously be read to say that you can take a
petition by someone's grandparent and make it into a
petition by someone's parent, there's a separate timing
question that the parties are disputing here as well and
that the board ruled on in its decision in Wang, and
that is, what is the moment when automatic conversion is
supposed to take place?
Respondents' argument is that it's supposed
to take place at whatever time the derivative
beneficiary is interviewed, essentially at the very end
of the process, a consular interview or an adjustment of
status interview or evaluation, and that that's when
automatic conversion ought to happen.
But what the board said, and I think quite
recently, is something different, which is the statute
gives you a date -- Section 1153(h)(1) gives you a date
as of which you are supposed to evaluate the derivative
beneficiary's age.
And that's the date that the visa number
becomes available to a parent.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I understand that argument,
but that's not the argument that Wang made, is it?  Wang
suggested that if the -- the appropriate date was at the
very date of aging out, so -- so it seems as though you
shouldn't be entitled to Chevron deference on that
question, given what Wang said about it.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't think that's true,
Your Honor.  I think, as I read Wang in any event, that
it says, on page 33, you get automatic conversion if the
beneficiary is 21 years or older pursuant to (h)(1), and
then later, in the decision on page 35, it talks about
the moment the beneficiary aged out.
But, that, I take it to be referring back to
the (h)(1) determination that's been made.  So it's aged
out, not biologically in the sense of turning 21 and
celebrating your 21st birthday, but becoming 21 -- over
21 -- 21 or over, under (h)(1), as of that date that the
visa number becomes available to the parent.
I think that's how Wang is best interpreted.
There may be separate questions about whether people are
entitled to the protections of (h)(1), but those aren't
being raised in this case, and that's not something that
Wang itself ruled on.
And so I do think that there's a reasonable
reading of the statute that says -- getting back to the
question of automatically, the moment -- the key moment
is the moment that you're evaluating derivative
beneficiary's age as of.  And as of that date, they're
either under 21 and they can be treated as a child for
the rest of the process, or they're 21 or over, and you
got to figure out what can you do with them.
Can they be automatically converted to an
appropriate category or can they not?  And if not, then
they're out of luck.  And that is a way of reading the
statute that makes it a very smooth movement from one
category to another without any kind of gap in
eligibility.
And it's a reasonable reading of the
statute.  So as I say, I think Respondents really do
have two --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What do we do with a
reasonable reading of the statute?  I looked at the
board's opinion here, and it seems to me, in the two
paragraphs just prior to Section 5, at the end of
Section 4, they have as a critical step in their -- in
reaching their conclusion, their belief that the
legislative record demonstrates a clear concern on the
part of Congress to ameliorate the delays associating
with the process of the visa processing.
And they say the same thing in the paragraph
just above that.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So that's what they think
this statute is about.  But that statute -- that problem
is taken care of in (1)(b).  And so the question would
be, if that problem, which subtracts all the days that
there was a processing delay, is taken care of on
(1)(b), they can't be right, that that was the purpose
of 3.
So unless you can say to me how that could
possibly be right, that reasoning, then what we should
do, I guess, if we think that you have authority in the
government to interpret this minor part of the statute,
which I do, is generate.  Send it back.  And -- and
maybe give them -- say you ought to do this again
because the reason you gave is not good.
Or why not?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't think there's a
problem with the reason they gave, and I would like to
explain why, but even if there were a problem with the
reason they gave, I don't think that it would
appropriate to send it back.  And let me talk about each
of those.
With respect to the reasoning on the
legislative history, the way that I read the board
decision is totally consistent with my own reading of
legislative history, which is to say that Congress'
overwhelming concern and the thing that Congress talked
about, by far, the most in the fairly sparse legislative
history here, there's no pertinent report, really, there
are just a couple of days of debate.
And the thing that Congress talked about the
most was the administrative delays.  That was Congress'
overarching concern.  And Congress didn't really talk
about (h)(3).  They didn't really say what they were
doing there.  They didn't really say what they were
getting up to.  And so I think, under those
circumstances, the board is reasonable in saying it
makes sense to think that what Congress was doing was
not some kind of big change and destabilization of the
whole immigrant visa system, in the way that I described
earlier.
It was doing something pretty small.  And it
was taking an existing regulation and putting it into
the statute.  And by doing that, it could be certain
that it wasn't going to cause disruption.  And it wasn't
going to upset --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That is strange because
I look at (h)(3), which talks about automatic conversion
of battered spouses, of widowed spouses, and I think,
under your reading, you're basically saying Congress was
not intending to let those people jump the line.
Am I correct.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because you have to
change names?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  No.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, there's automatic --
MS. GOLDENBERG:  There -- there is automatic
conversion for self-petitioners and their derivatives.
It's provided for in a provision that preexisted the
Child Status Protection Act, and a very complete and
total age-out protection is provided in that provision --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why did Congress need
to add (h) -- (h)(4), using exactly the same language
that it used for (h)(3)?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, Congress --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That they -- that they
were entitled to the same benefits of automatic
conversion as (h)(3)?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Congress added (h)(4) a
couple of years after the Child Status Protection Act, I
think, basically, just to ensure that battered women,
people who are subject to abuse, could get whatever
benefit the Child Status Protection Act offered them,
even though they already had this other very good
protection that I'm talking about against aging out, in
Section 1154(a)(1)(d)(1), (1) and (3).
But in addition, it is possible to envision
a situation where a self-petitioner could qualify under
Section 1153(h)(3).  I don't know that anyone would ever
go that route because they have this other provision
that they can rely on.  But if you think of a
self-petitioner who is the child of an abuser that's --
like an F2A --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you can have
automatic --
MS. GOLDBERG:  Exactly.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You can have automatic
conversion only in the situations that give you other --
other statutes.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Exactly.  If I could
reserve the remainder of my time?
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Fleming.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY MARK C. FLEMING
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FLEMING:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The government began at step 2 of Chevron,
but I would submit that this case can and should be
resolved at step 1.  The government is asking this Court
to read the statute in a highly disfavored way, such
that it is not harmonious, but at war with itself, and
nothing in the language requires that.  In fact, I would
recommend that the Court turn to the back page of the
government's brief, where the statute is actually set
forth.
And we can see that provision (h)(3)
consists of one sentence, and that sentence consists of
two parts, separated by a comma.  Before the comma, the
language sets forth one and only one eligibility
criterion.  After the comma, the language sets forth two
things that shall be done if the eligibility criterion
is satisfied.
Now, importantly, the government does not
contend that there is any ambiguity in the language
before the comma.  Everyone agrees that it contemplates
and includes all derivative beneficiaries.  There's no
dispute about that.  And a bedrock rule at the step 1
inquiry is that the Court reads the statute as a
harmonious whole.
That goes double when we're talking about a
single sentence.  So if there is a possible reading of
this sentence that is harmonious with the clear opening
clause that applies to all derivative beneficiaries
under step 1 of Chevron.  That is the reading the Court
gives to the statute.
It's especially important here because the
precise question at issue in this case is a question of
eligibility and scope.  Who gets the benefit of the two
benefits set forth -- the two duties set forth by the
shalls in the language after the comma?  And Congress
spoke to that directly in the language before the comma,
all derivative beneficiaries who have gone through the
(h)(1) formula and whose age is determined to be over
21.
Now, the government's claim of ambiguity
here depends on asking the Court to read one of the
benefits after the comma, automatic conversion, in such
a narrow and limited way, a way not required by the
plain language, a way that even the BIA actually did not
adopt, but such that it is incompatible with the broad
scope set forth before the comma.
The Court should be very suspicious of that
reading because it is exactly the contrary of the
traditional tool of statutory construction going back to
Brown & Williamson and FTC v. Mandel that says the Court
reads a statute holistically as a harmonious whole.
For the government's argument to work, the
Court would have to be satisfied that we were in a
situation like National Association of Home Builders v.
Defenders of Wildlife, which is the only case that they
cite for their ambiguity claim, but there, the Court
faced two different statutes and acted at different
times that were clearly contradictory.
You could not comply with both of them at
the same time.  You had to pick one or other the other.
And in that context, this Court said that opens the door
to Agency interpretation.
So in order for the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under your view, does
automatic conversion cover someone who has to file a
new petition?
MR. FLEMING:  Automatic conversion does not
require the filing of a new petition.  It obviates a new
piece of paper.  That is the purpose.  When the board
addressed what conversion --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the way this works, you
don't have to file a new petition?
MR. FLEMING:  That's common ground between
us.  Automatic conversion means that the old petition is
deemed to have been approved in a different category.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But under -- under her
theory, the -- the petition is -- is still coming from
the same person.  Under yours, it would be coming from a
different person.  How can you -- how can you even know
that that person now wants this -- this -- this new
adult to come in, much less go ahead without a petition
from that person?
MR. FLEMING:  Well, a couple of points on
that, Justice Scalia.
First of all, if in the highly hypothetical
situation, that you have a parent who has immigrated and
does not want an aged-out child to come and join them in
the United States, then it is easy for the parent -- the
lawful permanent resident parent to withdraw a petition.
Also, the child cannot immigrate.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You’re going to file a petition in
that person's name, without that person's consent?
MR. FLEMING:  Well, the immigration -- the
ultimate moment of immigration, when the child comes in,
cannot happen without the parent's consent.  The parent,
under a provision that the government cites --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you're saying that this
automatically gives the consent of that parent?
MR. FLEMING:  No, I'm not saying that,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you must be if it can
automatically convert.
MR. FLEMING:  The conversion can happen to a
petition in the F2B category, but in order for a visa
actually to be given and for the child to immigrate,
the -- first of all, the child would have to provide
proof the parent is, in fact, a permanent resident, and
would also have to provide an affidavit of support,
under a provision that the government cites in its reply
brief, agreeing to support the child, so that he or she
does not become a public charge.
That can't happen without the consent of the
petitioner.  So if there ever were a situation --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.
MR. FLEMING:  I'm sorry, Justice Kagan.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Please.
MR. FLEMING:  Well, I was just going to
finish the thought.  If there ever were to be a highly
hypothetical situation, where the converted petition put
into the position of petitioner someone who did not want
the child to come in, there are plenty of off-ramps that
that petitioner can take, in order to avoid that
outcome.  So that is not an impediment to our argument
at all.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  In the usual case, a
petitioner has to show a bunch of things, right?  You
have to come in and say, I'm a legal permanent resident,
and -- you know, I file an affidavit of support and show
that you haven't committed any offenses against minors
and all of this stuff, right?
So -- but you're suggesting that we can just
ignore all of those requirements that usually have to be
shown at the threshold for a petition to be accepted;
isn't that right?
MR. FLEMING:  That's not right at all,
Justice Kagan, certainly not that they have to be
ignored.  There is an adjudicated petition on file by
the U.S. citizen relative, but in order for the child to
immigrate, the -- the new petitioner -- the lawful
permanent resident parent, has to meet all those
requirements, which are assessed at the moment that the
child's visa application is adjudicated.
That is also when the determination of the
age happens under the child's status for protection.
That's where that conversion happens.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that for F2A children
as well?
MR. FLEMING:  I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  These steps, are they
applied to F2A?
MR. FLEMING:  Derivatives -- who age out?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes -- not derivatives.
I'm talking about the children of spouses.
MR. FLEMING:  Yes, Justice.  The answer is,
yes, Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Everything happens at
visa issuance moment?
MR. FLEMING:  The visa -- the visa
application stage -- the officer who is adjudicating the visa
application has to ensure the qualifications of the
petitioner, to make sure they actually are a U.S.
citizen or permanent resident entitled to petition, and
the qualifications of the beneficiary, to make sure that
they have met all of the requirements.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Direct -- direct
or derivative?
MR. FLEMING:  Yes.  Derivative or principal
inside the United States or outside of the United
States.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So you're saying -- you're
saying that these things would happen -- do I understand
you correctly, these things -- or most of these same
things would happen in the cases in which the government
says there is automatic conversion?
MR. FLEMING:  Most certainly, Justice Alito.
Yes, that is exactly right.  And the -- the issue of
time -- I mean, I think maybe it's worth backing up and
talking about how we think automatic conversion is
supposed to function.
What happens is, you have the petition
originally filed, it gets approved, and then they wait
until the visa number becomes current, and then they
each, each beneficiary, has to file a visa application,
which gets adjudicated.  Now, that could be adjudicated
in one of two ways, depending on whether the
beneficiaries in the United States or outside.
Notably, if the beneficiaries are inside the
United States, they go through adjustment of status, and
there is no claim on the government side that there's
any obstacle to automatic conversion at that point.  Why
is that?  Because they both go in at the same time,
parent and child.
The officer always adjudicates the principal
beneficiary's file first.  It will approve the
application, and then the parent becomes a lawful
permanent resident on the spot.
And then nothing prevents the officer from
looking at the child and saying, while I'm doing the
(h)(1) calculation, your age turns out to be over 21
under this formula.  Nonetheless, I can treat your
petition as automatically converting to F2B because you
are the adult son or daughter of a newly minted lawful
permanent resident parent, who's sitting right here.
No difficulty at all.  Certainly no
impossibility.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fleming, to accept that
argument, don't you have to accept your understanding of
what the appropriate date is?  I mean, let's suppose
that the government is right, that the date is the one
that's actually specified in the statute, which says the
date on which an immigrant visa number becomes
available.
At that date, the parent is not even going
to be a legal permanent resident; isn't that right?
MR. FLEMING:  Two answers to that, Justice
Kagan.  First of all, your answer to Ms. Goldenberg was
completely right, which is that is not the approach that
the Board of Immigration Appeals took in Wang.  The
board thought, wrongly, and the government now does not
even try to defend it, that the conversion had to
happen, if at all, at the date that the -- at the moment
that the beneficiary aged out.
That's what they say.  They say, we  look to see
which category the petition converted to at the moment
the beneficiary aged out.  That's on Page 35.  They
tried to defend that in front of --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But let's assume that this
is the right date, the one that's actually specified in
the statute.  Can you win if that's the right date?
MR. FLEMING:  It is -- well, we don't think
that is the right date.  It's a --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I know, but can you win if
it is the right date?
MR. FLEMING:  Well, I think, at that point,
the question then becomes, does the conversion have to
happen immediately at that time, or as long as it's
converted at some point in the future, are we still
interpreting the statute in a harmonious way?  It
automatically doesn't have to mean immediately.
Now, we think it can mean immediately, if
that's how the Court chooses to interpret it, and still
win, because we think the determination happens when the
adjudication happens, which is when, under their current
procedures, they do the age calculations.
But even if the Court disagrees with me on
that and thinks that the statute requires the
determination to happen sooner, all that means is, at
some point after the determination, the petition shall
be converted; but that doesn't mean it has to be done
right at the time of the determination.
I'd like to back up, though, and take on the
premise of the question, which is that (h)(1) somehow
says that the conversion in (h)(3) has to happen on the
date that the visa becomes available because that's not
what the statute says.
H(3) does not say that the conversion has to
happen on that date.  It could have said that.  There
are regulations in 204.2(i) that specify when the
conversion happens as of a particular time or upon a
particular occurrence.  Congress could have taken
language like that and put it into (h)(3).  It didn't.
All that (h)(1) is doing is setting out the
particular formula that gets applied to determine the
age of the derivative beneficiary for purposes of
Subsection (d), and it sets it out by having two -- by
setting out two numbers that get subtracted.
First number is in (h)(1)(a).  The second
number is in (h)(1)(b).  And the first number is the age
of the child on the date the visa became available, and
that is reduced by the number in (b), which is the
number of days that the petition was pending.
Nothing in (h)(1) says, you have to do this
calculation at a particular time.  It just says, when
you do this calculation, here are the numbers you use.
But the determination itself is a matter of Agency
procedure, and under their current procedures, it's not
disputed what happens -- this happens at the time after
the visa application has been filed, and it is ready for
adjudication when the officer sits down, whether it's a
State Department consular officer outside the country or
a CIS officer in the country, sits down with the
applicant and makes sure that all the eligibility
criteria are met, including this one.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But how does -- how -- can
I try an example?  Because I find it easier.
MR. FLEMING:  Of course, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Imagine Steven
is a citizen.  His brother Charles is not.  So under
4 -- and Charles has a son, Joseph, who is not.  That
will help you think about it.
All right.  So we're under F4.  Steven files
a petition.  The beneficiary is Charles.  Charles has a
minor son, Joseph.  Visa is granted, et cetera, for --
not visa -- you know, he's given -- everything is in
order, and now, Charles has to wait about ten years or
so.
By the time he gets -- at the time his
number becomes current -- the number becomes available
for the alien, namely for Charles, at that moment, we
calculate Joseph's age, and it's 24.
All right.  So your idea is that Charles is
current.  Everything is fine.  He goes to the port or
the office, wherever he's supposed to go, and he brings
Joseph with him.
At that point, Joseph, since he's no longer
a child, has to come in under another category, and that
category is going to be, I guess, 2B because Charles
will be now an LPR, and Joseph will be unmarried over
21, right?
Am I right so far?
MR. MITCHELL:  I'm uncomfortable referring
to Your Honor by your first name or your brother by his
first name.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  This is an imaginary -- he
spells it with a V.
MR. FLEMING:  But Your Honor has it right --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, if I have it
right --
MR. FLEMING:  With one tweak, which is I
think you're positing that your brother and his son are
outside the country, not going through adjustment of
status.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. FLEMING:  -- where the situation is a
bit different because then --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.
MR. FLEMING:  -- your brother would become a
permanent resident immediately.  There's no problem
going to a port.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
MR. FLEMING:  But for consular processing, I
think what would happen is when you go to the consular
office --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. FLEMING:  -- Judge Breyer's application
would be accepted and the calculation would be done for
the son, and it would be -- all right --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now the --
MR. FLEMING:  You now no longer qualify as a
derivative because you are 24.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But there is
one thing missing.  Charles has not filed a petition for
Joseph.  So what do we do about that?
MR. FLEMING:  What happens then is what can
happen already under the Agency procedures, which is
they deny Joseph's application without prejudice to
reapplication within a year, which they can do.  They do
it already.
Judge Breyer immigrates to the United
States.  He goes up to the port.  He is admitted as a
lawful permanent resident, and the moment that happens
and the moment Joseph gets proof of that happening, he
goes back into the consulate and says, all right --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And doesn't -- doesn't
Charles, as a lawful permanent resident, have to file a
piece of paper called the petition --
MR. FLEMING:  No.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in which Joseph is named
primary beneficiary?
MR. FLEMING:  I mean, we have two arguments
on this.  Our principal position is no, because, at that
point, there can be automatic conversion from Your
Honor's petition --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. FLEMING:  -- with respect to -- to an
F2B petition on --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But there is no --there is
no F2B petition because Charles never filed it.
MR. FLEMING:  Well, that -- but that's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, yes; right.
MR. FLEMING:  He -- you don't need to a
piece -- that's what automatic conversion is--
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what I want to know.
You don't need --
MR. MITCHELL:  It means that you don't need
to file a piece of paper.
JUSTICE BREYER:  We do all this, and --
MR. FLEMING:  It's done constructively, and
that's what automatic conversion is.  The petition is
deemed as though it had been filed for purposes of a
different category, and even in the situations where the
government agrees it applies, the F2A case, not only the
category changes, the principal beneficiary changes.
Because the original F2A position was for a
spouse, it converts to an F2B petition for the child --
or the aged-out child.  There is no reason -- now, the
government asserts that there's something in the nature
of the word "conversion" that makes it impossible for
the petitioner to change, that that is somehow a
barrier.  Now, there's no reason to think that that's
the case.
First of all, the BIA never said that that
was the case.  When the BIA talks about the meaning of
conversion in the Wang opinion, it says the conversion
is used when, quote, "a visa petition converts from one
visa category to another" -- not a problem here -- "and
the beneficiary of that petition then falls within a new
classification without the need to file a new visa
petition."
Nothing about the identity of the
petitioner, and conversion just means a transformation.
There's no reason that a change, which can already, the
government agrees, involve a change to a different
category for a different principal beneficiary, can't
also involve a new -- a change in the petitioner.
Conversion isn't defined in the Act's
glossary.  The INA has a detailed glossary in Section
1101.  Conversion isn't given a special meaning.  The
identity of the petitioner is not mentioned in (h)(3) at
all, unlike the preexisting regulation, Justice
Sotomayor, which clearly did say that -- that a new
petition has to be filed and it has to be filed by the
same petitioner.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If I understand you, the --
the parent will be deemed to have filed a petition for
admission of this now-adult, right?
MR. FLEMING:  That is correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- but the parent can
withdraw that petition?
MR. FLEMING:  If he or she would ever wish
to do so, yes.  And the child cannot immigrate without
the parent taking additional steps, most notably, the
filing of an affidavit --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All of this flows from the
word "automatic"?
MR. FLEMING:  From the phrase "automatic
conversion," yes.  And the fact that Congress in the
opening clause, before the comma of this provision, made
very clear that it is to apply to all derivative
beneficiaries because it says, if you go through the
calculation of (h)(1), which everyone agrees -- even the
vacated panel opinion of the Ninth Circuit agreed with
this, and even the government agrees, that (h)(1)
applies to all derivative beneficiaries.
And if you go through that calculation and
your age is still over 21 when you come through it, then
your petition shall automatically be converted to the
appropriate category, and if, for some reason, Justice
Scalia, the parent has a problem with that, there are
plenty of ways for the parent to stop the immigration of
the child, although I've never heard of a situation
where that might actually happen.
One thing I would like to back up to, just
because we are at Chevron step 1, and one of the issues
that this Court indicated in Brown and Williamson is
important for that -- for that analysis, is a modicum of
common sense as to the manner in which Congress would
have been likely to delegate this particular question to
the Agency.
The question here isn't some interstitial
matter or some filling of a gap that Congress is not
likely to have turned its mind to.  It is a foundational
question, who gets the benefit of these mandates after
the comma, the automatic conversion and the retention of
priority dates.
It's unlikely that Congress didn't think
about something as basic as that; and if they did mean
to delegate that to the Board of Immigration Appeals,
it's a very strange way of doing it because --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Based on -- another
understanding of Chevron is, sometimes, Congress writes
confusing statutes that point in two different
directions at once, and then there's a choice.  Does the
Court make the best of it, or does the Agency make the
best of it?
And the Agency knows a lot about the subject
matter, and especially this Agency, and so irrespective
of whether Congress meant to delegate something in some
very self-conscious way, this is a confusing statute,
it's a kind of a muddle.  The -- the Agency gets to do
it.
MR. FLEMING:  I would certainly agree,
Justice Kagan, as a general matter, that the immigration
law is confusing, but I don't think it's any more
confusing than other statutes, where this Court worked
through and found the -- the ultimate provision at issue
to be clear on the question at issue.
And here, the question is who gets the
benefit of it?  And we have an opening clause that is
undisputed in its meaning, that covers all derivative
beneficiaries.  We also have benefits, automatic,
conversion and retention priority date, that clearly can
be applied -- possibly, not only possibly, but easily --
to the full scope set out in the clause before the
comma.
And we have an omission, presumably
deliberate, of specific limitations not only in the
regulations, but also in the V visa provision, which we
cite, which specifically call out the very group that
the government now is trying to favor.  If Congress had
meant to say, this only goes to F2A beneficiaries, it
had two very easy example of how to do that.
It deliberately, presumably, chose not to do
that.  As the Fifth Circuit observed and as the
questioning earlier in the argument indicated, if all
that the Congress was trying to do here was codify an
existing regulation, it was very easy for them to say
so, but this is a ameliorative provision.  Even the BIA
acknowledged that.
They were trying to solve a problem that
happened when people had been waiting for a long period
of time, and not just the beneficiary, but also the --
just not the derivative beneficiary, but also the
principal beneficiary.
I mean, the lead Respondent in this case,
Rosario Cuellar de Osorio, had been waiting a long time
to emigrate with her husband and her family, and then
when the time came, she was told, you can all go, except
Melvin; because he happened to turn 21 four months
before the visa number became available.  Congress
recognized that was a problem and tried to fix it.  And
they did fix it, clearly.
That is the common-sense reading of this
provision, that the clear language up front, before the
comma, sets out the scope, and that Congress meant the
remainder of the provision to be read consistently,
harmoniously, and holistically, as this Court has said
it always does, with that scope, not to read it in
tension -- in some kind of irretrievable hostility with
itself, which is the argument that the government needs
to convince this Court of in order to even get to step
2.
Now, of course, we do have an alternative
argument, with -- which is -- you know, independent,
even if this Court were to agree that our Respondents'
children are not entitled to automatic conversion,
although we think they clearly are, then, at the very
least, there is another way to read the statute
harmoniously, which is that they're entitled to the
retention of priority date.  That is the main benefit
that is provided by (h)(3).
It's the benefit that is mentioned in the
inactive title of the statute, and it's all that's
needed to affirm the judgment here.
And, again, remember the standard.  All
we -- all we need to show, for our purposes, to affirm
the court of appeals, is that the language after the
comma can be read in a way that is consistent with the
language before the comma that sets out the broad scope
of the provision.  It's at least possible to read the
retention language as an independent benefit.
Congress repeated the word "shall," meaning
that it is an independent mandate.  The object of the
mandate is different.  It is the alien who retains the
priority date, whereas it's the alien's petition that is
converted.  And we know from Ron Pair that a statute
that says that there is a duty to do A and a duty to do
B can be at least read reasonably and possibly --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, this is all upside
down.  I thought it's the Agency that we deferred to.
If it can be read in the way the Agency wants, we affirm
the Agency's position.
MR. FLEMING:  That is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying that that's
not true, that if it can be read the way the court of
appeals would like it to be read, we must affirm the
court of appeals on it.
MR. FLEMING:  This is a very important
question, Justice Scalia.  I want to make sure --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It sure is.  I never
heard --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I never heard of that
proposition.
MR. FLEMING:  What I have been -- what I
have been trying to note is the fact that what we're
talking about here is a statute that the government is
trying to argue is hopelessly internally inconsistent.
That is a step 1 argument that we think gets rejected at
step 1 because the statute can be read holistically and
harmoniously.
And if there is any possible reading -- this
is the language of Brown and Williamson and FTC versus
Mandel -- if the benefits after the comma can be read in
a way that is consistent with the broad scope that
Congress said this statute is to apply to, that is the
reading to be given.
Now, this --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That would depend entirely
upon how much weight you want to give to the word
"automatically."  I frankly find it hard to think that
all the things that you say are going to happen flow
from the word "automatic."  And once you have a more
narrow view of automatically, it isn't -- your holistic
argument does not carry the day, and you're left with an
ambiguity that, it seems to me, we would defer to the
Agency on, not -- not to the Ninth Circuit.
MR. FLEMING:  This -- I'm not seeking
deference to the Ninth Circuit by any means, Justice
Scalia.  I'm seeking deference to Congress and its plain
language.  And that's precisely the point.
Now, going back to "automatic," since Your
Honor wanted to focus on that, I mean, "automatic" just
means it happens without any further interaction by
the -- by the alien.  All it means in the regulations is
that the Agency regards the petition as being approved
in a different category.  And that certainly can happen
in our case.
The government doesn't actually dispute that
it happens in the adjustment of status context.  They
just argue that, somehow, the difference in petitioner
is relevant.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose -- suppose
everybody knows that, for the group that's covered by
the Ninth Circuit's opinion, the nephews, that there's
going to be a 3 or 4-year wait.  Doesn't a new petition
have to be filed, so that BIA knows that this person's
in line?
MR. FLEMING:  What -- what fundamentally
happens is that the -- the petition gets filed by the
U.S. citizen relative, and then, after it's approved,
just by basically checking that the relative is entitled
to file that petition, then everybody awaits until the
petition -- until the priority date of the -- of the
beneficiary becomes current, according to the State
Department lines.
It's not as though there's a constantly
re-updating, to see if anyone has aged out or anyone has
naturalized or anyone's gotten married or anything like
that.
If somebody wants to do that, then,
obviously, they can send something in.  But it's not as
though there is a continuous updating of the file, until
the time comes when a visa application is submitted.
And when a visa application is submitted, then it is
adjudicated, and then all of these things are checked,
and the determination of age under age one happens, and
that is the point where the automatic conversion is
going to happen.
And as long as that happens while the parent
is already a lawful permanent resident, there is no
obstacle to conversion and no obstacle to it being
automatic because nothing else needs to be done.  All
that has to happen is the officer has to regard it as
having been approved in the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Can I ask you a quick
question --
MR. FLEMING:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- about your alternative
argument, with you and Justice Scalia.  I take it your
argument is, look at the words; the part before the
comma defines a group, and that group is not in dispute.
It's all the F derivatives.
MR. FLEMING:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Then look at
the first part.  It says, the petition shall
automatically be converted.
MR. FLEMING:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  See, if I lose on that,
then look at the second part.  It says, the alien shall
retain the original priority date.  And you say, as to
that, that has an independent life.
MR. FLEMING:  That's -- that is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the B.  So it's
either A or B.  And we think we win on A and B, but if
not, we at least win on B.  Now, has the Agency ever
expressed a view in respect to whether you are right or
wrong about your independent B?
MR. FLEMING:  I don't think so.  The
government may think so, but I don't --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  So wouldn't the right
thing to do there be, in respect to B, send it back to
the Agency so that they can express a view in respect to
that?
MR. FLEMING:  I think that's certainly --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How can you possibly
qualify for B, without qualifying for A?  How can you
retain your original priority if you have not been
converted to another category?
MR. FLEMING:  The way the government --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's quite impossible.
The two are obviously conjunctive and not dysjunctive.
MR. FLEMING:  The way the government has
been applying this provision since its enactment, for
over 10 years, Justice Scalia, has been to require
everybody, even the people -- the F2A beneficiaries whom
the government is now contending are entitled to
automatic conversion, it has required them to file to
get a new petition filed.  It has been denying automatic
conversion to everybody, and it did that up through the
filing of our Red Brief.
It was only after we pointed this out, a
week before the government filed its reply brief in this
Court, CIS issued new guidance saying, okay,
henceforward, you don't need to file a new petition
anymore.  As far as I know, for consular processing
cases, they are still doing it the old way.  You still
cannot get automatic conversion, but you do get to
retain your priority date.
They are clearly implementable as separate
benefits.  That is how this has been done over the last
10 or 11 years, until the government came time to file
its brief -- its reply brief in this Court.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, all that proves is
that you need either automatic conversion or the filing
of a separate petition.  But you obviously need either
one or the other of those two --
MR. FLEMING:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- before the -- the B
part, "the alien shall retain the original priority,"
makes any sense.
MR. FLEMING:  We don't disagree with that,
Justice Scalia, but we have new petitions that were
filed as a protective matter in these cases.  That --
that's not a problem.  These -- precisely because the
government was requiring everyone to file a new
petition, all of the Respondents' children in this case
have F2B petitions pending.  We don't think we need
them.  Our primary argument is they should have had the
original petition converted.
But if, for some reason, this Court
disagrees, we have F2B petitions there, as to which the
priority date can and should be retained, so either of
these is a sufficient basis to affirm the court of
appeals.
I haven't spoken much about step 2 of
Chevron because I think it can and should be resolved at
step 1.  But I would like to address the question
that -- the response that was made in -- in response to
Justice Ginsburg's question at the beginning.
The -- the point about the categories here,
it is a natural phenomenon of these categories that they
are fluid.  People are coming in and out of them at
various times, depending on naturalization, on marriage,
on termination of marriage, as people adopt children, as
people decide not to immigrate, as people pass away.
There is -- these aren't hermetically sealed categories.
Also, there is no way to apply (h)(3)
without some kind of movement.  Even the government's
theory of (h)(3) means that some people are going to go
out of the F2A category into the F2B category.
And so the question is, under Chevron step
2, which, again, we don't think the Court needs to
address, has the BIA drawn a rational line here, within
this group of beneficiaries who are all F2B, all
children of lawful permanent residents?
And the line the BIA drew is it says we are
going to treat better people who have two lawful
permanent resident parents than people who have one
lawful permanent resident parent, often, two, and a U.S.
citizen relative.  Is there a rational line for that?
The BIA certainly hasn't provided one.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Goldenberg, four minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Thank you, Your Honor.
The Respondents were trying to put far too
heavy a burden on the government in the Chevron
deference case.  So long as the Agency has arrived at a
reasonable reading of this very complicated statute, the
Agency is entitled to deference here.  And the
Respondents' idea that some kind of internal
inconsistency is absolutely required here is wrong.
Automatic conversion -- the phrase about
automatic conversion is ambiguous, and it renders the
whole provision ambiguous.
And let me address the idea that everyone
before the comma, everyone in the "if" clause of Section
1153(h)(3) necessarily qualifies here.  That's not true
under Respondents' own reading, and it can't be true
because there are going to be situations where someone
has their age calculated as over 21 as of the date the
visa becomes available to the parent, and the parent
never becomes a lawful permanent resident.
They don't qualify.  They come to the
border, and they are not let through the border.  And
so, in that situation, there are going to be people who
are named in that first part of the clause who are not going to be
be entitled to automatic conversion.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What he's saying -- but
what he's saying is that's true of everybody.  FBA, any
of these categories don't get converted until the visa
is actually issued --
MS. GOLDENBERG:  No, but that's not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- until you go to the
consular order -- office and apply.  That's true no
matter what.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  It's not true with respect
to F2A derivatives because they have an existing
relationship with the existing petitioner.  They don't
need the primary beneficiary to become a lawful
permanent resident in order to get automatic conversion.
But the broader point is that we are talking
about --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They can come in before
their parent?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  No, it's not that they can
come in --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Their parent has to
become a citizen, and then they can come in, correct?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor, but they
don't -- to get automatic conversion, they are not
relying on that new lawful permanent resident.  They are
relying on their existing relationship with somebody
else.
But the broader point here is we aren't
necessarily talking about a subcategory of people who
are named in that "if" clause who are going to benefit
from automatic conversion.
There's another example, as well, in the
diversity visa context.  Diversity visas don't have
priority dates.  So it's awfully hard to see the
derivative beneficiaries of diversity visas who are
named in the (h)2) definitional section are going to be
able to necessarily benefit from Section 1153(h)(3).
And even if you did think that everybody had
to sort of run through the 1153(h)(3) analysis, the
answer you come up with, with respect to certain people,
is it's a null category.  There is no appropriate
category for them, so the category is nothing.
I'd like to talk a little bit as well about
the retention issue that Respondents discussed.  And the
implication of Respondents' argument is, as I think
Justice Scalia recognized in his question, that somebody
can get a priority date and just walk around with it,
even if there is no valid petition pending as to them
and even if their parent never becomes a lawful
permanent resident.
So that would mean that aged-out derivative
beneficiaries, under Respondents' interpretation, would
be better off than children whose parents never become a
lawful permanent resident.  They would have a priority
date somehow in their pocket, that they could walk
around with and use 20 years later, when somebody filed
a different petition on their behalf, an employment
petition --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's not so
odd to say they've got a priority date in their pocket
when the statute says the original priority date --
they'll retain the original priority date.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes, but the statute is
most reasonably read to say, as all other automatic
conversion provisions do, that they retain the priority
date if the automatic conversion is possible, so that
there's a specific petition being identified that that
priority date is going to attach to, and not that you
just somehow have a priority date, which is, keep in
mind, a filing date, that you're just going to kind of
hold and walk around with and use it if you want.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Hold or maybe
retain.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well -- but in a situation
in which the parent never becomes a lawful permanent
resident, that would mean -- that would turn the -- the
notion of a derivative beneficiary upside down.  That
would mean that someone could, in effect, be a
derivative beneficiary and use that priority date in the
future, even if --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I am so confused.  You
better unconfuse me, okay, on this argument.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Sorry, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's an original date,
basically, to the original petition, meaning there
has -- it is that that's being converted.  If that
hasn't been granted, there's nothing to convert.  If
that person hasn't become a citizen, there is nothing to
attach any change to.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  But Respondents' argument
is that you don't need automatic conversion, that
retention of priority date --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're talking about his
second step.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  It's the -- exactly.  It's
the separate step.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  We're
talking about his second step.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  You just explained exactly
why that can't be right because you do need something to
attach it to.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  You're only
talking about his second argument.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Exactly.  But I would like
to go back to automatic conversion, if I could, and just
make a few more points.  And one is that the idea
that -- that Wang didn't say that the petitioner --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish --
finish that sentence.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Thank you, Your Honor.
The idea that the board in the matter of
Wang didn't say that the petitioner couldn't change is
simply wrong.  The board very, very clearly, on page 35
of its decision, says that conversion means that you
don't need a new petitioner.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
