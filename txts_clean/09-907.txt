CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this term in Case 09-907, Ransom v. FIA Card
Services.
Mr. Burke.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER P. BURKE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURKE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
In 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act.
It made a policy decision to limit judicial discretion
on a case-by-case basis in the area of reasonable and
necessary expenses. It did so by creating a formula
that entailed an aggregate set amount of expenses for an
individual.
Now, Congress could have created this from
scratch. It could have used an arbitrary figure. But
instead, there were figures that the IRS already had,
based on Census Bureau statistics, that said nationwide,
in a certain area, an individual would spend this much a
month on average.
In the case of Mr. Ransom, that's
approximately 2500 a month. Forgetting about how it's
divided up, if I had 100 people come in and answer the
following five questions the same way Mr. Ransom did,
and that's age, location, household size, gross income,
and if you have a vehicle, how many, they would all get
a $2500 standard aggregate deduction, which works out to
$150,000 over a 5-year period.
Now, the crux of this is whether or not
courts are allowed to dig in and cut out pieces of the
standard aggregate amount.
JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that the crux of it?
Congress made reference to the local standards, right?
MR. BURKE: Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO: And were the -- was the
commentary in the Collection Financial Standards in
existence at the time when Congress enacted this
provision?
MR. BURKE: There was a Collection Financial
Analysis that was in place, and it was noted in 1998 as
a prior version of the bill that ultimately wasn't
passed.
JUSTICE ALITO: And that explains what the
IRS understands the local standards to mean; isn't that
right?
MR. BURKE: I would disagree with that. I
would say -- well, it would -- it would explain what the
IRS means, but that's where I would end it, because the
IRS standards are used to collect taxes. They are
discretionary. They --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that, but
Congress decided to make reference to the local
standards in this bankruptcy provision, didn't it?
MR. BURKE: Standards.
JUSTICE ALITO: Yes.
MR. BURKE: It didn't go beyond that.
JUSTICE ALITO: And this -- and at the time
when it did that, there was official IRS commentary
regarding the meaning of those standards, correct?
MR. BURKE: For the IRS to use in collecting
taxes.
JUSTICE ALITO: And your argument is that
Congress intended to adopt the standards promulgated by
the IRS, but not the IRS's interpretation of the
standards.
MR. BURKE: Correct, not their methodology
or interpretation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Doesn't the chart say
"ownership costs"?
MR. BURKE: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you would read that
to mean non-costs as well? I mean, if the -- if the
table is called ownership costs, then why not use the
IRS's definition of what costs are, and that definition
says, what, loan payments and lease payments?
MR. BURKE: Because you -- we have to look
at it as a standard aggregate. And what I mean by that
is -- okay, the Bankruptcy Code doesn't define ownership
costs. And ownership costs could be the replacement
value. It could be buying a new vehicle. It could be
the costs associated with making payments on a vehicle.
What that -- that average number is, in this
case, $471, is a nationwide figure that somebody would
spend on average in a month. It doesn't mean that any
one individual spends that amount.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Burke, isn't it --
isn't it the case that, even on the other side's
interpretation of it, it doesn't come down to actual
costs anyway? Isn't it the case, or do I misunderstand
it, that so long as there is one payment, you get the
entire deduction?
MR. BURKE: That's their position, or even
JUSTICE SCALIA: Even one payment of $1, you
get the entire deduction. So to argue this case as
though it's a question of whether you actually expend
the money that you're getting the credit for is
simply -- is simply false. You don't do that under
either side's interpretation, right?
MR. BURKE: Again, I would perhaps --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm trying to help you,
Mr. Burke.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Burke, before you
respond to that question, isn't it so that in the event
that Justice Scalia just proposed, the trustee could
propose an amendment to the plan to reflect that that
cost is no longer being incurred?
MR. BURKE: The cost has never been
incurred. That's the point. And --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: My question is: In the
situation that Justice Scalia proposed, it's not
automatic that the $471 gets deducted because there
could be proposed an amendment of the plan to reflect
that that -- there's no longer any expense for
ownership.
MR. BURKE: In the situation where there is
a dollar, of course, an amendment can be made. But see
the -- the dollar doesn't show up in the means test.
The means test is the aggregate --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it isn't -- it isn't
automatic that because there's one payment, then
forever, the rest of the 5 years, he gets to deduct the
$471.
MR. BURKE: That's what the lower court
said.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What -- what
happens under the tax law? Do they make an adjustment
under the tax law as well?
MR. BURKE: Of course -- under the tax law,
you get a standard deduction.
JUSTICE SCALIA: A standard --
MR. BURKE: No different than here. Nobody
goes behind the scenes and says, hey, what is that
standard deduction?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. So that they --
what is suggested is that you look at it and apply the
IRS's approach as to whether you get into the chart, but
then you don't use the IRS's approach when the trustee
takes you out of the chart. Is that what you think is
the law?
MR. BURKE: No, that's not what I think is
the law. What I'm saying is Congress has given, in this
case, an individual like Jason Ransom $150,000 over 5
years to spend. They are not saying whether he actually
spends it in any one category.
For instance, the car ownership might be --
equate to $28,000 over 5 years. Rent might be 1,000.
That's 60,000 over 5 years. Congress did not say go
back and make sure Mr. Ransom is spending every dollar.
These are averages across the nation. And when it comes
to a car ownership expense, we're not saying spend $471.
Oh, you have no payment? You didn't spend anything for
5 years?
No. What it's saying is, over 5 years, I
have a cost associated with owning that vehicle, whether
it's a loan or lease payment, whether it's replacing the
vehicle, whether it's major repairs, on average, across
the country.
JUSTICE BREYER: You do. You do, but the
difficulty that I -- I don't get the answer to
Justice Ginsburg's first question.
Of course you have all kinds of costs
dealing with ownership, but what the IRS says, what it
says in the statute, is you are supposed to take the
applicable costs from IRS. And what it has on page 5a
is it has something called "ownership costs."
MR. BURKE: Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: And it defines those as
$471.
MR. BURKE: Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: And then on 3a, where it
says what ownership costs are, it says the
transportation standards consist of nationwide figures
for monthly loan or lease payments, referred to as
ownership costs. So when I read that, I said ownership
costs means monthly loan or lease payments, nothing
else.
Now, you have all kinds of other things.
It's just these words "ownership costs" don't refer to
those other things, because of that definition given
right there. That's what I thought Justice Ginsburg was
initially asking.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I was.
JUSTICE BREYER: And I -- and how -- how do
you get out of that what I think of as very, very clear
language which says what these standards refer to?
MR. BURKE: Because the standards refer to
the numbers. It's a chart.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but it doesn't -- for
example, suppose you buy a dozen apples every month, and
they cost you $48 extra. You're not going to say the
ownership costs refer to the apples, even if you
decorate the car with them.
(Laughter.)
MR. BURKE: What -- what --
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, ownership costs
refers to lease and loan payments. Nothing else.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the language we're
dealing with, Mr. Burke? Do you want to quote the
language to us?
Nobody's quoted the language. What does it
say is applicable?
MR. BURKE: What the statute says is the
applicable -- you shall get, mandatory, the applicable
amounts specified based on where a debtor resides --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. The -- the
applicable amounts specified where?
MR. BURKE: In the national local standards.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Read the text of the
statute, would you, please, for me? I couldn't even get
it from your brief. You had to refer me back to the
petition. Why isn't in an appendix to your brief or
printed in the beginning of your brief, instead of
kicking me back to dig out your petition?
MR. BURKE: "The debtor's monthly expenses
shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts
specified under the national local standards."
JUSTICE SCALIA: "Amount specified under"
the standard.
MR. BURKE: Specific amount, "applicable"
modifies "amounts specified."
JUSTICE SCALIA: "Applicable amounts
specified," not the amounts specified if applicable.
MR. BURKE: Correct, based on where a debtor
resides.
Now, the only way a court can say that an
individual has to have a debt on a car to get this
deduction -- there's two ways: One --
JUSTICE ALITO: Look at the local standard,
which is on page 8 of the appendix to your brief, right?
And all it says is "Ownership Costs," "First Car,"
"$471." That's the relevant text, isn't it?
MR. BURKE: Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO: What if a person leases a
car? Do you think they get ownership costs?
MR. BURKE: Yes, because they get the cost
whether they owe on it or not.
JUSTICE ALITO: But they don't own the car,
so how can they get ownership costs?
MR. BURKE: There's a different definition.
"Ownership" doesn't mean -- it can mean possession.
But --
JUSTICE ALITO: Where do you get that, from
the --
MR. BURKE: Black's Law Dictionary.
JUSTICE ALITO: -- from the Collection
Financial Standards?
MR. BURKE: No. The Collection Financial
Standards say you get the lease -- you get the deduction
if you have a loan or a lease payment.
JUSTICE ALITO: Where do you get the
definition that somebody who leases something owns it?
MR. BURKE: I don't. I'm not sure they do
own it.
JUSTICE ALITO: Then how do they get
ownership costs?
MR. BURKE: Because you have possession of
it. It's based on having the item. It's costs
associated with having the item, whether it's paid off
or not.
JUSTICE ALITO: If somebody rents an
apartment, do they own the apartment?
MR. BURKE: Probably under ownership, their
possession is some type of an ownership. It may be just
possessory.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there something wrong
with the IRS saying what they mean? It says ownership
costs means monthly loan or lease payments. Now, is
there something --
MR. BURKE: The problem --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what it says it
means. Now, is there something illegal about it
defining ownership costs in that way?
MR. BURKE: No, for the collection of taxes,
there is not. But if you're going to use -- start
digging into the manual, you might as well bring it all
into 707(b), and, as we discussed earlier, there was
language that said the collection financial analysis
should be brought in, but that was deleted in the final
version.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not just -- it says
you are supposed to look at the form; it says ownership
costs. So the only thing you'd look at the IRS for
is -- the manual -- is to define ownership costs. And
they say ownership costs means those two things.
MR. BURKE: Well, I don't -- there's no
reason to limit it. If you're going to -- the text
doesn't say -- it says national local standards. It
doesn't discriminate or give disparate treatment to that
one item. If you're going to give it to one item, then
it can be pulled in, and it should be -- the same
treatment should be given to all items, and we should
have to prove some type of a --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't follow that. If
the simple thing is to just -- what does the word
"costs" mean? And then you look to the IRS manual, and
it tells you that "costs" means loan or lease payments.
MR. BURKE: To collect taxes, that's how
they defined it. But in the statute it says you get
"local standard amounts specified." It does not stretch
it and say "under the IRS's interpretation." That
language was taken out. And if we were to use the IRS's
interpretation, here's the whole problem: It's
discretionary. It goes up and down. It's based on an
IRS revenue agent. It -- let me give you a separate
example. Nobody --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Burke, if we could stay
with this. The $471 is derived by looking at the
average loan or lease payments nationwide. Then, in
addition to that, we know that the IRS has a separate
category for operating costs that is meant to reflect
costs of having a car that are not your loan and lease
payments. So, between those two things, why wouldn't we
say that ownership costs means your loan and lease
payments, but operating costs means your other costs of
having a car, and that you get the operating costs if
you have a car but don't make loan and lease payments,
and you get the ownership costs if you do make loan and
lease payments?
MR. BURKE: Because to reach that, you have
to go into the Internal Revenue Manual. It's not in the
statute that says you have to owe on it to get it. And
if you go into the Internal Revenue Manual -- let's look
at operating expenses. What it says, in collecting
taxes -- and it's in the Joint Appendix at pages 83
through 88. But what it says, when it comes to local
national other expenses, an internal revenue agent has
discretion. You only get these expenses -- this is the
overall idea -- if they produce income or if it's for
health and welfare.
And so, when we look at the Joint Appendix
page 88, section B, under the local standard
transportation expenses, when it talks about operating
costs, which is something you just mentioned, it says
you only get transportation expenses that are used to
produce income or the health and welfare of an
individual and their family.
Plus, the fact that you own a car, the IRS
under its discretion can take away the operating costs
if it's on four cinder blocks in your backyard. You're
not incurring fuel costs, mileage costs; you are not
probably paying registration or any of those other
operating costs. The IRS agent, under their manual, can
take away that expense.
So, why stop and say, well, we're just going
to look at the ownership costs? And all they're saying
here is if you owe on it, you get it; if you don't owe,
you don't get it. Let's not look at anything else in
the Internal Revenue Manual, which is a 39-part,
500-page document that in some ways is almost
incomprehensible, and direct the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Burke, the -- it's
unusual to allow a deduction for the purpose of
calculating disposable income although you don't have
any expense. I understand how you get to that
conclusion with respect to car ownership. Is there any
other provision that in -- in calculating disposable
income, you are allowed a deduction for an expense that
you don't incur?
MR. BURKE: If the Court understands my view
that Congress gave --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. The question -- is
there anything else that works like this? You don't
have the expense, nonetheless you have the deduction?
Any -- I mean, there are a whole list of deductions,
expenses. Is there any other one that works this way?
It doesn't matter whether you have the expense, in fact.
JUSTICE KAGAN: For example, Mr. Burke, what
would happen if you didn't actually have any
out-of-pocket medical costs? Could you still claim a
deduction for out-of-pocket medical costs?
MR. BURKE: I'm saying you get all the
deductions, whether you owe on it or not. Is there a
specific one besides the car ownership that says you
have to owe on it? No. But my point is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the general view
of the courts? Is the answer that you just gave
supported uniformly by the courts that have looked at
this?
MR. BURKE: There's about 60 published
cases. They are split almost 50-50, actually more --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even -- in other words,
even on this point, they are split?
MR. BURKE: This is one line that they have
looked at in the cases. Basically --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what
you're saying. He asked, are they split 50-50 on the
point that is before us here? Yes or no?
MR. BURKE: Yes, they're about 50-50.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do they apply -- do the
courts apply the housing and utilities listed amount
whether or not you pay for a house or not, whether or
not you rent?
MR. BURKE: There's two published cases I'm
aware of, and both allowed it. One, somebody had
military housing; one, the house was paid off. Both
courts said you get it under the local standards. But
the IRS manual would not give that to you, because under
the local standards the IRS manual says you get the
specific amount or your actual payment, whatever is
less.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, once again, Mr.
Burke, this is -- I don't know why you don't point this
out. This is not the difference between your position
and the position of the other side. You get the
deduction for the other side as well, whether or not you
are making the payment. Now, maybe it can be adjusted
by the trustee, but as far as the statute is concerned,
so long as you make one payment of $1, under their
theory you're entitled to claim the deduction; isn't
that right?
MR. BURKE: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: My question, incidentally,
about courts was not with reference to the car expense.
It was with reference to the hypothetical or to the
issue proposed by one of my colleagues, that said, what
if you don't -- Justice Kagan -- suppose you don't have
the medical expense. And the answer -- and your -- and
I wanted to know if your answer is supported uniformly
by the courts that have looked at this, or if there is
also a split on that point?
MR. BURKE: I apologize for not
understanding it. No, every other expense deduction
that I have seen besides the car ownership, somebody
gets it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they get it
whether or not they incur that expense or not?
MR. BURKE: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words,
food -- you don't have to say, well, he did spend this
much money on food, so he gets the standard deduction.
MR. BURKE: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If he doesn't eat as
much as somebody else, he gets the same deduction,
right?
MR. BURKE: Correct. Or if he lives at home
and mom cooks for him.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Burke, even you
would say -- is this correct -- that if you don't own a
car at all, you can't claim the car costs?
MR. BURKE: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that -- is that by
reason of the Internal Revenue Service --
MR. BURKE: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- manual, or is it by
reason of the Bankruptcy Code itself?
MR. BURKE: It's by reason of the Bankruptcy
Code that refers to the standards, and the standards
specifically say you have one car, no cars, and you get
a public transportation, or two cars; pick the one.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's in the chart --
MR. BURKE: It's in the chart.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that you claim -- okay.
JUSTICE ALITO: What if you own a car, but
it's completely inoperable and it has no value? You buy
it for a dollar. It's a junk car, and you're planning
possibly to restore it at some point. Do you get the
deduction then?
MR. BURKE: Based on a strict reading of the
code, you get it.
Now, would the IRS allow it? Again, that's
a discretionary standard, but any time you have an
objective test, there's going to be line-drawing and
perceived unfairness on the outskirts.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And would your answer be
the same if the allowance was set, the decree was made,
and -- and the debtor then went out and bought the
junker to put in his driveway just in order to get the
400-plus dollars a month, or would that be deemed an
evasion of the law that could be addressed by the
Bankruptcy Court?
MR. BURKE: It can addressed by the
Bankruptcy Court, and that's the beauty of the statute.
We don't need to go into the Internal Revenue Manual.
We just need their tables, because there's a provision,
25(a)(3), that deals with good faith. So if it
appears somebody is not acting in good faith, then --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is -- we've got about
half the courts in the country agreeing with you. And
so you've read all those arguments, and what in your
opinion is the best one on the point, again, where I am
stuck, which is Justice Ginsburg's original point? I
mean, I can think of millions of examples. You have a
form that says -- the employer says entertainment
expenses. Then it defines entertainment expenses as
food and transport, and they leave out movies, you know.
Or you could have vacation expenses, and vacation
expenses are defined as transport and hotel, and they
leave out meals. And here we have a definition of
ownership expenses, and they say leasing and loaning,
and they leave out other forms of ownership.
MR. BURKE: Because --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the argument is, well,
that's what they mean by it, so that's what applicable.
Now, what's the best argument against that in those
cases? Why is it trying -- why to try to get an
expense which isn't loan or lease? Have you any more
right to it than if you tried to get an expense to my
totally irrelevant apples? I mean, it doesn't fit
within the applicable definition. What's the answer?
MR. BURKE: The means test is a form, and if
you look at the form -- the means test is a form.
JUSTICE BREYER: I've looked at the form.
MR. BURKE: If you look at the form --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. BURKE: It just says --
JUSTICE BREYER: Ownership.
MR. BURKE: That's it. There's no
definition in the form.
JUSTICE BREYER: But they -- two pages
earlier they say what they mean by the word "ownership."
MR. BURKE: Not the -- the IRM does.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. BURKE: Not the statute and not the B22
form that's filled out by debtors.
JUSTICE BREYER: You say half the courts
say, oh, you just sort of imagine what ownership
expenses are, and anything that they can fall within
that general English language word is what they can
deduct; is that their approach? Because we -- you say
cut off the definition, cut off the definition from the
word "ownership"; don't use it. So what do we use to
define what ownership is?
MR. BURKE: We don't have to. Congress gave
standard amounts for --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, I know, but it's for
ownership; it's not for, for example, whistling. It's
for ownership. So -- so how do we define what that $471
attaches to? Do we use a State common law definition or
something? How have they done it?
MR. BURKE: Because you can take it as a
bunch of variables. It's not in the Bankruptcy Code.
If -- so it could be replacement costs; it could be
major repairs; it could be --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this a problem
distinctive to your case? Doesn't the other side have
the same problem with ownership? Don't they acknowledge
that even if you are leasing the car you get the
deduction?
MR. BURKE: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see why this is
distinctive to your case. It's a problem both sides
face. And we don't avoid it by coming out against you,
do we?
MR. BURKE: No, we don't.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why?
JUSTICE ALITO: What if -- what if the
definition of --
JUSTICE BREYER: Why don't we?
JUSTICE ALITO: -- ownership costs was moved
into the local standards themselves? Would the outcome
be different then?
MR. BURKE: Are you saying in 707(b)?
JUSTICE ALITO: No. It's moved from the CFS
to the local standards, which are referred to in the --
in the code provision.
MR. BURKE: My answer would still be the
same because that's not a congressional formula. That's
a form that comes off the Department of Justice Website
which administers the U.S. Trustee's program and that's
their litigation position.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Burke, if the table
said loan and lease costs, you wouldn't have a case? If
it said -- instead of ownership costs, if it said loan
and lease costs, then you would sit down and you would
say I'm not entitled to that deduction?
MR. BURKE: No. I would say an individual
who owns a car, whether they owe or not, gets the
deduction because it's part of this aggregate standard.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Even if it's called loan and
lease costs?
MR. BURKE: Correct. It's not a breakdown
on what any one individual has. It's an aggregate.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You may want to save the
rest of your time for rebuttal.
MR. BURKE: Thank you. I will.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Maynard.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Bankruptcy Code precludes an above-
median-income debtor like Petitioner from shielding from
his creditors $471 a month for a car payment that he
does not have. A debtor with --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- food costs, housing
costs, utility costs, by getting his parents to pay for
those things and still take this deduction?
MS. MAYNARD: The statute allows a debtor to
take an applicable monthly expense amount. So if the
debtor truly has no food costs, then the food standard
would be not applicable to the debtor, so --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your adversary said that
only two courts have addressed this issue and have
permitted those deductions. So under what reasoning
would we apply a different standard to the car costs as
opposed to those other costs?
MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think, with respect --
I think the cases he was talking about were housing.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Housing.
MS. MAYNARD: Right. So housing and car
costs are part of the local standards. Food, clothing,
house cleaning supplies, those are part of the national
standards. The -- in our view, the text that goes along
with -- accompanies the tables, which is not the
Internal Revenue Manual -- it's just the pages reprinted
at 1a to 3a of our brief. The Collection Financial
Standards, the prefatory explanation for what the tables
mean. In our view, that is -- goes along with --
incorporated into the national local standards.
The national standards, Justice Sotomayor,
are allowed, as long as you have under the calculations
-- as explained in the standards, under the national
standards, a debtor would receive the allowance in the
table as long as they have any such expense, so
regardless of amount. However, if they have no such
expense, then they are taken out by the statutory
language in the means test, which says that the standard
must be applicable to the debtor. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if they have
pre-purchased their food expenses, so long as they have
$1 of food expense they get the entire expense even
though they're not incurring it?
MS. MAYNARD: If they are --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And there are things
like, you can pay up, you know, have the grocery deliver
your food every month and you can pay in advance, and if
you're paid up, you still get the full food expense that
is allowed?
MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. I think if,
over the 60-month period looking forward, you know, that
you're going to -- you've already paid up for your food
for the next 60 months and you're not going to incur any
additional food expenses, no, then in that situation the
standard would be inapplicable to you. You would be
having no -- in that hypothetical --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you paid $1
for food, you'd get the full amount for 60 months?
MS. MAYNARD: Under the standard. That's
the way the standards operate, Your Honor.
I haven't seen any cases litigated over food
expense --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your argument
leads to a result that's just as absurd as your
colleague's result on the other side.
MS. MAYNARD: I don't believe so, Your
Honor --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, that was a
big part of your argument. You said his position leads
to an absurd result, and yours is just as absurd.
MS. MAYNARD: I don't think so, Your Honor,
for this reason, which is that the national standards
are food, clothing, house cleaning supplies, things that
you expect every debtor to have. You don't see much
litigation about those expenses. The local standards,
however, operate differently. In our view -- and our
view's different from the government's, Justice Scalia.
In our view, under the local standards and the way that
they apply as explained in the Collection Financial
Standards, is that the debtor is allowed their actual
expense for the local standard or the amount in the
table, whichever is less. So in the hypothetical --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where does it say that?
MS. MAYNARD: In our --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The debtor's monthly
expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly
expense amounts specified under the national and local
standards. So the national and local standards have
amounts listed. Where does it say you take only the
actual, not the national or local standard?
MS. MAYNARD: I read that text, Your
Honor -- again, the Court doesn't need to decide this
maximum cap issue to decide this case, because the
Petitioner has no expense whatsoever, and so it's not
applicable to him.
But in our view, Justice Sotomayor -- in our
view, you get it from the language of the statute that
says the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts
specified under the national standards and local
standards. And the way that we understand the national
and local standards to work is, if you look at page --
it's explained on page 1a of the petition to our brief,
the red brief. Maximum allowance -- it's the third
paragraph down: "Maximum allowances for housing and
utilities and transportation, known as the Local
Standards, vary by location. Unlike the National
Standards, the taxpayer is allowed the amount actually
spent or the standard, whichever is less."
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's -- but that's
not what the provision at issue here says. It says you
use the amount specified under the national standards,
and you use actual for everything else. That's what the
statute said. So now you're trying to move the actual
into the first half of the text?
MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor, that's not how
I understand the text. The text provides --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why would you even
bother? Why don't you -- if -- if what you're arguing
is that only actual expenses are -- are what you can
claim, you wouldn't need the first half.
MS. MAYNARD: Yes, you would, Your Honor,
because what the -- what the statute's purpose here is
-- I mean, I think it's helpful to step back.
Chapter 13 sends one to chapter 7's means
test for the purpose of calculating the amounts
reasonably necessary for the maintenance and support of
the debtor. And Congress chose to import the -- the
methodology of the national standards and local
standards as a way both to set the categories of
expenses that debtors could receive payments for, and,
with the case of the national and local standards, to
set the amounts. They were worried about capping upper
discretion because Congress -- it's quite clear from the
text and the legislative history -- was concerned about
above-median-income debtors taking luxurious expense
amounts.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you would have
the statute read is: The debtor's monthly expenses
shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts
specified, as a -- as a maximum. You would have to add
"maximum" somewhere there.
MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor, because the
amount under the national standards, as the national
standards operate, is the -- is an allowance, not an
actual, and the amount under the local standards, as
they operate, is the amount actually spent or the amount
in the table, whichever is less. And, again --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your
position penalizes debtors who pay their expenses in
advance, who don't incur additional debt to pay for
things like their car. I would have thought the
Bankruptcy Code would think that's a good thing, that
they're not incurring debt that they can't afford to pay
off, but instead, to the extent they can, they're paying
expenses in advance. Why should somebody who does that
be in a worse position than somebody -- than somebody
who takes out a loan they can't afford to pay back?
MS. MAYNARD: Money is fungible, Your Honor,
so to the extent the debtor has incurred expenses before
going into bankruptcy instead of, as here, paying off
this more than $85,000 in credit card debt, shouldn't be
able to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he hasn't
incurred -- he hasn't incurred expenses. It's the whole
point, I guess, that he's paid for something.
MS. MAYNARD: He used his money, perhaps, to
purchase his car outright, instead of to pay down his
credit card debt, and so he has a salary of $50,000, and
he has a credit card debt of $85,000, and he owns a
-year car -- 2-year-old car outright. He should not be
able to deduct, as a measure of his reasonably necessary
expenses for his maintenance and support over the next
50 months, $28,000 that he doesn't need for a car
payment that he doesn't make.
JUSTICE BREYER: You're --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though he can
do it -- even though he can do it for everything else --
he can do it for food, he can do it for housekeeping
expenses, he can do it for personal care expenses, he
can even do it -- the other, the final category is
miscellaneous, so he can do it for anything.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, the miscellaneous, all
those numbers are capped, and the legislative history
makes clear Congress thought all those numbers would
actually effectively act as caps. In other words, to
the extent there was debate in the Congress, Congress
was concerned that these numbers were actually too low,
not that they were going to give anybody a windfall.
But to the extent --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you're proposing
is that every debtor has to go to the Bankruptcy Court
and show what their monthly food bills have been over
what period of time, how much their personal supplies
have been over what period of time? How can you
calculate forward what they are going to spend on a
monthly basis for each of those items? Isn't that the
reason the tables are used, so that you don't have to do
that?
MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor, and in the
national standards, which all the items you just list
are national standards, under the national standards you
don't do the actuals. On page 1a, it explains:
"Allowances for food, clothing and other items, known as
the National Standards, apply nationwide except for
Alaska and Hawaii.... Taxpayers are allowed the total
National Standards amount for their family size and
income level, without questioning amounts actually
spent."
For -- yes, for those hard-to-calculate
items, you do -- our position is you do get the amounts
in the chart. For local standards -- the local
standards, however, which include home, mortgage, lease
expenses, utilities, and transportation, which include
both ownership costs and operating costs, you get the
actual or whichever is less.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I must say your position is
more logical than the position that you read in some of
the instructions applicable to the -- to the chart
that's referred to in the Bankruptcy Code, but not
others. I mean, it seems to me, if you're going to read
in the requirement that have to have made a lease
payment, you should also read in the requirement that
you're referring to now, which would mean your deduction
is limited by the -- by the amount of your lease
payment.
I don't see why -- is there any reason why
one would read in the other one and not read in yours?
MS. MAYNARD: Not in our view, Your Honor,
because in our view the chart is -- is ambiguous about
what the number stands for. And so in the national
standards, the text, the prefatory text, explains that
the amount is an allowance if you have the expense. In
the local standards, the prefatory text explains that
the amount operates as a cap.
But the important point for this case, Your
Honor, is that you don't have to decide anything about
the national standards because Petitioner is left at the
statutory door. He has no applicable monthly expense
amount for operating --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Maynard, what would
happen if the debtor had a car that was 200,000 miles
old -- 200,000 miles, and it was going to break down,
you know, within the next 5 years? Would the debtor
then be able to take the deduction?
MS. MAYNARD: If the debtor owns the car
outright at the time they file for bankruptcy, they
would not get the deduction.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Even though if you look
ahead, if you project forward, it's pretty clear that
the debtor is going to have to incur those expenses?
MS. MAYNARD: They would not get the
deduction under this calculation. However, under this
Court's decision in Lanning, when one goes to project
the disposable income, it's conceivable that the debtor
could prove that it's known or virtually certain that
they will need a new car and that that could be
accounted for.
But -- but also the Bankruptcy Code in 1329
allows for modification of a plan, and so when the time
arises that their car conks out and they need a new car,
they can move to modify their plan. I think it's --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the modification works
for chapter 13, but it doesn't work for chapter 7; is
that right?
MS. MAYNARD: Well, they make that statement
in their reply brief, Your Honor, but I'm not sure
exactly what they mean by that, because in chapter 7
this test is being used for a very different purpose.
It's the gateway; it's a presumptive test for abuse.
And so, again, our reading makes perfect sense in that
context because what you want to know is, does this
debtor actually have moneys it can prepay its creditors,
should it be --
JUSTICE BREYER: The -- sorry. Are you
finished?
MS. MAYNARD: I was -- I actually haven't
answered her question.
JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you finish
answering the question?
JUSTICE BREYER: Finish, yes.
MS. MAYNARD: So, in chapter 7, once you --
if you decide it's presumptively --- not presumptively
abusive, and you stay in chapter 7, then chapter 7 is a
liquidation. There's no ongoing plan. So I -- all of
your nonexempt assets are liquidated, your creditors are
paid off, and then you are discharged. If 3 years from
now your car conks out, you're just like you and me; you
are not in bankruptcy, you just -- you try to make do.
JUSTICE BREYER: I think it is -- well, I'm
trying to work out what was his point. And I don't
blame him for this. But trying to figure it out, he
says look: This whole thing was written for a different
purpose than the IRS, and if we start reading all those
things from the beginning into the tables, we're really
going to get into a mess. For example, we are going to
give people deductions when they have lease payments,
even though they're not owners when they have lease
payments. The company owns -- not even an ownership
expense, but it does say use the lease payment. And
then it has all these other things.
So forget it; do a simple thing. It says
ownership expense. You go to the registry of motor
vehicles and you say, is Smith the owner? And they'll
tell you, yes or no. And if the answer is yes, he
deducts $471. Sometimes that's too little; sometimes
that's too much. But once we depart from that, we're
really in a nightmare of trying to figure out what all
these things mean that were written for other purposes.
So, what do you say to that?
MS. MAYNARD: I say, Justice Breyer, that
there's nothing in the statute or the legislative
history that suggests this was meant to be an overall
budget for above-median-income debtors. This was about
capping upper discretion and limiting the expenses
available as reasonably necessary expenses for
above-median-income debtors.
And I think that point is made perfectly
clear by the fact that if you can compare it to what
happens now to a below-median-income debtor, a
below-median-income debtor in the same situation as
Petitioner, who owns his car outright, would be allowed
no amount as an expense for his vehicle, because he
doesn't have an actual expense that's reasonably
necessary.
And I think that the 2005 Congress would
think it was a senseless result, as they argue here,
that Petitioner gets $471, above-median-income debtor,
the very class of debtors with whom Congress was
concerned in the 2005 amendments, to shield from his
creditors over the life of the plan when he has no
comparable expense.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What we are talking about
is a paradigm of someone -- we're comparing someone who
has a $470-a-month car payment and he gets -- and he
gets the deduction. Why is that, in light of the second
sentence -- let's see, the third sentence of the
statute, which says, "Notwithstanding any other
provision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the
debtor shall not include any payments for debts." I
mean, that would be the car company.
And has -- has that point been litigated?
MS. MAYNARD: That -- that sentence is
somewhat of a conundrum, Your Honor, and I think that
the Court doesn't need to decide the meaning here,
because whatever it does, it doesn't get Petitioner
within the Romanette ii calculation --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No -- no, but it would --
MS. MAYNARD: -- because he has no payment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It would eliminate the
anomaly that -- one of the principal anomalies. There
are many anomalies in each position. It would eliminate
one of the principal asymmetries that seems to concern
the counsel and the Court.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, my understanding of that
provision is that it serves two purposes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That it?
MS. MAYNARD: Serves two purposes. The
first is that it makes clear -- in the back of our
brief, we have the other necessary expenses from the
IRM. And on -- near the back, page 25a, two of the
categories of other necessary expenses are secured or
legally perfected debts and unsecured debts.
So I think the -- the otherwise -- the
"notwithstanding" sentence makes clear that Romanette ii
should not capture those other unsecured debts and
secured debts, that it's the very purpose of this whole
calculation to figure out how much money you have to pay
those things.
The second purpose the sentence serves is to
make sure that there is no double-counting, because
Romanette iii, the very next provision in the means
test, allows the debtor to claim monthly payments for
secured debts. Now, many car loans are probably secured
debts, and in our view if you actually have a car loan
-- now, remember again, he neither has a car loan, nor a
car lease payment, nor any kind of ownership payment.
But if -- if one actually did have a car
loan that was secured by the car, which I think is the
vast majority of car loans, in our view the debtor
expenses nothing for that under Romanette ii, and only
the actual amount of that debt under Romanette iii.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the -- the
general position was you get either the actual payment
or the 471, of whichever is higher.
MS. MAYNARD: Whichever is less.
I think that -- that's my understanding of
how the local standards work, Your Honor. I think,
then, as a practical matter, that really will end up
only applying to car leases with respect to
transportation ownership costs, because I think that the
"notwithstanding" sentence removes secured car loans
from Romanette ii and has them calculated under
Romanette iii, where there is no comparable cap.
And the -- but -- but the point at issue in
this case doesn't involve the interaction between
Romanette ii and Romanette iii, because no matter how
those two things interact, when the debtor has no
payment whatsoever, he ought not to be able to claim any
car ownership costs, because what we're trying to figure
out is what amounts does he reasonably need for his
maintenance and support? And this question is a very
important question. This scenario happens a lot.
In the 2007 study that U.S. Trustees did is
-- at Congress's request to which Petitioner cites in
his reply brief, the average overpayment of a debtor in
claiming this transportation ownership expense was $335,
which is a lot when you're talking about the standard in
the chart being 471. There are many debtors who are
getting this expense either above their amount or when
they have no such expense at all, and so even if the
Court doesn't resolve these other issues that are
implicated by this case, the decision here is a simple
one, which is: This debtor has no applicable monthly
expense amount for transportation ownership costs, and
he shouldn't be allowed to expense any amount for that.
If there are no further questions, the
Respondent requests the Court would affirm the judgment
below.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Saharsky.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The only question this Court needs to
resolve in this case is whether the vehicle ownership
expense is applicable to Petitioner. The answer is no.
The ownership cost is for loan and lease
payments, the cost to acquiring the vehicle, and he just
doesn't have any payments of that type. To allow him to
pretend that he does would create absurd results. He'd
be able to shield approximately $28,000 from his
unsecured creditors, and he'd be better off than lower
income chapter 13 debtors. And we just don't think that
that's a result that Congress intended. We don't think
it --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if he paid --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- excuse me,
Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If he paid a dollar,
he would be able to shield $27,999, and you're
comfortable with that result?
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, that goes to the
question of whether the amount in the table is the
amount to be used or a cap on actual expenses. In our
view, it is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I understood
your brief to say it was the amount -- you get the whole
amount, not simply as a cap.
MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. Now, of
course, we haven't seen -- the executive office for
U.S. Trustees has not seen any $1 payments. It doesn't
know of any such commercially available payments. It
suspects the payments would be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the point of the
$1, counsel, is to lead to the extreme hypothetical that
would flesh out your position, what if it were $10,000
and the amount would give him $30,000? The trustees
have probably seen loans like that.
MS. SAHARSKY: What I'm saying, Your Honor,
is that there are many circumstances in which an expense
amount is a standard amount, but you still need to make
a threshold showing that it's applicable to you.
And if I could give the Court one example:
When an individual does his Federal income tax forms,
you can take a deduction for your dependents, but you
can't just take a deduction for any child you have. You
have to take a deduction -- you can take a deduction if
the person lives at home with you for more than 1 year
and have you a certain amount of expenses to support
them, and that is a standard deduction that you get on
your tax forms. The IRS doesn't ask everyone to figure
out their actual costs.
It is the case in real life that there are
allowance amounts that are average amounts that are
given to people once they meet the criteria. And that's
what we are saying happens here.
Now, that is, again, only a disagreement as
to what you do with people who actually have vehicle
ownership expenses.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why aren't -- why isn't one
of the criteria the -- the provision that says maximum
allowances for housing and utilities and transportation,
known as the local standards, vary by location, and
unlike the national standards, the taxpayer is allowed
the amount actually spent or the standard, whichever is
less? Why doesn't that apply?
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, because, Your Honor, in
that case it's the IRS commentary we are referring to
that's on page 1a of the red brief appendix.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MS. SAHARSKY: And that -- what that's
referring to is -- it says the amount actually spent or
the standard. And that's distinguishing between the
amount that's actually spent or the standard, which is
the standard --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MS. SAHARSKY: -- amount in the table.
Right.
And of course, we look to what -- the text
that Congress enacted in the Bankruptcy Code, and that
says that the debtor's monthly expenses shall be the
debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts specified
under the national standards and local standards.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not applicable. It's
not applicable if, in fact, you haven't spent that much.
Just as you claim it's not applicable if you have no
payment at all.
MS. SAHARSKY: I think that it is -- it
would further Congress's purposes to say that you
have to -- that you look to the actual costs that the
debtor has. But we just don't think the text goes that
far, because it says that if the expense amounts -- the
category is applicable to the debtor, that then you use
the expense amounts specified under the table. But --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but the -- but the
gravamen of Justice Scalia's question is: Why are you
running away from 1a, which is what Respondent's counsel
relied on? And if that were clearly relevant to this
statute, it would seem to me to answer the question.
Are you saying we -- we don't look at this
because it's just simply an interpretation; it's not a
regulation? What is -- what is -- in your view, what
effect do we give to this language that Justice Scalia
quoted? Nothing at all?
MS. SAHARSKY: It would not be relevant in
the bankruptcy context, in our view, and the reason is
because the -- the statutory text refers to the
standards. And in our view, you can look to the IRS
commentary to see what the standards mean, what their
scope is, as Justice Breyer was discussing with his
apples hypothetical.
But this additional language is guidance to
IRS agents in tax delinquency cases about how to collect
taxes. As Petitioners --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we -- suppose we
think the word "applicable" is ambiguous and difficult
to construe. Do we then look at this language at 1a, or
do you say it's irrelevant in all instance -- in all
respects?
MS. SAHARSKY: You -- Your Honor, you could
look at this language, but we think that it reflects not
the standards, but what -- how the IRS uses the
standards in individual cases of tax delinquency.
To the extent that the IRS is defining what
the standards are, what the scope of the standards are
-- for example, that ownership costs are loan and lease
payments -- of course, we would think that you would
look to that, but this additional guidance to IRS agents
we don't think is what Congress meant when it said
"expense amounts specified under the standards."
But we do think that the text could be read
the way you suggest.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So then you would be
comfortable with a person who owns a house outright, who
only pays $100 in utilities, taking the full amount of
the housing and utilities allowable living expenses
because that's the amount specified?
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the housing and
utilities expenses have been broken out into a mortgage
and rent component and a utilities component. So in
that circumstance, we would say the individual only is
allowed the utilities component, but it would be the
allowance amount that is specified. It would not be his
actual amount.
But, again, this is a question that was not
considered by the courts below. In fact, the bankruptcy
appellate panel said it is -- in footnote 20 of its
brief, said this question is not in this case; it's not
before us whether you use the amounts in the table or
whether you use the actual amounts. And we don't think
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Saharsky, I
should -- I should probably know this, but if you do
have amounts that are excluded from the disposable
income because of car ownership, in other words, you
actually have, from -- in your point of view, expenses,
do they have to go to the -- pay off the car loan or are
they available for everybody? All the creditors?
MS. SAHARSKY: They're not available for the
creditors. The idea behind this calculation is that
there, of course, are secured debts that have priority,
and then this calculation is used to figure out how much
money is left to pay unsecured creditors. And the idea
is that the debtor has certain expenses, that he needs
to keep money for himself so he can continue with the
everyday business of life. For example, the car
ownership payment is designed to ensure that a vehicle
can still use and have access to a car, and if someone
has a loan or lease payment, they need to be able to
continue making that payment in bankruptcy, but if they
don't have any such payment, then they don't have this
need for this additional fund because --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But can he decide --
let's say he has more food expense than is allowed. Can
he decide of the amount that would otherwise go for the
car payment that he's going to pay some of that for the
food expenses?
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, certainly the
Bankruptcy Court doesn't scrutinize, you know, what
happens to that regard. What it's just trying to do is
figure out the disposable income that is available to
pay unsecured creditors, that the debtor doesn't need.
And I should just note with respect to this
question of whether there is an overall budget that the
debtor is allowed, you know, that's certainly not the
case in any of the other provisions that follow this
applicable monthly standards and local standards. You
have the actual other necessary expenses, actual
continuation of taking care of chronically ill family
members. And Petitioner himself acknowledges that he
has to show that he has a car. So it's not the case
that every debtor is just getting some set amount of
money to do what they will with. Congress has
referenced the standards. The standards break this out
into certain expenses. It says just take the applicable
ones. And we just don't think it makes sense to
interpret "applicable" in that circumstance to --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Saharsky, could you
explain to me the government's position on when a debtor
with loan and lease payments gets to deduct them under
Romanette ii? In other words, this goes back to Justice
Kennedy's question, the notwithstanding clause and
whether the notwithstanding clause effectively excludes
all loan and lease payments from Romanette ii?
MS. SAHARSKY: It does not have that effect,
Your Honor. What it does is to take out the actual debt
payments that are part of the other necessary
expenses -- these are on page 25a of the red brief --
that counsel on our side mentioned. These are other
necessary expenses that are actual debt payments, and
the local and national standards are expense amounts.
We don't think that Congress defined those to be debt
payments.
So the function of the payments for debts
language, we agree with Respondent's counsel, would be
twofold. First, it would excise the other necessary
expenses that actually are debt payments, which makes
complete sense. You know, one of them is an unsecured
debt payment, and you wouldn't want to consider that one
of your expenses because the whole point of the
calculation is to figure out how much money you have
left to pay unsecured debts. And then the other
function that it serves is in Romanette iii because you
were getting secured debt payments there to not
double-count them in Romanette ii.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, in other words, the
loan and lease payments don't count as debt for purposes
of the notwithstanding clause; they count as expense
amounts?
MS. SAHARSKY: We say that those are expense
amounts that are specified. They're not payments for
debts. I should note, because Justice Kennedy asked
this question, that this was not something that was
relied upon by the courts below. I don't believe that
there's any definitive court of appeals opinion that
goes through in detail what that provision is designed
to do. So I would urge this Court that it need not
resolve it in this case and instead do what the court of
appeals did, which is to say that, just looking at the
plain text, the word "applicable" means not everybody
can get these amounts in the national and local
standards, and it needs to be someone who actually has
those payment amounts. The whole point of this part of
this statute is to figure out what money is available to
pay unsecured creditors, and it's payments that need to
be made for expenses that matter. It's not whether the
individual debtor has a car.
I also note, just because it came up earlier
and is a very important point, that to the extent that
the Court only wants to look at the tables to figure out
what are ownership costs, are they loan and lease
payments, just looking at the title of the table,
Ownership Costs, you need to have costs. Looking at the
fact that there are two different ones -- there's
ownership costs as opposed to operating costs -- makes
clear that some of the things that Petitioner suggests
might be ownership costs are, in fact, operating costs.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Burke, have you 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER P. BURKE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURKE: Thank you.
The means test knows when to say "actual"
when it wants to say "actual." It didn't say "actual"
in this case; it said "applicable."
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Burke, would you
explain one facet of this case to me? Given the
deduction, the $471 deduction, disposable -- projected
disposable income comes down to $210?
MR. BURKE: Correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: As opposed to -- it would
be 600 some dollars if you didn't count the $471?
MR. BURKE: Correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the
disposable income figure was $210, the debtor was
willing -- the debtor proposed paying $500. Why did the
debtor come up with a $500 figure when projected
disposable income without the car ownership would be --
if he gets the car ownership, would only be $210?
MR. BURKE: This is exactly why our view of
the law works. The means test is a minimum amount.
It's a bottom-line quick figure based on standard
deductions. It was $200 based on our calculation if
he's given his deductions based on age, location, et
cetera.
We then go back to I and J, and J, which is
on page 44 of the Joint Appendix, is his current
expenses. And if we look at line 13A, there is no
vehicle payment. He's not taking $471. He took his
income and expense. The bottom line was 500. He knew
he had to pay at least 200. He's willing to pay the
500. He's not getting a $471 deduction because there is
no car payment on his Schedule J.
And if we look at the formula that way, the
means test is a general form to give standard
deductions, to give us a quick bottom line, and the
debtor is either going to pay that amount or more based
on his income and expense, and he would pay more if he
really didn't have that expense. So if he didn't have a
rent expense of $1,000 a month, it would show up on
Schedule J that he didn't have 1,000, so his payment
would go to $1,500 a month. That's the good faith
that's involved in this case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It would have to go to
1,500 a month, or he, out of the goodness of his heart,
would decide to pay that amount?
MR. BURKE: He's going to have to pay an
amount of at least $200.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. BURKE: It would be hard to confirm a
case if he doesn't pay somewhere in that range.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Fine. So why -- why would
we assume that he -- I don't know -- your client is an
extraordinarily generous fellow. I don't think most
people, when they go through bankruptcy, are going to
cough up any more than they have to.
MR. BURKE: It's the only way for the form
and the law to work. The means test is a bottom-line
number. If you don't have one of those expenses, it
shows up on Schedule J, and it gives you a number. If
it's higher, we think you should probably pay it or in
that range. If it's lower, Congress isn't saying you
get away with it; it says you get out of chapter 13 if
you're not going to pay this amount. So the formula is
just to come up with a bottom line. Nobody is shielding
anything.

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that the
Bankruptcy Code provision freezes the -- the national

existed at the time when the statute was enacted?
MR. BURKE: At the time the debtor files,
those numbers are frozen.
JUSTICE ALITO: But the IRS can change --
otherwise, they can -- going forward, they can
completely change the national and local standards?
MR. BURKE: The numbers, but not the
structure. They can do anything they want when they're
collecting taxes, but the numbers -- and I think the
numbers change on an annual basis.
