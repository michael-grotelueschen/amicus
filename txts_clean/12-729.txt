Mr. Wessler.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W.H. WESSLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WESSLER:  Thank you.
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:
This case involves an accrual provision in
an ERISA plan that starts the clock running on a Federal
denial of benefits claim near the beginning of ERISA's
mandatory internal claims process before the Federal
claim ever exists or could be filed in court.
This provision directly conflicts with
ERISA's two-tiered remedial structure, which is designed
to maximize the number of claims that are resolved
internally without lawyers in courts.  The Respondent's
provision undermines this goal by making it impossible
for anyone to know in advance how much time will be left
on the limitations clock after the internal process is
complete.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How much time was left in
this case?
MR. WESSLER:  There was approximately one
year, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you -- and if there
were a one-year limitation running from the final
administrative review, you would be out?
MR. WESSLER:  Well, I don't think we would
be out in this case, Your Honor, because the provision
in this case was a three year from final denial.  Going
forward, if, in fact, ERISA plans had a one-year clock
running from final denial, everyone would know that they
would need to file their claim within one year from time
of final denial.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but if there were
such a rule, one year from the final administrative
decision, this claim would become too late.
MR. WESSLER:  If, in fact, the provision in
this plan --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  Yes.
MR. WESSLER:  -- said one year from final
denial, that's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What accounts for the
delay?  When the -- the clock was running and more than
a year went by before this suit was instituted, why was
that -- why did that happen?
MR. WESSLER:  Well, I think this gets us,
Your Honor, to one of the core problems with this
provision, which is that it's confusing.  It is unclear.
One of the key questions with these provisions, when
they're coupled with the mandatory exhaustion
requirement, that is -- that is actually quite uncertain
when proof of loss is due.
And so below, one -- one of the key
questions, which actually still remains unresolved, is
when the clock actually started ticking.  But I think
there's a -- there's a more fundamental problem --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I thought
the court below said that that was irrelevant to the
resolution of this case, that even if they accepted your
date for when the proof of loss started, that you would
still lose.
MR. WESSLER:  In this case, Your Honor,
that's true; however, the problem with these proof of
loss dates coupled with this mandatory exhaustion
requirement is that it is unclear from the outset
when -- when the clock -- how much time after final
denial would be left when you're in the middle of the
process.  And on this question of proof of loss --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm a little confused
because it would be the same no matter what rule we
instituted.
MR. WESSLER:  Well, I -- I don't think
that's right, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Meaning, you would never
know when the administrative -- you really never know
when the administration process is final, just like
you're arguing you don't know when the proof of loss
date is final.  But at least the advantage of proof of
loss, you know you got three years from at least the
beginning of the process.
MR. WESSLER:  Right, although I -- there's
actually quite a bit of disagreement among the lower
courts about how you measure proof of loss, when that
date actually triggers the limitations clock.
So for instance, in the Seventh Circuit, the
court has held that proof of loss starts the clock
ticking the first time proof of loss is due under the
plan, which is the first set of documents that a
claimant actually provides to her plan supporting her
claim for disability.
The plan, however, through this internal
process, can come back and ask for more documents, more
evidence supporting the disability.  And if the claimant
then provides those additional documents, that could
conceivably reset the limitations clock under this proof
of loss requirement.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That can only help you.
That can only help you.  It gives you more time, but it
doesn't take time away from you.
MR. WESSLER:  That's true, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You have three
years, no matter what.  From the first date, you have
three years.
MR. WESSLER:  Well, in fact --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you need more time,
you have a potential out.
MR. WESSLER:  Well, in fact, you don't have
necessarily three years from when proof of loss starts
because courts, as respondents themselves acknowledge,
are necessarily going to have to evaluate these -- these
provisions on a case-by-case basis.  So it's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you know, I guess
there are answers to these -- to these legal questions,
whether it's the first filing or if supplemental
documents are required, it's the second filing.  There's
an answer, you know?  Some court will provide the
answer.
The mere fact that -- that provisions in a
contract are subject to various interpretations doesn't
make the provision invalid.  It means something.  We
just don't know right now what it means until -- until a
court provides the answer.  But, wow, that's not
different from any contract.
MR. WESSLER:  Well, except, Your Honor, that
in ERISA, one of the core goals of this statute is to
provide predictability, certainty, and efficiency in the
administration of benefits.
And so to have courts being placed in the
center of what should be a straightforward and
streamlined process undermines the way Congress intended
this benefits administration process to proceed.  And if
you -- if you place courts exactly in the middle of
this, where they're going to necessarily be policing the
enforceability of a -- of a limitations provision before
they ever get to the question of were the benefits
properly denied, you're undermining the nature of what
this private process is supposed to be.
It was supposed to be intended to allow the
parties to privately resolve their benefit claims
without --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But ERISA itself contains
no statute of limitations, and it's generally assumed
that, therefore, this State statute of limitations would
govern, and if a State has the position that parties can
contract the statute of limitations -- I mean, ERISA
does have -- does have a statute of limitations for
breach of fiduciary claims, right?
MR. WESSLER:  That's -- that's correct, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And it has none for this
kind of claim.
MR. WESSLER:  That's correct, Your Honor.
And I think it was reasonable for Congress to expect
that the -- that -- that for these denial of benefit
claims, we would look to State law to determine the
length of the period.
But when that period starts running -- and
that's -- that's what's at stake here, is when the
limitations clock starts running -- was not a question
that we would look to State law for; rather, it's a
question of Federal law.  When does the claim actually
become ripe?  When can you file it in court?
And -- and what -- what we have here is a
limitations provision that includes an accrual date that
starts the clock running, not just before when you can
file it in court, but before there's ever even been an
injury.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, ERISA doesn't have a
statute of limitations, it doesn't specifically set out
a statute of limitations for this type of claim.  But it
does have a savings clause that says it doesn't preempt
State laws that regulate insurance.
So what would happen in this situation?
Let's say that a State statute says essentially what the
plan at issue says.  It says that a claim for the
incorrect denial of insurance benefits must be brought
within three years after the proof of loss.
And now let's assume we agree with you, that
under ERISA, any statute of limitations for the denial
of benefits must begin not when the proof of loss must
be filed, but upon the denial of benefits.
Does it follow, then, that the rule that
you're advocating would mean that ERISA preempted the
State law that regulated insurance in the way that I
just specified?
MR. WESSLER:  I -- I would think it would,
because it -- because it would conflict with ERISA's
remedial structure.  I would stress here that in this
case, we know that these State laws don't apply to
Respondent's provision.  They themselves have made that
clear in their opposition brief.
Most State laws, however, actually include
language to the effect of that insurers can use these
kinds of proof of loss languages or something similar so
far as it's not any less favorable.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I think your answer to
that question has to be yes; otherwise, the situation
would be a mess.
MR. WESSLER:  Yes.  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But I -- but in -- in what
sense is the law that I hypothesize not a law that
regulates insurance?  So why wouldn't it fall within
ERISA's savings clause?
MR. WESSLER:  It might as a first step, Your
Honor, but I think it would be impliedly conflicted
because it conflicts with the Federal structure of
ERISA.  And the key point about these State law
provisions, which is I think where this provision comes
from in Respondent's plan, is that these State law
insurance regimes do not require mandatory exhaustion of
any internal claims process.
You -- your clock starts running at proof of
loss and so long as you wait a 60-day waiting period,
you can then file your claim in court regardless of
whether the insurer has actually acted on your claim.
That is not true here.  Claimants do not
have the ability to file their claims in court until
they have exhausted this mandatory process.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there any evidence in
other circuits that have this same rule that -- that the
approach the Respondents advocate has caused
difficulties and disruption and unfairness?
MR. WESSLER:  Well, I think we have seen
courts struggling with a host of questions about how to
resolve the enforceability of these provisions.  As just
an example, we know that courts are in the -- are having
now to be in the business of asking whether the parties'
conduct during this internal process has caused some
waiver or estoppel of the limitations provision.
That kind of inquiry, an estoppel kind of
inquiry, is a fact-based inquiry about whether the
plan's conduct in the internal process was unduly
reasonable --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in this case, as
Justice Ginsburg indicated at the outset, there was a
period of, I think, just over a year, in which it was
very clear that the administrative process had ended and
nothing happened.  I don't see the unfairness in the
application of the rule in this case.
MR. WESSLER:  Yes, Your Honor, but I think
the core problem here isn't so much one of unfairness as
it is certainty and predictability of what employees'
and plans' rights are under an ERISA plan.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but there is also
certainty and fairness in processing the claim, and when
evidence is lost, especially in cases where employees
who were key witnesses have likely departed, that's
another very important consideration.
MR. WESSLER:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  But
to be clear, there is nothing about Respondent's
provision that advances any of those goals any more than
running a limitations clock one year from final denial.
As this Court has said, the internal claims
process itself provides notice to all the parties about
the possibility for claims and, critically, preserves
all of the evidence that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What happens -- what
happens if you brought suit before the exhaustion, while
it was still going on, before it ended, but you said to
the judge, Judge, we're in the middle of exhausting, so
don't -- we don't want to hear the case until that's
finished, can you do that or not?
MR. WESSLER:  I think that is a very open
question.  I do not know the answer.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's an open question.
So then if it were held that you could do
it, you could file the lawsuit within the three years
and if exhaustion had not taken place, well, just don't
hear the case until the exhaustion does.  That would
solve your problem.
MR. WESSLER:  I think it would, but I also
think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, it wouldn't solve
your problem because you waited too long.  But I mean
that would solve the problem of other people in the
future in your situation.
MR. WESSLER:  Correct.  It would create a
vehicle for protecting the claimant's rights and
providing certainty --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What is it that stops that?
I mean, on that ground you would say these clauses are
valid.  It's valid to say he has to -- you have to bring
a lawsuit within three years.  Nothing wrong with that.
File a protective complaint.
MR. WESSLER:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  But
that gets lawyers and courts involved in a process that
should be private.  ERISA's internal benefits process,
it processes millions of claims a year.  If we have
lawyers turning what should be a non-adversarial,
private process into one that is adversarial and that
allows for the possibility of filing protective actions
in which we ask the Federal court to stay a potential
Federal claim that may never exist while we are in this
indeterminant, flexible process, the courts would be
brought directly into a process that should be private.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, if we rule in
your favor -- I'm sorry, against you -- and just say the
plans can do this, do you see any reason why the
government couldn't pass a regulation saying you've got
to give people at least a year from the end of the
administrative process to file?
MR. WESSLER:  I can't speculate on what the
government would do.  I don't actually know if they
would have the authority to do that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm going to ask them
that question.
MR. WESSLER:  I'm sure you are.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But are you aware of
anything that would stop them from doing that?
MR. WESSLER:  I am not.  Their regulations,
what they have now addresses the internal claims
process.  It doesn't address the rights that exist when
you get to Federal court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we rule in your
favor, however, they would be estopped from passing a
regulation requiring something different than what we
say, correct?
MR. WESSLER:  I would think that that's
right.  I mean, I think -- I think a rule of accrual
that the limitations clock starts running at final
denial is exactly the kind of uniform and clean rule
that everyone can rely on ex ante, from the outset,
across the board in every jurisdiction in the country.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Wessler, this just I
think follows up on Justice Kennedy's question, but have
you identified any cases in which this serves to prevent
somebody from bringing a suit?
MR. WESSLER:  We have not found any cases in
which a claimant has actually lost the right to file a
suit.  The problem isn't so much in that possibility.
The problem is in what we do see, which is where there
are three or four or two or five months left after final
denial on the clock, and courts are now in the business
of having to evaluate, does that give enough time to the
claimant to do all the things that she needs to do to
file her claim?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it seems as though those
courts have been pretty liberal in saying, whenever it
is necessary, no, take a little bit more time.  So, this you know, it
seems just a little bit like a solution in search of a
problem.
MR. WESSLER:  I think in fact it's just the
opposite.  Running the clock during the internal process
ex ante, no one knows where they will be at the end.
This process is indeterminate.  We want the parties to
take all the time they need to work it out.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I didn't understand your
response to Justice Breyer's question, Mr. Wessler.  I
don't see how a Federal court that simply stays its --
stays its hand, abides the termination of the
administrative proceeding, is in any way engaging in any
kind of adversary process.
MR. WESSLER:  With respect, Your Honor, it's
not the court that is engaging in the adversarial
process.  It's the private internal claims process that
is supposed to be non-adversarial that has now become
adversarial because there is now a lawyer involved who
has advised her client that she must file a protective
action to avoid the possibility that she will lose her
claim.  We don't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, many people in the
administrative process aren't represented, but some are,
right?
MR. WESSLER:  That's right, but we think
that this provision would incentivize more lawyers
getting involved because if you are uncertain about how
much time you'll have you will be in a position where
you will want advice.  This provision breeds confusion, and
when we are confused we look for help, and the help that
is going to come into this process are lawyers who are
going to take those kinds of strategic action that
Justice Breyer suggested and involve the courts in what
should be a private process.
That in and of itself drastically undermines
the point of this internal benefit administration and
just amplifies and magnifies the litigation costs
associated with it.
If I could reserve the rest of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Anders.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS,
FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. ANDERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The limitations provision in Respondent's
plan deviates from bedrock Federal limitations
principles in a way that undermines ERISA's two-tiered
remedial framework.  Congress enacted that remedial
structure, which requires mandatory exhaustion before
judicial review, against the established limitations
principle that the limitations period begins to run only
when the cause of action accrues, in other words, here,
when exhaustion is complete and the plan has rendered
its final decision.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I find it very hard to
answer the question that is presented here without
knowing the answer to the preemption question that I
asked Mr. Wessler.  And I know you refer to it in a
footnote in your brief and you say that this -- the type
of State statute to which I referred would likely be
preempted.  And I can understand why you wouldn't want
to go further than that on that question in a case where
that question isn't squarely presented.
But if it's not presented, then I think we
would be creating an incredible mess that Congress would
not have intended.  So I really don't understand how I
can answer the question here without knowing the answer
to the question there.
MS. ANDERS:  I think that's -- I think
that's right and I think State laws that require plans
to have this sort of provision would be preempted.  They
may fall within the savings clause, but, as this Court
has said, even statutes that are within the savings
clause are still subject to ordinary contract preemption
principles.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Those are general
statutes, so they would be preempted just in this class
of claims.  So lawyers would have to know that this
statute is still valid for many purposes, but not for
ERISA.
MS. ANDERS:  Well, it may be valid for many
State law purposes, but when a plan is regulated by
ERISA, ERISA's remedial framework establishes the limits
of what that plan --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then you have -- you
have lack of uniformity within the State on when these
claims must be brought under an insurance policy.
MS. ANDERS:  I don't think there'd be more
-- any more lack of uniformity than there is already.
In fact, most of these State laws, they -- they actually
require plans to provide substitute language that would
be at least as favorable to the insureds.
So, for instance, you could have a plan -- a
plan could easily remedy the problem we have here by
saying our limitations period runs from 3 years from
proof of loss or 6 months from the plan's final
determination, whichever is -- is later.  That would be
an easy way for a plan to both be uniform and avoid the
problem that we have here, which is undermining ERISA's
remedial framework by setting the two --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it hasn't undermined
the framework.  I mean,the Petitioner had a year.  I mean,
I can understand if -- finding that a particular case
is -- is not filed too late when indeed there was --
there was no time to do it.  But here they -- they had a
year.  Why -- why does that undermine the framework?  If
and when they don't have enough time, the court can say
the -- this suit is not precluded.
MS. ANDERS:  Well, in this case we now know
post hoc that -- that the Petitioner had about a year.
But the problem with this framework is that it actually
sets the required exhaustion procedure under 1133 and
the required judicial review under 1132 against each
other, because a claimant who is going through
exhaustion is not going to know while she's going
through the exhaustion process how much time she's going
to have remaining.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What evidence do you have
that any bad incentives -- you know, any bad effects are
actually flowing from this?  There's actually a big
leeway in this statute, because it's 3 years.  The
administrative review process only takes about a year.
Even if this is a -- it's a complicated case where
there's some tolling, you know, maybe it gets you up to
another year, you still have a year.
I mean, what -- how would people behave
badly or behave in ways that you think would disrupt the
statutory scheme, if we just let everything stay as it
is?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, first, I think there is
evidence that there have been -- that there have been
problems created by this kind of scheme.  There's an
example of a case in which exhaustion took 4 years.
This is an iterative process; the Department of Labor's
regulations, of course, mean for mainstream cases to be
resolved in about a year.  But you can always have cases
-- you know, these are situations in which you need
medical exams, you need test results, you need written
reports.  Either side --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now -- in practice -- in
practice, how often is that the case that the -- that
the guidelines set by the Department of Labor are not --
are not met?
MS. ANDERS:  I don't have precise
statistics, but the regulations are designed to be
flexible, precisely because there will often be cases in
which one or the other side will need an extension.  And
so there are many cases or at least there are some cases
here where -- where if the limitations period is 3
years, it takes -- it has taken over 2 1/2 years for
exhaustion to occur, so the -- the plaintiff is left
with about 5 months to sue.  And then there's a question
about whether that's reasonable or not which leads to
collateral litigation.  There are some cases where the
statute of limitations is only 1 or 2 years.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I could be more
troubled by this case if the proof of loss provision
required a suit to be brought in a year because as I'm
adding up the timeframe, it's about 15 months if no
exceptions remain for the administrative process.
Could you answer my question on whether you
see any impediment if we rule against you in this case,
to the department saying something like, you've got to
give at least a year, from the finality of the
administrative process?  Could you pass such a
regulation later?
MS. ANDERS:  I think the Department of Labor
would have that authority to do that. I mean, we think the
statute is clear right now that, you know, several
provisions -- there are several concepts here that I
think are very clear.  One this mandatory exhaustion in
the statute.  Two, Congress enacted the statute against
the traditional limitations rule, which means that the
statute runs from the date of accrual, and deviating
from that would undermine the structure by causing the
limitations provision to work in a way that limitations
provisions never do.  Limitations provisions are
designed to create certainty for both parties, so that
you know when you have to bring suit.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, Ms. Anders, the
question is -- there is a division in the courts of
appeals, and the question is:  Could the Department of
Labor, by regulation, resolve the matter one way or the
other?
Does -- even if -- even if it thinks the
statute is clear, the courts obviously don't because
most go the other way.  So given that most courts go the
other way, does the Department of Labor have authority
to adopt a -- a regulation that would adopt the accrual
rule?
MS. ANDERS:  We do think it would have that
authority and it has that authority because it has the
authority to regulate the claims process and the
procedures --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's -- that's the
internal claims.  Do you know any other instance in
which -- when a suit can be brought in -- in Federal
court will be determined by an agency?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, we --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  An agency saying you've got
to sue within 1 year, you've got to sue within 6 years.
Offhand, I can't think of any, and -- and I think it
goes well beyond what -- what the Executive is
authorized to prescribe.
MS. ANDERS:  Well, we do think the agency
would have the authority here because we think that the
statute of limitations -- when the statute of
limitations runs from is intertwined with the
effectiveness about -- of the claims procedure.  So
because we think that the -- that having the limitations
provision run from before exhaustion even starts
undermines the efficacy of the claims procedure, the
Department of Labor would have the authority to protect
the efficacy of the claims procedure --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You know any other
instances where -- where a Federal agency has, in
effect, prescribed the running of the statute for the
courts?  Maybe there are some, but I don't know of any.
MS. ANDERS:  I can't tell you right now.
I'm not sure that there aren't any such provisions.  But
we do think the department would have the authority
here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess one question is, if
you think that you do have authority and you think that
the majority rule has been creating problems, why the
Department of Labor hasn't done that?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, the department's focus --
in 2000, the last time it regulated, it chose to focus
on matters that were directly involved in the claims
process itself.  It hasn't regulated since then, but its
position is that the statute does not permit plans to
deviate from bedrock limitations principles like this
and undermine the remedial scheme.  So its position is
reflected in our brief and we think it could regulate.
JUSTICE ALITO:  If we agree with you, would
a State legislature have the authority to pass a statute
setting out a particular -- a specific statute of
limitations for ERISA claims?
MS. ANDERS:  I think it -- I think it might
have the authority to do that so long as the statute
were framed in a way that didn't undermine the -- the
remedial framework here, yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is your position on
Justice Breyer's suggestion that the trigger can be
proof -- when you file proof of claim, but if it happens
that beginning of suit at that point would -- while
the -- while the administrative review process is
underway, why not say you have to follow the time of
filing, but if the administrative process -- in your
case, the 4 years -- took 4 years -- just hold the suit
in abeyance until the administrative process is
complete?
MS. ANDERS:  I think that would be kind of a
bizarre scheme that would turn the exhaustion process
and the point of exhaustion on its head, and that
essentially would require a rush to court by claimants
who don't know yet whether the exhaustion process will
be resolved in their favor.  And the point of exhaustion
is -- is to avoid unnecessary suits like that.
So I -- I think it has that problem.  It
also is not clear that every claimant is going to know
to -- to file a protective suit.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- What about our saying that, and
what about our saying to the courts as a judge-made
doctrine, exhaustion has to conclude in enough time so
that they have time left to file a lawsuit?
MS. ANDERS:  I'm sorry.  If you were to rule
that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Because isn't --
isn't exhaustion a judge-made doctrine?
MS. ANDERS:  It is a judge -- it is a
judge-made doctrine, but I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It would be an unfair
process that doesn't leave them a reasonable amount of
time to file a lawsuit.
MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think in this case
exhaustion is -- is established by statute, it's
required by statute and by the regulations.  And so, you
know, I think -- I think in this case the problem is
that the statute of limitations starts running well
before the exhaustion process is complete, and
therefore, damages the efficacy of that process.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Carroll.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE M.A. CARROLL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. CARROLL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Subject to State insurance law, ERISA gives
employers broad leeway to choose the terms on which they
agree to provide benefits, and a suit for benefits
due under an ERISA plan can seek only to enforce those
agreed-upon terms.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They don't have to provide
benefits at all, do they?
MS. CARROLL:  Exactly.  But one of
Congress's purposes --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if they do, they do it
on their own terms.
MS. CARROLL:  That's correct,
Justice Scalia.  And that was one of Congress's
overarching purposes in enacting the statute.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I suppose the problem here
is that we have found nine cases -- you know, we can do
computer-assisted research, which my clerks are good
at -- and -- and they found five cases in which the
exhaustion period was actually longer than the 3-year
statute of limitations.  And then they found four others
that were -- well, there was like 5 days left in one,
and there was 5 months in another.  And in most of
-- almost all those cases, the judge got around the
problem by saying the statute begins to run at the time
the exhaustion is finished.
Now, I can think of other ways of solving
the problem.  One was, you get a reg.  Another way was
that we interpret the exhaustion doctrine to require
leaving at least a year.  But what's your way of solving
the problem?  Are you just going to let those nine
people just -- they can't bring their lawsuit, or what?
MS. CARROLL:  Well, I think when those
situations arise -- and to be clear, we have 40, almost
40 years of experience under ERISA of these provisions
coexisting with the ERISA remedial framework.  And in
that time period, to come up with, I recall, was it five
or nine cases --
JUSTICE BREYER:  The question was, what do
you want to do with those nine people?  Now, I know
there are a lot of ERISA cases, but still there were
nine people --
MS. CARROLL:  Of course.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- who will have this
problem.  And my question is, what do you suggest we do
about them?
MS. CARROLL:  In the highly unusual
circumstances where those situations arise, and we don't
have any reason to believe they are anything but highly
unusual, we think courts are well equipped to apply the
same equitable doctrines that courts have always applied
to statutes of limitations when situations like that
arise.  I think my friend referred to --
JUSTICE BREYER:  My question was, what
specific doctrine or -- I saw three routes.  Now, you
can name some others, and we do about those nine people
precisely, not in some general terms, but we do what
about them?
MS. CARROLL:  In the Lamantia case cited in
the reply brief, the doctrine that was applied was
equitable estoppel because in the facts of that case you
couldn't get to a four-year point without a final
decision without something having gone wrong.  And in
that case there was --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And now, I suppose -- so we
could use equitable estoppel, even though nobody has
said anything, even though nobody held out anything as a
basis for estoppel.  But we could say use equitable
estoppel.  I'll think about that one.
Is there any other thing we could use?
MS. CARROLL:  There are many.  I want to
be clear.  Estoppel applies where the facts support it,
as do equitable tolling, as do the several provisions in
the Department of Labor regulations that already account
precisely for the interaction between the internal
review process and --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why wouldn't equitable
tolling apply if you don't have enough time to prepare
the court suit?  You have just a month, let's say, and
it's not your fault because you pursued the
administrative proceedings vigorously and promptly.  Why
wouldn't it be applicable?
MS. CARROLL:  I think it very well might,
Your Honor.  I don't see any reason why that is not a
perfectly adequate solution.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So these seven people, nine
people -- how many were there?  Over 40 years, they
probably had a way out?
MS. CARROLL:  I think that's right.  And I
think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're pushing
this start to the statute of limitations period, and
your answer to the problems is:  Well, don't worry.  If
it ever turns into something that's going to be
enforced, we won't enforce it, or it won't be
enforceable without a judicial determination about
equitable estoppel and all these other things that are
very difficult to apply.
MS. CARROLL:  Our position is that this
limitation provision, like any limitation provision,
whether contractual or statutory, is subject to
equitable doctrines that might apply on the facts of a
particular case.  These are not novel doctrines that
courts are unaccustomed to applying and we don't think
that they are particularly difficult.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Carroll, what would you
think if the State here just amended its statutes
tomorrow and said not 3 years but 18 months?  So for
everybody, it's an 18-month period.  It doesn't give
people very long after the 12 or 13 months of the
administrative review process is over.  What should a
court do then?  Should a court strike the entire
statute?
MS. CARROLL:  Strike the -- strike the State
statute?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Should the court say,
that's unreasonable, that goes too far?
MS. CARROLL:  I mean, I -- going back to the
preemption analysis that Justice Alito referred to, I
think that provision would clearly fall within the
saving clause, and the thrust of this Court's ERISA
implied conflict preemption cases has been to ask only
whether the State law purports to supplement or displace
the exclusive remedial scheme under ERISA.  And I don't
think that provision would.
Now, maybe there would be a new analysis we
would have to ask, which is, does this provision provide
a reasonable opportunity for full and fair review, and
does it practically deprive claimants of the opportunity
to obtain judicial review at the end of that period.
And maybe we would have --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  You know what?
Take it out of the statute context.  Just say that the
contract said 18 months rather -- so -- so that's really
what I meant.  What is -- what's a court to do with a
contract that says that?
MS. CARROLL:  I think -- I think we would
apply that same analysis of asking, has there been a
reasonable opportunity for full and fair review, and has
the claimant been deprived of the opportunity to seek
judicial review?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but in 18 months. I mean and
so 18 -- the administrative review process takes about
12 months in most cases.
MS. CARROLL:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is 18 months enough?
MS. CARROLL:  I think that would be a much
harder case because I do think we -- I think our -- our
experience with ERISA provisions generally does suggest
that exhaustion can take, you know, usually about a
year, maybe a little over a year.  And so that would be
a harder case.
It's not what the laws of the vast majority
of States do require, though.  And it's not the
provision that's in this policy.  And I think just as
there can be line-drawing in that direction, there could
be line-drawing questions asked of my friend, what if --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well but, what's the rule of
law -- what's the rule of law that allows us to get rid of
a contract provision that's set at 14 months or
15 months or 16 months and to leave this one?
MS. CARROLL:  Well, I don't want to -- if
I -- if I -- if I suggested that I wanted to completely
concede that, I misspoke because I think it's a hard
question.  I'm not sure what the answer is.  But I think
the applicable --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I was thinking that I would
like to -- like, 14 months would just seem unreasonable
to me.
MS. CARROLL:  Okay.  Well, I think that's --
I mean, going back to the Riddlesbarger decision and
Wolfe, this Court has long recognized the common law
principle that contracting parties may agree to a
limitations provision, it must be consistent with the
statutory framework, and it must provide a period of
time for suit that's not unreasonably short.  And I
think the Court could apply --
JUSTICE BREYER:  There, your opponent is
saying, I have a simpler answer.  I mean, instead of
having to worry whether 14 months is too long or
7 months is too short or a year and a half is adequate
time, instead of having to worry about that in difficult
cases, I have a simpler idea.  We will just run the
three years from the time the -- the internal exhaustion
is finished.  Then you don't have to worry about it.
You don't have to worry about equitable tolling, and you
don't have to worry about all this other stuff.  That's
their point.
MS. CARROLL:  Justice Breyer, the question
before the Court is not what would be the best idea or
the best, most simple model if we were writing on a
blank slate.  The question is, is this term in an ERISA
plan, in a suit from which the Petitioner's rights flow
from that plan and her cause of action seeks to enforce
the terms of that plan -- may that provision be excised
from every plan in which it appears in all cases on a
categorical basis because we can imagine the possibility
of five or nine cases in which its operation had to be
addressed through the application of traditional
equitable doctrines.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would -- why would
employers with ERISA plans be hurt by the rule that the
Petitioner is advocating going forward?  Why wouldn't
they just be then able to amend the plan, make the --
the period for filing suit begin on the -- at the end of
the review process, shorten the period, if -- so as to
bring it in line with basically what happened before,
when the period began upon the proof of loss, I don't
quite understand why, going forward, that is -- is a
disadvantage to -- to employers?
MS. CARROLL:  I do think that the current
wording of the provision has a lot to recommend it, and
that's why you see it used as the typical model in
insurance.  And here are a couple of the things.  One is
that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  The current model being the
proof of loss?
MS. CARROLL:  Being proof of loss.  And that
is --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And why is that preferable?
MS. CARROLL:  That is because, from the
moment the claim is filed, we know at the outset that
the claim -- the books can be closed on the claim for
reserving purposes three years from the proof of loss
date.  Whereas, under a limitation period that does not
commence until the conclusion of the administrative
process, we won't know from the outset when the
limitation period will run or not.
And so this provision provides some
certainty that the other type of provision doesn't.  I'm
not saying --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't it true that in
insurance contracts, generally, where there is this
proof of loss as the trigger, there isn't a mandatory
administrative -- most States don't have this mandatory
administrative review.
MS. CARROLL:  Justice Ginsburg, that's
actually not correct, and we've provided some examples
at pages 20 to 21 of the red brief that show how these
provisions do commonly work in the traditional insurance
context.  And what you commonly see is a limitation
period, often about 12 months, that will run from the
time of the insured loss, let's say the time of the fire
in a fire insurance policy.
What subsequently must happen within that
12 months is that the claimant must present proof of
loss within the 12 months as the clock is ticking.
Sometimes they must await the insurer's decision.
Sometimes they simply have a waiting period.  And then
they have to file suit.  And that was the -- that was
the scheme that this Court discussed at some length in
the Wolfe case.
And what that model is about is -- I mean, I
think we're all very familiar with the kind of Federal
administrative scheme where there are several steps of
administrative review, followed by a judicial review
step, where Congress writes a limitation period that's
essentially a grant of time in which a claimant can
proceed from one step to the next.
But that's not the only model, and it's not
the model that characterizes the insurance practice.
With that model -- the way that often works is there is
a deadline out there in the future, and by that deadline
a claimant must complete the pre-litigation steps
necessary and file their claim.  That's the type of
model that this court also considered in enforcing the
McMahon case.  And there's nothing in the law that says
one model versus the other is the only way a limitation
period can ever be written.
And in ERISA, Congress did not step in to
decide what it thought the limitation period ought to be
or how it thought it ought to work.  It instead said,
number one, we want to defer to State insurance
regulators, even though these provisions had long been
on the books already, we want to defer to State
insurance regulators to govern the content of insured
plans.  And number two, we want to defer to employers'
decisions about the terms on which they want to enter
into the voluntary undertaking of providing benefits.
And it is a voluntary undertaking and
Congress, speaking about concerns about uncertainty and
so on, the primary uncertainty that Congress was worried
about and that would be visited on employers and
insurers if this Court were to -- were to rule for
Ms. Heimeshoff, would be that we don't want to be in a
legal regime where every term in an ERISA plan is
potentially unenforceable because someone can imagine a
handful of five or nine cases in which it's unfair.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but there's
no -- there's no employer who is going to have a plan
put together and say, well, I'm not going to do this
unless the statute of limitations for claims runs from
the proof of loss.  And if you tell me it's got to run
from the exhaustion of remedies, I'm just not going to
give a benefit plan.  That's an implausible scenario.
MS. CARROLL:  I -- I think that it's a
broader point, however, in terms of the uncertainty that
this would raise.  To -- to say that this provision
should be excised from ERISA plans in all plans where it
appears, for all cases because of speculation about what
might happen in some cases but does not usually happen,
to say that that can be a basis, absent any other anchor
in the statute, for judicially rewriting or ignoring
plan terms, would be a tectonic shift in the law of
ERISA in terms of Congress's goal of making sure that
plans would be enforced as written, particularly in a
cause of action under Section (a)(1)(B), which is a suit
not to defeat the plan terms, but to enforce the plan
terms.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, what would your
argument be if -- if this -- if ERISA said there is a
minimum 3-year statute of limitations?  Would your
argument be identical today or would that be a clearer
demonstration that Congress intended that the background
principle that that starts from, the exhaustion of
administrative process, be incorporated?
MS. CARROLL:  Under the -- under the
principle this Court recognized in Riddlesbarger and
Wolfe, parties to a contract may agree to a limitation
period that differs from one in the governing scheme.
So, for example --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So do you require an
explicit agreement that the start is going to be
different as well?
MS. CARROLL:  An explicit agreement --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That you can shorten or
lengthen a limitations period, but this is not about
shortening or lengthening a limitations period.  This is
about changing a start time for the limitations period.
Do you require something explicit -- an
explicit statement as to that as well?
MS. CARROLL:  Your Honor, if I am
understanding the question correctly, I think if you --
if you begin from the premise, as I think all parties
do, that -- that contracting parties may agree to the
length of the limitation period --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right.
MS. CARROLL:  A limitation period -- a
length of a limitation period can't be defined or
expressed without reference to some starting point.
It's not the norm to say, oh, we're going to have a
3-year period.  You would say it's 3 years from some
date.  It's 3 years from proof of loss or 3 years from
notice or 3 years from discovery or 3 years from my
decision --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you think Congress
would only legislate in that way?
MS. CARROLL:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You think Congress would
only legislate that way?  Do you have any examples of
that, of Congress saying the limitations period starts
at the end of the administrative process and is for 3
years or 1 year?
MS. CARROLL:  Well, typically, Congress
writes limitations periods that run from the time the
"cause of action," accrues, which is why this Court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's much better.
MS. CARROLL:  -- usually has to decide when
the cause of action accrued.  But that's not always the
case.  So in the Dodd case, for instance, the limitation
period in the Federal habeas statute is not drawn to
anything having to do with accrual, but to a -- a menu
of a series of particular events.
And the same thing is true under this
provision where the parties, rather than defining the
limitation period by reference to the accrual of a cause
of action, they have defined it by reference to a
particular point in time, which is a model that is
common in -- in the insurance practice and has been
widely used in ERISA plans since ERISA's enactment.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have any position on
whether the executive can prescribe when -- when suit
must be brought?
MS. CARROLL:  I -- here's how the Department
of Labor has threaded that needle, and that is in the
provisions of the regulations that say things like, if
an ERISA plan provides for additional voluntary appeals
beyond the minimum that's necessary, then the plan must
agree to -- not to assert any defense based on the
statute of limitations or timeliness.  And so I think
that sort of approach is probably something that they
could do.  I mean, I think that probably avoids the
question that Your Honor was asking earlier.
I think, you know, as far as the DOL's
regulatory authority more generally, I think there is
also the looming question about whether the Department
has statutory authority to adopt a regulation that would
have the effect of preempting State law.
But leaving those authority questions aside,
I think the only other question is whether the
Department could compile a factual record that would
provide a non-arbitrary basis for taking this action.
I -- I'm not sure that they could, but it's certainly
within their right to initiate notice and comment
rulemaking to try to do that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Carroll, did I
understand you before to be taking the position that
even if Congress enacted a statute of limitations with
an accrual rule, that that might not be effective as
against a plan provision that provides for the trigger
being proof of claim?
MS. CARROLL:  I -- I think it would be a
question of statutory interpretation there whether the
inclusion of a particular statute of limitations was
meant to limit contracting parties' ability to agree to
a different one.  And I think if you had a situation
where, you know, let's say the Court in this case
upholds the plan's provision and then Congress amends
the statute to say, you know, we really think this
doesn't make sense and we want to have a different rule,
I think there would be a strong argument that that
statute was intended to foreclose, as Congress may do,
the right of -- of parties to contract around that rule.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're not going to do
this for a lobby of nine people, are they?
MS. CARROLL:  I -- I wouldn't expect so.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But if they do that, the
question answers itself.  The -- the --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  The -- the question I would
like to know is if you know empirically, roughly, what
are typical statutes of limitations in this area?  The
basic rule is State law unless contract, is that right?
MS. CARROLL:  I -- I think that's right,
yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And how long on average?
Do you have any idea of -- of how long people normally
have to bring their action?
MS. CARROLL:  Well, the 3 years from proof
of loss is the standard provision.  So that is typical.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's the standard provision
in contracts?
MS. CARROLL:  Yes.  In -- in certain types
of insurance contracts, yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean -- in certain
types of insurance contracts.  So ERISA is all over the
place.  I wouldn't even know where to start.  Does the
Department of Labor keep statistics on this or what?
MS. CARROLL:  I -- I have -- I -- we have
looked far and wide for empirical information about this
and the best I can do is to refer Your Honor to page 29
of the amicus brief for the American Council of Life
Insurers, which does collect a little bit of empirical
information about the exceeding rarity with which this
issue ever arises in ERISA cases and the typical length
of time that's required to exhaust.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's hard to
see what you mean by the exceeding rarity.  I suspect
there are more than nine cases where people are looking
at the running of the statute of limitations and they're
saying, well, I've got to sue if I don't get this and
when do I have to hire a lawyer.  And the last thing you
want in this process is to get lawyers involved at the
claim procedure.  And they say, well, there's only 10
months left, I'd better hire a lawyer, you know, and
instead of the informal resolution, you've suddenly got
lawyers involved.  Why isn't that a legitimate concern?
On the other hand, if you wait until the
claim is exhausted, you may -- you may not need the
lawyer at all.  But if you don't know when that period
is going to run, you'd better get one early -- sooner
rather than later.
MS. CARROLL:  Well, of course in this case,
the Petitioner did have counsel from relatively early on
in the process.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, she was very
prudent.
MS. CARROLL:  So I'm not sure that --
Pardon?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, she didn't
know when it was going to run, you'd better get somebody
in there right away.  The typical lay person who's got a
claim for $9,000 in disability benefits or whatever, you
know, may not know.  Better get a lawyer to tell her.
It just seems to me that you keep it as an
informal resolution -- inexpensive resolution process if
you tell somebody look, you don't have to worry about
getting a lawyer until we tell you whether we're going
to deny your claims or not.
MS. CARROLL:  And, Your Honor, that easy,
inexpensive process is how it works in the vast majority
of cases.  I think something like 80 percent of
disability claims are granted through the internal
review process without there ever being any need to go
to litigation.  And I think the reason --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's my
point.  I'm not talking about the need to go to
litigation.  I think there are probably more than 9
people who had to hire lawyers before they even had a
decision.
MS. CARROLL:  Oh, I think that's right.  I
mean, this is not -- I think our best sense is that
there's something around the order of about a quarter to
a third of cases in which claimants are represented by
counsel.  But I think the question that Your Honor is --
is posing, of the claimant who's approaching some point
where they are wondering what to do, that's going to be
a claimant who's looking at a deadline for filing suit
that is probably still a year and a half or two years
away in typical cases.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, and it's
probably a claimant that doesn't have all that much
experience with the legal system and doesn't know well how long
does it take, you know, to get a complaint ready and --
I don't know.  It just seems to me that the problem of a
statute of limitations that runs before the claim even
accrues requires people to worry about their legal
rights in a way that -- the simple rule about when your
benefits are denied, that's when the period starts
running.
MS. CARROLL:  Well, I mean, granted all
statutes of limitations do impose some obligation on
would-be plaintiffs to take steps to protect themselves.
That -- that is true of all limitations periods no
matter how they are drawn.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's fair to say, in other
words, that it's typical in the insurance industry that
statute of limitations run from proof of loss?
MS. CARROLL:  In the group -- in the group
benefit plans of the type that are subject to ERISA,
that is very common.  That is the standard term.  Going
back to the older products like fire insurance, life
insurance, and so on, it would often run before proof of
loss, from the actual insured event.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  From occurrence?
Occurrence --
MS. CARROLL:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And with
-- the reason why it's different in a long-term
disability plan is that you have to make sure that the
disability is actually a long-term disability.  And so
that's why you have these elimination periods followed
by a proof of loss deadline because there has to be a
sustained disability in that interim period.  And so you
don't run it from an earlier point because it's not
clear that the insured event has occurred until you've
come to that point.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you started to answer
this question before, but I'm not sure I understand the
answer, why this proof of loss model is -- is so
attractive in the disability insurance field?  You said
that it provides a clear date on which you know you can
begin to count.  But so does an accrual rule.  So maybe
you can explain a little bit more.
MS. CARROLL:  I -- I think what I meant by
that was that under what I take Your Honor to mean by an
accrual rule, meaning a limitation period that runs --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Right, right.
MS. CARROLL:  -- at the conclusion of the
administrative process, we don't know at the time that
the claim is initially presented when that's going to
be.  Is it going to be 6 months from now?  A year from
now?  A year and a half from now?  And so it's just simply
for reserving purposes, it helps to have a greater sense
of certainty about the timing of potential claims and
when we can close the books. -
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's -- the doctrine of
exhaustion is a judge-created doctrine.
MS. CARROLL:  Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And therefore you cannot,
in your contract, contract yourself around it.  You
can't get out of it.
MS. CARROLL:  No.  And --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So what this would require
would be to say that that judge-created doctrine
requires exhaustion to take place before the accrual of
the statute of limitations, end of opinion.  For the
reason of certainty, for the reason of uniformity, for
the reason of avoiding, through hiring lawyers, et
cetera, an interference with the voluntary nature,
simple nature, and hopefully pre-legal involvement
nature of that exhaustion process, all right?  Da, da,
da.
Now, the reason -- what trouble would that
cause?
MS. CARROLL:  The --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What trouble in the
industry would that cause?
MS. CARROLL:  The -- that trouble -- that
would cause trouble for every employer, plan sponsor,
insurer that has an ERISA plan.  And here's why.  Since
ERISA's enactment, this Court has never held that in a
suit to enforce the terms of an ERISA plan those terms
can be thrown out the window because we worry that they
might be unfair in some case that we can speculate
about.
That would be a very significant shift in
how this Court enforces ERISA plans, and it would
undermine Congress's goal of wanting to assure employers
and plan sponsors that the terms on which they agree to
provide benefits will be respected.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought that this
contract required exhaustion of administrative remedies
before you can sue.  Isn't that in the contract?
MS. CARROLL:  It is.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it's not a judge-created
doctrine.
MS. CARROLL:  It's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, we create it in
other instances where -- where there are agency, you
know, requirements to go through the agency, and we --
we make it up.  But here it's -- it's in the contract,
isn't it?
MS. CARROLL:  It is in the contract.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So we are not as entitled
to fiddle with it as much as we are when it is our
creation, I suppose.
MS. CARROLL:  Well, but even when it is the
Court's creation it is not without exceptions, it is not
jurisdictional.  We like exhaustion.  We think -- we
think that internal review is a very successful and
workable scheme that resolves the vast majority of cases
with mutual benefits to all sides.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Carroll, please tell me
if I'm wrong.  But even if a contract does not have an
exhaustion requirement, courts have required exhaustion.
MS. CARROLL:  That's -- that's correct, for
good reason, although with exceptions.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And courts have required it
even though the statute doesn't say so.
MS. CARROLL:  That's true.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's an extra-textual
requirement the courts have made up, irrespective of
what the contract provides.
MS. CARROLL:  That's true.  But it is not
one that required setting aside or defeating any term of
an ERISA plan.  And that's the key distinction.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Did I --
MS. CARROLL:  And as the party that has come
forward to say that even though I am trying to enforce
this plan, I nevertheless want to jettison the plan
terms, I think the Petitioner bears a burden to say
there is some anchor in the statute or some basis in
evidence or experience to say, not simply to speculate,
that there is a potential clash with the remedial
scheme, but that there is one.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think what Justice Breyer
was suggesting, that maybe, given that we have this sort
of judge-made rule of exhaustion, that the courts just
did a sort of a half job of it, that they also should have
put the statute of limitations that makes that
exhaustion requirement work, and that ensures that it
doesn't produce unfair, bad outcomes.
MS. CARROLL:  I think if there is a -- if
there is a question as between a judge-made doctrine and
the terms of a plan as to which should give way, I think
Congress has made clear that it is the terms of the plan
that ought to control, as has this Court made clear.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  The Congress was dealing --
you know, Congress passed ERISA before this exhaustion
requirement came into play.  So it's a little bit hard
to read into anything, to read Congress's silence in the
normal way here because Congress didn't think that there
was going to be this exhaustion requirement --
MS. CARROLL:  I --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- and the courts put it on
later.
MS. CARROLL:  I'm not sure about that.  I
think the courts that found an exhaustion requirement
did so in an act of statutory interpretation and found
that to be consistent with Congress's intent in the
statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Did I understand --
did I understand you earlier to say we have not had a
case where we have overridden plan terms in ERISA plans?
MS. CARROLL:  In a -- in a suit under
section 1132(a)(1)(B) to enforce a plan term, there is
no decision in which this Court has said we can simply
ignore plan terms. Rather what,
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, simply ignore.
I mean, is there any in which we have overridden plan
terms?
MS. CARROLL:  No.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.
MS. CARROLL:  No.  There are no -- there
have been plenty of cases where people have asked to do
so, and where this Court has had to say -- for example
in the -- in the Amara case, in the McCutchen case, in
the Kennedy case, where the Court had to consider
situations where maybe we should come up with a
judge-made sort of common law model that seems like a
better rule.  And the Court said, no, we are not going
to do that because this is a situation.  This is a
context where Congress wanted plan terms to control.
Here the plan terms clearly bar the suit.
There's no allegation that the -- the
administrative regime here was --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Look, you agree that we
would overturn the plan term if the plan term was no
exhaustion?
MS. CARROLL:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE BREYER:  The courts would overturn a
plan term which plan term said no exhaustion.
MS. CARROLL:  I -- well, I doubt very much
you would ever encounter a plan term like that.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course not because what
we are trying to do -- and employers are very
cooperative and we are trying to work out a system with
the exhaustion thing that will not destroy ERISA plans
or something.
MS. CARROLL:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It -- it's which is the --
and that's why I phrased it in terms of an explanation
of the exhaustion requirement.
MS. CARROLL:  Yes.  I suppose if you had an
intransigent plan that just said, no, we refuse to
entertain your attempts to appeal, that is a situation
where a court would apply one of the futility exceptions
to exhaustion.  So I -- I don't think that would --
would present an issue.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MS. CARROLL:  Thank you.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W.H. WESSLER,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WESSLER:  Thank you.  Just a few -- a
few brief points.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, you have
4 minutes left.
MR. WESSLER:  Thank you.
First of all, this Court has in UNUM v. Ward
refused to enforce a plan term that would have
overridden a State law notice prejudice rule.  But I
think the bigger point here is that provisions that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What case is that?
MR. WESSLER:  UNUM v. Ward, Your Honor.
The bigger point here is that provisions
that tamper with ERISA’s enforcement scheme, as this
provision does, are inconsistent with ERISA's remedial
structure.  By Respondent's own argument, this is not an
enforce the contract provision.
This is a sometimes enforcing the contract
provision, that is itself automatically subject to a
reasonableness override, in which courts can and are
expected to actually decline to enforce the plain
language of the provision in cases in which it finds,
under a host of fact-specific questions, the provision
is either unreasonable or the plan is estopped
from enforcing it or has waived it.
And that, we submit, Your Honor, is the key
defect with this provision because it puts courts right
in the center of policing what should be a private
process.
If plans are -- if Courts are able to look
back and determine whether a plan's conduct in the
internal process was -- was unreasonable, was dilatory,
was unreasonably delayed, then all of a sudden the
private benefit resolution process, which this Court has
said, as have all of the lower courts that have looked
at it, is designed to be non-adversarial, flexible, and
private, turns into something that looks like none of
those things.
It turns into a process in which lawyers get
involved early, in which courts get involved early, and
in which these plan terms are subject to revision or
over -- overrides in a host of cases and in which both
plans and claimants have no idea ex ante whether or when
this provision will be enforced.
A rule running from final denial, which I
should say is the consistent rule across the board in
every Federal statutory regime, stated -- going back
from -- to the beginning of the law that we have been
able to find, runs the limitations clock from when you
can file the claim in court.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if we agree with you,
would the Federal courts and maybe ultimately this Court
in the end have to specify what the statute of
limitations is, the length of time?  So we have a bunch
of cases from different courts, and one circuit says 2
years is -- is the -- that's the shortest you can have.
Another one says, no, you can have a year.  Another one
says, well, you could have 9 months.
How would this ultimately happen?  Wouldn't
we be driven to that?
MR. WESSLER:  I -- I think not.  I think
plans have absolute authority to -- to themselves
specify the length of the period.  We see this --
JUSTICE ALITO:  They specify a lot of
different lengths, and then they're all challenged --
different ones are challenged in different courts, and
the courts have to say what's reasonable.  And there's
no State statute of limitations that applies to this
situation.  So it all comes down just to a question of
reasonableness.
MR. WESSLER:  I think that -- I think two
answers to that, Your Honor.  First, I don't think
that's actually correct.  Most plans that run the length
only do about a one year from -- from final denial.
As Respondents themselves have -- have
explained, and we agree, courts across the board find
one year in almost every context to be reasonable.  And
so it would automatically be enforced.
But the difference also is in the type of
reasonableness inquiry that a court would have to apply
in -- in the case that you're suggesting, which is not a
fact-specific inquiry based on how long the parties took
to pursue this internal process.  It's simply an
objective question.  Is the amount of time on the
limitations clock enough to allow a plaintiff to file
her claim in court?
And one month -- excuse me.  One year from
final denial would absolutely be enough time, would
provide all parties under ERISA with the certainty that
they have to -- to file their claim.
Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
