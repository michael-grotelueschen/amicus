CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
next in Case 13-1333, Coleman v. Tollefson.
Mr. Shanmugam.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
Under the three strikes provision of the
Prison Litigation Reform Act, a prisoner who has three
prior dismissals on prior occasions must pay the full
filing fee before bringing suit.  While the three
strikes provision specifies what types of dismissal
qualify as strikes, it does not expressly specify when a
dismissal counts as a strike.
The better view is that a dismissal does not
count until it becomes final on appeal.  That view is
consistent both with the text of the three strikes
provision and with the PLRA's underlying purposes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does that include a
petition for cert or is it only the first level appeal?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  The time for the filing of a
petition for cert would count under our view, which is
to say that a dismissal would not qualify as a strike
until that time is complete.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So until there's a
petition filed and it's denied or until the time expires
to file the petition.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  That is correct.  And that
is a quite familiar rule, Justice Ginsburg.  It is the
rule that this Court has applied with regard to the
running of limitations periods for habeas petitions, for
example, in Clay v. United States.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure, it is.  But if -- if
that were the case, why -- why would the statute have to
refer separately to dismissals for frivolousness by the
district court or by the court of appeals?  You could
just -- it could have just said, if he's had a petition
dismissed for frivolousness period, and that would mean
it would have to go all the way up.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It separately says by the
district court or by the court of appeals.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  It is certainly true that a
qualifying dismissal by a court of appeals, like a
qualifying dismissal by a district court, qualifies as a
distinct strike.  And so, therefore, a prisoner could
get two strikes in a single case.  But we would
respectfully submit that that really tells us nothing
about the separate question of when those dismissals
count as strikes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I think on your
theory, he wouldn't get two, he'd just get one.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  No, that is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The -- the dismissal is
simply not final until the court of appeals acts, and
that's one dismissal.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  But there would still be two
dismissals.  And let me explain how our interpretation
works, because I think that this is an important --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  I understand what
you're saying, but it doesn't make any sense.  It
doesn't make any sense for Congress to want a finality
rule and yet to count it twice.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  I don't think that there is
any inconsistency.  And let me explain why that is so.
In our view, the critical phrase in the statute is the
phrase "prior occasion."  And to be sure, an occasion is
triggered at the point at which a dismissal is entered.
But in our view, the occasion is not complete until the
appellate process has run its course.
So in a case in which a district court
enters a qualifying dismissal, that is to say, a
dismissal on the ground that the action is frivolous or
malicious or fails to state a claim, the occasion is
complete only when the appellate process runs its
course.  And so, too, when the court of appeals, if it
enters a qualifying dismissal on those similar grounds,
a separate occasion is initiated by the dismissal and
it, too, ends when further review is complete. Now what
that means --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why do you say that?  Where
do you get that out of the word "occasion"?  I would --
I would think "occasion" means at any time prior,
whether it's at the court -- whether it's at the
district court or the court of appeals.  You -- you read
it.  Why can "occasion" only mean what you suggest?  Or
mean what you suggest, period?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  We don't believe that it
could only mean what we suggest, which is to say that we
don't think that the text precludes an interpretation
under which the occasion is coterminous with the act of
dismissal.  We simply don't think that is the only
possible interpretation of the statutory language.
For one thing, we think that it is notable
that the statute does not provide that a mere affirmance
of a district court dismissal qualifies as a distinct
strike.
So, in other words, in a case in which a
district court dismisses on one of the specified grounds
and then the court of appeals simply affirms, I think
everyone would agree that there is only one strike.  And
in our  view --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Shanmugam, would you
explain that distinction from the court of appeals
level?  So the district court dismisses for failure to
state a claim.  It goes up to the court of appeals.
When would the court of appeals simply affirm and when
would it say "appeal dismissed"?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  So, Justice Ginsburg, when a
district court dismisses for failure to state a claim, I
think that the ordinary course would be for a court of
appeals to affirm.  While the statute refers to
dismissals on the ground that the underlying action is
frivolous or malicious or fails to state a claim, we
think that the failure to state a claim ground really
only properly applies on the district court level.
To come at it from another direction, the
circumstances in which courts of appeals dismiss appeals
rather than affirming are circumstances in which the
appeal itself is frivolous or malicious.  So in a
circumstance in which a court of appeals merely affirms,
there is no discrete strike at the court of appeals
level.
And in our view, to get back to Justice
Scalia's question, that fact, the fact that a mere
affirmance does not count separately, in our view,
strongly suggests that the dismissal and the ensuing
appeal should be viewed as a single unit.  The only
circumstance in which a court of appeals action counts
as a distinct strike is when the appeal itself is
frivolous or malicious --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Shanmugam, I find it as
one of the appealing points in your argument that you
have a dismissal for frivolousness at the District Court
level.  It's counted as a third strike, and then that is
reversed on appeal.  So that, you know, turns out it
shouldn't have been the third strike.  And I don't know,
what do you do in the last case?  In the next case he
has only two strikes.  That is a messy situation.  How
often does that situation arise?  How often is it that a
District Court dismisses for frivolousness and is
reversed by the Court of Appeals?  Do you have any idea?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  So, more often than you
might think, Justice Scalia, and itâ€™s for the simple
reason --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I hope so, because I don't
think it happens very often.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  It is certainly true that
there are not a lot of cases, as the Federal government
points out, in which a Court of Appeals outright
reverses.  But I think it's important to emphasize, that
a Court of Appeals can also modify a District Court
dismissal.  And so if, for instance, a Court of Appeals
concludes that a District Court erred by determining
that the action was frivolous, or malicious, it is not
uncommon for a Court of Appeals to say, That
determination was incorrect, we're going to remand for a
determination about whether or not there was a failure
to state a claim.  We cite a number of those such cases
in our reply brief.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In a case such as
that, is there anything preventing the Plaintiff from
getting a stay of the District Court judgment?  The
third strike, seeking a stay of the judgment, and if in
fact it is because of a failure to state a claim, so has
more merit than one of the frivolous ones, I suppose the
Court of Appeals could grant a stay, and the problem
we're addressing would totally go away.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  So, neither Respondents, nor
the Federal government suggest that that is a
permissible solution.  We have identified a couple of
District Court cases where District Courts have entered
stays.  I would respectfully submit that the concept of
a stay is a little bit counterintuitive in this context.
Because, I think what a District Court would essentially
be doing is saying that it isstaying the grounds on which
it disposes of the case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, but that's a
problem that is always presented when you have to ask a
District Court to stay its own judgment.  But you can
also ask the Court of Appeals, right?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Right, but you're not really
staying the dismissal in that circumstance.  What you
would really be doing is staying the consequences of the
dismissal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, you just stay the
judgment.  Because the judgment -- I mean, that's the
typical reason you ask for a stay is because the
judgment is going to have some very adverse consequences
that should be suspended pending appeal.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I'm a little
confused here.  There's no judgment to be entered if the
prisoner can't file because of the third strike.  There
is no complaint to stay, and there's no judgment to
stay.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  I think, Justice Sotomayor,
if I'm understanding the Chief Justice correctly, that
what the Chief Justice is suggesting is that a District
Court when it enters the potential third strike it
somehow enter a stay of the disposition and what I'm
submitting is a little bit counterintuitive about that,
is that what the District Court would essentially be
doing is entering the dismissal because after all, the
dismissal would need to take effect but at the same time
saying that in essence the collateral consequences of that
dismissal are not immediately going to take effect.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The remedy will be
stayed in effect, of the third strike.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, but the only remedy is
the disposition of the case and so, again, I think that
that is why this idea really hasn't gotten --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you suggesting
that the District Court cannot stay the disposition of
the case?  Or that a Court of Appeals asked to review it
or going to be asked to review it can't stay it?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, but the only
consequence of the case here is the actual act of
entering the dismissal.  So this is not a circumstance
in which, for instance a court affirmatively provides
relief, whether it's a monetary judgment or injunctive
relief, and then says that that is not going to take
effect until the appellate process is complete.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It says the dismissal will
not take effect.  Why can't it say the dismissal -- you
know, we think you deserve to be dismissed but weâ€™re going
to enter a stay so you can go up and see if we were right.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yeah, again, I don't think
that there is a lot of precedent for this even in the
jurisdictions that have adopted respondents or the
Federal government's interpretation.  But let me just
say one --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I actually don't even
-- I hadn't considered this, because we --
appellate courts have no jurisdiction until there's a
final judgment.  There's no 54(b) -- there's no 54(b)
standard that would be met and there's no anything
standard that would be met.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  I mean, in essence what you
have to do is to prevent the very judgment from becoming
a judgment, because of course at the moment --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, isn't
that what stays do?  They suspend the effectiveness of
the judgment and by doing so you stay any collateral
consequences of it?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, what they tend
to do, Mr. Chief Justice, I think, is to really stay the
relief that is being provided until the appellate
process runs its course.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem here is not
that case.  The problem here is the next case, if there
is one.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, that is correct.  And to
get back to Justice Scalia's question, because I just want
to make sure that all of the consequences of the various
interpretations are on the table.  I think that there
are actually two sets of pernicious consequences here.
The first is the one that you
identified here, which I think is a problem both with
respondent's and the Federal government's
interpretation, which is what to do in a circumstance in
which a prisoner is effectively barred as a result of an
erroneous third strike, a third strike that is reversed or
modified.
I think with respondent's
interpretation, there is a much more fundamental
anomaly, which is this anomaly of precluding appeals of
dismissals that count as the third strike.  And so again we
are not arguing today --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought in this case
there was no such preclusion.  I thought that the Court of
Appeals said, yeah, we'll take the appeal on the strike.
So that's -- that's -- you can't urge that issue because
you prevailed on it.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  But that is a problem,
Justice Ginsburg, that I think inheres in the
interpretative question that is before the Court.  It is
certainly true that petitioner is not in that position.
In other words, we're not here trying to get the right
to appeal from the third strike dismissal.  But I do
think that it is a problem that has to be dealt with in
construing the statutory provision and itâ€™s a problem that
has been recognized by every court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it has to be dealt
with under anybody's interpretation.  Once you admitted,
which you must, that in one case there can be two
strikes, then if there's a second case, a third case, or
no, a second case, but a third strike at the District
Court level, you still have to face the question of
whether there's a right to appeal --
MR. SHANMUGAM:  But, Justice Sotomayor,
under our interpretation, all of these anomalies are
dealt with for the simple reason that you wait until the
end of the appellate process and even those courts, those
two Courts of Appeals that have gone the other way on
this issue have recognized this anomaly.  It's really
only respondents who think that this anomaly is no big
deal.
Now, there have been various solutions
devised to this problem.  The Sixth Circuit, the Seventh
Circuit and Federal government have all come up with
different interpretations of the relevant statutory
language in order to address the problem.
I want to specifically address the Federal
government's proposed interpretation, because no one
before this Court is defending the exact reasoning of
either the Sixth Circuit or the Seventh Circuit.  The
Federal government argues that the phrase "prior
occasion" should be construed to mean a prior dismissal
in a different case.  Now, that certainly addresses this
anomaly, but we simply don't think that you can get that
interpretation out of the phrase "prior occasion."  And
so while there may be textual ambiguity here,
and I would certainly acknowledge as I did to
Justice Scalia that the text of the statute does not
unambiguously preclude respondent's interpretation, we
do believe that it unambiguously precludes the Federal
governmentâ€™s interpretation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you saying the
government is being illogical or inconsistent, because
if strike number 3 is a District Court ruling, the
government says, well, there's no bar to your appealing
that.  There's just a bar for filing a new District
Court suit, and you would say that that's just illogical.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, we think that that is
something that Congress could logically have done.  We
simply don't think there is any footing in the statutory
language for that distinction.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If prior occasion  means
what it means, then there's only two strikes anyway
because there was or two prior cases or two prior --
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Under our interpretation,
that is certainly true and, of course, it bears
emphasizing that this is the interpretation of the
overwhelming majority of lower courts who have considered
the issue.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  By the way, how many of
those courts count the time or rely on the time for
cert?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  You know, I'm not sure that
all of the Court of Appeals opinions have expressly
dealt with that issue simply because the cases haven't
quite been postured in that position.  We think that
that rule makes sense because that is the ordinary rule
that is applied for instance when this Court is
construing statutes that expressly require finality on
appeal, and that's the Clay versus United States case
that I referenced earlier.
Of course that time is not likely to be all
that extensive particularly in cases in which the
petitions plainly lack merit the time to resolution of
petitions of that variety is typically relatively short.
But my point here is simply that under our
interpretation, there really have been no identified
problems with administrability and after all --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?  I mean, what they
argue is if we take your interpretation, it has to be final
to become a strike, all that takes time, and if you have
a really real frequent filer during that year, perhaps
you will file 38 more cases or maybe a hundred and there
will be no way to stop him really.  You'll have to pay
for the -- you know, I mean, you see the problem.
On the other hand, the evil that you're
worried about, which is that there is a reversal of a
strike on appeal, has happened precisely zero times.
Ever.  So this sort of undermines the statute.  There's
not a real need for it, your interpretation, and if
there were by the way and it were reversed, he could
proceed under Rule 60(b)5.  So that's basically their
argument.  I would like to hear your answer.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Sure.  Well, Justice Breyer,
let me start with the problem that we are addressing
here.  And I would note that it's the two-fold problem.
Again, it's the problem of prisoners who are barred as a
result of erroneous third strike dismissals, and there
are such cases.  It's not a null set.  Even the Federal
government acknowledges that there are at least two
reported cases in which that has occurred.  And again,
we point out that there are cases in which there have
been modifications, and those modifications would also
be cases where someone under the interpretations on the
other side would go from having three strikes to two
strikes.
But let me address the perceived vices with
our position as well.  I think really the only vice that
has been identified is this supposed floodgates problem
that's going to ensue under our interpretation where a
prisoner, on the eve of a third strike, is suddenly
going to come in with a flurry of lawsuits.  I would
note at the outset, that that is a potential problem
really with any interpretation.
In other words, once you set the rules for
what constitute three strikes a prisoner -- when the
prisoner has two strikes, will have an incentive to come
in with a number of different lawsuits.  So I don't think
that that problem really disappears under any
interpretation.  But again, that's not a problem that
seems to have been borne out.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, wait.  Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.  I mean, what's distinctive about
yours is you have to wait for the period of the appeal.
You have to -- and, you know, that could take a long
time.  And you talk about floodgates.  The reason this
statute exists is because of floodgates, because these
prisoners file one -- one frivolous appeal after
another.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Two points in response to
that, Justice Scalia.
First of all, even under Respondent's
interpretation, where a prisoner has two strikes, a
prisoner could come in with a flurry of lawsuits, and it
seems to be undisputed that you assess whether or not a
prisoner has three strikes at the point at which the
prisoner submits the complaint.  And so a prisoner could
bring a flurry of lawsuits even under that
interpretation.
But second, and more importantly, I think
there's a reason why this problem hasn't borne out in
practice, and that is simply by virtue of the other
provisions of the PLRA.  Even a prisoner who is not
subject to the three strikes provision still has to pay
the filing fee, albeit in installments, and that filing
fee, of course, is substantial.  It's now $400 in the
district courts.  It's now $505 in the courts of
appeals.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Shanmugam, why isn't
this case just a casebook example of what the danger is?
Because this Petitioner, as I understand it, filed not
only the petition that's before us, but three more.  In
what span of time?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Over the span of about a
year and a half.  But I would note that it took my
client, who has been in prison in Michigan since 1983,
25 years to get to three strikes even under Respondent's
interpretation.  So I think that this effort to -- to
create the impression --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but he's making up
for lost time.
(Laughter.)
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, he did file four
lawsuits.  And as a result, he does have to pay the
filing fee in installments for each lawsuit, and that's
20 percent of his income.  And in addition, district
courts are not somehow left without tools in the event
that those subsequent lawsuits are meritless.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but I don't -- I
don't think that your earlier point that when he has two
strikes he can file a flurry of suits is relevant.
That's -- that's the grace period that the government
has given him.  The government has granted that with
only two strikes, you can proceed.  But now we have
three, and that's quite different.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, and of course, that is
the question.  And the question really is whether
Congress, in imposing this sanction, which is a
considerable one in which of course applies to
meritorious and meritless claims alike, whether Congress
would have wanted to attach that consequence before
ensuring that a prisoner, in fact, had three valid
dismissals for pursuing meritless claims.
And, of course, we have a statute here that
does not specifically address that issue, and there are
plenty of statutes that address that issue in both
directions.  And we also have no legislative history for
those members of the Court who are interested in
legislative history that speaks to this issue.
And so the real question we would submit is
that if the Court agrees with us that the language of
the statute is at least ambiguous, which interpretation
avoids anomalous consequences and leads to a rule that
is easy for lower courts to administer?
The great virtue of our interpretation is
that once a prisoner has three strikes, the prisoner
always has three strikes.  You don't have this specter
of the possibility that a prisoner could go from having
three strikes one day to having two strikes or fewer the
next.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you know if any of
those courts, the majority of the courts except for two,
have opted  for addressing things your way?  And -- and
I have a slight leaning towards letting the majority of
circuit courts figure out administrative -- the ease of
administrative rules.  How many of them thought of it as
just being easier to do?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I think that when you
look at the court of appeals' opinions that have gone
our way, a number of them have recognized that the text
is ambiguous.  So they have not just been, as Respondents
and the Federal government suggest, somehow disregarding
the language of the statute.
The Fourth Circuit in the Henslee case
specifically relied on the phrase "prior occasion" and
said that, "The phrase prior occasion may refer to a
single moment or to a continuing event to an appeal
independent of the underlying action, or to the
continuing claim, inclusive both of the action and of
its appeal."  And that's, of course, precisely the
argument we're making today.
But with regard to administrability, I just
want to be clear about how this works, because this is
obviously a very important practical issue for district
courts.
Under our interpretation, all that a
district court, or for that matter a court of appeals,
need do is to look to see whether in a prior case there
has been a determination that a prisoner has three
strikes.  If, in fact, that is so, that is the end of
the analysis.  And indeed, our understanding is that in
many jurisdictions, the district court clerk's offices
actually keep lists of people who have been subject to
the three strikes prohibition.
There's a decision from the Western District
of Louisiana that refers to the keeper of the three
strikes list, and our understanding is that that is
actually a fairly common practice.  And, of course,
where a prisoner has not previously been subject to the
three strikes provision, it will be relatively easy, and
it's a familiar task for a district court to make the
determination whether a prisoner's prior dismissals are
final on appeal.
Under Respondent's and the Federal
government's interpretations by contrast, there is no
such ease of application because a court will not be
able to be sure that a prisoner, in fact, has three
strikes even if the prisoner has previously been barred.
And under either of the interpretations on the other
side, you will have to figure out what to do in a
situation in which a third strike dismissal has been
reversed or even modified.
Now, the Federal government --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Again -- again, that's a
big problem depending upon how frequent that is.  If
it's once in a blue moon, you know, it's no big deal.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, everyone before this
Court agrees that we're not exactly dealing with a large
set of cases to begin with.  And the question presented
in this case is not going to affect a large number of
cases in the aggregate.  Though I would note that the
issue has arisen in virtually every single one of the
courts of appeals.
My point is simply that you're dealing with
a somewhat larger number of cases than the Federal
government would suggest.  When the Federal government
says look, we've only been able to identify two cases
where there have been outright reversals.  And to the
extent that the Federal government in its brief points
to the reversal rate in civil actions by prisoners, the
Federal government accurately represents that that rate
is about 4 percent.  I think it's important to emphasize
the fact that the overall reversal rate in the Federal
courts of appeals is only 7 percent.  And so it isn't as
if the prisoner rate is, you know, somehow orders of
magnitude lower.  And of course --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I would think that the
-- I would think the situation that we should be concerned
about is the situation in which the dismissal, which is
initially counted as the third strike, ultimately
results in some relief for the prisoner.  And I don't
know that there's even one of those.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, but, of course, under
the statute, the dismissal no longer qualifies even if
the prisoner doesn't obtain relief.  And I think
everyone agrees that if there is either a reversal or
vacatur of the dismissal or a modification to eliminate
the grounds specified in the statute, that the dismissal
no longer has any effect.  And those cases, I would
respectfully submit, are somewhat more common than my
friends on the other side would have you believe.
And I would like to reserve the balance of
my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
Mr. Lindstrom.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. AARON D. LINDSTROM
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. LINDSTROM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The plain language of Section 1915(g)
identifies when a strike occurs.  It occurs when an
action or appeal was dismissed.  The phrase "action was
dismissed" has an everyday meaning and the ordinary
meaning of "action was dismissed" does not.  Action was
dismissed and affirmed.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Lindstrom, I -- I
understand that argument, and it seems to me a very
natural reading of the statute.  But the -- I'm troubled
by the scenario where it's dismissed and then it's
reversed, not for these practical reasons that people
have been talking about.  But it seems to me that if you
were really reading the statute that way, that that
would count as a strike, too, and that that strike would
not go away even when it was reversed.
And so I'm wondering whether the statute is
actually a little bit more ambiguous than -- than you
are suggesting, because at the very least, I mean,
everybody agrees that you have to make an exception for
that case, and it seems to me that on your reading of
the statute, that case would be included.  A strike
would be a strike even if it's reversed.
MR. LINDSTROM:  No, Justice Kagan, we think
the ordinary rules that apply to judgments apply.  When
Congress passed this statute, they weren't trying to
change the ordinary rules of how judgments are applied.
The ordinary rules in district court judgments matter
until they're reversed.  That's the ordinary rule in the
res judicata context and in every other context.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but that's something --
you're now appealing to some default principle that
exists outside of the statutory text.  I can't find any
basis in the statutory text for that result.
I mean, it's -- there have been three or
more prior occasions in which either an action or an
appeal has been dismissed.  Now, one of those dismissals
was later reversed, but it was dismissed.  And so on
your reading, we -- we really, you know, it's -- it's --
your reading is kind of -- this is the natural reading,
but we're not going to -- we're not going to apply the
natural reading in a case where it obviously doesn't
fit.
MR. LINDSTROM:  I think we're assuming that
Congress is drafting against the ordinary background
rules, and there's an ordinary meaning of what's
dismissed, and that's what my colleague is changing --
is challenging.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem with the
ordinary rule is that it really doesn't apply completely
until the next case.  It applies in that case, but it
doesn't apply in the next case.
MR. LINDSTROM:  If you mean it doesn't
apply, I guess I'm not sure what you're saying.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Meaning let's talk about
res judicata or collateral estoppel.  If it's res
judicata, it's the two parties.  So that -- that's that
case, essentially.
MR. LINDSTROM:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If it's collateral
estoppel, it could be until a third party.  But I think
that that third party would be entitled to a stay of his
or her action pending the adjudication of the main
action.
MR. LINDSTROM:  But we do know that Congress
did want to cut off IFP status in the same case in at
least some instances.  If you look at
Section 1915(a)(3), that specifically says that an
appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis status if the
trial court certifies in writing that it was not taken
in good faith.  That's not -- that's setting aside the
three strikes rule entirely.  That could happen in any
given case.  And that shows that Congress specifically
wanted to cut off IFP status on appeal in at least some
cases.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except that the --
there's still a right to ask the court of appeals for a
COA, and so there is an appellate process of sorts.
MR. LINDSTROM:  There -- there would be, and
that's correct.  But in terms of what the background
rules are, I think the ordinary rule of the background
interpretation would be you start with the plain
language.  Congress expects you to look at the word "was
dismissed," figure out what that means.
They would also expect you to apply the
ordinary rules that apply to judgments, and the ordinary
rule is that district court judgments matter.  They have
a legal effect immediately.  You can see this from
trivial matters, like when interest starts to accrue,
and also through very significant matters, such as a
criminal conviction.  If somebody is a convicted of a
criminal -- of a crime in Federal court, they get to go
to jail, even though they're pending in --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right.  Answer -- answer
Judge -- Judge Easterbrook's point, that there is no way
to revive a subsequently filed case that was dismissed
because of a third strike.  Judge Easterbrook, and I
think there's some force to his logic, says with this --
this three-strike situation, when the next case comes to
the court of -- to a district court, district court
never files the complaint.  There was nothing dismissed
that can be revived.  There was no judgment entered.
MR. LINDSTROM:  That wouldn't have barred any
of the four lawsuits that Mr. Coleman could have brought
in this case, because he could have brought all four of
his lawsuits in State court.  He could have filed each
one of these in State court.  So there is recourse,
interpreting the statute according to the plain
language.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But -- but there's no
remedy for the fact that subsequent lawsuits that
were -- that were filed based on the erroneous third
strike would have been turned back without the filing of
a complaint.
MR. LINDSTROM:  In other words, it was never
filed, so there was nothing to relate back, at which
point --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And nothing -- or to
file a 60(b).
MR. LINDSTROM:  But, again, it -- there's an
easy way for a prisoner to get around that, and the
prisoner could have done that by -- once he's got three
strikes and the last one is on appeal, he has to make
the decision:  Should I file my next four cases that I'm
going to file -- should I file them in Federal court, or
should I file them in State court?  And this statute is
saying you shouldn't file them in Federal court.
I think -- I'm not sure if I fully answered
your point about reversal, but I think that's the
ordinary background rule.  Again, even though a prisoner
would be convicted, they still go to jail even though
there's the possibility that a reversal might happen.  And
the ordinary rule is that a reversal is something that
is if it had never occurred.
You can see that in the -- as some examples
cited in the Federal government's brief about
sentencing, if you have a conviction that is then
reversed, it can no longer be used to enhance a later
conviction.  There's double jeopardy context, where if a
conviction is reversed, then it's as if it never
happened, which is why in Ball v. United States, this
Court said you can retry the person.
So the plain language, both in the "was
dismissed" language and the action or appeal, they
show that Congress is talking about the filing fees,
that the context of this statute, I think, is really
helpful.  It's about filing fees.
When you enter the district court, you have
to pay a filing fee to file a complaint.  And then on
appeal, you have to pay a filing fee so you can file
your notice of appeal.
So what Congress is doing is saying, these
are the two events we're talking about, and if you have
brought an action that was dismissed or brought an
appeal that was dismissed, that lines up with these two
stages of litigation.  It was trying to separate them
out and treat them differently because Congress was
trying to deter not just frivolous actions, but also
frivolous appeals.  It includes language, "action or
appeal," in the statute.
an appeal?
costs $505.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What does it cost to file
MR. LINDSTROM:  In the Federal courts, it
JUSTICE BREYER:  Sorry?
MR. LINDSTROM:  $505, Your Honor.  In State
courts it's less.  So you'd have are that option, and
you also have the IFP status option in State courts as
well.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sort of an interesting
question, basically admitting that in terms of your
time, the suits would still remain because they could
file in State court?
MR. LINDSTROM:  Yes, I think they could file
in State court.  That's what the plain language of the
statute, it doesn't say anything about -- to preclude
State court.  And there's other outlets as well that
would --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do states have similar
rules?
MR. LINDSTROM:  States do have similar
rules.  And Mr. Coleman has not run afoul, as far as
we can tell and as far as he has reported in the
complaints that he filed, which are all in the joint
appendix.  He hasn't filed anything in State court.  So
this would not have precluded him from filing all four
of his lawsuits in this verycase.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, I guess what
I'm not quite sure about in your answer to my question,
Mr. Lindstrom, is, if I understand you right, and tell
me if I don't, you're basically saying that we look to
these background principles and we decide that a strike
doesn't happen if something is reversed on appeal, so a
strike is kind of dependent on what happens on appeal.
But when you say that, aren't you kind of giving up your
best argument?  I mean, aren't you then admitting that
the notion of a strike encompasses what happens on
appeal and encompasses finality on appeal?
MR. LINDSTROM:  We don't think it does.  I
think Congress is looking at the filing fee stages.  It
was looking at the fact that you're going to file a fee
at the district court level and at the appellate court
level.  So the statute clearly draws a distinction
between the two and wants them to be treated separately
so that if you get the IFP status in the district court,
that's one thing.
Getting IFP status in the Federal court is
another thing because what's going on here is Congress
is granting a subsidy to prisoners to allow them to
pursue further litigation, and Congress simply drew a
line in the statute saying, We'll subsidize a certain
number of these -- of IFP appeals and actions before we
cut it off.
There's other statutes that also show that
if Congress wants to delay the legal effect of a
district court judgment, it knows how to do it.
Section 2244 which we cite in brief good example of
this.  It was passed by the same Congress that was
considering the Prison Litigation Reform Act.  It was
considering it at about the same time throughout the
1995-1996 time period.  Congress was voting on both
parts.  And in Section 2244, it said something doesn't
count, doesn't have a legal effect with respect to a
statute of limitations until it's final by the
conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the
time preceding such review.
So the exact same Congress threw out the
words that was dismissed, knew how to write a different
rule and didn't do it here.  And that's very telling,
especially given how they were enacted within two days
of each other.
So this Court itself has stopped in forma
pauperis status appeals, so some of the concerns that
are being raised are the fact that district court
decisions could be ossified errors.  They could be
depriving people of meritorious claims.  But that
concern would be worse with respect to petitions that
are filed in this Court because if this Court cuts
somebody off and says you can't
file any more petitions, as it does under
the Martin case.  Then after that, there's a much
greater case of ossification because those decisions may
be precedential.
So I think that our reading is consistent
with what Congress is trying to do, which is to look at
the great bulk of the cases and say 95, 96, some high
percentage of cases, those are going to be cases where
the original strike was affirmed, and so it's a very
remote possibility.  If the language were completely
ambiguous, then you would still have to figure out which
one is closest to Congress' intent, and Congress' intent
would be to address the 95-plus percentage of cases, rather
than the case where my colleague admits there are not a
lot of them and hasn't really cited very many of them.
JUSTICE ALITO:  This is a question I
probably should have asked petitioner, but what do you
understand his -- what do you understand him to mean
when he says it has to be final on appeal?
Suppose that there is an appeal pending in
one of the prior strike cases, but it's perfectly clear
that the notice of appeal in that instance was filed
woefully out of time.  Would that be final on appeal?
MR. LINDSTROM:  I think it would -- I assume
his answer would be to look at, once the notice of -- I
think he would say the end of the expiration of time is
when the court would look at it.  So if it was filed
late, the expectation would be if it's filed out of
time, because you're looking at the time period for
review, that time period has passed and it's final, I
guess subject to reopening if there's a way to get
around that.  It would be jurisdictional.  So I don't
know how you would get around it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under your position, I
suppose we don't have to ask about certiorari, pending
whether or not that --
MR. LINDSTROM:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You can say that that's
the petitioner's problem, not yours.
MR. LINDSTROM:  I think that's right.  I
don't think I need to address that.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you think about the
government's argument about the third?  You imagine he
has -- the prisoner has filed one, dismissed as
frivolous; appeal, the dismissal affirmed.  That's one.
Now he does it again.  That's two.  And he does it a
third time.  District court dismissed.  And he says, I
want to appeal that, and I don't want to pay the $500,
505.  And the government has to say -- could say, sorry,
you have to pay the 505.  That's the third, because he's
a separate.  Then he says, but it says, "on a prior
occasion," and this is the same occasion.  And therefore
he doesn't have to pay the 500.  What's your view of
that?
MR. LINDSTROM:  I think that that reading
takes the word "prior" and changes it from meaning
"before" to meaning "before or after in a separately
filed suit."  So I think it's going too far with what
the word "prior" could possibly mean.
That "occasions" -- I mean, the whole point
of the statute is to identify what occasions are going
to give rise to a strike.  And those occasions are when
an action was dismissed, which is a district court
event, or when the appeal was dismissed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to
me the government does give away too much in that
position.  The only question is whether that undercuts
this whole argument.  It gives a little bonus for the
appeal of the -- if strike number three is the district
court, the government doesn't count the appeal, as I
understand it.  It counts -- obviously it counts in a
later district court suit, but not here.
MR. LINDSTROM:  Yes, Your Honor.  And I
should be quick to point out that they agree with our
interpretation of the facts of this case, where he had
three strikes and then he filed -- it's about the
subsequent actions.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why use the word
"occasion" at all?  Meaning:  What meaning do you give
to that word?  Why didn't they just say "three
dismissals"?
MR. LINDSTROM:  I think the statute -- I
think "occasions" is just kind of a way of framing the
long clause that follows after it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It seems to me you could
have just said, if a prisoner has three dismissals,
then -- three prior dismissals; not three prior
occasions, three prior dismissals -- he can't get IFP
thereafter.
MR. LINDSTROM:  I don't think that would
change the outcome in this case, because that language
still would remain.  His action was dismissed -- or
appeal.  It was dismissed.  So the language that draws a
distinction between the court of -- the district court
level and the appellate court level would still be
there.  I mean, "occasions" is just identifying those
two, what those two occasions are.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What about the fact that
this provision refers to a prior occasion on which an
action was dismissed?  If you put "prior" and "action"
together, isn't there the suggestion that youâ€™re talking
about an action that is different from the action that
is before the court of appeals in what is arguably the
third strike?
MR. LINDSTROM:  That word would also carry
through to prior appeal, apparently.  I think the "prior
occasions" is simply talking about the fact that it is
an action that happened before.  I don't think that that
word would have to modify both.  It doesn't make sense
that it would modify "prior appeal" as well in a way that
is distinguished from the appeal in this case.  In both
events you'd be talking about anything that goes before
it.
If there are no further questions, I will
yield the time to my colleague from the federal
government.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Kedem.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MR. KEDEM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
If I could start with the issue of finality
and the normal background principles, the argument that
petitioner makes, and this is echoed by the argument
that he makes in pages 9 to 10 of his reply brief, is
that sometimes Congress specifies that finality is
required and sometimes it specifies that finality is not
required, and so we can draw no negative inference from
the fact that Congress was silent here.
But if you look at the example of the
statute in which Congress specified non-finality that he
gives, it's actually not a statute at all.  It's a
Federal rule of evidence.  Moreover, petitioner
identifies no instance in which Congress has a statute
in which it is silent about whether or not you require
finality, like subsection G, and yet finality was
implicitly read to be required; in other words, no
instance in which a finality requirement was inferred
rather than expressed.  And even if you think that
sometimes finality might be able to be inferred,
Section 1915 is an especially bad candidate, because it
distinguishes so repeatedly and so sharply between the
trial and appellate stages.
And that brings me to petitioner's single
occasion theory, articulated most clearly in pages 18 to
19 of his opening brief.  It's the idea that a trial
court dismissal plus the appeal from that dismissal
constitute a single ongoing occasion.  And if Congress
had that in mind, presumably it would have used some
sort of process-oriented language.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't that what the court
of appeals held here?
MR. KEDEM:  Pardon?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The court of appeals said
you do get the appeal from the third strike.
MR. KEDEM:  Yes, the court of appeals said,
we believe incorrectly, that the appeal from the third
strike is the same occasion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is that before us?
You -- I thought that this appeal is about the fourth
case, and that you haven't -- you haven't contested the
court of appeals' holding that you do get an appeal from
the third strike.
MR. KEDEM:  We don't believe that's directly
at issue and we can talk about it if the Justices are
interested in that.  But the question as to how to read
"occasion" and whether it encompasses just the trial or
the appellate stage, or both of them at the same time,
is very much at issue in this case.  And we believe that
you could end up with overlapping occasions, not only
the trial court dismissal, but on appeal, also a
separate appellate dismissal, which, as Petitioner
concedes, is an occasion in its own right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's -- that's the --
why I asked the question on page 25 of your brief; you
say the bar goes into effect if the prisoners received
strikes on three or more prior occasions.
Now you say a prior occasion is not the
district court dismissal in this third case.  That's not
a prior occasion.  But when you look at the earlier two
strikes, you don't consider it as a whole.  So we
consider this one as a whole, but we don't consider the
others as a whole.  That's why I asked the question.
MR. KEDEM:  The question, Justice Breyer, is
whether the prior occasions that might prevent you from
appealing a civil action includes that very action, the
one you're trying to appeal.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it doesn't -- yes, it
does.  Because the dismissal of -- by the district court
of this lawsuit after it's done is a prior occasion.
The present occasion is your appeal of that dismissal to
the court of appeals.
MR. KEDEM:  Justice Breyer, it's important
to consider the posture you're in when you're making
that choice.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not saying it's good
policy or anything.  I'm just saying it's hard for me to
see how you can say the one and not the other.
MR. KEDEM:  Because at the time that you're
making the decision, a new occasion hasn't started.  You
have to decide whether the prisoner is allowed to file
the IFP appeal.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Good.  And when we're in
the second one, when you file the appeal from the first
one, the new occasion hadn't started.  So we're still in
the middle of the occasion.
MR. KEDEM:  No.  Justice Breyer, the prior
occasion has concluded.  It concluded with the issuance
of the judgment of dismissal.  Let me provide an analogy
that, hopefully, can articulate our position.
Imagine that a school had a policy that said
in no event shall a student retake a test if on three or
more prior occasions that student had taken and failed a
test.  Now, I suppose you could read that policy to say
that the very test you want to retake is a prior
occasion that might prevent you from retaking it.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm going to fail this test
because --
(Laughter.)
MR. KEDEM:  We don't think that's the
natural reading.  And moreover, in order to give
independent content to the word "prior," it can't simply
mean before the very decision when you're making the IFP
determination.  Because, of course, you're only taking a
count of strikes that are prior in that sense.  You're
not going to take a count of strikes that haven't yet
happened.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was it your brief that
said there were very few cases -- you found only two
published cases?
MR. KEDEM:  Only two cases, and that
includes cases that are not published.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what my question
was, okay.
MR. KEDEM:  And, of course, it's important
to emphasize, we're not just talking about the problem
of a third strike reversal.  In order for Petitioner's
concerns to come about, you need a -- a prisoner who
wants to file a fourth suit, one that doesn't qualify
for the imminent danger exception and there has to be
some risk of the statute of limitations running in that
fourth suit while the third one is on appeal.
Presumably, that's going to be
extraordinarily rare, if it ever happens.  And even if
it does, we believe in that instance, Rule 60(b)(5)
would allow you appropriate relief.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then answer Judge
Easterbook's point, which is, when the fourth case comes
in, the court is just not granting IFP.  It's not
dismissing the case, it's just not filing it at all.
It's just saying to you, I won't commence the
litigation, I won't accept it without you paying IFP.
MR. KEDEM:  Well, what usually happens is
what happened in this very case; namely, that the court
says, I'm not granting you IFP status and I'm going to
dismiss your case if you don't pay the filing fee.  And
so you could file Rule 60(b)(5) motion to have that
reopened.  Because Rule 60(b)(5) applies whenever a
litigant seeks to reopen a case that was dismissed on
the -- or where the case was based on a prior judgment
that was reversed or vacated, which would seem to apply
here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you -- do you
have to file -- pay a filing fee to go with a 60(b)
motion?  Is that a separate proceeding?
MR. KEDEM:  My understanding is that there's
a circuit split as to whether if you're denied IFP
status, you nevertheless are still on the hook for the
filing fee.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that would
really make your position complicated.
MR. KEDEM:  Your Honor, I think if you are a
prisoner who's three strikes barred and you still want
to file a fourth suit, there might be some consequence;
namely, that you might be on the hook if that third
strike is ultimately affirmed, as most third strikes
are.
I'd like to address also the point that
Petitioner makes that his position is much more easily
administered.  Because I actually think the inquiry is
basically the same on either approach.  It's true that
if you only know that the prisoner is three strikes
barred, then you can rely on that under Petitioner's
approach.
But that's not normally what happens.  What
normally happens is what happened in this very case.
Namely, the trial court lists the prior dismissals, plus
what it knows about what happened to those dismissals on
appeal, and it makes an IFP determination.
And under either approach, the inquiry is as
follows:  For any appellate dismissal or a trial court
dismissal that was affirmed on appeal, you can always
rely on that going forward.  And for any trial court
dismissal where you don't know what happened on appeal,
you simply have to check the appellate docket, something
that, as Petitioner points out, courts are already very
familiar with.  So under either approach, essentially
the inquiry is entirely the same.
And finally, Your Honor, if you are simply
not convinced by the textual arguments and you just want
to know what makes practical sense, you should go with
the approach that works in the vast majority of cases.
And in the vast majority of cases, what happens is what
happened in this very case.  You have a third strike
that was ultimately affirmed on appeal.
Under Petitioner's approach, notwithstanding
that affirmance, even though the Sixth Circuit said that
strike was properly administered, he would nevertheless
be permitted to proceed IFP in those four additional
suits that he filed.  Under our approach, he would not,
because the third -- he would not because he was three
strikes barred.  But if the third strike had been
reversed rather than affirmed, he could have gone back
to the trial court and asked for relief under Rule
60(b)(5).
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And just to be clear,
Mr. Kedem, if we say, you know, we're not buying this
prior occasion thing, does your -- does the rest of your
position stay your position?
MR. KEDEM:  It does.  I think you would end
up with Respondent's position.  But one additional point
on prior occasions.  Although Petitioner disagrees with
our reading of the phrase "prior occasions," he does
agree with us that if Congress meant "prior occasions"
to include an appeal -- to applying the situation from
an appeal of a third strike, it would have said so
explicitly.  So if you simply go with that background
understanding, you would still end up with our position.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Shanmugam, you have four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice:
Justice Kennedy asked Mr. Lindstrom whether
the inconsistency between Respondent's position and the
Federal government's position undercuts the whole
argument here, and we would respectfully submit that it
does.  Let me start with Respondent's interpretation.
I don't think that I could put the problem
with that interpretation better than the Federal
government itself does in its brief where it suggests
that "an interpretation, which precludes even an appeal
from the very dismissal that counts as a third strike,
would be inconsistent with quote,  â€œcommon practice, in
which a litigant is permitted an appeal as of right,
from any adverse district court ruling that is final."
One would expect Congress to have spoken
more clearly if that had been Congress's intention.  And
while in Section 1915(a)(3), Congress specified certain
circumstances under which an IFP appeal is not
permitted, it conspicuously did not bar IFP appeals from
third strike dismissals.
Now, Respondents attempt to mitigate the
harsh consequences of their position.  Wisely, they do
not make the argument that they did in their brief that
a prisoner need only, quote, "buckle down" in order to
earn the $505 filing fee in order to pursue an appeal.
All I heard Respondents suggest was, well, a prisoner
can refile in State courts.  But as Mr. Lindstrom wisely
acknowledged, because Michigan itself has such a
provision, many States following the PLRA adopted three
strike provisions of their own.  And so, I would
respectfully submit that that provides cold comfort.
Let me turn to the Federal government's
interpretation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Including strikes in
Federal courts?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Some States do.  I'm frankly
not sure what the practice is in Michigan, but I know
that many States count dismissals in both sets of courts
toward the three strikes.
Let me start with -- let me address the
Federal government's interpretation very briefly.  I
think it is telling that my friend, Mr. Kedem, did not
start with the government's interpretation of the phrase
"prior occasion."  He instead started with background
principles.  And that is, I would respectfully submit,
for the simple reason that you simply cannot get this
different suit distinction out of the phrase "prior
occasion."  It would lead to the odd result, as Justice
Breyer highlighted in his colloquy with Mr. Kedem, that
a prior dismissal could count as a prior occasion in
some circumstances, but not in others.
Let me address the question of background
principles because that was such the focus of Mr.
Kedem's argument.  We would respectfully submit that
principles differ in the law whether as a matter of
statute or whether as a matter of background principles.
Congress can be explicit in both directions and,
obviously, here Congress was silent.  I think in terms
of nonstatutory background principles, frankly, the
primary principle on which the Federal government relies
in its brief is the principle of claim preclusion.  And
it is certainly true that in some jurisdictions,
consequences attach immediately upon judgment.  That's
not the rule in others.  In California and Texas,
consequences don't attach until the judgment becomes
final on appeal.
But that doctrine serves a quite different
purpose.  The whole point of attaching consequences
immediately is precisely to ensure that a losing party
does not get a second bite at the apple.  Here, by
contrast, you're talking about a provision that applies
consequences in other lawsuits, however unrelated and
however meritorious.  And that just underscores, in our
view, the point that there are different policy
justifications that may require attaching consequences
to a judgment immediately or that may require attaching
consequences only when a judgment becomes final on
appeal.
At bottom, recognizing that there is some
ambiguity here, given the fact that you have three
parties here who are offering different interpretations,
none of which lines up with the interpretation of the
court of appeals below.  We would respectfully submit
that considerations of workability and administrability
ought to be paramount when construing a statute that
governs the processing of Federal lawsuits.  Our rule
has been the rule --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Before
your time runs out, can a case be final on -- can a case
be final on appeal if there is a -- an appeal pending
but the notice of appeal is untimely?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  We believe that in that
circumstance, it probably would be until the Court of
Appeals disposes of the case, because the Court of
Appeals would, typically, eventually dismiss the appeal
