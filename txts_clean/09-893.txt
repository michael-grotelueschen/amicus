CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

Mobility v. Concepcion.
Mr. Pincus.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit concluded in this case
that a State law may mandate the use of a particular
procedure in arbitration as long as the law also
requires the use of that same procedure in litigation.
That interpretation of section 2 of the Federal
Arbitration Act would permit a State to oppose in
arbitration any procedure employed in court and thereby
require arbitration to be a carbon copy of litigation,
precisely what the Act was designed to prevent.
Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act
provides that an arbitration agreement may be held
unenforceable under State law only if the State law rule
being invoked to invalidate the agreement qualifies as a
ground that exists in law or equity for the revocation
of any contract. Respondent argues that, because
California's Discover Bank rule does not facially
discriminate against arbitration, it falls within the
savings clause. But the plain language of the savings
clause makes clear that it is not limited to statutes
that discriminates facially against arbitration.
By referring to "any contract," it makes
clear that, as this Court has said, the rule must be
applicable to contracts generally.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if a State
finds it unconscionable to have an arbitration clause in
an adhesion contract which requires the arbitration to
be held at a great distance from -- from where the other
party is and requires that party to pay the cost of the
arbitration? Can a State not find that to be
unconscionable?
MR. PINCUS: It can, Your Honor, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that wouldn't apply
to other -- to other contracts.
MR. PINCUS: But the legal doctrine that the
State is applying there, as States have and as we
discuss in our brief, is a doctrine that applies a
general principle of unconscionability with principles
elucidating how it applies that apply evenhandedly
across the board.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are we going to sit in
judgment? Are we going to sit in judgment? I know you
say -- you say it has to shock the conscience, but if a
State wants to apply a lesser standard of
unconscionability, can we strike that down?
MR. PINCUS: If it wants to apply a lesser
standard to arbitration clauses, yes, absolutely you
can, because that would -- that would violate what is at
the core of the provision, which is discrimination
against State law.
If a State -- if a State enacted -- if the
legislature enacted a statute and it was headed
arbitration -- unconscionability, rather, and section 1
of that statute had general principles to be applied to
all contractual provisions to determine
unconscionability: It must shock the conscience, the
question is addressed with respect to the party before
the court against whom the contract is going to be
applied, and the third principle is unconscionability is
decided ex ante. And then section B said -- I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the difference,
then, with the act that you are positing? A State comes
in -- or I should ask: Is there no difference between a
State saying these terms in a contract are
unconscionable, making the petitioner always pay the
fees and making him or her arbitrate in a different
State -- that is unconscionable -- or a general rule of
State law that says in a contract of adhesion the
stronger party can't impose undue cost or expenses on
the other side to vindicate their rights, whether it's
in litigation and/or arbitration.
In your mind, there is no difference between
those two things, between these two approaches to the
issue?
MR. PINCUS: I don't think so, Justice
Sotomayor. Maybe if I could finish with my example, it
may elucidate the distinction that I'm trying to draw.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So how do you address
Justice Scalia's -- if you are saying there is no
difference between those two things, then how can a
State find those terms unconscionable? Under what
theory, general theory of law, would they be --
MR. PINCUS: I think the critical question
is: Is the State applying the same principles to
arbitration, of unconscionability to arbitration
agreements, as to other agreements? And in my example I
was positing a first provision that laid out three
principles that would be applied.
If part B of that section, or part 2 of that
section, said with respect to arbitration agreements, on
the other hand, we are going to require that the
procedures be equivalent to what is in court, we are
going to look at the time the dispute arises rather than
ex ante, and we are going to look at the effect on
everyone, then I think it would be quite clear that that
would be discrimination.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That is bad, absolutely,
but that's not what the State is going to do. The State
is simply going to say: We find this to be
unconscionable. And you say it's not unconscionable;
it's very fair. And the State says: Eh, we think it is
unconscionable.
Are we going to tell the State of California
what it has to consider unconscionable?
MR. PINCUS: Respectfully, Justice Scalia, I
don't think that's what the State is doing here. I
think what the State is doing here is saying -- is not
saying, under the same principles we apply elsewhere,
this is unconscionable. They're just saying, it's quite
clear that it's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's nothing --
MR. PINCUS: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is nothing that
indicates that California's laws are applying a
different concept of unconscionability. You haven't
come up and said, oh, look what they did here. And in
--
another case they said it has to shock the conscience.
Maybe across the board, California is
saying: We think that unconscionability should have a
broader meaning. Is it unfair to the weaker party
to the bargain? Is there really no genuine agreement
here? And if that is so, that will fit our definition
of unconscionability.
You don't have anything that says -- the
California court hasn't said: We are applying a special
definition of unconscionability to arbitration
agreements.
MR. PINCUS: Well, they haven't said that,
Your Honor, but their opinion makes clear that they do.
For example, the statute in California that defines
unconscionability specifically says unconscionability
shall be assessed at the time of contracting.
Here, the decision holding the Discover Bank
rule is specifically based on a determination of
unconscionability, not ex ante, when there would be a
variety of situations to consider, but it is explicitly
based at the time the dispute arose.
JUSTICE KAGAN: I was under the impression
MR. PINCUS: So it's clear that they are
applying a different --
JUSTICE KAGAN: I was under the impression,
Mr. Pincus, that Discover Bank specifically cites a case
which arose not in the arbitration context, but instead
in the general litigation context, which is this America
Online case, and thereby made clear that its rule,
however different it may seem to you from normal
contract provisions, its rule applied both in the
arbitration sphere and in the litigation sphere.
MR. PINCUS: Justice Kagan, I think that
question goes to -- to a separate question. I think
Respondent has two arguments. One is, because this rule
applies to all dispute resolution provisions, it is a
general -- it applies to any contract that qualifies
under section 2. We think that that clearly can't be
the case, for several reasons.
First of all, section 2 says "any contract,"
and that, the Court has said, means principles that
apply to contracts generally, not principles that are
limited to dispute resolution contracts.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, this --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, any contract that
would have an arbitration clause.
MR. PINCUS: True, Your Honor. But if the
provision meant that, then as long as -- as long as a
State law banning arbitration said, we are banning
arbitration in any contract, then the State could say it
applied to any contract. Or a provision that said
juries are required to resolve every dispute, whether in
arbitration or not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we criticize one
feature of this? You are not claiming that, vis Ã  vis
litigation, arbitration is being disfavored, which was
the original concern about arbitration agreements and
what prompted the Federal Arbitration Act. The courts
didn't like to have their business taken away, and so
they were disfavoring arbitration contracts.
That is no part of the picture here, as far
as I can see, because the rule is the same whether it's
litigation or arbitration.
MR. PINCUS: Well, we -- we do make an
argument, Your Honor, that the impact of this rule is
much more significant on arbitration than it is on
litigation, because it basically -- with respect to
litigation, it is reaffirming the default rule, but with
respect to arbitration, it has a quite significant
different effect, which is really to transform
arbitration in the ways that the Court described in
Stolt-Nielsen.
And so we do argue that it does have a
disproportionate burden, but our principal argument here
--
is that the "any contract" requirement means that the
State law rule being applied has to be a rule that
applies generally to contractual provisions, as the
Court has said.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but some -- some
elements of unconscionability can only arise in a
litigation or an arbitration context, such as requiring
the complaining party to litigate or arbitrate at a
distant location. How could that possibly apply in --
to any other contracts?
MR. PINCUS: Well, that -- that now turns to
the second argument that Respondents make, which is,
even if the mere fact that it applies to litigation and
arbitration satisfied section 2, the rule satisfied --
satisfies section 2 because it is merely a specific
application of California's general unconscionability
rule.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MR. PINCUS: And -- and our response to that
is: It is quite clear that in three critical respects,
it is the principles that were applied -- not the
result, but the principles that were applied in order to
find unconscionability here -- are different than the
principles applied in every other context. By example
JUSTICE SCALIA: Three? What are the three?
MR. PINCUS: The three are, first of all,
looking to the effect on people other than the parties
to the dispute. In every other case --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I was going to ask you
about that. Right.
MR. PINCUS: -- the question is: Is it fair
to the person before the court to apply the contract to
them? Here, the district court found it was quite fair
to apply to that person; the problem was third parties.
The second issue: When is the
unconscionability decision made? As I said, the statute
says ex ante. Here, the decisions explicitly say: We
are going to look at it at the time the dispute arises.
Third question: The general standard is
shock the -- so unfair as to shock the conscience. Here
the standard is: Is there a deterrent effect equivalent
to a judicial class action?
Three critical differences, three
differences that are not differences in result, but are
differences in the legal principles that are being
applied to determine unconscionability.
JUSTICE BREYER: I thought that Discover
Bank is the California case that sets it out; is that
correct?
MR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: So that's California law.
And what they say in Discover Bank is -- they are
talking about class waivers in both arbitration
contracts and not arbitration contracts. And they say
they are void when it's a consumer contract of adhesion,
when they predictably involve small amounts of damages,
when it is claimed that the party with the superior
bargaining power has carried out a scheme deliberately
to cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually
small sums of money, and the waiver becomes in practice
the exemption of the party from responsibility for its
own fraud.
Now, seems to -- those seem to be the
principles that apply. Those principles apply to
litigation. They apply to arbitration. What's the
problem? They don't say anything there about the things
you mention. They just mention four things, which I
just read.
MR. PINCUS: Well, and the only -- as I
said, there are two questions in this case and I think
it's helpful to keep them separate. One is: Is it
permissible, simply because the rule applies to both
litigation and arbitration, is that sufficient to
satisfy --
JUSTICE BREYER: No. I would guess it's
like Switzerland having a law saying, we only buy milk
from cows who are in pastures higher than 9,000 feet.
That discriminates against milk from the rest of the
continent. But to say we want cows that have passed the
tuberculin test doesn't. So I guess we have to look at
the particular case.
And here, my impression is -- correct me if
I am wrong -- the class arbitration exists. It's not
a -- it's not like having a jury trial. You could have
it in arbitration. You can have it in litigation. So
where is the 9,000-foot cow, or whatever it is? Where
is the discrimination?
MR. PINCUS: Well, I think this is exactly
the 9,000-foot meadow, Your Honor, because I think the
problem here is there is -- it is not possible, based on
the language of section 2 or any other basis that we can
think of, to say a statute that requires the full use of
discovery procedures in court and in arbitration or
factual determinations by a panel of six individuals
selected at random --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, are they
necessarily saying that? As I read it, the plaintiff
brought a case to court, not to arbitration, and then
there was a motion to stay the State court litigation.
Why isn't it a proper reading of this case
to say: You want -- if you are in the arbitration
forum, it's bilateral, but you can't dupe these
plaintiffs out of a class action? So if you don't have
a class action in arbitration, you can have it in court.
That is, the class action is preserved, not necessarily
in the arbitration forum, but in the court.
MR. PINCUS: Well, I think the problem,
Justice Ginsberg, is both prongs of that requirement are
independently problematic. I think, for the reasons
that I was just saying and I think for the reasons that
the Court explained in Stolt-Nielsen, requiring class
arbitration is just the same as requiring discovery or a
jury trial or all of the other judicial processes in
arbitration. And if the alternative prong of that is to
say, well, if you don't do that you must exclude these
claims from arbitration --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they're not
requiring --
MR. PINCUS: -- is independently --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they're not
requiring arbitration --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead, Justice
Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They are not saying you
have to arbitration -- class actions in all arbitration
proceedings. They are identifying a class of cases in
which they pursue the State, who's their own sovereign,
and the savings clause in the FAA permits them in law or
equity to set forth rules to say in this subset of cases
there is a substantive right being affected. That is
different than rules that are looking at procedures and
setting uniform procedures in both.
How do we draw the line between a law that
says discovery has to happen in arbitration, and one
that says a -- in a contract of adhesion, if the
superior party retains the right to do discovery but
tells the inferior party, you can't? And a State says,
that's unconscionable.
MR. PINCUS: Your Honor, I think that's the
precise difference between the two issues that are --
that are in this case. For the reason we have been
discussing, we think there is a very strong argument
that a rule cannot qualify to be saved under section 2
simply because it applies even-handedly to arbitration
and litigation because of the fact that that would sweep
in all of these other rules that we are talking about.
And an additional reason, to respond to
Justice Breyer's question, is that at the time that the
FAA was enacted the ouster doctrine did apply to
arbitration litigation. It was a broad doctrine in
which courts said: We are going to invalidate any
contractual provision that deprives us of jurisdiction
whether it directs the claim to arbitration or it
directs the claim to some other court.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Pincus --
MR. PINCUS: And so the very same argument
being made here could have been made then.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Pincus, I'm not
understanding what test you are asking us to formulate.
Justice Scalia started this by saying, how about a
provision prohibiting certain kinds of attorney's fees?
How about a provision prohibiting certain kinds of -- a
law prohibiting certain kinds of discovery provisions?
And you said that would be fine, for the State courts to
hold those things unconscionable, but it's not fine for
the State court to hold a class arbitration prohibition
unconscionable.
So what separates the two? How do we know
when something is on one side of the line and something
is on the other? Both procedures, but you say some are
fine, to say that those procedures are unconscionable,
but other procedures if you held them unconscionable
that would not be sufficient.
MR. PINCUS: What separates the two is, is
the State in the particular case in which the
determination is made applying principles that apply to
-- across -- that apply to its unconscionability
doctrine across the board.
JUSTICE KAGAN: The State says yes.
MR. PINCUS: Well, but I think --
JUSTICE KAGAN: The State says it absolutely
is. Now, who are we to say that the State is wrong
about that.
MR. PINCUS: Well, let me answer that in two
ways, Justice Kagan. First of all, let me explain why
the hypotheticals that you posit and that Justice Scalia
posited and that Justice Sotomayor posited have been
addressed under the traditional unconscionability
doctrine that we described. In all of those cases, what
courts have said is this provision -- we are measuring
whether it is unconscionable at the time of contracting;
we are looking at the effect on the party before the
court; can this person get to arbitration, is the fee
too high, is it too far away. What about -- we are
looking at the effect on this particular person and we
are deciding whether it shocks the conscience or
whatever their across-the-board State standard is.
And in all of those cases, that's what those
courts do, and that's why those provisions have been
invalidated, because they are invalidated under an even-
handed application of the unconscionability provisions
that courts apply when they assess --
JUSTICE ALITO: I thought that -- I don't
want to interrupt your complete answer.
MR. PINCUS: Sure.
JUSTICE ALITO: But I thought that was the
gist of your argument, the heart of your argument, that
traditional unconscionability in California and
elsewhere focuses on unfairness to the party who is
before the tribunal. So here it would be unfairness to
the Concepcions, rather than unfairness to other members
of the class who are not before the court.
MR. PINCUS: That's exactly right,
Justice Alito.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Pincus, the State
says, well, our unconscionability doctrine may not have
done that in the past, but now in the year 2010 it
actually applies to more things than it did in the past,
and we do take into account third parties and that's our
new unconscionability doctrine. Now, it may be a good
unconscionability doctrine or it may be a bad
unconscionability doctrine, but it's the State's
unconscionability doctrine.
MR. PINCUS: But it is not the State's
general unconscionability doctrine, Justice Kagan. It
is a doctrine that applies only in the context of class
waivers and that's the problem. If the State were to
adopt a general statute that said, for unconscionability
purposes henceforward we will look in assessing the
unconscionability of every provision at third parties,
at the impact on third parties and whether it's fair to
them, perhaps they could do that.
I think there might be some reasons why a
State wouldn't do that, because that would upset a lot
of things in the judicial system that we think of as
routine, such as confidential settlements and the fact
that arbitration doesn't require publication or estoppel
and all kinds of rules could be invalidated on that
ground. But at least it would be an even-handed rule
that the State applied across the board, and it would
also apply to things like the level of rent in rent
contracts and statutes of limitations and all sorts of
things.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why, why, why?
MR. PINCUS: But here, that's not -- I'm
sorry.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why? That's I think what
Justice Kagan is getting at. If a State wants to have a
doctrine which says, you have to have a seal of a
certain kind on certain kinds of contracts, they've
never done it before, but now they do it, and on that
kind you have to have a seal both on the arbitration
contract and on the other. And here what they've done
is they have listed the four characteristics from
Discover Bank, and they've said all contracts to do with
litigation have to satisfy those four.
At which point I think Justice Kagan said,
so what if they've never done this before? They sure
have done it now. And what's the basis for saying that
the Arbitration Act or any other part of Federal law
forbids California from doing that?
MR. PINCUS: Two answers to that,
Justice Breyer. First of all, they haven't done it
generally with respect to contracts. They have made up
a special rule that is targeted on a special kind of
contract and that carries -- to the extent one is
worried about discrimination -- nonfacial discrimination
designing the category of contracts relating to
litigation or dispute resolution is precisely the kind
of category that most presents the risk of
discrimination that isn't facial.
And again, whatever any contract means, we
think it has to mean that the category of dispute
resolution contracts can't be one that satisfies any
contract, because at the time the law was enacted the
ouster doctrine did just that and it was the doctrine
that was being targeted.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that
all State -- most State statutes pertaining to contracts
pertain to a class that is not entirely universal.
Suppose the State had a statute referring to banks,
contracts with banks. That doesn't apply to all
contracts. It doesn't apply to railroads. But we know
that it applies to a class that generally includes both
arbitration and non-arbitration. And that's this case,
because there can be class action rule with respect to
litigation and class action rules with respect to
arbitration. So you have to have some rule that
recognizes that you don't have to have the entire
universe of contracts.
MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I'm not quite sure
what your test is. You have a few of them in your
brief.
MR. PINCUS: Well, I think the "any
contract" language of the statute shows that Congress
was not enacting -- was not providing that everything
other than facial discrimination qualifies for the
savings clause, because it could have said any
nondiscriminatory rule. It said a rule that applies to
any contract. And the reason for that we think is
because of the ouster doctrine it was confronted with,
which did apply to both arbitration and litigation
contracts, and because of the risk generally that a
contract rule could be devised that maybe didn't
facially discriminate against arbitration, but had the
effect of targeting arbitration disproportionately and
that's what is going on.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So how do you have special
rules applicable to banks?
MR. PINCUS: Well, most -- most --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Contracts by banks, can't a
State say, you know, certain bank contracts have to have
this or that?
MR. PINCUS: In most of the examples that we
have looked at of situations like that, the contract
principles that are being applied are general
principles, and perhaps they are being applied -- they
are being specified for four particular categories of
contracts, like the UCC, but they are tied to general
principles.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They claim that here. They
claim it's the general principle of unconscionability.
MR. PINCUS: But -- but I think, as I have
discussed, the problem here it has the label
"unconscionability" on it, but the test that is applied
has nothing to do with the test that is applied in every
other context. So it's an easy case to decide. Going
back to my statutory example, this is an
unconscionability -- this is a test that may have the
label on it, but everything that the court looks at to
find unconscionability or to find this impermissible are
things that are not looked at in the other context. And
in the other context, indeed as the district court said,
this contract is more than fair under our general
unconscionability standard, because it -- the people
before the court are better off than they would be in a
class action.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So then we have -- we
have to serve as reviewers of State law?
MR. PINCUS: I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have to look at what
the States are doing in -- to interpret their own laws?
MR. PINCUS: I think what the Court has to
do, as it does in the independent and adequate State
ground context and other contexts, is to determine
whether the State is -- is applying a rule that is --
that discriminates, because the core protection of
section 2 is discrimination. And so, if the -- if the
State has devised a rule that clearly discriminates, but
has simply put the label on -- of unconscionability,
surely the FAA permits the Court to look at that.
Otherwise it's -- the protection will be reduced to
nothing.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if we look at the
California law and we find other instances of
unconscionability that are applying a standard less
stringent than "shock the conscience," then we would say
okay?
MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor. I think that
the critical question here -- are there other cases that
look to the effect on the party before the court? We
found none and -- and Respondents have found none. Are
there other case that assess the -- whether it's
unconscionability at the time of the dispute rather than
at the time of contracting? There are none. The
statute specifically requires it to be done at the time
of contracting. And are there cases that say, we are
going to look at whether something is -- not whether
something is so unfair as to shock the conscience, but
at whether it is the equivalent to some statutory
procedure? There are none. And that's the problem.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then, Mr. Pincus --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.
MR. PINCUS: I'd like to reserve the balance
of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Pincus.
MR. PINCUS: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gupta.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GUPTA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
As I think several of the questions this
morning have brought out, the question here is not what
this Court would decide if it were sitting as the
Supreme Court of California and applying the State's
common law in the first instance. Rather, the question
is whether the State law at issue falls within a
statutory savings clause that expressly preserves
contract defenses available at law or in equity.
The State law at issue here is not
preemptive, for three reasons. First, it is consistent
with the equal footing principle or nondiscrimination
principle that this Court has consistently recognized is
embodied in section 2.
Second, it's consistent with two key
purposes that the savings clause fulfills under the FAA:
ensuring that arbitration is a matter of consent and not
coercion; and that it represents merely a choice of
forum, but not an exemption from the law.
And third, the State law at issue is a
correct and legitimate application of the State's common
law to which this Court should defer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I could just go
to your -- your second reason seemed to be focused
particularly on arbitration as opposed to a principle
that applies to every other contract.
MR. GUPTA: Well, let me be clear about what
I mean by the second reason. I think that the savings
clause in the FAA serves two critical purposes, and that
is that the -- the contract law doctrines ensure
consent. You don't have arbitration unless you have a
consensual agreement between both parties, and you look
to State contract law to determine whether there is
consent.
And also, I think as this Court has
repeatedly said about arbitration under the FAA, it
represents a choice of forum, but it doesn't withdraw
the parties from the substantive liability rules of the
State.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but the
substantive State liability rule on the issue you are
addressing is that you consider the issue of consent ex
ante, and with respect to arbitration you are
considering it at the time the dispute arose. Isn't
that a discrimination against arbitration agreements?
MR. GUPTA: Well, first of all, I think it
is a -- it's a question of State law whether the
determination is ex ante or ex post. But we actually --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure. That's
true in all of these cases.
MR. GUPTA: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a question of
what the State law provides; then you consider whether
it's consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.
MR. GUPTA: Right. And the Discover Bank
application of State unconscionability law we believe is
an ex ante analysis. It looks at whether the contract
is fair or exculpatory at the time that the contract is
made; and indeed there is -- the two arguments that Mr.
Pincus made about California unconscionability law are
somewhat at war with themselves. He said that the --
the doctrine looks to third parties and that that's
illegitimate; and he said that the doctrine is ex post
and that's illegitimate. But in fact, from the
perspective of a consumer that's entering into this
contract, from the perspective of any AT&T consumer,
they don't know whether they are going to be among the
very few consumers who detect fraud, recognize a legal
claim, or hire a lawyer to do so, and come forward and
seek compensation. And so the Concepcions are situated
just like any other AT&T customer, and that is the point
at which fairness is assessed.
So from the perspective of California
unconscionability doctrine, the Concepcions and -- and
all the other AT&T customers are not differently
situated. It's not a question of whether the
Concepcions, once they have chosen to make a claim,
whether the contract is then fair to them; it's whether
it's fair to any AT&T customer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what other
area of contract law does the court consider
unconscionability not with respect to the parties before
the court, but with respect to third parties?
MR. GUPTA: Well, I think, first of all, the
California State law is applying an exculpatory clause
prohibition that has been on the books since 1872 in
California. And if you look at the cases, many of which
we've cited in our brief today --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But isn't that --
doesn't that look to the parties before the court rather
than third parties?
MR. GUPTA: No. In fact, the -- the
California courts have developed a test that says, we'll
-- we'll enforce exculpatory clauses, or what would
otherwise be exculpatory clauses, if they don't have
significant public effects.
So the test under that statute is actually
to look to the public effects, the effects of similarly
situated people that are parties to the contract. And
for example, there was a case in the early 20th century
under that statute where the question was whether a
banking contract was unfair; and what the court said is
that -- that parties to the contract are not the only
people that matter here; what matters is the interests
of the banking public.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's a general
rule of contract law that contracts contrary to public
policy could be unenforceable. It seems to me that's
quite different than saying we're worried about third
parties that are in the same position as these
particular parties. In other words, it's not simply
adverse public consequences, but it's a different mode
of analysis than I'm familiar with under basic contract
law.
MR. GUPTA: Well, again, I want to try to
explain why I don't think that the Concepcions are --
are any different from the -- what Mr. Pincus is
describing as third parties. At the time that they
entered into the contract, the question is whether the
contract ex ante is unconscionable as to them. And
they're just like anyone else. They don't know whether
they will detect this fraud and be able to come forward.
And so the question is -- is that -- is that
unconscionable as to them? It's not looking only to the
effects on third parties.
But there is also an exculpatory clause
prohibition that has always taken into account the
effects on the public. And both of those are at work in
Discover Bank.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe you can explain
it this way. Compare what the Concepcions have
available to them under the contract with what going
through the arbitration, all the procedures leading up
to arbitration and arbitration, against what they would
get at best if this were allowed to proceed on a class
basis.
MR. GUPTA: Right. The California --
JUSTICE ALITO: Why is -- why are they
better off with a -- with a class adjudication?
MR. GUPTA: Because from an ex ante
perspective, again when they enter into the contract,
they have -- there -- it's not reasonable to be -- to
expect that they will be among the very few people who
will recognize that there's fraud, recognize a legal
claim, and come forward. And so from that perspective,
it -- it is not reasonable them -- for them to give up
the benefits that they would get from a class action.
A class action incentivizes lawyers and
others to detect for this fraud. It makes it -- it
makes it economically justifiable to come forward with
these kinds of claims.
JUSTICE ALITO: And -- and isn't that what
distinguishes this from the ordinary unconscionability
analysis?
If the district court correctly understood
the way the AT&T Mobility scheme works and --and the
district court said that under the revised arbitration
provision nearly all consumers who purchase the
informal -- who pursue, I'm sorry, the informal claims
process, are very likely to be compensated promptly and
in full, etcetera, etcetera. If the district court
understood that correctly, the scheme here was -- is
found to be unconscionable because it doesn't allow the
enlistment of basically private attorneys general to
enforce -- to enforce the law. And isn't that quite
different from ordinary unconscionability analysis?
MR. GUPTA: I don't think it is. I mean,
obviously it's impossible to come up with a precise
analogy that is going to be on all fours. But in our
case we cite -- in our brief we cite cases involving
unreasonably shortened statutes of limitations, where
the California courts for over 100 years have found that
those can be deemed unconscionable. And the principle
is the same. Those kinds of clauses can interfere with
the parties' ability to have notice that they have a
claim and take action on that claim. That -- that kind
of procedural limitation has always been deemed
unconscionable.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that this doesn't
have what's called a blowout clause. Suppose that that
kind of clause was not in there. And the consumer opts
out of the arbitration. Arbitration doesn't -- doesn't
go well. Anyway, can the consumer then insist on the
arbitration that the consumer bargained for, the
individual arbitration that the consumer bargained for?
MR. GUPTA: Well, under this clause the
consumer will always have the ability to proceed on a
bilateral -- on a bilateral basis.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So then the bank has to
have -- liability exposure for two different
proceedings?
MR. GUPTA: I mean that's true anyway,
right? The the mine run of consumer waivers --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you are saying then
California can say it's unconscionable to allow the
parties to agree that there will be just the single
arbitration proceedings? I don't see how the third
parties are necessarily protected. If you say that the
consumer still has the election, that certainly isn't
what they bargained for. Maybe I'm -- maybe that's just
a quarrel with the content of the unconscionability
standard.
MR. GUPTA: Right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Rather than FAA, but I
think it does bear on at least section 4 of the FAA.
MR. GUPTA: Well, and maybe I'm
misunderstanding your question, but I think, you know,
that's true of any of the procedural limitations that
the Petitioners concede would be subject to the
unconscionability doctrine. A person would still be
free to proceed under a basis that would otherwise be
unconscionable.
For example, if you had an arbitration
clause that limited important remedies -- it banned
punitive damages, injunctive relief, insisted on a
distant forum, required excessive fees -- those would be
--
unconscionable as a matter of state contract law, or
could be anyway, but the consumer would still have the
ability to proceed on that basis.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I've asked your
adversary this question and I'm not sure yet what his
answer is, so I'm asking you it. How would you propose
to distinguish between facially neutral contract law
defenses that implicitly discriminate against
arbitration and those that do not? What's the test you
would use to tell the difference between the two?
Because obviously there are subterfuges that some legal
systems could use to address themselves just to
arbitration. So how do we tell the difference?
MR. GUPTA: Right, and we don't deny that's
true. But it's not that different from the way this
Court approaches State law in general. You start from a
position of deference. The Court says this is facially
nondiscriminatory law, it's generally applicable, but
there's a limit on that. If the State law is -- if the
State is engaging in obvious subterfuge to deny
federally protected rights, this Court has always said
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we test that?
MR. GUPTA: -- that there is a limit --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, other than -- I
--
don't want to look through legislative history and
determine whether some committee person said something
that sounds like subterfuge. How do I look at the law
and its effects and determine that subterfuge or that
discrimination?
MR. GUPTA: I think in the first instance it
would be an objective determination. You would see
whether the State court is telling the truth. Is this
law really being applied in the same way in the
arbitration context and outside of the arbitration
context. And here we know because, as Justice Kagan
said, the first California appellate case on point is a
case outside of the arbitration context, the America
Online case. The Discover Bank case relied on that case
when it struck down a class-action ban in the
arbitration context.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where do you get --
JUSTICE BREYER: Your brother says that the
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where do you get
"obvious subterfuge" in the Federal Arbitration Act?
MR. GUPTA: That's not in the Federal
Arbitration Act, Your Honor, but in Mullaney v. Wilbur
case and other cases where the Court is describing the
limits on deference to State law, those are the kinds of
standards the Court has used. If it's not a credible
rule of State law, if the State is not really doing what
its saying, and the result is the deprivation of
Federally protected rights, this Court has always said
that there's a limit on deference to State law. Now --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's in the
independent and adequate State ground context, which
strikes me as quite different. We have a statute here
that says the arbitration agreements have to be treated
like any other contract, any contract. I don't see how
that's the same as obvious subterfuge.
MR. GUPTA: Well, I'm addressing -- Justice
Sotomayor's question, if I understand it, is when you
have a facially nondiscriminatory rule of contract law,
where when you look at the face of the opinion nothing
suggests it's nondiscriminatory. And the question is
how do you tell whether the State court is not telling
the truth? And I think in that circumstance you'd have
to -- I can't think of any other way you would do the
analysis.
JUSTICE BREYER: You have to -- you would do
it differently, because they might be telling the truth.
The example that your brother lawyer gave is this: That
we have a State and the State says, if you have a
contract, in the dispute resolution provision, whether
you have arbitration or not, that provision is void if
it says you won't have a judge, and it's void if it says
you won't have a jury, and it's void if it says that you
will not go to the United States courthouse for deciding
all Federal claims.
That applies whether there is an arbitration
clause or not an arbitration clause. Now, that would
seem to me no subterfuge. It is absolutely clear. They
are not lying. It just happens to prevent arbitration.
And he says that's absolutely true of this one, that
once you get into class actions you will discover you
have something that really looks like a court case. You
have to have discovery, you have dozens of lawyers
involved, you have depositions, you are running off
every 5 minutes to the judge or to somebody to say is
this deposition good, bad or indifferent. You have
methods for enforcing the deposition. You have all
kinds of things.
He can make a much bigger list than me. So
he says: This case is like the case of California
saying everybody can decide it any way they want as long
as they do it before a Federal judge. Okay? Now what's
your answer to that?
MR. GUPTA: Obviously we concede that those
kinds of rules are preempted.
JUSTICE BREYER: But what's your answer to
his specific effort to assimilate the issue in this
case, which is the class action, to the made-up issue,
which you concede is a discrimination?
MR. GUPTA: Right. I think there are two
limiting principles in addition to the discrimination
inquiry. Discrimination doesn't get you there. You can
then ask, is the rule tantamount to a rule of
non-enforceability of arbitration agreements. So for
example, if a State law says you cannot waive the right
to a public jury trial. Now, obviously that renders all
arbitration agreements unenforceable. It contradicts
the general rule of enforceability. To read the savings
clause to allow a rule like that would be to read --
JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about a
rule that says what you have to have in any contract is
a rule that all the rules of the Federal Civil Procedure
apply to discovery, not necessarily in a courtroom, but
you have to follow exactly those procedures?
MR. GUPTA: I think that would bring into
play the second limiting principle, because parties
could contract, obviously, to agree to certain
procedural rules like that. But I think that that would
bring into play a principle of obstacle preemption.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why isn't this
obstacle preemption?
MR. GUPTA: Right. I think one of the
purposes -- we agree with Petitioners about this. One
of the purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act is to
allow parties to contract their procedures, to tailor
their procedures; and in general the courts ought not to
be interfering with those kinds of consensual decisions.
But there are two other important purposes
at play, and no statute pursues its purposes at all
costs. One of those purposes is to ensure that there's
not coercion, that you have a consensual agreement; and
another, just as important, is to ensure that
arbitration merely represents a change of forum, but
isn't an exemption from the law. So that's -- I think
that's at work in the examples that Petitioner concedes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gupta, is -- I'd like
you to focus on Stolt-Nielsen. In Stolt-Nielsen this
Court said that, absent express consent, no class
arbitration. If the seller or employer, whoever it is,
doesn't want that class arbitration, doesn't have to
have it.
And here that's surely the case; the ATT has
not consented to class arbitration. Then California law
says: Well, that's okay; then you will be subject to a
class-action suit in court. But the very purpose of the
arbitration agreement was that you would be in
arbitration and not in court. So why isn't
Stolt-Nielsen dispositive of this case?
MR. GUPTA: I think Stolt-Nielsen is
properly read as -- the questions there was a question
of contract interpretation. The question here is
whether the agreement is valid in the first place,
whether you have a contract. What Stolt-Nielsen tells
you is that you cannot impose class arbitration on an
unwilling defendant.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But here you have an
unwilling defendant who doesn't want class arbitration.
MR. GUPTA: Well, the defendant here has
specified in its arbitration agreement that if the
class-action ban is invalidated, it would prefer to face
any class-wide proceedings in court, and that choice is
up to the defendant. If the defendant chose to face
class-wide proceedings in arbitration, they could do so
under -- under the California rule, or they could elect
to do so in court, and they could do so under whatever
procedures they specified in the agreement or that were
specified in a subsequent agreement between the parties.
California law doesn't impose any particular
procedures on the party. It just insists that in
circumstances where the ban would function as an
exculpatory clause, that there is some avenue for
class-wide proceedings, where claims wouldn't feasibly
be litigated individually. I don't --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Gupta, AT&T says that
nobody would ever choose class arbitration; it's the
worst of both worlds. You get all the procedures, you
get broad liability, but at the same time you have no
judicial review, so that this will effectively kill off
arbitration in the consumer context.
MR. GUPTA: I think one answer to that is
that some parties have chosen class arbitration, and we
cite some examples in the brief. There have also been
hundreds of class arbitrations conducted by the American
Arbitration Association, the leading arbitration
association. Class arbitration has existed for a
quarter century, so it's not something that is foreign
to arbitration.
But also, I just refer back to what I said
to Justice Ginsburg, which is that this is a matter of
consent. Nobody is forcing defendants to face class
arbitration, and nobody is forcing them to face it on
terms that they haven't consented to. So if there are
concerns about -- about the ability of class arbitration
to effectively manage the process, they can be tailored
by the parties. And in fact, there are even hybrid
procedures where --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course. The question is
not whether they are being forced to accept class
arbitration; it's whether they are being coerced into
abandoning regular arbitration. That's really the
issue.
MR. GUPTA: I mean, one could say the same
thing about many of the procedural limitations that both
parties agree are subject to the unconscionability
doctrine. If a defendant said: Well, we don't want to
face arbitration unless we can ban punitive damages or
other important remedies, unless we can insist on
certain kinds of discovery limitations that the State
courts deem unconscionable because they don't allow the
parties to vindicate their rights individually, the same
argument would hold true. The defendant would be able
to say: Well, that's -- you know, if we can't have
arbitration on our terms, we won't have arbitration at
all.
That is not what the Federal Arbitration Act
says, though. The Federal Arbitration Act puts
arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other
contracts. It forbids States from discriminating
against arbitration, but it doesn't require them to
remove all impediments that -- that a party may wish
removed to have arbitration on their terms, even where
it would effectively exculpate --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true, as long as
those impediments are removed on an -- on an equal
footing with all contracts.
MR. GUPTA: That's right. That's right,
Your Honor, and I think -- you know, we concede that if
the California courts were discriminating against
arbitration agreements, if they were applying one rule
to class-action bans or other kinds of procedural
limitations in arbitration and another outside of
arbitration, that would not fall within the savings
clause.
JUSTICE ALITO: Can I take you back to a
question that was asked a few minutes ago, because I'm
not sure I understood your answer.
What is the difference between a State rule
that says that the rules of civil procedure must be
followed in any adjudication and a rule that says that
class adjudication must always be available?
MR. GUPTA: I think in the first instance, I
don't think that -- I'm assuming that you're describing
a rule that purports to apply general contract law,
let's say unconscionability; right?
JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, uh-huh.
MR. GUPTA: I don't think -- I think it
would be hard for a State to credibly claim that the
absence of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
systematically exculpate one party from -- from
liability. That just --
JUSTICE ALITO: No, I just -- I'm not
putting this under an unconscionability label. These
are just general rules, and the question is whether
they -- whether they can be applied, whether they
constitute discrimination against -- against
arbitration.
MR. GUPTA: Well, whether or not they
constitute discrimination against arbitration, I think
your first hypothetical would be preempted, because a
State could not credibly be serving the purposes that
the savings clause serves in insisting on the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure.
JUSTICE ALITO: Why?
MR. GUPTA: Because -- because I don't think
that a credible argument can be made that that
systematically serves and functions as an exculpatory
clause.
There are going to be questions of degree
here, but take, for example, discovery. I think that
both parties would agree that if an employer said: I
get discovery and you, the employee, don't get discovery
for your fact-bound discrimination --
JUSTICE ALITO: No, but I really would
appreciate it if you would answer my hypothetical on one
that was posed before.
What is the difference -- let me change it
slightly -- between a rule that says you must follow the
rules of evidence in every adjudication and a rule that
says that class adjudication must always be available?
I think your answer comes down to the
proposition that the former is inconsistent with the
idea of arbitration, and therefore, that's why it's not
allowed, and the latter is not inconsistent with the
idea of arbitration, and therefore, it is allowed. Is
that correct or not?
MR. GUPTA: No, I think -- I think -- I
think a better way to analyze that is under the rubric
of obstacle preemption, because there are important
purposes that are served by the savings clause in
invalidating certain procedural procedures that have an
exculpatory effect, a substantively unfair effect, but
at the same time the act, to be able to function, has to
allow parties to contract for --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, okay. It amounts to
the same thing. Insisting on compliance with the
Federal -- with the California rules of evidence is an
obstacle to arbitration, but allowing -- insisting on
the availability of class adjudication is not an
obstacle to arbitration. But in the end --
MR. GUPTA: Right.
JUSTICE ALITO: -- we have to make a value
judgment about whether these things, one thing or the
other, fits with arbitration. That's what it comes down
MR. GUPTA: No, I think -- I think that's
not right. I mean, I think in the first instance you
defer to what the State court says it is doing, and what
the State says it is doing -- and there is no reason to
doubt this -- is that it is preventing a procedural
limitation that systematically favors one party, tilts
the playing field to a degree that parties cannot
feasibly vindicate their claims through arbitration.
JUSTICE ALITO: And when it -- when it
imposes the rule that the -- the rules of evidence apply
across the board, it says it feels that these are
necessary in order for parties to be treated fairly in
every method of adjudication.
MR. GUPTA: Right. And, I mean, obviously,
the application of the Federal Rules of Evidence don't
have a systematic effect that favors one party or the
other, and -- and so I think a rule like that would not
be credible. And I'm trying to answer your
hypothetical, but I do think that the discovery --
JUSTICE BREYER: Where do we look to find
the answer? I mean, I understand your answer and I know
the other side's going to say: Well, this is a
tremendous obstacle. If I have one person to deal with,
I say: You want your $75, I will offer you $75, and if
you don't take it and I turn out to be wrong, I'm going
to give you $7,500. That's their system. Right?
So they say the alternative is class action.
There are a million customers. I'm faced with a claim
for $75 million. I can't afford that. I'll settle it,
even if I'm right. So if you have your rule, I'm going
to be facing these things all the time. I'm not -- I'm
not going to enter into arbitration agreements. I will
take my chances in court. Okay? Now, that -- that's
their argument.
So it is empirical, in part: What do I look
to? It's not logic. It's a question of where should
I -- what should I read to show, in your opinion, you're
right?
MR. GUPTA: I think you have to look first
at what the State law is trying to do, and the -- the
hypotheticals about the insistence on jury trials,
insistence on Federal Rules of Evidence or civil
procedure, those are clear -- it just would not be
credible for a State, I think, to say that those things
are required.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Is your test a purpose test
or an effects test? Is it a test that says the State is
doing this in order to kill arbitration, or is it a test
that says the State is doing something that will kill
arbitration?
MR. GUPTA: I think you can look to both.
think you would have to look to both. I mean, it would
pose an obstacle to the statute, whether the State was
doing something antithetical to the purposes of the
statute or whether it had the effect of destroying
arbitration. In either case, those things would be
preempted.
But all of these hypotheticals describe
rules that don't exist under any State's laws and are
unlikely to exist, because they -- they can't -- they
wouldn't really be able to be reconciled with
traditional notions of contract law, and then you really
would have obvious subterfuge. You really would have a
rule that is not true State law.
But -- but I think if you look, for example,
at discovery, a State could not insist on plenary
discovery, full discovery, to the same degree available
in courts, but a State can certainly insist on
invalidating one-sided discovery limitations. A State
could certainly say to someone who seeks to vindicate a
fact-bound employment discrimination claim has to have
some opportunity to develop the facts. Otherwise,
that -- that is exculpatory.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you stick with the
theory that the test is whether or not the law in
question is inconsistent with the idea of arbitration --
whose idea of arbitration? What about, suppose it's the
bank's idea of arbitration, that we -- we want this
settlement, say; we do not want that; that's the bank's
idea of arbitration that the parties agreed on.
MR. GUPTA: Right. I think you are right
Justice Kennedy, and I think the difficulty of
ascertaining what is sort of at the essential core of
arbitration means that the -- that the test of what's
tantamount to a rule of non-enforceability is going to
be -- it's going to be a very small category.
It's going to describe the ouster doctrine,
the jury trial waiver of prohibition; and I think that's
why you have got to resort to some principle of obstacle
preemption to figure out whether the State is -- is
legitimately fulfilling the purposes, the important
purposes that the savings clause serves, or whether it's
just insisting on full-scale procedures for the sake of
it, in ways that have nothing to do with the -- the
State policing its own marketplace, protecting its
substantive rules of liability and ensuring that parties
can adequately vindicate their claims. And if a State
is doing that, I think that kind of rule --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I -- I find it
difficult to regard as -- voiding exculpatory contracts.
I mean, yes, contracts which say I'm not liable if --
even though I've committed a wrong, that's exculpatory.
But the State here says, you have to not only be liable
for any faults that the other party to this contract
discovers, but the other party of this contract has to
be able to benefit from whatever faults anybody else in
the world might find and bring -- and bring a class
action lawsuit. I -- that -- that goes well beyond
forbidding any exculpatory provisions.
MR. GUPTA: Well, with respect,
Justice Scalia, that is not the rule of law that this
State has announced. The State has made a judgment that
if you preclude class-wide relief, that will mean --
that will gut the State's substantive consumer
protection laws, because people will -- in the context
of small frauds not be able to bring those cases.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. GUPTA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Pincus, you have
minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Although we believe we win under the
principle of obstacle preemption that was just being
discussed for the reasons that were enunciated in
Stolt-Nielsen, we think there is a much easier way for
this Court to decide this case. Congress when it wrote
section 2 used the phrase "any contract." And it
clearly did that for a reason, and the reason was it
wasn't -- it recognized, as Justice Sotomayor said, that
there could be attempts through nondiscriminatory
provisions to injure arbitration; and the protection
Congress adopted was a prophylactic rule. It said if
the State law rule that the State is trying to apply to
an arbitration clause applies broadly to a large set of
clauses, that's the best protection against
discrimination and that's why the "any contract"
language is there.
And so, in answer to your question, Justice
Sotomayor, about where to look for, for what "any
contract" means, we think it means very broad; and the
Court has said that, and the doctrines that the court
has identified as qualifying -- duress, fraud and
unconscionability -- are doctrines that apply broadly
across the entire range of contract.
But one thing that is very clear, we think,
is that it can't mean -- "any contract" can't mean any
dispute resolution contract, because that is the
gerrymandered category that most presents the risk of
discrimination. And if the Court holds that that
category is impermissible to justify a rule, it deals
with all of the hypotheticals that are being discussed
because they are all jury waivers, discovery, evidence;
those are all rules that, as the Court has propagated as
hypotheticals, are rules that apply to all dispute
resolution clauses, and they are focused on dispute
resolution clauses.
So we think that disposes of the argument
that Discover Bank can be applied, simply because it
applies to litigation contracts and arbitration
contracts.
The next question is Respondents' second
argument, which is okay, if that is not a reason it
falls within the savings clause, it falls within the
savings clause because it's simply an application of
California's general unconscionability doctrine. And
that is where we turn to the first part of the issues I
was discussing in the issues that -- that I was
discussing in the first part of the argument with the
Court, which is it isn't, because in the three
particulars that I listed, it is clearly a totally
different legal rule that simply has the
unconscionability label on it.
And just to drill down on my colleague's
discussion that this was really an ex ante analysis. It
couldn't be an ex ante analysis, because that would have
to take into account that the vast majority of claims
that anyone will ever have under a contract are
nonclassable claims. And as to nonclassable claims,
it's clear that the arbitration process is infinitely
better than the court process, because for most small
consumer claims there is no real court process. And so
if one were to make an ex ante assessment of the
fairness for the parties of the court, it wouldn't just
be about classable claims; it would have to include
nonclassable claims; and as to those claims it is clear
that there is a tremendous benefit to those people from
the arbitration clause.
With respect to exculpation, my friend
referred to the California rule that the contract has to
have a public effect. That is not about effects on
third parties. In the Tunkl case, which is a California
Supreme Court case that we cite, the court makes clear
that it's looking for contracts that -- in which public
services are being performed and that are otherwise
imbued with a public interest. It's not looking at all
at the effects on third parties.
Finally, my colleague spoke about lots of
class arbitrations. To our knowledge all of those class
arbitrations were arbitrations that were conducted
before this Court's decision in Stolt-Nielsen where a
party had a silent agreement and therefore it was held
by some lower courts to mean that class arbitration was
permissible. We are not aware as we say in our brief of
any contract that explicitly permits class arbitrations
for the reasons that the Court discussed. It's not --
