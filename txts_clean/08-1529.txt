MS. GOLDENBERG: I'm very glad, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And we’ll hear
argument in Case 08-1529, Hui v. Castaneda.
Ms. Goldenberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. GOLDENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
In section 233(a), Congress extended an
absolute immunity to officers and employees of the
Public Health Service. That provision, reflecting
Congress's policy judgment that the immunity was
necessary to revitalize the Public Health Service, makes
a claim against the United States under the Federal Tort
Claims Act the exclusive remedy for injury or death
resulting from the performance of medical or related
functions and precludes any other civil action or
proceeding against the individuals by reason of the same
subject matter.
Without grappling with the language of
section 233(a), Respondents have tried in a number of
different ways to imply a limitation into the test for
constitutional claims, but none of those arguments
creates any ambiguity in the statute, for three reasons.
First, the Bivens exception, found in the
Westfall Act itself, applies only to the immunity set
forth in the Westfall Act and says nothing about the
scope of the entirely separate and distinct immunity set
forth in section 233.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the immunities
set forth in the Westfall Act? I thought that they
were -- they applied to all Federal employees?
MS. GOLDENBERG: Yes, Your Honor, that's
correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Including the Public
Health Service.
MS. GOLDENBERG: Yes, that's correct.
Public Health Service employees can take advantage both
of the immunities set forth in the Westfall Act and also
of the separate, preexisting, more specific immunity that’s
afforded to them by section 233(a).
And this Court's decision in Smith, I think,
made clear that those two immunities can coexist. There’s
no conflict between them. And what this Court said in
Smith is that the Westfall Act immunity adds to the
prior immunity, and employees can take advantage of both
of them.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, our job is to
determine Congress's intent when it passed 233(a). What
we do know is that there was no Bivens immunity at the
time; the FTCA had only a limited application under
certain driver-related accidents. So we really don't
have anything to tell us, because they didn't even know
that there was a constitutional claim that could be
raised, what they would have intended or not intended.
And I thought that Justice Ginsburg's point
would be that the Westfall Act tells us what they
intended, because by its nature it applied to all
employees and didn't differentiate among them, and
copied 233's immunity, so that one can look at it and
say, ah, that speaks of Congress's intent.
MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, certainly it's true
that when Congress enacted the Westfall Act it could
have broadly said, for instance, notwithstanding any
other provision of law, no Federal employee shall assert
a statutory immunity to constitutional claims. But it
didn't do that. It did something much more narrow than
that, which is that what it said was in section
79(b)(2), paragraph (1) -- the immunity for Federal
employees that was just set forth shall not apply to
constitutional claims. And that’s --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any other Act
besides 233(a) that is similar --
MS. GOLDENBERG: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that gives separate
immunity? Which are those?
MS. GOLDENBERG: There are a number of them,
Your Honor. Most of them apply to Federal medical
workers, although not all of them. There is 10 U.S.C.
section 1089, the Gonzalez Act, which is discussed in
our brief and in the government's brief, which applies
to Army doctors. There are statutes applying to NASA
doctors, to Veterans Administration doctors, to certain
medical volunteers.
So there are a number of these statutes
passed over a period of several decades. But in --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that,
quite apart from the Westfall Act, there’s a more --
more basic answer that you would make to Justice
Sotomayor's question. And that is, because the nature
of immunity clauses are to make the employees secure
against unforeseen causes of action as well as foreseen.
I think that's a principled answer you could make.
If I made that answer, do you have authority
I could cite for that proposition?
MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, I think that this
Court has, you know, broadly speaking, in talking about
judicially created immunities -- that immunity is for
hard cases as well as easy cases. And the Van de Kamp
decision that this Court recently issued with respect to
judicial immunity I think says --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.
MS. GOLDENBERG: -- something along those
lines.
But I think it's true, certainly, that --
it's true that Congress, when it passed section 233,
didn't know for sure that there was going to be a Bivens
cause of action that was going to be allowed. But it
spoke very broadly. It said "any other civil action or
proceeding." And when it did that, it surely meant
civil actions or proceedings that were created by the
courts at some later point in time as well as those that
existed at the time.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we limit it, then
Congress would have to reenact a statute every time
there was some new cause of action?
MS. GOLDENBERG: Exactly, Your Honor. And I
think the problem with the interpretation that makes the
interpretation of the statute depend on the timing of
the Bivens decision is pointed up by two different
statutory provisions and the odd results that you would
have.
One is that the Gonzalez Act, which I
referred to earlier -- it’s 10 U.S.C. section 1089 --
was enacted in 1976, it has immunity-conferring language
that’s extremely similar to the immunity-conferring
language of section 233(a). In fact, we know that when
Congress enacted the Gonzalez Act, it looked at and
thought about section 233(a), and yet if it mattered
whether Bivens had yet been decided, the Gonzalez Act
would bar Bivens claims, but 233(a) wouldn't, even though
you can't make that kind of distinction based on their text.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, I don't look to
see what Congress intended. I look to see what the
statute says. I don't know that we -- we -- we
psychoanalyze the text of a statute on the basis of what
the Congress at that time knew. The text says what it
says.
MS. GOLDENBERG: Yes, Your Honor, I agree.
And the text here is very broad and very clear that it's
any other civil action or proceeding that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That’s what it says.
MS. GOLDENBERG: -- that results from the same
subject matter. And I think one thing that's important
is that "subject matter" here clearly means the same set
of facts or the same set of circumstances.
So that, it -- it's not the case that you
only get immunity where your cause of action is somehow
similar to the cause of action you have under the FTCA.
If you -- you get immunity if you have any claim against
the individuals that comes out of the -- the same set of
facts, even if it were true that there was some
requirement of an FTCA remedy, which we don't believe
there is.
And what’s absolutely clear here as well is
that Respondents do have an FTCA remedy against the
United States. They have brought an FTCA claim against
the United States. The United States has admitted
liability on that claim. That’s found at page 328 of
the Joint Appendix. And so the question now is, what
damages will the Respondents recover from the United
States? And -- and in that setting, most certainly the
claim against the individuals is barred by section
3(a).
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you comment on --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's a -- there’s
a ceiling, because the Tort Claims Act refers to the law
of the place where the act or omission occurred. In
this case it's California?
MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, Your Honor,
California law is what's been discussed in the briefs.
I understand that it's possible that Respondents might
argue that some of the acts or omissions here took place
in the District of Columbia, because that's the place
where some of the decisions were made about the
treatment authorization requests. But California law is
what has been asserted so far in the case. That's true.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which would put a lid
on the damages, since this is a death case, of 250,000?
MS. GOLDENBERG: Not exactly, Your Honor.
There is no limit whatsoever on the economic damages in
a case arising out of professional negligence. There is,
under California law, a $250,000 cap on noneconomic
damages. As we have said in our briefs, we think that
in this case, where Respondents have argued intentional
wrongdoing by the United States, for which they can
recover under the FTCA, if they can prove that something
more than negligence was at issue, then it's possible
under California law, although California law is not
entirely clear, that they could actually exceed that
$250,000 cap for noneconomic damages.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you to comment
on the fact that, in the Carlson case, apparently the
assistant surgeon general was, in fact, a defendant, and
the government failed to make this defense?
MS. GOLDENBERG: Your Honor, I'm not certain
why the defense wasn't raised in the case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But if you’re right,
they should have.
MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, not necessarily,
because there may be factual issues that -- that we're
not now aware of. In other words, it may be that the
government concluded that, despite what was alleged in
the complaint, that when that particular individual took
the acts complained of, he wasn't somehow wearing his
PHS hat, he was operating in some other capacity. So --
but that’s obviously just speculation.
And it’s -- it is not clear why that defense
wasn't raised. What is clear is that it was not raised
and, not only that, but in the court of appeals and in
this Court, there is no reference made to the fact that he's
in the Public Health Service.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, that’s kind of
interesting that apparently the government was not
aware of the breadth of the position they’re --
you’re now taking.
MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, I'm not sure that’s
necessarily the conclusion I would draw. As I say,
there may be factual reasons why it wasn't raised.
There may be strategic reasons why it wasn't raised.
It's hard to speculate on that so long after the --
after the fact.
But what is clear from Carlson is that the
way that section 233(a) did arise in that case is that
the Court used it as a specific example to contrast with
the FTCA itself, and said that section 233 was a place
where Congress had made known explicitly its intent that
the FTCA be the exclusive remedy and that other remedies
be precluded.
That's the way that 233(a) was argued in
the briefs in that case, and that's how the Court used
it. And that’s obviously extremely supportive of the
Petitioners’ plea for immunity here.
This Court has already essentially
recognized in Carlson, in reasoning in support of its
holding, that that is the role that 233(a) plays, and the
Court must have been talking about barring Bivens claims
because that's what Carlson was about. So that’s the
significance of 233(a) in that case.
The Respondents also -- on a subject we
haven't touched on yet, I think, look at the title of
section 233(a) and some of its other subsections, and
there I think it's clear that the title can't vary the
clear statutory text in any way. Even if the title were
relevant here, it talks about negligence and
malpractice. And we've cited in our reply brief, at pages
to 19, the authorities showing that when the statute
was enacted in 1970, malpractice was thought to sweep
very broadly to cover any bad acts, any malpractice, and
so it doesn't operate -- the title here can't operate as
a limitation on the scope of this provision.
With respect to the history, the one
other thing that I wanted to point out that I didn't get
to in my answer before is another odd result that you
would have, if you looked at when Bivens was decided and
made that your deciding factor, is that the FTCA's
judgment bar, at 28 U.S.C. section 2676, which was enacted
in 1948, which says that when you take a claim against
the United States under the FTCA all the way to judgment,
you are barred from raising any other civil action or
proceeding by reason of the same subject matter. So
very similar language to what we have here. That
wouldn't bar Bivens claims, even though every court of
appeals to have looked at the issue has said that it
does cover Bivens claims in a different sense.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that would bar a
later Bivens claim. I assume you could bring a Bivens
action first, and the bar provision would not apply,
assuming you can bring the Bivens claim.
MS. GOLDENBERG: Yes, I think that's right.
But the -- all I'm trying to say is that it's the "any
other civil action or --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.
MS. GOLDENBERG: -- proceedings" language in
the judgment bar. If you looked at whether Bivens had
been decided yet, it wouldn't cover Bivens because the
statute was enacted prior to the time that Bivens was
decided. It was enacted in 1948.
So it's not -- it doesn't make sense to make
your statutory interpretation, your interpretation of
those words, hinge on the fact that Bivens had or hadn't
been decided yet.
If there are no further questions, I’d
like to reserve my remaining time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Shah.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
By its plain terms, section 233(a) precludes
any civil action against officers and employees of the
Public Health Service arising out of performance of
their medical duties. Instead, it makes an action
against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims
Act the exclusive remedy for injury arising out of
PHS-provided care. Unlike the Westfall Act, section 233
contains no carve-out for constitutional claims, nor is
there any textual basis for which to imply one.
Accordingly, this Court should reverse the
Ninth Circuit's decision allowing Respondents’ Bivens
claims against the individual Petitioners on top of
their FTCA claims against the United States.
Now, even assuming Congress did not
specifically have Bivens claims in mind at the time that
they enacted this statute, that's no reason to limit the
plain terms of section 233(a). First, Justice Kennedy,
going to your question about whether there's authority
for that proposition that when Congress doesn't
specifically anticipate a certain set of facts yet the
plain terms control, that that is the correct result,
this Court has stated both in the RICO context as well
as in other contexts that the fact that Congress doesn't
specifically contemplate application of the statute to
particular circumstances simply demonstrates the breadth
of the statute and not any ambiguity. Those statements
are set forth on page 15 of our brief, Sedima, Yeskey,
and others.
The second point I would make is the best
indication of Congress's broad intent is simply the
plain terms of the statute. Congress could have enacted
a statute that only provided immunity for, say,
negligent performance of medical duties. It included no
such limitation in 233(a). It could have made the FTCA
remedy exclusive of, say, only common law causes of
action or State law causes of action, or even existing
causes of action. It did not do that. It said it is
the exclusive remedy for any other civil action by
reason of the same subject matter. Congress could --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, is that -- is
that the same -- in all the statutes that Carlson cites
on page 20, when they say that Congress follows the
practice of explicitly stating what it means to make the
FTCA an exclusive remedy, there's this -- the Gonzalez
Act and there’s 233(a), and then there is the swine flu.
Are they all -- are all those
provisions, provisions like 233(a), that say "any civil
action"?
MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor, in terms of that
latter phrasing "exclusive of any other civil action or
proceeding." For example, the Gonzalez Act, which is
reproduced in the gray brief on page 1a of our -- of the
government's appendix, it uses very similar language.
It says: The FTCA remedy shall be exclusive of any
other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same
subject matter. That’s identical language to that used
in 233(a).
Now, there is a way in which 233(a) is even
broader than any of those other statutes in its
description of what type of performance of medical
duties is covered. There, there is no modifier of
negligence or wrongful act or omission. It simply says:
Any performance of medical duties is covered.
In the Gonzalez Act, which we would submit
has as quite broad language and should have the same
effect, they at least have a qualifier of negligent or
wrongful act or omission. Not that that should create a
change in result, but it just goes to show the
incredibly broad language that Congress used to show --
that Congress used in 233(a).
And I think on the Gonzalez Act point -- and
Justice Sotomayor, I think this goes to your question
about whether there are other statutes -- even though
that Congress may not have contemplated Bivens at the
time, the Gonzalez Act was passed in 1976, 5 years after
Bivens had decided, and yet Congress used the identical
language or nearly identical language as present in
3(a) in enacting the Gonzalez Act. Presumably,
Congress was aware of the potential for Bivens liability
at the time, yet they chose to use the same categorical
text.
And in the legislative history of the
Gonzalez Act, they say they used that text for the
specific purpose of ensuring total financial immunity --
immunity from total financial liability for DOD and
armed forces medical personnel.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me how many
PHS personnel work in settings outside custodial
settings?
MR. SHAH: Outside which?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Custodial settings.
MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, there's 6,000
-- approximately 6,000 commissioned officers. Of those,
slightly more than 1,000 of the commissioned PHS
officers work in either the Bureau of Prisons or in ICE
detention facilities.
So the remaining 5,000 of the commissioned
officers may not work in what you would call a strictly
custodial context. A bulk -- the majority of them work
for the Indian Health Service, and that’s true for both
employees and the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. For the
Indian --
MR. SHAH: For the Indian Health Service.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And is there a reason
Congress would want to immunize PHS personnel against
Bivens claims in a custodial setting, but not immunize
Bureau of Prison personnel?
MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I think they
would want to immunize Bureau of Prison personnel. And,
in fact, that's where a majority of these types of
claims come up. That, of course, is another custodial
setting, and -- and I think Congress would have been
aware --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But not every doctor --
if they come under the FTCA, they -- their --
constitutional claims are not immunized against them --
MR. SHAH: Oh, I see.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- unless they are PHS
personnel.
MR. SHAH: Right. Right. You’re right.
If they were -- if they were a BOP employee --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.
MR. SHAH: -- as opposed to PHS personnel,
then you’re right, they would fall under the Westfall
Act, and there would be the carve-out for constitutional
claim.
Now, what we do know is that Congress
enacted this special protection for Public Health
Service personnel and singled them out at the Surgeon
General's request in 1970. And I think it's important
to remember, in 1970 -- this is pre-Westfall Act -- it was
not at all clear that Federal medical personnel were
immune even from common law negligence, for example.
And so even from that point, putting Bivens
liability aside, Congress chose to accord special
protection to PHS personnel above and beyond that
entitled to those who they were working with side by
side, say in the Bureau of Prisons or in detention --
JUSTICE ALITO: Are they paid less than
other -- than other Federal employees who perform
similar functions? And what do -- what do physicians
who are not -- were not employees of the Public Health
Service do about liability for Bivens actions? Are
they responsible for getting their own malpractice
insurance?
MR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, in
terms of the -- in terms of the ordinary claims, the
common law claims, of course, that would be covered by
the Westfall Act. In terms of Bivens, in terms of
insurance against Bivens claims in particular, my
understanding -- and this is anecdotal -- is that most --
most of the medical personnel in the Bureau of Prisons
do not have any other protection beyond that that’s
provided by the Westfall Act. That is, they don't have
separate policies.
There is -- at least according to the
citation in Respondents’ brief about a Web site that
shows that you can get Bivens insurance. It's not clear
to me whether that's available to Federal -- Federal
medical personnel, at least in the amounts of insurance
that might be necessary to adequately protect them --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, we're -- you
know, we’re talking here as though Congress is a
perpetual unchanging institution. Why would it have
done this for Public Health Service employees and not
have done this for Bureau? It wasn't the same Congress
that passed those two Acts. The one may have been a
stingier Congress than the other, or there -- there may
have been more lobbying by one of the other groups in
one case.
I don't see any reason why we have to
philosophically reconcile the -- the granting of -- of
greater immunity to Public Health Service employees.
MR. SHAH: Justice Scalia, I completely
agree. I think it's correct that the important fact is
the fact that Congress accorded them special protection.
Again, this was -- this was at the request, the specific
request of the Surgeon General, and they did this to
help revitalize the Public Health Service.
Now, I don't think that it’s -- that the
Public Health Service -- it’s anomalous that they get
this protection. I think they’re in many ways similarly
situated to medical personnel who have served for DOD in
the armed forces. Like DOD medical personnel, PHS
officers can be assigned to very difficult situations
and settings, sometimes in armed conflict, other custodial
settings, and they can be ordered to perform certain
medical conditions.
In the Gonzalez Act legislative history,
Congress says that that was a reason -- an additional
reason as to why they wanted to accord immunity. And I
think PHS personnel are similarly situated. If this
Court were looking for a reason, the fact is they were
accorded the same immunity, and that’s the dispositive
factor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Just as a matter of
curiosity, do all of these immunity provisions come out
of the same committee? Or can one assume that the
Public Health Service may have come out of one committee
of Congress, the Bureau of Prisons may have come out of
another committee of Congress, the DOD may have come out
of a third committee of Congress?
MR. SHAH: Right. I don't know if they all
came out of the same committee, but these certainly span
a wide spectrum of years, all the way from the 1960s
to -- to the late 1970s, in terms of when these various
immunity provisions were enacted. Some of them happened
at the same time, like, I believe, the provision for NASA
personnel was added at the same time the Gonzalez Act
was passed.
JUSTICE ALITO: If section 2679(b)(2),
instead of saying paragraph (1) does not extend nor
apply, had said the remedy against the United States
provided by sections 1346(b), et cetera, and repeated
that language from (b)(1), and then said: "Is not the
exclusive remedy in any civil action against an employee
of the government," and continued with subsection (2),
then the result here would be different, wouldn't it?
MR. SHAH: Your Honor, it may be a closer
case but I don't think that the result would be
different, and here's why: If you look at the text of
3(a) -- and this is on the very last page of the -- of
the government's brief -- it does refer to the FTCA in
terms of the remedy that a -- that a plaintiff should
seek, but it's not -- it does not look to the FTCA to
make that remedy exclusive.
Instead, it provides independent language,
independent of the FTCA, to make the remedy exclusive.
It says, “The remedy against the United States” under the
FTCA -- that's what it references -- “for damage for
personal injury including death resulting from” medical
performance -- and then it has its own language -- "shall be
exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by
reason of the same subject matter." It does not
reference the FTCA in that latter clause, and it's that
latter clause that makes the remedy exclusive.
So, regardless of the language of the
Westfall Act, I think -- I don't think it would make a
difference to the result if Congress had used the
wording that you suggest, Justice Alito.
The one -- the one final point I’d like
to make is I think it bears emphasizing that this is not
a case where there is no other relief than a Bivens
remedy available. The FTCA remedy is not only available
generally, but the United States has already admitted
liability on Respondents' medical negligence claim in
this case. The only difference from Respondents'
amount -- from Respondents' perspective now is the
amount of damages that are recoverable, and we would
submit --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the -- could the
plaintiff contest the certification that this was within the
scope -- and say it was so egregious, it was outside the
scope, and, therefore, it doesn't come -- come within
3(a) or anything else, and so we have a straight claim
against the defendants?
MR. SHAH: To my knowledge, plaintiffs have
not made that argument in this case, that they were not
acting within the scope.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Or they would lose their
argument against the -- I mean, they would lose their
claim against the government if they were taking that
position?
MR. SHAH: They would lose their FTCA claim
against the government, then, Your Honor.
If there are no further questions. Thank
you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Shah.
Mr. Doyle.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CONAL DOYLE
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. DOYLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Section 233 does not bar Bivens claims here
for two principal reasons. First, 233 does not abrogate
a constitutional cause of action because it cannot
satisfy Carlson's explicit declaration test, which is a
type of clear statement rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, that's quite a surprising
statement for you to make, when the very first statute
that Carlson mentions is 233(a).
MR. DOYLE: Your Honor, I believe you’re
referring to the dicta in Carlson on page 20.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. DOYLE: And it's interesting
to note how that issue was raised. In the briefs, it wasn't
raised arguing that 233(a) bars Bivens claims; the government
didn't make that argument. And, in fact, it was raised in
the Respondents' cert petition or brief in opposition for
the proposition that -- that the language of that
statute actually allowed a Bivens claim because it
didn't preclude it. And in -- in response the
government actually argued that because Bivens hadn't
been decided in -- in 1970, that it could not have
possibly preserved Bivens claims. So it was actually
the opposite issue that was -- that was addressed in
Carlson --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it certainly
doesn't get that out of the way. It's put on page 20,
because one of the reasons why Carlson enables – allows the Bivens Act
is that it doesn't contain language and the -- and it --
it seems to me that this -- that this paragraph is
contrasting statutes with Carlson, because in Carlson
there is no -- there is no other statute.
MR. DOYLE: Justice Ginsburg, if I may
reply, I believe that that's not the proper way to read
that dicta for two reasons. First, I think Justice
Stevens mentioned the Assistant Surgeon General of the
United States was actually a defendant in the case, and
so although this 233(a) immunity wasn't -- wasn’t
decided in Carlson, certainly the Court was aware that a
-- that a Public Health Service defendant was in the
case, and they wouldn't have permitted an action to move
forward against that defendant had they believed that
3 barred Bivens.
And, second, it -- it specially characterizes
the explicit declaration as applying to malpractice, not
Bivens claims. And other -- for example, another
statute in the category there was the Federal Drivers
Act, and certainly it's hard to imagine how a Federal
driver could be liable under -- under Bivens.
And so I think a better reading of that
dicta is that the Court is just saying: Here's an
example; these statutes show that when Congress makes an
explicit declaration, but the issue is explicit as to
what? And it's clear I think from reading that dicta
based on the existence of the Surgeon General in the
case and the fact that the dicta was qualified, that it
didn't apply to Bivens.
But moving back to the Carlson test, 233
can't satisfy the test because Carlson never even -- or
Congress never considered whether the FTCA was a
substitute for Bivens in 1970. And this point is
underscored by the fact that the statute was enacted
before Bivens and that the cause of action at issue here
wasn't recognized until 10 years later in Carlson.
And, second, when Congress did finally
consider for the first time whether the FTCA was an
adequate substitute for Bivens in 1988, it expressly
preserved, rather than barred, Bivens claims in the
Westfall Act.
And the Westfall Act was a comprehensive
statute that was intended to provide an overhaul of
personal immunity at the request of this Court in
Westfall v. Erwin, and it applied to all Federal
employees, including members of the Public Health
Service. And that was the holding of this Court in
Smith.
And Petitioners’ reading here would actually
require this Court to write in an implied exception to
the Westfall Act that doesn't exist, that would exempt
out Public Health Service personnel from the explicit
carve-out of Bivens. Moreover, the Petitioners’ reading
here --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You claim the Westfall Act
implicitly repealed 233(a)? Is that what you say?
MR. DOYLE: No, Your Honor, there’s no
implicit repeal here, although we can --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that provision says
that it's exclusive, and you’re saying the Westfall Act
says it’s not exclusive.
MR. DOYLE: Your Honor, there’s no implicit
repeal here for the -- because 233(a) still has
independent work to do. But we do concede that under
our reading, there would be no -- it wouldn't really do
any more work for Public Health Service employees,
because they have a broader protection under the
Westfall Act, because it applies to any wrongful act or
omission.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But it isn't just made
superfluous. It is repealed. The provision of it that
says "it shall be exclusive" is repealed.
MR. DOYLE: The provision --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Implicitly, because it's
not specifically referred to.
MR. DOYLE: Well, there were no -- there
would be no repeal because there are a number of other
provisions within section 233 itself that it's relevant
to. And so the Public Health Service Act --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's just (a). We’re
just talking about (a).
MR. DOYLE: Yes, but these other provisions
refer back to (a). And if I could --
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand your
Westfall Act argument. I must be missing something. My
understanding is, many years ago, Congress passes a
statute and says: Give absolute immunity from Bivens
actions. Sue the government; don't sue the employee.
It says that, basically. A long time ago.
Then, sometime after, Congress passes
another statute, and in paragraph (a) of that statute,
it says: An even larger group of people, just sue the
government. And then it says: As to this larger group
of people, paragraph (1) of this statute doesn't apply to
Bivens actions.
So, what does that got to do with this
earlier statute? Doesn’t it refer to it. I don’t --
in other words, I understand your Carlson argument.
I got that one, but I don't understand this argument if
I have the statutes right.
MR. DOYLE: Well, Your Honor, I think that
-- and I don't mean to repeat myself, but to answer that
question --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, is there an answer to
the question? Because that would be important.
MR. DOYLE: I believe there is. But I think
that the fundamental issue you have to look at, Your
Honor, is whether, in 1970, Congress intended to abrogate
a constitutional cause of action. And in this Court's
line of clear statements --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's your Carlson
argument. I got that one.
MR. DOYLE: Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that one.
The one I don't understand is what's the relation of the
Westfall Act to this argument?
MR. DOYLE: There’s -- there’s two
relationships between the Westfall Act and the Public
Health Service Act. First, the Westfall Act simply
applies on its face to all government employees. This
Court has held that, and so --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, right. They give the
government employees the same kind of immunity that -- a
little more limited, and that's in paragraph (1). And
then paragraph (2) says: Paragraph (1) doesn't apply to
Bivens actions.
It doesn't say anything about the earlier
statute. It applies to a different group of people. It
has all kinds of requirements, nothing involved with
3. Okay. So, what is it to do with this case?
Now, what I'm thinking now from your
hesitation is it has nothing to do with the case; it's
the Carlson thing that is the important thing. Now, you
tell me why I'm wrong.
MR. DOYLE: Justice Breyer, if I could
answer. This Court, in Smith, held that the immunity
conferred by section (1) applies to all Federal employees.
And you have to read (1) and (2) together. I mean, you can't
divorce them, because section (1) grants immunity, but
subsection (2) affects it and -- and helps define it by
saying that --
JUSTICE BREYER: You’re talking about the
Westfall Act. Absolutely right.
MR. DOYLE: Yes. And that said --
JUSTICE BREYER: I just say, what does the
Act have to do with this older Act?
MR. DOYLE: Well, it isn't -- the older Act
refers to the Federal Tort Claims Act as providing the
exclusive remedy in this case. And the FTCA is the only
remedial scheme in the case. So, in other words, 233
doesn't set forth within it different remedies that
prospective plaintiffs can get against the Public Health
Services. It decided to define it by referring to the
FTCA. And when you go to the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Westfall -- Westfall Act is
not -- is not the FTCA, is it?
MR. DOYLE: It is. Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, it is the -- in other
words, you think -- I thought the FTCA Act is an Act
that gives you action against the government.
MR. DOYLE: The Westfall Act is just simply
an amendment to the FTCA.
JUSTICE BREYER: So it says: This Act is
the exclusive remedy -- the FTCA is an exclusive remedy
for all employees, but this provision which gives us an
exception does not give you the exception, does not make
it exclusive for Bivens actions.
Okay. You go ahead. You explain it to me.
I don't want to keep repeating my skepticism, I want to listen.
(Laughter.)
MR. DOYLE: Okay. Well, the first clause
of section 233(a) states that -- that the remedy against
the United States provided by 1346(b) is remedy
available. And so you go to 1346(b), and Congress
defined the 1346(b) -- I believe it's on page 5a of the --
of our appendix -- and says that -- that the remedy is
subject to the entire provisions of the FTCA. And so you
have to look to the entire provisions of the FTCA
to determine what the remedy is, because --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what says "entire
subject" -- 233(a), where does that say anything other
than -- I mean, it reads like it's immunity from any
civil action. That's -- those are the words I think
that you have to overcome. It says: Plaintiff has a
substitute remedy against the United States under the
Federal Tort Claims Act, and the employee is immune from
any civil action. And then you say, but any civil
action doesn't include Bivens actions. And you must be
saying that the later Act shrinks the former Act.
MR. DOYLE: The later Act amended the former
Act; that's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It amended 233(a) --
MR. DOYLE: It -- it did, in --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- without mentioning it?
MR. DOYLE: -- effect, because it's
incorporated by reference through the Act. So 1346(b),
the first sentence says “subject to the provisions of
chapter 171,” which is the entire FTCA. And within that
chapter, there's a provision entitled "Exclusiveness of
Remedy." And that defines -- and that really addresses
the precise issue before the Court, whether the FTCA is
the exclusive remedy here for a Bivens action. And it
specifically says in that section that Bivens actions
are excluded.
And so if you want to find out what remedy
is available to a prospective plaintiff, you have to
look at how Congress defined the remedy, and it
specifically defined it by limiting it under its
Exclusiveness Clause to common law torts, not Bivens
claims.
But I think one of the key principles here
that we have to acknowledge is that you defer -- the
Court defers to Congress in policy considerations like
this because presumably Congress is in a better position
than the Court to -- to weigh policy decisions like
providing immunity to certain government employees. But
the deference there is only appropriate where Congress
has actually faced the issue and balanced the policy
considerations. And it could not have done so in 1970,
because Bivens hadn't been decided; Estelle v. Gamble
hadn't been decided until 1976, which -- which
established the deliberate indifference standard; and
then Carlson wasn't decided until 1980. And when
Congress, for the first time, actually looked at the
issue --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you say any -- any
other civil action that -- that did not exist prior to
the enactment of 233(a) would not be covered by its
exclusion because Congress couldn't have known that this
civil action existed, so that it only covered those
causes of action that existed at the time the statute
was passed?
MR. DOYLE: Only -- only as to
constitutional causes of action, Justice Scalia.
And I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why? I mean, if your
theory is it doesn't preclude anything they didn't know
about, if they didn't know about something, whether it's
constitutional or not, what -- what reason is there to
say it's precluded?
MR. DOYLE: Well, I think that the issue
here is, is that when Congress is going to -- was going
to abrogate a constitutional right or recognize a
constitutional remedy, it has to do so in a clear way.
And in, for example, Webster v. Doe or, in effect, the
Blatchfield -- Blatchford case, has very similar language.
It's all civil actions, and that's in a context of whether
Indians can bring an action against the State under the
Eleventh Amendment. In that case, the Court held that
all civil actions did not include the right to bring an
action against the Eleventh Amendment -- a State under
the Eleventh Amendment, because you’re dealing with a
constitutional issue.
And in this case -- I think that goes to
Justice Kennedy's point -- we’re not saying that, you know,
any cause of action that perhaps was created after 1970
wouldn't be barred, but when you’re talking about a
constitutional cause of action, there is a difference.
And you -- Congress has to at least consider the issue,
balance the policy considerations, and make an informed
decision in order for this Court to abrogate a
constitutional right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And Carlson is your best
authority for that? Even though I don't think Carlson
is directly on point, Carlson is still your best
authority?
MR. DOYLE: Well, Carlson sets forth the
clear statement rule here, the explicit declaration
test, and then --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In a different context,
but that -- but Carlson is still your best authority for
that proposition?
MR. DOYLE: I think Webster v. Doe is
another example of a case where this Court would not
abrogate a constitutional right based on fairly clear
language that said the director of the CIA had
discretion to terminate anybody. And in that case, he
terminated a CIA employee because he was homosexual, and
he brought a variety of different constitutional causes
of action. And then, you know, the Court held that to
abrogate a constitutional cause of action, there has to
be -- there has to be a clear statement. And so we don't
believe there has been that clear statement, but --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do think your clear
statement argument would apply even if Carlson had been
decided before the statute was enacted?
MR. DOYLE: Well, that's true, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.
MR. DOYLE: And so, it's not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would have
thought it wouldn't apply as strongly because they would
have been saying any action at a time when they knew that
particular action existed.
MR. DOYLE: It wouldn't -- it wouldn't apply
as -- as strongly, but I -- I don't think that the
sequence of enactment is dispositive, I think is the
point.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, so you’re
saying -- your response to Justice Stevens follows
because you say they -- unless they say a Bivens action
is excluded, it's not.
MR. DOYLE: Or constitutional, but it has to
be clear that Congress addressed the issue and
considered abrogating a constitutional claim. I mean,
that's what the cases are clear about. And so --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the Gonzalez Act is
after Bivens.
MR. DOYLE: It is.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say the same
thing -- even though Bivens was before Congress -- and
even though the Gonzalez Act doesn't have an exception for
Bivens claims, you read one into the Gonzalez Act?
MR. DOYLE: Your Honor, I -- I would say the
Gonzalez Act also wouldn't bar Bivens claims, because
it’s just the sequence of enactment -- but I mean, if
it was -- if it had shown in some way that Congress
considered the constitutional issue -- and the legislative
history of the Gonzalez Act shows that it did not at
that time -- if there was some indication in the
language of the statute or anywhere that a
constitutional --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Legislative history will
do, so -- so we don't require this clear statement,
right?
MR. DOYLE: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, I
didn't hear your question.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Legislative history will do
the job, so you’re abandoning the -- the proposition
that there has to be a clear statement by Congress.
MR. DOYLE: No, Your Honor. And if I -- if
I meant to imply that, I misspoke.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what you said. I
thought you said if -- if it was clear from the
legislative history that Congress considered Bivens
actions and nonetheless enacted language similar to
3(a), that wouldn't be enough.
MR. DOYLE: It -- it -- I think that in the
statute, in the -- in the text of the statute itself,
there has to be some evidence from Congress that it
considered it. I think that you can look at other
factors to try to figure out what -- what Congress was
thinking, of course. However, in this case, I think the
point is clear that whether you look at the legislative
history, whether you look at the alternative remedial
scheme --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now you’re confusing me
again.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is -- is important
what Congress was thinking or what Congress said? I
thought your proposition was, unless the statute says
that it bans constitutional actions, it doesn't. Is
that your proposition?
MR. DOYLE: That -- that's correct. You have
to start with the text.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Then it doesn't matter what
Congress was thinking, does it? Unless Congress says
that, your -- your position is --
MR. DOYLE: Well, obviously if -- if the statute
unambiguously bars constitutional claims by mentioning
the Constitution, I don't think you look at the
legislative history. That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But, ah, but if it doesn't
unambiguously bar it, you can then look to legislative
history and say although it didn't bar it, the
legislative history shows that it was intended to bar
MR. DOYLE: I think that if -- if -- if any
statute is ambiguous --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You are abandoning Carlson
then.
MR. DOYLE: -- you can look to the legislative
history.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought Carlson was your
big case.
MR. DOYLE: Well, I believe it is, Your Honor.
And -- and -- and the Carlson test --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You just abandoned its
proposition that there has to be a statement in the
statute.
MR. DOYLE: Your Honor, all I'm saying
is that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You’re not
abandoning it; you’re taking it further. You’re
taking Carlson further. It doesn't have to be -- no?
MR. DOYLE: All I'm saying is, I believe, is
that -- is that in this case, if you look at the actual
statute that's at issue, no matter what test you use,
whether you -- whether you -- whether you like
legislative history, whether you -- whether you only
look at plain text, or whether you want to look at
what's the alternative remedy, is it equivalent to a
constitutional claim, this statute doesn't pass muster.
It is clear that Congress never considered whether or
not to abrogate a constitutional cause of action in
70.
JUSTICE BREYER: I think his point is it doesn't
matter whether they did or didn't consider it; the
question is the statute was decided by Justice Brennan
as an example of a statute where Congress did explicitly
say whatever it thought that this particular remedy was
a remedy exclusive, an exclusive remedy, and that
satisfied the second requirement of Carlson. That was
Justice Ginsburg's first question. And -- and there --
that's, I think, the problem for you in this case.
MR. DOYLE: Your Honor, again, I don't want
to repeat my answer to that question, but just to
emphasize that -- that the Court in Carlson did not
specifically say that Bivens claims were barred by
reference to 233. It mentioned malpractice. And
there is a distinct difference between malpractice and
deliberate indifference in 1980, because Estelle had
been decided 4 years earlier.
So, one of the other anomalies here is that
looking at -- at -- at the practical effect, going to
your implied repeal question, Justice Scalia, the only
work that -- that 233(a) would have left to do under the
Petitioners’ reading is -- is to bar Bivens claims. And
when Congress enacted the statute in 1970, Bivens didn't
even exist.
And so, the protection that -- the -- the
position that we are advocating protects doctors because
the Westfall Act extends much broader immunity to common
law torts, to any wrongful act or omission, not just
actions performing medical functions. And so, this is
completely consistent with Congress's intent in 1970
when constitutional claims didn't even exist.
And so, when Congress looked at the issue,
examined it and decided whether -- whether there’s a
difference between Bivens and the common law and whether
the FTCA was adequate to substitute for Bivens, it made
a decision to expressly preserve Bivens actions in this
case. And even if, Your Honors, you believe that
3 bars Bivens claims here, you have to reconcile it
with the Westfall Act, because the Westfall Act
expressly preserves Bivens claims.
And it is a comprehensive statute; it is
a later passed statute; and it is specific to the issue before
the Court, which is can -- can a Bivens claim be brought
against a Public Health Service doctor?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Westfall Act could be
read to say we’re now covering all these people who did
not have, who were not sheltered by immunity before, but
this amendment saves out Bivens claims. One could read
that as self-contained and not touching other statutes
that existed independently before.
MR. DOYLE: Your Honor, I -- I -- I don't
think that's a reasonable reading, because at the time
of the Westfall Act's passage in 1988, no court had held
that Bivens claims were barred by section 233 or any
other pre-Act immunity statute like the Gonzalez Act or
and the VA Act.
And the legislative history of the Westfall
Act shows that, in 1988, Congress believed that the
Westfall Act would simply extend the protections
available to -- to government employees before Westfall
v. Erwin, and that -- and that people would still be
able to bring constitutional claims against members of
the Federal government.
And so, Congress had no reason in 1988 to
go back and amend the -- the earlier passed 233,
because there was no indication -- judicial construction
or the legislative history -- that 233 ever barred Bivens
claims in the first place.
And so, adopting the Petitioners’ position
in this case would -- would subvert congressional
intent, because it would say that, you know, when
Congress finally weighed all of the considerations in
the case, decided whether Bivens and the FTCA were
adequate, it decided to -- it decided to preserve Bivens
claims rather than bar them.
And -- and -- and so, accepting the
Petitioners’ position would just subvert
that intent based on an Act that was passed prior to
Bivens existing, prior to a constitutional cause of
action being accepted for this type of action, and it --
and it would just be completely inconsistent with what
Congress has -- has done to protect Federal employees.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just be sure I
understand your argument? Is the Westfall Act -- would
it have covered every immunity that the Public Health
Act previously provided? So, is it correct that the --
the prior statute is now totally unnecessary and does
nothing except preserve the Bivens -- preserve the
immunity for Bivens actions?
MR. DOYLE: No, Your Honor, I don't think I
got to finish that answer before. But if you look at --
at the appendix to our -- our brief from page 28
to 62, there’s two pages in there, page 29 and page 55,
that show that section (a) still has meaning, because
there’s a host of non-Federal employees, people that --
that are government contractors that provide services to
free health clinics and the like that can be deemed
employees of the Public Health Service and then take
advantage of their immunity. But otherwise, they
wouldn't be able to take advantage of the immunity
under FTCA, because they aren't Federal employees.
So 233(a) still has work to do, even under
our construction. And so, surely, it would not protect
Public Health Service employees any more because they
have greater protections in the Westfall Act, and, again,
the Petitioners’ reading here would -- the only work it
would have left to do would be to bar Bivens claims, but
Bivens didn't even exist in 1970, when -- that the Act
was passed. That doesn't -- that doesn't make much
common sense.
And before I -- I conclude, I just want to
speak for a moment about, you know, the importance of
this case under the -- the Bivens jurisprudence. I
mean, the purpose of Bivens -- this Court has acknowledged
recently in Meyer and Malesko is to provide deterrence
to -- to Federal officers. And this is exactly the type
of case that -- that -- where deterrence is important,
because government employees should not feel that they
can -- they can --
JUSTICE BREYER: Can't they sue the Federal
Government and collect money?
MR. DOYLE: Not for the -- not for a Bivens
claim, and --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, I mean, can't your
clients -- anybody who has a case like yours -- can't they
sue the Federal Government and collect damages for their
claim?
MR. DOYLE: It depends. Sometimes they can’t.
JUSTICE BREYER: Did your clients sue the
Federal Government?
MR. DOYLE: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Did they collect money?
MR. DOYLE: No, they haven't collected money
yet.
JUSTICE BREYER: No. But if they win, will
they?
MR. DOYLE: On one claim, but one of our
claims, the most important claim here, is -- is -- will
be extinguished under California law, which highlights
why, you know, Congress would not want to -- why this
Court in Carlson, first of all, said that the FTCA is not
an effective substitute for Bivens, and Congress
ratified that decision 8 years later in the Westfall
Act by finding the same thing, that -- that Bivens
claims and the FTCA are complementary and parallel
causes of action, because for the very reason that, under
California law in this case, a survival claim for
pre-death pain and suffering for -- for Mr. Castaneda,
who endured an incredible ordeal for 2 years at the hands
of a government medical provider, that that -- that claim
would be barred.
And so I would urge this Court to follow its
-- its precedent in Carlson and recognize that Congress,
years later in the Westfall Act, actually ratified
that holding that said that the FTCA is not an adequate
substitute for a Bivens action for the reasons I’ve set
forth. Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Goldenberg, you have 3 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. GOLDENBERG: Just two quick points, if
I may. One is that I think you can't read this Court's
Bivens jurisprudence to set forth any kind of clear
statement rule in this context. In many cases after
Carlson was decided, this Court has looked for
indications that Congress thought the judiciary should
stay its hands, and it has found those indications in
the mere existence of some kind of statutory scheme,
even where Congress has said nothing express about
whether that scheme should be exclusive or not.
If it can be the case that, simply by setting
forth an elaborate scheme, Congress can indicate its
intent that this particular implied cause of action
shouldn't go forward, then it must be true also that
where Congress expressly says that it shouldn't go
forward, that that can be given effect.
And I point out that there is not a cutting off
of a constitutional right here. It's just that there is
a specific cause of action that isn't going to be
allowed to go forward because it's one that this Court
would imply.
Secondly, just to go back to my answer to
Justice Kennedy's question before, the case that I meant
to cite to you was Van de Kamp v. Goldstein, 129 Supreme
Court 855, and that talked about absolute immunity
reflecting a balance of evils. Here, I think Congress
has done that balancing. Congress has decided that it
would rather protect the PHS, make sure that causes of
action and liability aren't hanging over the heads of
PHS officers, even if that means that some individuals
don't get recovery against certain specific PHS
personnel on their claims, when they can of course
recover from the United States.
If there are no further questions, we’d
ask that the decision of the Ninth Circuit be reversed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:10 p.m., the case in the
