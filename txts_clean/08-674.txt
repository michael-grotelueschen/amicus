CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Public Utilities Commission.
Mr. Lamken.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LAMKEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
This case concerns a bedrock principle of
Federal -- Federal energy law, the Mobile-Sierra
doctrine. The question presented and the issue decided
below is whether Mobile-Sierra's public interest
standard ceases to apply whenever a contract rate is
challenged by a noncontracting party.
FERC and we agree that the answer is no.
Mobile-Sierra's presumption of --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it matter who is
the challenger? Are you in a different position than
the other parties to this action?
You're a third party who is being bound to a
particular rate. The others do have a different
interest, or they're in a different position with
respect to their challenges, correct?
MR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, I represent -- we
represent -- I represent NRG, which entered into the
settlement agreement and is -- would like to be bound by
the results of the auction contract. And so we are
happy with the agreements we enter into, and a concern
that we have is that nonparties can come in and
challenge the contracts under a lower standard.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So aren't you in a
different position than those other challengers?
MR. LAMKEN: We certainly are in a different
position, but they --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why doesn't that
difference do what the D.C. Circuit said?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lamken, you're not a
challenger?
MR. LAMKEN: That's exactly right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I think --
MR. LAMKEN: We are not a challenger. We
are --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the question relates
to the other side --
MR. LAMKEN: Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- not to his side --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. I do understand
that, but that's what I'm trying to get to. The D.C.
Circuit Court's reasoning was very simple: You're a
contracting party; you're bound to it. Why should the
others who didn't agree to this term be bound by
Mobile-Sierra? That's the essence of their holding.
MR. LAMKEN: Right. Nobody is arguing that
a noncontracting party is bound to terms that it didn't
agree to in a contract.
The question is that, when a noncontracting
party comes in to challenge the terms that two
consenting, willing buyer and a seller have agreed
to, what is the standard that should apply for that
outsider to come in and challenge the rate the two
people have agreed to?
And Mobile-Sierra and Morgan Stanley all
provide the answer, and that is the public interest
standard. The standard is that, under the Mobile-Sierra
doctrine, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must
presume the contract rate meets the just and reasonable
requirement provided by law.
Unless --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So then does that bind
all types of third parties?
MR. LAMKEN: It certainly applies to the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and it would be a
rather odd rule that the agency which is charged with
Congress with administering the statute, has the
greatest expertise, is bound by a more demanding
standard, but an entity, an outsider with no such
statutory mandate and no such expertise is subject to a
lower standard when it comes in and asks for a contract
rate to be overturned or abrogated.
In fact, the court of appeals’ ruling can't
be reconciled with Mobile-Sierra's foundation and the
need for contractual certainty. The whole point is to
provide certainty of contract so that companies can
invest hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure
projects without worrying that their contracts will be
abrogated lightly after the fact. But few could risk
entering into such contracts and make those investments
if any noncontracting party -- if the Mobile-Sierra
doctrine applied only to contracting parties, the two
people who signed the contract. But --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a bit much to
say that the importance is to preserve the stability of
two parties' contract, and, therefore, a third party who
didn't sign the contract is bound to the two parties'
contract.
MR. LAMKEN: Well, the nonparty isn't
actually paying the rate. The two parties are paying
the rate. The nonparty is saying: I'm adversely
affected by that rate indirectly. And we're all
regularly adversely affected by contracts we didn't
enter into. The example we give in our brief is the
theatergoers affected by the amount the theater pays for
the movies and the popcorn and things like that. But
the question is what's the standard for that outsider to
abrogate a rate the two, a willing buyer and a willing
seller, have entered into?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so why don't
you -- why isn't it restricted to some type of direct,
parties directly affected, as well as -- I mean, you
complain about the hordes of people who will be able to
challenge these. Well, it assumes that anybody can
challenge it.
MR. LAMKEN: Well, it certainly applies to
the parties most directly affected, which are the
parties that actually entered into the contract and are
paying the rates. So it applies to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, which is the expert regulator,
and it doesn't make much sense to have another --
another exemption for some category of not directly
bound but sufficiently -- sufficiently affected parties.
It would --
JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any other area of
the law in which the parties to a contract can, in
effect, dictate the substantive standard of
administrative review for challenges raised by
nonparties?
MR. LAMKEN: I think the answer is I don't
know if there is other areas where there's a
possibility of a Memphis clause, if that's what you're
referring to, where the parties can actually –- when
they enter into a contract, they can actually lower the
standard. But the general rule is that when a party
comes in and tries to abrogate a contract, they have no
greater rights to challenge the contract than the
parties who entered it themselves. If they are a
third-party beneficiary, it's the same right. And if
they're a nonparty, at least so far as we can tell, they
have no right to challenge the validity of the contract,
at least as a matter of contract law.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Am I correct -- and maybe
this is more proper for the government than for you, or
for all the parties. I take it no one questions the
propriety, the lawfulness, of the FERC determination to
convene the settlement process? There's no argument
that this was an improper, an unlawful process?
MR. LAMKEN: No. There is certainly no such
claim before this Court, and I'm not aware of any such
one. But what came out of the process were agreements
with respect to rates, and the settled rule is that such
agreements cannot be abrogated unless the public
interest would be severely harmed. And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can I --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Of course, there is.
What's -- what’s really lurking behind this case is
whether this is a contract rate, and there FERC
disagrees with you, I take it. You were talking about
that the rate that emerges from a contract between two
people –- nobody else is party to it, but you say the
rate stands; FERC cannot abrogate the rate; nobody can
ask FERC to abrogate that bilateral contract rate. But
here we're not talking about a bilateral contract, where
how many people were involved in the settlement? Well
over a hundred.
MR. LAMKEN: Scores, yes. And --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that's quite a
different picture than the bilateral contracts that were
at issue in Sierra and Mobile.
MR. LAMKEN: Certainly FERC agrees with us
that at least some of the rates before this Court are
contract rates.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Did the lower court reach
that question?
MR. LAMKEN: No, the lower court didn't
address the question.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Did we grant cert on that
question?
MR. LAMKEN: You did not, and this Court
regularly declines to address matters that were merely
assumed or presumed by the court below and instead
answers the question that was actually answered by the
court below, which in this case is an important and
recurring question. Based on the decision below, FERC
has actually gone back and rewritten more than 50
contracts to create an exemption for noncontracting
parties, including contracts that are clearly bilateral
contracts, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry? What do
you mean, an exemption for noncontracting parties?
MR. LAMKEN: Simply to say that the
Mobile-Sierra doctrine can't apply when the challenge is
brought by a noncontracting party, but rather what FERC
wrote into the contracts effectively was the highest
standard permitted by law will be applied to them. And
nobody sitting at these tables can tell this Court what
that standard would be, which is precisely why this is
an important issue.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't agree that
FERC has the authority to exempt noncontracting parties
from the binding effect of the contract rates, do you?
MR. LAMKEN: No, we don't, which is
precisely one of the -- we don't believe that the court
had authority to announce that rule. We actually
believe the court erred in announcing that rule. It --
JUSTICE BREYER: It isn't in the case.
MR. LAMKEN: Yes. Whether or not these are
contracted --
JUSTICE BREYER: This is a case in which, as
I think most cases where they approve contracts, what
they're finding is that the contract rate in this
circumstance, or here the settlement rate in this
circumstance, is a just and reasonable rate, because.
All right? So what are we supposed to do? I mean, are
you going to say he's wrong, the lower court's wrong,
because they got the whole thing mixed up. I mean –-
could we say that?
MR. LAMKEN: Yes. The lower court got
everything wrong, it got the whole thing mixed up; send
it back.
(Laughter.)
MR. LAMKEN: Very simple and very
straightforward.
JUSTICE BREYER: But then if we were to do
that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: He took the words right out
of your mouth.
(Laughter.)
MR. LAMKEN: Thank you, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: But you would -- would you
agree with my assumptions there?
MR. LAMKEN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: That what this case is
about -- and it's a fortiori from the ordinary contract
case -- is that sometimes an agency, because of
particular economic circumstances, concludes that a
particular rate-setting system is a just and reasonable
system, and once that's in place, then as part of that
system is the rule you can only challenge it when it
violates the public interest, for example.
Now, you can go and attack the whole
business on the ground the whole business is an abuse of
discretion or it departs from the statute. But if the
whole business is okay, that's the end of it.
MR. LAMKEN: Right. I --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, have I just said the
correct law in your view or not?
MR. LAMKEN: We would not -- that, Justice
Breyer, in fact would be our back-up position.
JUSTICE BREYER: Sorry?
MR. LAMKEN: That would be our back-up
position. Our position is once you have --
JUSTICE BREYER: But I'm not interested in
if you have a back-up or not. I'm interested in, is it
correct or not?
MR. LAMKEN: Yes, we would agree with it,
that that is a correct statement of law. But our
primary position and the primary error in the court
below was it said even when you have a contract rate,
nonparty -- there is an exemption based on the identity
of the challenging party. And that simply cannot be
reconciled with –-
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you just said to
Justice Scalia that the court below didn't find that
this was a contract rate.
MR. LAMKEN: That's right. It merely
assumed it. And this Court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It assumed it, so you're
asking us to assume the same thing and announce --
MR. LAMKEN: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- an advisory opinion
that if these are contract rates, they're bound by
Mobile-Sierra; and if they're not, what are we supposed
to do?
MR. LAMKEN: Well, the answer is that this
Court regularly, regularly, addresses the question
presented and the issue answered below without delving
into underlying assumptions.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You could call them all
advisory opinions if you want.
MR. LAMKEN: That's right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Whenever there is another
issue in the case --
MR. LAMKEN: Right, and one example --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for which we remand, you
could say, oh, we're just giving an advisory opinion on
the issue that --
MR. LAMKEN: That's precisely right. A good
example would be Jama v. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement, where the question was whether the Attorney
General could deport an alien to a foreign country
without making sure the country would accept him. And
the Court said: We're not going to address whether the
person is an alien; we won't address whether Somalia is
a country; we're not going to even address whether this
person is removable -- that's all for the court on
remand; we're only going to address whether or not there
has to be a prior determination that the country will
accept him. The same rule would apply --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Could you give me an
example of a -- of a challenge to a rate that's set
under this whole program that would succeed under the
just and reasonable standard and fail under the public
interest standard, or vice versa?
MR. LAMKEN: Are you asking me can I
conceive of such a rate that would fail and succeed
under one?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. LAMKEN: I think that -- one of the –
one of the interesting things about the just and
reasonable standard, the ordinary just and reasonable
standard, is you can actually look at the interests of
the contracting parties to a degree that you cannot
under the public interest standard. The point of the
public interest standard is it has to adversely affect
the interests of the public. The whole point --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure that answers
my question. Could there be -- could there be a rate
that would violate one standard and not the other?
MR. LAMKEN: Well, they are both the just
and reasonable standard. And the one could violate one
application --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes or no?
MR. LAMKEN: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.
MR. LAMKEN: If I may reserve the remainder
of the time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Miller.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FERC,
IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The court of appeals erred in holding that
the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard is
inapplicable when contract rates are challenged by a
noncontracting third party. That error provides a
sufficient basis for reversing the judgment below, and
although there are other issues in the case, those
issues were not addressed by the court of appeals, and
this Court should remand and allow them to be resolved
by the court of appeals rather than addressing them
itself in the first instance.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were the -- are the
Respondents correct and was the court of appeals correct
in calling this a presumption?
MR. MILLER: This Court in Morgan Stanley
described --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in calling the rate
that was agreed upon a presumption of a reasonable rate?
MR. MILLER: Well, the -- the Court in
Morgan Stanley held that Mobile-Sierra rests in part on
the idea that when wholesale businesses negotiate a
contract for the sale of power, that that can be
presumed to be just and reasonable.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you don't quarrel with
that word --
MR. MILLER: No. We quarrel --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- or would you quarrel
with that characterization?
MR. MILLER: That's the way that this
Court has described the standard. Now, of course, in
this case the Commission looked at the mechanism
created, the forward capacity auction, and it looked at
the transition rates, and it didn't simply presume them
to be just and reasonable. It -- based on its
examination of them -- determined that the rates set out
in the settlement and the rates that would be
established under the mechanism created by the
settlement would be just and reasonable.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Just and reasonable, or
would comply with the public interest standard?
MR. MILLER: The --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what's the use of
having Mobile-Sierra if -- if they're going to reexamine
the thing under the usual standard anyway?
MR. MILLER: Well, the settlement -- no one
is suggesting that the settlement agreement itself is a
Mobile-Sierra contract. The settlement was a resolution
of a disputed proceeding before the Commission. It's
sort of analogous to a consent decree. The Commission
had to approve that before it became effective. By its
own terms, the settlement agreement wouldn't become
effective as binding between the parties unless the
Commission approved it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your opening
statement about what this Court should do is a change
from your statement of what we should do in your briefs.
In your -- you just said the Court should
remand for further considerations other issues. In your
brief, you say the judgment of the court of appeals
should be reversed insofar as it granted the petitions
for review. You've changed your position on what we
should do.
MR. MILLER: Well, we -- we do think that
you should reverse the holding of the court of appeals.
To the extent that you think that there are other issues
that are presented other than the question presented as
stated by the petition.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a change.
Before you didn't think there were other issues that
affected the determination or might. You said we should
grant -- reverse the determination insofar as it granted
the petitions for review.
If we say that the petitions for review
should have been denied, then we don't send it back.
MR. MILLER: Should have been granted.
Right. Yes. Right. That's right.
It -- I mean, our view is that the
appropriate disposition is a remand to the court of
appeals to allow it to decide whether these other issues
are properly before it, and the answer to that may be –-
be no, but the court of appeals should have an
opportunity to consider that in the first instance.
The reason that, in our view, the court of
appeals was wrong in holding that there's a third-party
exception to Mobile-Sierra is that, as I said a moment
ago, the Court in Morgan Stanley recognized that
Mobile-Sierra rests on a presumption that the rates
negotiated between sophisticated wholesale businesses
can be presumed to be just and reasonable. That's a
feature of the rate. There is no reason why the same
rate for the same power could be just and reasonable
when it's challenged by one person, but not when it's
challenged by somebody else.
Second, the purpose of the public interest
test under Mobile-Sierra is to allow contract
modification only when it's necessary to protect third
parties; that is, members of the public. So it doesn't
make sense to say that that test is inapplicable
whenever you have a challenge that's presented by one of
those third parties or a member of the public.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there -- what would
happen in a situation in which there's a tariff price
instead of a contract price? In those situations, the
buyer could come in, presumably, and say: It's not a
fair and just price vis-à-vis me; I didn't agree to it;
it's not.
In a normal situation with a contract price,
third parties, many not -- not the main -- main
parties, like the Maine Public Utilities Commission,
could come in and say what? It's not fair to the public
in general?
MR. MILLER: In the contract setting?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes.
MR. MILLER: Yes, third parties could come
in, and if they -- they would have to satisfy the public
interest test. They would have to show that there are
-- the Court has described it variously as extraordinary
circumstances, severe impact on the public interest.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could they come in and
show that between the contracting parties the price is
unfair? Is that what this is about, that they would try
to come in and somehow define the public interest as
being informed by the unfairness to the individual
parties?
MR. MILLER: I think that sort of argument
would be foreclosed by Sierra.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's the
question before us.
MR. MILLER: Well, you have --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The D.C. Circuit said
they shouldn't be bound by that determination, and
you're arguing that they should be because --
MR. MILLER: What -- what the Court said in
Sierra is that mere unfairness, one of the -- the fact
that one of the contracting parties got a bad bargain is
not a reason to set aside the contract, except for the
Court did reserve the extraordinary circumstance where
it's going to put the supplier out of business, which
would adversely affect the public interest if they can
no longer deliver power at that rate.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it goes back to my
original question with your adversary, which is: Is
there a difference among the objectors here, between
those who are objecting to the terms between the two
contracting parties as outsiders, as members of the
public, and those who are objecting because this
settlement agreement does something different? It binds
them personally to a buying price, and so why shouldn't
there be a different approach to those individuals?
MR. MILLER: I think there are two responses
to that, Your Honor. The first is that the reasoning of
the court of appeals draws no distinction between those
two --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I agree.
MR. MILLER: Okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so the
question is: Should there be a distinction?
MR. MILLER: Yes. And I think certainly the
Commission appreciates the idea that there's something
wrong about -- or there's something unfair about A and B
getting together and deciding on the rate that C is
going to pay. And to the extent that you're concerned
about that situation, the answer to that is that when A
and B set the rate that C has to pay, C is not paying a
contract rate in the Mobile-Sierra sense, because C is
not -- C is paying a rate it has not agreed to.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that's what the
Third Circuit -- I'm sorry, that's what the court below
didn't --
MR. MILLER: The court did not use that mode
of analysis. The court below said that we were talking
about contract rates and their being challenged by
nonparties to the contract, and the court thought that
in that context the Mobile-Sierra public interest
standard doesn't apply, and that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying, in effect,
that Mobile-Sierra does not apply to an agreement
between A and B that not only sets the rate between the
two, but also fixes the rate that one of them will
charge to C?
The last feature is not a Mobile-Sierra --
is not eligible for Mobile-Sierra treatment.
MR. MILLER: That's right, because C's rate
in that scenario is not a rate that it has agreed to.
It's being set unilaterally by people other than it, and
so it's in our view more appropriately characterized as
a tariff rate that is not subject to the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. But that's -- but
that's not what the D.C. Circuit said.
MR. MILLER: No, that is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The D.C. Circuit said that
the entire -- there is no application of Mobile-Sierra
at all.
MR. MILLER: That's right. And the
D.C. Circuit made that quite clear, particularly on page
a of the petition appendix in its opinion, where it
described the question before it, yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it is your view, is it
not, that the rates that result from the auction are not
contract rates within the meaning of Mobile-Sierra?
MR. MILLER: That -- that is our view, that
that's -- it's not the basis for the court of appeals’
decision.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The court of appeals
never got to what FERC thinks is the heart of the case,
whether this is a contract rate, whether -- you say it
is not -- and whether FERC has the authority nonetheless
to apply the public interest standard. But none of
those have been addressed by the D.C. Circuit.
MR. MILLER: That's -- that’s exactly right,
Your Honor. The court didn't reach --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And just to follow
up, you think we should not address either of those --
MR. MILLER: No --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether it's a
contract or whether you have authority to make an
exception to the Mobile-Sierra doctrine?
MR. MILLER: No, we think the Court should
answer only the question that was ruled upon below and
leave those other issues to the extent that they have
been properly --
JUSTICE BREYER: How can we? I mean, that's
a -- why not answer a case -- a question about
employment discrimination law? Where -- where in this
FERC thing does this say that these are contracts of a
kind that Mobile-Sierra was about? I mean, I don't even
know if Mobile-Sierra -- whether you could -- a third
party could attack such a contract under public – under
a just and reasonable standard, unless I knew first what
the Commission thought about it in this context, because
then the Commission's question would be: Is that a
reasonable view? So what am I supposed to do here?
MR. MILLER: Well, I think we agree with
Petitioners that it is quite common for this Court to
decide a case, taking the case on the same assumption
that the court of appeals did, and answer the questions
that are raised --
JUSTICE BREYER: We would have to take it on
the assumption -- wait, I don't want -- you have 5
minutes left that you're reserving?
MR. MILLER: I’m not --
--
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't get to
reserve time.
MR. MILLER: Right. Right.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: What's the assumption? The
assumption is the court of appeals thinks that the
contract between -- among the generating -- the
generators, that that is a Mobile-Sierra contract. So
we're supposed to say, if that were a Mobile-Sierra
contract, which it isn't, then we should decide whether
a third party could attack it, about which the
Commission has said nothing. Is that right?
MR. MILLER: No, Your Honor, because we do
agree that at least some of the rates that are covered
by the public interest review clause in the settlement
JUSTICE BREYER: The transition rates?
MR. MILLER: The transition rates as between
the settling parties.
JUSTICE BREYER: But the reasonableness
depends upon the other. The validity depends upon the
other. It's all part of a package.
MR. MILLER: Well, their validity doesn't –-
their validity depends upon the mechanism that's created
by the settlement, which the Commission reviewed under
the ordinary just and reasonable standard. It doesn't
depend on the clearing prices of the auctions, which
are the -- I mean, what the --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's all true, but I
would want to know what the Commission thought about
that one, too.
MR. MILLER: What -- what the Commission
thought is that the -- the Commission looked at the
auction mechanism and determined that it was likely to
produce just and reasonable results. And the Commission
emphasized that at any point anybody can come in and
challenge the auction rules and say that they're not
just and reasonable, and the Commission will review that
entirely unencumbered by this provision of the
settlement. And, in addition, within 45 days after each
auction, anybody can come in and challenge those
results. And only after that 45-day period does the
public interest review clause become effective.
The -- the last point I would like to make
about the court of appeals' analysis is that this Court
made clear in Morgan Stanley that Mobile-Sierra applies
to the Commission when it is acting sua sponte, and
there is no reason why FERC's power should depend on
whether somebody has filed a complaint. If FERC is
bound, public interest standard, under Mobile-Sierra
when there is a Mobile-Sierra contract, it makes very
little sense to say that it ceases to be bound by that
as long as anybody in the world other than the
contracting party comes in and files the complaint to
initiate the FERC investigation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we -- we don't know
that that's the other side's position. I was going to
ask him that. Their position is that the third party
can -- can attack the -- the agreement without being
encumbered by Mobile-Sierra, but I don't know that
they've said that once a third party does mount such an
attack the Commission is suddenly also unencumbered by
Mobile-Sierra.
MR. MILLER: Well, the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I have assumed that their
position is the Commission remains bound by Mobile-
Sierra, but these third parties can -- can demand a
court -- that a court apply a different standard.
MR. MILLER: I had not understood that to be
their position, but I think it would be very strange --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We can --
MR. MILLER: -- if the Commission had one
Standard, and on review of the Commission order, the
court were to apply a standard different from what --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that's any
stranger than saying the Commission has one standard
until somebody else challenges it, whereupon the
Commission has a different standard. You don't think
that's strange?
MR. MILLER: I -- I think we would agree
that they're both quite strange.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
(Laughter.)
MR. MILLER: If there are no further
questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Miller.
MR. MILLER: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Blumenthal.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:
There is one central truth here on which we
and the government agree. These are not contract rates
at issue here. They are tariff rates. That is a
central truth that unites the government and the
Respondents, because these rates out of the auction
process will be rates of general applicability, applying
not only to those contractors, the parties who agreed to
the contract, but they will be binding on NSTAR, which
sells 25 percent of the power in the New England market;
they will be binding on the other five Respondents,
including Maine and Massachusetts as well as
Connecticut.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, they can
self-supply, can't they?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Even if they had that
option, Justice Sotomayor, it would not change a tariff
into a contract. Just because there is the option of
self-supply doesn't mean that parties who are disputing
the contract, disagreeing with it, not to mention not
contracting, should be bound to it as though it were a
contract. The option of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They're not bound to it.
They -- they are saying that -- claiming -- that their
rates are too high because the contract was too high, so
-- and therefore, their rates are unreasonable. And
what Mobile-Sierra says -- it certainly says it as
between the two contracting parties -- that if it's at
arm-length between sophisticated seller and buyer
of -- of the power, they are bound by it, and
the -- and the issue is here is whether somebody
downstream who says that since this contract is so
exorbitant, the rates are too high, whether that person
is likewise bound by Mobile-Sierra. Isn't that right?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Justice Scalia, with all
due respect, that situation is not here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's what the court
of appeals decided. Their simple question was
Mobile-Sierra binds the contracting parties, and it
doesn't -- the rate doesn't stick for anybody else.
That's all they decided.
And the question that you're asking
certainly is looming over this whole case, but it isn't
presented to us because it wasn't even dealt with in any
way, shape, or manner by the D.C. Circuit.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Absolutely correct, Justice
Ginsburg. The D.C. Circuit's reasoning here was based
on facts that were, in fact, not present here. We
agreed then, we argued to the FERC, we argued to the
court of appeals, we argued in opposition to certiorari,
that what's involved here are tariff rates.
And the D.C. Circuit's ruling in our view
was correct, and its reasoning was correct insofar as
Mobile-Sierra binds contracting parties, as Justice
Scalia has just articulated and Morgan Stanley
reiterated. It involves parties trying to escape an
improvident bargain.
What we have here is an auction system that
sets rules of general applicability.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought one large
difference -- I thought Justice Scalia suggested that
the rate negotiated by -- in that bilateral agreement,
that that rate would not be subject to just and
reasonable attack by anyone, that the public interest
standard attaches to that rate and FERC can't abrogate
it. It's a rate that's set, it's binding on FERC, and
FERC presumably, because it has no authority to abrogate
it, could not entertain any complaint that would ask to
have it abrogated.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Section 4.C of the
settlement agreement that FERC approved under the just
and reasonable standard says to the world: We can make
an exception for ourselves under the just and
reasonable -- under the Memphis rule. We can make an
exception to the public interest standard. The
government says it can make an exception for itself.
The only ones powerless to invoke --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't -- I didn’t
follow. I didn't think there was -- was there a Memphis
clause in this settlement?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: There is. There is in
section 4.C in effect a modified Memphis clause which
says that the parties can come together and agree to a
different standard, Justice Ginsburg.
So, in a sense, the irony here, if the Court
were to reverse and apply Morgan Stanley -- I'm sorry,
Mobile-Sierra and Morgan Stanley -- would be that the
only ones powerless to invoke the just and reasonable
standard to review the auction rates would be the
Respondents --
JUSTICE BREYER: Why?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: -- who never agreed to this
supposed contract.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why are you powerless?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: I’m sorry.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why don't you to go to the
Commission and say: Commission, there is always special
circumstances. You may think that in this kind of
situation, which is a special situation, that the public
interest standard, whether it's in a contract or whether
it's in a tariff or wherever you want to put it, is the
right standard for review. You may think that. But you
don't think it for yourselves, you don't think it for
somebody else, and here's some reasons why you don't
think it for us.
And if they agree with your reasons, they'll
say: Fine, go ahead. And if they don't, they don't.
Why aren't you exactly as powerful or powerless as
anybody else?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Justice Breyer, there is an
immense difference, as you and the Court is well aware
because it has been articulated in opinions, between the
public interest standard and the ordinary just and
reasonable standard, and the government would like that
discretion to say in effect --
JUSTICE BREYER: My point is if you don't
like that as applied to your situation, you have a
remedy. That's what the public -- that's why they're
there, agencies. They are there to listen to you and
give you a remedy, and the remedy is, if you convince
them you shouldn't be subject to that, they'll say fine;
and otherwise not. Why are you coming to us who know
nothing about natural gas and asking us to do it?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: We're not here by choice,
Your Honor.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: It's electricity.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: If you tell me at this
point to go home, I'm happy to do it.
(Laughter.)
MR. BLUMENTHAL: We're here because we
believe that the section 4.C establishes a standard that
is contrary to the statute, the just and reasonable
standard.
JUSTICE BREYER: Then you're going to say
you mean they never can do it, but it's well settled.
It's well settled that they sometimes can say -- I mean,
my point is this: I just found the quote I was looking
for. So I was thinking natural gas. It applies to
electricity capacity, too. Justice Jackson: "The
wealth of Midas and the wit of man cannot produce or
reproduce a natural gas field."
That applies to electricity capacity. We
can't reproduce it. You can't. The Commission devises
a system for trying to get it done, and if they do it
reasonably, they win.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: But the -- the Commission
should not be accorded discretion to adopt a standard
that contravenes the statute. We're dealing here --
JUSTICE BREYER: The standard -- the statute
is "just and reasonable." That calls up a whole
mechanism from the 1930s. I thought that it is long --
we're long past that point, that -- that whatever
Brandeis thought it was, which they did in the thirties
and forties, that it has also been interpreted to
include the power to the Commission to deviate from
that, because they find, for example, contract rates
under certain circumstances to be just and reasonable,
even though you don't use cost-of-service ratemaking.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: What we're dealing with in
this case is the question of whether the government and
the Commission should have virtually unbridled
discretion to adopt a standard that has been called
"practically insurmountable," as recently as Morgan
Stanley. It was --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- that's because
of section 4.C, you say?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Section 4.C of the
agreement --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Which -- which
gives the Commission a good deal of flexibility, which
you say you -- your clients don't have or your State
doesn't have. But that isn't the basis on which this
case was decided below. It was decided on the very
simple basis that the Mobile-Sierra doctrine simply does
not apply to challenges by third parties. It had
nothing to do with the details of 4.C and the -- the
excessive discretion given -- given to the Commission
but not to you.
It was a very simple proposition on which we
granted cert, whether Mobile-Sierra's public interest
standard applies when a contract rate is challenged by
an entity that was not a party to the contract. That's
the question. And what's your answer to that?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Our answer is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you support the opinion
of the -- of the court below?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: We do support it, Justice
Scalia, and the reason we do is that Mobile-Sierra is
about contracts. And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't about contracts.
It's about reasonable rates. I thought what it was, was
a determination by the Commission, approved by -- by
this Court, that when two giants of the industry, very
knowledgeable, deal at arm's-length and come up with --
with a contract, that is presumptively reasonable, and
unless it contravenes the public interest, that rate
will -- will be upheld.
Now, you say it should be upheld only
between the two contracting parties. What good does
that do?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: It -- it can be held --
upheld only between the two contracting parties if
they're the ones who have agreed to it. Under
Mobile-Sierra, there is a presumption of free
negotiation and consent.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the rationale is the
commonsense notion that it's a presumptively reasonable
rate, and if that's true, how is that altered by the
identity of the party that attacks it?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Because, Your Honor, the
question also is what the standard should be if it's
presumptively reasonable; and it is taken as such,
because it is freely negotiated, because there is
consent to it. Because one of them is seeking to escape
it, and use the Commission to escape it, then
Mobile-Sierra says it should be presumed just and
reasonable, and only when the public interest is
seriously harmed --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why is -- why is it
not presumptively a commonsense notion when some
different party attacks it? It -- it's still a
determination that this rate, as a commonsense matter,
is presumptively reasonable.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: As to this case, again,
there are no rates yet. We're talking about an auction
mechanism that will not even involve a contract, and the
government says so as well, that -- we and the
government agree that it will not involve a contract.
So how can --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. That's different
than Mobile-Sierra, although Mobile-Sierra did invoke
market forces of another kind -- of another kind.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Well, you know, I feel,
with all due respect, that we are talking in alternate
universes here, the government and the Petitioners and
we; and the reason is, as the Court has quite aptly
identified, the court of appeals used a rationale that
simply is not wholly fitting to the facts here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why shouldn’t we tell
them that, and then they can pick it up from there?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Well --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because what they did say
could be -- have heavy consequences. We know that that
has already happened. FERC has revised a number of
contracts to conform to the D.C. Circuit's idea that
it's the parties to the -- to the contract, not the rate
that's sheltered by Mobile-Sierra. That's a very
consequential decision, and so we would tell the D.C.
Circuit, if we agreed with FERC and the Petitioners on
that: D.C. Circuit, you've got that wrong.
Now, there may be other matters, other
issues like the ones that you would like us to decide as
a matter of first view, but as Justice Scalia has
pointed out more than once, we have a question. It is
the very question that the D.C. Circuit decided. Why
should we go beyond that?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Because addressing that
question, Justice Ginsburg, as Justice Breyer said, is
not the question that the Commission addressed. It
isn't the question in terms of the factual situation
here that is really at issue. We're dealing here with
tariff rates that are set through the auction mechanism.
If the Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but we don't like to
decide these questions, you know, initially. We -- we
like to have some lower court do the dirty work, and we
can correct them.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: It’s -- it's a lot easier
that way, and we're more likely to reach a correct
result, rather than -- than wading in with, you know,
-- from scratch. That's our usual practice.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: And the government's
position on certiorari was that there should be a remand
without reversal for reconsideration in light of Morgan
Stanley.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're in a very
tough position because of the way this has progressed.
I think you can make a strong argument that you
shouldn't be bound by these contract rates if FERC
doesn't have a lot of discretion to let you go. If FERC
has a lot of discretion to let you go, your argument
that you shouldn't be bound is a lot weaker. And the
way the case has been presented, we're pushing on only
one -- one side of that.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: And I recognize that fact,
Mr. Chief Justice, that the Court is presented with a
dilemma here because it's dealing with tariff rates when
the question presented talks about contract rates.
JUSTICE BREYER: So is the answer then
maybe where Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia were
going, that -- because where I’m coming from, why I have
been asking this, is I actually think the answer to the
question so far on the question presented is
"sometimes." Sometimes you can't; sometimes you can.
And it depends on a lot of things -- situations,
circumstances, arguments to commissions, what they held,
et cetera.
So maybe that's the thing to do, you answer
the question, say "sometimes." Sometimes they can use
one; sometimes it's the other. Indeed, in this very
case, they've argued that it's -- that it's not even
within the mainstream of Mobile-Sierra. And maybe
that's so, maybe it's not. Send it back, say it depends
on circumstances, time, et cetera. And then they can
argue all these things out that we've just been hearing.
What about that?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: And, Justice Breyer, the
"sometimes" is absolutely right from our standpoint.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if we
ruled that --
MR. BLUMENTHAL: There may be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we decided it on
that basis, we would be giving FERC a victory on the
question of its authority to depart from Mobile-Sierra,
even though that wasn't presented in this case.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: No. In our view, Mr. Chief
Justice, noncontracting parties under Mobile-Sierra
cannot be bound --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I know --
MR. BLUMENTHAL: -- by tariff rates.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but Justice
Breyer was hypothesizing that sometimes they can be, and
sometimes they can't be. And you accepted his
proposition.
And what I'm saying is that's a very
significant question. FERC wants to argue it here, but
it's not before us.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: The “sometimes” -- if I
could complete the answer, Mr. Chief Justice, is that
the “sometimes” would include contract rates. In other
words, where there are strictly contract rates –-
whereas, here, we have tariff rates -- FERC would not
have that discretion. It cannot have discretion to
apply the public interest standard to tariff rates any
more than it could apply the ordinary just and
reasonable standard to contract rates which --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Has anybody before --
MR. BLUMENTHAL: -- Mobile-Sierra fits.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- even suggested that
Mobile-Sierra is a “sometimes” thing? Do -- did
any of our opinions say that it's a “sometimes” thing,
except in one respect, and that is the doctrine does not
apply when -- when, downstream, the rates -- or even
between the parties, the rates would violate the public
interest?
That's a “sometimes.” It won't apply then,
but have we ever suggested that, you know, today it
may; tomorrow it -- it won't? Or have we ever suggested
what standards might determine the “sometimes” question?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Mobile- --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Have we ever suggested how
you can -- you can have a “sometimes” doctrine which
will produce the stability in the industry that Mobile-
Sierra was intended to produce?
I mean, that was the whole purpose of
Mobile-Sierra. People had to be able to predict whether
they can take natural gas out of the ground, how much
they can make on it, and once they enter into an
arm's-length contract, they should be able to rely on
That was the whole purpose. And, now, you
want to us say, well, sometimes it will work, and
sometimes it won't. And we're not going to say when;
we're going to leave it to the D.C. Circuit to invent
some “sometimes.”
That doesn't make any sense, does it?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Again, I may have been
unclear, and I apologize if I was, in response to
Justice Breyer and the Chief Justice's question, but the
point is that the “sometimes” would not apply to the
situation that we have here, where there are rates of
general applicability and tariffs.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I -- can I go –-
stop you there, just so that we're all on the same page?
If this were, hypothetically, a contract rate -- some of
the transition fees appear to be. The parties to that
agreement are saying, we're going to pay, in transition
fees, X amount.
Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the
transition fees are contract rates, are you disputing
the circuit court's analysis that the Mobile-Sierra
doctrine applies to those contract rates and binds third
parties who are challenging that particular rate between
those two parties?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Justice Sotomayor, we are
not challenging that a contract should bind those two
parties or those hundred-plus parties that agree to the
contract.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that -- you
can't because that's the doctrine. Okay.
Under what circumstances could a third party
challenge that rate as not fair and reasonable, as
opposed to being contrary to the public interest?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Well, the public interest
standard, as articulated in Morgan Stanley, would
require showing an extraordinarily high burden of proof.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't answered my
question.
Under what circumstances -- I've given you
the absolute minimum example.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: If --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There’s a rate set
between two parties, what third parties -- under what
circumstances could a third party come in and say -- on
some standard different than contrary to the public
interest, how could they prove other that that rate's
not fair and reasonable?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: If that party were directly
affected --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What does the word
"directly affected" mean to you?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: It would mean having to pay
rates that flow inevitably --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Now, you're trying
to confuse the issue. Yes, that's the auction question
and whether that auction is a contract price subject to
the Mobile-Sierra doctrine at all. That's a different
issue.
I've given you the simple hypothetical.
Could all of those other respondents -- except NSTAR --
come in and say that it's not fair and reasonable
to me because, at the end, I'm going to pay more; I'm
going to do something -- it's going to affect me in some
indirect way.
Are you taking the position that there's
something else that FERC must do when those third
parties come into -- into that simple situation?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Our position, Justice
Sotomayor -- and it's a hypothetical here because,
again -- and I apologize for belaboring the point, but
what we have here are rates of general applicability.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You want to keep going
back to the facts, and I'm dealing with a
hypothetical.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: And the hypothetical, I
would say, is answerable that the just and reasonable
standard, as it was applied in Bridgeport Energy and
Milford Power and tens of other cases --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are taking the
extreme -- you are accepting that -- what the lower
court said? Under every circumstance, if it involves a
contract price, fair and reasonable being something
other than contrary to the public interest?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Fair and reasonable is a
standard different from the public interest standard.
That's a matter of law.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your adversary's
arguments that what you're really saying is you can
never have finality to a contract agreement between
parties because any third party can come in and raise --
stand in the shoes of the contracting parties and argue
the rate's not fair and reasonable?
JUSTICE SCALIA: But FERC can’t -- can FERC
-- can FERC challenge, too? Because FERC's a -- sort of
a third party.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Well, FERC is -- is bound
by the same law that applies to third parties, which is
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So -- so
Mobile-Sierra doesn't apply to FERC, even?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Mobile-Sierra applies --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Who does it apply to? I
mean, it's just -- just the two parties?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Mobile-Sierra effectively
says those two parties are bound by the contract, and
FERC is bound by it -- that's Morgan Stanley –- no
matter when the issue is raised.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: And a noncontracting party,
if it is a rate that applies generally, can challenge
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can a noncontracting party
go to FERC and challenge it before FERC, whereupon FERC
is no longer bound by Mobile-Sierra? Or is FERC
suddenly unchained when a third party brings a
proceeding before FERC? It's a strange situation.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: FERC is bound by the just
and reasonable standard. That's what the law says.
This law is a public -- is a consumer protection statute
that says, upon complaint or upon FERC's own motion, it
may apply that just and reasonable standard.
Now, the public interest standard looks for
serious harm to the public.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. The public
interest standard is a just and reasonable standard.
What -- what it amounts to is saying, when -- when you
have a contract rate that's been negotiated between
sophisticated parties, that rate is presumptively just
and reasonable, and the only way you can show that it is
not just and reasonable is to show that the public
interest is harmed.
It's -- it's not something different from
the just and reasonable standard, or it would be
contrary to -- to the statute because the statute
requires that the rates be just and reasonable, right?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: It -- it is part –- they
are one standard, as Morgan Stanley very clearly says,
and the question of what noncontracting parties can
challenge a statute depends on who the noncontracting
party is, the nature of the contract, what interest is
affected, and I would presume some of those factors
might affect FERC's judgment.
JUSTICE BREYER: So are you aware of any law
or any statement by any judge, ever, that exempts the --
the FERC from the basic requirement that its rules,
regulations, and everything else not be arbitrary,
capricious, abuse of discretion?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: The answer to that question
is no.
JUSTICE BREYER: No. Okay. Thank you.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: And so, as long as that's
so, I guess you could mount a challenge on the ground
that to apply the contract regime system to circumstance
X, Y, and Z, without permitting your challenge that you
want, is, in fact, a violation of the APA, at the least.
Okay?
Now, that's why I say "sometimes." Could
you imagine such a situation, which I think is what
Justice Sotomayor was getting at, or do you want it all
the time? If you want it all the time, I'm not --
you're not getting sympathy from me. If want to say
there could be such a time, maybe. I think I could
think of five. All right?
So -- so where are we?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Where we are is, if Your
Honor please, if the Court were to modify or clarify the
public interest standard to make it more accommodating
to the kinds of challenges we've been discussing, that
could be one outcome here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a third standard
between just and reasonable and public interest? You
want us to add another tier?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: Well, simply to clarify
that it involves not necessarily an insurmountable
barrier.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's also a third
question that's not presented, right?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: It is again a question not
presented, and none of us so far on this side of the
table has mentioned the Chenery doctrine, but perhaps
that also should be considered, that the agency made a
decision on a different basis than it is now advocating
before the Court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are defending the
D.C. Circuit's decision? I mean, you are up here saying
that was the right judgment, Sierra-Mobile --
Mobile-Sierra has to do with the two contracting
parties. It doesn't, as the counterargument goes,
shelter the rate from any attack by anyone, including
FERC. It's put in terms of FERC cannot abrogate that
rate. But your -- you are defending the position that
it's just as between the contracting parties; it's not
the rate itself that is sheltered by Mobile-Sierra,
because that's what the D.C. Circuit decided?
MR. BLUMENTHAL: And -- yes, Justice
Ginsburg, we're defending the D.C. Circuit's ruling and
decision. The question presented, in a sense, takes a
different view of the factual situation that the
government and we agree prevails here, and we are
suggesting that perhaps for the D.C. Circuit to have
said in its opinion Mobile-Sierra does not apply to
noncontracting parties when there are contracts that
produce tariff rates.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It didn't say that.
MR. BLUMENTHAL: And one modifier would have
spared this Court and ourselves the difficulties that we
now have, but it is that modifier that would, in effect,
surmount the very difficult and thorny issues that the
Court has well identified here.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Lamken, you have 3 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LAMKEN: Thank you, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does anything in your
argument turn on the fact that the Respondents were
parties to the settlement process?
MR. LAMKEN: No, Your Honor. The fact that
they were parties to the settlement process simply shows
that they've met the sort of broad administrative law
standing requirements. It does not show they were an
actual purchaser under the agreements here.
And I think that is actually part of the nub
of what was bothering the D.C. Circuit. The D.C.
Circuit may have been bothered that there might be
actual purchasers here, people who directly themselves
purchase under the rate who haven't agreed to it. But
that concern is wholly subsumed within the notion of
whether or not the rate that entity is paying is a
contract rate. But which rates here are contract rates
or not contract rates is an issue the D.C. Circuit
didn't actually get to. It's not clear it was properly
preserved before the D.C. Circuit, because the claim
that some of the rates are not contract rates was
raised only by intervenors.
So while we adhere to our view that these
are contract rates, this Court need not get to it. It
need only address the issue the court addressed below,
which is whether there is a broad-based, third-party
exception to Mobile-Sierra.
And the answer is no. Mobile-Sierra can't
be energy law’s equivalent of the Maginot Line, that it
protects against direct assaults from the contracting
parties themselves but provides no protection, not
whatsoever, if it’s flanked by noncontracting parties to
the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I like that. That's very
imaginative.
(Laughter.)
MR. LAMKEN: I hope you use it. Thank you,
Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the
