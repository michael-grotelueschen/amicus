CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
next this morning in Case 12-929, Atlantic Marine
Construction Company v. The United States District Court
for the Western District of Texas.
Mr. Hastings.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAMS S. HASTINGS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HASTINGS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Forum selection clauses have been frequently
used in contracts of all types.  They should be enforced
as written, and the enforcement of a contractual forum
selection clause should not just be left to convenience
discretionary balancing tests.
Rule 12(b)(3), in Section 1406 of the United
States Code, provide appropriate and effective means for
enforcing a contractual forum selection clause.  The
language of those provisions is written broadly.
Congress used words like "wrong," and the rule uses the
word "improper," which have plain and natural meanings
that are broad and are sufficient to authorize district
courts to act to enforce the contractual clause.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is -- is it common in the
treatises or in the cases to say that a forum selection
clause is a venue provision?  I thought venue was
something that Congress determined.
MR. HASTINGS:  Your Honor, the cases do
discuss it as a venue provision.  One example would be
this Court's decision in Stewart addressed a forum
selection clause in a 1404(a) transfer analysis, which
is clearly a venue analysis.  In addition to that, with
the 2011 amendments to the United States Code, Congress
adopted a definition of venue.  It's in Section 1390.
That definition says the place of litigation.  I'm
paraphrasing it, but it's -- it's a pretty
straightforward definition.
The legislative history of Section 201 of
that Act acknowledges that the definition was intended
to make venue determinations easier and to make it
clearer that parties could waive or adjust these types
of provisions even by contract.  The words "by
contract."
JUSTICE ALITO:  In the Stewart case to which
you just referred, the court said, "The parties do not
dispute that the district court properly denied the
motion to dismiss the case for improper venue under
1406(a)" because Respondent apparently does business in
the Northern District of Alabama, which was not the
jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause.
So what -- if we were to write an opinion in
your favor, what would you suggest we say about that?
MR. HASTINGS:  Your Honor, I believe the
correct reading of that language is what the Second
Circuit has said in the trade comment decision, and
others have written on this, that Stewart and -- and the
text read by that footnote.  That's footnote 8, I
believe.  The text right there said, "The immediate
issue is how we address 1404(a)."
And the way the majority of the circuit
courts have read it is the issue in Stewart, this
procedural issue that we're here on today, which is
simply not presented to the Court.
And so the Court could very easily write a
decision that acknowledges Stewart still controls on a
1404(a) analysis, but acknowledged that, like the majority
of the circuits, that Stewart simply did not have to
address this problem.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's -- that's true,
but it means that the entire discussion in Stewart is
beside the point.  The Court wrote a decision about an
issue that really never should arise because the party
seeking -- as you see it, the party seeking to enforce
the forum selection clause should proceed under 1406.
So Stewart said, well, if -- if you proceed
under the wrong provision, this is how it should come
out.  It makes the whole decision essentially
meaningless, doesn't it?
MR. HASTINGS:  Justice Alito, I respectfully
disagree.  And here's what the meaning of Stewart would
be, as -- as we understand it.  First of all, under the
facts of Stewart, the same situation would arise, of
course, if a party waived their proper venue objection.
That may be a narrow line of cases, but that would still
apply in a case where a party doesn't assert the
contract at first.
But there's another place where Stewart
would still apply, when a case is filed in the proper
jurisdiction.  Here, if this lawsuit had been filed in
Virginia, there would be a very limited place for
exceptional circumstances for a court to look at a
1404(a) analysis and determine if public interest
required something other than the contract clause.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't see how that
would -- I don't see how that would work.  You're --
this is the argument you made in your reply brief, that
if this -- if the case had been filed in the
jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause,
that court could nevertheless proceed under 1404(a) and
transfer it back to the Western District of Texas, for
example.  That's -- that's your argument, right?
MR. HASTINGS:  In exceptional cases, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  In exceptional cases.  But
1404(a) says that it can -- a case can be transferred to
a district where it might have been brought.  And your
argument under 1406 is that they couldn't be brought in
the Western District of Texas, that's a place where
there's a wrong venue.
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Your Honor, the language
of the statutes, particularly, the language you were
just referring to about "might have been brought," needs
to be read in context of decisions from this Court.  In
Van Dusen, this Court held that that language "might
have been brought" was a term of art.
The Court has never reached that conclusion
with respect to wrong or improper.  And in Van Dusen,
the Court said the "might have been brought" language
was a term of art referring back to a congressionally
chosen venue under 1391.
And so, when this plays out under 1404(a),
the court -- if the case is in the proper venue and
we're on to the second issue of 1404(a), the proper
reading of the language would allow the court, truly
in exceptional circumstances, to follow -- follow the
language of the statute and send it to another place
where Congress said the case could have been.
And, again, this is really the second issue
in the case.  We would emphasize that it's truly
exceptional cases where parties had contracted for a
forum, they've truly resolved the conveniences among the
parties among themselves.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hastings, Section 1391
says the following, "Except as otherwise provided by
law" -- not by contract -- "by law, this section shall
govern" -- shall govern -- "the venue of all" -- "all
civil actions brought in district courts of the United
States."  And then it goes on to specify certain rules
for where venue in a case can lie.
So if I'm looking at that, I'm thinking,
well, those rules apply.  And they can't be reversed or
countermanded or whatever by -- by contract, by parties'
agreement, except to the extent that the contract can
figure centrally into the 1404 analysis.  But it's not
appropriate in the 1406 analysis because -- you know,
the statute says what the statute says.  Here is venue.
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Your Honor, the language
of Section 1391, and the first part, I believe it's
1391(a) where it has the language of "shall govern in
federal courts," that's really no different than what
this Court said in Stewart of Federal law controls venue
in Federal courts.
But the issue that comes up is that venue --
venue is very important.  Venue, even before the current
statutes were written, was recognized as being a
privilege for the litigants.  They're to protect the
defendants.  And even in Neirbo, in the 1939, so almost
a decade before the -- some of the current statutes were
written, this Court said venue was subject to
disposition by the parties.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's only -- what that
tells us is that venue is a highly waiverable thing.
You can stand on your venue right, but you don't have
to.
My problem with your interpretation is you
are allowing a private agreement to make a venue
prescription that Congress enacted improper.  Congress
said it was proper.  It may be that it should not apply
in this case because the parties have consented to
something else, but it's not a wrong venue.
I mean, suppose the question had never come
up.  The -- there wasn't a claim that this was a wrong
venue.  The -- the case could have proceeded, and it
would have been a place of proper venue, right?
MR. HASTINGS:  Your Honor, if there was no
objection raised, yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it doesn't become --
it's a place of proper venue.  There may be a reason why
another venue is the one that should control in this
case, but you can't make a private agreement -- can't
say what Congress says is proper is improper.
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Your Honor, in response
to that, first of all, the venue rights have always
been, like many Federal rights, waiverable provisions.
And when a contract --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That doesn't mean it's
improper.  It means it's waiverable.
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Your Honor, the language
of the word "improper," improper is a broad term, and it
has a broad meaning.  I'd like to focus on "improper"
for just a second.  We have two different words,
"improper" and "wrong."  But "improper" is used in
12(b)(3).
Congress didn't -- or -- and the courts did
not explain what that applies.  In practice, that word
is used for many different contexts.  It's used to
enforce forum selection clauses.  The majority of the
circuit courts -- in fact, more circuits than have
weighed in on our favor use that language to enforce
foreign clauses and clauses requiring State court
forums.  It's used in a very broad context in order to
enforce people's contract rights.  It's even used in
arbitration context.
Although the FAA gives parties the right to
move under the FAA, many parties raise their complaints
under the 12(b)(3) because of the procedural impact of
12(b) motions, allowing parties not to have to answer
complicated Federal cases and get to proceed to
arbitration more quickly.
Giving the language a plain and natural
meaning allows the courts to, essentially, do justice
and allow to streamline and have efficient running of
cases and to enforce parties' rights in contracts.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So what --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hastings, I wonder what
you think of this analogy.  Any party can waive a
personal jurisdiction defense, but would you say that
parties by contract can create personal jurisdiction in
a court in which it otherwise doesn't exist?
MR. HASTINGS:  Your Honor, personal
jurisdiction is -- is also essentially a personal right
of the defendant.  And so if the defendant is willing to
consent to personal jurisdiction, as often happens in
contracts --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, as I said, anybody can
waive it.  Just like anybody can waive almost everything
in our -- in -- in the way the Federal rules work.  But
do you think that parties can actually create personal
jurisdiction where it doesn't exist by law?
MR. HASTINGS:  Focusing on personal
jurisdiction, not subject matter jurisdiction, yes,
because parties can consent and contract to waive the
personal jurisdiction objections.  And, Your Honor, I
believe that has been recognized by many of the circuit
courts.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because consent is a
basis for personal jurisdiction.
MR. HASTINGS:  Exactly, Your Honor.  Just
like --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could -- could I ask, what
difference would it make to you if -- if I thought the
venue here is proper, but I thought that there -- there
was no cause of action in this circuit, and the case --
as one of the amicus briefs proposed.  What difference
would that make to you?
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Justice Scalia, that
would -- Professor Sachs' brief certainly makes that
argument.  I would begin by acknowledging that that rule
would be far better than leaving this to discretionary
balancing tests.
What difference it would make, it actually
would be very favorable to my client because this case
would have to be dismissed.  We have concerns about that
rule.  That's why we didn't push that as our argument.
The circuits have a three-way split.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't that -- that's a
problem with the argument.  Both 1404(a) and 1406
provide for transfer.  This Court has emphasized that
it's one Federal system, and within the Federal system,
the result shouldn't be dismissed, bring the case all
over again, pay a new filing fee; instead of that, just
transfer to the appropriate forum.  And that's what
Professor Sachs' view leaves out because the result, as
you say, is -- it's only dismissal, no transfer.
MR. HASTINGS: And Justice Ginsburg,that is one
of the -- one of the concerns with the rule.  But
Professor Sachs' approach does, first of all, start off
with a strong benefit of enforcing contracts.  It's just
not as effective as 12(b)(3), because when we are
dealing with what's really a venue issue --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  But what if
there is no personal jurisdiction, okay, and the -- and
the suit is dismissed because there is no personal
jurisdiction.  Would a Federal court transfer it to --
to another court that has personal jurisdiction?
MR. HASTINGS:  Your Honor, under the current
statutes, I believe the court would have the discretion
to transfer it based upon personal jurisdiction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where -- it's -- 1404(a)
and 1406 deal with venue.  They don't deal with personal
jurisdiction.
MR. HASTINGS:  Your Honor, many -- many
courts have actually read 1406 to also allow for
addressing personal jurisdiction.  There's a circuit
split on that issue.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hastings, has 12(b)(6)
ever been used to your knowledge to deal with a case in
which the question is which court the plaintiff should
have brought the suit in, rather than whether the
plaintiff has a viable claim in any court?
MR. HASTINGS:  Yes --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because it seems to me a bit
of a category error.  The 12(b)(6) is something -- it's
an on-the-merits determination about the viability of
your claim.  It has res judicata effect, whereas this is
not.  This is just a question of, did you bring the
thing in the right place and you should be allowed to
bring it someplace else.
MR. HASTINGS:  Justice Kagan, the First
Circuit has been using the 12(b)(6) approach to address
whether the case is in the right --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I know the courts have been.
I'm saying, except for this kind of case, has a court
ever used 12(b)(6) to deal with a case of which court?
MR. HASTINGS:  Outside of the forum
selection clause context --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Or to deal with anything
that's not an on-the-merits determination that precludes
a case in any court?
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Your Honor, I'm not
aware of a court doing it outside of the context of the
forum selection clause issue, as the First Circuit --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I have one question here.
It seems -- because I start out for reasons I won't go
into thinking, well, perhaps it doesn't matter, frankly;
you can get to the same result under any one of these
three approaches.
But then one thing Professor Sachs says does
bother me, that if we take your approach, then how do we
deal with the problem of removal?  I mean, you can only
remove a case to a court which is in the district where
the person -- the plaintiff filed.  Now, if there is a
forum selection clause, the defendant seems to me to be
stuck, because he can't go to a -- he can't go to a --
to another.
He can't go to another court.  He can't go
to the court within the district because of the forum
selection clause, and he can't go into another court
because of 1441(a).  So that argues to me that we ought
to either take the 1404 approach, or we ought to take
Professor Sachs' approach, unless you have an answer to
that.
MR. HASTINGS:  Justice Breyer, I do have an
answer to the removal issue.  And the answer starts in
Section 1390(c).  And in 1390(c), Congress said --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where can -- where
can I find that?
MR. HASTINGS:  Chief Justice Roberts, it's
28 U.S. Code 1390(c).
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not
conveniently set forth in any of the papers, right?
MR. HASTINGS:  No, Your Honor, it's not.  I
did not know that this issue was going to come up.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Fair enough.
MR. HASTINGS:  With respect to 1390(c),
Congress said --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  1390(c)?
MR. HASTINGS:  Yes, sir.  Yes, Your Honor.
Congress said that these rules, with the
exception of the transfer rules, do not apply in removal
cases.  Congress has answered the question.  Removal
procedure is governed by the statutes on removal, and,
yes, if you are in State court, there is one court you
can remove to.  This rule and this issue doesn't change
that.
But if you -- if this case had been filed in
Texas State court, for example, and was removed to the
Western District, 1390(c) still says that the transfer
rules -- it doesn't say 1404(a); it says the transfer
rules, which would also pick up 1406 -- could still
apply to reallocate the venue for the lawsuit if there
was a contract clause or if it was --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You didn't really
explain -- I'm sorry.  I'll read it more carefully
later.  But how -- it says you have to -- you have to
remove to the court or the district and division where
the place of action is pending, so if it's filed in
State court in Texas, you have to remove to the Texas
Federal court.  Now, how do we get -- and you can't go
to the Texas Federal court, according to you, because of
the contract.
Okay.  Now, how -- now, you explain how --
how this provision over 1390(c) gets around that?
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Justice Breyer, I would
respectfully disagree about whether you can get to the
Texas court.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you -- in other
words, you can remove to the Texas court, even though it
says you can remove -- you can remove to the district
court despite the contract.
MR. HASTINGS:  Yes, Justice Breyer,
because --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Despite the contract.
MR. HASTINGS:  Because of the specific
Federal statutes allowing for removal.  They tell
specifically where the removal must go, and so we're not
suggesting that the court would have to --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So what the court should
say in Texas is, we have a contract which says you have
to go to Virginia, but because of 1390(a) we forget
about the contract and we remove it here.
MR. HASTINGS:  No --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what you're saying
Texas should say.
MR. HASTINGS:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No?
MR. HASTINGS:  What I'm saying is the State
district -- if the parties were in the State district
court and remove it to the Federal district court, under
the statutes, under 1390 -- well, first of all, that
was -- that's what the removal statutes require.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. HASTINGS:  1390(c), which say the
transfer rules still apply, the Texas district court, if
we had our contract, should have said, now that you've
removed this to Federal court, we must transfer this
case to Virginia because the transfer rules still apply.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what about -- suppose
the plaintiff says, Please dismiss this immediately
because of 1406 or -- you know, because 1406 says you
have to dismiss it; venue isn't proper here.
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Your Honor, under that
circumstance, if it was a contract requiring a State
court forum -- I think that's what I understand the
question to be.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  The contract says
you go to Virginia.
MR. HASTINGS:  Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER:  They filed it in Texas
State court.  You tried to remove it to Texas Federal
court.
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And they say, I'm very
sorry.  The contract that he loves says we can't remove
it to Texas Federal court.
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Your Honor, the contract
would not prevent the removal, but once the case was
removed the contract would control where the case --
where the case would be allocated.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can I ask --
JUSTICE ALITO:  May I ask about -- just go
ahead.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  May I?  In a forum non
conveniens motion, I say, oh, the witnesses are some
places, what is the statutory and/or Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure basis for forum non conveniens?
MR. HASTINGS:  Justice Kennedy, that's an
excellent question because the courts, when they usually
rule on forum non conveniens, do not specify that.
There's not a Federal --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You just cite Gulf Oil,
and that's it?
MR. HASTINGS:  In many times, yes, but a lot
of times, parties do go ahead and cite 12(b)(3).  That's
often done by parties in litigation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's if it's -- if it's
a State forum or foreign forum, but 1404(a) is a
codification of the forum non conveniens doctrine?
MR. HASTINGS:  For the Federal courts, yes,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you this about the
Professor Sachs' argument?  Doesn't it lead to the
consequence -- doesn't it show that -- wouldn't it mean
that Justice Scalia's dissent was correct in Stewart and
the majority was wrong in Stewart?
Because if this is -- if this is
contractual -- suppose Ricoh, in that case, had moved --
had adopted -- had taken the approach that Professor
Sachs has recommended and moved for summary judgment – moved to
12(b)(6) or summary judgment; that would be a contract
issue.  It would be governed by Alabama law.  Alabama
law says the forum selection clause is no good.
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Justice Alito, we do
think there is some tension between Professor Sachs'
position and the Stewart decision because, if Professor
Sachs is correct and the First Circuit's correct, there
really would be no room for a 1404 balancing issue.  The
issue, I believe, that you are asking about --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But why is that?  Why
wouldn't 1404(a) continue to apply?
MR. HASTINGS:  Justice Scalia, if the
contract -- if the contract elevated this to an issue on
the merits, is essentially what 12(b)(6) does, then it
becomes an issue not just about venue; it becomes an
issue about merits.  And so a venue allocation provision
wouldn't change the fact that if the case was in the
wrong forum --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If -- but it depends
upon -- upon the defendant.  If he chooses to go the
1404(a) route, he could go that way, couldn't he?
MR. HASTINGS:  Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He wouldn't have to move
under 12(b)(6), would he?
MR. HASTINGS:  He wouldn't have to move
under 12(b)(6), but --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it -- so it wouldn't
necessarily overrule Stewart.
MR. HASTINGS:  But there's a potential
problem here, and this is one of the practical issues
with Professor Sachs' issue -- approach.  If it's an
issue on the merits, it doesn't have to be raised right
at the beginning of the case.
A party could certainly move to transfer and
do a lot of other things, but they could raise that
issue as a defense on the merits of the lawsuit and have
it resolved at trial after the entire proceeding had
proceeded in a forum other than where the contract was
required.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't follow that.  If
it's an affirmative defense, you have to raise it or you
lose it.  You can't hold back an affirmative defense,
and, in the middle of the trial, say, Oh, there's an
affirmative defense here.  (8)(c) requires you to
state it.
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Justice Ginsburg, it
would certainly have to be pleaded.  And certainly,
there is opportunity -- you know, leave is freely
granted in cases unless -- you know, other circumstances
arise.  It's possible to plead it down the line.  But
most importantly, it's when do you get a ruling on that
issue?  And that's the problem.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what is the problem
with this?  You admit that if he goes to Virginia --
well, he files his suit in Virginia.  All right.  Then
he says, judge, everything's in Texas, please remove
under 1404(a) -- you know, go -- send it down to Texas.
And you agree that -- that in an unusual case, you say,
because you give a lot of weight to the contract, he
could win and go to Texas, right?
MR. HASTINGS:  That's our position, yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's your position, fine.
If that's your position, what conceivable difference
does it make if he goes to Texas in the first place, and
then you say, remove it to Virginia?  I mean, it should
work out the same way.  It should work out that the
balancing under 1404 -- you know, it gives you the --
the factors should be the same, shouldn't they?
MR. HASTINGS:  Your Honor, the way this
would work out is if -- focusing on the 1404(a) issue,
the real issue gets down to where does the lawsuit need
to be filed, what rules are going to be in place, and if
a party can just file in Texas because they want -- they
want to try to move it there for convenience, they can
just file in Texas, what they're doing is they're
requiring a party who just wants to live --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's a terrible thing.  You
have to say 1404(a), and the other case he has to say
1404(a) and it -- I mean, maybe it makes some tremendous
practical difference.
But if it makes not much difference, I have
three routes that seem to me all should work out the
same way, and in favor of their route is the absolute
language that Justice Kagan pointed out before, plus the
footnote.  Okay?
So I'm thinking, hey, this doesn't make --
it's important to have a rule.  It's important to have
one clear approach.  But as between the three, it
shouldn't matter, and they should all reach the same
conclusions.  So let's go with the language of Stewart.
All right.  What about -- now, what's the answer to
that?
MR. HASTINGS:  Justice Breyer, first of all,
I would agree with you that under this case, all three
routes should have lead -- led to the exact same
conclusion.  That's -- that is correct under this case,
but that may not be in all cases.  Why it matters is
that parties should be forced to honor their contracts.
And so if a party honors its contract and
there's a very high standard, such as the exceptional
circumstances standard for receiving a transfer,
their -- parties who are following their contract, it's
unlikely you're going to have much litigation over
transfers.
Whereas if a party can say I can try my shot
at a home court forum, file in violation of the contract
and then make the other party raise this issue and have
to litigate venue, we're going to have a tremendous
litigation about venue.  That's the problem.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The law travels with --
the law of the transferring State travels to the
transferred State.  So they've undone -- they're taking
Texas law, if you go under 1404, to Virginia.
MR. HASTINGS:  And that would be a problem
in many cases, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that would defeat
the purpose of the venue selection to start with.
That's part of your argument?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That would be taken care
of simply by saying Van Dusen v. Barrack does not apply
when a party is acting in violation of a contractual
provision.  Van Dusen against Barrack was intended to
give the plaintiff plaintiff's choice of initial forum.
If plaintiff chooses a forum in violation of the
contract, there's no reason why Van Dusen should apply.
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Justice Ginsburg,
that -- that points out that if the Court were to not
just strictly enforce the contracts, it raises many new
issues that this Court has not yet had to address.
I’d like to reserve my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Allensworth?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. ALLENSWORTH
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it
please the Court:
We brought this $160,000 construction case
in the Western District of Texas, which is where we
performed our work, where the project's located, where
all the witnesses reside, and where virtually all of the
evidence is located.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Allensworth, where
you agreed not to bring it.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I'm going back to what
Justice Breyer says.  Let's suppose you're right about
1404, and I think you have some pretty good arguments.
1404, it seems to me, shouldn't affect this case in the
sense that you should have -- this was a negotiated
contract.
You got something for the fact that you
accepted inconvenience when you brought a suit.  And
under 1404, the court is perfectly entitled -- the court
has to take that into account, that this was a
negotiated contract, that you accepted in convenience,
and that you got something for your -- for your
acceptance of inconvenience.  The end.  You have to live
with your contract.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  No, Your Honor.  We have a
contract, and we are having to live with it in the sense
that we're up here now 15 months after the district
court ruled that we were supposed to -- we should --
15 months after the district court denied the motion to
transfer.
What we -- and we did -- and those are
indeed the terms of our contract.  However, the -- we
felt that any court following Stewart, and 1404 would
weigh the interests of justice in the decision whether
to grant the transfer or not, and indeed, that's exactly
what the district court found.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the interests -- the
interests of justice that the district court weighed
almost all boiled down to the interests of your client,
the inconvenience of witnesses.  Well, Atlantic Marine,
to the extent we're talking about their witnesses,
they're not concerned about the inconvenience of having
their witnesses go to -- to Norfolk, but your
witnesses -- the other witnesses are your witnesses.  So
that's a factor that goes to your convenience.
Compulsory process to produce witnesses, same thing.
So what were the public interests that --
what were the interests that were weighed here that are
not the interests of J-Crew?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  If I might, Your Honor,
first off, the district court didn't give any shrift to
our witness.  He was concerned with the nonparty
witnesses who were not a party to this --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if they're not your
witnesses, then they're -- they're Atlantic Marine's
witnesses.  So why should that be -- why should the
inconvenience of Atlantic Marine's witnesses be a factor
that weighs against Atlantic Marine's position that the
case should be tried in Norfolk?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  They were neither Atlantic
Marine's witnesses, nor our witnesses.  They were
nonparty witnesses, and the issue that Judge
Higginbotham addressed in the Fifth Circuit --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just volunteer witnesses?
Are they just going to walk in the courtroom and say,
I'd -- I'd like to testify?
(Laughter.)
MR. ALLENSWORTH:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
or the other's, aren't they?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
Exactly.
Surely, they're one side's
Your Honor --
What kind of -- what kind
of proceedings do they have in there?
(Laughter.)
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Your Honor, our point is
that, if it's in Texas, they can get in their pickup and
drive to the courthouse and testify.  And if this case
is moved to Virginia, those witnesses essentially are
unavailable to us.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Who -- who is going to call
these witnesses, you or Atlantic Marine?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  We'd be the ones calling
them.
JUSTICE ALITO:  You do, so they're your
witnesses.  The fact that they don't work for you is --
is immaterial here.  So let's say they're out of the
picture.  Now, what else -- what's left?  What other
public interests are involved?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  The law of Texas, which we
think applies to this case, with which the district
court --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is -- Texas contract law is
so arcane that the judges in the Eastern District of
Virginia can't figure it out?  Is that right?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  I wouldn't suggest that,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Oh, okay.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So why -- why
then couldn't you go to Virginia with all these factors?
I mean, maybe the jury has to take 42 visits to the
bottom of an oil well shaft.  I don't know.  I mean,
there could be something that would weigh in your favor.
I don't know the case.  So why not go to Virginia and
then file a 1404 motion?
And it should reach the same result, whether
you -- you go to Texas and ask to stay there or whether
you go to Virginia under 1404(a) -- you win this case,
let's say -- or whether you go to Virginia.  It should
get to the same place, shouldn't it?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Your Honor, in some ways,
that's exactly what we're worried about.  The same place
is 15 months after the court's ruled on the transfer
motion.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So it's actually your
expense because you would have to go to Virginia and you
would have to file the motion.  Maybe you can do it by
mail or you'd have to -- but I don't know.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  We filed a motion.  If we
filed -- if we filed this lawsuit in Virginia and filed
it simultaneously with a 1404 motion --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  -- by their lights --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  -- the court, as I think
one of the Justices pointed out, couldn't transfer it
back to Texas anyway because, by their lights, venue is
improper anywhere except Virginia.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  They are not
saying -- they said that you could make the 1404 motion
in Virginia, and they think it would only be granted in
an exceptional case, but that's their opinion in that,
and so it should come to the same conclusion.  They
aren't barring you from that on their view.
But my thought is that, if all these come to
the same result in the end and you just need one ruling,
we have something pointing on their side -- your side,
which is the Stewart footnote and the language of the --
you know, the absolute language of the venue statutes,
and you have something pointing in their side, which is,
if we count by numbers, five circuits are in their favor
and only three in yours.
All right.  Help me.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  If there wasn't -- if
there hadn't been a forum selection clause in the
contract and we'd filed suit in Texas, it's
inconceivable that they could -- they could have
successfully moved the case to Virginia.  The only thing
going in favor of this case going to Virginia is that
forum selection clause.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's kind of
a big thing, isn't it?  I mean, that's what the whole --
(Laughter.)
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  It's a significant factor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's a significant
factor.  And -- and the problem, the difference, all
things don't lead to the same place.  1404 says to the
district court, look at a hodge-podge of things,
including the interest of justice, and -- and figure it
out and -- you know, maybe they will give the contract
some weight or maybe they won't, and if they do, it's
not clear how you weigh the contract against the
interest of justice.  It gives a broad discretion.  It
says they may transfer.
1406 is an entirely different animal.  It
says you shall dismiss or -- or transfer.  It's sort of
a -- you know, you have the safety valve to transfer,
and I don't know why you -- you so cavalierly dismiss,
oh, it's in the contract, of course, but we've got more
witnesses.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  It is in the -- Your
Honor, it is in the contract.  Because it's in the
contract, we didn't get the deference that otherwise
plaintiff would get on selection of venue.  We had --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that couldn't
have come as a surprise.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  No, sir.  And we
haven't -- we haven't attacked the clause on Bremen
standards.  We haven't claimed it was induced by fraud
or that it was overreaching.  We accept that.  The
question that we've got is whether the -- whether the
Federal judiciary has to accept that contract clause as
guiding their decision --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it does in this way.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if 1404 -- if the
court --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It does in this way.  1404,
as Justice Ginsburg said, is a codification of forum non
conveniens law, which is a balancing of private and
public interests.  It seems to me what Justice Alito
said was absolutely right.  You have given up the
ability to claim private interests here by virtue of
your choice to sign that contract.
The only thing that could weigh in the
balance against that is if there is some -- something
that has nothing to do with your convenience, but is
instead a feature of -- of -- something about why it's
important to the judicial system, to the public
interest, about keeping the trial in one place.
And as Justice Alito suggested, you have not
been able to point to anything, nor would there be
anything to point to, in most cases involving forum
selection clauses.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  In most cases, there
wouldn't be, and that's why in most cases the clauses
are enforced, and that's why I don't think you have seen
one of these for 25 years.
The reason that we've got -- that we think
our case is somewhat unique is that it involves a
construction project in the district in which we filed
suit.  All of the witnesses are there.  Virtually all of
the physical evidence is there.  It's subject, if we
stay in Texas, to Texas law.
And for those reasons, if the case is going
to get sent to Virginia, the systemic integrity of the
system, I think, is put in play.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but the reason
for these clauses -- the enforceability of these clauses
is critically important to a lot of modern commerce.
If you -- I don't know what the details are
here, but a lot of times your company -- and they are
doing business now all across the country, and you say,
I don't want to do business all across the country if
I'm going to get dragged into different courts, who
knows where, with different -- where the juries are
different, I want to do business around the country, so
long as, if I am going to be sued, it's right here.  So
I'm only going to do business with people who are
willing to say, if I have a problem, I will sue you
right here.
That's -- that's critically important to
modern -- modern commerce.  And the idea, well, you're
going to let a court say, well, but there are a few more
witnesses here -- you know, it's convenient to them and
all that, that -- that seems to be throwing a
significant wrench into the process.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Your Honor, I -- I don't
view it as a wrench, as opposed to an opportunity or
mandate from Congress to the -- to the Federal courts to
exercise some discretion in deciding whether to enforce
these clauses or not.  Stewart v. Ricoh --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But your -- your
adversary is not taking that discretion away.  It's
saying -- your adversary, I understand, is conceding
that Virginia has the ability to apply 1404 in it's
judgment, but you should honor the contract.
I have one fundamental problem, which is
slightly different.  Under Bremen and Carnival, if the
forum selected was arbitration or a State court, then
the court has no 1404 power.  It must transfer to those
venues.
If we accept 1404 as applying, then we're
disfavoring commercial parties from picking Federal
courts because they're going to have to accept that a
non-selected venue will have the power to make the
decision whether to transfer or not.
That seems to me to invite -- there may be
people who think that's a good thing, get cases out of
the Federal court, even if they are international
commercial cases.  But isn't that what you are inviting?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Your Honor, I would say
that's a possibility.  I would say that, on the other
hand, that the arbitration example that you brought up,
that is governed by a separate statute anyway.  So
the -- the Federal Arbitration Act is going to govern
whether that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well --
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  -- whether the arbitration
clause ought to be enforced or not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- the clause here
allowed suit in -- in State or Federal court.  Suppose
the clause -- the forum selection clause had just said "all
disputes shall be litigated in the Circuit Court for the
City of Norfolk."  It doesn't say anything about the
Eastern District of Virginia.
then?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:
dismiss our case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:
MR. ALLENSWORTH:
What would be the result
The Court would have to
And equally --
Because he couldn't -- he
couldn't transfer it to -- he can't force that into a
Virginia circuit.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the same thing if --
if the choice was of an arbitral forum, then you
recognize in those two cases the result would have to be
dismissal?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And what would be the
authority for dismissing the case if it had specified
the State court?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  I think it would be the
same one as in Bremen, which didn't -- in The Bremen,
which didn't mention court --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  Bremen is an admiralty
case.  Why won't it just be a forum non conveniens?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  It -- it would be, and --
I've forgotten which Justice raised the question about
this.  1404(a) is a codification of forum non
conveniens.  In the absence of that, the case would just
be dismissed.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  I mean, 1404, it
says that if it's says -- if the contract clause
specifies a Federal court, it's a 1404 motion.  If it
specifies a State court, it's a forum non conveniens
motion.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  With the same result -- I
would say the same result.  Dismissal would be --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That argues, then, it might
be slightly against you.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE BREYER:  The -- if, in fact, you
specify a State court, if, in fact, you specify a
foreign court, if, in fact, you specify arbitration, you
agree, in those instances, you are going to use forum
non conveniens or you are going to use 1406.  But you
are saying where you specify a court in a different
State, namely a Federal court in a different State,
there you use 1404.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it's not 1406.  It's
just forum non conveniens, which is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, it was forum non
conveniens.  Oh, you use forum non conveniens in all
three?  You don't use -- I mean, they specify a State
court?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Because the 1406 wouldn't
apply because the -- because --
JUSTICE BREYER:  They say venue is a State
court --
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  No, sir.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- use forum non conveniens
in all those?
Okay.  Use forum non conveniens in all
those, but you use 1404 if they specify another Federal
court.  That's what -- that's what -- that's what
you're --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You use 12(b)(3), not
1404.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In those other cases,
you --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You use 12(b)(3), okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- you use 12(b)(3).
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Yes.  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But my point is you're
using something else, so they would say, well, let's
have it the same -- you know -- okay.  I see the answer.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Forget it.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  No, but that raises a
larger question, and if I could -- if I could address for
just a second -- and that's the systemic integrity of
the -- of the system.
If you are going to transfer a case to --
within the system to another Federal court that's going
to have to hear the case, one like this one where he is
likely going to have to hear it without witnesses or
certainly without live witnesses, and to render a
judgment based on facts that were developed 1,500 miles
away on a project that is that far away, that does
implicate, I think, the integrity of the system and
that, ultimately, a Federal judge is the one that's
going to have to write and take it up in judgment, if I
can't scare up the witnesses to be in Virginia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't -- don't put me in
the group that thinks you can use forum non conveniens.
When -- when you have a forum selection clause for a
State court and suit is brought -- attempted to be
brought in a Federal court -- I mean, if it's in the
Federal court, that is the most convenient court -- I
mean, let's say it's in -- in a different State where
all the witnesses are.
I think it's very strange to say that,
because there is a contract provision requiring it to be
brought in a State court, this court is an inconvenient
court.  I -- do you know that the doctrine of forum non
conveniens has ever been used that way.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  No, sir.  No, Your Honor,
I don't.  I don't.  And to confess I haven't thought
through the -- the question that you just said.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you know the answer --
this is another -- I keep thinking they should all come
to the same conclusion.  But, then, what about this
point Justice Sotomayor raised?  Suppose you sue in
Texas -- you know, you get there, but the contract,
let's say, was a different contract from yours, but it
just was made in Nevada.  Everything about this concerns
Nevada.  Are they really going to use Texas law to
interpret the contract rather than Nevada's?
I would have thought that the choice of law
question is a different question, and where you sue
should be irrelevant to the choice of law question
except insofar -- I don't know.  Maybe you looked --
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Van Dusen said that the
law moves with the -- with the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Only because the
plaintiff -- the plaintiff's choice of forum was to be
respected.  But if the plaintiff chooses a forum in
violation of the contract, the whole rationale of that
case falls.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It was to honor the
plaintiff's choice of forum.  Well, the contract says
the plaintiff doesn't have a choice.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Your Honor, the contract
as Judge Higginbotham pointed out doesn't have a
selection of law -- law clause.  They put -- it's got
every other dispute resolution clause that could be in
there to make it difficult for us to get this case to a
court, but it doesn't have a -- it doesn't have a choice
of law provision in it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the only reason that
Van Dusen came out the way it did was -- I think it was
that Justice Black said the plaintiff's choice of forum
merits respect.  It doesn't merit respect when the
plaintiff has agreed that the suit will go forward
someplace else.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  I don't recall.  Sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In other words, that
issue has not been decided by them.
JUSTICE ALITO:  If 1404 is the correct
procedural route, why shouldn't the rule be something
like this, where there is a forum selection clause, the
burden is on -- the burden of trying to establish venue
in some other jurisdiction is on the party opposing the
forum selection clause, not the party that's invoking
the forum selection clause.
And the only factors that can be considered
against the forum selection clause to -- to result in an
exceptional case where that wouldn't be honored are
factors that have nothing to do with the convenience of
the -- of the party that doesn't want it tried in -- in
the selected forum or with the likelihood of success of
the party that doesn't want it tried in the -- in
the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection
clause.
So in your case, if there had been a
hurricane that wiped out the courts of the Eastern
District of Virginia for some period of time so no cases
could be tried, or there was an incredible backload of
cases there that would prevent the case from being
tried, maybe that would be -- those would be something
that might amount to an exceptional circumstance, but
everything else is off the board.
What's wrong with that?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  First off, on the validity
of the clause, we acknowledge we'd have the burden. If we
were trying to avoid this clause on the ground, on
whatever grounds, or under any Bremen grounds or we’d gotten
cheated into it or anything like that.  We'd have the
burden on that.  We didn't try to carry that burden.
We're not attacking the clause.  They have the burden on
the main case -- on the transfer itself.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why should that -- why
should that be, where there's a forum selection clause?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  I don't think that it's
even a matter, really, so much of burden as it is of
weight, and you all have already spoken on that where
you said that it's -- that clause is to get
significant -- significant weight.  It ought to be
central to the analysis, but it's not dispositive.
And our -- our contention was that the
clause was not dispositive, but that every -- every
factor that possibly could go -- militate against
transferring this case to Virginia existed, and that's
why the court, giving appropriate deference to the
clause, to that clause, hearing what the evidence was
and deciding as you --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It should have been a
Virginia court to make that decision, instead of your
friendly, down home Texas court.  And that's -- you
know, that was why the forum selection clause was put in
there.  It doesn't seem to me such a stretch as you
think it is to say that the venue is improper when you
have agreed that venue would not lie in this court.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  We can't confer venue.  We
can -- we can waive venue, but we can't make improper
venue --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the -- the question is:
Is it improper when it's been waived?  Is it improper
for a court to acknowledge venue when the party has --
has said I -- I cannot -- I cannot bring my suit in this
court.  I don't think it's a terrible stretch to -- to
call that improper venue.
However theoretical it may be, venue is --
is decided by -- by statute, of course it is.  But
people may waive it, and when people have waived it, I
don't know that there's a great interest in -- in saying
that, nonetheless, the venue remains proper.
It seems to me you've given it away, and it
ought to be -- it ought to be the -- the court where the
parties agree that suit would lie that would decide
these -- these change-of-venue questions.
The provision need not be absolutely
dispositive, but to the extent it isn't, that is a call
that -- that ought to be made by the jurisdiction that
the parties agreed to.  The whole litigation ought to
begin there.  They shouldn't have to litigate this
change of venue provision in a court where the parties
agreed they would not appear.
It seems to me terribly unfair.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  There's a couple of
factors on that, Your Honor.  First off, the rule that I
think my colleagues here are calling for effectively
emasculates 1404 and takes the Federal judiciary out of
it.  The question -- and I follow your question about
the propriety of the venue.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is that?  Why is that?
Why can't the Court, where you agreed to be sued, apply
1404?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Another reason for that is
that our contract has a one-way arbitration clause in it
which they -- which the Petitioner claims not to have
waived.  If this case is decided -- it goes to
Virginia -- if we filed the case in Virginia and they
immediately demanded arbitration, the case would be
arbitrated.
But under the FAA, it would be sent to an --
it'd be -- the court in Virginia would appoint an
arbitrator in -- presumably, in Virginia.  And under the
FAA, we don't even necessarily even have the right to
take depositions to provide -- to move to get the
evidence before the court even in deposition form.
We'd rather have the case decided in Texas
on $160,000 case, and I know that's a pittance.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  Are you
saying that, by filing in Texas, you're not going to
arbitration?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  No.  If we go to
arbitration, we go to arbitration in Texas.  We don't
have any complaint about that.  What we don't want to do
is to go to arbitration in Virginia, which it has
not had -- and in this contract, for everything it's got
in it, it doesn't have a clause that says that
arbitration would be conducted in -- there's not a
choice of forum clause for the arbitration.  There is
for litigation, but not for arbitration.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's more favorable
about Texas other than your convenience?  What's more
favorable about arbitration in Texas other than your
convenience?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  That's my --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the only thing.
It's convenient for you to be in Texas.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  It's convenient for us.
The arbitrator can drive out to the project and draw his
own conclusions about what -- about how the thing is
built.  He can talk to the witnesses who are within his
subpoena power or the subpoena power of our District
Court in Texas to show up.  Yes, sir.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Are -- are you finished?
All right.  I'd just like, if you'd want, to
give you a chance to take what I've -- I think Professor
Sachs says, look, there is a way which you can both
follow the statutes literally and say, well, venue is
here, and also get the place to the right forum
respecting the contract.
Just say it is an affirmative defense, which
Justice Ginsburg says the First Circuits follow this
approach.  You put it in the complaint.  The answer, and
once it's in the answer, the judge can put it front and
center.  Indeed, in case he forgets to do that, the
defendant will remind him and say, you've got to get it
to the right court, and let's decide this affirmative
defense thing first.
And -- and now, we're back in the same
place.  What do you think of that?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  I think that that's going
to unnecessarily complicate this.  It gets in -- it
raises some difficult to hearing questions about
which -- difficult hearing questions which the Court, I
think, successfully avoided in -- with its decision in
Stewart.
I don't think that -- that 12(b) motions are
particularly appropriate places to decide these contract
issues.  And it eliminates the 1404 gatekeeper role that
the district court otherwise could be providing and was
providing.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Professor Sachs says that,
in the case of any disputed facts on a 12(b)(6), you
would have to have a trial.  Do you agree with that?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  Yes, Your Honor, and I
think that he under -- underestimates the ability for
resolute counsel to raise disputed facts that would
otherwise prevent the summary judgment practice that he
suggested --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what facts
are -- what facts are -- in the normal case, what facts
are going to be pertinent?  I mean, you've got the
contract there.  I mean, I suppose you can always say,
we entered under duress and all that, but that wouldn't
seem to me to be typical in the normal commercial case
in which these provisions are critically important.
What facts are going to be there?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  I think there might be a
question of materiality.  There might be a question --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what type --
what type of materiality?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  How material that clause
was to the parties' contract or whether you were going
to try to have separability  and focus exclusively on
that clause.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the venue
provision -- I mean, if they go to the trouble of
putting a venue selection -- forum selection provision
in, I would say it seems pretty material.
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  It might or might not,
depending on whichever State law applies to -- and
what -- because that would be under State law to decide
on the materiality, what the effect of the prior breach
is.
We -- this case has been cast in Manichean
terms about our breach of the contract by failing to
file suit in Virginia.  The only written -- the only
handwritten clause in this entire contract, which is in
the appendix, I think, at Page 16, is the one that says
what the price is.
What brings us here to the Federal system is
not for a declaratory relief or to make new law on
venue; it's to collect $160,000.  That clause, I think,
ultimately would be weighed -- might be weighed depending
on the Court, if it -- if the case was being decided on
purely contract grounds--
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So they would be -- the
only people collecting that $160,000 are going to be the
lawyers.
(Laughter.)
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  I -- I wish.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You took a contingency
case in a contract matter?
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  And the other thing, as
Professor Sachs points out --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wish.
(Laughter.)
MR. ALLENSWORTH:  The -- as he points out,
and Justice Haynes -- Judge Haynes did in the Fifth
Circuit, whether they can file suit for us for breach of
contract and the expense that we’ve put them to.  Yes, I
think -- I think they probably could.  We at least get
$160,000 head start on that, and they can bring that as
an offset to our claim if they want to.
We disagree with the question of whether it
would cost them any more to litigate in Texas than it
would in Virginia anyway.  They're going to have to hire
a law firm.  If we litigate in Virginia, they are going
to have to send a lot of -- batch of lawyers back to
Texas to defend the depositions that we'd ask to be
taken there.
I don't know that this case costs any more
to be litigated in Texas where the witnesses are
available and where they might not have to be deposed
than in Virginia where they have to -- where they have
to ship them across the country.
If there is no further questions, thank you,
Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Hastings, you have four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. HASTINGS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HASTINGS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I have just a few brief comments.
First, the parties bargained for the right
result, and they bargained and reached a contract that
should settle the issue of convenience and where this
case should be litigated.  Stewart has an important
observation that I think needs to be emphasized.  Even
under a 1404(a) analysis, the majority in Stewart said
The Bremen is still instructive.  And if it's
instructive on anything, on any rules enforcing a
contract, it should be instructive at this level.
The burden should be on the party trying to
get out from their contract.  The Fifth Circuit
misallocated the burden.  The burden should also be a
high one.  It really should require exceptional
circumstances or perhaps even more, and it should not be
a case where a party can avoid its contract based upon
inconveniences that were foreseeable at the time of
contracting.
For example, the fact that J-Crew hired
Texans to work on its project, it knew what the project
was about and what it would need to do, and it should
not be able to rely upon hiring Texans to change the
deal it negotiated with my client.
There needs to be a clear rule that allows
the courts to hopefully answer the questions about
contracts and venue, so we all can stop litigating these
issues and know the right answers and avoid inundating
the courts with motions to transfer for parties wanting
to renegotiate contracts.
Since the Third Circuit and Sixth Circuit
and, now, the Fifth Circuit have adopted the minority
position, there has been a proliferation of litigation
when a contract already answered the question.  We cited
many cases in our cert petition in a footnote, and I
know there's been many more since then.  And those are
the ones that you can find published.  That doesn't even
mention the ones that are unpublished.  And so a clear
rule needs to be in place to avoid these problems.
Justice Kagan, you raised the issue of forum
non conveniens as perhaps the answer as to what would
happen for a State or foreign contract clause.  I wanted
to briefly touch on that because I don't believe that's
the right answer.
The Bremen looked at a case that came up as
a forum non conveniens case and said, we are not going
to use the forum non conveniens test for enforcing a
contract requiring litigation in an international forum.
They resoundingly rejected the forum non conveniens
approach, and I believe the circuit courts have read
Bremen as rejecting that approach.
If that were going to be the approach to
answer the problem created by the Fifth Circuit for
foreign and State courts, what we would end up with is a
new common law approach, whether called forum non
conveniens or called something else, that looks like
nothing like forum non conveniens and probably a whole
new line of litigation over how that's --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think you mistook my point
at least.  Maybe I didn't express it clearly.  Bremen
comes up on a forum non conveniens motion, and the Court
says, yes, the contract controls, quite properly so.
So -- you know, the fact that it comes up on
a forum non conveniens motion has nothing to do with the
question of whether the contract controls where, people have
negotiated for a certain set of things and there is no
exceptional public interest otherwise.
MR. HASTINGS:  And, Justice Kagan, following
Bremen, the lower courts have recognized that what
essentially Bremen is doing is saying forum non
conveniens is not the right approach, and so instead of
a common law vehicle to answer this issue, we submit
that the right answer is right there in the rules
already.
It's 12(b)(3) is the best answer.  Section
1406 allows the Court also to address this issue.
Honestly, Section -- Rule 12(b)(6) in Professor Sachs'
approach is much better than leaving these issues to
balancing tests.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask you one last
question about 12(b)(6)?
MR. HASTINGS:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Which is -- you know, when
1404 is -- suppose a State which does not recognize
these clauses, 1404 trumps that according to Stewart.
But if you were under 12(b)(6), you would have to go to
what Justice Scalia does in the Stewart dissent.  I
think you would have to go to a twin aims of Erie
analysis.
And in that circumstance, it seems to me
that the State law would come out the victor; isn't that
right?
MR. HASTINGS:  Justice Kagan, the only way I
know how to answer that question is I do not know how
the Professor Sachs approach can actually be reconciled
with Stewart.  There is significant tensions in how that
plays out as an issue that I do not know how it plays
out, but I suspect it would result in lots of
litigation --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If it's under 12(b)(3),
then Stewart stays, and it's Federal law that controls
and the judge decides, right?
MR. HASTINGS:  Yes, Your Honor, and that's
why we are asking this Court to follow the majority
approach on this issue.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Counsel.
The case is submitted.
