CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first today in Davis v. Washington.
Mr. Fisher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Michelle McCottry's statements here were
testimonial for the simple reason that she knowingly
told a governmental agent associated with law
enforcement that someone had committed a crime.
Prosecutions based on such ex parte statements in place
of live testimony strike at the very heart of the evil
the Confrontation Clause is designed to prevent:
trials on the basis of out-of-court accusations.
Indeed, the trial here really can't be
described as anything other than inquisitorial in
nature. The sole proof that Mr. Davis was at Ms.
McCottry's house and assaulted her that day was the 4-
minute, tape-recorded 911 police incident interview
that the State played at Mr. Davis' trial and that it
itself described as Ms. McCottry's testimony on the day
this happened.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Counsel, when you say --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: How does the fact that it's
sole proof mean that it's testimonial?
MR. FISHER: It --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- it -- it adds to the
general appeal of your case I -- I suppose, but what
does that have to do with whether or not it's
testimonial?
MR. FISHER: It doesn't -- it doesn't answer
one way or another whether it's testimonial. What it
does and what I'm trying to do for this Court is,
first, draw back the lens for a moment and look at the
kind of trial that we end up with when statements of
the -- like fresh accusations in this case, are able to
be used in place of live testimony.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did use the word
inquisitorial, and there's one large difference, it
seems. This is not a magistrate judge or a police
officer coming to a person for an interview. This is
initiated by the caller, by the victim, and it's
initially a cry for help.
MR. FISHER: Let -- let me address that
question in two parts. The first part you've
mentioned, Justice Ginsburg, is whether it matters that
the -- that the operator is not a police officer, and
we submit no.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I didn't say that.
MR. FISHER: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I said that the call was
initiated by the victim. It wasn't a -- a police
officer coming to interview her.
MR. FISHER: I see. Well, we don't believe,
under the proper conception of the Confrontation
Clause, it matters who the accusatory statement is
initiated by. Certainly we believe the Confrontation
Clause should apply if Ms. McCottry had simply walked
out of her house and walked down the street to the
police station and voluntarily walked into the
sheriff's office and said, I want to report what Mr.
Davis just did. What we -- what we suggest here today
is there's no difference if she simply calls on the
telephone to a 911 operator, which the State itself in
its brief calls a conduit to the police, and so when
the -- when the police and when the State have set up a
system for people to report calls more expeditiously --
I'm sorry -- report crimes more expeditiously, we don't
think the answer is any different.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're splitting up two
things that I think go together. That is, this is not
just a call. This is a cry for help.
MR. FISHER: Well, there -- in -- in a sense,
of course, Ms. McCottry is seeking help at the same
time she's reporting a crime, but the -- the mere fact
that the two are intertwined does not take us outside
the Confrontation Clause. Of course, in the Indiana
case that you're going to hear, you're going to hear
the same thing, that the person is asking for help in
the same way. So when somebody makes a call, which we
might call a mixed motive or a dual purpose call, the
question that we think this Court should ask is whether
-- whether that's the kind of a statement, first of
all, that historically would have been viewed as
implicating the Confrontation Clause. And if you look
at the hue -- the old hue and cry practice that we've
referred to in our briefs, Sir Matthew Hale in his
treatise explains that when somebody went and got the
local constable, what they were doing is they were
seeking help, first and foremost, to apprehend a felon,
and more than that, they were also reporting the crime
in the first instance.
JUSTICE ALITO: Is it your argument that any
statement made to law enforcement is testimonial?
MR. FISHER: Well, you certainly don't have
to go that far in this case, Your Honor, but -- but we
believe --
--
JUSTICE ALITO: I thought that's what you
said in your argument when you started off.
MR. FISHER: Certainly any statement
describing criminal activity to a law enforcement
officer would be testimonial.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you started out by
saying that the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was
to keep out the accusations made out of court, but I
would have thought that was the purpose of the hearsay
rule. And if that's the purpose of the hearsay rule,
how does the Confrontation Clause differ?
MR. FISHER: The purpose of the hearsay rule,
Justice Breyer, is to police the reliability of out-of-
court statements. What this Court said in Crawford is
the Confrontation Clause is something much different.
It regulates the manner of taking testimony in criminal
trials.
JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, so it's not the purpose
of the Confrontation Clause to keep out out-of-court
accusations. Only some, and which, and what's the
rule?
MR. FISHER: Well, we believe the rule is, is
that any accusatory statement to a law enforcement
officer or to an agent of the law -- of law enforcement
JUSTICE BREYER: I know you do believe that,
but I want to know why in terms of the purposes of not
the hearsay --
MR. FISHER: Well, the --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- rather the confrontation.
MR. FISHER: -- the history of the
confrontation right, going back even prior to the
framer, was to bring the accuser and the accused face
to face so that the accuser made his or her accusation
in the presence of the accused and subject to cross
examination. And the very heart of the Confrontation
Clause, which this Court has said itself over and over
again is to require the accuser to -- to deliver the
accusation in court, and so accusatory statements,
those that say he did it, this is what happened, this
is what I saw, are different than ordinary hearsay.
And -- and I -- to take an example from -- that we
talked about in the Crawford argument, Justice Breyer,
when somebody says pass the -- pass the pewter urn from
the mantle, that's where Bob keeps the drugs, that's
the kind of a statement that is very different than
pointing the finger at somebody to a law enforcement
agent.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I point the finger
in an affidavit, and I just send the affidavit, you
know. I -- I don't want to get involved. I'm in a
foreign country. I sign my name. I even do it under
oath, and I send it right to the judge that's trying
the case, not to a law enforcement officer, to the
judge. You don't think the Confrontation Clause would
cover that?
MR. FISHER: Absolutely, Justice Scalia, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So your -- your thesis that
it applies to just accusatory statements to a law
enforcement officer has to be expanded a little.
MR. FISHER: It does, and what I'm giving you
is a -- a rule that I think is the kernel, the heart of
the confrontation right. You don't have to say much
more than that if it's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about --
what if you -- what if somebody runs out of the -- the
house? There are two people standing in the yard, a
law enforcement officer and the next-door neighbor.
She yells at the next-door neighbor, he's trying to
kill me, and then he comes out. Is that covered by
your rule? It's not to a law enforcement officer.
It's to the next-door neighbor, but the law enforcement
officer overhears it.
MR. FISHER: I think statements that law
enforcement officer merely overhear may not be
testimonial, and one of the reasons for that is this
Court's Bourjaily decision, which it cited with
approval in Crawford, is if somebody make -- if
somebody makes statements that tend out -- that turn
out to be incriminating in a criminal case, the mere
fact that they're overheard by law enforcement officers
or even an undercover officer eliciting the statement
is in a different scenario, Mr. Chief Justice, than
somebody making a statement to law enforcement or even
-- and I want to make sure I understand your
hypothetical. If the person realized that a police
officer was standing there and hearing what she was
telling her neighbor, we may then have a testimonial
situation.
But in this case what we have is not simply a
blurting out or a cry for help. In fact, Ms. McCottry
never asked for help. She said she didn't need an aid
car. What we have are a series of 26 questions that
the 911 operator asked Ms. McCottry that established
every element of the crime the court -- I'm sorry --
that the State ultimately proved.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What was she calling 911 for
if she didn't want help?
MR. FISHER: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, she -- she wanted
something from 911. What did she -- what did she want?
Did she want the police to come over and arrest her
husband? Was that -- or --
MR. FISHER: I think that's a fair inference,
Justice Scalia. Of course, we don't know because she
was never -- she's never herself submitted to cross
examination. But there are mandatory arrest laws in
the State of Washington. She had a no-contact order
against Mr. Davis, both of which a reasonable person
would understand that a call for 911 would be
tantamount to a call for arrest.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said -- you said we
don't know, but you -- that's slightly in conflict with
what you said earlier. They asked 26 questions. How
long was this telephone conversation between the 911
operator and the victim?
MR. FISHER: It's about 4 minutes, Justice
Ginsburg. And it's not -- what we submit is -- of
course, we've given you in the joint appendix the
structured protocol that the 911 operator was following
in this case, and we submit that it's not mere
happenstance that the 911 call was able to establish
every element of the crime, right down to Mr. Davis'
birth date that the prosecutor referred to in her
closing argument that the 911 operator elicited from
Ms. McCottry. And, indeed, the only question --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought that
was -- I thought that was to determine if there were
outstanding orders and warrants against the individual.
MR. FISHER: It may be, and that may be
another example, Mr. Chief Justice, of a -- of a --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's related --
that's related to sending people to prevent crime as
opposed to gathering evidence to be used to convict.
MR. FISHER: I don't want to dispute that 911
operators in this situation, just like responding
officers, are gathering information for dual purposes.
They may well be trying to resolve an ongoing threat
of a felon at large. At the same time, of course, all
of the information and training manuals that we've
provided to you in the reply brief make it clear that
from the initial contact with the alleged victim, they
are gathering evidence all the while.
And in fact, the only thing you can think of
-- at least, I can't think of a single question that a
prosecutor might have asked at a trial that the 911
operator didn't ask here. The only questions that
really immediately come to mind are ones that might
have been asked in cross examination. For example --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the only
question -- what if a 911 caller says nothing more
than, in a very excited way, someone is attacking me,
send a police officer right away to make the person
stop attacking me? Is that testimonial?
MR. FISHER: To the extent that the person is
saying someone is attacking me, that kernel may -- may
well be testimonial, Justice Alito. However, if
somebody calls 911 and says, please send help to 911
Main -- or 3312 Main Street, that may well not be
testimonial. And that -- a mere cry for help -- and
this goes to Justice Ginsburg's question as well. A
simple cry for help may -- may not be testimonial.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But a simple cry for help
that doesn't say I'm being battered may not elicit an
immediate response on the part of the police. This
kind of call, I need help now, and the information that
comes with it is likely to be given priority attention
as this very call was.
MR. FISHER: I think that's a fair inference,
but the -- the priority attention, in terms of going
and apprehending Mr. Davis, is exactly what triggers
criminal justice system and exactly what makes the kind
of a statement, the one that the -- one that the
Confrontation Clause should care about.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you have any --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're not
sending someone -- they're not sending someone to
apprehend Mr. Davis. They're sending someone to
prevent him from attacking his wife.
MR. FISHER: I'm not sure it's easy to
separate one from the other, Mr. Chief Justice. The
way that they are doing that is by arresting him. They
have a mandatory arrest law in Washington that says
that the way that the police must respond to a call
like this is to arrest --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? I
-- I guess in an awful lot of these cases there's a
mixed motive: protection and enforcement. Is it
your view that whenever there's a mixed motive, it
becomes inadmissible?
MR. FISHER: No, Justice Stevens. It's our
view that you really ought not be looking or focusing
on the police officer motive or on the governmental
agent's motive for the very reason that you start to
get into these knotty questions of what exactly were
they trying to accomplish. And we believe a better
-- a better default than -- if you can't simply answer
it by looking at history and precedent, is to look more
towards the declarant's reasonable expectation. And
that's what this Court does in the Fifth Amendment when
it --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in doing that, do you
distinguish, for example, between the -- the
expectation that lies behind a merely excited
utterance, on the one hand, and the expectation or lack
of expectation that would qualify -- that would be the
case in a -- in a true res gestae statement in the very
strict sense? So that, you know, if -- if the attack
had occurred 30 minutes beforehand and -- and the
victim is saying on the telephone to the police, Adrian
is trying to kill me, that would be -- that -- that
wouldn't -- would not be admissible, I take it, on --
on your view under the Confrontation Clause. And yet,
if in the course of the 911 call, Adrian was battering
the -- the -- you know, the victim over the head with
something and she blurted out the same statement, he's
trying to kill me, would the -- would the latter be
admissible in your case --
MR. FISHER: The latter --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- under your theory?
MR. FISHER: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry. I misspoke. On
your theory.
MR. FISHER: The latter is a very close case,
Justice Souter. I think you're right insofar as it --
it can be important to distinguish between a modern-day
excited utterance and what would have been considered a
res gestae type statement at common law.
Certainly if you take away the 911 call from
your hypothetical and she says, please don't hurt me,
Adrian, that may well be the kind of a statement that
would be inside the res gestae. Once somebody picks up
the phone to call 911, that, by my reading of the
historical cases, turns it into a report or a
narrative.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So that the answer to my
question is there would be no distinction between the
merely excited utterance 30 seconds later and the
utterance in the course of in -- in my hypo.
MR. FISHER: We believe that as long as it is
making a report to a third party, there ought not be a
distinction. Now, of course, you don't have to wrestle
with that in this case because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You say according to your
reading of the cases, but you really don't have a case
like this. You -- you have a case where, after the
fact, the -- the victim went to a constable or to some
other official to report the event, and perhaps to seek
help against the person who -- but you don't have
anything where really, in the course -- in the course
of the attack or -- or while the person is still at
least under threat, a -- a constable is -- is called,
do you?
MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Scalia, of course,
we didn't have telephone technology, so --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You could have -- you could
have somebody walking by -- a policeman walking by
outside.
MR. FISHER: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And the victim shouting, you
know, please, somebody help me, Harry is beating me.
You don't have a case like that. So -- so I don't know
why we should flop one side rather than the other on
this -- on this case that -- that doesn't seem covered
by -- by the old jurisprudence. Why should we go your
way on it and say that it -- it falls within the
prohibition rather than say it falls outside the
prohibition?
MR. FISHER: Well, for two reasons, Justice
Scalia. One is we do have the hue and cry scenario
that we've talked about.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that's not this
case.
MR. FISHER: And we think the fair --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That --
MR. FISHER: It's not exactly on all fours
with this case, but we think the fair inference, when
you read the treatises and the reasons why those kinds
of statements were kept out, is that if they simply --
if the police or their agents were able to get the
statement just a little bit sooner, the answer would
have been the same.
And we do have cases, Justice Scalia, where
people made fresh accusations or cry-outs to private
parties to -- to another -- to a witness who wasn't
even associated with law enforcement, and we have a
whole section of our brief pointing out that for
decades after the founding, even those kinds of
statements were kept out of evidence in criminal trials
for the reason --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Because of the -- because of
the Confrontation Clause you think?
MR. FISHER: Well, I -- I think it's a fair
inference, Justice Scalia, from reading the historical
precedent and the treatises that describe it. They --
they describe these as, in -- in a sense, second-class
testimony. They say the problem with statements like
this, if they're made even seconds after the event in
place, is that they're -- at that point they're nothing
more than a narrative and require us to give credit to
a statement -- and this is the words the treatise
writers used to use -- that was not given under the
ordinary tests for determining the accuracy of
testimony. And when they used the word like testimony
and they talk about the usual tests and the customary
way of testing out-of-court statements, I think the
fair inference is they're referring to the right to
confrontation.
Perhaps another way to think about this is to
take a step back and say, what if we decide that
statements like this are not testimonial? The
practical -- the practical impact of that is not simply
that these statements won't -- will come in, but that
prosecutors and -- prosecutors, Federal and State
government, will have no incentive whatsoever to ever
bring 911 callers into court. It -- it is -- across
State hearsay law across the country, these are deemed
excited utterances. So if this Court were to say --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not --
that's not true at all. I mean, if -- if the -- the
witness may be a good witness and compelling on the
stand, they may have every incentive to bring her in in
person. This is only addressed to the situations where
the witness is unwilling or unable to testify.
MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, I think you
got to the heart of the matter when you said that if
it's a good witness, the prosecutor will put them on.
The flip side of that is that if the witness isn't so
good, the prosecutor would have every incentive at
least not to put them on the stand. Why would somebody
put on a stand -- put somebody on a stand that doesn't
seem perhaps credible or maybe subject to impeachment
when they have, in a sense, testimony in a sealed tape
recorder already?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume the defendant
could summon that -- that witness if -- if that
witness' location was known. No?
MR. FISHER: Well, the defendant --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And could find out from the
prosecution where that witness was, I assume.
MR. FISHER: The defendant might be able to
do that. But, of course, that would -- treating the
case this way would collapse the confrontation right
into the Compulsory Process Clause. The confrontation
right is a right not to be able to bring witnesses into
court. It's to be confronted with the witnesses
against --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Justice Scalia's
question raises the -- the point. The reason these
witnesses are not there is not because of anything that
the government has done. It's -- it's the concern they
have, the particular domestic abuse situation. It's
not the government that is keeping these witnesses out.
They're not relying on the 911 calls as a matter of
preference.
MR. FISHER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think
your assumption may not be entirely correct. There's a
-- there's a portion from, for example, the San Diego
prosecutor's office decided, and I believe in the NACDL
brief, that says oftentimes they do prefer to -- to
leave the witness off the stand because they have a
better case just using the -- the excited utterance
type statements.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there --
suppose the defendant procured the witness' absence by
a threat.
MR. FISHER: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then the 911 statement
could come in. Right?
MR. FISHER: That's right. That's right.
And perhaps -- and this gets back to the Chief
Justice's question as well. It helps maybe to separate
these kinds of cases into three categories.
We first have the category that the
prosecution would prefer not to put the person on the
stand. We think there the Confrontation Clause ought
to require them to do so.
We -- we next have the category where the
defendant, as you say, procures the witness' absence.
We don't dispute that in that scenario the forfeiture
doctrine kicks in, which this Court reaffirmed in
Crawford. We don't have any forfeiture question in
this case.
And then we have perhaps the gray area, where
a witness goes missing through no fault of anybody's,
and this Court has said over and over again that there
the confrontation right puts the onus onto the
prosecution.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those are -- those are
three neat legal categories. The practical reality, is
it not so, is that many women in these situations are
scared to death of what will happen to them or they're
so insecure financially that they think they have to
put up with the battering? So your neat legal
categories really don't conform to what happens in
people's lives who are in this situation.
MR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, I don't want
to be insensitive to -- to witnesses in this situation.
Of course, reluctant witnesses is nothing new, but --
but in domestic violence, it's an acute problem.
However, we believe the proper way to deal
with that situation is by this Court developing its
forfeiture doctrine. The Sixth Amendment applies
across the board to all criminal cases, Justice
Ginsburg, and we've cited, for example, in the appendix
to our reply brief about 30 cases from the last couple
years that have been handled in a victimless fashion
like this that are not domestic violence cases --
JUSTICE BREYER: How would you do that? How
would you do that forfeiture?
MR. FISHER: Pardon me?
JUSTICE BREYER: How would you do that? I'm
interested in that because I thought it sounded good.
Then I thought about it. I thought to have forfeiture,
you'd have to show that this defendant, in fact, forced
the wife not to testify. It's a crime to do that. So
you'd have to prove another crime against the defendant
in order to prove the first crime. And I thought
perhaps that doctrine is not very practical. You tell
me why it is.
MR. FISHER: Well, that's already what
happens under the Federal Rules of Evidence and under
the evidence of many States, that there is a rule of
forfeiture by wrongdoing. And so --
JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. My point
is that to prove the wrongdoing would probably be even
harder than to prove the original crime. All we know
is the wife isn't there.
MR. FISHER: I'm not --
JUSTICE BREYER: And we suspect that she's
afraid of her husband. He may have offered to cut off
financial aid, said goodbye, no money, or he may have
done worse. I'm just saying you're telling us that
because the prosecution can prove that in court and
only then will it be able to introduce the testimony
given beforehand by the missing wife.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER: How does it work?
MR. FISHER: Well, I think we have -- Justice
Breyer, like in lots of other scenarios, you have a
pretrial hearing, and at that pretrial hearing, of
course, the rules of evidence don't strictly apply the
way they would in the guilt phase. So in this very
case, if you look at the joint appendix, when -- when
on the eve of trial Ms. McCottry is no longer going to
show up for trial, the prosecutor says, I want to
subpoena the jail records and I want to talk to the
victim's advocate to find out whether she's been
intimidated or kept away. So the prosecutor herself
tells the court how she's going to look for this
evidence. If she had found anything, presumably she
would have presented it and she could have presented it
that way. And it's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe we should just -- just
suspend the Confrontation Clause in spousal abuse cases
instead of designing the entire application of the
Confrontation Clause everywhere on the basis of what
seems to be a special problem in spousal abuse cases.
MR. FISHER: Well, of course, Justice Scalia,
the Sixth Amendment says all criminal prosecutions --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand.
MR. FISHER: -- and domestic violence cases
are criminal prosecutions. So we don't think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And I suppose we could also
have said that the Sixth Amendment, like some other
amendments, doesn't apply to State prosecutions --
MR. FISHER: That's right, but we've --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- or the Confrontation
Clause portion of it, anyway --
MR. FISHER: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which would exempt spousal
abuse cases, by and large, until we -- until we enact a
Federal spousal abuse statute, which -- which may well
occur. It seems to me there -- there are better ways to
-- to solve this problem than to design the whole
Confrontation Clause jurisprudence on the basis of what
happens in spousal abuse cases.
MR. FISHER: I think that's a fair comment.
And let -- let me say there are two -- there
are many ways that you can do that, Justice Scalia, and
two of them were readily available to the State in this
case. One is even when a witness goes missing or is
unwilling to testify in a hard case, there may well be
other ways to prove the case. Here, the caller said --
JUSTICE BREYER: This is true, but the reason
I thought spousal abuse cases are relevant --
MR. FISHER: Pardon me?
JUSTICE BREYER: A reason I thought they were
relevant is just what you're about to address. They're
evidentiary of the problem that exists when you bring
something within the Confrontation Clause. Prior to
Crawford, even though it was within the clause, if it
fell within a well-recognized exception to the hearsay
rule, it could come in. So you could bring in co-
conspirators before the conspiracy ended. You could
bring in, for sure, excited utterances. You could
bring in all kinds of things that now, no matter how
reliable, you have to keep them out.
MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Breyer,
but --
JUSTICE BREYER: And so that is a problem
that you have to address in respect to drawing a fairly
narrow line, and I want to know what that narrow line
is with spousal abuse and other cases in mind.
MR. FISHER: Let me give you two ways this
case, if -- if we assume the State's version of
events is correct, could have easily been proved.
One is that the caller said that a man named
Mike was at her house during the entire event. When
the police showed up at her house some 5 minutes later,
they never even got Mike's last name. And, of course,
Justice Breyer, the reason why is because they were
probably thinking of the Roberts framework and that
they wouldn't need this witness, but good old-fashioned
police work would have presumably found a witness that
witnessed the whole event that they could have put on
the stand.
The second thing the State could have done in
this case is they could have filed the case in a way
that they obtained a preliminary hearing. If what the
State says is correct that Ms. McCottry was cooperating
up until the last minute, that's a classic scenario
where, by way of having a preliminary hearing and
subjecting her to cross examination at the preliminary
hearing, they could have preserved her testimony. This
Court in California against Green and Roberts itself
said that those kinds of prior pretrial cross
examination scenarios are good enough to satisfy the
Confrontation Clause.
And if the Court has no further questions,
I'll reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Fisher.
Mr. Whisman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. WHISMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WHISMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it
please the Court:
In this 911 call, the operator asked a short
series of questions, nearly all phrased in the present
tense. Each question was objectively and reasonably
necessary to respond to an apparent emergency.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Like what is his name? I
mean, that's the present tense. Not what was his name
or what will be his name. What is his name? You think
that's the present tense. So that shows that this is
all seeking help.
MR. WHISMAN: No, a number of other
questions, Justice Scalia, were answered -- were asked
in the present -- present tense too. And, in fact, the
operator, shortly after asking the first questions, one
of the first things that she said was help was on the
way and then continued with a series of questions. But
as the interview continued, of course, every single
question and every single answer was captured on the
tape for a jury or a judge to later hear. The call
ended after the operator knew that Ms. McCottry had her
door locked, that Davis had left, and that the
officer's arrival was imminent.
We ask -- respectfully ask this Court, under
these circumstances, to hold that the use of this
powerful evidence, without live testimony from the
declarant, was constitutionally permissible.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, powerful is part
of the problem. This -- this kind of telephone call
evidence is even more powerful than -- than the kind of
a signed affidavit that used to be banned because it
was testimonial. I mean, to hear -- to hear the voice
on the phone makes it, if it is -- if it is
impermissible under the Confrontation Clause, it makes
it even a more damaging violation than the kind of
violation that -- that occurred in -- in Sir Walter
Raleigh's case, for example.
MR. WHISMAN: Well, I'd respectfully
disagree, Your Honor, although I'd -- I'd first note
that -- that I think the if clause in Your Honor's
question is telling. And I think if that -- that
doesn't necessarily define whether it's testimonial or
not. But to address --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Would you -- would you
rather put the woman on -- if you had a choice, would
you rather put the woman on the stand?
MR. WHISMAN: Absolutely, Your Honor, and --
and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Rather than have her -- her
voice on the telephone call --
MR. WHISMAN: Well, if I had to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- when she is -- she is in
-- in -- supposedly in great fear of -- of her husband
and -- and -- I'm sure you'd rather have the telephone
call.
MR. WHISMAN: If you're asking me which would
I chose --
JUSTICE SCALIA: As a prosecutor.
MR. WHISMAN: Well, if I had to chose, that
would be a difficult choice, obviously, but our plan,
of course, was to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it would be an easy
choice.
MR. WHISMAN: Our -- our plan was to do both,
and it wasn't until the eve of trial that we learned
that the complaining witness, Ms. McCottry, wasn't
going to appear. And I think that the circumstances --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Did -- did you subpoena her
at that point?
MR. WHISMAN: She was already subpoenaed,
Your Honor, and the prosecutor brought in the
detective. The detective attempt -- made numerous
attempts to get a hold of her, checked her last known
address. The person there didn't know where she was.
We had one phone number for her. She wasn't responding
to the telephone calls pursuant to our calls to that
number. So we made a number of efforts that are
documented in the record to get her to court, once we
learned that -- that she didn't appear.
Now, at that point --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your -- your
position is not that anything that she says or anything
anyone says in a 911 call is -- is consistent with the
Confrontation Clause.
MR. WHISMAN: That's right, Your Honor. It's
conceivable that you could have statements made in the
course of a 911 call that wouldn't be testimonial.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what is your --
what is your test? We have your friend saying any
accusatory statement made to a law enforcement officer.
What -- what is your proposal?
MR. WHISMAN: Our focus, Your Honor, is, as I
think this Court focused in Crawford on whether or not
the government's practice resembles the inquisitorial
abuses. In other words, did you have -- in the modern
sense, did you have a structured police interrogation
such that the interrogator or the questioner might have
in some way shaped the witness' testimony.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher tells us
that's exactly what happens, that the 911 operator goes
through the elements of the crime in a very structured
way.
MR. WHISMAN: Well, I -- I think if you
listen to the tape itself, you'll conclude that's not
the case. I mean, in fact, each question that the --
that the operator asked was reasonably and objectively
designed to facilitate a quick response and to solve
the emergency that was apparent.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's -- let's not overread
Crawford. Crawford didn't say that the only thing the
Confrontation Clause was directed at was the kind of
abuse that -- that occurred in the case of Sir Walter
Raleigh. It said that that was the principal abuse at
which it was directed. I doubt very much, unless you
think otherwise, that if somebody, without provocation
from the police, wrote up an affidavit, signed the
affidavit, and gave it to the police, I doubt whether
that would have been allowed under the Confrontation
Clause. Do you think it would have?
MR. WHISMAN: Well, it may not have, Your
Honor, but the -- under the test that we're proposing,
the -- we're placing the focus on situations like this,
situations roughly analogous -- situations that are
distinguishable from what you had with Sylvia Crawford.
And I think that although -- although our test may not
cover every conceivable hypothetical, I think that, as
this Court recognized in Crawford, defining testimonial
was going to be a -- a task that was going to take some
time, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Your test wouldn't cover the
example I just gave.
MR. WHISMAN: Yes, right -- that's right, Your
Honor. Our test would not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that that
should be admissible in a criminal trial?
MR. WHISMAN: No, I don't. I think it --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --
MR. WHISMAN: -- that should be inadmissible,
but it should be inadmissible because of the rules of
--
hearsay. And I think in most States in the Union, it
would be inadmissible. I can't think of a hearsay
example that would permit it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, now the person disappears
afterwards, is unavailable.
MR. WHISMAN: Fair enough. But it's not an
excited utterance. It's not a present sense
impression. I can't imagine a hearsay exception that
would admit it, which is really what brings us back to
the core of our theory, too, and that is that -- that
under the Confrontation Clause, as defined in Crawford,
we now have an absolute rule covering a finite --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I can't imagine that that
wouldn't have been covered by the Confrontation Clause
MR. WHISMAN: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- such -- such an obvious
violation of your right to confront your accuser, and
just because it was presented to the police without --
without an initial interrogation by the police, I don't
think that would have made any difference at common
law.
MR. WHISMAN: And -- and, Your Honor, it may
be that at some point the Court expands the definition
in -- in Crawford of testimonial -- formalized
testimonial materials to include something like that,
but I think that in situations where you have an
encounter between police and citizen and statements
result, then I think it's fair to focus on the
interaction and whether or not the -- the person was
trying to shape the testimony.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree that that's the
extreme, but you're urging us to -- to adopt a test
that embraces only the extreme and does not embrace the
hypothetical I just gave you. And you -- you can
accept that hypothetical without saying that you lose
this case, but it seems to me the test you're proposing
is -- is really quite extreme.
MR. WHISMAN: Well, Your Honor, as I say, the
test we're proposing I think would cover the majority
of cases. The hypothetical that Your Honor posed was
-- is -- is itself I think somewhat unusual. We -- we
do not get statements of that nature. We do not see
them being offered into evidence. And as I say, I
think that if -- if we saw cases like that, if we saw
statements that were admitted, there may be other ways
under the clause that the Court could interpret the
Confrontation Clause to exclude them.
I'm not arguing for the admissibility of that
evidence. Quite frankly, I've never in my life even
seen a piece of evidence like that offered. All I'm
saying is that I don't believe it falls under this
narrow definition of the Confrontation Clause that you
outlined in the Crawford case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why don't you incorporate
what the Solicitor General has suggested, that is, you
draw the line at urgent emergency statements that are
calling for -- for immediate help?
MR. WHISMAN: We certainly don't have any
objections to the Solicitor General's approach, Your
Honor, and -- and in fact, in some ways, because we're
analyzing a case like this that arose in an emergency
circumstance, I think that it's clear that -- that
statements that are made in those circumstances, just
by their very nature, aren't going to be testimonial.
People don't testify in an emergency. We chose not to
take that approach doctrinally just because we didn't
think it was as closely tied to the approach the Court
took in Crawford. But I think it's certainly
consistent with the strategy outlined by the Solicitor
General.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what do we do about
the -- about the fact, which I don't think you -- you
deny and -- and the -- the other side points out in
both of these cases that, in fact, police departments
have their responders to the 911 number intentionally
ask a series of questions that gives them all the
information they need to conduct a prosecution? In
other words, they are using 911 as a -- as a
prosecutorial device.
MR. WHISMAN: Well, I think that overstates
the empirical evidence, Your Honor. I think that if
you look at the training manual in this case that we
attached to our briefing in the Supreme Court and refer
to our briefing, if you look at the way that this
interview was conducted, it's clear that these
operators are not, as a routine matter, using the 911
process to develop evidence.
In fact, in this case you'll note that --
that after the short 4-minute period, the operator
didn't say, well, stay on the line with me a little bit
more and let's talk about the background situation
here. And she didn't do that because her training, as
documented in the training materials from the Valley
Communications Center, said don't get caught up in the
background information that led to this event because
it can distract you in getting the information that
needs to be transferred to the police department right
away. And I think that that is a perfectly reasonable
and really the -- the better approach for a 911
operator. So even though --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did -- did she wait until
after the 4 minutes to call the police, or did she --
she have the police on the way after the first minute?
MR. WHISMAN: It sounds as though that she
dispatched them immediately, Your Honor, because --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: She -- she's just typed
that out on the computer or something like that?
MR. WHISMAN: That's right. And, in fact,
there are some times when you can hear all three voices
on the 911 tape, not in this instance. But as I said,
almost immediately after the call began, she said, help
is on the way, that's because you can dispatch but
still obtain information, for example, the date of
birth. And as Mr. Chief Justice indicated, date of
birth of the defendant and name, et cetera are
extremely important so that in those 4 minutes that it
-- coincidentally, it was also 4 minutes before the
police officer arrived -- they can be determining
whether or not the defendant has criminal history.
They can determine whether or not, from their records
available to them in their police car, whether or not the
defendant has a history of assaults against police
officers, whether or not he has a -- a history of
carrying weapons, et cetera. So that's all information
that the operators are trained to -- to obtain and then
to transfer to the police as soon as possible.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And she's -- she's in
ongoing -- the operator is in ongoing contact with the
people she's -- the operator has dispatched. Right?
MR. WHISMAN: Correct, Your Honor, and that's
why -- that's why ordinarily the operator doesn't
terminate the call until the police have arrived on the
scene. Here it appears that she terminated the call
somewhat contemporaneously with their arrival. She --
she indicates that the police are there and they'll
look around for him quickly and then come and check
her.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What do you have to say
about the failure to inquire about Mike?
MR. WHISMAN: Your Honor, I -- I don't think
that's as significant as Petitioner suggests. If you
look at the record, in the pretrial testimony of
Officer Jones, he asked Ms. McCottry, upon arrival,
repeatedly did she know who this other person was, and
her answer was she didn't know the person's last name.
The record isn't fully developed on that point, but it
sounds like that -- that Mike was a friend of the
defendant's. And we know for sure that Mike left with
the defendant. I think it's reasonable to infer he
also came with the defendant, but we didn't have any
particular contact or handle on this person Mike.
And in fact, if it was a friend of the
defendant, you'd think that the Compulsory Process
Clause would have given the defendant some basis on
which to bring him before the court. I don't think
that that includes any of the -- that -- that doesn't
somehow shift the burden on the defendant in the same
way it might if were to force him to bring the
declarant in. If he knew Mike, he -- he certainly had
the ability to bring Mike in. So I don't think it's as
significant as Petitioner suggests.
Your Honor, I -- I do want to return for just
one moment to this notion that we don't want witnesses
to testify and that we are satisfied with proceeding
just on -- on the basis of other pieces of evidence.
At least in my practice and at least in our county,
that's definitely not true. In fact, even if we have a
recanting witness in, for example, the domestic
violence abuse scenario -- situation, it is often just
as effective for us to go ahead and put -- put the
witness up on the stand, let her tell whatever story
she's presently telling, and then play the 911 -- 911
tape also in conjunction with the testimony of the
officers who can describe what -- what condition she
was in when they arrived. And I think when you
juxtapose the 911 tape, even with the recantation from
the witness, frankly sometimes the jurors find it even
more illuminating than -- than if she didn't appear.
So we do not spend our time trying to put together
cases purposely without the victim testifying. It just
so happens that sometimes, at the last minute like this
case, we're not able to bring the person in.
But I think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: How -- how often does this
happen? In other words, are we being asked to, in
effect, on your part to -- to recognize or to derive a
special rule for cases which, at least numerically, are
sports?
MR. WHISMAN: Your Honor, I do -- I cannot
answer in a percentage terms how often this happens.
But, you know, that you have a reluctant witness in
domestic violence cases is a -- is a not unusual
occurrence in any event. But I don't think that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but I'm talking about
the witness who is not merely reluctant, but simply
doesn't show up and you make reasonable efforts and you
-- and you can't find the witness. How often does that
happen?
MR. WHISMAN: As I say, I'm -- I'm hard-
--
pressed to give a -- a percentage number. But it's
not, as I said --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Has it happened to you
before?
MR. WHISMAN: I believe it has.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But you don't know how many
times.
MR. WHISMAN: I can't say, no, Your Honor. I
can't say. I think it's maybe happened once to me, but
JUSTICE SOUTER: So we're not -- I take it
we're not in a position whereby if we hold against you,
we are, in effect, nullifying the possibility of
enforcing domestic violence laws by criminal process.
MR. WHISMAN: Well, I -- I think the other
factor that has to be considered, Your Honor, is as soon
-- as soon as defendants realize that merely pressuring
the victim into not appearing will put an end to the
case, then it gives the defendant the increased
incentive to put the pressure on the victim and cases
that otherwise would have pled won't. So I think it
will have --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Disappearing. Not just not
appearing. Disappearing.
MR. WHISMAN: Yes. I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. WHISMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
A panic-stricken call for help, which can
occur on a 911 call, is not a form of bearing witness
within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause that
activates the rule in Crawford. Emergency statements,
statements that are made to 911 operators and to
officers at the scene investigating an urgent need to
protect a person's safety, do not resemble the classic
forms of testimonial evidence that were generated under
the Marian statutes and the civil law practice that
formed the impetus for the Confrontation Clause. In
three significant respects, statements that are made in
emergency questioning differ from the kind of testimony
that prompted the rule in Crawford and the
confrontation right that it rests on.
First of all, in the classic examples of
someone giving testimony, which this Court noted means
a solemn declaration or affirmation for the purpose of
proving a fact, people who are on 911 calls or seeking
help at the scene of an -- an urgent situation are not
making statements for the purpose of providing evidence
in a case. They are making statements for the purpose
of obtaining help, and that distinguishes them
significantly from the kinds of subtle desires to shape
and influence their statements that occur --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe. I mean,
it's easy to imagine a 911 call that doesn't fit your
description. You know, the person is trying to get in
the door. The call is -- you know, this is the fourth
time. I keep calling and I've talked to you about
this. You don't do anything. He's got to be locked up
so this will stop. I mean, that's not -- that sounds
more like testimony than an immediate call for help.
MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, we would
distinguish between those kinds of 911 calls where
someone is seeking protection from an imminent or
present threat to their safety and a 911 call that's
making a more generalized report of criminal activity
or a desire for safety and maybe speaking in a
narrative form about the past.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the husband had left
the house here, as I understand it, when this -- when
this call occurred.
MR. DREEBEN: Actually, Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: She -- she wanted the man
arrested, but he was no longer in the house, was he?
MR. DREEBEN: Actually, Justice Scalia, I
believe when the call begins, the caller is speaking in
the present tense and says, he's here jumping on me
again. And the 911 operator then begins to elicit
information to find out what is the level of the threat
to her safety and what actions need to be taken and
says, okay, I've got help started. Help is on the way.
Now, tell me what his name is, and she -- the -- the
caller tells what the name is of the defendant and, at
that point, says, he's running now. And so, it's only
after critical information is imparted at the beginning
of the call that the caller says that he's leaving.
But even --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And then what -- what's your
position if she says he beat me 2 minutes ago, he's
left, and he's running down the block?
MR. DREEBEN: I think in that situation,
Justice Kennedy, there is still an imminent threatened
potential of a recurrence. The person could come back.
There's no protection on the scene. The reason that
she's calling 911 and not a friend or -- or a health
care provider is that she believes she needs protection
right then. And the -- the nature of an emergency is
such that it exerts a pressure both on the person who
is seeking help, as well as the official responder from
the government, to solve that urgent problem. Any
evidentiary benefit that may come from that is really
an incidental --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose -- suppose
it's a thief, and she said he's taken the diamond
necklace and he's running -- and he's running away. We
know he's not going to come back.
MR. DREEBEN: That -- that situation would
not fall within the emergency rule that the Government
is arguing for today. What we're arguing for is a rule
that deals when people's safety is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the -- the jewelry store
owner who reports to the -- the police is fleeing on a
1, that -- that's not -- that's not admissible under
your view?
MR. DREEBEN: No. I'm not saying that,
Justice Kennedy. I'm saying that the Court isn't
confronted in this case with a situation in which
threats not to the person but to property or the need
to obtain or try to apprehend a fleeing felon are
present.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what -- what about
the -- my hypothetical?
MR. DREEBEN: We would submit that that is
not testimonial within the meaning of Crawford for many
of the same reasons that -- that are present in this
case. But it is a different case from this.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean by seeking
help? I mean, it seems to me you're saying seeking
help means trying to get somebody arrested, trying to
get somebody who has harmed you arrested. In this
case, he was gone out of the house. She had gone and
locked the door before she came back to the phone and
gave most of this testimony.
MR. DREEBEN: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and in the -- in the
jeweler case, the guy is running down the street. What
is the jeweler -- is the jeweler really worried about
the guy turning around and coming back to rob some
more? He wants the man arrested.
MR. DREEBEN: The urgency certainly in -- in
the jewelry thief hypothetical does deal with
apprehending the person who has just stolen the goods.
And that's why I say that it falls outside of the rule
that the Government is arguing for today.
But, Justice Scalia, I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm concerned about the
rule you're arguing today because it -- it seems to me
there's a good case for allowing the -- the statement
by the jewelry store operator.
MR. DREEBEN: I think there is a good --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and I want to know
what your position is so that you don't come back next
week and say, well, now we want the jewelry store --
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I'm not going to say that
we wouldn't, depending on how the Court analyzes this
case, argue for a submission that that's not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: We'd rather you analyze
the case now and then we'll analyze it later.
(Laughter.)
MR. DREEBEN: What the Court needs to analyze
today is whether an emergency statement where somebody
is seeking protection and there is a threat of imminent
recurrence of the very violence that has triggered the
call is testimony. And it's not testimony because the
sort of risks of government shaping and the declarant
focus on providing evidence for use in a criminal case
are not present, and the information has, as Justice
Scalia pointed out, a unique probative value that's
very different from the kind of submission of an
affidavit or submitting to a civil law deposition that
prompted the confrontation right.
The Framers were thinking about things that
we all would recognize as testimony, being deposed,
submitting an affidavit, appearing before a -- a
magistrate in a pretrial proceeding, and they used the
word witness in the Confrontation Clause not only to
refer to the kinds of statements that were covered, but
in connection with knowledge that the same word appears
in the Fifth Amendment and in the Sixth Amendment
Compulsory Process Clause, where in all of those
contexts, its most natural application is to the formal
acquisition of evidence.
JUSTICE BREYER: What do you say in that
respect about the blue brief's reference to 17th
century cases, the hue and the cry where someone went
out and told the sheriff, help, I'm being beaten up,
and that that evidence wasn't admissible?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think what's really
striking, Justice Breyer, is that there is no 17th
century case law that reflects that. There's really a
virtual, complete absence on the other side of this
case of an affirmative argument supported by decided
cases that says that evidence of that character was
even known to the Framers, let alone excluded.
If you look closely at their constable cases,
which is the closest cases that they -- they submit,
one of them is a report from the Old Bailey online
source which contains transcripts of criminal trials in
-- in England, and one of them, the Radbourne case, is
right around the time of the framing, and there's a
little line in the transcript where the constable says,
well, I bent down and I asked the victim something and
then the judge says, well, don't say that. There's no
evidence that that was regarded as a -- a legal ruling
under confrontation principles. There's no evidence
that the Framers were aware of the Radbourne Old
Bailey report, and there's additional statutory basis
in the treason statute, which was applicable there,
which said that all evidence had to be given face to
face. So that's their primary authority.
Their next authority --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's -- it's -- it may
be not a lot, but it's something. You don't have
anything to the contrary.
MR. DREEBEN: What we have --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have anything
which shows that these hue and cry reports were
admitted, and there were a lot of them. They -- they
were done regularly.
MR. DREEBEN: The hue and cry reports,
Justice Scalia, as I think your earlier questioning
suggested, do not necessarily involve the kind of
emergency situation what -- that we have here where a
person is reaching out from an ongoing present criminal
act against them and seeking help. And the fact that
we have very little evidence at all of how 17th century
British law handled this is really, I think, persuasive
evidence that the Court should not deem the
confrontation right as a response to some sort of
abuses in this area.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I would say that a hue and
cry report is not the same as a woman being beaten and
-- and picking up the phone while the crime is in
progress. But I think it's quite similar to the -- the
jewelry hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave you
which you're unwilling to say is -- is not covered by
the -- is covered by the Confrontation Clause, and I
think it's quite similar to a woman, where the husband
has left and she's locked the door and she wants the
husband arrested. I think it's quite similar to that.
But for the telephone, it's -- it's someone who's been
the victim of a crime who goes to a public official, as
soon as possible, and says, I've been -- I've been
subject to a crime. I want to report the crime and
have the person arrested. I think it's very similar.
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, first of all,
there is evidence that the hue and cry practice
existed. There is not evidence about how hue and cry
reports were viewed as a matter of evidence law. It is
very difficult to transpose into 17th and 18th century
English practice what we are dealing with now, in part
because the system of public prosecutions that we have
today where an official prosecutor representing the
State carries the ball in a criminal case did not
exist. The accuser had to appear in court as the
private prosecutor. If the accuser did not appear,
there was no prosecution, and these prosecutions were
simply dismissed because there was no one official on
the scene to carry the ball. So the -- the speculation
that's required requires a number of inferential leaps
that Petitioners have to make in order to draw an
analogy.
And at the same time, there really is an
intuitive difference between the kinds of statements
that people make in emergencies and the kind of core
testimonial statements that we know prompted the
confrontation right, the Sir Walter Raleigh case
involving affidavits and letters, the Marian practice
under which testimony was formally taken in the calm of
a magistrate's rooming house rather than in the
immediate aftermath or time when a crime was actually
ongoing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben, you say
focus on the emergency nature. Very little of what
took place in the 911 call is emergency. He's beating
me. He's jumping on me. Yes. What's his name? I
mean, it's not like they'll send help if his name is
Joe but they won't if it's Mike. It doesn't matter.
Which direction is he running? That's not related to
the emergency nature of the -- of the call.
MR. DREEBEN: It is, Mr. Chief Justice, in
the sense that it's information that's needed to
respond to and resolve the imminent threat to this
woman's safety, which would certainly occur if the
individual decided to come back and finish what he'd
started. And if a law enforcement authority set up its
1 calls so as not to gather adequate information and
this individual had come back and actually beaten or
killed the victim, it would certainly be regarded as an
inadequate response to the emergency situation of an
ongoing violent attack. And so for that reason, the
rule that we're describing here for the Court would
deal with not only the present emergency but also its
imminent, threatened recurrence.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, rather than build that
into the law, it might be wiser to deal with Justice
Kennedy's case, in whatever system we come up with,
explaining it. So what is your full explanation of the
diamond necklace?
MR. DREEBEN: My -- my view on that is that
the kinds of statements that are made in the immediate
report of a crime are really in the form of excited
utterances that are much different from the kind of
dispassionate testimony that occurs after the fact that
prompted the confrontation right.
Now, the Court could accept that line and say
that jewelry thief reports are not testimony within the
meaning of the Confrontation Clause, or it could
disagree and say that no, when there's not the
immediate threatened, imminent potential for a
recurrence of the violence, then we're going to treat
that as closer to simply a report of a crime and treat
it as testimonial. Court could go either way on
that without touching the core of what's at issue
today, which is namely emergency situations that pose a
threat to the safety of the person who's making the
call or who's encountered by a law enforcement officer
on the scene in the immediate aftermath of an attack.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you wouldn't say that
every question asked in that context. Don't we have to
do it question by question? I mean, what if one of the
questions was, you know, has he beaten you before? How
many times before? You know, are you going to allow
that in too --
MR. DREEBEN: I think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- as an excited utterance?
MR. DREEBEN: -- the more that the -- the
questioning begins to delve into a past narrative of
past criminal activity, the more there is a reason to
think that it serves, in addition to its protection
purpose, an evidentiary purpose.
I'd hasten to add, Justice Scalia, that that
kind of information is very important for the officers
to know to gauge the seriousness of the threat, to get
the kind of idea of who they are dealing with, and to
respond effectively. So it is reasonably necessary for
those kinds of questions and that information to be
elicited.
But I also agree with Your Honor's suggestion
that not everything that occurs in a 911 call should be
regarded as per se non-testimonial. Not everything
that happens at the scene of a crime should be regarded
as per se non-testimonial. And naturally, the Court is
going to have to apply a certain degree of analysis to
the actual questions and answers that are given. But
if you look at the protocol in this case for the 911
call, if you look at the kinds of questions that were
asked and the information that was given, it is all
reasonably necessary to resolve an emergency by a
person who has really called in a state of extreme
stress. Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Dreeben.
Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER: Thank you.
Let me say a word about the record and then
two things about the emergency exception that we've
been talking about.
First, in the record it's always been
accepted in this case that Mr. Davis had left the house
when the 911 call started. In the joint appendix, page
7, that's what the Washington Supreme Court said, and
at page 30 of the evidentiary hearing in the trial
court, the prosecutor submitted the case that way as
well.
Now let me address the history here because
it's important. And Justice Scalia is exactly right.
There's not a single case historically where a
statement to a law enforcement agent accusing someone
of a crime was admitted in a criminal case. We're not
aware of one.
JUSTICE BREYER: That may be hearsay. That
may all be hearsay.
MR. FISHER: It -- it is what it is, Justice
Breyer. The -- the oldest case that is in the briefs
on the other side is White v. Illinois in 1992. So for
some 500 years before that. And -- and perhaps when we
have to draw an inference, we do have -- to a certain
degree we acknowledge the dog that doesn't bark. We
have evidence that was out there and simply wasn't
used.
Let's look at the history of the Marian
statutes. And I'm -- and I want to refer the Court
specifically to page 101 of Sir Matthew Hale's
treatise. He talks about the -- both the problem with
the hue and cry and then the reason we have the Marian
statutes. The reason we have the Marian statutes was
because for pretrial bail and committal hearings, the
courts were not prepared to simply go on the initial
reports. They wanted a formal examination of the
witness to use at even the pretrial hearing, to detain
the person pending trial. And Sir Matthew Hale at page
1 says the problem with the fresh reports the hue
and cry, is that -- is that they're not under oath.
They don't -- they don't even answer all the questions
that we would want answered.
So what the United States is asking you to
accept is that the kind of evidence that the Framers
would not have even been prepared to allow at a
pretrial bail hearing -- rather, they wanted to have
something more formal -- they would now accept to be
used in the trial itself. And what we think is that
this turns everything on its head. The reason the
Marian statutes were abused is because, of course, in
continental Europe that was an accepted form of
evidence, and so there was some reason to believe these
formal statements could be used. No one ever suggested
the hue and cry could be used.
Finally, let me say a word about police
incentives. If you accept the rule that the -- that
the United States and -- and the State is asking you to
accept, think about the incentives you put on 911
operators. They're not supposed to ask too many
questions. They're not supposed to get too much
information. The same would go for the responding
officer. They don't want to ask too many questions,
structured questions, make sure who did it, make sure
they have the details because then somehow these
statements become testimonial.
What our rule says is it frees the 911
operators, it frees the police officers to do what
they're supposed to do, which is immediately start
responding and both help people and start gathering
evidence from the moment that a crime is reported. And
that's what we think the Confrontation Clause is all
about. It's not -- it's about the way the case is
proved at trial. The Confrontation Clause -- as
opposed to other emergency doctrines this Court has in
the Fourth Amendment area, for example, the
Confrontation Clause has zero to say about the way
police officers do their jobs or the way the 911
operators do their jobs. If they go out and collect
structured affidavits under oath, if the 911 operator
put the caller under oath, there's nothing wrong with
that. If the 911 operator says, I want to be sure I
have this right, describe to me exactly what he looks
like, and tell me more about him, that's what we would
want somebody to do. And we shouldn't put a perverse
incentive for these first responders that, all of a
sudden, once they start gathering useful information
for the criminal justice system, that some sort of new
rule triggers.
All we're saying is that these are the kinds
of statements that were -- that the Framers would have
cared about and that they did care about, and that
nowadays if the State or other prosecutors want to use
them, they should be duty-bound to bring the witness
into court as well to submit the witness to cross
examination.
If there are no further questions, I'll
submit the case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I have one last question.
How do you think Professor Wigmore would have decided
this case?
(Laughter.)
MR. FISHER: Well, this Court noticed that
Professor Wigmore had the view that the Confrontation
Clause applied only to witnesses that actually took the
stand. So he would have thought the Confrontation
Clause didn't apply at all. But he would have
acknowledged to you -- and this is interesting from his
treatise -- that these were testimonial statements. He
said as soon as somebody starts -- as soon as in a
criminal trial we use a statement narrating a past
event, it's testimonial. However, Professor Wigmore
just didn't quite have the Confrontation Clause right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
