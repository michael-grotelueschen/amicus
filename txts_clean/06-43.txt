CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
next in Case 06-43, Stoneridge Investment Partners v.
Scientific-Atlanta, et al.
Mr. Grossman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY GROSSMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GROSSMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The text of section 10(b) as well as the
rule 10b-5 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission prohibit the use of any deceptive device by
any person, indirectly or indirectly, in connection with
the purchase or sale of a security.  The various
deceptive devices used by the Respondents in this case
is conduct that is squarely covered by the text of the
statute and by the rule.
Respondents here were not passive bystanders
facilitating a fraud by Charter.  Their deceptive
conduct was integral to the scheme to create fictitious
advertising revenues for Charter to report to investors.
Respondents agreed to overcharge Charter so
that they could receive the money from Charter to then
return to it for the advertising, using Charter's very
same money for the purchase of the advertising. 1
Respondent Scientific-Atlanta created a document
falsely claiming that the reason for the increased
payments from Charter were because of increased
manufacturing expenses.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The transaction was not
wholly without benefit to Scientific-Atlanta.  They got
some advertising.  And it was not wholly without benefit
to Charter.  They were able to show that advertising
works.  Now, that puts aside the fact that they were
using misleading accounting principles.
MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I would agree, Your
Honor, that they received free advertising.  But the
problem was that they were creating the illusion that it
wasn't free advertising, but rather that they were
purchasing the advertising.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And was the price four to
five times higher than the normal rates for advertising?
MR. GROSSMAN:  That is correct, Justice
Ginsburg.
And the obvious purpose for creating the
illusion that they were purchasing the advertising
rather than receiving free advertising was so that
Charter can incorporate these increased revenues in
their financial statements.  And Respondents understood,
they understood that in order to -- for Charter to pass 1
this by their accountants, to deceive the accountants --
and this is reflected in the indictment -- in order to
deceive the accountants for Charter, the Respondents
were told that there had to be separate agreements for
both the advertising agreements and the purchase
agreements.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Grossman, is there any
reason why, in principle, the elements for a cause of
action under 10b-5 have to be the same as the elements
for a cause of action by the agency under 10(b)?  I mean,
we, we created this, this cause of action.  It's not set
forth in the statute, although other private causes of
action are.
If it's our creation, couldn't we sensibly
limit it so that, for example, schemes can be attacked
by the SEC, but schemes do not form the basis for
private attorney general's actions?  You need actual
conveyance of a misrepresentation to the injured party.
Is there any reason why we couldn't do that?
MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I think there are two
reasons, Your Honor.  The first is that at this point in
time -- I think as the Court recognized in Dura fairly
recently -- that when Congress enacted the Private
Security Law Reform Act, that at that time they accepted
the private right of action that this Court had 1
previously inferred.  And this Court had previously
inferred the private right of action not only for the
section but each of the rules in Section 10(b).
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it's not like
under the Sherman Act, where we have reason to think
Congress intended the Court to go about the business of
construing and developing antitrust law.  In fact, they
have kind of taken over for us.  They are imposing
certain limits on when actions can be brought, proposing
particular specific elements.  In one of the provisions,
(e), specifying the SEC can bring an action but
private investors can't.
I mean, we don't get in this business of
implying private rights of action any more.  And isn't
the effort by Congress to legislate a good signal that
they have kind of picked up the ball and they are
running with it and we shouldn't?
MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, this Court, Your Honor,
as recently as 2002 in Wharf (Holdings) said there is a
private right of action for violation of any of the
subdivisions of rule 10b-5:  a, b, or c.  That would
have to be reversed.
Going back to the Superintendent of
Insurance case in, in -- that would be in 1971, Your
Honor, the Court held there was a private right of 1
action for violation of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's kind of
my point.  We did that sort of thing in 1971.  We
haven't done it for quite sometime.
MR. GROSSMAN:  But when Congress enacted
the Private Security Law Reform Act, everything it did
in connection with that statute was directed to the
private right of action that this Court had previously
implied under 10(b).  Nothing that Congress did was
intended in any way --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not -- my
suggestion is not that we should go back and say that
there is no private right of action.  My suggestion is
that we should get out of the business of expanding it,
because Congress has taken over and is legislating in
the area in a way they weren't back when we implied
the right of action under 10(b).
MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I would agree,
Congress has taken it over.  And when they enacted the
Private Security Law Reform Act, they recognized this
private right of action.  Everything they did recognized
the private right of action.  It recognized that there
would be multiple primary violators of 10(b).  It did
that in connection with proportionate liability
provisions.  It recognized that there would be multiple  1
players.
So certainly, Congress had an understanding
of what this Court had done up until that time.  And
this Court up until that time had implied the private
right of action for every subset of rule 10b-5.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it -- is it a
necessary part of your theory that the deceptive
practice that Scientific-Atlanta went in, that they
knew that that was also -- that Charter would carry that
forward?  I mean, let's suppose that there were benefits
to this deceptive practice to Scientific-Atlanta, that
it looked like it had more money to spend on advertising
than it really did, but they didn't care what Charter
did with it.  In fact, they didn't know that Charter was
going to carry it on its books the way they did.  Would
there still be liability for Scientific-Atlanta?
MR. GROSSMAN:  No.  No, not under the test
that we have proposed, which is very similar to the test
proposed by the Ninth Circuit or applied in the Ninth
Circuit in the Simpson case, and the test proposed by
the Securities and Exchange Commission in their amicus
brief submitted in the Simpson case.  It's not enough
to just to have the deceptive act.  The deceptive act for
scheme liability has to be with the purpose of
furthering a scheme to defraud investors. 1
So if Scientific-Atlanta or Motorola had
engaged in deceptive conduct, but that deceptive conduct
was not intended to further a scheme to defraud the
shareholders, no, Your Honor, there would be no action
under the theory that we are pursuing here.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Intended or known?  I mean,
I don't see -- what's in it for Scientific-Atlanta to
defraud the shareholders?  Is it enough that they just
knew it would be used for that purpose?
MR. GROSSMAN:  Oh, it would be enough if
they committed a deceptive act and they knew it was in
furtherance of a scheme.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, when you say "in
furtherance of," you -- you import intent.  They didn't
care what Charter was going to do with it, but they
pretty well knew that what Charter was going to do was
to make its books look better.
Would that be enough?
MR. GROSSMAN:  I think that would be
reckless.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what I thought your
position was.
MR. GROSSMAN:  Yes, but my position is also
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it's not an intent  1
necessarily.  It's just knowledge.
MR. GROSSMAN:  It certainly needs scienter.
You certainly need scienter.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I mean, it's more than
knowledge.  I mean, you mentioned recklessness.  It's got
to have either knowledge of or a willingness to maintain
an indifference to the consequence.
MR. GROSSMAN:  Exactly right, Justice
Souter.  And I think it's important -- and there is a
very -- there is a very good discussion of this in the
Simpson case by the Ninth Circuit, that the purpose of
the test is such that it will not ensnare someone who
does engage in a deceptive act but doesn't understand
that the reason for it is to further a scheme.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure.  After trial -- you
know, after trial which causes your stock to tank, you
may indeed be able to show that you didn't know it was
going to be used for that purpose.  I mean, that's what
this is all about, isn't it, getting it -- getting it by
the summary-judgment stage?
MR. GROSSMAN:  No.  I think, Your Honor,
that this Court answered this last term in the Tellabs
case.  And Congress answered that question that you pose
in the PSLRA, the Private Security Law Reform Act, so
that you cannot just bring a case and hope to get it by 1
the summary-judgment stage.  You have to have
particularized facts alleged under the heightened
pleading standards of the PSLRA and this Court's
decision in Tellabs showing that not only the deceptive
act, but that the purpose of that deceptive act was to
further a scheme.  So, no, you can't just --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What facts -- what has to
be alleged short of -- on information and belief the
defendant knew that -- that this information would
appear on the balance sheets and be used to improve the
status of the stock?
MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, of course if you just
-- if you just allege it on information and belief,
you're out of court.  No doubt about that.  That doesn't
pass the heightened pleading standard in Tellabs or the
PSLRA.  What you do need is what we have here.  Here you
have allegations -- and we didn't make these allegations
from whole cloth -- these allegations were derived
principally from a grand jury -- the Federal grand
jury indictment against Charter executives.  That
indictment says that Respondents were informed and
ordered to deceive Charter's accountants.  They had to
have --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why shouldn't we be
guided by what Congress did in reaction to the Central 1
Bank case?  There we said there's no aiding-and-abetting
liability, Congress amended the statute in 20(e) to say
yes, there is, but private plaintiffs can't sue on that
basis.  Why shouldn't that inform how we further develop
the private action under 10b-5?
MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I think if Congress
intended under 20(e) -- certainly the private actions
similar to this -- it would have said that only the SEC
has the authority to bring a claim for substantial
assistance whether or not it involves deceptive conduct.
They could have very easily said "any deceptive conduct,"
and that would have barred these claims.  They chose not
to do that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But they were --
they were addressing a very specific decision from this
Court, the Central Bank decision.  And the one thing
they did not do is say that that decision was wrong
with respect to private -- or going forward they weren't
going to overrule that decision with respect to private
rights of action.  You're asking us to extend to non --
I know you call it a primary violator, but not the
person who --
MR. GROSSMAN:  Secondary actors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- who put the
deceptive conduct into the market.  You're asking us to 1
extend that liability to them, which seems inconsistent
with Congress's approach in 20(e).
MR. GROSSMAN:  We are not asking any
extension.  Quite the contrary, Your Honor.  I think
that is the Respondents who are asking for a narrowing.
When Congress addressed the PSLRA it addressed all of
the arguments that we are hearing today from Respondents
and their amici.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is your theory dependent on
the proposition that Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola
deceived Arthur Andersen?
MR. GROSSMAN:  That certainly is a large
part of it.  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But didn't you allege
exactly the opposite in your complaint?
MR. GROSSMAN:  No.  We -- I think what
you're referring to is that -- is that the accountants
should have conducted a more diligent audit than they
did.  I mean these people clearly were trying to deceive
the auditors.  Why else would you issue a document
falsely stating a reason for a price increase?
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'm looking at
paragraph 218 of your amended complaint, 109a of the
joint appendix, subsection 4.  It says, speaking of
Arthur Andersen, "though aware that Charter was seeking 1
to boost its revenues by paying vendors higher prices at
the same time it received additional advertising from
the same vendors, Andersen failed to properly audit
these transactions by confirming them with the vendors."
So you alleged that they weren't deceived.  You alleged
that they knew exactly what was going on.
MR. GROSSMAN:  No -- no, Your Honor, they
knew that they were paying the vendors higher prices,
but they didn't know why.  The contract -- the contract
for the higher prices was followed by this misstatement
saying the reason for the higher prices is because of
increased manufacturing expenses, when in fact that
wasn't the reason.  The reason was to take money --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who told -- who told
Charter that it was necessary for them to have a time
spread between the contract -- the $20 above the
contract price and the advertising payment?
MR. GROSSMAN:  Arthur Andersen.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, if it told them
that, didn't it have -- it sounds to me from that that
the accountant says, look, if you want to make this
appear on the balance sheet as though the advertising
revenues were just ordinary advertising revenues, you
better separate these two.  That suggests that Arthur
Andersen knew all along what was going on. 1
MR. GROSSMAN:  No.  Justice Ginsburg, what
Arthur Andersen did not know -- and this is very clear.
They did not know that it was Charter's own money that
was being used by the Respondents to purchase the
advertising.  They were deceived by that document that
said, we are increasing the price on the set-top boxes
because of increased manufacturing expense.  That was
false.  The reason they were increasing it is because
Charter was delivering the money to them.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's exactly the
thing they told them to separate.
MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, not for that reason,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What other reason?
MR. GROSSMAN:  The reason is as follows.
This is what they refer to as barter contracts, two
companies exchanging things, which is perfectly
legitimate, there's nothing wrong with that.  And there
are certain ways to account for it properly, and what
Arthur Andersen was telling Charter was in order to be
able to have revenues included, gross revenues, you have
to have unrelated -- unrelated contracts.  They couldn't
be a barter transaction.  But there is no way -- no way
that you could recognize the advertising revenues if
you're using Charter's own money, and that's what Arthur 1
Andersen did not do.  It would be no different, Justice
Scalia, if Charter delivered a suitcase filled with cash
and gave it to them and said okay, buy the advertising
from us.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand what you're
saying.  It seems to me that when you say that they
can't be connected, you're saying precisely, you can't
be bartering the advertising revenue for the increased
money that you're paying.
MR. GROSSMAN:  No.  You can barter.  You can
barter, it's just a question of how you account for it.
But the bartering is one thing.  I mean, that's one
accounting principle relating to bartering, but there is
no accounting principle that permits the recording of
revenue if you're using the money from the seller.  And
that's why they disguised --
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right, just -- just to
be clear on this -- if Charter and Arthur Andersen and
Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola all sat down and cooked
up this scheme together and they all knew exactly what
was going on, would you have a claim against the
Respondents here?
MR. GROSSMAN:  Yes.  And the reason for
that, Your Honor, is because the advertising contract
was a sham, and the advertising contract was a sham 1
because Charter was giving the Respondents the money to
buy the advertising.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Then I see absolutely no
difference between your test and the elements of aiding
and abetting.
MR. GROSSMAN:  The difference is here we
would have conceptual --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Because you just said that
it's not necessary for there to be an actual deceptive
act on the part of the Respondents.
MR. GROSSMAN:  There has to be a deception
-- there is deception.  The deception is you're entering
into an advertising contract that presents the illusion
that you were purchasing advertising, when in fact you
were not purchasing the advertising.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's -- but
that's not the fraud that was imposed upon the market.
The fraud that was imposed on the market was Charter's
accounting for the transaction on its books.  Nobody
bought or sold stock in reliance upon the way that
Scientific-Atlanta and Charter structured their deal.
They did so in reliance on the way that Charter
communicated its accounting to the marketplace.
MR. GROSSMAN:  There was no way -- no way
that that could properly be accounted for, and the 1
Respondents understood that.  And that's why they did
what they did, that's what --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you're saying --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But there are -- there are
any number of kickbacks and mismanagement and petty
frauds that go on in the business, and business people
know that any publicly held company's shares are going
to be affected by its profits, so I see no limitation to
your -- to your proposal for liability.
MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I think the limitations
are as follows, Your Honor.  Number one, there has to be
the purpose of furthering a scheme to defraud
shareholders.  Number two, the test has an element of
materiality, that it cannot be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I agree with Justice
Scalia's earlier comment, I don't think that
Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola really cared anything of
-- one way or the other about the investors.
MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, that may be that they
didn't care about the investors --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  For them the scheme made a
certain amount of sense, they didn't really care.
MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, they may not have cared,
but that would be reckless because they certainly
understood -- 1
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's far different
from having a purpose.  You said they have to have a
purpose.
MR. GROSSMAN:  That's correct.  If you just
close your eyes -- if somebody comes to you and says,
look, we want you to enter into this transaction, it's a
phony transaction and we don't care -- do whatever you
want with that, and they know it's a publicly held
corporation and they have every reason to understand
that this information --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Which goes back to my
earlier question, that most people that engage in
frauds on business know that if it's a publicly held
corporation, it's going to hurt the price of the shares
or affect the price of the shares.
MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, they shouldn't engage
in schemes to defraud, that's what Congress intended by
section 10.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  But as I understand your
argument, it is the difference between aiding and
abetting liability on the part of the Respondents and
liability as, in effect, as first line principles, is
their intent, or at the very least in knowledge that
they were committing a deceptive act as part of this
scheme.  Is that correct? 1
MR. GROSSMAN:  That they have to commit the
deceptive act --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.
MR. GROSSMAN:  -- with the requisite intent.
That's correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Now, how many times are
parties of the position of Respondents ever going to
engage in those acts except with exactly the state of
mind that on your judgment makes them principals, rather
than aiders and abettors.
MR. GROSSMAN:  It is not on my judgment.  It
has to be pled with the particularity required by the
PSLRA.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  No, I realize that you
have to plead it.  What I'm getting at is:  Are you
making a distinction that in the real world is not a
distinction?  That, in reality, no one is going to do
what these Respondents did without the kind of knowledge
or intent that makes them, on your theory, principals
rather than aiders or abettors?
MR. GROSSMAN:  No, there are cases, I think,
Your Honor, where they can engage in deceptive conduct,
and there would not be the purpose to defraud
shareholders.  For instance, Charter may have come to
them and said look, do me a favor, says the sales 1
manager.  I want to make my numbers for this period so I
can take my wife on a trip to Hawaii that the company
will give me.
So the company gives him a phony order,
thinking that's the purpose of it.  That's the purpose
of the phony order to help this guy along.
Well, you've engaged in a deceptive act.  It
may be deceptive under 10(b), but you wouldn't satisfy
the "purpose" test, because the purpose --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, it's
deceptive but not deceptive in relation to, or for the
purpose of, deceiving the -- someone like the Petitioner.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, wouldn't it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But don't aiders and
abettors have to have that purpose as well?  What
distinguishes -- what distinguishes the liability that
you propose from aider and abettor liability?
MR. GROSSMAN:  You have to engage in a
deceptive act under 10(b).  10(b) prohibits any deceptive
act.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I thought you were telling
me that in each case there may be a deceptive act but
not a deceptive act in relation to somebody like the
Petitioner here.
MR. GROSSMAN:  Exactly. 1
JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that's a different
answer, I think, from the one you were just giving
Justice Scalia.
MR. GROSSMAN:  No.  I -- I understood,
perhaps mistakenly, from Justice Scalia that there
wasn't a deceptive act in your hypothetical.  If there
is a deceptive act, then it's prohibited by 10(b), and
we move to the next statute --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So any aiding-and-abetting
through a deceptive act makes you a principal?  Is that
it?  You can't be an aider and abettor by committing or
enabling a deceptive act without becoming a principal?
MR. GROSSMAN:  No.  Not at all.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You cannot?
MR. GROSSMAN:  You, yourself -- you,
yourself, have to engage in the deceptive act.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
MR. GROSSMAN:  Your own deceptive act.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but -- but if you do,
or if you should have known, you are not an aider and
abettor.  You are automatically a principal.
MR. GROSSMAN:  You may be a principal if you
satisfy the other elements of our test, which are
serious elements that you have to plead with
particularity, with the heightened pleading standards, 1
that they have the purpose to further a scheme to
defraud.  That's very different --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it fair to say that all
aiders and abettors who commit deceptive acts are
principals?
MR. GROSSMAN:  No.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the difference?
What separates the two?
MR. GROSSMAN:  There are tests.  You have
to take it the next step further, because whether or
not that deceptive act had the purpose and effect of
furthering a scheme on investors.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't you need that to be
an aider or abettor?
MR. GROSSMAN:  An aider or abettor?  You
have to have --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If I'm entirely innocent,
and I don't --
MR. GROSSMAN:  An aider -- certainly --
certainly, the primary violator in the situation that we
are discussing where there are deceptive acts is aiding
and abetting.
I mean, if an accountant comes in and
deliberately falsifies a financial statement, he is
giving substantial assistance to the company's statement 1
-- the company who is issuing those false statements.
He would be an aider and abettor in that sense.  He is
also a primary --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You see, I really thought
the difference was that the principal is the one who
makes the deceptive representation and obtains money
from it.  The aider and abettor is the person who
facilitates or enables that deceptive representation,
which is what we have here.
MR. GROSSMAN:  No.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you say if you
facilitate knowingly and intentionally or even grossly
negligently, you are not an aider and abettor, but
you're a principal.  I really don't understand what's
the line between the two.
MR. GROSSMAN:  If you facilitate with a
deceptive act, then you're a primary violator.  That's
what section 10(b) prohibits.  If you facilitate without
a deceptive act, then you are an aider and abettor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Grossman, before you
finish, there is one statement made by the other side
that you are trying to use this -- small in comparison
to all the fraud that was involved here in order to
collect on the entire loss.  That is, you are asserting
that the vendors are liable for the entire loss when 1
they were just a bit player.
MR. GROSSMAN:  Yes.  We are not seeking that
at all, Your Honor.  We -- the PSLRA proportionate
liability provisions govern this with respect to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what are you seeking?
How would you measure your damages?
MR. GROSSMAN:  We would measure the damages,
number one, that flow from this particular scheme.  We
would have to first subtract the settlements that have
been achieved already, and then the proportionate
liability provisions of the PSLRA provide how you make
this determination.
You look at the particular nature of their
conduct, and you look at the extent to which their
particular conduct had a causal relationship with the
damages.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Grossman, I'm
conscious of eating into your time but a question -- how
many chains of this connection can you have?  Let's say
Charter was not a publicly traded company, but same
thing happened with respect to Scientific-Atlanta, and
that made it look valuable to a company that is publicly
traded.  So they decided to buy Charter and then that
made their profits look better to investors.  Can you --
how many chains in the link can you go? 1
MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I -- I think you can go
so long as the person's deceptive conduct has the
purpose of furthering a scheme to defraud.  If they
engage in some deceptive conduct that was not in
furtherance of the scheme to defraud, that's the end of
the chain.  I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
Mr. Grossman.
MR. GROSSMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Shapiro.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SHAPIRO:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
My friend has just asked the Court to expand
an implied cause of action by diluting traditional
requirements such as the reliance requirement and by
eroding this Court's precedent in the Central Bank case.
The Court has said in the past that it must
be very cautious about expanding implied causes of
action, but here there are special reasons for caution.
Expanding the implied cause of action would give
plaintiff the very thing that Congress said it should
not get in section 20(e) of the Exchange Act.
Congress wanted cases like this one to be 1
handled by an expert and disinterested administrative
agency.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's if you equate this
with aiding-and-abetting, and I think the question is is
there a middle category between Charter, who is
clearly primarily liable, and Central Bank, that didn't
do anything deceptive?
MR. SHAPIRO:  The Central Bank case, I
believe, answers that by saying to be a primary violator
you have to satisfy all the prerequisites of 10(b)
liability, including reliance, loss causation, the
"in-connection-with" standard.  And here plaintiffs fail
to meet these tests.  And Congress in 20(e) --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you are saying -- I
thought your argument, unlike the government's argument,
is that there was no deceptive device.  There was no
deceptive device.  They simply aided and abetted.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes.  That's one of the
arguments we make.  It is this case is governed by
Central Bank because the defendant did not use or employ
deception in connection with a securities transaction.
That exactly describes what Charter did.
Now, what exactly describes what the vendors
are alleged to do is what is said in 20(e) -- to
knowingly give substantial assistance to someone else 1
that is misleading an investor.  That fits this case
like a glove --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I thought -- I agree
with Justice Ginsburg.  I thought the "in-connection-with"
argument is actually in addition to or separate from an
additional argument you made that there was no deceptive
statement made here.  I thought that's what you were
arguing, and I have problems with that argument because
the statute doesn't require a statement.  It requires
-- conduct suffice.
MR. SHAPIRO:  We don't make these arguments
without reference to each other.  We think all of these
statutory terms have to be viewed together.  You have to
use deception in connection with securities trading,
which these vendors did not do.  That's what Charter
did.  And --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  You don't defend the
position --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you say that there
was deception, standing alone?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, we have -- we have
suggested that that is not true when you're speaking
with somebody that knows the facts such as Charter.
Charter understood all these facts.  Charter could have
accounted for these transactions correctly, itself.  The 1
vendors did that.  They didn't recognize any revenues
here.  It was up to Charter to account for these
transactions properly.  Congress required it to do that,
so it is the speaker here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But Charter said --
vendors, I need you to consummate this fraud on the
public.  I can't do it without you.  I've got to have
those revenues that you're going to give me through
these phony advertising payments at four or five times
the usual rate.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, we believe even placing
that most pejorative characterization on these facts,
which we don't agree are the true facts, that still --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you must assume that
they are now.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Assuming that they are, that
this is a 20(e) situation where it is alleged that the
vendors gave substantial, knowing assistance to somebody
who was committing a fraud.  And Congress said that an
expert and disinterested administrative agency should
decide whether to proceed, because it is so slippery to
apply these characterizations.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's if they are --
that's if they are aiders and if there are only two
categories and everyone who is not Charter is an aider 1
and abettor, then you're right.  But if there's a middle
category of people who, while not the benefited company
-- the company that's trying to achieve the deception --
but made it possible for that -- for that deception to
happen.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, you know that's an exact
description of Central Bank because there it was alleged
that the trustee entered --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No --
MR. SHAPIRO:  -- into a secret agreement.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In Central Bank, it was
conceded that the bank engaged in no deceptive act.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Here there is the charge
that it did engage in deceptive acts.
MR. SHAPIRO:  What was conceded was that the
bank made no statement to investors, but what was
alleged in the complaint and argued in the briefs was
that the bank entered into a secret side agreement that
enabled the use of a fraudulent prospectus that
unleashed securities that were worthless on investors,
and investors said, we were depending on our trustee to
prevent that from happening.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Now, I take it, though, you
do not defend the position that there must -- for 10(b) 1
liability -- that there must have been a statement
addressed to investors.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, we -- we think that for
reliance purposes, there --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, do you --
MR. SHAPIRO:  -- the defendant has to
communicate with investors.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Would you answer my
question first?  Do you take the position that there can
be no 10(b) liability without a statement addressed to
investors?
MR. SHAPIRO:  It has to be communicated to
the investors and it has to be attributed under the case
law to the speaker.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  You mean the statement as
such or a statement which could not have been made but
for the statements of the Respondents must be
communicated to the investors?  Which one?
MR. SHAPIRO:  That -- that kind of but-for
causation is not sufficient.  That is not reliance.
That kind of --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  So are you -- so you are
saying that there can be no causation and hence, you
know -- and I think you're going further.  You're saying
there can be no liability within the description of 1
(b) unless there is a statement directly addressed to
the investors, is that correct?
MR. SHAPIRO:  That is one of our
submissions, but we also say that the substance of these
statements was never communicated to investors.  Only
Charter --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because the whole purpose
of it --
MR. SHAPIRO:  -- spoke to the investors and
never summarized these.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Shapiro, if --
MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If it was communicated to
investors that there had been $20 per set box over the
regular price, if there had been advertising that was
paid for by the very money that Charter gave, then the
whole thing would have failed.  So this can work only if
the vendors are silent.  Silence and not speech is what
counts.  If the vendors communicate anything at all, the
whole thing fails.
MR. SHAPIRO:  But the -- the communication,
Your Honor, has to be to the market and to investors.
There was no duty to disclose to investors here.  The
only communications the vendors made were "we're raising
our prices 6 percent, the date of our contract is August 1
st, for the simple reason that it started the very
next day” --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was there any --
MR. SHAPIRO:  -- on September 1st."
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was there any economic
substance to this?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, of course.  There was
economic substance from the vendors' perspective.  They
were selling their products at exactly the price that
they wanted to receive for those products and they were
getting some free cooperative advertising thrown in at
the same time.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it true that the price
that they were charging, they did not charge to other
customers -- the $20 hike?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, it's true because they
weren't concerned with that because they weren't paying
for it.  Charter was paying for this cooperative --
cooperative advertising, the reason being --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it was --
MR. SHAPIRO:  -- that Charter had a big
interest.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- a sham then, because
they said the reason they upped the price $20 a box was
they -- the inflationary conditions, so they had to 1
renegotiate the contract, but didn't renegotiate with
any of their other customers.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, Your Honor, from the
vendors' perspective, this was a transaction that
appeared to be a way to increase cooperative
advertising.  It cost the vendors no money.  They were
told by Charter that Arthur Andersen had approved the
transaction.  That's alleged in the Barford indictment.
Then they went home and talked to their own auditors --
how do you account for this unusual transaction?  The
auditors said, you cannot record any revenues from the
transaction.  They didn't record any revenues.  They
expected Charter to do the same thing, to not record
revenues --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but that's --
MR. SHAPIRO: -- if that's what the rules
required.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- that's not the
allegation of the complaint.  I -- I thought the
allegation of the complaint was that they -- they
knew that this was a fraud and they participated in
the fraud.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes, they -- they do allege.
I'm merely pointing out that in the Barford --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I mean that -- so that 1
your answer doesn't seem to be -- get us very far on a
legal point.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, we say that if you take
the complaint at face value and you don't even consider
the Barford indictment that they cite, that it still is
a classic example of knowingly giving substantial
assistance to someone else that is making misstatements
to investors, because these vendors didn't make any
misstatement to investors.  Nobody relied on their sales
correspondence.  It sat in a file drawer until long
after the stock had gone all the way up and come all the
way down.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's the essence of the
scheme.  You said that they -- they are home free
because they didn't themselves make any statement to
investors.  But they set up Charter to make those
statements, to swell its revenues -- revenues that it in
fact didn't have.
MR. SHAPIRO:  But Congress's policy judgment
here is that the SEC, an expert agency that is
impartial, should evaluate a claim of that sort and
decide whether to proceed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's if they are aiders
and abettors, which is what Congress covered.  And I
again go back to, is there another category or is 1
everyone -- either Charter, the person whose stock is at
stake, the company whose stock is at stake and everyone
else is an aider?  I take it that that's your position.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's either the company
whose stock is in question or you're an aider and
abettor.
MR. SHAPIRO:  You are only a primary
violator under -- under Central Bank if each and every
element of 10b-5 liability is satisfied, including
reliance on your statement, including the
"in-connection-with" test, and including loss causation.
None of those tests are satisfied here, but what is
satisfied is section 20(e), which says, did they
knowingly give substantial assistance to somebody who is
committing a fraud?  And that -- that fits this case
like a glove --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If we accept --
MR. SHAPIRO:  -- if Congress wanted the SEC
to address --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If we accept your theory
of the case and we then get another case in which an
accountant or an attorney who prepares the statement for
publication to the investors and then gives it to
Charter, and they are before us, could we find liability 1
under 10b-5 as to the accountants and still rule -- and
still keep our ruling in favor of your client here?
MR. SHAPIRO:  It really depends on --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if so, what would --
MR. SHAPIRO:  -- on the circumstances.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if so, what would be
the rationale?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Some attorneys are control
persons within corporations, and in-house counsel that
drafts the disclosure statement which contains a
falsehood may be liable as in the McConville case, which
the Court recently considered.  Individuals may be
liable --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How about outside
accountants and attorneys who deliberately and directly
participate in negotiating -- or in drafting the false
disclosure statements?
MR. SHAPIRO:  I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could they be liable and
under your theory of the case, but your client not
liable?
MR. SHAPIRO:  It -- it's possible.  Your
Honor, at the end of your --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well what about in this
case?  Let's be specific.  As I understood an earlier 1
answer of yours, the answer was that Arthur Andersen
knew what was going on.  If I've -- if you are -- and
as I understand it, that's not what was charged -- but
if that's correct, Arthur Andersen did know what was
going on.  Can Arthur Andersen be held liable under
b-5 --
MR. SHAPIRO:  Absolutely --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- whereas your client
cannot?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes, sir.  The reason --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  And the difference is?
MR. SHAPIRO:  The reason is they issued
opinions that were circulated to investors, that were
attributed to them and which were authorized by them,
and if a lawyer does the same thing, if Steve Shapiro
writes an opinion letter and circulates it to investors
and it's full of falsehoods --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  But --
MR. SHAPIRO:  -- I can be held liable for
that --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  What if Arthur Andersen --
MR. SHAPIRO:  -- as a speaker.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  What if Arthur Andersen has
a footnote in there saying, this is okay because we have
this -- this letter from I forget which one of the two 1
Respondents it was, saying there's been inflation and
therefore we've got to renegotiate the prices and jack
them up 20 percent, Arthur Andersen knows that that is
false and the Respondent who made it knows that it is
false, can the Respondent who made it then be held
liable?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Only people who speak to the
market --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but doesn't --
MR. SHAPIRO:  -- and induce investor
reliance.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but doesn't -- doesn't
the Respondent in that case know that it is likely that
the auditor is going to indicate the basis for its
statement, that the transaction is okay --
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- and, therefore, isn't it
reasonable to suppose that they anticipated that their
statement would be communicated to the market?
MR. SHAPIRO:  That is just aiding and
abetting, and in fact Congress dealt with that squarely
in section 303 --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  But there's a communication
to the market there --
MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, yes -- 1
JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- and there's a reason to
expect that communication.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Doesn't that make any
difference?
MR. SHAPIRO:  That is not sufficient.
Congress addressed that in section 303 of
Sarbanes-Oxley, and it held that any person -- said any
person including a vendor that misleads an auditor can
be held liable in an SEC proceeding only, not in a
private suit.  It excluded private actions.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is the word "only" in
there?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Pardon me?
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is the word "only" in
there?
MR. SHAPIRO:  The word "exclusively" is in
there --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  In the statute?
MR. SHAPIRO:  -- and my --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  So you have an independent
defense quite apart from -- from the construction of
b-5?
MR. SHAPIRO:  We rely on 20(e) and 303 of
Sarbanes-Oxley, and my friend has made the argument -- 1
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Which I thought speak
about aiders and abettors.
MR. SHAPIRO:  It's talking about an aider
and abettor that misleads an auditor and then --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is usually --
MR. SHAPIRO:  -- the auditor issues a false
certification.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- aider and abettor --
then again we get back to the question:  If there's
nothing in this world other than the company that puts
out the false statement and the aider and abettor --
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well -- oh, no --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- and is there something
in between?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Your Honor, there are other
persons that are control persons within a company who
are liable.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we're taking those out.
We're talking about independent actors.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Independent actors that don't
speak to the markets and cause direct reliance on their
own statements are aiders and abettors.  And they are supposed
to be dealt with by the SEC, an expert agency.
Now, my -- you know, my friend made the
argument about Sarbanes-Oxley that there's a savings  1
clause in that provision that preserves other remedies.
But if you look at the legislative history, it says
explicitly we are preserving SEC remedies.  We want the
SEC to pursue these suits.  And Congress refused in 2002
in Sarbanes-Oxley to reinstate the aiding-and-abetting
private liability cause of action.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you know, Mr. Shapiro,
if in the law of torts and the restatement of torts or
in other areas of the law there is some third
classification that's between aider and abettor in
principle?
MR. SHAPIRO:  I don't know the answer.
Although in these statutes themselves there are such
provisions not included in section 10(b).  For example
in section 18(a), if you cause some other person to make
a false statement in a financial statement, you can be
held liable, but they are not invoking it in section 18.
Same thing under section 17.  If you engage in a scheme
to cause some falsehood, you can be prosecuted by the
government.
But nowhere has Congress said that an
individual litigant can bring a claim like that without
regard for reliance and "in connection with" and the
loss causation test.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let's assume there is 1
reliance and loss causation.  Let me ask a question very
similar to what Justice Ginsburg has posed a couple of
times.  She has said is there a third category.  My
question is, is there an overlap?  Can there be an
overlap?
MR. SHAPIRO:  No, I don't think there can be.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Because Congress intended in
section 20(e) to have an expert agency address these
cases and not to have the trial --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Congress intended an expert
agency to address solely aiding-and-abetting cases.  My
question is if there is an overlap -- A, can there be an
overlap?  And if so, I don't see why Congress's intent to
reserve aiding-and-abetting alone to the agency affects
the determination of this case.
MR. SHAPIRO:  We believe they are separate
categories and that Central Bank tells us exactly who
the primary violator is.  He is somebody who makes a
statement that investors rely on in connection with
securities transactions, and that is not these vendors.
That is exactly what section 20(e) addresses and commits
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could you amend that to
say -- you don't insist that he make a statement that 1
invest -- he could engage in a deceptive practice
directed at investments?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  We
don't quarrel over that, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  For example, for example,
let's assume in this case that Charter said we've, we've
got to let the investors know that our cost of doing
business is going up, and we want to you make an
announcement that you're jacking up your price 20
percent.  In that case there would be primary liability.
MR. SHAPIRO:  Absolutely.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why in that case is there
not also aiding-and-abetting?  We know perfectly well
why they are doing it, and they are doing it solely to
aid and abet Charter in its scheme themselves enjoying
a wash transaction.  Why isn't that both primary and
aiding-and-abetting?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, it's primary because
there is the communication to the market that's missing
here.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  We know it's primary.  Why
isn't it also aiding-and-abetting?
MR. SHAPIRO:  You can call it -- both of
those things.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  If you can call it, why 1
isn't there the kind of overlap which raises the
question that Justice Ginsburg has raised?
MR. SHAPIRO:  You can't have primary
liability, which they are asserting here, without the
statement to the market.  And it can be a statement by
conduct, and it can be by nodding of the head.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  So you are saying there can
be an overlap but there is no overlap that helps the
Petitioner in this case?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, yes.  Nodding the head is
the same thing as saying yes.  But it has to be made
directly to an investor and cause reliance by that
investor.  That's what's missing here.
So there is nothing wrong with the Eighth
Circuit's decision.  It didn't address that refinement,
because it has no bearing on this case.  So there is no
point in reversing the decision.  It has to be affirmed
in our view for want of reliance, for want of loss
causation, for lack of "in connection with", and because
most importantly, Congress intended to remove this
category of case and commit it to an expert agency as
part of its very important reform effort to deal with
excessive litigation that was harming our economy.
This was an important concept for Congress.
And it said it twice:  First in the PSLRA in 1995, then 1
in 2002, in the Sarbanes-Oxley law.  And it removed even
claims that you mislead an auditor under section 303 of
Sarbanes-Oxley.  And there is no savings clause there
for private actions.  Congress refused to permit the
private actions.
Instead, it permitted the SEC to bring
intentional misconduct cases under section 20(e) or
negligent misconduct cases under section 303 or under
section 13.  And the SEC has a broad panoply of
remedies.  It doesn't have to just allege intentional --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does the SEC distinguish
this kind of situation where silence is the essence of
the thing for the deceiver, silence not speech?  Does
the SEC distinguish this from aiding-and-abetting?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, the SEC's view is the
one rejected by the Solicitor General, and that's this
purpose-and-effect standard that's been advocated, which
we think is hopelessly vague.  And it overrides the
reliance requirement.  It overrides the "in connection
with" requirement.  And it overrides loss causation, not
to mention Central Bank.
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Shapiro, what is your
strongest case, in your view, for the reliance
requirement?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Central Bank itself. 1
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Central Bank itself?
MR. SHAPIRO:  Because the Court there
said that even though the bank did something that was a
secret agreement that facilitated the issuer's
distribution of a false prospectus and caused all the
harm to the shareholders, it was a direct sine qua non
cause of all of that harm, that that was merely aiding
and abetting, because there was no reliance on anything
that the bank stated or anything that the bank had a duty
to state because of a fiduciary relationship.
Now, the vendors here are even far more
removed from investors than the bank was in Central
Bank.  The investors knew about the bank in Central
Bank, and they were relying on it to do its job.  But
that was not sufficient because it made no statement
that the investors relied on.  There is no
communication here between these vendors and investors.
There is no way you could --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Shapiro, in your
judgment, is the reliance requirement an element of
the violation or of the private cause of action?
MR. SHAPIRO:  It's the private cause of
action.  An important point, Justice Stevens, because
the SEC is not burdened with any of these elusive
inquiries into but-for causation, speculative questions 1
of indirect reliance; none of that burdens the SEC.
And the SEC also has power to distribute
funds to investors.  This is the better mousetrap that
Congress prescribed for these kinds of cases.  It didn't
want the trial lawyers to bring class actions that
always result in settlements.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
Mr. Shapiro.
MR. SHAPIRO:  We thank the Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Hungar.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HUNGAR:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The court of appeals erred to the extent it
held that section 10(b) applies only to verbal
misrepresentations or omissions.  But the court
correctly held that this Court's decision in Central
Bank forecloses Petitioner's claim here.  Like the
plaintiff in Central Bank, Petitioner cannot establish
reliance, a critical element of the section 10(b)
implied right of action.
Neither Petitioner nor the market relied on 1
or was even aware of any deceptive conduct or statement
by Respondents --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Hungar, I want to be
sure I understand one part of the government's position.
You do take the position that there has a violation of
b-5?
MR. HUNGAR:  We haven't taken a position on
that question, Your Honor.  We take the position that
there was deceptive conduct alleged.  The -- one of the
elements of a 10b-5 violation, but not the only
element.
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Were the other elements
present?
MR. HUNGAR:  As I say, we have not taken --
I mean, materiality, for instance, the "in connection
with" requirement, scienter, we haven't addressed those
questions and have not taken a position.
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you have an opinion as
to whether there was a violation of 10(b) in this case?
MR. HUNGAR:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS:  You don't have an opinion?
MR. HUNGAR:  We haven't taken a position, and
JUSTICE STEVENS:  I know you haven't taken a
position, but I was just wondering if you have an 1
opinion?
(Laughter.)
MR. HUNGAR:  No, Your Honor.  We haven't
addressed the other elements and those -- questions that
we have -- because there is no need to resolve them in
this case and because they weren't resolved by the court
of appeals or by the district court, we have chosen to
focus on what we think is dispositive and what was
raised and decided below, which is reliance.
JUSTICE STEVENS:  You have not reached
opinion as to whether there was a violation of the
statute?
MR. HUNGAR:  Correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Has the SEC publicly taken
a position on that question?
MR. HUNGAR:  I'm not sure of the answer to
that question, Your Honor.  Certainly individual
commissioners have given speeches and testified before
Congress to the effect that the Commission voted in this
case to agree with our position on deception, the
position that's expressed in our brief, and by a
three-to-two vote to disagree with the position on
reliance that is expressed in our brief.  But I don't
know that there has been any official SEC Commission
statement to that effect that's been publicly released. 1
As I said, the only deceptive conduct that
was allegedly committed by Respondents in this case
involves the backdating of contracts and the false
justifications for the price increase.  That conduct was
never disclosed to the market at any time during the
class period, and therefore, could not have been relied
on by the market or by Petitioners.
And as a consequence, under this Court's
decisions in Central Bank and in Basic, reliance cannot
be established because the presumption of reliance that
Petitioner seeks to invoke requires as a prerequisite to
its invocation the existence of a publicly disseminated
statement from the defendant that was disseminated to,
and therefore, relied on by the market.  That did not
happen here with respect to Respondents.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could the SEC get any
monetary recovery for the investors on your theory?  You
say yes, it's a deceptive practice, but this belongs in
the SEC's bailiwick, not in private suits?
MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Private suits; obviously
they are seeking damages for the decline in the share
price.  What could the SEC -- suppose it should take up
this case -- get by way of remedy?
MR. HUNGAR:  The SEC is entitled to obtain 1
civil fines, as well as disgorgement remedies.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is no
disgorgement here because the vendors didn't get
anything.  For them it was a wash.
MR. HUNGAR:  Well, I don't know -- I believe
in the, not in this case but in the Adelphia case, which
is addressed --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, but this case,
disgorgement would not be a remedy.  You say fines,
but those would be payable to the government, right?
MR. HUNGAR:  If I may -- yes, yes and no, I
think is the answer to that question; because under the
fair funds provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, section
8 of Sarbanes-Oxley, the SEC is authorized to take
fines and distribute those -- add those to disgorgement
relief -- and distribute them to investors.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there would be no
disgorgement relief.
MR. HUNGAR:  Well, I'm not sure I can agree
with that point.  In the Adelphia matter --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What profits did the
vendors get?  For them it was a wash.  They got -- what
did they have to disgorge?
MR. HUNGAR:  Well, they obtained -- at least
it appears that they obtained advertising that 1
presumably had some value, although it didn't cost them
anything; and presumably the SEC could seek the value of
that advertising.  As I said, in the Adelphia matter
where the SEC did pursue the vendors that assisted
Adelphia in a somewhat similar transaction, it obtained
substantial monetary recoveries from them.  I --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But did they receive
something that they then disgorged?
MR. HUNGAR:  I believe the allegations were
similar to those presented here.  But in any event,
certainly the SEC has the authority to proceed in that
fashion, and additionally the Justice Department has
the ability to proceed criminally and obtain substantial
monetary sanctions, either as part of a deferred
prosecution agreement, as part of a restitutionary
sanction and the like; but the fundamental point is that
for the private right of action to apply, as this Court
said in Central Bank, all of the elements of the private
cause of action must be satisfied with respect to the
individual defendant.  That is the line.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you agree, do you
agree with Mr. Shapiro, what I understood to be his
argument, that 20(e), the aider and abettor statute,
more or less occupies the field here and there is no
role for additional 10b-5 liability? 1
MR. HUNGAR:  Well, I wouldn't say that it
occupies the field per se, but what it does do is --
given the timing of this Court's decision in Central
Bank in 1994, followed by Congress's considering the
question whether to provide for secondary liability
in private actions, and its decision not to authorize such
secondary liability -- what it does clearly suggest is
that this Court ought not adopt the expansive view of
the implied right of action that Petitioner is urging,
but instead both because the Court is appropriately
cautious in expanding liability under implied rights of
action, and because Congress has now looked at this
question, not once but twice, and has declined to
provide secondary liability for secondary actors under
the cause of action.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You think that you are
either a principal or an aider and abettor?
MR. HUNGAR:  You can -- it's possible for
someone to be both but in order to be both they must
have -- they must have satisfied all of the elements.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  For the same act, I'm
talking about -- for the same act.
MR. HUNGAR:  Yes.  For instance an auditor
who certifies false financial statements and allows
that -- its certification to be, to be publicly 1
disseminated, thereby aiding and assisting in the
issuer's primary fraud, but is also a -- quite likely to
be a primary violator, because they have spoken to the
market.  The market is relying on their statements, and
is aware that they are making them; and so they would be
both a primary violator, but could presumably be pursued
as an aider and abettor.  I don't think there is any
preclusion of liability under both, but in order to be
in that category you must be a primary violator.  And
here, Petitioners have not established and cannot
establish the reliance element with respect to
Respondents, because nothing that Respondents said or
did was disseminated to the market during the class
period.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I take it in your view
they cannot establish the "in connection with"
argument?
MR. HUNGAR:  We have not taken a position --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Prior to the statment,
there is no reliance, but that there is "in connection
with" --
MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, I would hesitate to
say that, Your Honor, because the SEC and the United
States do not have to establish reliance in criminal or
civil enforcement proceedings, but we do have to 1
establish "in connection with," and we think they are
different.  We think reliance adds something more than
what "in connection with" requires, and so I certainly
would urge the Court not to suggest that merely because
reliance is not established, therefore "in connection
with" must not also be established; and that is one of
the reasons why we think that the "in connection with"
question is best resolved, not in this case, but in the
case where it's been squarely presented, and preferably
a government enforcement action where the government
has an opportunity to tailor the case in an appropriate
fashion.
The Court, as I said has been --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's at least a
little awkward for you to say we should wait for a case
in which it's been fully presented when the argument
you're making here wasn't fully presented, or at
least not decided below.
MR. HUNGAR:  I think it was, Your Honor.  It
was certainly briefed and argued in both the district
court and the court of appeals.  The district court
squarely resolved it at page 41a of the petition
appendix.  The court of appeals addressed reliance at
page 10a of the petition appendix.  It did not give it a
fully orbed discussion. 1
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understood the
court of appeals' decision to be based on its
determination that there was no deceptive act because
there was no statement or omission.
MR. HUNGAR:  But on page 10a, they also talk
about reliance, Your Honor; and what's important here to
understand is that Petitioner's theory of reliance
rests on a misstatement, because they say the market
-- it's a basic presumption of reliance based on the
fraud-on-the-market theory case.  That's the only
allegation of reliance in the complaint; that requires
something publicly disseminated.  The only thing that
was publicly disseminated is the statement.  What the
court of appeals said is, that doesn't work, there was
no reliance because Respondents didn't make any publicly
disseminated statement.  So it's actually, perhaps not a
complete, but certainly a perfectly reasonable resolution
of the reliance question; and therefore it is squarely
presented.  Petitioners raised reliance in their petition
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't see --
MR. HUNGAR:  -- at page 25.  In their
opening brief at pages 37 to 40, it's squarely presented
and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm looking at the court 1
of appeals decision which I thought just said that there
was no deceptive device.
MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, on page 10a, the
second line, the first full sentence, speaking of
Motorola and Scientific-Atlanta, "they did not issue
any misstatement relied upon by the investing public,"
and then it goes on the next sentence:  "None of the
alleged financial misrepresentations by Charter was made
by or even with the approval of the vendors," that is
the Respondents.
Again as I say, it's not as complete a
discussion of the reliance issue as we would have
thought appropriate if we had been writing the opinion,
but it certainly does touch on the question and we think
it's wholly presented.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
Mr. Hungar.
Mr. Grossman, have you three minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY M. GROSSMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GROSSMAN:  Thank you.
I -- excuse me, I have three quick points to
make.
One, Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Hungar both said
that the advertising cost the vendors no money.  Well, 1
if the advertising cost them no money, why was there a
contract that they entered into for the purchase of
advertising?  Clearly it was designed to give the false
appearance that Charter had this additional $17 million
in revenue.
Number two, the SEC did take a position in
the Simpson case as it submitted an amicus brief;
Commissioner Cox testified before a House committee this
past spring that they wanted to submit the same brief on
the same points supporting the position that we are
taking here; and the testimony of Commissioner Cox is
appended to the briefs of Congressmen Franks and
Conyers.
Number three, Central Bank did not turn on
reliance.  Central Bank turned on the issue of deceptive
conduct.  There was no deceptive conduct in that case.
The plaintiffs conceded there was no deceptive conduct;
the court of appeals and the district court said there
was no deceptive conduct; it was strictly an aiding-and-
abetting case.
With respect to the reliance issue in
Central Bank, what the Court did say was under
plaintiff's theory he wouldn't have to prove reliance.
He only had to prove that he -- that the defendant
substantially assisted a defendant who engaged in a 1
primary violation, but he would not have to prove any
reliance by the aiding and abettor.
Number three, with respect to 20(e), how do
my friends on the other side read 20(e) in connection
with section 9 and section 18 of the Exchange Act, each
of which provides remedies and private rights of actions
against multiple parties?  Under their definition, that
would appear to be displaced by 20(e).  20(e) was not
designed, it was not intended to do anything but to give
the SEC the right to bring the very type of aiding-and-
abetting action that this Court barred in Central Bank.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
Mr. Grossman.  The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the case in the
