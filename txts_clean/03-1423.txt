Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and
may it please the Court:
At issue in this case is the safety of police
officers when they attempt to execute a search warrant in
an inherently unsafe situation.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I ask one preliminary
question, Mr. Phillips? Do we have before us here any
question at all about qualified immunity?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we do believe that a
qualified immunity issue is bound up with the underlying
merits. It was addressed that way by the Ninth Circuit
because --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it wasn't -- it wasn't in
the questions --
MR. PHILLIPS: This Court --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- on which we granted cert?
MR. PHILLIPS: This Court in Procunier treated
the qualified immunity issue as part and parcel of the
underlying merits of the case and -- and, in fact, skipped
over the question of what 1983 meant in order to address
the qualified immunity issue. And presumably --
JUSTICE BREYER: How -- how --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- the Court could do the same
thing here.
JUSTICE BREYER: How do we do it? It goes right
to the heart of this from you, the qualified immunity
thing, for the reason that if you look at the facts and
circumstances, it sounds to me like a somewhat close
question as to whether the police did or did not exceed
the reasonable bounds -- reasonable bounds.
Now, if it's a close question, you have a jury
verdict against you, and -- and then I think, well, yes,
but I begin to come -- become disturbed if I think of
qualified immunity. I mean, it isn't that clear. So --
so having read through the thing, I -- I preliminarily
start by thinking, well, it could have been excessive
force, I mean, given -- you know, I'm using that in
quotes.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: The jury said it was. Who am I
to say it wasn't --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, this -- this --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- in that situation? But
qualified immunity. So now, what do I do?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, in the first instance, it's
reasonably clear to me that you're not bound by the jury's
determination here. This Court has already --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: We -- don't we have to give
any weight at all to the jury finding there or --
MR. PHILLIPS: With respect to the historical
facts of the case, who did what to whom, of course, you
have -- that -- that's subject to clearly erroneous
review. On the issue of whether or not the conduct at
issue here is reasonable, that's an issue of law or at
least a mixed issue of fact --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, a lot of it may depend on
the --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- and law that this Court has
decided as de novo.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- on the music as to
handcuffing and what did they say and what was the
atmosphere and what was the garage really like and how
risky was it that there be gang members in the outhouses
and -- and all kinds of stuff that you might sense from
the testimony.
MR. PHILLIPS: It -- it seems to me that --
Justice Breyer, that the answer to all of those questions
go to the core of what it means to exercise unquestioned
command of the situation, which is a pure legal standard
that this Court adopted a quarter of a century ago in
Michigan v. Summers. And that's a question of law.
To be sure, there are lots of elements of it,
but what my position would be -- and obviously the
officers' position in this case -- is that in exercising
unquestioned command, you can accept all of the facts as
you've just described them and none of that is excessive
because it doesn't expose anyone to anything other than
what is necessary in order to achieve complete control
under the circumstances in order to ensure the protection
of the individual officers and -- and candidly of the
other individuals who were being -- being detained, all
four of them, under these circumstances.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Have you responded to my
initial question? Have you said all you want to say about
qualified immunity?
MR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice O'Connor. My -- my
basic answer to that is that this Court already addressed
that issue in Procunier. It considered that the qualified
immunity issue was part and parcel of the issue, even
though it hadn't been presented in the question presented,
and indeed, I think in this case it's actually a -- a
stronger argument that qualified immunity is in this case
because that is the way that the Ninth Circuit
specifically addressed the issue. It looked at under
Saucier. It evaluated whether or not qualified immunity
was appropriate and -- and did the two-part test, the
first part being whether it was a constitutional violation
and the second part whether or not it was reasonable under
these particular circumstances.
So if I -- if I cannot persuade you that this is
constitutional, which obviously I -- I hope I can do, it
seems to me absolutely unquestioned that there -- that
what the officers did here under these circumstances were
perfectly reasonable.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is the -- what is
the function of a jury in this case? What does the jury
verdict stand for? And the jury doesn't return a special
verdict and says we find X, Y, and Z. It finds whether
the police exercised excessive force, and that's all we
know from the jury verdict.
Other -- I think what you're saying is that
these cases should go off on summary judgment or even a
demurrer. You assume all the facts as the plaintiff
alleges them and then the Court decides whether that adds
up to unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment.
MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I'm not saying that that
would be true in all cases. I do think in this particular
case you did not need to have a jury verdict. We would
have been prepared to stipulate to the facts as they were
found ultimately and -- and giving the benefit of all of
the inferences to the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: We don't know the fact --
what facts were found because all we have is in the jury
verdict that this was excessive force. Period. That's
all.
MR. PHILLIPS: But that's just a conclusion of
law, Justice Ginsburg. So the -- the facts that you know
are the facts as they're described --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's like was --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- by the respondent's brief.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the defendant negligent.
Is that more or less a conclusion of law? We don't know
in what respect from the jury verdict. And here, were
these police officers acting -- did they use excessive
force.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we know precisely what they
did. They kept her in handcuffs throughout the duration
of the -- of the search. We know that. There's no --
there are no additional claims as to having mistreated her
physically.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Wasn't there a fact issue as
to whether she was handcuffed for -- even for a short
period after the search had been completed?
MR. PHILLIPS: I don't think there is a factual
question like that because I don't think that question was
presented to the jury, and it was certainly not the basis
on which the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict in
this case. There -- there was never an argument made to
the jury that this -- that this extended beyond the -- the
period of the end of the search. The argument that was
made to the jury was that the search should have -- should
have been limited to the room where the suspect was -- was
a resident or that the police should have made a decision
somewhere in the -- before the end of the 2-hour search
that she was no longer a threat to them. And then they
were arguing that -- that it even went a little further in
terms of the timing of it. But they never asked the jury
to find that that 15 minutes was the basis for a Fourth
Amendment violation in its own right.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But if -- but if it made a
difference as a matter of law, what -- what should we
assume about that extra 15 minutes? Do we assume that
they found the facts in the way that the -- a plaintiff
argues them or that you think they are?
MR. PHILLIPS: I think if the jury had been
asked to make that finding, that you -- and -- and the
jury determined that there -- that it was unreasonable,
then I think you'd have to conclude that the 15 minutes
were, in fact -- that it did, in fact, go beyond 15
minutes. I do think there is still a legal issue as to
whether that's de minimis under the circumstances.
But -- but I agree. I mean, obviously there is
a role for the jury's findings, and you have to give them
a certain amount of respect. But on the core questions of
reasonableness and suspicion and whether or not the police
exercised unquestioned command and what those terms mean,
this Court has already decided that in the Fourth
Amendment context it has to decide those issues as a
matter of law to regulate the conduct of all police
officers and not simply do it on the basis of whatever a
particular jury would say in a particular circumstance.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, in doing it as a matter of
law here, should we give consideration to the fact that in
this case, if -- if I remember correctly, one of the
officers testified that had they followed normal protocol,
once they had, I think his phrase was, secured the
building, the -- the main building --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- all of the grounds
actually.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that the whole compound?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: That -- that they would have --
they would have taken off the immediate restraints, and he
wasn't sure why they didn't. We -- do we -- do we
consider that when we're crafting our statement of law as
-- as to what is or is not excessive?
MR. PHILLIPS: I think if this Court could
determine that, as a matter of course, the -- the standard
operating procedures in a particular way, that might
certainly inform the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis.
That -- I think what's important to keep in mind in this
context, though, Justice Souter, is we're talking about
four individuals who are being detained under these
circumstances, and each of them poses a distinct issue for
the police officers under the -- under -- when trying to
decide how best to proceed. One of them had been found
with marijuana in his possession. One of them had been
determined to be an illegal alien, and the other two were
individuals about whom the police knew virtually nothing.
So, you know, is it possible that police
procedure, generally speaking, when you're talking about a
single occupant of the residence, oftentimes concludes
that he can take away -- you can remove the handcuffs?
That may be, although I don't think there's much in the
record here to -- to reflect that.
But what the police said here -- and I think
it's extraordinarily important. Officer Muehler testified
that if something had gone wrong, if either a police
officer had been injured or one of the occupants of that
house had been shot or otherwise harmed as a -- in the
context of executing the search warrant, the first
question that would have been asked is what was the least
that could have been done to prevent those injuries from
occurring. And he said to himself and he said it quite
rightly -- and it's a rule this Court ought to embrace
under the unquestioned command theory of -- of law -- is
that if we keep them in handcuffs through the duration of
a reasonable search, we will make our way through the
search much more rapidly, much more efficiently in order
to minimize the detention and we will eliminate -- and I
mean, literally eliminate -- the entirety of the risk
either to the individuals themselves, the occupants, the
detainees, or to the police under these circumstances.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. I take it you obviously
don't want us to -- to come down with a kind of a finicky
version of -- of excessive force as the touchstone, and I
take it you don't want us to come down with simply a
blanket rule saying that essentially the police can do
anything in -- in restraining occupants so long as it is
not wantonly cruel. Somewhere in between. Do you have a
-- a statement that would be the kernel of the holding
that you want?
MR. PHILLIPS: I'm -- I'm quite comfortable with
the way the Court analyzed it in Michigan v. Summers, that
the officer is not required to evaluate the extent of the
intrusion to be imposed by the seizure. That is, you --
you have a categorical rule that allows you, in the
ordinary course, to do whatever is reasonably necessary in
order to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the facts there, there
were no handcuffs. He -- he was just detained. So --
MR. PHILLIPS: I understand that, and -- but my
-- my position is that handcuffs don't materially affect
the detention under these circumstances other than to
assure what the Court said, which is unquestioned command
of the situation.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- I mean, I don't -- would
-- would you say handcuffs are per se lawful for -- for
purposes of applying Summers?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, but it's important to put
that in context because Summers is a narrow exception to
the -- not an exception. It's a narrow circumstance under
the Fourth Amendment. You have to have a search warrant.
It has to be a validly issued search warrant so that we
know that there has either been a crime that's likely to
be taking place in the premises. It only -- it only
extends to the residents, occupants of the house, and it's
only when the search is for contraband, not just for any
evidence. So, for instance, when the police go the 60th
time to Michael Jackson's estate to go try to find
evidence of whatever is going on there, I don't think it's
reasonable to go in and handcuff Michael Jackson and
anybody else who happens to be on site.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn't -- why is
contraband magical? Wouldn't -- wouldn't your point be
when -- when the reason they're investigating gives cause
to believe that there may be physical danger --
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- from letting people wander
around?
MR. PHILLIPS: -- absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is the case with
contraband, but would be the case for many other reasons
as well.
MR. PHILLIPS: I think the important point here
is that we're talking about guns. These are gangs. These
are guns. This is a circumstance that is inherently more
dangerous than any other circumstance the police are
likely to confront.
JUSTICE BREYER: But would you be happy then
with a holding that says just what you said? We reaffirm
Summers and -- but Summers said special circumstances or
possibly a prolonged detention might lead to a different
conclusion in an unusual case.
And the only verdict part that I think we're
concerned with here -- it was not about four people. It
was one person, Iris Mena, and in respect to Iris Mena,
the jury found that there was a violation of her -- of her
Fourth Amendment rights. And as to her, you could have
found -- you said -- I don't know if you misspoke. You
said it could be more than 15 minutes. In looking at it,
I was certain whether they kept her for 15 minutes more or
more than 15 minutes more, maybe up to an hour more beyond
the time that the search ended and kept her in handcuffs,
both after the time they had secured the place and also
after the time the search ended. Well, that would seem a
basis for the jury's verdict and consistent with Summers.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it -- it could have been a
basis for the jury's verdict if they had, in fact, put the
issue of whether or not they were detained --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. -- Mr. -- but may I
point out that the judge's instructions did put that issue
to the jury at page 203. A police officer is required to
release an individual detained in connection with a lawful
search as soon as the officer's right to conduct the
search ends or the search itself is concluded, whichever
is sooner.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. That -- I understand
that, Justice Stevens, but the point we made in our reply
brief is there's not a shred of evidence in this record
and it was never argued to the jury that this search --
that -- that her detention lasted beyond the period of the
search in this case. Indeed, counsel for the police
officers specifically said in his closing argument, there
is no issue but that she was released at the time of the
-- that when -- as soon as the search was -- was ended,
the -- the warrant was executed.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I wonder why the judge gave
this instruction then.
MR. PHILLIPS: Because -- because what he's --
well, you know, it's a reasonable instruction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why -- why there was --
there was a special verdict of sorts, not a detailed one.
But the two questions, question 5 and question 6, on page
5 of the joint appendix --
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: One question concerns whether
the force was excessive, and the other one is, do you find
that she was detained for a longer period than reasonable?
Those two questions -- my first is a procedural
question. Did counsel for the defendants object to the
jury getting -- those two questions being submitted to the
jury?
MR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Ginsburg. We didn't.
And -- and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it seems to me that the
judge is asking the jury in these questions, one is
whether there was a -- a detention, was force greater than
was reasonable under the circumstances, and whether the
duration was longer than reasonable under the
circumstances.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Justice Ginsburg, you
have to put that in context. The argument of the
plaintiff in this case was that the detention should have
ended at either of two points: after they had completely
cleared the area and made it safe, or alternatively, at
some point after that when they had asked her questions
and determined that she had no particular involvement with
Mr. Romero. Their argument was anything after that was
unreasonable, and that's what the jury certainly found,
was that that was the reasonable break point.
Our argument is that's not consistent with the
notion of unquestioned command and -- and is wrong as a
matter of law. And there is no evidence -- no evidence.
There was no testimony that she was kept for a period
beyond the execution of that search warrant. It's very
important to understand that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying that the --
the mere fact that it -- it went to the jury, even went to
the jury without your objecting to it, does not mean we
have to listen to what the jury said. Is that -- is
that --
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. If it's wrong as a matter
of law, that's -- then that's absolutely right. But there
was no evidence in this case that they kept going. The
only thing he said was, he -- he didn't remember. That
was -- the question was put to the police officer. Was
she kept beyond there? He said he didn't remember. He
wasn't even the police officer who was involved in it.
There's not a shred of evidence of that. It's totally
made up. It wasn't their theory of the case in front of
the jury.
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You might save your time.
Yes.
Mr. Shanmugam.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and
may it please the Court:
When executing a search warrant to investigate a
violent crime, officers may routinely use reasonable
restraints on detained occupants in order to exercise
unquestioned command over the situation and to facilitate
the orderly completion of the search.
The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the
officers' use of handcuffs in this case violated the
Fourth Amendment.
Under the standard for excessive force claims
first articulated by this Court in Graham v. Connor, as
informed by this Court's decision in Michigan v. Summers,
the degree of force used here was not excessive. The same
considerations that justified the detention of the
occupants in Summers, most notably, the paramount concern
of ensuring the safety of the officers and the occupants
themselves, will ordinarily justify the precautionary use
of handcuffs during the detention.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then this case should not
have gone to the jury on the basis of what you said --
MR. SHANMUGAM: We --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because you -- you just
said that this -- the handcuffs -- the circumstances --
the circumstances here were reasonable as a matter of law.
MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Ginsburg, that's
correct. It is our view that as a matter of law, the
officers would have been entitled to prevail on the
constitutional issue with regard to excessive force. And
it's worth noting, I think, that the officers did move for
summary judgment. They also orally moved for judgment as
a matter of law at the close of the evidence, and that
motion was denied.
Now, we also believe that the jury, quite
frankly, was given insufficient guidance on the excessive
force issue, and to turn to the jury instruction cited by
Justice Stevens at page 203, it's quite clear that the
jury only received one very general instruction on Summers
detentions.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, has the -- the
objection to the instruction been preserved here?
MR. SHANMUGAM: Perhaps an argument could be
made that it's fairly included within the questions
presented. There was an objection made at trial and an
objection made before the Ninth Circuit as well, but our
fundamental position is that the jury was simply given
insufficient guidance on the excessive force issue. This
instruction --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But on the -- on the question
whether they preserved the issue, I -- I took it, implicit
in what you said a minute ago, that yes, they did not
object to the submission of the question. They did not
object, in effect, to an instruction or giving of an
instruction as such.
MR. SHANMUGAM: That's correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But they -- they had moved for
judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the
evidence, and that's enough to preserve the issue?
MR. SHANMUGAM: I think that's true. It is true
that they didn't object to the specific special verdict
set of questions. I think they proposed slightly
different language. But ultimately I think our primary
submission is that as a matter of law on these facts, no
constitutional violation occurred.
JUSTICE SCALIA: When you -- is your objection
that the jury wasn't given enough guidance on excessive
force, or is it that the -- that the ultimate issue of
excessive force is not a jury issue?
MR. SHANMUGAM: We would concede, I think,
Justice Scalia, that the issue should go to the jury where
there are disputed issues of historical fact. We would
submit that there are no relevant --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but is -- is excessive
force an issue of historical fact any more than -- than
unreasonable search or unreasonable seizure is an issue of
historical fact?
MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there are certain --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's historical fact how long
you held the person, whether the person was in handcuffs,
but the ultimate question was, you know, is this force
excessive. Is that any different from the question as --
of was this seizure unreasonable? If you submit the one
to the jury, you may as well submit the other.
MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Scalia, those facts may
be disputed in a particular case. We would submit that
they really weren't disputed here, but there may actually
be a dispute where the officers would say, yes, we used
handcuffs and the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So when --
MR. SHANMUGAM: -- or no we didn't use
handcuffs.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- when you know all those
facts, you're willing to send it to the jury to say, given
all of these facts, it's up to you to decide whether
unreasonable force was used or not.
MR. SHANMUGAM: We believe that it is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a matter of law.
MR. SHANMUGAM: -- a mixed question of fact and
law, and once the historical facts are established, it is
essentially --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why any more so -- why
any -- any more so than -- than whether it's an
unreasonable seizure?
MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we would submit that it is
no different from the question whether officers had
probable cause or reasonable suspicion on any given set of
historical facts which this Court held in Ornelas was a
question subject to de novo review, over your dissent,
admittedly. And we believe that the primary rationale for
the rule in Ornelas also applies here, namely that
officers do need to have a consistent set of substantive
guidelines by which they can judge the validity of their
conduct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are -- are you saying that the
only basis on -- on which the jury could have ruled for
the homeowner here, the -- the respondent, is that she was
handcuffed for too long?
MR. SHANMUGAM: We believe that that certainly
is the primary issue that was at stake. And in fact --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think you have to say
that. Otherwise, we have to uphold the jury verdict, if
we can assume that the jury might have thought, well, you
know, the handcuffs -- the police had a right to do that,
but she was held too long, she was -- they -- they yelled
at her, she was taken into a -- a place that was
uncomfortable. If -- if that's true, then we have to
sustain the jury verdict.
MR. SHANMUGAM: I think that the handcuffing was
the key factor at trial, and I think that the best
evidence of that, quite frankly, is that respondent in her
proposed instructions referred only to handcuffing in her
excessive force instruction. Unfortunately, that's not
part of the joint appendix. It is part of the record.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. But the instruction
that was given -- and one was read that's in the briefs --
it seems to me a -- a perfectly good instruction.
MR. SHANMUGAM: I think that that's true, but I
think that the instruction didn't really provide any
guidance on excessive force specifically. It was really
an instruction with regard to the reasonableness of the
detention more generally, rather than with regard to
excessive force specifically. It was not a Graham v.
Connor type instruction.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then it seems to me it
was the plaintiff's obligation to submit a clarifying
instruction and to bring this -- the denial of that
instruction here.
MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there were objections to
the instruction below, and all I can say is that perhaps
an argument could be made -- and perhaps Mr. Phillips will
make the argument on rebuttal -- that it is fairly
included within the questions presented.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know how you can --
you can say that the only thing that was before the jury
was the handcuff when the -- there was evidence that she
was treated very roughly in -- in the first instance, she
was woken from her sleep, she wasn't told that they were
police, she thought they were robbers, and she feared for
her life. That doesn't drop out of the case and what the
jury was asked to determine.
MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Ginsburg, it was the
primary issue before the jury, and to be sure, there were
other issues. I think that the other relevant use of
force was the initial detention at gunpoint, but -- and
those -- and I would add that those are the two factors on
which the Ninth Circuit relied in affirming the jury's
verdict. Our submission is that both with regard to the
initial use of force and with regard to the continued use
of force, the justifications of Graham v. Connor support
the officers' use of force in both instances.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but may I just ask a
sort of very basic question? One of the instructions
reads, a detention may be unreasonable if it -- if it is
unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or if it
involves an undue invasion of privacy. Now, are you
telling us that you think the answer to that question is a
question of law that the judge should provide rather than
the jury?
MR. SHANMUGAM: Assuming that that instruction
is correct -- and that might very well be a valid
instruction --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it was correct.
MR. SHANMUGAM: It may very well be a correct
instruction --
JUSTICE STEVENS: All right.
MR. SHANMUGAM: -- with regard to a challenge to
the manner of the detention itself. In that instance,
then the jury does have a certain amount of leeway, but I
think even then the teaching of Ornelas --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Then it's not a question of
law. The answer to whether it was unnecessarily painful,
degrading, prolonged, or involved undue invasion of
privacy, is that a question of law or a question of fact
to the jury?
MR. SHANMUGAM: It is a mixed question of law
and fact, and the jury's job is --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It's a mixed question?
MR. SHANMUGAM: The jury's job is to -- to
resolve the underlying factual issues and then --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand the
historical fact, but I'm -- I'm questioning you about the
conclusions that you draw from the unreasonableness,
degrading, and so forth. Is that partly to be decided by
the jury or entirely by the judge?
MR. SHANMUGAM: We believe that that actually is
ultimately a judge issue in the same way that the issue of
whether or not probable --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So this instruction should not
have been given.
MR. SHANMUGAM: That's correct --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought your position was
that it -- it may be submitted to the jury, but that it
may be reviewed as a question of law simply because that's
the way we are able to set standards for later cases.
MR. SHANMUGAM: I think that's exactly right,
and I think that that is the teaching of Ornelas. And it
may very well be that a more specific instruction should
have been given so as to make clear that the jury had
specific issues of historical fact to resolve. But
ultimately we do believe that it's a question of law in
the sense that it should be reviewed de novo for precisely
the reasons given in Ornelas.
And if I could just say a couple words on the
substantive issue of excessive force. We believe that in
cases involving violent crimes, officers should routinely
be allowed to use handcuffs. In this case, I would just
add that there were several additional case-specific
factors that justified the use of handcuffs. In addition
to the fact that this was a violent crime, the officers
had reason to believe that at least one and possibly two
members of a violent gang were living at the house. In
addition, the officers had previously visited the house on
two occasions to investigate other violent crimes and had
encountered resistance on at least one of those occasions.
And our fundamental problem with the Ninth
Circuit's rule is that it seems to suggest that officers
in the course of a detention should really stop and
investigate whether or not each -- each individual that
they encounter poses a safety threat. And we believe that
that rule is as unworkable as it is unwise. It would
effectively divert officers from the primary task at hand
and could perversely have the effect of prolonging rather
than expediting the completion of the search. And for
that reason, we believe that the Ninth Circuit's rule, its
substantive constitutional rule, was erroneous.
JUSTICE STEVENS: How long did it take them to
find out whether the -- these other dangerous people were
there?
MR. SHANMUGAM: To find out whether?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Whether the people they were
afraid of were -- were on the premises?
MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, you know, I don't know
that they ever actually made a -- a determination other
than that Mr. Romero was not on the premises. I think
they figured that out once they had actually identified
each of the individuals, which was fairly early on in the
detention.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.
Mr. Hoffman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. HOFFMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HOFFMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please
the Court:
Let me start on the issue of -- that Mr.
Phillips said we made up. Actually we didn't make it up.
The claim that Ms. Mena was detained past the time of the
search was made throughout the case. If you look at
footnote 3 in the Ninth Circuit opinion in 2000, the issue
of the length of the detention was a factual issue that
precluded summary judgment. Ms. Mena claimed that the
detention lasted for 2 to 3 hours. The officers claimed
that it lasted 90 minutes.
But more than that, the -- the jury -- the --
the special verdict asked the jury to find whether Ms.
Mena had been kept for a longer time than reasonable, and
in fact, in the closing argument, it was argued that Ms.
Mena had been kept beyond the time that the search ended.
And not only is there not any -- not only is
there evidence in the record, there is overwhelming
evidence in the record that Ms. Mena was kept for a period
of time, at least 30 minutes, give or take, and possibly
as long as an hour. And this is not based on Ms. Mena's
testimony.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you find that the -- that
the -- do you define the end of the search as before they
started videotaping everything they had done?
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, they were videotaping during
the course of the search. But if I can go through the
facts which might clarify things.
Officer Muehler, who was the officer in overall
charge of the -- of the search, testified at trial that
the search ended at 8:40 a.m. Officer Brill said a little
bit later than that. He tied -- but there's a second
video. There are two videos. The second video is from
:50 to 8:57. At the time that the second -- the second
video started at 8:50, Officer Brill testified that the
search was over. The -- the evidence log -- the last
entry on the evidence log is 8:45 in terms of evidence
being logged into the -- into the case.
Officer Brill testified that Ms. Mena was kept
for at least 10 or 15 minutes after the end of the second
video and her handcuffs were not released until she was
brought back around from the -- the separate converted
garage back into the house and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is that
testimony?
MR. HOFFMAN: The testimony -- Officer Brill's
testimony? Is actually -- they cite joint appendix number
-- on 75 where he says he doesn't recall. On the next
page, in joint appendix number 76, he's asked -- they
continue to ask the question. And isn't it your memory
that about 10 or 15 minutes after that, Iris Mena was
released? That would sound consistent. And that's 10 or
minutes after 8:57.
In addition, Ms. Mena testified that she was
kept between 2 or 3 hours, and that was actually
consistent with prior testimony by the videographer
herself, who testified in deposition and was impeached at
trial, that it was 2 or 3 hours that the search lasted.
The -- the point being -- and if you take the
distance between Officer Muehler's testimony and Officer
Brill's testimony, Ms. Mena was -- was kept in handcuffs
at the end of a very long detention in handcuffs, for a
period of approximately 27 to 33 minutes, if you don't
even take Ms. Mena's testimony into account.
And one of the ironies of the case is that
there's testimony that Mr. Romero, the actual target of
the case, was released at 8:45 at the time the search
ended. And so while this --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not from these premises.
MR. HOFFMAN: No. But in fact, this was a --
the search warrant was for two premises. He was picked up
at his mother's house. And in fact, Officer Muehler had
-- was -- was to radio the start of both searches, and so
there was --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the -- I thought
that this poorhouse, or whatever it was called -- that the
warrant covered weapons that were there.
MR. HOFFMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That they were looking for
weapons.
MR. HOFFMAN: They were looking for a gun.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They were not looking for a
gun at Romero's mother's house, were they?
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they have a warrant, a
search warrant?
MR. HOFFMAN: I think the warrant covered -- I
think they were looking for the gun wherever it was found,
and -- and the -- I believe the warrant --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this was a -- this was
a pretty extensive search warrant that they had.
MR. HOFFMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they have something like
that, the same kind of warrant for the --
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, it's the same warrant I
believe, Your Honor, in terms of -- we don't have --
there's not a lot of information in the record about --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, wasn't -- I thought
that this warrant referred to a particular address, a
particular house, not -- not any house where one might
find Romero.
MR. HOFFMAN: No, no, no. It -- it referred to
the two houses, one on Cimmaron.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, was the other house his
mother's house?
MR. HOFFMAN: Yes. The location number one is
his mother's house, 2646 Cimmaron, and that's -- and
Officer Muehler and this team was in charge of both of
these searches pursuant to the same warrant. They had
information that -- the reason they did that is that they
had information that -- that he lived in this poorhouse,
that he rented a room from the Menas at the poorhouse, and
that he also visited his -- his mother from time to time.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then that would make it even
more curious if the place where the dangerous man was
wasn't searched extensively and -- and the mother --
nobody was put in handcuffs, and yet for this -- they knew
pretty soon that Romero wasn't on the premises.
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, they knew right away.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. And that's, I guess,
your -- your point, that the place where the dangerous man
was is not --
MR. HOFFMAN: I think that that explains one of
the reasons why the jury imposed punitive damages here
because they -- they knew that at 8:45, at the time that
Officer Muehler said that the search was over and all the
officers were out of the house and -- and everything was
done, that Mr. Romero was cited and released for marijuana
possession. And at the same time, from 8:45 until
sometime after 9 o'clock, probably as long as 30, maybe
longer, Iris Mena was sitting in a cold, damp, converted
garage with her hands behind her back.
JUSTICE BREYER: You might be able to keep your
verdict, I -- I think. But I think the problem here is
the Ninth Circuit -- you go to the Ninth Circuit and you
say, you know, there was excessive force here on anybody's
definition for reasons that you say. And -- and the Ninth
Circuit says, oh, it was a clear violation of the
Constitution and we'll tell you why, and then they give
some reasons. And two of those reasons are, A, four and a
half pages written the reason that this was
unconstitutional is because they asked her questions about
her immigration status, which you -- I don't think you
even raised. Maybe you did. But anyway, that's -- that's
the bulk of the -- of -- of -- that's the bulk of the
analysis.
And -- and these are the words that I think
they're objecting to. And by any standard of
reasonableness, Mena was -- the -- the officers should
have released her from the handcuffs when it became clear
that she posed no immediate threat. And that was long
before the -- the -- because she wasn't a threat. And
that was long before the end of the search.
And what their point is on that is, you know, if
that's the rule, that's going to interfere with our SWAT
teams because they can't operate that way. They -- they
can't evaluate the individual. They put the individual --
if there are guns and gangs and danger that she'll grab a
gun, they put her in handcuffs, and they hold her there
for the search for a couple of hours, then they release
her. Now, that's their argument.
So they're objecting not so much to -- to the
fact they have to pay $30,000 -- or they may object to
that. But they're -- they're objecting to the holding of
the Ninth Circuit, and if they're right on that, then I
guess we have to send it back and say, do this over again,
though I'll be sorry about that and maybe there is a way
not to do it.
But -- but I want to know your view of what I
see as those two issues here, that the Ninth Circuit's
analysis was wrong.
MR. HOFFMAN: Yes. I mean, first of all, I'd --
I'd say that the -- the Court could affirm the judgment in
this case and the verdict in this case on the ground that
we --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but then we can't really
reach the issue. That's a possibility. I see that.
MR. HOFFMAN: And in fact -- and I -- I think
that would be the appropriate thing to do.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but then suppose that the
reason that this case is here is because of the
implications --
MR. HOFFMAN: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- of the Ninth Circuit's
analysis --
MR. HOFFMAN: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- not necessarily the extra 30
minutes because I see your point on the extra 30 minutes.
MR. HOFFMAN: I think -- I think that there -- I
would divide my response to that, Justice Breyer, into two
parts really. On the questioning issue, I would just say
that that -- that was not an issue that was presented to
the jury for its verdict as a separate Fourth Amendment
violation. It wasn't. And we didn't argue it in the
Ninth Circuit.
What we did -- we did say in our -- in our brief
to the Ninth Circuit that she was questioned about her
immigration status about an issue that was unrelated to --
to Summers detention. We did say that.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we could say is their
opinion -- that's their opinion. It's beside the point,
et cetera.
MR. HOFFMAN: Right. So, I mean, I -- I think
on questioning, you know, we -- we haven't been pushing
that issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if two of the reasons
that the Ninth Circuit gave are in our view incorrect, why
wouldn't we reverse and remand for them to do it without
-- to make the judgment without taking those two factors
into account?
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think what -- first of
all, it's a separate alternative holding. What they said
is that there was a separate Fourth Amendment violation
while they affirmed on the basis that we actually won on.
The jury found that she had been detained longer than was
reasonable and with more force than was reasonable. This
is a jury verdict. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that.
And we've argued in our brief that if the Court
did something on questioning, it would really be issuing
an advisory opinion in this -- in this situation. And,
you know, we've -- we've argued the point and we're
prepared certainly to argue about the merits of that
question because it's obviously an important question. In
our view, the questioning issue should be governed by the
more traditional Terry kind of idea that you can't
question when it goes beyond the scope of the limited
purposes of the intrusion, but we also understand that
that's contested.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- well, it does seem to me
that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it does seem -- seem to
me that the Ninth Circuit's opinion is questionable on --
on this key point of when she had to be released. The
officers should have released her when it became clear she
posed no immediate threat and did not resist arrest.
MR. HOFFMAN: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that is critical to
its holding.
MR. HOFFMAN: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that implies that they
have a -- a duty at the outset to determine whether --
what her status is rather than to go around looking for
guns and -- and to secure the premises. That's -- that's
one of my concerns with that.
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I would have a different
position on that. First of all, I think that the judgment
can actually be affirmed on the first ground regardless of
this issue because it was a -- a jury verdict and -- and
the damages were asked for either/or in terms of question
or 6.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the first ground being?
Just an unreasonably long --
MR. HOFFMAN: Detained beyond the -- the length
of the search. And so I think technically the judgment
can be affirmed on that ground.
But with respect to the handcuffing, the
position that we would say is that, first of all, you --
you would have to view the facts in the light most
favorable to the verdict. Now, it's been -- there's been
a lot of questioning about what that means and what the
jury's role is. As we understand it, if Ornelas applies
to this decision, which we assume the Court would do --
and that is, that you would first have to take the light
-- all the facts in the light most favorable to the
verdict, including the possibility that the -- the jury
rejected as being incredible the statements that the
officers made in terms of justification, if there was
evidence in the record to show that there was
contradicting evidence, which there is in this record.
And so the facts that -- that the other side has tried to
argue are the facts on which you would make that
constitutional decision are not the facts in the light
most favorable to the verdict.
In the light most favorable to the verdict,
there was -- there was lots of planning. There was a
tactical plan in writing that the jury got to see, which
said that the -- the plan here was to go in and make the
SWAT entry, to see if there were non-suspects there. They
would be patted down, identified, and released. The jury
was entitled not to believe the other side's claim that
they didn't say when they were going to be released and
believed that the plan was to release them as soon as it
was ascertained that they did not have the connection in
-- in the situation. And in fact, there's testimony from
the officers that they knew that they weren't gang members
and they knew that they weren't connected to the crime.
And they were completely cooperative, and they didn't
resist arrest and they didn't flee. And Iris Mena is 5
foot 1 -- 5 foot 2 inches, and the jury had a videotape of
exactly how they looked.
The officers had a total plan. They -- they
exercised their command of the situation from the
beginning. They cleared it. They made sure it was safe.
They took people outside through the pouring rain, which
actually they say there wasn't evidence about that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Medium -- medium rain.
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, actually at -- at joint
appendix number 183, Officer Allegra, who was one of the
entry team, said it was pouring. So -- and in fact, the
stipulation of facts said it was heavy. So Iris Mena was
being -- was being demure when she talked about that. You
can even see the rain on the videotape.
And so they took her outside. They took all of
them outside. They put them in this little room, which is
not connected to the house. They had one or two armed
officers outside. There was no place for them to go.
They couldn't interfere with the facilitation of the
search because they were in this room. They couldn't flee
because there's only one way out, a door. There were two
armed guards there. And -- and if all they had to do was
sit these four people, who were not connected to any gang
activity, as to which they had no suspicion ever developed
that they had any connection to Mr. Romero, who had
already been arrested at his mom's house --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They can't have a flat rule
that while you're conducting a search, you -- you can
restrain anybody that you find assuming the search is for
a crime that -- that involves violence.
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think that the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want to have to make
that call all the time, you know.
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, but -- but officers do make
that call all the time. They make it in the context of
Terry stops. They make it in the context of lots of
Fourth Amendment issues.
In Summers -- in Summers, the man was detained.
In many of the post-Summers cases, including many cited by
the other side and the Government, handcuffing is not
viewed as routine. Handcuffing is viewed as something
that substantially aggravates the nature of the seizure --
JUSTICE BREYER: If that's true, is it routine
in -- I mean, here what sort of pushes the other way on
this is this is a dangerous gang. They have lots of
weapons and they have previously gone to this house, which
I gather -- sometimes when I read it, I think it's like a
warren of little rooms. On the other hand, maybe it
isn't. I haven't seen the house. There are a lot of
buildings around, and they think a lot of people here --
we don't know who's what, and we make a mistake in this
and we're dead. You know, I mean, so that's painting it
the other way.
But where you have guns and -- and houses and
gangs and so forth, now that's why they say that it's
reasonable in those circumstances to say, when we find
someone in the house, we handcuff them through the search.
We might let them go earlier, but that's up to us and we
don't want the courts second guessing us on that.
Now, what's -- what's painting it their way, and
I'd like you to respond.
MR. HOFFMAN: I -- I understand that. I guess
the -- the problem with that is that that means that no
matter who they find -- and in this case is a good example
of it. They were worried that they might find the gang
member who had a gun there, and that's what they were
looking for. Okay. And so they used the SWAT team. That
seems perfectly reasonable that they would use a SWAT team
the way they did. And they went in and within literally 4
or 5 minutes, they had -- this is a tiny, little house.
They had cleared the house. They had figured out all the
occupants. They put them in a room completely under their
control where they couldn't get away from anything. They
knew there were two 40-year-old people, a young hippie,
and -- and an 18-year-old girl that was 5 foot --
JUSTICE BREYER: Did they search that room?
MR. HOFFMAN: Yes. They searched that room. So
the room was searched before they went there. They
searched all the rooms. They searched Ms. Mena's room and
found absolutely nothing there.
And -- and the testimony -- and this goes to
Justice Souter's question.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Did they -- did they search the
individuals too to make sure --
MR. HOFFMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I assume they did.
MR. HOFFMAN: Oh, yes. They -- they searched
the individuals. They -- they -- you know, they
completely made sure that -- that when they put them in
that back room, there was nothing in the room. There was
nothing on the individuals. There was nothing that --
that could cause them danger.
And -- and the jury, I think, was entitled to --
to look at those facts and -- and to hear the facts and to
see the facts --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: How did the qualified
immunity question get resolved here?
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, the --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And what -- what role did
that play in all of this?
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, at the -- at the district
court level, the -- the district court heard a rule 59.
But one of the things about this case is it was tried
right around the time that Saucier v. Katz came out, and
in the Ninth Circuit, there was a question about who got
to decide qualified immunity. This was June 2001
actually. And so there was a rule 59 motion about whether
the proper standard of qualified immunity had been
applied.
The district judge, looking at the facts, found
that there were facts to sustain the verdict, including
evidence that Ms. Mena had been kept after the end of the
search. The district judge found that. And then in -- in
the Ninth Circuit, of course, the Ninth Circuit's
published opinion deals with qualified immunity on both of
these issues.
And basically the -- the qualified immunity --
on the -- on the over-detention claim, I think they've
conceded that there just isn't any justification for -- I
mean, a de minimis exception doesn't extend to 30 minutes.
I mean, that -- this Court has debated whether 15 or 20 is
too long on a -- on a Terry stop when there's actually
reasonable suspicion. Here, there's nothing to hold her.
With respect to the handcuffing issue --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it clear that it was 30?
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think in viewing the light
most favorable to the verdict, I think the Court has to
assume that -- that the jury could have found an hour.
But what I'm saying is based on the officer's own
testimony alone, viewed in the light most favorable to the
verdict, it's at least 27 to 32. And so you've got
something that just could not possibly be considered de
minimis under any kind of exception.
And -- and that's why they fought it on the
facts. They haven't even made an argument on the law at
any point in this.
And with respect to handcuffing, I think our
position on the handcuffing is that Summers, first of all,
doesn't deal with handcuffing. And the other side has
consistently tried to equate detention with restraint.
And I think what -- what Summers indicated was that this
Court was willing to allow people to be detained during
the course of a search for three specific reasons. And
when balancing the nature of the intrusion against the
justifications, this Court specifically said it was
endorsing a limited intrusion, and that it wouldn't be
very much different asking someone to sit around --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Doesn't that just go to the
point that it's not clearly established at least?
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, no. I -- I don't think that
is the case, Justice Kennedy, because in -- in -- Summers
doesn't authorize what they did. Graham certainly talks
about having to justify force based on a -- on a Fourth
Amendment analysis. And Franklin v. Foxworth, which is a
Ninth Circuit case that happened before this case, the
Court, first of all, used the -- the analysis that we have
argued is appropriate based on Summers and Graham to
decide that a particular Summers detention was carried out
in an unreasonable manner.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that was ill
individual, a single individual --
MR. HOFFMAN: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- unclothed, et cetera --
MR. HOFFMAN: No. I -- I understand that the
facts were more egregious, but the -- the Court's analysis
for a reasonable officer from a qualified immunity
standpoint -- for a reasonable officer reading that
opinion, you draw at least three conclusions I think. One
is that the proper analysis to determine whether
handcuffing or some additional form of restraint is -- is
allowed has to be decided under the kinds of
justifications that Summers provides and under a Graham
analysis when it comes to force. And there's lots of
cases that -- that allow officers to do that. Lots of
lower court cases. In fact, our view is all the lower
court cases follow that kind of analysis and just come out
differently depending on the facts and circumstances
confronted.
The second thing, the -- the point about the
disabled person and the particular facts made that case
particularly egregious, and the Ninth Circuit said those
were additional factors, not the line. The Ninth Circuit
didn't say that the constitutional standard was
particularly abusive or egregious. It -- it applied
traditional Fourth Amendment analysis.
And finally and I think very important and not
dealt with maybe in the briefs as much as it should be is
that the Ninth Circuit in -- in Franklin rejected a
blanket handcuffing policy. That's what the policy was in
Portland. The Portland police department had a policy
that said you are to handcuff everybody until the search
is over. And the Ninth Circuit said you can't have that
kind of policy because Summers and -- and Graham require
it to be individualized justification for that -- for an
additional intrusion beyond the limited intrusion that's
allowed in Summers.
And in fact, in Summers, the Court went out of
its way to say to compare with what the Court was allowing
to what it -- to -- to the circumstances in Dunaway, to --
to circumstances that start to look like an arrest. And I
don't know how much more intrusive you could be than what
these officers did to Iris Mena, and I think that's one of
the -- the issues here. If -- if the --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And what do we do if we think
the Ninth Circuit was off base in -- in whether Mena could
be questioned about her immigration status?
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I -- I think that --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That seemed to be an
important part of the Ninth Circuit's rule.
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, it's certainly -- it's
certainly an alternative ground. It's not -- it doesn't
affect, I think, our verdict. And so I think what -- I
mean, I suppose the Court could dismiss that question as
improvidently granted, could say to the court that it --
that it should reverse that part of the ruling.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It might be useful to say
they were wrong in --
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, that -- you -- you could say
that. I mean, I would -- on the merits of the question, I
-- I would like to -- if we were reaching that, I would
argue that the Ninth Circuit -- that -- that there is --
there should be a limit on questioning in a -- in a
Summers detention, and the Court should apply the kind of
Terry analysis that the majority of the -- the circuits
apply.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what will do if we
thought the Ninth Circuit was egregiously wrong on that
and that its opinion was, to use the most polite word,
disingenuous when it talked about a garage? That -- that
was somewhat off-putting to me when it was a converted
garage with a bed.
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I mean --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I -- I thought this
woman was standing in -- by some grease rack or something
and she was --
MR. HOFFMAN: She wasn't standing by a grease
rack, but she was made to sit initially by an open door
because the door had basically been obliterated on a very
cold, rainy February morning where she was very cold, and
after -- and had been taken through the -- the pouring
rain in bare feet and with only a T-shirt and was left
there for at least 20 or so minutes without being given a
coat or shoes. And she was made to sit by there and she
was very cold and uncomfortable. And she did complain
that the handcuffs were too tight and she complained that
they were uncomfortable and could they be removed.
It's not a garage in -- in the way that the
vision of it, but also if you look at it, it's -- and the
-- the jury did look at it because it had a videotape of
this. You could see that the -- the occupants were made
to be in a very uncomfortable situation that was
unnecessary. And that -- that was clearly established law
in the Ninth Circuit certainly under Franklin that the
manner of a search that was unnecessarily prolonged or
painful or an unnecessary invasion of privacy was clearly
established law in the Ninth Circuit as of 1994.
I think in the Heitschmidt case, which is very
similar in a lot of ways to our case, that came out after
the search, but applied the same reasoning to a 1994
search. You had the same kind of handcuffing of a non-
suspect as to whom the -- the officers didn't have that --
that kind of -- of suspicion. And the Fifth Circuit found
that that was a violation and denied qualified immunity to
the officers.
So from our standpoint, on the issue of being
detained past the time, I think it's just a clear case. I
think the other side has conceded that if -- if there's
this evidence in the record, which there is, the judgment
has to be affirmed on that basis.
On -- on the handcuffing issue, we believe the
same principle has to apply because the facts have to be
viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, and
when you view those facts, I -- it -- it is -- no
reasonable officer would believe you could do those things
to Ms. Mena in these circumstances based on the law at the
time.
And I think that it would be -- what the -- what
the United States and -- and what petitioners' counsel is
asking for is really for a radical change of law
themselves. We're happy with Summers and Graham and the
way that applies, and the -- the jury instruction was
based on -- on Summers and Graham and on Franklin. The
language is taken directly from those cases.
And -- and the -- the jury in a case like this
-- qualified immunity obviously provides some protection
for -- for officers that when -- when a reasonable officer
wouldn't know these things. But jury verdicts also play a
crucial role in a civil rights case. In this case, a jury
of our community found that Iris Mena had been subjected
to an abuse of -- a specific abuse of authority in being
held beyond the time of -- of the search, even at a time
when the prime target was -- was free to go about his
business with a citation, and was held in these painful
handcuffs for a period of over 2 hours in circumstances
where, in the totality of the circumstances, she was
treated much more harshly than anything this Court, I
think, contemplated in the Summers case.
And I think that officers know how to --
officers know how to handle the Fourth Amendment issues
involved in this case. They don't need a special rule
because that rule would end up meaning that when you go in
and you don't find what you're afraid of, that everybody
is still going to be subjected to this kind of serious
intrusion on their individual liberty. And so we would
urge the Court not to go down this new path that the
United States and the petitioners are asking and to affirm
the judgment because it was based on clearly established
principles that this Court and other courts around the
country have -- have established.
Thank you very much.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.
Mr. Phillips, you have about 3 and a half
minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice Stevens.
I want to start with essentially the question
that Justices Breyer and Kennedy raised, which is what do
you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit is wrong, that
the questioning here violated the Fourth Amendment, and
what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit was
wrong in saying that the officers have an affirmative duty
in the middle of a Summers detention to make an assessment
on an individualized basis as to the risks posed by any
individual detainee. Those are rulings that I submit to
you are plainly erroneous and warrant reversal on that
basis alone.
At that stage, if the respondent wants to argue
to the Ninth Circuit that that 15 minutes is, in fact,
proved by the facts of this case, that's fine, but
understand, those issues were put to the Ninth Circuit,
and the Ninth Circuit did not affirm on the alternative
ground that there were 15 minutes here. The Ninth Circuit
expressly never -- or didn't expressly but never said one
word about a period of time after the search ended in this
particular case, and that's not an accident because there
is no testimony. The officer said he didn't remember and
when asked, well, would 10 to 15 minutes be consistent
with your memory, well, of course, it would. He didn't
remember anything. So there's nothing in that evidence,
and there's no way -- I have looked at that tape. I ask
you to look at that tape. I guarantee you there's no way
you can draw any inference as to at what point in this
process she was released vis-a-vis the end of this
particular -- this particular search being executed.
JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so do we have the tape
here?
MR. PHILLIPS: I assume you have the tape. It's
part of the record. It should be in the clerk's office.
If you don't have it, I'd be more than happy to send you a
copy.
The --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was no -- there was
no objection to that question going to the jury, was the
duration unreasonable.
MR. PHILLIPS: Of course not, Justice Ginsburg,
because the issue before the jury was whether or not the
-- we had an affirmative duty to make an evaluation in the
middle of the search as to whether or not she posed a -- a
threat. That was --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the jury --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- their theory of the case, and
that's what the Ninth Circuit said, is yes, we do have
that affirmative obligation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the jury answered the --
just the general question, was the duration unreasonable,
and the jury said yes.
MR. PHILLIPS: Not of the search. Of her
detention.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, of her detention. And that
was based on the jury's determination that we had detained
her beyond the period we had done the sweep.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the district court got
it right and the Ninth Circuit wrote a poor opinion, why
should we upset the judgment in the case? In other words,
if what we had here was a trial that was okay, a district
judge that behaved -- gave a proper charge, then the Ninth
Circuit writes an opinion that doesn't seem to deal with
what the district court and the jury decided.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- the court of
appeals' obligation here was to evaluate our argument that
we should -- we were entitled to judgment as a matter of
law. The court of appeals put forth what it regarded as
the most legitimate bases on which to affirm the judgment
in this case. The fact that neither of those withstand
serious scrutiny, Justice Ginsburg, seems to me to be a
basis for reversing the Ninth Circuit and allowing the
matter to go back at this point.
And -- and that is exactly what this Court does
in -- you know, said it will do in Ornelas, that it is a
de novo review. Punitive damages, exactly like a punitive
damages cases. Juries make punitive damages
determinations every day and every day courts of appeals
and trial judges review those damages awards de novo
because they -- because the question is not just what are
the historical facts -- that you give deference to the
jury on -- but on the fundamental question of what is the
rule of law that will govern the police officers in the
execution of search warrants in circumstances like this.
They need protection, Your Honor.
Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
