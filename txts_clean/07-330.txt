(10:10 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear
argument first today in Case 07-330, Greenlaw versus
United States.
Ms. Howe.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. HOWE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
For over 200 years, this Court has held,
without exception, that an appellate court may not
modify a judgment in a party's favor unless that party
has filed a notice of appeal. Such a rule, this Court
has explained, serves important interests in notice and
finality.
In 1984, Congress enacted the Sentencing
Reform Act against the backdrop of this well settled
rule. In 18 U.S.C. section 3742, Congress provided for
limited appellate review of sentencing errors. Nothing
in the text, structure, or history of section 3742
reflects any intent by Congress to deviate from the
inveterate and certain cross-appeal rule, nor is there
any reason why sentencing appeals should be treated any
differently from other appeals. Instead, section 3742
reflects traditional principles of appellate
jurisdiction. In --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this
question? I've been thinking about this case.
Supposing your client prevailed on appeal and they held
a resentencing.  Could the district judge have increased
the sentence?
MS. HOWE: No. It could not have because
the government --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The district judge could
not have increased it? If they sent it back for a new
sentencing, a fresh hearing on what the sentencing
should be, would the district judge have been foreclosed
from giving a higher sentence than he gave the first
time?
MS. HOWE: If -- he would have been
foreclosed, yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What's the authority for
that proposition?
MS. HOWE: Simply that the -- the district
--
JUSTICE STEVENS: Say, if it was a capital
case and he won on appeal, he could get the death
sentence the second time around, which is a little more
serious sentence.
Why couldn't he have gotten a higher
sentence.
MS. HOWE: This is a -- the case actually in
United States versus Harvey, which was a case out of the
Third Circuit, and, although the district court could
order the same sentence, it can't increase the sentence.
Yes. It would be circumventing the cross-appeal rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that based on any --
any precedent of this Court's?
MS. HOWE: No. It's based on the
cross-appeal rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So just on the
cross-appeal rule?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought
it would depend on what the mandate from the court of
appeals said. If the mandate said the sentence is
vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing, it
seems to me that leaves open the full range of
legitimate sentencing.
MS. HOWE: Certainly. I mean, our argument
would be that the -- you know, if the court of appeals
can't order the sentence increased, that on remand the
district court couldn't circumvent the cross-appeal rule
by increasing the sentence as well.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the court
of appeals -- if your argument is correct, the court of
appeals is limited solely by virtue of the failure to
file a notice of cross-appeal. That -- that's a
limitation that wouldn't apply in the district court.
MS. HOWE: No, that's certainly true, that
it would be circumventing the cross-appeal rule to allow
the district court to do something that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it would also, I take
it, be circumventing what could happen in the district
court. You have to move very -- seven days in the
district court for mathematical error, and that's it.
MS. HOWE: Yes, under this rule.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than for assistance
--
MS. HOWE: Yes, the district court has, I
believe, seven days to correct the sentence.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: This would not be a
mathematical error?
MS. HOWE: No. This would not be a
mathematical error, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I could have sworn that
I've seen more than one petition for certiorari in which
the claim is that the sentence was increased on remand
vindictively. I'm sure I've seen cert petitions like
that. And you're telling me that the assertion of
vindictiveness is unnecessary, and it just can't be
increased on remand?
But all you have is a court of appeals case
for that.
MS. HOWE: Yes, we --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Perhaps that's after a new
trial.
MS. HOWE: Perhaps.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What happens if it's --
what happens if the sentence is five years, reversed on
appeal, error in evidence, same -- same offense, same
indictment? Then you have to comply with the
vindictiveness rules before he can give a higher
sentence?
MS. HOWE: I think it might be different if
it were -- if there were a new trial on the same
indictment. But -- you know, going back to the
cross-appeal rule, I mean, the court of appeals could --
the district court could certainly impose the same
sentence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you think is the
rule if there's a new trial and the judge says, you
know, what about this, I heard the evidence again; I
think I'm going to increase the sentence?
MS. HOWE: Well, our argument would be that
the government had forfeited the right to make that
argument and that the district court would not be -- you
know, that would essentially be sua sponte ordering --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what's sua sponte --
MS. HOWE: You know, if the government had
--
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a resentence.
There's a new judgment, a new conviction. What happens
then?
MS. HOWE: New judgment and conviction -- it
-- the rule may be different. Unless double jeopardy
may apply as well.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Double jeopardy if it's a
new judge? Is that what you said?
MS. HOWE: I -- I'm not sure.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Who asked this question?
We're going to get a totally different case here.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's go back to where
you started, and that was with the statute, 37 -- what
is it? 42?
MS. HOWE: 42.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- (f). And the -- that
has two subparts, and the first part just says the court
of appeals can decide whether a sentence was imposed in
violation of law, period.
And (2) has two subparts that refer to the
party appealing. So why doesn't the first one cover
both sides when the second one is distinctly divided
into (a) and (b) parts?
MS. HOWE: Certainly, Justice Ginsburg. And
that -- this is reprinted on page 5a of the government's
brief. And the inference that I think,
Justice Ginsburg, you're drawing and that the amicus
would have you draw is that the fact that the subsection
(f)(2), which is on page 6a, subsection (f)(2)(A) and
(b) refer to whether the appeal has been filed; whereas,
subsection (f)(1) says not, which means that, in some
circumstances, the cross-appeal rule does not apply in
circumstances such as that.
But our interpretation, which we think is
the correct one, is that the only reason that subsection
(f)(1) does not refer to whether an appeal has been
filed is that subsection (f)(1) refers to the kind of
claims that both defendants and the government can
bring; whereas, subsection (f)(2) parallels
subsections(a)(3) and (b)(3), but (c), only the
defendant can appeal an upward departure; only the
government can appeal a downward departure.
And our interpretation, again, which we
think is the correct one, is that subsection (f)(1)
doesn't need to refer to whether an appeal has been
filed, because -- because both the defendant and the
government can bring those kinds of appeals.
And even if you don't agree with that
interpretation, I think it's worth noting that the
amicus -- that the amicus's construction is further
flawed for three reasons. And the first is that that
would cause subsection (f)(2) to operate illogically.
There's no reason why the -- for example, if you had a
case in which the defendant had appealed and the
government had not appealed, under this interpretation
the court of appeals could increase a sentence if it
found there had been a misapplication of the Guidelines
that would result in an increase in the defendant's
sentence; but the court of appeals would not be allowed
to increase the defendant's sentence if it found that
there was an unwarranted downward departure, because the
government had filed a notice of appeal. We don't think
-- that doesn't make any sense. We don't think there's
any reason why Congress would have intended for it to
operate this way.
The second reason is that this is a very
thin reed to rest this construction of the statute on,
given that Congress must have been aware of the
cross-appeal rule. There's no reason to think that it
would have departed from two centuries of appellate
practice in this way, based on this -- this very thin
reed, and in fact we know from the Organized Crime
Control Act of 1970 that Congress was aware of the
cross-appeal rule because in that case it expressly
carved out that exception --
JUSTICE BREYER: What happens if it's just
the converse case? The same thing, I take it.
MS. HOWE: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE BREYER: We have a government
appeal. The sentence was 10 years. The government
thinks it should be 20.
On appeal, the appellate court thinks the
government is wrong, and moreover, the appellate court
discovers an error: It should have been one year. And
you're saying, well, according to you, not only is the
court of appeals helpless, but the district court is
helpless. So this person is in jail for nine years
where he shouldn't have been. That's your position
here?
MS. HOWE: That's correct, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's a pretty tough
position. It -- it seems to me there could be errors --
and I guess if he's sentenced to death, it's the same.
I mean, the -- the -- it's a pretty tough position,
isn't it? That there is no authority in the courts of
appeals, or in the district court, or anywhere in the
system to create -- to correct a serious error where a
person could, in fact, be in prison for a long time
contrary to the law.
MS. HOWE: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: How is it supposed to work
in your system that we get those errors corrected?
MS. HOWE: I have three points,
Justice Breyer.
The first is that Congress must have been
aware of this scenario in particular because in the
Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, when the government
appeals, that -- in those provisions, that brought up
the defendant's sentence and his conviction for review.
And Congress decided, for whatever reason, not to
continue that -- that exception to the cross-appeal rule
when it enacted the Sentencing Reform Act.
The second point, Justice Breyer, is that
we're not aware that there's actually any body of case
law in which this happened. No one has pointed to any
cases in which this has actually happened. The --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I believe you say it has
decided not to make an exception to the cross-appeal
rule. Of course, the cross-appeal rule itself is not
statutory, is it?
MS. HOWE: The cross-appeal rule itself is
not statutory, but --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It's an arguable rule
among the courts of appeal as to whether there is such a
rule.
MS. HOWE: It is indeed, Justice Stevens,
but --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So it's not surprising
that Congress didn't make exception to a rule that isn't
that firmly established.
MS. HOWE: It is not surprising, but we know
from the Organized Crime Control Act that Congress
certainly was aware of the cross-appeal rule, because in
that case it did carve out a limited exception.
And my third point, Justice Breyer,
returning to your question, is that the defendant in
that case may well have an argument, may be able to seek
post-conviction relief under section 2255, as the
Government acknowledges in its brief.
So he may be able to go back to the district
court under section 2255 and obtain relief in that
manner.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was sort of an
important part of your case that the cross-appeal rule
was an established rule. You now knowledge that it's
not an established rule?
MS. HOWE: Well, we do believe it is
jurisdictional, Justice Scalia. In the Morley case,
which we think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not just jurisdictional but
well-established.
MS. HOWE: We believe it is both
well-established and jurisdictional. And we believe, in
particular, when you're talking about sentencing, even
if you don't agree with us that the cross-appeal rule
generally is jurisdiction, we believe that section 3742
is jurisdictional. Because it sets out in subsections A
and B, the kinds of errors that defendants and the
government can bring.
But we also believe that it ultimately
doesn't matter in this case, Justice Scalia, because
even if, as amicus concedes, it is merely a rule of
practice, it is a rule of practice that is not subject
to exception, and Mr. Greenlaw timely invoked it at his
earliest opportunity.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say it is a
well-established at least rule of practice.
MS. HOWE: Absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And what's to be said
against that? How many courts of appeals do not apply
that?
MS. HOWE: The Eighth Circuit in this case
certainly does not apply it. The Tenth Circuit --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they --
MS. HOWE: They acknowledge.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't apply it under
this statute. I am saying, apart from this statute,
what courts of appeals in other cases deny the existence
of a cross-appeal rule?
MS. HOWE: The District of Columbia Circuit
and the Ninth Circuit both regard it is a rule of
practice that may be subject to exceptions and
exceptional circumstances. But, even if it is a rule of
practice, Justice Scalia, we still prevail because
Mr. Greenlaw has timely invoked it at his earliest
opportunity and because in a sentencing context it is
not subject to any exception.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What difference does it
make? Now, you said this is a jurisdictional rule
because its no rule. What difference does it make if it
is labeled "jurisdictional," or if it is just regarded
as a tight procedural requirement?
MS. HOWE: It makes a difference,
Justice Ginsburg, in the sense that it cannot be waived
if it is jurisdictional. The Court can raise it at any
time. If it is a rule of practice, it is subject to
exception below. In this -- as in this case with this
rule, the Court has not found an exception in over 200
years. The -- in the sentencing context in particular,
it is not subject to exception.
And Mr. Greenlaw timely invoked it. If this
Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the
remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Howe.
Ms. Maynard.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Court of Appeals erred in increasing
Petitioner's sentence for two reasons:
First, it lacked jurisdiction to do so in
the absence of a notice of appeal by the Government
under 18 USC 3742(b).
Second, even assuming it did not strictly
lack jurisdiction, it nevertheless violated the
mandatory claim- processing rule that a judgment may not
be increased in favor of an appellee in the absence of a
timely --
JUSTICE ALITO: Now, if the cross-appeal
rule is jurisdictional, how do you account for the
sentencing-package cases? The court makes a mistake on
count 1, and the district court makes a mistake on count
1, the court of appeals vacates the entire sentence for
the development of a new sentencing package.
MS. MAYNARD: Those cases are not
inconsistent with the finding of jurisdictional, Justice
Alito, because in those cases the court of appeals has
granted the defendant's requested relief, and it has
vacated the judgment at the request of the defendant.
And then, once it goes back to the district
court, what the district court may lawfully do would
turn on the scope of the mandate, not on principles of
the cross-appeal rule.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But in this very case
could the court of appeals said: We will grant the
appellant a new sentencing hearing and send the case
back to the district for resentencing; and, by the way,
district judge, when you do the resentencing, take a
look at the section that imposes a mandatory minimum?
Could they have done that?
MS. MAYNARD: If the court of appeals had
found an error at the defendant's request, yes,
Justice Stevens, and remanded it, depending on the scope
of the mandate and under the scope of the mandate --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And you could have ended
up with precisely the same result that they ended up
with in this case.
MS. MAYNARD: But it would have been a key
difference in the sense that they would have found some
of the defendant's claims on appeal correct. Here the
court of appeals rejected all of the defendant's claims;
and, nevertheless, in the absence of a government
appeal, increased the Petitioner's sentence.
JUSTICE ALITO: So if the Court of Appeals
had said that the sentence that was imposed by the
district court was unreasonable by two months and
accepted the defendant's argument to that extent and
then remanded, on remand the district court could have
corrected the sentence on the gun counts.
MS. MAYNARD: It would have depended on how
the mandate was worded. But if they vacated the
sentence in its entirety and remanded it, the district
court could have imposed a lawful sentence at that time.
Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the
prosecution didn't ask for it? I thought that you were
relying on the division of authority between the
executive, the prosecutor, and the court. And that is
that a court reacts to the charges that the prosecutor
brings, and if the prosecutor isn't asking for a higher
sentence, the court has no authority to grant it.
MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. In the court
of appeals that is true. But I understood
Justice Alito's hypothetical to posit a situation where
at the defendant's request his sentence was vacated.
And then what the district court could do on remand
would depend on the scope of the mandate .
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? Why wouldn't
the prosecutor still have control and say: Judge, the
government is asking for ten years, no more?
MS. MAYNARD: Before the district court,
Justice Ginsburg, the government would be required to
press the law. And, as it did here, the law is that
under 924(c) this is a second, or subsequent, conviction
in count 10; and it is error. Petitioner should have
been sentenced to a second, or subsequent, sentence of
years on count 10.
So if it were back in the district court and
the district court were free under the scope of the
court of appeals mandate to impose sentence, then the
government would be obligated to argue the law before
the district court. What --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, usually the
mandate in these cases simply says, you know, the case
is remanded to the district court.
If that's all the mandate says, does that
authorize the district court to do the right thing under
the law?
MS. MAYNARD: The courts of appeals have
different rules, Your Honor, about whether or not a
general mandate of the type that you posit should be
assumed to open up all issues for sentencing or not.
And there's actually some disagreement in
the circuit on what one assumes from a general mandate.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, actually rule 35 was
changed because it used to be based on the mandate. But
now rule 35 says you can reopen within seven days after
the verdict or finding of guilty. So that would
indicate under the rules that the mandate is irrelevant.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, no, Your Honor. I think
rule 35 speaks to what the district can do within seven
days of renouncing the sentence. Once the sentence is
timely appealed, if the defendant were to prevail or if
the government were to prevail in a case in which the
government had actually appealed and it were to be
remanded, then the defendant --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Within the scope of the
appeal, which brings us right back to this case.
MS. MAYNARD: Within the scope of the
mandate.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't understand your
mandate rule as being consistent with your general
theory of the case. Because if the court of appeals
cannot order this kind of relief, how could it be that
the court of appeals' mandate would authorize the
relief?
It would seem to me that you've either got
to take the position that the mandate is, in effect, a
kind of neutral order. The district courts may or may
not have authority to do something after the mandate
comes down. But I don't see how you can take the
position that the mandate, itself, by the court of
appeals will, itself, determine what the district court
can do.
MS. MAYNARD: Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Because, in effect, I think
you are saying, by structuring the mandate in a certain
way, the court of appeals can open the door to something
that the court of appeals, itself, could not do. But by
structuring the mandate in a different way, the court of
appeals can cut off the possibility of district court
orders of a sort that the court of appeals couldn't do.
And that seems -- that is what seems to me inconsistent
with your theory of the limited court of appeals
jurisdiction.
MS. MAYNARD: I don't think it is anomalous,
Your Honor, in a case in which the court of appeals has
jurisdiction over a claim, grants the requested relief,
and vacates the sentence. For then, what the district
court can do can turn on the scope of the court of
appeals mandate.
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Now, let's
consider -- assuming that the mandate leaves open -- the
question open entirely for the district court.
You said ultimately what the district court
can do depends on the mandate. Can the court of appeals
also by mandate say: And by the way, district court,
because we couldn't increase the sentence here, you
can't do it either? Is that open to the court of
appeals?
MS. MAYNARD: I don't know there's any court
of appeals that has held that it could do that. It --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is the play in
the mandate that you are assuming when you say it
depends on the mandate? What the district court can do
would depend on the mandate.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, I'm not sure I
understand the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Where is the -- what option
does the court of appeals -- given the limits on what
the court of appeals itself can order, what are the
options that the court of appeals has in writing the
mandate that will determine what the district court can
do? What are you getting at.
MS. MAYNARD: I'm not sure that that's -- I
don't know the precise contours of that, Justice Souter,
but if the court of appeals grants the Petitioner's
request to vacate the sentence --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.
MS. MAYNARD: -- and then remands for
resentencing, in a general way, that could leave open to
the district court the ability to resentence.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MS. MAYNARD: But one --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Now you say that could
leave open -- if a mandate is general, that could leave
open. Can the mandate be specific in precluding?
MS. MAYNARD: Given the lack of an appeal
here.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.
MS. MAYNARD: By the government?
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.
MS. MAYNARD: I -- I suppose it -- it might
do that. I suppose it -- it might be able to do that.
Here --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know about your
initial premise. I -- I take it the policy here is that
the defendant who appeals ought to know what's at stake
in the appeal. He shouldn't be surprised.
MS. MAYNARD: That's right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If he cross-appeals, fine;
if he doesn't cross-appeal, he knows what the stakes
are.
MS. MAYNARD: That's right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But now you're saying that
if the sentence is -- is vacated, they can start all
over? That the district court can't start all over if
it's still in the district court. Why should the court
of appeals have any more authority than the district
court does?
MS. MAYNARD: Well, because it -- once
the court -- if the Petitioner -- I mean -- at any risk
in any appeal, and this is true in civil cases, too, you
know, if you seek a new trial on damages, for example,
in a civil case, because of instructional error, and you
go back, I think, you know, the jury who decides the
damages a second time isn't bound by the first jury's
decision. Any time --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- the
defendant who is appealing has to be very careful about
the relief he requests? He says I don't want the
sentence vacated; I want the sentence reduced to five
years instead of 10.
And nothing else? That's the only relief I
seek?
MS. MAYNARD: I think if the court of
appeals finds error in the sentence it vacates under the
-- the remedial provisions in 3742 for the -- for the
court -- for the district court to resentence the
Petitioner.
For example --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well -- if that's the case,
if the -- if the -- if it cannot be structured by the
request for relief as the Chief Justice is suggesting,
then on the Government's theory, in a case like this, if
the defendant wins on appeal, he is in serious trouble
when that case goes back to the district court; whereas
if he loses, he can't be any worse off than he is now.
That's a strange -- that's a strange rule.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, if the defendant wins in
the sentencing appeal, there -- there's always a chance
that on -- on remand, the -- the district court will
reconfigure the sentence.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But in effect that means
then -- and this -- I didn't understand this to be your
position -- but that means, in effect, that the
cross-appeal rule is essentially, as you're arguing for
it, a formality. It limits what the district court can
do, but it is not a rule that embodies the notion that
when a defendant appeals the defendant ought to know, in
effect, what he can gain and what he can lose; because
if, on your theory, if the defendant wins and there's a
mandate back to the district court, it is wide open.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think, you know, if
you look at cases -- recent -- I think post-Booker for
example --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I want to look at
them but I want to know what your position is first.
And I take it your position is that if the defendant
wins, and he cannot by his request for leave limit the
relief, as the Chief Justice suggested, then when the
case goes back to the district court, in effect, the
slate is totally blank and he's starting all over again
and he is subject to -- to whatever outer limits he
would have been subject to in the first instance.
MS. MAYNARD: Right. I was going to use the
Booker case as an example. Post-Booker, you know,
defendants have appeals, saying I was innocent, or
mandatory Guidelines regime, and I want to be sentenced
under the advisory Guidelines regime. And when those is
cans have gone back, this -- courts of appeals have --
most of the courts of appeals have held that the
district court is not bound by original sentence -- it's
not free from the mandatory Guidelines. It can consider
all the factors as instructed by the Court, and isn't
simply decrease the sentence. And I think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then the cross-appeals rule
is essentially a rule of appellate court procedure and
nothing more.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think in this
situation, actually -- it definitely is a rule of
appellate court procedure.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah. But --
MS. MAYNARD: And it's definitely a
mandatory --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But it doesn't go beyond
that?
MS. MAYNARD: I think that's correct. If
you succeed on your appeal you may end up in the
district court worse off than when you began. But the
issue before this Court is what can a court of appeals
do in the absence of a party pressing a claim before it.
And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In that context,
aren't -- aren't you concerned about enlisting the court
of appeals in doing something illegal? I mean, they
know that what they're authorizing, or imposing really,
as a sentence is illegal.
MS. MAYNARD: No. All they -- all they're
doing, Your Honor, as we requested, is rejecting the
Petitioner's claims on appeal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm reminded of what
we do in statutory cases. If one party says this is, it
should be read A, and the other party says it should be
read B, we've had cases where we say, well, they're both
wrong, and we're going to read the statute as C because
we the Court want to do the right thing.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, the Government is not
agreeing that there was -- with the Petitioner there was
no deal error. What the Government is saying -- the
question is -- so this is not a situation like you're
positing, where the parties are trying to agree to the
governing law. This is a question of which issues are
properly in the court of appeals to start with.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, in my
hypothetical they weren't agreeing. One side was saying
B, the other side was saying A.
MS. MAYNARD: Fair enough.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the right answer
was C.
MS. MAYNARD: Fair enough, but here it is,
there's no disagreement about what the merits of the
governing law is; the question is, is that question
properly before the court of appeals.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't the Government
cross-appeal in this case?
MS. MAYNARD: There's nothing in the record
to indicate why the government didn't cross-appeal,
Justice Ginsburg. But there are good reasons why the
government wouldn't cross-appeal in any given case.
There are 8,000 plus adverse decisions against the
government in 2007, and reasons why the government might
not cross-appeal or appeal in a given case include the
length of the sentence the person has already received,
whether there's a need for clarification of a particular
question of law, whether this is a recurring error --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there problem of
getting the Solicitor General's office to authorize the
appeal?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Maynard --
MS. MAYNARD: But the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me many of
these horribles really exist, however we decide this
case. I don't know that anybody says that if there is
not a firm rule requiring the -- a cross-appeal, I don't
know that anybody says that the court of appeals must
search the record and correct any errors below.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, the amicus is
arguing that's the meaning of 3742 --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The statute talks about the
general --
MS. MAYNARD: In general --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The general cross-appeal
rule --
MS. MAYNARD: But there --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It happens all the time,
that there's an error in the judgment which the court of
appeals does not -- does not reach because there's no
court -- no cross-appeal. It's totally unexceptionable.
MS. MAYNARD: Exactly, Your Honor. And that
-- the danger to parties, in particular to the
government in having courts reach out and arrogate to
themselves the decision -- thank you -- the decision to
appeal is -- is illustrated by this particular case. In
footnote 6 of the court of appeals opinion it recognizes
a second error that aggrieves the government, deciding
it was plain --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask this one
question? This problem has been around for a long, long
time; and sometimes cross-appeals -- courts of appeals
have corrected what they thought was plain error, and
without a cross-appeal there.
Has that generated a whole lot of problems
over the years? I mean there are isolated cases that
you've all been able to find searching 30 or 40 years of
jurisprudence, but I don't see any widespread problem
being generated by the courts of appeals who have
disagreed with your view.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, if I could make two
points. The court of appeals actually found two errors
that aggrieved the government here, Justice Stevens, and
ruled for us only on one. So in a case where we didn't
notice an appeal, on an issue we did not brief, the
court of appeals ruled against us.
And second, I'm aware of no case in this
Court where this Court has reached out to find plain
error on behalf of a nonpetitioning respondent or a
non-appealing appellate.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Ms. Maynard.
Mr. Jorgensen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY T. JORGENSEN,
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW
MR. JORGENSEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
There are three questions really in this
case, and the Court need not resolve all of them
depending upon how it resolves the others, but some of
them get lost sometimes, so I would like to state what
the three are.
The three are first, does section 3742
provide an answer? Is it an affirmative grant of power
to the court of appeals to the Eighth Circuit to give
the right answer when the Petitioner asked them is my
sentence imposed in violation of law? Or is it a limit
on the court's power telling them they cannot provide
him with relief? That's the first question.
If the Court concludes that it's neither --
if a Court a court concludes either that it is a grant
of jurisdiction, or rather a power -- or that it's not,
that it's an affirmative limit, then the -- if the Court
concludes that 3742 is more like 1291, just a general
appellate statute that does not give the answer here,
then the Court has to go on to decide is this case -- is
this rule, this cross-appeal rule, in the criminal
context not the civil context that is -- that is subject
of this 200 years of discussion, but in the criminal
context is it a jurisdictional limit on what the courts
can do or is it a rule of practice.
And then finally, if the Court concludes --
if the Court concludes it is a jurisdictional limit,
then that's the end. If the Court concludes that it is
a rule of practice, the final third question is:  Is it
a waivable rule of practice or is it a firm and
inflexible rule of practice? I think what often gets
assumed. But, of course, in Kontrick, in Bowles, the
Court addresses the issue in that case -- in those cases
and decides whether the rule of practice at issue in
that case --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jorgensen, suppose I
think there's a larger anterior question to all of this?
And that is what I suggested in the colloquy with
Ms. Howe, we have a system in which the prosecutor can
bring charges. The judge may think, my goodness,
looking at this set of facts, you could have charged
much more.
The judge can't do that, he can't tell the
prosecutor you have to charge "Y" in addition to "X".
The government chooses not to appeal. Now, what right
does the court say, I know you didn't appeal,
Government, but should have so we're going to take care
of it for you?
It seems to me that our system rests on a
principle of party presentation as many systems do not.
In many systems, the court does shape the controversy
and can intrude issues on its own. But in our
adversarial system, we rely on counsel to do that kind
of thing. So, my problem with your whole position,
without getting down to particular statutory provisions,
is what business does the court have to put an issue in
the case that counsel chose not to raise?
MR. JORGENSEN: The answer to that question,
Justice Ginsburg, is multi-part, and I'll try to move
through it quickly. This Court had said -- made the
very point that you made at the charging stage. That at
the charging stage the court -- the district court
cannot decide what a criminal will be charged with; but
that once the trial has proceeded to judgment, that
prosecutorial discretion is at an end. I wish I could
remember the name of the case, but Justice Scalia was
the author.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Me, too.
(Laughter.)
MR. JORGENSEN: The point being that once a
crime has been proven, the law kicks in, and the
defendant must be sentenced in accordance with lawful.
The same is true on appeal. I'm not advocating here
for, I think, what your question would assume, which
would be a roving court of jurisdiction -- a roving
court of appeals that could reach out and take
jurisdiction over a case that has not been brought to
it.
Under 3742 no one questions that the court
has jurisdiction over the case, over the very sentencing
issues because somebody has filed a notice of appeal and
brought it to the court. The only question is when the
defendant says to the court under 3742(a)(1) was my
sentence imposed and the statutory languages in
violation of law, can the Eighth Circuit provide the
right answer or is it powerless to provide the right
answer to only provide an answer that benefits him?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Could we discuss -- let's
leave aside for the moment what the background rule of
law is and discuss whether -- I guess it was your first
point -- whether this particular statute proscribes the
answer, and therefore, we don't have to go any further.
Why do you say it proscribes the answer?
MR. JORGENSEN: I believe that it does,
Justice, because everybody agrees that the Sentencing
Reform Act was a clean break with the past and imposed
an entirely new regime. So, the talk about the regime
of the past is somewhat beside the point.
So then you get down to the language itself
of section 3742. Under (a), it provides that a
defendant may ask the court of appeals was my sentence
imposed in violation of law; and under (b)(1), the
government can raised same appeal. Then under (d), the
parties certify to the court or bring to the court the
record that they think addresses the issue that either
side raised; and then in (e), the court -- (e) says the
court shall decide whether it was imposed in violation
of law; and then (f) (1) says if the court determines
that it was imposed in violation of law, it shall send
it back with instructions.
Now, the main answer to that is well,
(f)(1) -- you have to get all the way to (f)(1) before
you have got the answer. And that's unsurprising. I
don't think any member of the court would say that the
Eighth Circuit lacks the power, is barred from noticing
the 924(c) error here.
Certainly the Eighth Circuit could see it;
certainly the Eighth Circuit could say it. I see the
error here. The only question is, can it provide the
remedy? And that's what (f)(1) says.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why would -- why
would Congress want a different disposition for (f)(1)
than for (f)(2)? It's clear under (f)(2) if the
sentence is outside the applicable guidelines and the --
or if the departure is based on an impermissible factor
or is to an unreasonable degree or the sentence was
imposed for an offense for which there is no applicable
guideline and its plainly unreasonable, for that, it is
clear that if it hasn't been raised by one or the other
party, the court doesn't get into it.
Why would it want a different rule for those
two? In other words, I'm saying that far from
supporting your case, as your brief suggests, (f)(2) (a)
and (a) seems to me harms your case.
MR. JORGENSEN: If I can give a two-part
answer, Justice. First, the court is not in the
practice of overturning what the plain language says on
a sort of legislative history or surmising what Congress
may have been motivated by. But even if it were, there
is a clear answer.
(F)(1) subsumes (a)(1) and (a)(2) and (b)(1)
and (b)(2). And the questions under those statutes or
rather those provisions are legal questions. The kind
of questions was this sentence imposed under (a)(1),
(b)(1) in violation of law or (a)(2), (b)(2), was it an
incorrect application of Sentencing Guidelines?
If the court of appeals gets that wrong,
that's the kind of thing that's going to be imposed in
everybody else's case. Under (3) and (4) it's this
defendant's case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Wait, (2)(a) and (b) I
thought -- do I not have this right, (2)(a) and (b) say
the same thing as (1)? It says if the sentence is too
high says the defendant's appeal, then what you do is
you vacate it and send it back with such instructions as
the court considers appropriate.
MR. JORGENSEN: Indeed.
JUSTICE BREYER: Subject to (g), which has
to do with the district court.
Then the other part says if it is too low
and it was the government that appealed, the court shall
set it aside and send it back with such instructions as
it considers appropriate, again subject to (g).
So all three say the same thing.
JUSTICE SCALIA:
the defendant has appealed.
JUSTICE BREYER:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
the government has appealed.
JUSTICE BREYER:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
Not if it's too high and
That's what --
Not if it's too high and
That's right.
If it's too high and the
government has appealed, you don't get any relief
under -- under --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, do you. If it's too
high -- wait. Wait. If it is too -- ah.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: I see.
MR. JORGENSEN: You're exactly right,
Justice Scalia. So the question is, why would Congress
say what is plainly said, which is under (f)(1)
violations of law and incorrect applications of the
Sentencing Guidelines, the court gives the right answer
no matter who appeals. But under (f)(2) Congress
specifies it matters under this who appeals. And the
reason is, in those instances, it is too high in this
defendant's case, and this defendant can be entrusted to
forward his own cause; but under (a)(1) and (a)(2), then
you get a court of appeals precedent that gives the
wrong answer, if a question of law or the application of
the Sentencing Guidelines.
So there is a difference between (a)(1),
(a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(2) as --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, that difference
disappears if you say that, in fact, the whole thing
assumes that the factor complained of has been brought
to the court's attention by the proper person. So that
(f)(1) assumes that if it's the government appealing in
violation of law because the defendant was given too
little, or if it's the defendant appealing because in
violation of law that he was given too much, it makes
much more sense that way, it seems to me.
MR. JORGENSEN: That -- that -- if the Court
were to go there, Justice, I believe that goes back to
you previous question of: Should we assume or should
the Court believe that Congress was aware of its
history --
JUSTICE BREYER: The way to do this then is
-- is -- I see -- this section foresees basically what
the other side is saying. It foresees it, because it's
a very unusual case what happened here.
MR. JORGENSEN: It is a very --
JUSTICE BREYER: So the way you should
handle it, given this section, is the court of appeals
would send -- I'm trying this on -- the court of appeals
says, well, it's the defendant that appealed, who
appealed. He says the sentence is too high. Given what
we have in front us in the issues, he's right; now we've
noticed that there's is other problems here. So what we
do is send it back for resentencing. And, Judge, when
you resentence, look at it. And see if maybe we're
right. That would be a perfectly fair way to handle it,
and a normal way to handle it. Is that right?
MR. JORGENSEN: Well, importantly, Justice,
one, two, three, and four, one being: Is it posed in
violation of law? Two: Is it incorrection application
of Sentencing Guideline (c)(3)? Or is it too high?
There's a body of case law as to what kind of a field --
fields fit within what category. And the parties and
the courts of appeals are united in believing that the
Petitioner's question in this case fits within (a)(1):
Was his sentence imposed in vital of law.
But, as you know, the Court created the
reasonableness question in Booker, and then the courts
of appeals have agreed that that fits in within(a)(1).
JUSTICE BREYER: But you don't have --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not enough to say,
well, we've noticed by the way we're -- you know, in
looking at the proper appeal by the proper -- my
goodness, look what we've noticed.
It's not that. You're saying the court of
appeals has to search the record. It has to make sure
that there were no errors in favor -- or harming the
other party who has not cross-appealed.
And that's a considerable burden, as Judge
Boudin's opinion on the court of appeals makes clear.
MR. JORGENSEN: Indeed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's extraordinary.
MR. JORGENSEN: Indeed, although it is what
3742 says, and I believe it's actually not that
different than what happens with jurisdictional issues.
The court must resolve those that are brought to it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Precisely so.
MR. JORGENSEN: And then the court notices
the ones that are obvious, has a duty to look for them
because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is why we have tried
to pare down what is jurisdictional.
MR. JORGENSEN: And on that question, I --
before the time runs out, I want to, Justice Scalia,
follow up on your question, which is: What if the Court
assumes that 3742 does not provide the answer? Which is
I believe where you're going.
Then the Court confronts the question of, is
the cross-appeal rule jurisdictional or a rule of
practice? Now, the Court has provided the answer to
that once in, I believe it said, Langnes, and said that
it is a rule of practice. And then since, there's been
obviously a long period of time. And then the Court has
had its series of cases contra Bowles, Arbaugh. And
under those cases, there is no good argument that it's
jurisdictional. The teachings of those cases is that
the Court has used the phrases "power" and
"jurisdiction" too broadly, too loosely, and is now, as
you say, trying to cut back on those jurisdictional
limits. And a rule like this can only be jurisdictional
if it's based on a statute, and I believe all the
parties agree this rule is not based on a statute.
So then that gets us finally to the question
of, if 3742 does not provide the answer and it is a rule
of practice, is it a mandatory rule of practice, an
inflexible rule of practice? Or one where the Court can
use discretion as to whether or not to apply it when
it's invoked?
And the -- there can be no question that
there are discretionary rules of practice. Indeed, in
Bowles, the one issue on which all nine Justices agreed
is just that: Justice Souter, writing for the dissent,
would have found that that rule or practice was
discretionary. Justice Thomas, writing for --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it's
discretionary, how would you -- I assume it's reviewable
for abuse of discretion.
MR. JORGENSEN: Indeed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How would you know
whether it's an abuse of discretion or not? I mean, the
issue is going to be the same in every case. There was
no cross-appeal. If there had been, we would have
increased the sentence, and one court of appeals says,
well, we're not going to do it; and the other court of
appeals says, yes, we're going to do it.
Which one is reversed for abuse of
discretion?
MR. JORGENSEN: I believe the one that
refused to correct such a plain error, obviously.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you might
say that. But I mean --
(Laughter.)
MR. JORGENSEN: But your question was, what
is the standard? If I may, I believe that's the
question. And the Court has, I think, provided the --
several formulations of what the standard is. In
Langnes, the Court said good cause was the standard. In
Reynolds, which contrary to what Petitioner said was a
case where this Court afforded relief on a sentence to a
criminal Petitioner who had not brought that issue to
this --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, could do you this?
Because this is quite helpful to me. Reading, I started
out where Justice Scalia was at the beginning of this
argument. I thought the district court normally has it
open, to the judge, to resentence. Resentence is
resentence. You can't be vindictive, but that's the
limit. That's how it works normally, I thought.
And given -- if that's so, then you look at
the three sections we just saw, try to read them
together, and say they certainly are written with the
notion that the noticing of a plain error on the other
side is going to be few and far between if ever.
So the normal way to handle it is just what
we said: The judge decides on the record and the appeal
-- I decide this for the defendant here. But I've
noticed something, says the writing judge. And of
course it's open on resentencing to go into that.
MR. JORGENSEN: I --
JUSTICE BREYER: So if you were going to do
something other than that, in the court of appeals,
you'd have to have a reason, and it would have to be a
fairly good reason. So you don't close off the escape
hatch because we can't all foresee the future perfectly,
but you say it's going to be few and far between.
Now does that work?
MR. JORGENSEN: I believe it does work,
Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right.
MR. JORGENSEN: And I believe it --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This argument is not an
argument under the statute? This is an argument giving
your interpretation of what the background rule is?
MR. JORGENSEN: I believe that's right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you would limit the
background rule to plain error?
MR. JORGENSEN: Yes -- yes, Your Honor, I
would. And that does not really contradict what the
Eighth Circuit did here. Rule 52(b) is really another
formulation of the very same thing that the court said
in Langnes; that's good cause. In Neztsosie, it -- the
Court phrased it "countervailing considerations" which
outweigh the institutional interests in fair notice and
repose. And, of course, rule 52(b) talks about
"fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial
proceedings." They're all different formulations of the
same --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if it's such a
--
MR. JORGENSEN: -- of the same --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's such a plain
error, it's fair to to ask why the Government didn't
cross-appeal. If you --
MR. JORGENSEN: There is nothing in the
record here, Justice, on that. The Government has been
very careful not to say or urge you on reply -- to ask.
I believe it was a blunder, and so to adopt --
JUSTICE SOUTER: A blunder?
MR. JORGENSEN: A blunder. So, to adopt the
Government's rule is to adopt a new -- a new
exclusionary rule that the defendant goes free when the
constable blunders.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if this were to be a
more frequent occurrence, i.e., plain errors, then we
were to rule for you and court of appeals generally
would do this, then a defendant might think twice
about appealing in a complex case.
MR. JORGENSEN: That's true, Justice.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because there's nothing
that could happen -- once the district court rules and
the seven days for error goes by, there's nothing that
anybody can do to raise it.
MR. JORGENSEN: Well, the first part of your
question was true, Justice Kennedy, but respectfully the
second part was not.
In the -- the way it currently works, under
the rules, a defendant must file his notice of appeal
before the Government files it. And so, as it currently
stands, he makes his choice before he ever knows. There
is no extra burden that would be placed on him.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, he doesn't have to
pursue it if the Government appeals.
MR. JORGENSEN: That's exactly right. And
the Government makes that point that at some point, if
the Government raises its appeal, he could strike a deal
with them. Now, it's not correct to assume that he
could then unilaterally walk away because there is a
notice of appeal, the Government's notice of appeal. So
he has to strike a deal with the Government at that
point. That's no different than in this case. At oral
argument, the Eighth Circuit asked both parties about
this error. He could have struck a deal then.
If this case turns on notice, there isn't a
notice problem here. It's all over the record. It's
raised at sentencing. It's raised on appeal. It's
discussed in the briefs. It's discussed at oral
argument. This error was known to all.
Now --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't understand that
a party couldn't voluntarily withdraw a notice of
appeal.
I mean, suppose the only way that the court
of appeals can get into this is because the defendant
has pursued an appeal.
Suppose this comes up and the defendant
says, oh, my goodness, I stand to get 15 more years in
prison; I'm withdrawing my notice of appeal. There's
nothing before the court of appeals then. Nothing.
MR. JORGENSEN: That's a critical
difference, Justice Ginsburg. You're exactly right that
the court of appeals must have, under 3742, a notice of
appeal, or it has no jurisdiction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. JORGENSEN: But under the hypothetical
we were discussing, I perhaps assumed incorrectly. I
thought we were talking about the defendant files his
notice of appeal before the Government ever files; then
subsequently the Government files as well. Now, if the
defendant withdraws, there's still a notice of appeal
before the court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.
MR. JORGENSEN: But if the government had
never filed, you're exactly right that the defendant
could take his back. But the problem is it doesn't
answer Justice Kennedy's question. His question was:
Isn't a defendant entitled to know that he's -- that the
Government might appeal, that he might be at risk, that
there might be a problem here? And my point is he
doesn't know under the current system anyway. He has to
make his choice before the Government ever makes its
choice. Now --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Jorgensen, may I take
you back to something you mentioned earlier in the
argument? And I thought I followed it at the time, and
I may not have understood you.
As I recall, you were explaining the
difference between (f)(1) and (f)(2)(A) and (B) by
saying that in (f)(1), which was -- which does not
embody any condition on who has appealed --
MR. JORGENSEN: Right.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the concern is that, if
there is an error, it's an error which will in effect
infect all cases. It's a circuit error, and it's
potentially there for any case that comes along for
sentencing; whereas, in (f)(2), if there's an error, the
limited damage is simply to the case itself, to the
particular defendant.
Where I don't follow that reasoning is in
the fact that F 1 refers not only to an incorrect -- to
a violation of law, but incorrect application of
sentencing guidelines, which would seem to include a --
the particulars of a given case. So am I either
misunderstanding your argument or maybe misunderstanding
subsection 1.
MR. JORGENSEN: Well, Justice Souter, the
lines between A 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not as bright as they
might be. But when Congress enacted it, in response to
Justice Scalia's question of why might Congress have
done this when it wrote it, which was before Booker,
which introduced some additional theory as to which of
those four does an appeal fit within, one was: Is it
imposed in violation of law?
And, using that clear language, you can
imagine the Congress would be concerned that violations
of law not go unremedied.
JUSTICE SOUTER: If that's all it said, I
would certainly understand your distinction.
MR. JORGENSEN: And then 2 is an incorrect
application of the sentencing guidelines, which, again,
at the time of the Sentencing Reform Act were intended
to be, I believe, mandatory.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So that it was a violation
of law?
MR. JORGENSEN: Indeed. There isn't that
much of a difference between 1 and 2. But then when you
get to 3 and 4, then you get into the language that
addresses the particulars of this case: Was this
defendant's -- was the application to this defendant too
high based on an unreasonable fact or to an unreasonable
degree, I believe is the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I guess the problem I still
have is some incorrect applications of the sentencing
guidelines pre-Booker were, in fact, violations of law.
But not all of them were, any more than all of them are
now. But forget the situation now. Not all of them
were.
And I don't see how you can draw the sort of
nonporous distinction that you are drawing. I mean it
is a good try; but even pre-Booker there are some
incorrect applications that could have been corrected on
an abuse standard that were not properly described as
violations of law per se.
MR. JORGENSEN: I think that's right,
Justice Souter. And I could only say that what we're
doing here is we are hypothesizing why would Congress
have said what they said; and it is a dangerous game to
play. But that is my best hypothesis. But it does say
what it says.
Now, if I can return -- and I hope this is
helpful -- to the questions that began the entire
argument, which is the sentencing -- the sentence
packaging rule or the sentencing package rule which
Justice Breyer addressed, I believe the right answer to
your question, Justice Stevens, is that under the way
the sentencing package rule works, which is applied, I
believe, by all circuits, is that if any part of a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What do we mean by the
"sentencing packaging rule"?
MR. JORGENSEN: That's a very good question,
Justice Scalia. Under section 3553(a) after the
Sentencing Reform Act was imposed, judges were --
district judges were empowered and given the obligation
to build a sentence that took into consideration a
number of competeding factors such that you might, if
you were a judge, a district judge, reduce a sentence
under one count of an indictment if you were going to
give more under another; and you put together a
sentencing package; and then that's the sentence that
the defendant receives.
And then when that goes up on appeal, if any
part of that package is undone, the whole package is
undone. This is the rule that the circuits follow.
To your question, Justice Ginsburg, I don't
believe they have a precedent of this Court to fall --
to base that on. But it is the rule that is nearly
uniformly followed. So then when the case goes back to
the district court, the district court is free to
construct a new sentence.
So, as here, if the defendant had prevailed
in any way, then back on remand the district judge could
have imposed the same sentence.
Now, a limit on that, Justice Scalia, is the
vindictiveness cases. That if there is any evidence
that the increased sentence, making the sentence the
same or more is as a -- you know, it's a pay back --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Getting what he deserves,
right?
MR. JORGENSEN: Exactly. And that can't be
done. But, otherwise, with that narrow exception, the
sentence can be exactly the same, even though the
defendant prevailed on appeal.
Now, that played out exactly in this case.
In this case, when it went back to the district court,
the defendant said to the district court: Don't give me
more. You can fit the new fifteen years within what I
already have. Give me what I already have.
And the District Judge said: No. I'm going
to give you more.
Now, the answer clearly, I think, cannot
turn on the fact that the Seventh -- excuse me -- the
Eighth Circuit knew the answer. We had some questions
about what if the Eighth Circuit said: Well, I see an
error here, but I don't know how it affects your
sentence, so I am sending you back. Would that be okay?
But it can't turn on the -- that the Seventh
Circuit knew in this instance that he would get an
increased sentence as versus it would be okay to send it
back without saying what the effect would be for the
district judge to impose.
And, Justice Kennedy, your question was:
What happens if there's a new trial? As my children
would say, it is a complete do-over. When the trial
starts all over again, new facts are found or not found,
and the sentence is completely constructed all over
again based on the facts as found by the jury in the
second trial.
If I can end, Justices, I would end by
saying that I believe section 3742 does provide the
answer here. Congress provided a clean break with the
past. The idea that Congress was aware of a clear rule
that they would have followed, I think, is contradicted
by Reynolds, where this Court did the opposite; Langnes,
where this Court said that the cross-appeal rule was a
rule of practice, not a jurisdictional limit; and the
confusion in the courts of appeals.
I believe the answer to your question,
justice Scalia, on whether it is well-established is
that in the civil context I believe the D.C. Third,
Fourth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits say that this is a
rule of practice while the Senate has debated it back
and forth.
And in Neztsosie the Court noted this
confusion and noted, indeed, that some of the circuits
are internally inconsistent as to what the rule is.
It is slightly different in the criminal
context. I believe the Eighth and the Tenth Circuits
have not followed -- have not followed the rule, while
the Second, Third, Fourth and Seventh have; and the
Fifth is internally inconsistent. I may -- I may have
some error, honestly, in that recitation. I did it from
memory when you asked.
But my point, I think, comes through no
matter what, which is: How could Congress have assumed
this is a clear rule and, when we write these words, the
courts will know that's what we mean, when there's all
this confusion amongst the courts?
Thank you, Your Honors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Howe, you have two minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. HOWE: Mr. Chief Justice, I have two
points. The first is that the amicus argues that
subsection (e) of section 3742 provides the answer in
this case: That upon a review of the record the Court
of Appeals shall determine. And so his argument is that
this authorizes and, in fact, requires the court of
appeals to determine whether any of the errors that are
outlined in subsection (e) have occurred. But (e) can't
possibly be this sort empowering, roving, free-standing
authority that the amicus believes it is.
Because if you look at the language of
subsection (e), all it provides -- and this Court has
recognized that it merely provides the scope of review
-- that, upon review of the record, the court of appeals
shall determine. It doesn't say anything about whether
a notice of appeal has been filed, how the record got
there. And to figure out those things you have to look
at the structure of the statute.
And when you look at the structure of the
statute, it is clear that subsections (a) and (b) are
the provisions that provide for appellate jurisdiction
in sentencing cases.
Amicus also tries to argue that, you know --
JUSTICE SCALIA: (E) also contradicts (f) --
MR. HOWE: (F)(2)and then --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- (2)(A) and (B) because
in some of those cases it doesn't determine that if the
appeal has been brought by the wrong party.
MS. HOWE: That's absolutely right. That
merely provides the remedy, Justice Scalia.
And the amicus tries also to argue that this
is not some sort of free-standing, roving appellate
authority. That, you know, for example, if the case is
brought under (A)(1), a violation of law, the court of
appeals only needs to determine whether it is a
violation of law. But he also argued that the court of
appeals is not obligated to scour the record for errors.
It is only to notice plain error.
But if one should start placing these
limits, these limits come from subsections (a) and (b)
and the background of traditional appellate practice.
And once you start placing these limits which do not
appear in the text on subsection (e), the entire
construction falls apart.
The second point I would make is that the
amicus argues that, somehow, section 3742 represents as
a break from the past; that Congress did not have in
mind the background of this well- established appellate
procedure. But in section 3742 Congress made clear --
may I finish -- it was only providing for limited
appellate review.
And if you are going to treat sentencing
cases differently in light of this court's historic
practice of construing the availability of government
appeals narrow rate, you need to treat -- you need to be
even more reluctant to deviate --

Howe.
