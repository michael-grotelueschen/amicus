CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
now in American Trucking Associations v. Michigan Public
Service Commission and a companion case.
Mr. Digges.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT DIGGES, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1230
MR. DIGGES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This case is a challenge to Michigan's $100 per
truck flat annual fee that is imposed on all trucks that
are registered to do point-to-point operations in the
State of Michigan. We submit that this fee, this flat per
truck fee, has the same impermissible effects on
interstate commerce as the two flat truck fees that were
struck down by this Court in American Trucking
Associations v. Scheiner.
In the American Trucking Associations v.
Scheiner case, this Court looked at the practical effect
of these fees and found that because of their
unapportioned structure, that the fees had four
interrelated types of impermissible effects on interstate
commerce.
First, the Court found that these kinds of flat
fees were a financial barrier against out-of-state motor
carriers even coming into the State that imposed the --
the fee. There's no question in this case that the
Michigan flat fee has the same kind of protectionist
quality.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- it does for trucks
that want to deliver things within the State of Michigan.
It doesn't for anybody else.
MR. DIGGES: Yes, it -- it discriminates and it
-- it has an exclusory effect on trucks -- out-of-state
carriers that want to compete in the -- and bring their
trucks across the -- the border of Michigan and compete
against local carriers for intrastate hauls.
JUSTICE SOUTER: It would have that -- it
certainly has that tendency. Do we have -- do we know in
fact what the effect is? Is it deterring anybody? How
many trucks does it affect?
MR. DIGGES: There was not a trial below. So we
don't have that fact.
We believe that as in the Scheiner case, these
-- these tendencies are inherent there. Because of the
structure of the fee, it not only has this effect, it has
what this Court called a hydraulic pressure effect, and
that is to -- for carriers, once they have paid this fee
as an entrance fee, to pull their trucks out of interstate
commerce and to concentrate them into -- in the State of
Michigan in the local activities. And that -- in fact,
the State acknowledges that. Below, the State said that
motor carriers should allocate or dedicate their trucks to
the State of Michigan in order to avoid these
consequences. And even the Michigan Court of Appeals
recognized that, saying a local carrier would be
discouraged from operating in interstate commerce.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, it also -- I mean,
you say it -- it favors the in-state -- intrastate carrier
because if you're doing nothing but intrastate carriage,
you -- you amortize the $100 over many more miles, whereas
the interstate carrier, much of whose business is out-of-
state, doesn't do that.
On the other hand, you can certainly argue that
-- that this tax discriminates against intrastate carriers
in -- in another respect, that is to say, interstate
carriers who -- who do nothing within the State do not pay
it, whereas the -- the Michigan carrier that does a lot of
interstate business but if he does one piece of intrastate
business -- interstate business, he still pays it. Isn't
that right?
MR. DIGGES: Well, Your Honor, I think what --
what that's saying -- and I know that was the argument
made in the Solicitor General's brief -- is that you can
discriminate against one component of interstate commerce,
those carriers that want to actually compete and do
intrastate business in the State, as long as you give a
benefit to another component of interstate commerce, those
who just wish to operate in the -- in the State of
Michigan in interstate commerce.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's not so much that you
necessarily can do it, but it -- it sort of interrupts the
-- the kind of the a priori reasoning and you're thrown
back on a -- on -- on a practical effects analysis under
Pike.
MR. DIGGES: No, Your Honor. I think what
happens is that -- that there are the segment of carriers
that would like to compete against intrastate carriers.
The fact that other carriers may be getting a break in
terms of regulatory fees -- and we don't know that to be
the truth, getting the other interstate carriers. It's
the Boston Stock Exchange, and I think it was said again
in the Scheiner case that -- that you can't discriminate
among interstate carriers.
And as we pointed out in our brief, you could
set up a situation in which a -- a State discriminated in
favor of interstate carriers in situations or industries
where their locals had no interest in competing, but where
their -- their locals were interested in competing, they
could set up a discriminatory system. So you can protect
timber industry in -- in Oregon and --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But may I ask this question?
Suppose you have an interstate carrier that does 100,000
miles of business in Michigan and you have an intrastate
carrier that does a 100,000 miles of business in Michigan.
They both say the -- pay the same tax, don't they?
MR. DIGGES: If they each do 100,000 miles of
intrastate business in Michigan --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. DIGGES: -- they would pay the same flat
fee.
JUSTICE STEVENS: They would both pay the same
tax, both the intra and the interstate. Now, that doesn't
sound to me like discrimination against either one.
MR. DIGGES: If -- if this -- if this tax was
apportioned based on mileage, it would not be
discrimination, but unfortunately, it is not and --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm just saying if the
intrastate and interstate carriers both have the same
intrastate mileage, they both pay the same tax.
MR. DIGGES: And we -- we would -- and again, if
this was a mileage-apportioned fee, it would be -- it
would be fine. But the fact is as in Scheiner, the out-
of-state carriers, because the interstate carrier is -- is
operating --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you might have an
intrastate carrier that does a smaller amount of mileage,
only 50,000 miles, and an interstate carrier that pays --
does 100,000 miles. They both pay the same tax too. And
everybody is treated alike on their intrastate business.
MR. DIGGES: That would be true but that --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And the tax only operates on
intrastate business.
MR. DIGGES: The factual situation is going to
be that the interstate carrier is just not going to have
the opportunity to do as much business in Michigan as the
intrastate carrier.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me you should
have introduced some evidence on that point. I mean, it
-- it really is an assumption of your unfairness argument
that purely intrastate carriers do significantly more
intrastate business than interstate carriers who choose to
do some interstate business. Now, does that strike you as
self-evident? It does not need any --
MR. DIGGES: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- demonstration?
MR. DIGGES: It does strike me as self-evident.
In fact, to courts below -- we have -- we've made this
argument. We've seen this argument now. The cases have
called it intuitively obvious. And from the discussion of
-- in the Scheiner case and from the discussion in the
Nippert case, the very difference between interstate and
intrastate commerce means that on average the interstate
carrier is just not going to use the State's facilities as
much as the in-state carrier.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Wouldn't we be better
able to decide this question after a trial rather than
speculation on both sides?
MR. DIGGES: I don't think a trial is necessary
because, as I say, this -- this Court quoted Justice
Frankfurter clearly, and I think the Solicitor General in
his brief says that on average the out-of-state carrier is
not going to get as much benefit from this fee. This is a
variable cost fee. In effect, the out-of-state carrier is
having to pay more than its fair share of the cost of the
-- of the State's regulatory system. And again, that's
something that was accepted in the Scheiner case, accepted
in -- in the Nippert case. And the intrastate carrier --
every time that it operates in the State, it is using that
privilege.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, Nippert was over
0 years ago, wasn't it?
MR. DIGGES: I think the Nippert case was from
the 1940's I believe. In any event, as we've been
discussing --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: It seems like 100
years ago.
(Laughter.)
MR. DIGGES: It's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Digges, this -- the --
the -- there was a question about the ramifications of the
position that you're presenting. That is, there are many
situations in which there is some kind of licensing fee
that is imposed on everyone, the same dollar amount,
although some people who are licensed will be doing
business in other States and have to get licenses there as
well. The example that was featured in the -- in the
briefs on the other side of the lawyer who is licensed,
say, in Massachusetts and also in D.C. does not get any
break on his D.C. Bar admission because he is also
admitted in Massachusetts, and in fact, does most of his
practice out-of-state, out of the District.
MR. DIGGES: Yes, Your Honor. I know that --
that example was given. I think there are a variety of
flat fees that would be unaffected by this. There are
fees that would be administrative charges and -- and if
all the State is doing is charging, for example, the cost
of a background investigation or the cost of a truck
inspection, a fixed cost, then it's fair to ask the
carrier to pay a fixed fee or to ask the taxpayer to pay a
fixed fee.
With respect to the bar fees, they are obviously
different than the trucking industry and -- and the
taxation of an instrumentality in interstate commerce.
But we think that there may be impracticalities in
apportioning a bar fee. You could have an attorney in his
office in Virginia that is working for a California
customer or California client that is being -- for a case
that is being tried in the court system of Oregon, and
then for transaction work, he could be working for a
customer or a client in -- in Missouri for -- a multi-
state. So it may be difficult to apportion fees. We
haven't really examined that.
But we know from this Court's decisions that --
that is easy and can be apportioned for truck fees, and
truck fees -- this Court said in Scheiner that the
technology is now available to look at the extent of the
activity and the taxpayer in -- in -- of the truck in the
State, and later on in a subsequent decision said that you
can easily track large physical objects over States. So
you can apportion these fees on trucks to their mileage in
the State, to their loads, to the gross revenue associated
with the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Scheiner case didn't
make a distinction based on in-state activity. I thought
that that -- that flat fee was applicable to every motor
carrier that went on the roads in Pennsylvania.
MR. DIGGES: That is accurate, Your Honor, but
-- but nominally Scheiner -- for instance, the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the Scheiner case did say
that -- did uphold the fee because they said only
Pennsylvania could charge for the privilege of using
Pennsylvania's highways. So like a lot of -- like all
interstate commerce, you can always -- as -- as the Court
said in Nippert, you can always find -- carve out a local
activity to say that this is going to be the focus of the
tax.
I think a problem here is with the -- the
approach taken by the State and the Solicitor General is
they suggest that you go back to the days in which you're
trying to draw a line between interstate and intrastate
activity, this time not because the intrastate activity is
going to be immune from the tax, but this time because
you're going to have some separate, different kind of test
applicable to something that clearly is subject to
Commerce Clause protections, but is -- is, in their view,
subject to a more lenient Commerce Clause protection. And
I don't think this Court wants to retreat back to the days
of having to draw a line between interstate and intrastate
commerce and -- and then having separate tests.
If there are no more questions, I'd like to
reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal. Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Digges.
Mr. Hanson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. HANSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1234
MR. HANSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In contrast to the ATA case, the question before
the Court today in the Mid-Con case is whether the fee on
vehicles operating solely in interstate commerce is
preempted by 49 U.S.C., section 14504.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It's the same fee we're
talking about.
MR. HANSON: It is --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But a different theory of
invalidity.
MR. HANSON: It is not the same fee. The -- the
fee under subsection (1) that ATA is arguing about is an
intrastate fee charged only to --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Intrastate.
MR. HANSON: -- carriers that engage in
intrastate activities.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, and yours is the
interstate fee.
MR. HANSON: The subsection (2) fee under
8.1 --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And your fee applies to all
Michigan-plated vehicles. Am I correct about that?
MR. HANSON: That are operating solely in
interstate commerce.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do -- do I understand that the
two distinctions in what is done with the -- or the way
the fee is collected and what's done with it is that the
-- the fee is charged against the -- is it the operator as
opposed to the owner, if there is a distinction? Is -- is
that correct?
MR. HANSON: All of the fees under subsections
(1) and (2) are charged against the motor carrier --
JUSTICE SOUTER: The carrier.
MR. HANSON: -- or --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's the term I should use.
MR. HANSON: -- motor carrier, not to the owner.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Which may not be the owner.
And number two, as I understand it, as distinct
from the registration fee, this fee goes to a different
State department. Is that right?
MR. HANSON: That's correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, let -- that's -- that's a
premise for a question I want to ask you, and the question
is in economic effect, is there any difference really
between charging this $100 fee with those differences from
the registration fee and simply jacking up the
registration fee by $100? Would there -- would there be
any economic difference to the -- to the public or -- or
indeed even to the carriers if they simply jacked up the
-- the registration fee by $100? Because the -- the
registration fee is passed on to the carrier, if it's not
the owner, and the carrier -- it doesn't make any
difference to the carrier whether the -- whether the State
diverts the $100 up front or -- or divides the -- the
registration fee after it's paid. So is there any
economic difference?
MR. HANSON: Yes, there is and the reason why
there is a difference is that the -- the fees that are
paid for plating are under the -- under the International
Reciprocity Plan, the registration plan, the IRP. And
that is an apportioned fee. It is charged to all
vehicles, all commercial motor vehicles, regardless of
whether it's for-hire or private, regardless of it's in-
state or -- of interstate. So everybody pays their
apportioned amount based on mileage.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that shows -- that --
maybe I don't understand. That -- that tells us what happens
to the money after it's paid, but it doesn't make any
difference to the person who is paying the money, does it?
MR. HANSON: Yes, it does.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Except that he only has to pay
in one place, and -- and if they --
MR. HANSON: He pays --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- increase the registration
fee, he'd only have to pay in one place, once.
MR. HANSON: But he would only pay the fee based
on his mileage in the State. It is not a flat fee if it
is put onto the IRP fees. Those --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who -- who sets the fee for
the plating?
MR. HANSON: The -- the State does. It is
administered by the Michigan Secretary of State --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So --
MR. HANSON: -- but I believe all of those are
statutory fees.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you could have -- unlike
the -- the fee, the $10 fee, that --
MR. HANSON: The SSRS.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the Federal cap, this
would -- for plating it could be anything each individual
State chooses it to be?
MR. HANSON: In terms of the plating fee?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. HANSON: Each State is free to charge its --
its own amount as the plating fee.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but it -- so -- so
regardless of what Michigan does with the apportioned
amounts, the amount it charges to the -- to the owner, in
the case of the -- the plating fee, is -- is simply set by
the State of Michigan.
MR. HANSON: That is --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
MR. HANSON: -- that is correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So what -- and -- and the --
the virtue of the apportionment is that the -- that the
owner or the -- or the owner, I guess in this case, does
not have to pay fees in 49 other States.
MR. HANSON: That is correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But he doesn't -- it doesn't
matter to -- that's the value to him. It doesn't matter
to him how they apportion whatever that fee is that
Michigan charges.
MR. HANSON: If they apportion it, however, it
is -- it is not -- it does not -- if they put it into the
IRP, it is not part of the registration process. The
thing that the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But who -- I mean, is -- that's
-- that's fine as a matter of administration, but in terms
of the -- the end effect on the person who has to pay it
and on the consumers to whom it is ultimately passed on,
what difference does it make?
MR. HANSON: Well, the -- the difference for the
person who is paying it under IRP is that if only 20
percent of their interstate miles as a solely interstate
operating carrier, if only 20 percent are in the State,
they would, in fact, only pay $20 per vehicle.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask a quick question?
The -- there are three things. Were -- were you finished?
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't think he -- I
didn't --
JUSTICE BREYER: Sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand your answer.
If you were finished, I don't understand.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MR. HANSON: If it's -- if it is put into a
plating charge as opposed to a registration -- part of the
registration of a carrier for the privilege or the
opportunity to carry on interstate trucking activities in
the State of Michigan, that is the flat fee that we're
talking about. Under the SSRS we believe that $100 charge
exceeds the $10 maximum and is therefore preempted.
If they put it into the IRP, that -- IRP is
charged against the owner of the vehicle, paid against the
Secretary of -- paid to the Secretary of State. It is not
a qualification under -- for the privilege of engaging in
interstate trucking in the State of Michigan.
The SSRS sets up the standards by which a
carrier becomes qualified to operate in the State.
Michigan exceeds those standards. If you put those fees
into the IRP fees, then the carrier -- or then the owner
of the vehicle pays only the proportionate amount based on
his mileage in the State.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?
Supposing the -- Michigan changed its system and said
we're going to charge you $90 for -- as a plating fee.
We're only talking about vehicles that are plated in
Michigan. We're going to charge you $90 for a plating fee
and now we're going to take 10 -- what used to part of the
$100 and another $10 registration fee. Would that be
permissible?
MR. HANSON: It would be permissible because the
-- if the $10 is charged to the carrier as part of the
registration process, in order to be qualified to engage
in interstate trucking. The $90 would be charged to the
owner of the vehicle and would be paid on an apportioned
basis under IRP.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. What if he said $20
instead of $10?
MR. HANSON: If he said $20 was going to be put
towards the -- the State instead of -- instead of $100?
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
MR. HANSON: And $80 towards IRP?
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
MR. HANSON: In that case, that would still
violate the -- the SSRS, if it is done as part of the
registration process, which is what Michigan does.
Michigan -- even though you're properly SSRS registered,
Michigan still requires, under its SSRS form -- it directs
the carrier to specifically identify vehicles by make,
model, and serial number to obtain a decal by paying $100
for that fee. If they pay $20, that exceeds the $10
maximum that Congress set up in the SSRS in order to be
qualified to operate in interstate trucking in the State
of Michigan, as an interstate carrier in -- in Michigan.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- that assumes it's
an SSRS charge, and the State denies that it -- it has
anything to do with SSRS. Don't you have to establish
that it's part of the SSRS program?
MR. HANSON: I think what you have to do is you
have to look at what the -- the standards do. The -- the
registration standards in the SSRS are set up as the
process by which a carrier has the privilege to enter into
interstate trucking activities in Michigan. When you look
at the statute --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but what -- what if the
State says, you can enter -- enter into interstate
activities for nothing? We're simply going to increase
the registration fee by $100. Couldn't the State do that?
MR. HANSON: The State could do that and that
would be perfectly permissible.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So this is pure formalism.
MR. HANSON: It is not pure form. Any -- what
-- what Congress did was say that in order to qualify a
carrier -- they were concerned about the burdens. When
ISTEA was enacted in 1991, they were concerned about the
burdens on carriers of individual State registration
requirements. And they sought to -- to alleviate that by
making it so that carriers could only -- would only have
to register in one State so they could do business in all
States on an interstate basis.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe they sought to but maybe
they didn't succeed. As I read the statute, it -- it
really applies to the -- the limitation of $10 only to
those fees that are SSRS fees, and these are not. So
maybe there's -- there's a hole in the Federal statute.
MR. HANSON: And I don't believe that's the
case, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're trying to make the
Federal statute work sensibly, but --
MR. HANSON: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I hate to tell you, but not
all statutes work sensibly.
MR. HANSON: Right.
I think what you have to do, though, is go back
and look at what Michigan does. Michigan has a -- a State
statute, 478.7(1), that says in order to operate to carry
property on an interstate basis in Michigan, you must
register with the PSC and you must pay the required
vehicle fees. The registration standards are what they do
as in accordance with SSRS: insurance, service of
process, and operating authority. Then you have to pay a
fee, and the fee is limited to $10 per vehicle.
In the case of Michigan, those vehicle fees are
set forth in two different sections of the statutes. One
is .7(4), which is the $10 SSRS fee. The other one is
subsection -- it's 2(2). That fee is $100 --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Hanson.
MR. HANSON: -- in order for a Michigan-plated
vehicle to engage in interstate commerce.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Your time is expired.
MR. HANSON: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Boynton, we'll
hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY J. BOYNTON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BOYNTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The petitioner, American Trucking, began its
reply brief with the claim that the central reality in
this case is that the Michigan intrastate fee places
significant burdens on interstate commerce. The Michigan
Court of Appeals rejected this claim squarely, saying that
as a matter of -- that that was a matter of pure
speculation.
There's no evidence in the record before this
Court that the trucking companies' route choices are
affected by the intrastate fee. Furthermore, there is no
evidence in the record that the intrastate fee keeps
anyone out from engaging in intrastate trucking in
Michigan.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It sure does make sense to me,
though. Surely it's the case that a company that does
nothing but intrastate Michigan business will, by and
large, log in many more miles intrastate than a company
which does interstate business but part of its business is
intrastate Michigan business. I -- I just -- it seems to
me obvious that --
MR. BOYNTON: Well, the Michigan Court of
Appeals said that that very well may be the case, but they
pointed to the fact that there were no facts to support
that finding.
And this is completely different than in
Scheiner. In Scheiner you had a -- a trial, you had
evidence before the court. This Court noted that the --
the cost to an interstate trucker in that situation was
five times greater than the cost to a trucker that was in
Pennsylvania. You just simply don't have those facts
here.
What you have is a discrete or a distinct local
activity that is something that doesn't affect the
interstate commerce.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it's the case that a
company that does only intrastate Michigan business logs
all of its miles on -- in Michigan. Right? No miles
outside of Michigan.
MR. BOYNTON: That's right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And it seems to me it's obvious
that a -- a company that does interstate business does not
log all of its miles in -- in Michigan, and likely --
likely -- very likely does -- does less miles in Michigan
than -- than a purely intrastate Michigan trucker.
MR. BOYNTON: Well, Justice Scalia, that very
well may be true, but we don't have any way of -- of
qualifying or quantifying the burden here because we don't
have those facts.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it difficult to apportion
the intrastate fee based on the number of miles traveled
intrastate?
MR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I -- I think it
is very difficult to do that. As the United States noted
in its brief, they didn't think that mileage would be
appropriate because this -- this fee doesn't support the
maintenance of the highways. What this fee does is allows
trucking companies or allows that truck to operate that
truck in intrastate business. So mileage isn't
appropriate.
Our position is that mileage isn't appropriate
because it's next to impossible to try and figure out.
What do you compare it to? Do you -- do you compare it to
interstate miles? Do you compare it to a ratio of
interstate -- intrastate to interstate? And if you do
that, how -- how can you come up with a accurate picture
of, you know, what the value of that license is in
Michigan? It may be --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it make any difference
how high the -- the fee is set? If it were $10,000 a
truck, does that raise any concerns that are different?
MR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, the Michigan
Court of Appeals had taken the position that this was a
fee, not a tax, and under a fee -- if -- if a fee was
$10,000, if the expenses matched the -- the revenue from
it, well, then it -- it would be a -- could be sustained
as a fee. Now, if were a tax --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you defend that
position, that -- that it doesn't violate the Commerce
Clause so long as it's a fee not a tax?
MR. BOYNTON: Your Honor, we think that the --
if it's a fee and not a tax, the Michigan Court of Appeals
applied the correct standard, and that was the standard of
Pike v. Bruce Church. And you would look to the --
whether the statute regulated even-handedly, whether it
affected a legitimate local --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Whenever it's a fee, not a tax,
you immediately go to Pike Church.
MR. BOYNTON: I think that -- that that was what
the Michigan Court of Appeals --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I know. I know that's what
they said.
MR. BOYNTON: Yes, and I -- I think that's a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I found it very strange.
MR. BOYNTON: I think that's an appropriate
manner in dealing with it.
But if you -- if you look at the Michigan Court
of Appeals opinion --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What makes it a fee instead
of a tax other than the court saying so?
MR. BOYNTON: Well, first of all, it provided a
direct benefit to the intrastate truckers. They were able
to operate in the State of Michigan. Second of all, they
pointed out that it was in relation to the services
granted, being able to do that, and then the third
component would be the voluntariness, whether they could
agree to -- they didn't have to engage in intrastate
trucking --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You could say the same about a
tax. You could say, you know, you only have to pay this
tax if you operate in Michigan. You don't want to
operate; you don't have to pay it. And you could also say
unless you pay the tax, you cannot operate in Michigan.
Does that make it a tax or a fee?
MR. BOYNTON: Well, I think in the Michigan
Court of Appeals opinion, it -- it was a fee, and I think
-- I think what we come back to, Your Honor, is the idea
is there a specific class of individuals or businesses
that are benefitted. And I think that that's the
distinction between a fee and tax.
Also, a tax is a general revenue-raising
measure, whereas a fee is not. And that's another
distinction of -- of a tax. And indeed, this Court -- in
National Cable Industry v. the United States, which we
cited in our brief, this Court said as whether an exaction
is a tax or a fee depends on whether its purpose is to
raise revenue or regulate an industry or services.
One of the things --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd like to get back just for
a moment --
MR. BOYNTON: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to the answer you gave
about apportionment because I wasn't quite sure I
understood the answer. You said, well, apportionment is
very difficult. What are you supposed to do? What are
you -- what's the base? Well, and you said, should we
apportion against -- between in-state and out-of-state,
and I would think the answer is yes. That's the whole
point.
MR. BOYNTON: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if we're talking about
mileage here, maybe this is something that's eminently
susceptible of apportionment. Now, it may be that
administratively this is just too expensive. That may be
-- that may be a very valid argument.
But so far as saying that there's no basis for
apportionment, I didn't understand your answer.
MR. BOYNTON: Well, I -- I -- maybe I misspoke
myself. What I really meant to say was it would be very
difficult to do. And in our joint appendix -- in the
joint appendix --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It would be difficult to do
administratively. But -- just because of the cost of
collecting all the --
MR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I think that you
got to look at what's the total cost here. The cost is
not only to the administrative aspect by the State, but
this imposes another cost on the truckers.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that -- I agree that
that is expensive. However, it seems to me that it would
be easier to do it with trucks which have miles than
with --
MR. BOYNTON: But, Your Honor, the problem is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- than with, say, attorneys
or accountants or whatever.
MR. BOYNTON: Your Honor, the problem with that
is that this fee, this intrastate fee, does not go to
maintain the highways as it was in Scheiner. They make
the argument that it's very easy that the mechanism --
they, being American Trucking, makes the argument that
it's very easy to just start logging up the miles and --
and you have the mechanism there.
But the difference between Scheiner and this
case is that in Scheiner you were measuring all intrastate
miles, any miles traveled within that State. And there's
a mechanism available administratively to do that. The
IRP requires that.
But here you're not logging all intrastate
miles. You're only logging those miles in the State that
involve a point-to-point delivery, from one intrastate
point to another. So you don't -- you'd have to get a
whole new record keeping or you'd have to keep track of a
while different set of miles than you would with respect
to the IRP.
And that's the thing that I find striking about
this, that the American Trucking Association is basically
saying to its members that they want to have them do more
record keeping on their part.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the American Trucking
Association is -- is willing to be thrown into the -- into
the briar bush apparently. It certainly involves no -- no
difficulty for your Michigan intrastate truckers. All of
their miles are intrastate. And the plaintiffs here say
we're -- we're willing to -- you know, to provide figures
showing how much of our carriage was -- was exclusively
intrastate if you want to apportion.
MR. BOYNTON: Well, that may be, Your Honor, but
the -- the point is -- what we're dealing with is a -- a
fee that has revenues of about $3 million. And if you
have additional record keeping, how much of that $3
million is going to have to be devoted to paying for the
administrative costs that are involved?
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? Is
the fee payable before the -- a carrier may engage in
business or is it after the carrier has paid? Is it -- is
it like a tax that's paid after the year is out?
MR. BOYNTON: It's paid before. They -- they
have to have --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If you had to pay it before,
there would be no way to calculate it ahead of time
because nobody would have had any mileage. Isn't that
correct?
MR. BOYNTON: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE STEVENS: If you have to pay it before
the year begins and before you're allowed to engage in the
business, you would have no way of measuring the number of
miles you're going to travel during the -- the ensuing
year.
MR. BOYNTON: That's correct. You would have to
have --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose that's the same
thing for the $10 fee for the whatever the acronym is
there. That's paid at the beginning of the year, isn't
it? And it has to be apportioned among the States. And
you don't know how to apportion it at the beginning of the
year.
MR. BOYNTON: Now, you're talking about the
interstate fee, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, right. But I'm saying
the same problem arises when you do any apportioning.
MR. BOYNTON: Well, it -- let me back up. The
reason I asked with you -- when you were referring to the
$10 fee is because the intrastate fee -- we have a $10
component in that as well. You can obtain a temporary fee
for $10 for 72 hours to conduct an intrastate operation.
So the statute in -- structurally has some apportionment
factor in it. So you don't have to necessarily buy the
$100 intrastate fee decal to conduct intrastate
operations.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's like a 3-day fishing
license.
MR. BOYNTON: I suppose that would be one way --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how does that work in
-- in practice? Is it easily accessible? Suppose the
company --
MR. BOYNTON: Well --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- wants to fill up its truck
and -- and it said, well, this is going to be -- the only
haul this season for me, so I want the 3-day permit.
MR. BOYNTON: Yes, Your Honor, you can obtain
the permits in advance. You don't have to have trucks
lined up at the border waiting to get a decal or get a
permit. You can purchase them in advance. So that --
that's available to the truckers.
The one thing I should mention, though, is you
have to have one -- you already have to have one vehicle
licensed intrastate. You already have to have paid the
fee on one vehicle, and then you would be eligible to
purchase additional temporary permits as the need arose
based on seasonal needs or an emergency situation. So
that -- that allows the -- the statute -- I -- I would
submit to Your Honor, allows some apportioning in and of
itself.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- this applies only to
operations that are both licensed and registered in
Michigan. Is that so?
MR. BOYNTON: No. Your Honor I think is
referring to the interstate fee --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right, right, yes.
MR. BOYNTON: -- which is a different fee, which
is in the Mid-Con case.
Our position --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you going to address the
Mid-Con question?
MR. BOYNTON: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you going to address the
Mid-Con question?
MR. BOYNTON: I was going to do that right now,
Your Honor.
The position that the State of Michigan and the
Michigan Public Service Commission has is the SSRS does
not preempt the interstate fee. And the reason for that
is --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what's the point of the
limitation in SSRS to $10 if the State can impose any
additional fee it wants just by calling it a different
name?
MR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I think what you
have to realize is you have -- when you look at the text
of the statute, I think what is very clear from reading
the text is that the SSRS does not preempt all State fees
and charges on motor carriers. It only preempts those
fees and charges that are specifically related to the
registration of that motor carrier's interstate authority.
The interstate fee, or the Michigan-plated vehicle fee
here, is not preempted because it's a regulatory fee that
does not relate to the registration of the motor carrier's
SSRS interstate authority.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, it -- it does.
Number one, it's somewhat suspect at the outset because it
applies only to interstate travel.
MR. BOYNTON: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and then the -- the
other vehicles pay $100 for the -- for the in-state fees,
and so this seems to me that -- that on -- on its face
shows that it's like a registration fee.
MR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I think a couple
things. Number one, I think that -- I believe that if you
look at the structure of the Michigan statute, you'll see
that under section 2, which contains both the interstate
fee and the intrastate fee, virtually all Michigan
vehicles that are plated in Michigan -- the effect of it
is that all vehicles that are plated in Michigan will have
paid this $100 fee.
And furthermore, if you look at section 7 of the
Michigan statute, which is 478.7, that involves the
registration procedure. That's specifically applicable to
the registration of interstate authority. And within that
section 7, subsection (4) deals with the payment of the
$10 fee for -- and -- and it's to be made by vehicles that
are not plated in the State of Michigan.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's the problem.
MR. BOYNTON: Well, that's the argument.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the problem because here
we're dealing with the fee to be paid by the people who
are plated in Michigan, and it looks like that $100 is the
fee for them.
Well, let me -- I have a question. I'm trying
to test this. Suppose that I have a company in Maine.
All right? And I have -- I decide all my -- I -- I have
all Maine plates, by the way. And I decide I want my --
now, let's -- one word is license plates. I'm going to
talk about plating. Another word is the ICC insurance.
Let's call it a decal. And the third kind of a concept is
whatever you refer to in your statute by a fee. All
right? The $100.
MR. BOYNTON: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, suppose in
Maine what I do with my trucks is I say I want Michigan to
be my home State for purposes of -- what do you call it?
The SS?
MR. BOYNTON: SSRS.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And so I go to Michigan,
and now I pay all the registration fees here. Do I get a
-- a certificate of some kind, a decal or something to
show I did it?
MR. BOYNTON: No. Your Honor, I -- I -- you say
that you're a Maine company --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. BOYNTON: -- but your principal place of
business is in Michigan?
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes. So -- that's right.
MR. BOYNTON: Okay. And your question is?
JUSTICE BREYER: Do I get a decal after I go
through all this procedure? You have a whole form. I pay
$6 for Alabama. I pay $2 for Idaho, and -- but -- but I
do it all in one shopping place which happens to be
Michigan.
MR. BOYNTON: Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER: Then do I get a little
certificate to put on the truck to say I did it. I -- I
registered my ICC decal everywhere.
MR. BOYNTON: If that vehicle -- if the vehicle
you're registering is plated in Michigan --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, it's not.
MR. BOYNTON: Okay. You will pay nothing.
JUSTICE BREYER: I know for Michigan. But I
have to pay. But Michigan is my -- I can't ask the
question until I get clear on this.
MR. BOYNTON: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE BREYER: Don't -- when I -- when I go
under this -- this 49 U.S.C. 14504 and I choose a home
State --
MR. BOYNTON: That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and I make all the relevant
payments to that State, but they distribute, don't I get a
piece of paper saying I did it?
MR. BOYNTON: I believe so, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Now, I'm now plated in
Michigan, and I make Michigan my home State for this. And
I go and I make -- I say, Michigan, I'm going to give you
this big check to distribute, but the amount I'm putting
here for Michigan, by the way, is zero. And you say pay
me $100. No. I'm not going to do it. So I haven't paid
them the $100. I haven't paid Michigan everything, but I
paid $2 for Idaho. Do I get the decal or don't I?
MR. BOYNTON: To get a decal from Michigan, you
have to be Michigan-plated and you have to pay the $100.
JUSTICE BREYER: Excellent. Now, if I don't get
the decal, because I didn't pay the $100, then that $100
is a charge that falls within the SSI. It is a charge for
a decal which shows that I registered the ICC and my
insurance because otherwise, if it weren't, you'd give me
the decal.
MR. BOYNTON: Your Honor, we believe that under
the -- the section 7 of the Michigan law, there is no fee
charged for your SSRS.
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm talking about a fee. I'm
trying to -- oh, fine. If there's no fee charged and I
didn't pay the $100 and I didn't pay anything else, you'd
give me the decal. But you said you wouldn't.
MR. BOYNTON: Your Honor, you have to -- you
have to -- if it's Michigan-plated, that's the triggering
mechanism. It's not the -- that's -- that's what triggers
the $100 fee.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Boynton, may I just -- may
I just ask this question? Is part of your position that
the Federal statute does not prevent Michigan from waiving
the $10 fee on -- for this particular purpose?
MR. BOYNTON: Our position, with respect to
that, Your Honor, is the fact that under section 7 of the
Michigan Motor Carrier Act, 478.7, Michigan has no
authority to charge a Michigan-plated vehicle any fee at
all.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. So that -- but you're
saying to Justice Breyer then is they have waived the $10
and they do it to a narrow class, those vehicles who are
plated in Michigan because they've already charged them
$100, a very heavy charge for the privilege of being
plated.
MR. BOYNTON: Well, I don't know if I'm saying
that, Your Honor. I'm saying that the -- there's a zero
charge, and then there's -- there's another charge with
respect to a vehicle fee.
The one thing that I need to point out here is
that the SSRS is not vehicle-specific. It talks about
numbers of vehicles, but the Michigan decal fee for -- or
the interstate fee is vehicle-specific. You have to
identify the particular --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? Let me -- let
me -- I wanted to ask this question to see whether it's
vehicle-specific. Suppose I have nine trucks. They're
Michigan-plated, so I have to pay $100 for each of the
nine.
MR. BOYNTON: Interstate commerce.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, suppose I -- suppose I
only pay the fee for eight of them. What happens?
MR. BOYNTON: And how do you want to use the
truck? Do you want to use it in interstate commerce?
JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I've paid for eight, but I
haven't paid for the ninth. As I read the Michigan law,
it says shall not operate any motor vehicle upon or over
the highways of this State while any of the fees imposed
by this act remain unpaid. Now, if -- if I can't operate
the other eight because I haven't paid for the nine, that
sounds to me like a vehicle-specific tax.
MR. BOYNTON: Yes, it is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean -- I mean the opposite.
It's -- it's not vehicle-specific.
MR. BOYNTON: Oh.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I've paid for the eight, and I
can't operate at all because I haven't paid for the ninth.
MR. BOYNTON: Well, I think administratively
that -- that wouldn't happen. I -- I think once you go --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me how it reads.
Am I reading the law wrong? It says, shall not operate
any motor vehicle while any of the fees imposed by this
act remain unpaid.
MR. BOYNTON: I suppose that if the -- for --
for nonpayment of fees, a motor carrier risks its
authority to operate in the State.
JUSTICE SCALIA: At all. So it's not really
vehicle-specific.
MR. BOYNTON: Well, I -- I think it is. I would
disagree with Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the computation is
vehicle-specific, but you're using all the vehicles as
hostage for the payment of -- of any shortfall. That's
what you're doing, isn't it?
JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's carrier-based.
MR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I would have to
disagree with Your Honor respectfully. I think that the
-- that it is vehicle-specific because it identifies the
particular vehicle that's involved here. And I -- I think
you have to read the statute, the preemption statute, the
scope of what preemption has sought to do here, and not
all State fees and charges on motor carrier vehicles are
preempted.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you place any reliance in
this scheme on the fact that the only people subject to it
are people who have their principal place of business in
Michigan?
MR. BOYNTON: No, Your Honor. The triggering
event for the interstate fee is the plating of the vehicle
in Michigan.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and anyone can choose to
do that? I mean, going back to Justice Breyer's example,
anybody can say, well, I think I'd like to be plated in
Michigan even though I operate in -- in other States. My
principal place of business is in another State.
MR. BOYNTON: Right. I think all parties have
noted, Your Honor, that the -- under the SSRS it's much
more stringent, more rigorous --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm just asking about what
you do in Michigan.
MR. BOYNTON: Yes. Yes, you can.
JUSTICE SOUTER: You really can do that?
MR. BOYNTON: You can plate wherever you have
contacts with the State. If your principal place of
business is in Ohio but you have trucks going to and from
Michigan, that -- that would allow you to plate in State
of Michigan.
JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you can plate your whole
fleet in Michigan under those circumstances.
MR. BOYNTON: You could -- you can choose where
to plate your feet -- plate your trucks, and a number of
considerations go into that. It's not just the license
plating fees. It has everything to do -- as we noted in
our brief, it could have to do with no fault insurance,
the weight limits on trucks. It's an economic decision
and there's a number of different factors that go into
that decision of where to plate a vehicle.
In conclusion, I would say that the Michigan
Court of Appeals correctly decided this case. And they --
they found that the challenged fees in these cases are
regulatory fees, that they serve the critical function of
protecting the people of Michigan that use the highways.
And the Michigan Court of Appeals should be affirmed.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
Boynton.
Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS IN NO. 03-1230 AND
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1234
MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The United States as amicus curiae supports the
State in American Trucking and the petitioner in Mid-Con.
With respect to American Trucking, in our view
the central question in resolving the constitutional issue
is not whether it would be possible to apportion the
intrastate fee on a more precise basis. The question is
whether the Constitution requires it.
And in the prior cases that we've cited in our
brief, both the older cases dealing specifically with
intrastate transportation and the more recent cases
dealing with authority to engage in other intrastate
businesses, this Court has repeatedly upheld the authority
of States and municipalities to charge flat fees for the
privilege of engaging in the local business within the
jurisdiction during the -- the relevant period of time.
And that practice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to me really to
go back on -- on Scheiner. And I thought we tried to get
away from deciding Commerce Clause questions on the basis
of whether it is interstate commerce or local commerce,
you know, the original package doctrine and things that
succeeded it. And you're -- you're just dragging back in
this -- this inquiry into whether it's really interstate
or -- or rather local.
MR. STEWART: Well, with -- with respect, Your
Honor, I think the Court has certainly abandoned the
notion that there is a bright, absolute line between
intrastate activities which are subject to plenary
regulation by the States without any Commerce Clause
inquiry and interstate commerce which is wholly immune
from State regulation. The Court has recognized that the
question is more complicated than that.
But in cases like Jefferson Lines, for instance,
the Court held that the sales price of a ticket for an
interstate bus trip could be taxed in -- in its entirety
by the State in which the ticket was purchased because the
sale of the ticket was regarded as a separate, discrete
event properly severable from the underlying interstate
transaction.
And the case for severance is all the more
powerful here. That is, here we're dealing not with a --
an aspect of an interstate transaction, we're dealing with
point-to-point hauls within the State of Michigan. It's
true that those may be undertaken by trucks that also do
interstate business, and it's even true that in some
instances the intrastate load may be carried on the same
truck at the same time that it's also carrying goods
between the States. But the intrastate haul is itself a
discrete commercial transaction. To the shipper it's
wholly irrelevant, in most instances, that the -- the
truck is also doing an interstate business.
And to differentiate this case from Scheiner,
one of the things that the Court has looked at in the
dormant Commerce Clause inquiry is the risk of multiple
taxation. And the Court doesn't just mean multiple
taxation in -- in the abstract because it's necessarily
going to be the case that an entity that does business in
many States will be taxed in many States. Rather the
question is whether there's an undue risk of multiple
taxation on the same transaction or the same conduct or
the same activity.
And that was at real risk in Scheiner because if
you imagine a truck that's delivering cargo from Maine to
Florida and passing through several States on the way, and
it's required to pay a fee that is, in essence, a fee for
entering the State, has nothing to do with the mileage
traveled within the jurisdiction, it's entirely reasonable
to say that the imposition of those cumulative trips --
cumulative taxes for a single haul of goods from Maine to
Florida is an instance of multiple taxation of the same
event.
Here we don't have a problem with that. The tax
is being levied solely on point-to-point hauls within the
State of Michigan. If a particular truck also makes
point-to-point hauls in some other State within the
calendar year, it may be subject to two taxes, but they
can't be characterized as two taxes on the same conduct or
the same transaction.
The second aspect of -- of Scheiner --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, it could. I mean, if --
if this -- this truck is making one -- one haul, it's
carrying some goods from Texas to -- to Maine, but some
other goods it picks up along the way within Tennessee and
just carries it to another place within Tennessee, and
then it picks some other goods in New Jersey, carries it
elsewhere to New Jersey, you're going to be taxed. It
seems to me it's -- it's one trip.
We never used to -- used to divide railroads on
the basis of well, the ICC has jurisdiction over just the
interstate portions and -- and the two stops within a
State can be regulated by the State.
MR. STEWART: I mean, I think you're right that
it wouldn't be reasonable to regard the within-Texas
segment or the within-Oklahoma segment of a transfer of
goods between States as a discrete, separable event. But
if the truck is picking up goods at one point in Texas and
depositing them at another point in Texas, again from the
shipper's point of view, that's clearly a discrete
transaction. The shipper is unlikely to have any interest
in whether the same truck is simultaneously carrying goods
among the States. And it's reasonable to regard that as a
discrete event that is taxable by the State in which it
occurs.
The other point to make about Scheiner is that
even if we assume, as the petitioner argues, that the
average interstate truck that makes some point-to-point
hauls within Michigan will do so less frequently than the
average truck that does business solely within that State,
there's still a whole different class of interstate
truckers that makes substantial use of Michigan's roads
that could be charged taxes on the basis of mileage
traveled and they're being let off the hook because the
State has chosen to focus this tax on intrastate activity.
Petitioners' response to this is that you can't
discriminate against one class and then make up for it by
-- by discriminating in favor of a different class.
And if this were, to use title VII terminology,
a disparate treatment case, we would agree. That is, if a
State overtly discriminates against one class of
interstate or out-of-state activities and on the face of
the law those people are treated less favorably, then we
would entirely agree that the State couldn't make up for
it by giving more favorable treatment to a different class
of out-of-state entities.
But here the petitioner is making what amounts
to a disparate impact claim, and the essence of a
disparate impact claim is not that any particular
individual has suffered unfair treatment. The way you
prove a disparate impact claim is to show the effect
cumulatively upon the class, upon interstate truckers in
this case in the aggregate. And there's really no way to
feel any kind of confidence that interstate truckers won't
do better as a group by virtue of Michigan's decision to
focus this tax on intrastate activity rather than on the
basis of mileage, which would sweep in a lot of out-of-
state truckers that are not currently covered.
I'd like to speak briefly at least about the --
the Mid-Con case. And in our view the best way of
understanding -- to -- to return to the historical
antecedents of the current SSRS provision, in its original
form, as enacted in 1965, the statute said it's not an
unreasonable burden of -- on interstate commerce to
require an interstate carrier to register its Federal
certificate so along as you do so in accordance with the
standards of the ICC. If you go beyond those standards,
it's an unreasonable burden on commerce.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'd like to know the text you
rely on.
MR. STEWART: That was --
JUSTICE SCALIA: For -- for preemption, the text
of the current statute that you rely on.
MR. STEWART: The text of the current statute is
set forth at page 82 of the appendix to the certiorari
petition in Mid-Con, and it's now 49 U.S.C. 14504(b). And
the statute says, the first sentence, the requirement of a
State that a motor carrier providing transportation
subject to jurisdiction under subchapter 1 of chapter 135
-- and that refers to interstate transportation --
providing interstate transportation and providing
transportation in that State must register with the State
is not an unreasonable burden on transportation referred
to in section 13501.
JUSTICE SCALIA: 13501 deals just with SSRS.
MR. STEWART: No. 13501 is the provision that
-- that defines the general regulatory jurisdiction of the
Department of Transportation and the Surface
Transportation Board. And it basically says these
agencies have general regulatory jurisdiction over
transportation between points in one State and points in
another State and -- or between points in the same State
passing through another State. So in -- in using that
shorthand reference, the Congress just means interstate
transportation.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?
Because I know your time is short. Supposing Michigan
imposed a new $10 fee per -- and it identified it
precisely as in order to comply with that statute and then
reduced its present plating fee from $100 to $90, would
that be permissible?
MR. STEWART: Well, as long as the -- again, to
-- in our view the distinctive and disqualifying feature
of the current statute is that subsection (2) is imposed
specifically on vehicles that operate entirely in
interstate commerce. And if Michigan reduced to $90 the
extra --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not saying -- they reduced
to $90 the plating fee, but then they enacted a new $10
fee specifically designed to comply with the statute.
MR. STEWART: As long as --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Could they do that?
MR. STEWART: As long as they were still
imposing that additional -- again --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The $90 is for plating. It
said only -- only Michigan-plated vehicles pay the $90.
Everybody else -- everybody -- and everybody also pays the
$10.
MR. STEWART: As long as that $90 fee was
imposed not just on Michigan-plated vehicles generally,
but specifically on Michigan-plated vehicles that operate
entirely in interstate commerce, we would say that's
preempted because our reading of the statute is that
basically Congress has said there's a severe limit on what
you can do to interstate carriers that you don't do to
intrastate carriers.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does it say that? Let --
let me come back to the -- to the section of the statute
you're quoting. You didn't finish the sentence. It says
that it's not an unreasonable burden when the State
registration is completed under standards of the Secretary
under subsection (c). Subsection (c) is entitled SSRS,
Single State Registration System.
MR. STEWART: May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Briefly.
MR. STEWART: The State doesn't argue that this
registration was completed in accordance with this
standard. It argues that the provision doesn't apply at
all because this is not the sort of registration
requirement that the statute speaks of. We think it is
because it's imposed strictly on interstate carriers.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
Stewart.
Mr. Digges, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT DIGGES, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1230
MR. DIGGES: Thank you. I'd like to just
briefly cover three points.
First, I believe that -- that is accurate to say
that the Solicitor General's position is returning us to
the pre-Complete Auto days of line-drawing, but more than
that, the Solicitor General's position is ignoring the
practical effect of these fees on taxpayers. I think the
-- the citation to the Peddler v. Drummer line of cases
illustrates that.
The only difference between the Peddler cases
and the Drummer cases was that in the -- in the Nippert
case and -- and the Drummer case, they looked at the
practical effect on an out-of-state salesman and whether
that salesman would be discouraged by the $50 fee that was
being imposed from coming into the State. In the Wagner
case, they simply said that the fee fell on an essentially
local event, didn't look at the form of the fee, didn't
look at the form of the fee on the out-of-state salesman.
I don't think it can be disputed that to out-of-state --
that out-of-state salesmen would be equally discouraged
from coming into a State because a $50 fee or a $100 fee,
whether or not they're carrying the goods with them in at
that time or whether the goods are later mailed in.
So, again, I think it is returning to the line-
drawing issues, and really there is no test that is made as
to, after you -- you draw these lines, what the appropriate
test should be.
The second point is it -- with respect to the
administrative practicality of apportioning these fees.
The purpose of apportionment would not be, as in a highway
tax, to -- to show the amount of highway damage that was
done by a truck. The purpose of apportionment here is
simply to show the extent of the taxpayer's level of
activity in the State. It would be like a general revenue
tax in which we're trying to allocate the taxpayer's
activity to particular States, make sure that that
taxpayer is paying its fair share of the State's costs
with respect -- of the State's generic costs, in this
case, generic regulatory costs. So, again, I think that
apportionment would be very easy.
As Justice Scalia said, the trucking industry is
willing to take the onus of this. We bill by the mile.
You could do it on number of loads. You could do it in a
lot -- a lot of ways. And by apportioning the fee, you
eliminate the burden and you make the out-of-state
carrier, who would be otherwise prohibited from only
hauling a load or two -- he would then have the ability to
haul that load and -- and not be discriminated against.
The final area I'd like to talk about a little
bit is the need for additional -- the need for evidence in
this case. Again, in the Nippert and the Scheiner cases,
there -- they -- they -- it was expressly said that there
was no need for evidence in the cases because in the
general average of instances, the out-of-state trucker
will always pay more than the in-state trucker.
And in answer to your question, Justice Stevens,
I think it was recognized in those cases that there would
be some exceptions to that rule. There would be a few
out-of-state carriers that would operate more heavily in
the State than in-state carriers. But that exception
wasn't -- wasn't what was going to happen and the most
often, and that the average of instances, it would always
work to the disadvantage of the out-of-state carriers.
And -- and the final point is that with respect
to evidence, you have here also a failure of internal
consistency test, and this Court has said a number of
times that failure internal -- of internal consistency is
not a test related -- it doesn't rely on specific facts
but it relies on hypotheticals.
And in this instance, I think there's a very
clear failure of internal consistency. Like in Scheiner,
there's a cumulative burden on an out-of-state trucker.
If a trucker wants to operate in intrastate commerce
around the country, it has to -- and just haul one load in
every State, it has to pay 48 times a $100 fee or pay
$4,800 in eligible -- in order to be eligible to haul in
all of those States. So that illustrates how that's going
to balkanize commerce, that that carrier is not going to
be able to pay that kind of entrance fee nationwide. So
that carrier will operate in less intrastate activities in
-- in only a few States or maybe none.
And again, we think that that defeats the
purpose. When Congress passed economic deregulation of
the trucking industry, that they wanted to open it up to
out-of-state carriers to be able to augment their
interstate loads.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Digges.
