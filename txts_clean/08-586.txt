CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 08-586, Jones v.
Harris Associates.
Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK: Thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
In 1970, Congress amended the Investment
Company Act to provide a cause of action when an
investment adviser breaches its fiduciary duty with
respect to compensation.
The Seventh Circuit upheld summary judgment
for Respondent under a legal standard for fiduciary duty
that Respondent here no longer defends.
For three reasons, the Seventh Circuit's
judgment should be reversed. First, under the Court's
longstanding precedent, in this context a fiduciary duty
requires a fair fee, achieved through full disclosure
and good-faith negotiation.
Second, the best gauge of a fair fee is what
the investment adviser charges at arm's-length in other
transactions for similar services.
And, third, applying that standard here,
Harris charged twice as much in percentage terms for
providing virtually identical advisory services in
arm's-length transactions with institutional investors.
With respect to the first point, the
standard for fiduciary duty has been clear from this
Court's cases, at least since Pepper v. Litton, in which
the Court said that a fair result in the
circumstances -- a fair fee -- was an important
component of a fiduciary duty.
Congress was aware of that standard when it
enacted the 1970 amendments to the Investment Company
Act. The SEC brought the case to the Congress'
attention, and that standard, we submit, is one that
Congress intended to incorporate.
Applying that standard, where Pepper said
that the best gauge of a fair fee is what the person --
the fiduciary charges in arm's-length transactions,
applied here, the best way to understand how that
fiduciary duty is being breached in this context is what
Harris is charging for same or similar services at
arm's-length to institutional investors.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is Harris a fiduciary in
the same sense as a corporate officer and a corporate
director? Or does his fiduciary duty differ? Is it
higher or lower, same with a guardian, same with a
trustee?
I mean, the word "fiduciary" -- does
fiduciary imply different standards, depending on what
kind of fiduciary you are?
MR. FREDERICK: The basic concept,
Justice Kennedy, is the same. There are two components,
where there must be full disclosure of information and a
fair result, and that fair result translates in
different contexts in different ways. Here, because of
the statutory references to fiduciary duty with respect
to compensation, one focuses on the fairness of the fee
charged.
But, as Professor Dumont points out in her
amicus brief, the idea of a fiduciary duty is one that
is well known in various circumstances of the law, and
as applied here the concept goes to the fairness of the
fee.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would the test for
compensation in this case be the same as any director or
any officer of a corporation?
MR. FREDERICK: The difference here, Justice
Kennedy, is that in those circumstances the indicia of
an arm's-length transaction may be achieved. The
directors can fire the head of a company. They can call
for changes.
Here, the investment adviser has appointed
the members of the board. As this Court said in the
Daily Income Fund case, the earmarks of an -- of an
arm's-length transaction are absent precisely because --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to know, is
the fiduciary duties the same? Is the fiduciary
standard the same, without getting into how its applied?
Is the fiduciary standard the same for
Jones, for a guardian, for a trustee, for a corporate
officer or a corporate director, always the same?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes. The concept is fair
result through full information and good-faith
negotiations.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And for lawyers?
MR. FREDERICK: For lawyers --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Lawyers have a fiduciary
obligation to their clients; right?
MR. FREDERICK: That is true.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So courts should review
lawyers' fees for -- on the basis of whether it's a fair
result.
MR. FREDERICK: That is how courts do it
every day in this country, Justice Scalia, when they are
asked to make fee applications for reasonableness.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but this is
different. I mean, this is part of an expense of a
fund. They don't get fees, but -- but they get -- they
have to pay for the lawyers, just like they have to pay
for management advice.
So why wouldn't you review the lawyers' fees
to make sure they are fair?
MR. FREDERICK: The lawyers' fees in which
context, Mr. Chief Justice? I'm not sure I understand
the question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel for the
fund.
MR. FREDERICK: Counsel for the fund is --
that is actually not at issue here, but the issue of
what constitutes reasonable expenses may arise in
various circumstances.
The statute prohibits fees that are
unreasonable in terms of their unfairness to the fund.
The concept here is that the board cannot fire the
investment adviser. So in evaluating the fairness of
the fee the adviser is charging the fund, the normal
indicia of an arm's-length transaction is absent, and
that is the key principle here because this adviser is
using the same manager to provide the same research
analytics from the same research group, from the same
meetings, buying the same stocks, and simply allocating
them to different accounts and charging those to whom it
owes a fiduciary duty twice what it is getting at
arm's-length.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was in this
record, was there not, a submission by the adviser
comparing what mutual funds this fund was charged, what
institutional funds were charged, but explaining the
differential in terms of the services provided, that
more services were provided to the fund and less
services were provided to the institutional investors.
MR. FREDERICK: And, Justice Ginsburg, that
is where there is a disputed issue of fact for which
summary judgment is not appropriate, because the
plaintiffs submitted evidence that in fact the services
provided to the institutional investors were greater,
even though they were being charged a lower amount of
money.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who would have the
burden? You said that is an issue that has not been
decided, it's a disputed issue of fact, appropriate for
remand. Who -- would you have the burden if they came
forward and said, look, this is what our situation is.
These are the services. Would you have the burden to
show that in fact they were comparable and the
differences did not warrant the differences in the fee?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would have the
burden?
MR. FREDERICK: We have the burden.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's different from
normal trust law, isn't it?
MR. FREDERICK: It is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Normally where you are a
fiduciary, it's up to you to prove that it was
reasonable.
MR. FREDERICK: That's true.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So Congress evidently did
not mean ordinary trust law to apply in this context.
MR. FREDERICK: We disagree with that last
part, Justice Scalia. We agree that Congress did make
modifications to the way a cause of action ordinarily
would have been brought at common law for breach of
fiduciary duty in several respects, including imposing
the burden of proof on the investor. Where we disagree
is that when they used the phrase "fiduciary duty" they
intended to mean something less than what fiduciary duty
had meant at common law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- if you
are having courts decide -- review what is fair, a fair
fee, what if the adviser had given such good advice that
the fund beat the industry average for his category of
fund by 5 percent over the last 5 years. Does he get
double the normal compensation of the average fees?
Does he get triple? 50 percent more? How is the court
supposed to decide that?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, there is an issue of
fact as to how relevant performance is. They didn't
give the money back when their performance lagged behind
the market, Mr. Chief Justice, in this case. So the
question of whether or not a performance metric is
relevant is certainly a factor that will be entitled to
less --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, surely you
think it is. When you say they don't give the money
back, you are not suggesting that the amount of the fees
should be the same regardless of whether they outperform
by 10 percent or not?
MR. FREDERICK: My point, Mr. Chief Justice,
is that when they charge the same amount, buying the
same stocks, to institutional investors and achieve the
same performance, there is no reason why the mutual fund
should be charged twice as much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there is
different parameters, right, in the sense that you're
trying -- the company is trying to attract investors to
the mutual fund. If you are advising a pension fund, it
is not the case that they are trying to attract
pensioners who have other choices.
MR. FREDERICK: But the investor doesn't
gain because of the marketing skill of the adviser.
Simply having a larger asset pool which increases the
fee that the adviser can charge doesn't inure to the
individual benefit of the investor. And the point of
this statute was to provide protection against investors
so that when the adviser charged excessive fees that
excess would be returned to the fund for the pro
rata benefit --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You said that Congress
used "fiduciary" in a special sense. Then -- then, I
have to conclude that your earlier answer is confusing
for me, because I thought you were going to tell us that
this investment adviser has the same fiduciary standard
that officers and directors of corporations have. Then
you say that Congress used it in this special sense. So
that doesn't quite square.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Kennedy, let
me just add the extra words of the statute, because what
Congress said was a fiduciary duty "with respect to
compensation." And so when I say special sense, I mean
that Congress used additional words to elaborate on the
circumstance in which the fiduciary duty would be
examined.
Here what is happening is that an
arm's-length transaction for the same services -- the
same manager is going out and touting his services to
the institutional investor, but simply charging them
half as much money for providing the same portfolio of
management.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do technological
changes make a difference in terms of disclosures
required? These days all you have to do is push a
button and you find out exactly what the management fees
are. I mean, you just look it up on Morningstar and
it's right there and you can make -- as an investor you
can make whatever determination you'd like, including to
take your money out.
MR. FREDERICK: The fact that an investor
may know going in what the fee is does not address the
problem Congress was intending to address, which is that
as larger and larger sums of assets were accreted to the
mutual fund, the investor was not obtaining the benefits
of economies of scale. And that's the central point --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we could look
at -- you know, as the fund grows bigger and he doesn't
get those benefits he can go look at another fund. It
takes 30 seconds.
MR. FREDERICK: And that again doesn't
address the problem Congress was trying to get at, which
is to protect the company, not the individual investor.
The individual investor might lessen the damages that
that investor suffers, but the fund, the people
remaining, continue to pay excessive fees.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but he protects the
company ultimately, because when investors leave the
company that is charging excessive fees to go to other
companies, the company that they are leaving sees that
something's wrong and has to lower its compensation to
its adviser. Why doesn't that affect the company at
issue?
MR. FREDERICK: A large number of assets
under management in mutual funds, something like 26 to
percent according to materials that are in the
record, are from 401(k) plans, where the investor is
essentially locked into the fund that his or her company
chooses to make that investment. And even as to
investors who are not locked in, there are significant
tax consequences where over time an investor might be in
the Oakmark Fund and have to suffer large tax
consequences in order to get the benefit of the
statute --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Companies --
companies change who they invest with under the 401(k)'s
all the time. The employees are not happy with the
return they are getting because the company has limited
their choices, they change. It happens all the time.
MR. FREDERICK: And Mr. Chief Justice, as
the Court recognized in the Daily Income Fund case, this
is a unique cause of action in which Congress was
intending to protect the entire corpus of the investors
in the fund, because --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You told me just a
little while ago, or told somebody, Congress wasn't
interested in protecting investors; they were interested
in protecting the companies.
MR. FREDERICK: The company is comprised of
the investors, Mr. Chief Justice. What the right of
action does not do is to provide individual damages to
the investor who brings the suit. The recovery inures
to the entire benefit of all the investors.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I unpackage
your argument a little bit. Because using the word
"fair fee" in my mind is meaningless, because it has to
be fair in relationship to something. And so what is
your definition of what that something is that it's fair
to, and -- or unfair against? And start from there,
because I understood the Seventh Circuit to be saying:
Look, a fair fee is paying market value. If one takes a
sort of reading -- whatever negotiation goes on between
the two, as long as there has been full disclosure as
required, that's the market. So that's fair. You're
saying it's something else. What's that something else?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, what the Court said in
pepper is that fair is what is reflective of what an
arm's-length agreement would produce.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So you start
there.
MR. FREDERICK: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So let's
stop confusing this -- the articulation of the standard,
which is -- that's fair. What would an arm's-length
transaction produce? And let's go to what seems to be
part of your argument and sort of what everyone's
skirting around, which is what's the proof that a
particular transaction is not arm's-length?
The Seventh Circuit appeared to be saying,
it's arm's-length when the parties have done all of the
disclosure that is required, because then the buyer can
decide whether they want to pay that fee or not, and
once they choose to it's a fair price. It's an arm's-
length transaction. You are saying not, and that's
what -- that's where I am trying to get to the nub of
why not? Why is --
MR. FREDERICK: Because the directors can't
fire and walk away from the advisor. In any arm's-
length transaction, if I sell you a car and you don't
like the price can you walk away.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- now, that's
begging the question, because Congress hasn't said a
reasonable fee. It did say fiduciary duty, but it
didn't -- there is a subtle but very important
difference between reasonable and -- a reasonable fee
and a fiduciary duty with respect to fees.
MR. FREDERICK: True. There are two
components: Was there full information and good faith
negotiating; and was the result fair. In Pepper, the
Court said if the result is not fair there can be a
breach of fiduciary duty.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm still begging the
question, fair against what.
MR. FREDERICK: Fair against what the
adviser actually charged for same or similar services to
an outsider who had the right to walk away.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, I don't
understand your statement that they can't fire the
investment adviser. Maybe they can't fire him, but they
can insist that he accept a lower fee, right? Surely
they can do that, can't they?
MR. FREDERICK: They --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can they insist that he
accept a lower fee? Can they do that.
MR. FREDERICK: In practical terms, no.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?
MR. FREDERICK: Because the adviser picks
the board of directors.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, no, that's something
different. Let's assume you have a disinterested board
of directors, which is what the statute requires. You
tell me even though they are disinterested, they can't
fire the adviser. It seems to me, while they can't fire
him, they can say: We are going to cut your fee in
half. Whereupon they don't have to fire him. He will
pack up and leave, and they will get a new adviser.
Doesn't that work?
MR. FREDERICK: There is actually no
evidence in any record I am aware of where that has
actually happened. The directors have no leverage. And
that's the problem the Court -- this Court recognized in
the Daily Income Fund case.
If I could reserve the balance of my time,
please.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Gannon.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The fiduciary duty imposed by section 36(b)
prohibits an investment adviser's fee from being outside
the range that arm's-length bargaining would produce.
The courts below erred by failing to consider evidence
about what the investment adviser in this case charges
its unaffiliated clients when it provides services that
Petitioners claim are, in fact, comparable to the
services at issue here.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think Congress used
the term "fiduciary" in a very special sense here? I
will just tell you the problem I'm having with the case.
If I look at a standard that the fees must be reasonable
and I compare that with what a fiduciary would do, I
thought a fiduciary has the highest possible duty. But
apparently the submission is the fiduciary has a lower
duty, a lesser duty than to charge a reasonable fee. I
just find that quite a puzzling use of the word
"fiduciary."
Now, if Congress uses it as a term of art or
in some special sense, fine.
MR. GANNON: Well, we do think that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me an odd
use of the term "fiduciary." I don't know why Congress
didn't use some other word.
MR. GANNON: Well, we do think that the term
"fiduciary duty" is here used to counterbalance the lack
of arm's-length bargaining that exists between the board
of directors and the investment adviser, and we do think
that it drew upon the established term of art in
Pepper v. Litton, the case that counsel for Petitioners
was already referring to. That's a case that actually
involved corporate directors and there the same test,
the same ultimate standard, was stated, which is whether
the bargain carries the earmarks of an arm's length
bargain and whether it's inherently fair.
And so we do think that in the development
of the legislation in 1969, the memorandum that the SEC
submitted to Congress in 1969 explained that the shift
from reasonableness to fiduciary duty largely achieved
some procedural objectives of shifting the focus from
the board of directors to the investment adviser, and
the text of the statute specifically makes it a
fiduciary duty with respect to receipt of compensation.
We think one salutary affect of that was to
-- to make it clear that the Court's burden here, the
Court's duty here, wasn't just to establish what the
single most reasonable fee would be, but harking back to
the Pepper v. Litton test, whether the bargain fell
within the range of what arm's length bargaining
otherwise would have achieved.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if we are
going to have regulation of what fees can be charged,
you cite in your brief the various regulations the SEC
has issued. It makes a lot more sense to have the SEC
regulate rates than to have courts do it, doesn't it?
MR. GANNON: Well, in the abstract, it might
make more sense, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the choice
that Congress made here was to counterbalance the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are not
suggesting the SEC wouldn't have authority to do that,
are you?
MR. GANNON: Well, even under this statute,
the SEC has the authority to file suits under section
(b).
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Has it filed any?
MR. GANNON: It hasn't filed any since --
since 1980, Justice Ginsburg. I think that the SEC in
this context -- it has -- it has primarily directed its
resources and energies into encouraging there to be
better disclosure of fees, both the disclosure of
information to the board, disclosure to investors,
better education to shareholders so that they would be
able to go --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it must be aware of
the -- of the divergence between the fees that
investment advisers charge to these companies and what
they charge to other clients. Isn't the SEC aware of
that?
MR. GANNON: It is aware of that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And yet has brought no
suits against this industry?
MR. GANNON: Since 1980 it hasn't used
section 36(b). It has used less formal mechanisms in
the context of examinations and investigators -- -
JUSTICE SCALIA: For disclosure, just for
disclosure. But that suggests to me that the SEC may
think that this is indeed a self-contained industry and
that the comparison with investment advice given to
other entities is -- is not a fair one.
MR. GANNON: Well, when the SEC helped draft
the statute in the 1960s, it recognized that there was
this systematic disparity between the amounts that
mutual funds were being charged by investment advisers
and the amounts that investment advisers were charging
their unaffiliated clients, and in the 1969 memorandum
that I referred to, which is reprinted in an appendix to
the amicus brief by John Bogel in its entirety, the SEC
mentioned that comparison as being something that may
well be relevant in proving in an individual case that
that particular investment adviser's fees are excessive.
And we think that the test here of whether
under all the circumstances, which is what section
(b)(2) points the Court towards, of having to weigh --
having to weigh the board's approval of fees in light of
all the circumstances, that those circumstances include
things like the evidence that petitioners have presented
here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gannon, the -- all
the circumstances, that comes from the Second Circuit's
Gartenberg case?
MR. GANNON: Well, it also comes,
Justice Ginsburg, from the text of section 36(b)(2).
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in -- in that case,
at least there was a footnote that seemed to say, you
don't have to engage in a -- in the comparison with what
institutional investors are paid.
MR. GANNON: The footnote that you are
talking about did point out that in that case the
comparison that the plaintiffs were attempting to draw
between the money market fund at issue and a pension
fund wasn't a particularly relevant one, because the
services at issue were so different. And here the
parties appear to dispute how different the services
are. And at the summary judgment stage, the Respondent
stated that it disputed how comparable the relevant
services were.
The district court and the court of appeals
considered that dispute immaterial because, instead of
comparing, instead of determining whether this
investment adviser is selling the same services at half
the price to its unaffiliated clients who actually can
engage in arm's length bargaining, those courts simply
said that if it -- if it falls within the range that is
charged by other mutual funds, that would be acceptable.
And we --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the statute
does not say, in considering the rates you look at all
the circumstances. Am I right? It says, in considering
whether to defer to the board, you look at all the
circumstances.
MR. GANNON: It does say that you should
give the board --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The board.
MR. GANNON: -- such consideration as is
deemed appropriate under all the circumstances. That's
correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But isn't
that different than saying, in looking at what the rates
should be or whether they are excessive, you look at all
the circumstances? It may well be that you don't defer
to the board, but that doesn't mean it's a free-for-all
in deciding what you do look at.
MR. GANNON: Well, I think that it
demonstrates that the Court is obligated to look to all
the circumstances simply to determine whether the
board's approval -- how much weight it should be given.
And as this Court explained in Daily Income
Fund, the entire point of section 36(b) is to provide an
independent check, the -- independent of the fact that
the directors approved the fees. We think that an
appropriately informed board that asks the right
questions, that gets the right information and fully
considers the sort of factors that are discussed --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even if they agree to
pay double the price?
MR. GANNON: We think that -- that the right
process followed by the board would be probative, but
something like double the price may -- may demonstrate
that that is an unfair bargain.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- that's what --
are you advocating that there is a stand-alone cause of
action or breach of duty when there isn't full
disclosure, even if the fee is within arm's length --
normal -- begging the question of what's normal, but
assuming that it's within an arm's-length transaction
range in the market?
MR. GANNON: If there was a lack of full
disclosure, that might in the abstract be a breach of
fiduciary duty even under the Seventh Circuit's test.
We think that if it didn't actually have an effect on
the fees, then it wouldn't be actionable here because
there would be no actual damages flowing from the lack
of disclosure.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But even if there is full
disclosure, your position is in every case a court must
decide whether the fee is reasonable or not.
MR. GANNON: A court would need to decide
whether the plaintiff has met its burden of proving that
it falls outside the range of fees that arm's-length
bargaining would have arrived at, and that's a cause of
action that would be --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how much deviance,
and what is the scope of the range?
MR. GANNON: Well, I think that the term of
art of "fiduciary duty" doesn't necessarily demonstrate
how much deviance away from the range there would be. I
think that depending upon the segment of the market the
range might be more or less narrow.
In segments of the market where services are
more commodified and standardized, perhaps with index
funds, there might be a much narrower range of fees that
are arrived at through arm's-length bargaining, and even
-- and smaller disparities might be inappropriate there.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: How is the -- how is the
standard you've just described different from a standard
of reasonableness?
MR. GANNON: It -- I think that the chief
way it differs from reasonableness, Justice Kennedy, is
in saying that the Court doesn't actually have to decide
what the single most reasonable fee is. But as the SEC
explained in 1969, the shift from reasonableness to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I would be very
surprised if "reasonableness" always meant one -- one
figure. It could mean a range.
MR. GANNON: Well, I think reasonableness
is - is inevitably going to be part of the inherent
fairness inquiry that this Court referred to in Pepper
v. Litton as being part of the fiduciary duty status as
to whether the transaction --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question
going back to Justice Kennedy's early question? Do you
think the fiduciary status of the defendant in this case
is different from the fiduciary status of a president of
a corporation?
MR. GANNON: I -- I -- I think that it is
different from the status of a president of a
corporation; that -- that the term of art, "fiduciary"
which Congress was invoking here can mean different
things in different circumstances.
Pepper was a case that involved corporate
directors. The chief difference here and what Congress
was intending to counteract was the inherent structural
impediment to arm's-length bargaining between the
investment adviser and the board of directors. And
that's what makes that high burden that was used in
Pepper v. Litton for controlling shareholders the
relevant analogy, we believe.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. GANNON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Donovan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. DONOVAN, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DONOVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The point that Mr. Gannon just made and that
Mr. Frederick made before, that there was some
structural impediment to negotiations between a mutual
fund board and adviser, is at the heart of this dispute,
because that is a judgment that Congress made. The
Investment Company Act in the first instance delegates
responsibility to the board of directors to approve
fees. A fee may not be approved that does not have the
consent of a majority of the independent trustees in the
first instance.
The independent check on fees that is
erected by section 36(b) --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume -- let's
assume that all of the independent board of director
members vote for a particular fee, but the fee is
negotiated by an insider, and the insider is the one who
does the evaluation, looks at them and says: I think
this is really a great deal, guys. And they just fell
for it. Is that a process that would guarantee an
arm's-length transaction in the sense that Congress
intended in this act?
MR. DONOVAN: It may not and it may give
rise to a cause of action. But as I started --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which cause of action --
MR. DONOVAN: A cause of action --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- under what?
MR. DONOVAN: It may give a cause of action
under section 36(b) if the circumstances you described,
Justice Sotomayor are -- have an impact upon the fee.
And the reason --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, then their process
is part of your definition of "fiduciary duty"? A court
has to look at the nature of process?
MR. DONOVAN: If there is an impact upon fee
that is outside of the range of what could have been
bargained. The reason for that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now -- now you are
adding what has been added, which is outside of the
range, correct?
MR. DONOVAN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.
MR. DONOVAN: If I understand your question
correctly, will a process flaw alone justify a
section 36(b) cause of action? My answer is no. Will a
process flaw that affects a fee justify a 36(b) action?
Yes, it will.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But what you
are -- but what you are arguing is, if the process is
fair, even if the fee is outside the range of an arm's-
length transaction, there is no cause of action?
MR. DONOVAN: No, I -- I -- I doubt that as
well. There are two separate causes of action, I can
imagine, under 36(b): One, a process flaw that has a
fee impact; and second, a fee that is so far outside of
the bounds of what could have been bargained that it
justifies independent review.
The question under 36(b) is whether, having
delegated responsibility in the first instance to a
board, there is a reason to second-guess their judgment.
And the independent check that Mr. Gannon referred to at
section 36(b) or (a) should not be a de novo judicial
review of the size of the fee for a couple of reasons,
the first of which is section 36(b)(2). That statute
instructs courts to give such consideration as they
consider due to the deliberations of the board. What
did they see? What did they get? Did they negotiate?
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a wonderfully clear
command, isn't it? Such consideration as is
appropriate? What is the language? Read it. What is
MR. DONOVAN: The language is "such
consideration that the court considers due under the
circumstances."
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow.
(Laughter.)
MR. DONOVAN: But there would be no reason
for that instruction at all, Your Honor, if a court were
to make its own judgments about what is fair and
reasonable.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it's meaningless. It
tells the court to make its own judgment. Such
consideration as the court deems due. Give it
whatever -- whatever consideration you -- you feel like.
It's utterly meaningless to me.
MR. DONOVAN: What I think Congress was
doing was considering what the source of the common law
had been before. The corporate context,
Justice Kennedy, I think was what inspired. At
corporate law, a decision would not be second-guessed by
a court unless there was a reason to do so, unless the
judgment of directors and the presumption of regularity
that attached to their decisions could for some reason
be second-guessed. Was there a process flaw? Was it so
far out of bounds?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what is "so
far out of bounds"? In other words, you are saying, you
can look at what the directors did if it's, as you said,
too far out of bounds, but 10 percent off, 50 percent
off?
MR. DONOVAN: Mr. Chief --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Double, as they say
is the case here?
MR. DONOVAN: I'm sorry?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Double, as they say
is the case here?
MR. DONOVAN: As the plaintiffs say is the
case here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.
MR. DONOVAN: I suggest there is no
numerical basis, because in fact every kind of mutual
fund and ever stripe of mutual fund is different.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then you say:
Look to see if it's outside the bounds, and now you tell
me there is no way to look to see if it's outside the
bounds.
MR. DONOVAN: Well, I think -- the first
comparative would be other funds of a similar stripe.
So, for example, you could imagine that a mutual fund
with the same investment objective and style that is two
times might be inappropriate. You could also imagine a
different circumstance where, passively managed funds
for example, a multiple of fees would be inappropriate.
You could also, though, imagine a case where
there is substantial risk taken, where the types of
securities that are invested in are unusual, where
substantial differences could be justified.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the test that the
court of appeals here applied?
MR. DONOVAN: Pardon?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the test that the
court of appeals here applied, whose judgment you want
us to affirm?
MR. DONOVAN: The court of appeals did not
apply the test. Judge Easterbrook --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So we should remand it for
application of the test that you propose?
MR. DONOVAN: I don't think you have to.
And the reason is because of what the district court
did. And there I get to, Justice Ginsburg, what you
said. The -- the argument is made that services are the
same. In fact, that is not the record. And if you look
at page 161 of the Joint Appendix and following, there
is a list of services that the trust -- the investment
adviser gave to the trustees in this case, about all of
the services that they did for their fee in the case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely that's a disputed
fact, isn't it? And you want us to dispose -- or you
want this to be disposed of on summary judgment. The
other side says the services aren't that much different.
MR. DONOVAN: They are very different. Page
1 and following will tell you how. And the district
court at page 360 -- 16a, excuse me, of the district
court's opinion, notices that the services were
different. So, under --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't talking about
this particular case. It was talking about in general,
wasn't --
MR. DONOVAN: No, he was talking about this
case, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that they claim
that you were receiving additional payment for the
services, or some or at least a substantial number of
the services, that you claim are attributed by the
difference. So they're saying if you compare apples to
apples, you are charging twice the amount. If you
compare apples to oranges, there are differences because
the oranges were different, but you were getting paid
for those oranges separately. I think that was their
argument.
MR. DONOVAN: That is their argument and
it's not accurate, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the issue
of disputed fact. So let's go back. Are you disavowing
the Seventh Circuit's approach? Because I read your
brief and it doesn't appear as if you are defending
their market approach that says so long as the process
was fair, any fee is okay. That's how I thought they
had reached their conclusion.
MR. DONOVAN: I think what Judge Easterbrook
said, and we don't agree, is if there is deceit of
directors that would justify a cause of action under
(b). But in the absence of, in his words, "pulling
the wool over the eyes of the trustees" --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I'm talking
-- I am using his words in terms of case --
MR. DONOVAN: I do --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you're disavowing
that?
MR. DONOVAN: I do not defend that, because
I can imagine, as your hypothetical asked earlier,
directors or trustees who -- are not paying attention --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your positions is no
different than the solicitor general's, that there has
to be some measure of fair process and some measure of a
fair fee, at least within -- in terms of it not being
outside the range an arm's length transaction?
MR. DONOVAN: The solicitor general gets it
right when she describes Gartenberg as the standard. Is
this a result that could have been fairly bargained at
arm's length. Where we part company is with respect to
two things: One is, she says and Mr. Gannon said today,
that the most important consideration is a comparison to
other kinds of fees, and that is required in the
calculus in the district court. In fact, that would
make mandatory what the SEC rules only make
discretionary.
Chief Justice, you asked earlier about the
SEC's rules in this area. And in fact, they compel
disclosure of fees charged by advisers to their funds
and their conflicts of similar investment objectives.
They do not require disclosure of accounts within an
advisor's business operations that are institutional
accounts. Now to be sure --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That are what?
MR. DONOVAN: That are -- advisers --
institutional accounts adviser services. If --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the fund
adviser here -- I mean, the investment adviser did
disclose -- that's in the record -- did disclose the
difference between what were charged mutual funds, what
were charged institutional investors, and then explained
that the services were different and that justified the
difference. But they weren't trying to think, no, we
don't have to come forward with this information.
MR. DONOVAN: That's precisely correct, Your
Honor. In this case the trustees did have the
information. The adviser did disclose it, but the SEC
does not require them to ask that question. All it
requires them to do is if they do ask the question, if
they do study the material, they must disclose the
weight they put on to it.
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you were appointed
to a committee, just set my pay, that might be helpful.
I'd say I'll pay you $50,000 a year to do it, as long as
I am satisfied with your results.
Now, would you, for example, not have in
your mind, I would like to know what he's paid by other
people that don't have someone like me setting his pay?
Wouldn't that be in your mind?
MR. DONOVAN: It could be, sure.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, so wouldn't that be a
normal question to ask?
MR. DONOVAN: And the trustees did ask it
here.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't know if they
asked it -- I mean, I think we are reviewing the
district court opinion, I think we are reversing -- we
are reviewing -- sorry. We're reviewing.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: I have laryngitis; I don't
speak accurately.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: I think we are reviewing a
-- a decision of a court of appeals setting a standard,
and so wouldn't, when we set the standard, say, we can't
say if in every case you are not going to go out and ask
him what he charges when he mows the neighbor's lawn,
but we would like to know what he charges when he asks
for money from people who do not have this kind of
supervision, and we would like if it's a lot different
to ask him why.
MR. DONOVAN: Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so what's the problem
then with saying that in the opinion?
MR. DONOVAN: There is no problem with
saying that if it is a relevant consideration.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's pretty unusual
that it won't be, and I think certainly you have in the
case in front of us a case where it would be relevant.
You may have an answer to the question. There may be a
perfectly good answer, so let's listen to it.
MR. DONOVAN: The difference, Your Honor, is
that the Solicitor General and the plaintiffs would make
the question and the answer dispositive in every case.
I would acknowledge as --
JUSTICE BREYER: The answer dispositive?
Well, I don't see it should be dispositive, maybe the
answers would be quite different.
MR. DONOVAN: Precisely.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- but you
no objection, then I'm not sure there is much of an
issue. There might -- I mean, maybe there is some.
That's the only issue, whether this should be
dispositive always, or whether it should be a factor to
take into account where relevant?
MR. DONOVAN: It is a factor that I consider
that is likely to be relevant --
JUSTICE BREYER: So you have no objection to
send it back and say look, of course this is relevant,
perhaps quite often relevant; why don't you look at it?
MR. DONOVAN: My objection -- my objection
to sending it back is only that that analysis was done.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But did -- but in the
Seventh Circuit, Judge Easterbrook said, mainly you have
to look to see if there was full disclosure, and then
there might be cases where it's so out of line. And he
said the comparison would be to other mutual funds. He
excluded the comparison with institutional investors.
So to that extent, was the Second Circuit wrong, saying
this is not a relevant factor; what other mutual funds
pay investment advisors may be a relevant factor?
MR. DONOVAN: I think the Seventh Circuit
made that comparison. Judge Easterbrook did say that
the services of institutional accounts ordinarily are
different from mutual fund accounts. I agree that in
the first instance, the first comparator usually should
be mutual funds, and regrettably Judge Easterbrook did
not cite to the record for the reasons to identify those
differences. But it is in fact in the record, and there
is no other record that suggests that they were the
same. All we had below was the assertion that on the
one hand, an advisory contract for an institutional
account said advisory services. And in the other we had
a mutual fund advisory contract that said advisory
services.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say you
should look at the range and how far it's off, do you
mean that in the Gartenberg sense -- in other words, if
it is way out of line, then you assume or can at least
look further at whether there was a fair process? Or do
you mean it in the normal case, in sort of setting the
rates you just look how far it is off.
MR. DONOVAN: I look at it in the Gartenberg
sense, Your Honor. And the reason is because as I --
from what I said the first question is, is when do you
ask courts to substitute their judgment?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's probably --
you're not the person to -- to ask, but do you
understand the Solicitor General's position to be your
understanding of the Gartenberg sense or something else?
MR. DONOVAN: I believe they interpret in
the Gartenberg sense. I think that the Solicitor
General's position and the Respondent's, with respect to
the standard that you ought to apply, is Gartenberg.
JUSTICE BREYER: What do we do about
Gartenberg? That is to say, the key sentence you can
read either way. The key sentence could mean -- it just
depends on tone of voice. You must charge a fee that is
not so disproportionately large that it bears no
reasonable relationship to the services rendered and
could not -- could not have been the product of
arms-length bargaining. Or you could say, look, it's
unlawful where it's so large -- it doesn't -- where
there is no reasonable relationship. And if there is no
reasonable relationship, how could it have been the
product of arm's-length bargaining?
MR. DONOVAN: I agree you can turn the words
upside down. I think they turned it upside down --
JUSTICE BREYER: You object if we turn them
upside down?
MR. DONOVAN: I think they turned them
upside down for a reason, and the reason is 36(b)(1),
which imposes the burden of proof upon --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm saying the tone,
be a little careful here.
MR. DONOVAN: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: So we can say the substance
is -- I'm just trying this out -- the substance is to
look and see if it's reasonable, and if it's reasonable
it certainly is the product of arm-length bargaining, if
it's not reasonable, how could it be? Got to get an
answer to that, okay? So, that way you see the tone is
be careful, you are a judge, you are not a rate-setter.
How's that?
MR. DONOVAN: I would accept the proposition
that it is reasonable if it is outside of what could
have been bargained at arm's length. I think they
turned it upside down the fact for the reason that the
statute reverses the burden of proof and I think that
they also acknowledge that it is a process-oriented
thing for judges to do, because after all you are asking
here a standard for judges to apply in a contested
situation that recognizes the responsibility of the
board in the first instance. That's what 36(b)(2) is
all about.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would you give us
the citations of the parts of the record that you say
render it unnecessary for us to remand for the lower
court to consider a comparison with non- -- with
institutional charges?
MR. DONOVAN: Yes, Your Honor. I start at
page 16a and 17a of the district court's opinion where
at page 16a at the bottom the district court said the
services supplied are different. And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: At 16a of the Joint
Appendix you are talking about?
MR. DONOVAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor, the
petition.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of the petition.
MR. DONOVAN: Correct, it's 16a of the
petition, which is Judge Kocoras' opinion. At the
bottom of the page you will see that he said, the
services Harris provided to institutional clients varied
but in all events were more limited than those provided
the funds.
If you then go on to page 17, he goes
through with respect to each of these three funds and
chronicles the fees they paid and by comparison the fees
charged to institutional accounts with similar
investment objectives. The statement by the plaintiff,
Petitioners here, that the fee charged was a 2X
multiple, does not refer to that array of institutional
accounts. It takes one in order to make the comparison
what it is.
And then, Justice Scalia, I would then go to
page 32a of the district court's opinion where he
describes what appear to be disputed issues of fact.
And what he said those dispute issues of fact were about
were what the Petitioners claimed were flaws in the
negotiation process, in substance, what they would have
done had they been negotiating, rather than the
trustees. It is not a dispute about the ultimate test,
was this fee so far out of bounds it could not have been
reasonable.
To be sure, throughout a record that is as
large as this one, you could imagine the parties
disputed lots of things. What you could not fairly
dispute is whether these fees, for these funds, using
comparable funds and using institutional accounts, as
Judge Kocoras did, were so far out of bounds, they could
not have been fairly bargained, and if that is the test,
there is no need for remand.
If, as I suggest and as the Solicitor
General suggests, Gartenberg is the appropriate
standard, Gartenberg is what the district court applied.
This Court has to be sure, on occasion, and
it is rare, both announce the test and apply it in the
same circumstances.
In circumstances where courts are looking
for guidance on what the standard is and how to apply
it, I suggest this is a case in which affirming what the
district court did would be appropriate.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the
petitioners' allegation that the investment adviser did
not provide full and accurate information? And they
mention particularly concerning economies of scale,
profitability, and several other matters, that what
everybody agrees is necessary, full disclosure, had not
occurred.
Is that a disputed issue of fact or of
further inquiry?
MR. DONOVAN: I don't think it is, Your
Honor. And, again, I would go back to what Judge
Kocoras said on 32(a).
There was absolutely suggestions in the
record by the plaintiff that they would have negotiated
differently, but, for example, with respect to
ostensible misrepresentations on -- among other things,
profitability and the rest, this was because the
plaintiffs' expert did an accounting and accounted for
costs differently and said, had you accounted for costs
and allocated them the way I did, you would have reached
a negotiated result that was different.
Well, that just isn't what happened. That's
why Judge Kocoras said, this goes to the integrity of
the negotiation. Would the negotiation have been
different?
The plaintiffs say, I would have done it
differently, but that's all they said, and it's not a
misrepresentation to say, I would have accounted for
costs differently.
Finally, I would -- the other question you
asked is where in the record -- Justice Scalia, I'm
sorry. It's at page 161 and following, where the
background of all the difference in fees and the
difference in services is chronicled.
You can tell, from the pull-out charts at
page 171, what fee is charged for each of these mutual
funds and what fee is charged for institutional
accounts.
If you take the plaintiffs' point of view
and say that a comparison to institutional accounts is
always required and may be dispositive and is always a
fraction of what mutual fund charges and that judges are
the, in the first instance, the ones to decide who is
fair and reasonable or what is fair and reasonable, as
opposed to directors, I suggest you consign 8,000 mutual
funds to a trial.
On this record, these were funds that had
best in class performance for fees that were at or below
industry averages.
That is not a record upon which a reasonable
person could conclude that the adviser has over-reached.
That is at the heart of fiduciary duty. I see my time
is about to expire.
Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Frederick, you have three minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK: At this recording here did
not make findings -- this was a summary judgment case,
and in fact, the Court didn't find that the disputes
were nonexistent.
In fact, on page 30a, the district court
said that the disputes were nonmaterial, and that's a
very important distinction because the joint appendix
that you have before you contains a lot of evidence in
which it is disputed whether or not these were similar
services.
The Harris manager on page 6 -- JA 650, the
portfolio holdings of the funds, are very similar. On
2, the Harris fund manager testimony that, when he
buys a stock, he buys it for all mutual funds and
independent accounts, with the same investment
objective.
On 505 to 506, the Harris research director
testimony that the managers of the mutual funds and
independent accounts share equally all work done by the
research department, and 513 to 514, that the Harris
fund manager says all of our analysts do research for
all of our clients.
There is disputed evidence here as to what
constitutes similarity, Justice Sotomayor, these are
comparing apples to apples because the record indicates
that there are separate contracts for the additional
fees that they charge to the mutual funds for the
additional services provided.
We're simply talking about comparisons of
money management, but --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was your friend
correct, that these funds have better than average
performance and lower than average fees?
MR. FREDERICK: In one small aspect of the
damages period, that is correct, and after that was
found, they had lower than average performance and
higher than average fees, Mr. Chief Justice. It's a
damages period that encompasses several years.
If I could go back to the point, though,
about the fiduciary duty, what Judge Cardozo, when he
was on the New York Court of Appeals, said, a fiduciary
represents the punctilio of honor, and that is
contrasted with the morals of the marketplace operating
at arm's-length.
It surely cannot be the case that, where you
are dealing with a fiduciary duty -- which is a higher
standard recognized in the law -- that you can charge
twice as much as what you are obtaining at arm's-length
for services that you are providing.
The Gartenberg court, Justice Breyer, in
fact, had the opposite language that you are averting
to, and that is at page 694 F.2nd 928, where the Court
said, "The test is essentially whether the fee schedule
represents a charge within the range of what would have
been negotiated at arm's-length in the light of all the
surrounding circumstances."
JUSTICE BREYER: I thought, by reversing
that, picking out what the essence was, you would get
pretty close to what you are arguing for, without
getting into all this thing of whether it's just like a
trustee or whether a lawyer should be a trustee or --
you know, there are a lot of questions here that could
float around, of any language we use.
MR. FREDERICK: That's right. The Second
Circuit that went on to flip it and say, we had to prove
a negative, which is not ordinarily what a plaintiff has
to prove in any law case, by showing it -- it is so
disproportionate it could not have been achieved at
arm's-length, and that is where we think the court --
courts have gotten this wrong.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the case in the
