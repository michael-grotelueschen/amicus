CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
this morning in Case 14-114, King v. Burwell.
Mr. Carvin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. CARVIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This is a straightforward case of statutory
construction where the plain language of the statute
dictates the result.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Carvin, will you
please back up, because before we get to a question of
statutory construction, as you know, each plaintiff, or
at least one plaintiff, has to have a concrete stake in
these questions.  They can't put them as ideological
questions.
And we have as -- four plaintiffs.  As to
two of them, there is a declaration stating "I am not
eligible for health insurance from the government," but
there's a question of whether they are veterans eligible
for coverage as veterans.
MR. CARVIN:  Yes.  One of those is Mr. Hurst
who would have to, if -- I would refer you to Joint
Appendix at PAGE 42, where this is the government's
recitation of facts where they make it clear that
Mr. Hurst would have to spend $750 of his own money as
a -- because of the IRS rule.
Mr. Hurst was a veteran for 10 months in
1970.  He is not eligible for any veterans service
because if you've served such a short -- health
services.  If you serve such a short --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I -- I'll ask the
government if they agree that --
MR. CARVIN:  And I should point out that the
government has never disputed this, and I'd also like --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the Court has an
obligation to look into it on its own.
MR. CARVIN:  That's true, but of course
there has been fact-finding by lower courts in an
adversarial system.  I don't believe the Court does its
own --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't think it was ever
brought up in the lower court that these -- these two
people were veterans.
MR. CARVIN:  If I could just make one
further point on this, Justice Ginsburg.  Even if he
were technically eligible, which he is not, there is an
IRS Rule 26 C.F.R. 1.36B-2(c)(ii), which says --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ah, yes.
MR. CARVIN:  With the usual clarity of the
IRS code, making clear that you are only disabled from
receiving subsidies if you have actually enrolled in a
veteran's health services and it's undisputed that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Unless That's the government
that's --
MR. CARVIN:  -- Mr. Hurst did not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- that's their position too.
And then there were the two women, I think one of them
was going to turn 65 in June, which would make her
Medicaid-eligible.
MR. CARVIN:  She will turn 65 in late June.
She's obviously subject to the individual mandate well
in advance of that.  By virtue of the IRS rule, she
would have to spend $1800 per year for health insurance
by virtue of the IRS --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Per year?
MR. CARVIN:  Excuse me?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you said she will
turn 65 in June.
MR. CARVIN:  Late June, yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that takes care of
2015.
MR. CARVIN:  No.  Right now she is obliged
under the individual mandate to have insurance.  You --
you have to have insurance for 9 months of the year and
so as of April 1st --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then --
MR. CARVIN:  -- she will be subject to the
penalty which will be alleviated only by --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Again, I'll ask the
government if they agree with you on that.
And then I think for the fourth plaintiff,
there's a question whether she would qualify for a
hardship -- hardship exemption from the individual
mandate even if she received the tax credit, in which
case the tax credits would be irrelevant.
MR. CARVIN:  That's true.  Again, I'll refer
you to the Joint Appendix at 41.  That was the
government's argument below.  We didn't want to get into
a factual dispute about it because we had such clear
standing with respect --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yeah, but you have to --
MR. CARVIN:  -- to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you would have to
establish the standing, prove the standing.
MR. CARVIN:  Well, as --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If this gets beyond the
opening door.
MR. CARVIN:  Fair enough, Your Honor, but --
but it's black-letter law that only one plaintiff needs
standing, and for the reasons I've already articulated,
both Plaintiff Hurst and Plaintiff Levy have standing.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Okay.  I don't want to
detain you on this any more but I will ask the
government what their position is on standing.
MR. CARVIN:  Thank you.
Returning to the merits, the only provision
in the Act which either authorizes or limits subsidies
says, in plain English, that the subsidies are only
available through an exchange established by the State
under Section 1311.
JUSTICE BREYER:  If you're going to
elaborate on that, I would appreciate your -- in your
elaboration, I've read that, and this statute is like
the tax code more than it's like the Constitution.
There are defined terms, and the words you just used
concern a defined term.
As I read the definition, there's a section,
Definitions, and it says, quote, The term "Exchange"
means, quote, an exchange established under 1311.  And
1311 says, An Exchange shall be a government agency,
et cetera, that is established by a State.  Those are
the definitions.
So then you look to 1321.  And 1321 says, if
a State does not set up that Exchange, then the Federal,
quote, secretary shall establish and operate such
Exchange.
So it says, "The Secretary is to establish
and operate such Exchange," the only kind of Exchange to
which the Act refers, which is an -- quote, "an Exchange
established by a State under 1311."  That's the
definition.
So the statute tells the Secretary, set up
such Exchange, namely, a 1311 State Exchange.
MR. CARVIN:  Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And there's nothing else in
this statute.
MR. CARVIN:  Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So that's throughout what
they're talking about.  So what's the problem?
MR. CARVIN:  As Your Honor just said, it
tells the Secretary to establish such Exchange.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. CARVIN:  And what 36B turns on is
whether the State or the Secretary has established the
Exchange.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it uses the same
terminology that it's used in -- 15 times in this
statute, namely, the terminology in the definition is
"an Exchange established by a State."
MR. CARVIN:  Under --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the phrase.
MR. CARVIN:  Well, under 1311, that is the
phrase.  And if 1311 created some -- the definitional
section created some ambiguity as to whether HHS was
establishing a 1311 or 1321 Exchange, that is immaterial
because 36B does not say all 1311 Exchanges get
subsidies, it says Exchanges established by the State
under Section 1311 --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Carvin.
MR. CARVIN:  -- not established by HHS under
Section 1311 --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Carvin.
MR. CARVIN:  -- so it eliminates any
potential ambiguity created by the definitional section.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can -- can I offer you a
sort of simple daily life kind of example which I think
is linguistically equivalent to what the sections here
say that Justice Breyer was talking about?
So I have three clerks, Mr. Carvin.  Their
names are Will and Elizabeth and Amanda.  Okay?  So my
first clerk, I say, Will, I'd like you to write me a
memo.  And I say, Elizabeth, I want you to edit Will's
memo once he's done.  And then I say, Amanda, listen, if
Will is too busy to write the memo, I want you to write
such memo.
Now, my question is:  If Will is too busy to
write the memo and Amanda has to write such memo, should
Elizabeth edit the memo?
(Laughter.)
MR. CARVIN:  If you're going to create
moneys to Will for writing the memo and Amanda writes
the memo and you say, the money will go if Will writes
the memo, then under plain English and common sense, no,
when Amanda writes the memo --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Gosh --
MR. CARVIN:  -- but now --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- you -- you run a
different shop than I do if that's the way --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because in my chambers, if
Elizabeth did not edit the memo, Elizabeth would not be
performing her function.  In other words, there's a --
a substitute, and I've set up a substitute.  And then
I've given -- I've given instructions:  Elizabeth, you
write -- you edit Will's memo, but of course if Amanda
writes the memo, the instructions carry over.  Elizabeth
knows what she's supposed to do.  She's supposed to edit
Amanda's memo, too.
MR. CARVIN:  And -- and in your chambers,
you're agnostic as to whether Will, Elizabeth or Amanda
writes it.  But the key point is here under Section
1311, Congress was not agnostic as to whether States or
HHS established the Exchange.  It's --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. Carvin, if I had
those clerks, I had the same clerks --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- and Amanda wrote the
memo, and I received it and I said, This is a great
memo, who wrote it?  Would the answer be it was written
by Will, because Amanda stepped into Will's shoes?
MR. CARVIN:  That was my first answer.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN:  He's good, Justice Alito.
MR. CARVIN:  Justice Kagan didn't accept it,
so I'm going to the second answer, which is you are
agnostic as between Will and Amanda, but this --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ah, but that's --
MR. CARVIN:  But Congress was not agnostic
as between State and Federal Exchanges.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  That's a very
important point, I think, because what you're saying is
that the answer to the question really does depend on
context, and it depends on an understanding of the law
as a whole and whether they were agnostic.  I agree with
that.
So it's not the simple four or five words
because the four or five words in my example, it's
obvious that Elizabeth should edit the memo.  It's the
whole structure and context of the provision that
suggests whether those instructions carry over to the
substitute, isn't it?
MR. CARVIN:  We implore you to examine these
words in the context of the Act as a whole because our
argument becomes stronger for five reasons.
To respond to Justice Breyer's point, he
says such Exchange connotes that it's the same person
doing it.  But look at the provision on territorial
Exchanges.  It says, territories can establish such
Exchanges and then it says, "and shall be treated as a
State."  So -- so --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, it does.  But you say
connote.  No, it's not a question of connotation; it is
a question of denotation.  Now what does that mean?  It
means that the Federal government, the Secretary, is
establishing a thing for the State.  And what is the
thing?  The thing that it is establishing for the State
is defined as an Exchange established by the State.
MR. CARVIN:  To --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, that person from Mars,
who's literal, which I usually am not, but a literalist,
I think would have to read it that way.  But if you --
if you're not a literalist, well, at least you could
read it that way.
Now you want to go into the context -- if
you want to go into the context, at that point it seems
to me your argument really is weaker.
MR. CARVIN:  Well, two points.
JUSTICE BREYER:  The Exchanges fall apart,
nobody can buy anything on them.  You know the
arguments.  You've read the briefs.  Nobody can -- there
are no customers.  Employers don't have to pay penalties
as long as they use just people from Virginia, but one
Maryland person comes -- you know all those arguments.
So how does the context support you?
MR. CARVIN:  Well, again, under the
literalist or nonliteralist interpretation, saying that
HHS will establish such Exchange doesn't suggest that
the State has established such Exchange if there was --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the State, if made
the --
MR. CARVIN:  -- if there was ambiguity in
that regard -- just if I could finish my answer to
Justice Breyer -- you look at a parallel provision where
they use precisely the same language, and they said,
"and shall be treated as a State," that language which
is notably omitted from 1321 --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Correct -- correct – you’re right --.
MR. CARVIN:  -- and it's a basic principle
of statutory construction that you interpret the same
phrases the same way.  And it shows that Congress knew
how to create equivalence between non-State Exchanges
and Exchanges if and when it wanted to.
Sorry, Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Take a breath.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm -- I'm a little
concerned with how you envision this provision working.
You're saying that the HHS Exchange can't be for the
State so that it's established by the choice of the
State.
The choice the State had was establish your
own Exchange or let the Federal government establish it
for you.  That was the choice.  If we read it the way
you're saying, then we're going to read a statute as
intruding on the Federal-State relationship, because
then the States are going to be coerced into
establishing their own Exchanges.  And you say, oh, no,
they can't be coerced, but let's go back to what Justice
Breyer was talking about.
In those States that don't -- their citizens
don't receive subsidies, we're going to have the death
spiral that this system was created to avoid.  States
are obligated, insurers are obligated to make sure that
in their States, whether they're part of this program or
not, that they have guaranteed coverage, that 26 -- that
children are covered till they're 26, and that they base
their costs on community ratings.  So if they have to do
that, then costs are going to rise on every insurance --
every insurance plan offered in the country in those 34
States, 3 or 6 of -- or 9 of your States will have
tightened their Medicaid eligibility requirements in
contravention of the Act, so they're taking money by
breaking their compacts.  They would have to lose all of
their Medicaid money.
Tell me how that is not coercive in an
unconstitutional way?  And if it is coercive in an
unconstitutional way, in Bond just -- I think it was
last term, we said that that is a primary statutory
command; that we read a statute in a way where we don't
impinge on the basic Federal-State relationship.
MR. CARVIN:  This Court has never suggested
outside the very unusual coercion context of the NFIB
Medicaid that a funding condition somehow invades a
State police power.  Obviously --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, we did it -- we said
it last year.
MR. CARVIN:  In an NF -- no, no.  In Bond,
there the Federal government was taking away a police
power.  Here, all the Federal government is doing is
saying you want billions of free Federal dollars.
That's hardly invading State sovereignty and it's the
kind of routine  funding condition that this Court
has upheld countless times. As to the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me say that from the
standpoint of the dynamics of Federalism, it does seem
to me that there is something very powerful to the point
that if your argument is accepted, the States are being
told either create your own Exchange, or we'll send your
insurance market into a death spiral.  We'll have people
pay mandated taxes which will not get any credit
on -- on the subsidies.  The cost of insurance will be
sky-high, but this is not coercion.  It seems to me that
under your argument, perhaps you will prevail in the
plain words of the statute, there's a serious
constitutional problem if we adopt your argument.
MR. CARVIN:  Two points, Justice Kennedy.
One is the government's never made that
argument.  Number two, I'd like to think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Sometimes we think of
things the government doesn't.
(Laughter.)
MR. CARVIN:  Well, I certainly hope you do
in this case, but not -- not on this question.
What -- what I'm trying to, quite seriously, Justice
Kennedy, convey is if this was unconstitutional, then
the Medicaid statute that this Court approved in NFIB
would be unconstitutional.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Carvin, where the --
what would the consequence of unconstitutionality be?
Very often you have an ambiguous provision, could be
interpreted one way or another way.  If interpreting it
one way is unconstitutional, you interpret it the other
way.
MR. CARVIN:  Correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But do we have any case
which says that when there is a clear provision, if it
is unconstitutional, we can rewrite it?
MR. CARVIN:  And that -- and that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there any case we have
that says that?
MR. CARVIN:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course not. MR. CARVIN: And that was
really my point, Justice Kennedy.  Think about the
consequences when -- of the Medicaid deal as being
coercive.  22 states have said no to the Medicaid deal.
That has created a bizarre anomaly in the law; that if
people making less than the poverty line are not
available to any Federal funds to help them with health
insurance.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I fully understand
that, but I think the Court and the counsel for both
sides should confront the proposition that your argument
raises a serious constitutional question.  Now, I'm not
sure that the government would agree with that, but it
-- it is in the background of how we interpret this --
how we interpret this statute.
MR. CARVIN:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It may well be that you're
correct as to these words, and there's nothing we can
do.  I understand that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There are many --
MR. CARVIN:  A -- A, there's no savings
construction to echo Justice Scalia's point; but B, the
point I want to make on the straight-up
constitutionality is, if this is unconstitutional, then
all of the provisions in the U.S. Code that say to
States if you do something for No Child Left Behind, we
will --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this is -- this is
quite different.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I’m not sure, In -- in South Carolina
v. Dole where -- where the matter of funding for the
highway, suppose Congress said, and if you don't build
the highways, you have to go 35 miles an hour all over
the State.  We wouldn't allow that.
MR. CARVIN:  No.  Well, there, of course,
you would be interfering with a basic State prerogative
as to establish their limits, and they are -- the
condition is not related to that.  Here the condition is
perfectly related to it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Carvin --
MR. CARVIN:  We want to create something new
--
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Carvin, here's a --
you refer to the Medicaid example.  That's a familiar --
a grant-in-aid says to the State, here's the Federal
money and here's the conditions, take it or leave it.
That's one pattern.  But this pattern that we have says
flexible State.  You can -- you can have your program if
you want it, and if you don't, there's a fallback.
There's the Federal program.  I mean, that's a typical
pattern.  It's the pattern of the Clean Air Act.  You
can have a State implementation plan, but State, if you
don't give  up your plan, there's a Federal implementation
plan. ButI have never seen anything like this where it's
if you take what the statute says you can have in 1321,
then you get these disastrous consequences.
MR. CARVIN:  That's why this is much less
risky a deal for Congress.  And what distinguishes it
from Medicaid as the dissenting opinion in NFIB pointed
out.  In Medicaid, Congress is playing all in, take it
or leave it.  If they turn down the deal, then Medicaid
is completely thwarted.  Here, if they turn down the
subsidy deal, they still get the valuable benefits of an
Exchange and there's not a scintilla of --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What -- what are those
benefits?  What are the customers that can buy on it?
What are the insurers that will sell on it?
MR. CARVIN:  Well, three points.
One is we know textually that they thought
Exchanges without subsidies work, because again, they
have territorial Exchanges, but the government concedes
no subsidies.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's not --
MR. CARVIN:  We have legislative history
which --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Carvin, that's not --
that's not what you said previously when you were here
last time in this never-ending saga.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You said the -- you said
without the subsidies driving demand within the
Exchanges, insurance companies would have absolutely no
reason to offer their products through Exchanges.  And
then you said the insurance Exchanges cannot operate as
intended by Congress absent the subsidies.
MR. CARVIN:  That is entirely true.  They
wouldn't have operated as intended because Congress
intended all 50 States to take this deal.
So eliminating --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why create 1326 at
all?  Obviously, they thought that some States wouldn't.
MR. CARVIN:  Well, they thought it was
possible and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Very possible.
MR. CARVIN:  And then --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because they set up a
mechanism for that to happen.
MR. CARVIN:  And then they -- what happens?
You still get the Exchange.  It's not like Medicaid
where the entire Federal program is thwarted.  You get
the benefits that were lauded.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But nobody is going to go-- no
one’s going to visit the program if there are no subsidies
because not enough people will buy the programs to stay
in the Exchanges.
MR. CARVIN:  That is demonstrably untrue and
not reflected anywhere in the legislative history.  The
legislative history quite clearly contradicts that.
Many senators got up and said there are very valuable
benefits to the Exchange, one-stop shopping, Amazon, as
President Obama has said.  The government came in the
last case and told you these two things operate quite
independently.  We don't need Exchange without
subsidies.  In contrast, there's not a scintilla of
legislative history suggesting that without subsidies,
there will be a death spiral.  Not a word.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wait a minute.  That was
the whole purpose that drove this bill because States
had experimented with this, and those that didn't have
subsidies or other -- other provisions of the Act didn't
survive.
MR. CARVIN:  They didn't have --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You said it yourself in
the prior case.
MR. CARVIN:  No.  The prior case was about
the individual mandate.  The government came in and said
the individual mandate is necessary to affect death
spirals.  No one, in the findings in Congress or
anywhere else, suggested that subsidies were available.
Will subsidies reduce the number of people available on
the individual --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My problem -- my problem
is that -- the reverse.  You're talking about Congress,
how -- hiding, borrowing the phrase of one of my
colleagues, a -- a -- a huge thing in a mousetrap.
Okay?  Because do you really believe that States fully
understood that they were not going to get -- their
citizens were not going to get subsidies if they let the
Federal government?  What senator said that during the
hearings?
MR. CARVIN:  The same amount of senators who
said that subsidies were available on HHS Exchanges,
which is none.  They didn't deal with it in the
legislative history just as they didn't deal with
Medicaid because the statute was quite clear.
Let's talk about it in context again,
Justice Sotomayor.  The context is the only provisions
in the Act establishing any limit on the subsidies is
found in 36B.  So it's not a mouse hole.  It's the place
you'd expect to find it.  It's the only place in the Act
that limits subsidies to purchases made on Exchange.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's a --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't know think that's
quite right, Mr. Carvin.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's a tax code provision
that's an implementation provision.  It tells you how
you compute the individual amount.
MR. CARVIN:  It --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It -- it's not in the
body of the legislation where you would expect to find
this.
MR. CARVIN:  No.  Your Honor, if that's
true --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And if it --
MR. CARVIN:  Sorry.  Please.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What Justice Kagan just
read to you, you had the idea that the subsidies were
essential --
MR. CARVIN:  No.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- to have the thing
work.  That's what you told us last time.
MR. CARVIN:  What I told you was it wouldn't
work as expected, and that's because they thought this
deal would work just like the Medicaid deal where all 50
States would say yes, so you would have both of
congressional purposes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why in the world
would they set up this whole extra thing if they didn't
think anybody was going to take it?
MR. CARVIN:  Well, that -- that was my
response to Justice Sotomayor.  That -- that is
completely unsupported empirical observation made post
hoc by amicus.  There's no reflection of that in the
legislative history.  Indeed, the legislative history
refutes it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Carvin, we've
heard talk about this other case.  Did you win that
other case?
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So maybe it makes
sense that you have a different story today?
MR. CARVIN:  I'm really glad Your Honor said
that.
(Laughter.)
MR. CARVIN:  And -- and if I could return to
context because I think --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean -- I'm sorry, Mr.
Carvin.  Please.
MR. CARVIN:  Just very briefly, Justice
Kagan.  Very much appreciate it.
To -- to respond, we've already talked about the
context.  Section 1311 is a key part of this context.
It says in the strongest possible terms we want States
to run these Exchanges.  If you give unconditional
subsidies, then, of course, there is absolutely no
incentive for States to do it, and you have
fundamentally undermined that distinct statutory
purpose.  Whereas if you condition subsidies, Congress
accomplishes both of its goals.  Widespread subsidies,
plus State-run Exchanges.
In terms of terms of art, again, there is
language in the statute which says
"Exchanges," "Exchanges under the Act."  Those phrases
naturally encompass both HHS Exchanges and
State-established Exchanges.
And, yet, the Solicitor General is coming
here to tell you that a rational, English-speaking
person intending to convey subsidies available on HHS
Exchanges use the phrase "Exchanges established by the
State."
He cannot provide to you any rational reason
why somebody trying to convey the former would use the
latter formulation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Carvin, why
don't you take an extra ten minutes and maybe we'll give
you a little bit more of a chance to talk.
MR. CARVIN:  Okay.  Fine.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, then, I'll ask a
question.
(Laughter.)
MR. CARVIN:  Well, if you're going to ruin
my ten minutes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  I mean, let's go back
to this question of where -- where Congress put this
thing because putting aside constitutional issues, I
mean, there's at least a presumption, as we interpret
statutes, that Congress does not mean to impose heavy
burdens and Draconian choices on States unless it says
so awfully clearly.
And here -- and this goes back to what
Justice Ginsburg was saying -- there's really nothing
clear about this.  I mean, this took a year and a half
for anybody to even notice this language.
And as Justice Ginsburg said, it's -- it's
put in not in the place that you would expect it to be
put in, which is where it says to the -- the States,
here is the choice you have.  It's not even put in where
the statute defines who a qualified individual is or who
is entitled to get the subsidies.  Rather, it comes in
in this technical formula that's directed to the
Department of the Treasury saying how much the amount of
the subsidy should be.
And that seems to be -- it both makes no
sense from Congress's point of view, and in terms of our
own point of view, in terms of interpreting statutes,
that's not the clarity with which we require the
government to speak when it's upsetting Federal-State
relations like this.
MR. CARVIN:  I must respectfully disagree
for three reasons, Justice Kagan.  In the first place,
of course, you -- where else would you expect a tax
credit except in the tax code?  That's where this was.
You wouldn't put it in 42 U.S.C., which has nothing to
do with taxes.  It's the only place where Exchange is
limitations placed.
You have three audiences here, not just
States.  You have to tell taxpayers what they're
entitled to.  You have to tell insurance companies when
these subsidies are available.  And you have States.  So
you have to put it in 36B.
So the argument, I guess, the government is
making is what you should have done is put half of it in
36B and half it in 1321 which, of course, would have
confused everybody.  36B would say, Exchanges, period.
Then you'd go to 1321 and say, when we said Exchanges in
36B, we meant established by the State.
JUSTICE ALITO:  If I were a --
if I were a State official and I was trying to decide
whether my State should establish an Exchange, and I
wanted to know whether individuals who enrolled in a
plan on my possible State-established Exchange would get
a credit, where would I look?
MR. CARVIN:  Exactly.  The basic thesis here
is these Exchanges don't work without subsidies.  You've
read 1311.  You've read 1321.  Now you're going to go
find out where the subsidies are.  That's 36B.  They're
hypothesizing State --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  The -- I think not,
Mr. Carvin.  I mean, I think the place I would look to
find out about my choices is in the provision of the
statute that talks about my choices.
I think the last place I would look is a
provision of the statute that talks about -- what is
it -- coverage months for purposes of this subsection,
which, by the way, isn't even the right subsection, but
whatever.  That -- that's where I would look, is in --
is in where it talks about what a coverage month is?
MR. CARVIN:  But -- but, Your Honor, I've
already described the difficulties of putting it -- part
of it in 1321, right?  Because then you would create
this bizarre tax credit provision which is only half
true, and you wouldn't tell taxpayers and insurance
companies.  So I believe that's the complete answer.
But the other practical point I'd like to
make is they had three years to implement this.  And no
one thought the States were going to have to make a
decision overnight.  If the IRS had done its job, every
State would have been fully informed of the consequences
because presumably they've read 36B, and then they would
make an intelligent decision well in advance of the
two -- 2013 deadline.
So there's a bizarre notion that States were
somehow unable to read a statute or to -- or to read a
regulation is simply --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I really want -- I really
want to hear what you're going to say in your 5 to
10 minutes.  And if you want, only if you want, I would
be interested in your responses to the government's
brief, that if you read the words "established by the
State" without reference to the technical definition as
you wish, this isn't just about the taxes; it means
employers in Virginia don't have to make policy, don't
have to -- don't have to give policies, but if they have
one Maryland worker they do; it means that they never
can tighten up their Medicaid regulations, never, in 34
States -- but, of course, in the others they can; it
means that there's no qualified person ever to buy
anything on a -- an Exchange established by the
Secretary for the State, and they have two or three
other anomalies that have nothing to do with taxes, all
of which supports their argument that you have to read
this phrase technically according to the definition.
Now, that's their basic point.  I've tried
to summarize it.  Do as you wish you.  I just want
you to have 5 or 10 minutes to answer it.
MR. CARVIN:  Thank you.  And -- and -- and
the first point is there are no anomalies.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm going to clock that,
see if -- see if you get 5 minutes.
MR. CARVIN:  There are no -- the first point
I'd like to make is there is no anomaly stemming from
our interpretation of 36B.  The government agrees with
that.  Their biggest anomaly is this qualified
individuals point about how there would be nobody on HHS
Exchanges.  The Solicitor General is not going to stand
up here and tell you that if we prevail in our
interpretation of 36B, they would be obliged by the
logic of that opinion to empty out HHS Exchanges.  So we
all agree that there's no connection between 36B and the
qualified individual.  That's point one.
Point two is, if you want anomalies, their
interpretation of the statute requires 34 States today
to lose all Medicaid coverage.  Why is that?  Because of
the provisions on 64a through 66a of the government's
brief, there are various requirements that the State, on
pain of losing all of its Medicaid funds, must
coordinate between the State-established Exchange, the
State agency for CHIP, and the State agency for Medicaid
in terms of secure interface and enrollment.
Now that makes perfect sense if "Exchange
established by the State" means what it says, but they
think it encompasses HHS Exchanges.  Well, the State
cannot ensure coordination between HHS Exchanges and the
State agencies, and none of the 34 are doing it today.
So under their atextual reading of the statute, 34
States will suffer the penalty that this Court found in
NFIB as unconstitutionally coercive.
As to this Medicaid maintenance anomaly, the
government agrees that the purpose of this provision was
to freeze Medicaid payments until you had an Exchange
with subsidies, which makes sense, right?  You want to
coordinate the two.
And that's exactly what this provision means
under our interpretation.  Until you have an Exchange
with subsidies, the States will be frozen.
The government says, that thing ended on
January 1, 2014.  That's a figment of their imagination.
It's nowhere in the statute; plus which it makes no
sense.  Before 2014, the States were powerless to have
an Exchange with subsidies, right?  They couldn't do it.
So there was a 3-year freeze on Medicaid that they were
powerless to get out of.
After 2014, if they don't want to have their
Medicaid frozen, all they have to do is establish an
Exchange.  So it's a less harsh restriction on States,
plus which it gives them another incentive in addition
to the subsidies to create the State Exchange, which is
the purpose enunciated in 1311.
I don't know -- oh, as to, yeah, maybe
somebody would from another -- if you had an employee
that let -- lived in other State, maybe he would be
subject to the employer mandate.  Why is that an
anomaly?  Congress likes the employer mandate.  Of
course they wanted to expand it.  They also never
thought it would really happen because, again, what they
thought was going to happen was there wouldn't be
neighboring States without it because nobody was going
to turn down this extraordinarily generous deal.
I don't know if my 5 minutes are up, but
that -- that's -- that's my response to these anomalies.
I think that you --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  As I understand it --
MR. CARVIN:  I think if I could --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Wow.  You've been talking a
long time.
MR. CARVIN:  Yes.  Yes.  Sorry.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You have two more sentences.
MR. CARVIN:  Even if there were anomalies in
these other sections, you don't transport them to 36B
which is concededly neither absurd and furthers the
purposes of the Act, just like in Utility Air, because
the word pollutants didn't work with one section, you
don't spread it like a virus throughout the rest of the
Act.  You cure it in that provision --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Those were two long
sentences --
MR. CARVIN:  -- if and when there's any
litigation.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think -- I think --
MR. CARVIN:  Oh, it was a long sentence.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  I -- I think I'm right
that Justice Breyer's question about anomalies, which
are replete in the Act, under your interpretation, did
not talk about what I think is one of the most glaring
ones, which is this qualified individuals thing, that
you're essentially setting up a system in which these
Federal Exchanges, that there will be no customers and,
in fact, there will be no products, because Section 1311
says that the Exchange shall make health plans available
to qualified individuals, and then the next section says
that qualified individual means an individual who
resides in the State that established the Exchange.
So under your theory, if Federal Exchanges
don't qualify as Exchanges established by the State,
that means Federal Exchanges have no customers.
MR. CARVIN:  Which, of course, is not the
reading that the government's giving to it because
they're not going to tell you --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's -- that's
because they don't share your theory.
MR. CARVIN:  No, no.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Under your theory --
MR. CARVIN:  No.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that's the result.
MR. CARVIN:  Well, no.  Let me be as clear
as I can.  If we prevail in this case, they are not
going to empty out the HHS Exchanges because they
understand that there are numerous defenses even if you
interpret "established by the State" literally in the
qualified individuals provision.
Number one defense that they will use is, it
says you have to be a qualified individual with respect
to an Exchange.  As Justice Breyer pointed out, the
statutory definition of Exchange is a 1311 Exchange.  So
they're only talking about State Exchanges, not these
HHS Exchanges, and it is in Section 1312, which
immediately follows 1311, before 1321.
Number two, "qualified individual" doesn't
mean that -- that means you're guaranteed access.  It
doesn't mean if you're not qualified, you're absolutely
denied access.  We know that from the illegal alien
provision, which says illegal aliens are neither
qualified individuals nor eligible for subsidies.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ah, but look at the -- look
at the prisoner provision, which it says prisoners
shouldn't be treated as qualified individuals.  So under
your theory, this statute effectively said that
prisoners should be able to enroll on Federal Exchanges?
That makes no sense.
MR. CARVIN:  It makes perfect sense to say
the States get a choice.  Think about somebody who's in
prison in February, they're getting out in April,
they've got to buy insurance under the individual
mandate.  So if you said nobody who's incarcerated can
buy insurance, that means they wouldn't be able to buy
insurance during the relevant enrollment period.  It
makes perfect sense to give States the flexibility to
say, as to those incarcerated principles, you can make
them available for Exchanges, but under illegal aliens
we don't want to, which is why we are saying they are
neither qualified nor eligible.
Even if Justice -- even if you don't find
that the most pristine logic to be applied to a statute,
remember, we are interpreting these statutes to avoid an
absurd result.  And it's a basic principle of statutory
construction that you will give a plausible, if not the
most persuasive, reading to a statute to avoid the
result.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But we are interpreting a
statute generally to make it make sense as a whole,
right?  We look at the whole text.  We don't look at
four words.  We look at the whole text, the particular
context, the more general context, try to make
everything harmonious with everything else.  I think you
said, even at the very beginning of this argument as we
were going back and forth about my hypothetical, that,
of course, context matters and context might make all
the difference with respect to what those five words
mean.
And I think what we're suggesting is that,
if you look at the entire text, it's pretty clear that
you oughtn't to treat those five words in the way you
are.
MR. CARVIN:  I've given you the contextual
points before.  I think the key one that I'd like to
convey to you, Justice Kagan, is Section 1311.  You say
the -- the statute must work harmoniously.  If you
provide a -- subsidies to HHS Exchanges, you have
essentially gutted Section 1311's strong preference for
State Exchanges.
What will happen is precisely what did
happen under the IRS rule, two-thirds of the States are
saying no, we're not going to undertake this thankless
task of running these Exchanges with no incentives to do
so.  So yes, it -- what I have here in terms of what the
statute means is 36B quite clearly saying Exchanges are
available only on States.  I have 1311 explaining why
they limited subsidies to that.  And there is no
contrary legislative history at all.
What do they have, an atextual reading of
36B, which they can't explain why anybody would have
used those words if they wanted to convey Exchanges, a
rule that completely undermines the purposes of -- of
1311 and no supporting legislative history.  So under
all the legal materials that this Court normally used to
discern what statute means, we clearly prevail.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
General Verrilli, you'll have extra ten
minutes as well.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
Standing has been raised, so let me start by
telling you where we stand on  standing and then I'd
appreciate the opportunity after that to summarize what
I think are the two key points in this case.
Now, with respect to standing, the question
-- the case or controversy question turns on whether any
of the four Petitioners is liable for the tax penalty
for 2014.
Now, this case was litigated in -- in the
district court in 2013 based on projections on the part
of each of the four Petitioners that they would earn a
certain income in 2014.  They filed declarations saying
that.  With respect to 2 of the 4, the projections were
-- of their income were such that they would qualify for
the unaffordability exception and they wouldn't have
standing.  With respect to the other 2, their
projections were such that they wouldn't qualify for the
unaffordability exception and they would have standing.
But those were projections in 2013 about their income in
2014.  2014 has now come and gone, and we know -- we
don't know, but Petitioners know whether any of the 4
have, in fact -- are, in fact, liable for the tax
penalty and that will depend on whether their -- their
actual income in 2014 matched their projections.
Now, Mr. Carvin said there was factfinding
about this.  I'm afraid that's not correct.  The -- the
Petitioners -- the Petitioners did file a motion for
summary judgment, but the case was decided on the basis
of the government's motion to dismiss before discovery
and without any factfinding.
I'm assuming because Mr. Carvin has not said
anything about the absence of a tax penalty, that, at
least, 1 of the 4 has and is, in fact, liable for a tax
penalty, but that's the key standing question.
Now, with respect to the veterans point,
Your Honor, if it is the case, as Mr. Carvin tells us,
that Mr. Hurst was a veteran for only 10 months, then I
think he's correct, he would not qualify for VA health
care because you generally have to serve two years.  So
that's where we are on standing.
Now, if I could turn to the merits.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So are you saying one
person does have standing?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, no.  It will depend
on whether as a factual matter 1 of the 4 has and is, in
fact, liable for the tax penalty for 2014.  And that's
information that is not in the government's possession;
it is in the possession of Petitioners' counsel.  And I
should make one more point, with respect to 2015, there
were no projections, there's nothing in the record about
the possible income of any of the Petitioners for 2015,
so there's really nothing that would establish a case of
controversy for 2014.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you're surely
not raising a standing question with us here for the
first time at oral argument, are you?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice,
as I said, that based on the projections, it is our --
it was our understanding that at least 1 of the 4 would
be liable for a tax penalty.  The question of standing
has been raised and I've tried to identify for the Court
what I think is the relevant question, which is whether
any one of the 4 has, in fact -- is, in fact, liable for
a tax penalty because --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is -- this is
on a motion to dismiss, right?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, that's correct,
Your Honor, but it does also go to this Court's
jurisdiction.  Because if there's no -- if none of the 4
is liable for a tax penalty for 2014, there just isn't
the case or controversy.  None of them is liable,
there's no -- there's no injury.  And so I do think
that's ultimately the relevant question here and -- with
respect to standing.  I don't think there's a question
about veteran status, but I do think that's the relevant
question.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't the question before us
as to standing whether the district court correctly held
in the motion to dismiss context that there was
standing?  That may not be the end of the matter, but
don't we have to -- isn't that what's before us?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, that -- that may be
-- yes.  But then you -- and you might alternatively
think about this as a question of mootness, I guess, in
that, you know, based on the projection, there was a
case or controversy, but if the projection didn't come
to pass and none of the plaintiffs is liable for a tax
penalty, then the case or controversy no longer exists.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what are you
suggesting?  Should we have a -- should we have a trial
here?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, I'm not suggesting
anything of the kind.
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- on this issue and find
what the facts are?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Justice Alito, I did not
raise standing affirmatively, the Court raised it.  And
I'm just doing my best to let the Court know what our
position is on standing.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, you -- would you
send it back then to -- to the district court?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I guess no.  I
guess what I've said is that -- that Mr. Carvin hasn't
suggested that there's no plaintiff liable for a tax
penalty.  Based on that, I'm inferring that at least one
of the Petitioners --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
--
GENERAL VERRILLI:
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
representation by him?
GENERAL VERRILLI:
and I'm not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
Would you -- would you
-- has standing.
Why wouldn't we accept a
There's no reason not to
If he -- if he makes a
representation that at least 1 of the 4 is -- has -- was
liable in 2014 and is liable in 2000 -- or will be
liable in 2015 --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So I guess what I'm
saying --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, we know at least
one of them won't because that's --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  What I'm saying about
that is I'm actually going to step further than that,
Justice Sotomayor, given that there hasn't been -- I'm
willing to accept the absence of a representation as an
indication that there is a case or controversy here,
and -- and so that's why, Mr. Chief Justice, we haven't
raised standing and that's what it -- but I do think
that the key question is whether one of the four is
liable for a tax penalty.  You have to have that to have
a case or controversy in the case.
If I could now, let me please turn to the
merits and summarize what I think are the two key
points.  First, our reading follows directly from the
text of the Act's applicable provisions and it's really
the only way to make sense of both Section 36B and the rest
of the Act.  Textually, their reading produces an
incoherent statute that doesn't work; and second, our
reading is compelled by the Act's structure and design.
Their reading forces HHS to establish rump Exchanges
that are doomed to fail.  It makes a mockery of the
statute's express -- status express textual promise of
State flexibility.  It precipitates the insurance market
death spirals that the statutory findings specifically
say the statute was designed to avoid, and of course it
revokes the promise of affordable care for millions of
Americans.  That cannot be the statute that Congress
intended.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course it could be.  I
mean it may not be the statute they intended.  The
question is whether it's the statute that they wrote.  I
mean, you know, there -- there -- there are no
provisions in a statute that turn out to be ill --
ill-considered and ill -- ill-conceived.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So it's not the statute
that they wrote, and the reason it's not the statute
that they wrote, I think -- I want to actually start, if
I could, picking up I think on a variation of the
hypothetical that Justice Kagan ask -- asked.  In
Petitioners' brief they throw down the gauntlet with
respect to a hypothetical about airports, and that -- a
statute requires a State to construct an airport, it
says the Federal government shall construct such airport
if the State doesn't, and no one would think that the
Federal government's airport was an airport constructed
by the State.
Well, what I would say to that is that if
those statutory provisions were conjoined with a
provision that said airplanes may only land at airports
constructed by the State, that you would conclude
immediately that what -- that -- that that Federally
constructed airport qualifies as an airport constructed
by the State, and the -- because otherwise the statute
would make no sense.  And the same exact thing is true
here.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There are no statutes that
make no sense.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  This one makes sense.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that the case? Every
statute must make sense and we will -- we will twist the
words as necessary to make it make -- that can't be the
rule.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That isn't the rule.  But
the rule --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course not.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- is that you read --
that you don't read statutory provisions in isolation;
you read them in context.  The rule is that you read
them in order to ensure that the statute operates as a
harmonious whole.  You read them so that you don't
render the statutory provisions ineffective.  You read
them to promote Federal-State balance --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where that is possible.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- you read --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, you acknowledge
that all of what you're saying only applies where there
are alternative readings that are reasonable.  You pick
the one that will do all the things that you say.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And there is -- there
is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But, but -- if -- if it can
only reasonably mean one thing, it will continue to mean
that one thing even if it has untoward consequences for
the rest of the statute.  No?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  With respect to this
statute, first, let me -- I want to make two points.
First --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Answer me in principle.  I
mean, is it not the case that if the only reasonable
interpretation of a particular provision produces
disastrous consequences in the rest of the statute, it
nonetheless means what it says.  Is that true or not?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think there are --
there are a couple of limitations on that principle.
The first is if what you have is a situation in which
the -- that it creates conflict within a statutory scheme,
then the Court's got to do its best to try to harmonize
and reconcile the provisions.  And secondly --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I disagree with that.
You have a single case in which we have said the
provision is not ambiguous, it means this thing, but,
Lord, that would make a terrible statute, so we will
interpret it to mean something else.  Do you have one
case where we've ever said that?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think -- I think Brown
& Williamson is a good example of that.  In Brown &
Williamson, the Court said, look, the definition of drug
and drug delivery device would actually seem
unambiguously to cover tobacco, but when you read that
provision in context, and considering the full scope of
the regulatory regime, it can't possibly mean that.
But let me -- let me actually work through
the text here, because I do think I can show you that
there's a quite reasonable reading of this statutory
text that allows you to affirm and requires you to
affirm the government's position.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But, General Verrilli,
before we get too immersed in a number of provisions of
this, could you respond to a question that was asked
during Mr. Carvin's argument.  If we adopt Petitioners'
interpretation of this Act, is it unconstitutionally
coercive?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So the -- here's what I
would say about that, Justice Alito.  I think that it
would -- certainly be a novel constitutional
question, and I think that I'm not prepared to say to
the Court today that it is unconstitutional.  It would
be my duty to defend the statute and on the authority of
New York v.  United States, I think we would do so.  But
I don't think there's any doubt that it's a novel
question, and if the Court believes it's a serious
question --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it a -- I was going to
say does novel mean difficult?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because it -- it -- it
does seem to me that if the Petitioners' argument is
correct, this is just not a rational choice for the
States to make and that they're being coerced.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So what I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that you then have to
invoke the standard of constitutional avoidance.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, what I was going to
say, Justice Kennedy, is to the extent the Court
believes that this is a serious constitutional question
and this does rise to the level of something approaching
coercion, then I do think the doctrine of constitutional
avoidance becomes another very powerful reason to read
the statutory text our way.  Because I do think -- and I
do think with respect to the point that Your Honor's
making, remember, it's not just -- it's not just a
situation in which there is onerous conditions, onerous
consequences for State residents.  It's also a profound
problem of notice here, that, you know, if you read
Petitioners' -- if you take Petitioners' reading of the
statute, then the idea that States were given added --
you can't possibly justify this as adequate notice to
the States.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. -- General
Verrilli, let me ask you this about notice.  We get lots
and lots of amicus briefs from States.  And we got two
amicus briefs from States here; 34 states I think is --
that's the number of States that declined to or failed
to establish a State Exchange?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, if they were all caught
off guard and they were upset about this, you would
expect them to file an amicus brief telling us that.
But actually, of the 34, only 6 of them signed the brief
that was submitted by a number of States making that
argument.  23 States, 23 jurisdictions submitted that
brief; 17 of them are States that established State
exchanges.  Only 6 of the States that didn't establish
State exchanges signed that brief, how do you account
for that?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So, I -- I guess I'd make
two points about that, Justice Alito.  First, you've got
22 States there, States in both camps, all of whom told
you that they didn't understand the statute that way.
Now, with respect to the other 8 States that
filed the amicus brief on the other side, I actually
think there's quite an important point that goes to
their understanding of what this Act did.  Remember,
this is an IRS rule that we're talking about here, and
the IRS put out a notice of proposed rulemaking saying
this is what we intend to do, and several of these
States -- Oklahoma, Indiana, Nebraska -- they filed
rulemaking comments in that -- in that proceeding.  And
if you look at those rulemaking comments you will see
that they address a number of issues, and they say
nothing, nothing about the -- the issue that's before
the Court now.
So if they really understood the statute as
denying subsidies in States that did not set up their
own exchanges, that would have front and center in their
rulemaking comments, but they said nothing about it and
I think that tells you a good deal about where --
what -- what everybody understood that this statute
was --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there's another point
on notice on this Pennhurst argument that seems curious
to me.  Usually when this argument comes up, a State has
signed up for a Federal program and then they say, oh,
my gosh, we didn't realize what we had gotten ourselves
into.  But here, it's not too late for a State to
establish an exchange if we were to adopt Petitioners'
interpretation of the statute.  So going forward, there
would be no harm.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, let -- let me
address that directly, and then I'd like to make a
broader point about statutory context in response.  Now
directly, of course, I don't -- I don't think it's
possible to say there would be no harm.  The tax credits
will be cut off immediately and you will have very
significant, very adverse effects immediately for
millions of people in many States in their insurance
markets --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I said -- I've said
going forward.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And then --
JUSTICE ALITO:  After -- after the current
tax year.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And then going --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Would it not be possible if
we were to adopt Petitioners' interpretation of the
statute to stay the mandate until the end of this tax
year as we have done in other cases where we have
adopted an interpretation of the constitutional -- or a
statute that would have very disruptive consequences
such as the Northern Pipeline case.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Sure.  Northern Pipeline
is an example of doing that, and it will be up to the
Court to decide whether it has the authority to do that.
I will say, this does seem different than Northern
Pipeline to me, because this is about money going out of
the Federal treasury, which is a different scenario.
But if the Court -- obviously, if that's where the Court
is going and that's what the Court thinks the proper
disposition is, that would reduce the disruption.
But what I think is another important point
to make here just as a practical matter, the idea that a
number of States, all of these States or a significant
number are going to be able to in the 6 months between
when a decision in the this case would come out and when
the new -- the new year for insurance purposes will
begin we'll be able to set up Exchanges, get them up, up
and running and get all the approvals done I think is
completely unrealistic.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How long has it taken --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, for -- just to give
you an example of the current time line, Justice
Ginsburg, the -- in order to be -- in order to have an
exchange approved and insurance policies on the exchange
ready for the 2016 year, those approvals have to occur
by May of 2015.  Okay.  So that gives you a sense of
the -- of the time line that HHS is operating under.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about -- what about
Congress?  You really think Congress is just going to
sit there while -- while all of these disastrous
consequences ensue.
I mean, how often have we come out with a
decision such as the -- you know, the bankruptcy court
decision?  Congress adjusts, enacts a statute that --
that takes care of the problem.  It happens all the
time.  Why is that not going to happen here?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, this Congress, Your
Honor, I -- I --
(Laughter.)
GENERAL VERRILLI:  You know, I mean, of
course, theoretically -- of course, theoretically they
could.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I don't care what
Congress you're talking about.  If the consequences are
as disastrous as you say, so many million people
without -- without insurance and whatnot, yes, I think
this Congress would act.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And -- but the relevant
question -- and then I'm going to try to get back to
the point I was trying to make in response to Justice
Alito's question.
The relevant question here is:  What did the
Congress that enacted this statute in 2010 do?  Did they
really set up a system in which the States are subject
to the kind of onerous situation that the Petitioner
claims?  And I think there are three textual
indications -- objective, textual indications that that
cannot possibly have been the statutory scheme that
Congress tried to set up.
First is the existence of the Federal
Exchanges.  It would make no sense, no sense for
Congress to have provided for Federal Exchanges if,
as -- as Mr. Carvin suggests, the statutory design was
supposed to result in every State establishing its
Exchange.
Second --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, wouldn't it have
been -- again, talking about Federalism -- a mechanism
for States to show that they had concerns about the
wisdom and the workability of the Act in the form that
it was passed?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So, Justice Kennedy, I
think the Federalism values are promoted by our
interpretation, because if -- if that is, indeed, what a
State thought, if a State really would have preferred
that -- not to have the State government participate in
the implementation of this Act, for reasons that Your
Honor identified, the structure of the Act that Congress
put in place and that we're advocating for today fully
vindicates that concern.  They can decide not to
participate without having any adverse consequences
visited upon the citizens of the State.
And that's why our reading is the
pro-Federalism reading.  It's their reading that seems
to me that is the anti-Federalism reading, and that's a
powerful reason to reject it.
And if I could go to the second statutory
point, which is related to what we're talking about,
Justice Kennedy, which is Section 1321, says that this
statute is designed to afford State flexibility.  State
flexibility.  It would be an Orwellian sense of the word
"flexibility" to use it in the manner that Petitioners
say the statute uses it, because it's the polar opposite
of flexibility.
And the third point, seems to me, is the
notice point, that if, indeed, the plan was, as Mr.
Carvin said, that every State was going to establish an
Exchange for itself and that that would cure all of the
massive statutory anomalies and textual anomalies and
absurdities and impossibilities that his reading
provides for, if that was really the plan, then the
consequence for the States would be in neon lights in
this statute.  You would want to make absolutely sure
that every State got the message.
But instead what you have is a subclause in
Section 36B, which is a provision that addresses the
eligibility of individual taxpayers for taxing purposes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is not the most
elegantly drafted statute.  It was -- it was pushed
through on expedited procedures and didn't have the kind
of consideration by a conference committee, for example,
that -- that statutes usually do.
What -- what would be so surprising if --
if, among its other imperfections, there is the
imperfection that what the States have to do is not --
is not obvious enough?  It doesn't strike me as
inconceivable.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So, Justice Scalia, I --
I'm going to answer that question by talking about the
legislative process, because I think it is quite
relevant and I think it ought to be quite relevant even
to you with respect to the question you just asked.
The language here in 36B was not the product
of some last-minute deal, it wasn't the product of
scrambling at the end.  The language that emerged here,
the statutory structure with the language of 36B about
tax credits, the language that's in 1311, the language
that's in 1321 was the product of the Senate Finance
Committee markup, which went on for weeks and weeks.
It was a public -- it was a public hearing.
It -- frankly, it was covered by C-SPAN.  You can go
watch it on the C-SPAN archives if you want to; and you
will see coming out of that that the -- that the
understanding, the clear understanding was with this
statutory setup would result in subsidies being
available in every State.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There were senators, were
there not, who were opposed to having the Federal
government run the whole thing, because they thought
that would lead to a single-payer system, which -- which
some people wanted.  And the explanation for this
provision is it prevents -- it prevents the -- the
Federalization of -- of the entire thing.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  Justice Scalia, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's -- that's certainly
a plausible explanation --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- as to why the provision
is there.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Mr. Carvin has floated
that as an explanation and he -- and he suggests that it
was Senator Ben Nelson who required it.  We -- there is
absolutely no contemporaneous evidence, none whatsoever,
that anybody thought that way, that the -- the solution
to the problem that Your Honor's identified is what
Congress did by having States have the option to set up
their own Exchanges with State-by-State Federal
fallbacks rather than a national system.
Senator Nelson has made clear, he has stated
that he had no intention of the kind.  There's no
contemporaneous evidence at all that anyone did.  And I
do -- and what Mr. Carvin has suggested is that this was
the product of some deal to try to get votes so the Act
could get passed.
What I would suggest to Your Honor is that
there is objective proof that that is not true.  The --
the provisions in the Act that were negotiated at the
end to secure the necessary votes are in Title X of the
Act.  And if you look in the -- in the Act, Pages 833 to
924 -- that's Title X -- you can see all of the
amendments.  Not a single one has anything to do with
the statutory language before the Court now.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the puzzle that's
created by -- by your interpretation is this:  If
Congress did not want the phrase "established by the
State" to mean what that would normally be taken to
mean, why did they use that language?  Why didn't they
use other formulations that appear elsewhere in the Act?
Why didn't they say, "established under the Act"?  Why
didn't they say, "established within the State"?  Why
didn't they include a provision saying that an Exchange
established by HHS is a State Exchange when they have a
provision in there that does exactly that for the
District of Columbia and for the territories?  It says
that they are deemed to be States for purposes of this
Act.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So why would they do that?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So, of course, the
provision says -- doesn't say "established by the State"
with a period after State.  It says "established by the
State under Section 1311."  And our position textually
is -- and we think this is clearly the better reading of
the text -- that by cross-referencing Section 1311,
effectively what Congress is doing is saying that
Exchanges established through whatever mechanism,
Exchanges set up by the States themselves, Exchanges set
up by --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you're saying that
by -- by cross-reference to 1311, they really mean 1311
and 1321?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  Well, let me -- and
I do think that, and let me walk through why I think
that's true.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  That -- that
seems to me to go in the wrong direction --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- for your case --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- not the
right direction.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, I think it goes in
the right direction, if you'll just ride with me for a
little bit, Justice Kennedy, on this.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, before you -- before
you get on to that, that -- your answer doesn't explain
why -- why "by the State" is in there.  Then why didn't
they say "established under 1311"?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, so the second point
is that wherever this provision appears in the Act,
"established by the State under Section 1311," it's
doing work; and the work it's doing is saying, what
we're talking about is the specific Exchange established
in the specific State as opposed to general rules for
Exchanges.  If you look at the Medicaid
Maintenance-of-Effort provision that -- it works the
same way.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why didn't they say
"in the State"?  That's the phrase you just used, "in
the State."  Why didn't they say "in the State"?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Because -- I suppose they
could have, but it worked perfectly well this way.  If
you look at the qualified individual provision, it's
clearly how they're using it with respect to the
qualified individual provision.  And with respect to
that provision, it says a qualified individual is a
person who is located -- who resides in the State that
established the Exchange.  Clearly, what they're talking
about is a geographical reference to the particular
State.  That's what's going on there and what's going on
every time the -- the statute uses that phrase.  So it's
doing that work, and that's why it's in there.
But now if I could go back to your point,
Justice Kennedy, it says, "established by the State
under Section 1311."  Section 1311(b)(1) says, "Each
State shall establish an American Health Benefits
Exchange for the State."  It's not, as Mr. Carvin said,
an urging that States do it.  It says, "Each State shall
establish."
Now, we know that when Congress used that
language, "each State shall establish," it must have
meant something more inclusive than each State
government shall itself set up the Exchange.
We know that because Congress is legislating
against the backdrop of the Tenth Amendment, and so it
couldn't impose that requirement.  And we know that
because of Section 1321, because Section 1321 provides
the means by which the 1311(b)(1) requirement is
satisfied.  It will be satisfied by a State electing to
meet the Federal requirements for Exchanges, or it can
be satisfied in the event that a State doesn't or tries,
but comes up short by HHS stepping in and establishing
the Exchange.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So when the statute says,
"each State shall establish," it really means the
Federal government shall establish if a State doesn't
establish.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think the right way --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And if that were the correct
interpretation, you wouldn't 1321 at all.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So -- no.  I think the
right way to think about this, Justice Alito, is that
what's going on here is that -- the right place to
focus, let me put it that way.  The right place to focus
here is not on the who, but on the what; on the thing
that gets set up and whether it qualifies as an Exchange
established by the State, and these Exchanges do
qualify.
And the reason they qualify is because they
fulfill the requirement in Section 1311(b)(1) that each
State shall establish an Exchange.  And 1321 tells you
that because it says to the HHS that when a -- when a
State hasn't elected to meet the Federal requirements,
HHS steps in, and what the HHS does is set up the
required Exchange.  It says such Exchange, which is
referring to the -- immediately prior to the required
Exchange where the only Exchange required in the Act is
an Exchange under Section 1311(b)(1).
So it has to be that that's -- that what HHS
is doing under the plain text of the statute is
fulfilling the requirement of the Section 1311(b)(1)
that each State establish an Exchange, and for that
reason we say it qualifies as an Exchange established by
the State.  That's reinforced, as Justice Breyer
suggested earlier, by the definition which says that an
Exchange is an Exchange established under Section 1311.
1311, again, has 1311(b)(1) which says each State shall
establish an Exchange.
And it has to be that way because
Petitioners have conceded, and it's at page 22 of their
brief, that an Exchange that HHS sets up is supposed to
be the same Exchange that Petitioners say function just
like an Exchange that the State sets up for itself.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you're -- you're
putting a lot of weight on the -- on the -- one word,
such, such Exchange.  Such -- it seems to me the most
unrealistic interpretation of "such" to mean the Federal
government shall establish a State Exchange.
Rather, it seems to me "such" means an
Exchange for the State rather than an Exchange of the
State.  How can the government -- Federal government
establish a State Exchange.  That is gobbledygook.  You
know, "such" must mean something different.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It isn't gobbledygook,
Justice Scalia.  And I think about it and I go back to
something that Justice Alito asked earlier.  And
that -- if the language of 36B were exactly the same as
it is now, and the statute said in 1321 that an Exchange
set up -- set up by HHS shall qualify as an Exchange
established by the State for purposes of Section 1311,
you wouldn't change the language of 36B one iota, and
that wouldn't be any doubt in anyone's mind that
the -- that subsidies were available on Federal
Exchanges.  And what we're saying is that effectively
reading 1311 and 1321 together, that is what the statute
does.
And that is certainly -- that is a
reasonable reading of the statute.  It is really the
only reading of the statute that allows you to be
faithful to the text of 1311(b)(1), the word "shall,"
and to the Tenth Amendment.  In order for their --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The word "such" means
not -- not just the Exchange that the State was supposed
to set up, but it means the State Exchange.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It means an Exchange that
qualifies as satisfy -- as an exchange established by
the State because it satisfies the requirement of
1311(b)(1).
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  You -- you have to say
it means the State Exchange.  You have to -- your case
hinges on the fact that a Federal Exchange is a State
Exchange for purposes --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It hinges on -- it hinges
on it qualifying as the State Exchange or being
equivalent to the State Exchange for the purpose of the
operation of the statute.  That is a reasonable reading
of the particular textual provisions, and once you've
concluded that it's a reasonable reading of the
particular textual provisions, then you have to read it
the way that we say it needs -- it is to be read because
it is the only way to make sense of the statute as a
whole.  It is the only way to bring it into harmony with
the Act's qualified individual and qualified health plan
provisions which do lead to what they admit is an
absurdity under their reading under the law.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Would you agree that
there -- that there are provisions of the Act where the
exact same phrase, "established by the State," has to be
read to mean established by the State and not by HHS?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't --
JUSTICE ALITO:  There are some provisions
like that.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  They've pointed out some,
but I think they're wrong about each one, and I don't
know what Your Honor has in mind.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Well, let's take
one -- let's take one.  I'd be interested in your answer
to it.  42 U.S.C. Section 1396w-3(h)(1)(D) which says
that each State shall establish procedures to ensure
that an Exchange established by the State utilizes a
secure electronic interface.  And they say that if that
is read to -- if "Exchange established by the State"
there is read to mean an HHS Exchange, that means that
the State in which that Exchange is established is
responsible for making sure that the Federal Exchange
has a secure electronic interface.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  They're just wrong
about that.  It's just completely wrong.  The statute
says that the State shall -- first of all, the statutory
obligation is addressed to the State Medicaid and CHIP
agencies.  What it says is they shall establish
procedures to ensure the coordination.  HHS has issued
regulations setting forth what that statutory provision
requires of States in those circumstance.  Every State
where there is a federally facilitated Exchange has met
the requirements and fulfilled them, and it worked
perfectly fine.  There's no anomaly there at all.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And the State --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It met -- it met the
requirements of the regulations you say, but do the
regulations track the statute?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, they do.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do -- do they give the
State authority to -- to say whether or not these --
these conditions have been met?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  They -- the requirements
are imposed on the State Medicaid and CHIP end of the
relationship.  That's what the statute does, and the
regulations  implement that statutory requirement, and
it's satisfied in every State.
And, of course, as Your Honor reading it to
me said, it does say -- and I think that proves our
point.  The statute says each State shall.  It doesn't
say States that have set up Exchanges for themselves
shall.  It says each State shall.  It presupposes that
there is going to be something that qualifies as an
Exchange established by the State in every State.  So
there's no anomaly there, and if Your Honor wants to ask
me about any of the other ones, you can, but I -- there
are no anomalies frankly.
JUSTICE ALITO:  As I understand your answer
to be that there are Federal regulations telling the
States what they have to do here, and they've all done
it.  But the fact remains that the State has some
obligation under the regulations to make sure that there
is a proper interface with the Federal Exchange.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  On the State's side of
the interface, yes.  But that's the CHIP and Medicaid
agencies.  Those are State government agencies, and it's
their side of the interface that the statute governs.
And, you know, as I said, I don't think
there are anomalies of our reading, but if they are,
they pale in comparison to the anomalies on the other
side.  I mean, I really do want to focus on this point
about the qualified health plan and the qualified
individual, because the statute is quite clear in
Section 1311 that an Exchange, not an Exchange
established by the State, but an Exchange can only sell
a qualified health plan.  It is forbidden from selling a
health plan that is not a qualified health plan.  And
that's not an Exchange established by the State.  It is
an Exchange.
Now, the statute also says that to certify a
health plan as qualified, the Exchange has to decide
that it is in the interest of qualified individuals.
Now, qualified individuals are persons who
reside in the State that established the Exchange.  So
if you read the statute, the language, the way
Mr. Carvin reads it instead of the way we read it, you
come to the conclusion and in a State in a federally
facilitated Exchange, there are no qualified
individuals.  Therefore, the Exchange cannot certify a
qualified health plan as being in the interest of
qualified individuals because there aren't any, so there
aren't any qualified health plans that can lawfully be
sold on the Exchange.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the provision that
says that only a -- only a qualified individual can
be -- can enroll in a plan under an Exchange?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So let -- the -- the -- I
will address that, but I just want to make clear the
provision I'm talking about with respect to the -- the
prohibition on selling a qualified health plan to
anybody on -- on anything other than a qualified health
plan on an Exchange is 1311(d)(2)(B), which is at page
8a of the appendix to our brief.  It's absolutely
unambiguous.  An Exchange, not an Exchange established
by the State, an Exchange may not make available any
health plan that is not a qualified health plan.  So --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Qualified health plan.  But
what's the provision you were referring to when you said
that an Exchange may enroll only a qualified individual?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I -- what they --
what the statute says throughout is that -- that
qualified individuals are eligible to purchase on
Exchanges, and it's the necessary meaning of that phrase
that if you are not a qualified individual, then you are
not eligible to purchase health care on an Exchange
because otherwise, the word qualified would not have any
meaning.  The whole -- the meaning of the word qualified
is to distinguish between people who are eligible and
people who are ineligible.  And as a policy matter, it
wouldn't make any sense because think of the people who
are not qualified individuals.  The people who don't
live in the State, the people in prison, and they're
unlawfully documented aliens.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is part of Section
1312.  A person qualified to purchase on an Exchange
must, quote, reside in the State that established the
Exchange.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right.  And there are no
such people in 34 States under Mr. Carvin's theory of
the statute.  So it just doesn't -- it just -- you just
run into a textual brick wall.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well I understand your argument
is that it's a -- it's a logical inference from a number
of provisions that only a qualified individual may
purchase the policy, but I gather there is no provision
that you can point to that says that directly.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It's -- well, that's what
qualified means, Justice Alito.  It means that, you
know, if you're not qualified, you're unqualified.  And
so, I mean, that's what it means.  And so you're just
reading the word "qualified" out of the statute if you
read it that way.
JUSTICE ALITO:  "Qualified" is used in
the -- in the lay sense of the term, it's not a
technical term here.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I -- I think --
well, given the way it's defined, it's defined as a
person who resides in the State.  It excludes people out
of State.  It does that because the statute was quite
clear that you weren't going to be allowed to shop for
insurance policies across State lines because that would
infringe on traditional State prerogatives regulating
insurance.  And it -- and with respect to prisoners, it
doesn't make any sense to say that prisoners should be
able to get insurance.  Mr. Carvin says, yes, it does
because they get out of prison.  Well, there's a
specific statutory provision that says when you face a
changed-life circumstance, such as getting out of
prison, you can sign up for insurance at that point.  He
makes the point about unlawfully present persons being
both unqualified and not being able to be covered, but
that's not -- that's not surplus, that's there for a
very important reason, which is that someone can be in
lawful status and, therefore, be eligible for health
care, but then lose lawful status and at that point,
they can no longer be covered.  So, just none of that
works for them.  None of that works for them.
And -- but to -- really, to get to the
fundamental point here that both at the level of text,
you have clear irresolvable conflicts so that the
statute can't work if you read it Mr. Carvin's way.  You
have, at the level of text --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is -- is that a synonym
for ambiguity?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think so, exactly
right, Justice Scalia -- I mean, excuse me, Justice
Kennedy -- that -- that you have ambiguity there
precisely because you have to -- you know, this is a
statute that's going to operate one way or the other.
And the question is how it's going to operate.  And when
you read it their way, you --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if it's -- if it's
ambiguous, then we think about Chevron.  But it seems to
me a drastic step for us to say that the Department of
Internal Revenue and its director can make this call one
way or the other when there are, what, billions of
dollars of subsidies involved here?  Hundreds of
millions?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, there are billions
of dollars of subsidies involved here.  But two points
about that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it -- it seems to me
our cases say that if the Internal Revenue Service is
going to allow deductions using these, that it has to be
very, very clear.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it -- it seems to me a
little odd that the director of Internal Revenue
didn't -- didn't identify this problem if it's ambiguous
and advise Congress it was.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So a few points about
that with respect to Chevron deference.  First, we do
think Chevron deference clearly supports the government
here and I'll explain why.  But before you get to that,
you can resolve and should resolve this statute and the
statute's meaning in our favor even without resort to
Chevron deference.  That's what the canon of reading a
statute as a whole to make it work harmoniously directs
you to do.  It's what the very important principles of
Federalism that we've been describing here direct you to
do.  If you think there's a constitutional problem with
the statute, it's what the doctrine of constitutional
avoidance directs you to do.
Now, with respect to Chevron, Section 36B(g)
of the statute expressly delegates to the IRS the
specific authority to make any decisions necessary to
implement Section 36B.  So you don't have any ambiguity.
Congress said the IRS should do this.  It is a big
question, but as the Court said in City of Arlington two
terms ago, Chevron applies to big questions as well as
small. That Your Honor raised this point about the need for
clarity in -- in a tax deduction and IRS in the
statutory reading of tax deductions, there is a learned
treatise that describes that as a false notion.  And it
is certainly not consistent with this Court's unanimous
decision in Mayo two terms ago that Chevron applies to
the tax code like anything else.  And so --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you're right --
if you're right about Chevron, that would indicate that
a subsequent administration could change that
interpretation?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think a subsequent
administration would need a very strong case under step
two of the Chevron analysis that that was a reasonable
judgment in view of the disruptive consequences.  So as
I said, I think you can resolve and should resolve this
case because the statute really has to be read when
taken as a whole to adopt the government's position.
But I do take --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  General --
JUSTICE ALITO:  If there are any -- if there
are any tax attorneys in the -- in the courtroom today,
I think probably they wrote down what you just said. And
when we get future tax cases, the United States is going
to argue that we should not read them to -- you know,
there should be no presumption that a tax credit is
provided by that statute.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  You should -- you should
read it according to its terms.  And when you read this
provision according to its terms and you read it in
context and you read it against the background
principles of Federalism, you have to affirm the
government's interpretation.  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.
Four minutes, Mr. Carvin.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CARVIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Very quickly on standing.  Mr. Hurst would
be subject to a penalty absent relief by this Court for
2014.  As I've discussed, both he and Mrs. Leevy, of
course, would face the same principle for 2015.  If the
government is suggesting that their case has become moot
because of changed circumstances, under Cardinal
Chemical 508 U.S. (8)(3), it's their burden to raise it, not
ours to supplement the record.
In terms of the anomaly, in terms of all the
States losing -- 34 States losing their Medicaid funds,
the Solicitor General greatly distorted the statute.
It's printed at 64A of their exhibit.  It says, "a State
shall establish procedures," so the notion that HHS
established them is obviously contrary to that.  It
says, "the State will identify people to enroll on their
Exchanges."  Well, they can't enroll anybody on their
Exchanges if there are no such Exchanges in the State.
Therefore, by the plain language, if you
adopt the notion that "Exchange established by the
State" means established by HHS, all of them need to
lose their Medicaid funding.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I follow up on
something the General ended with, which -- and Justice
Kennedy referred to, which is the need to read subsidies
limited.  But so is -- in a limited way.  But so is the
need to ensure that exemptions from tax liability are
read in a limited way.  And under your reading, we're
giving more exemptions to employers not to provide
insurance, more exemptions to States and others or to
individuals, how -- how does that work?  I mean, you've
got two competing --
MR. CARVIN:  No, no.  You do get more
exemptions for employers under our reading, but -- and
the same principle applies.  Is it unambiguous?  It's
undisputed that that one is unambiguous.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well --
MR. CARVIN:  The dispute here is whether or
not if they win under ambiguity, and they don't because
the canon requires unambiguous statutes not to afford
the tax credit.  In terms of the employer mandate, I
think that's very helpful in terms of Justice Kennedy's
concern about Federalism.  Under their view of the
statute, the Federal government gets to unilaterally
impose on States -- there's an amicus from Indiana
describing this -- a requirement that States insure
their own individuals.  It implies the employer mandate
to States.  So their -- under their theory, the States
are absolutely helpless to stop this Federal
intervention into their most basic personnel practices.
Whereas under our theory, they are able to say, no.  So
actually, the more intrusive view of the statute is
theirs.
In terms of the funding condition, head on,
Your Honor, I think my short answer is as follows:
There's no way to view this statute as more coercive or
harmful than the Medicaid -- version of Medicaid that
was approved by this Court in NFIB and, indeed, the NFIB
dissenting opinion pointed to this provision as
something that was an acceptable noncoercive
alternative.  But in all events, even if there's a
constitutional doubt under a novel constitutional
question, as Justice Scalia pointed out, there's no
alternative reading of the statute that -- that avoids
that, because either way, you're intruding on State
sovereignty.
In terms of the anomaly, in terms of
qualified individuals, as predicted, Solicitor General
did not come up here and tell you, yes, if we prevail
here under this theory, they're going to have to empty
out the HHS Exchanges.  Nor did he even respond to my
argument that with respect to an Exchange under the
definitional section only applies to State Exchanges.
So I think we can view this as -- as a complete
tendentious litigation position and not a serious
statutory interpretation.
In terms of the qualified health plan that
he discussed with you, Justice Alito, the complete
answer to that is that is in 1311.
1311 only is talking about State established
Exchanges.  It has no application to HHS Exchanges,
therefore, it can't possibly create an anomaly with
respect to those HHS Exchanges.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
