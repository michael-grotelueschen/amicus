CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear
argument next in Case 08-970, Perdue v. Kenny A.
Counsel.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK H. COHEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. COHEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Plaintiff's counsel in this case earned a
large fee award based on prevailing market hourly rates
and a substantial number of hours expended.
However, the district court determined that
the $6 million lodestar was insufficient to compensate
them for the quality of their representation or their
results obtained.
This Court has previously held that factors,
such as novelty and complexity of the issues,
contingency, and superior performance cannot be used to
increase the lodestar amount because the factors are
subsumed within that determination.
But because of this Court's indication that,
in rare or exceptional circumstances, upward adjustments
may be permissible, district courts, such as the one
below, have used quality and results to increase
lodestar awards, even though the -- the multiplication
of the reasonable number of hours expended times the
reasonable hourly rate constitutes a fully compensatory
fee and serves the purpose of the statute, which is to
attract competent counsel without providing a windfall.
Now, with respect to quality of
representation, that normally involves two factors:
the skill and experience of the attorney, and also the
effort it takes to succeed in the case.
In this case, the lead counsel submitted
affidavits indicating that they sought hourly rates that
were within the prevailing market rates in the Atlanta
market; and, in fact, lead counsel's market rate, the
court found, was at the upper end of that market.
When the district court determined --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Could you
repeat what the market was? Was it the market for all
attorneys or only for attorneys doing this type of work?
MR. COHEN: It was the market for attorneys
with similar skill or experience doing similar work as
these counsel did. So what the court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What is similar -- what is
similar work?
MR. COHEN: Similar work would be Federal
court work, where you -- involving class actions, for
example. But the focus is mostly on the skill and
experience and reputation of the attorney.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.
MR. COHEN: What the court did in this case,
though, was, rather than take those hourly rates, which
were prevailing, which the record was clear were
prevailing, the court determined the quality factor
justified an increase because they advanced case
expenses, because they were not paid on an ongoing
basis, and because their fees were contingent upon the
success of the case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that has nothing to
do with the -- with the quality of the representation,
does it?
MR. COHEN: No, it doesn't, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't it name those
factors as -- as the determinative factors, instead of
saying, and therefore they should get more money for
quality?
MR. COHEN: Well, for whatever reason, the
court determined to use contingency-related factors to
increase the fee award based on the quality factor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. They advanced --
they advanced money for experts --
MR. COHEN: Correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- during the case. The
contingency, which we rejected as a -- as a basis.
And what was the third one?
MR. COHEN: And the third one was that they
weren't paid on an ongoing basis.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They weren't paid on --
MR. COHEN: That's right. But that is not
a rare --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that -- isn't that
the same as contingency?
MR. COHEN: Yes, it is, Your Honor, and it's
not a rare or exceptional circumstance when you're
talking about a fee-shifting statute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cohen, I thought this
judge, Judge Shoob, said: These lawyers were amazingly
good; I have never seen a better performance. So don't
we take him at his word? I mean, he certainly talked
about the quality of the performance of these lawyers.
MR. COHEN: He did say that they exhibited
the best skill and professionalism, Justice Ginsburg,
that he had seen in his time on the bench.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. COHEN: But I would submit to you that
that is not a reason to enhance the lodestar because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about you get a
second-year associate whose billing rate for 2 years
of experience is $200, and a partner's rate is $500, and
a judge says: This individual didn't perform like a
-year associate; he did the quality and kind of work of
someone far superior in years in skill and experience.
That would not, under your argument, entitle
the court to give an enhancement?
MR. COHEN: No, it wouldn't, Your Honor,
because, if that $200-an-hour associate was doing other
work for other clients, the bill would be for $200 an
hour, regardless of what the result would have been or
how good that associate would have been.
It's basically --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cohen, you said in
your brief that, in such a case, the prevailing party
could argue that counsel should obtain a higher hourly
rate in the litigation than the customary rate he or she
charges in other cases, and that's the situation Justice
Sotomayor inquired about.
But that sounds to me -- you take the
second-year associate, pay him at the rate of the top
partner because her performance was so outstanding.
That’s an enhancement, but it isn't as transparent as
the one that Judge Shoob gave.
But you -- this suggestion -- maybe you are
going to retreat from it -- that it would be appropriate
to take the second-year associate and pay at a higher
hourly rate than the customary rate for that associate.
MR. COHEN: What I meant by that position in
the brief, Your Honor, was that, in presenting
affidavits to support the hourly rate of that associate,
that associate may present hourly affidavits that the
rate was between $200 and $300 per hour, and the judge
could determine, because of how good he did, I'm going
to give him at the upper end of that market. And --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you haven't dealt
with my hypothetical. He didn't perform like a
second-year associate. He performed like a 15-year
lawyer. The difference is not with respect to skill and
experience. It's with respect to performance.
And so what Justice Ginsburg was asking is,
what you are basically saying, the quality of that
representation, even though it reflected more than the
market one would look at objectively on the basis of the
years of experience, that judge can't enhance, even
though someone performed far above whatever else the
market would consider his or her skills at the moment.
MR. COHEN: Well, remember, Your Honor,
that, when the statute was enacted, it was said in the
congressional reports that they wanted to compensate for
the expenditure of time and to reimburse the plaintiff,
if you will, for what the plaintiff put out in terms of
expenses and fees.
Well, if you are -- if you are going to
basically treat that second-year associate as a 15-year
partner and award him a $500-an-hour rate, what you are
actually doing is overcompensating that person for what
the expenditure of time was and for what the actual fee
they would have charged to their client was.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose the
question under the statute is whether it would be a
reasonable attorney's fee, and I guess one way to
determine that is to ask whether it would be considered
reasonable if a law firm that billed a client according
to their regular hourly rates came in and said, but
we're going to kick it up another -- you know, another
$10,000 because this -- this second-year associate, boy,
he's a whiz, and he performed like a senior partner. So
we are going to -- we are billing him at the $500 rate,
instead of the $200. Would -- would that be considered
a reasonable attorney's fee?
MR. COHEN: No, it wouldn't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn’t think so.
MR. COHEN: -- and no reasonable law firm
would do that, which is why a judge would be beyond his
discretion -- or her discretion --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not true. Law
firms get bonuses from clients all the time. They get
negotiated. Some of the amici gave examples of what's
happening in the -- what happens in the marketplace.
MR. COHEN: But those are private agreements
that are entered into with a client.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't the judge
determine a reasonable fee in the same way the market
does? Which is --
MR. COHEN: That's not the -- I'm sorry.
That’s not the traditional market, Your Honor. The
traditional market is the hourly rate that’s envisioned
by the lodestar. We don't replicate all possible
private fee agreements into fee-shifting statutes.
That's what this Court has said.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but the -- but the
Congress didn't use the per-hour lodestar --
MR. COHEN: No.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- as the method. If
that's all it wanted, it could have, and there were
suggestions that it consider limiting the -- the award
to just a lodestar calculation. So obviously Congress
was thinking of something broader than just that.
MR. COHEN: Well, Congress was --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That part of the market
anyway.
MR. COHEN: I'm sorry.
Congress also was not thinking of
replicating all possible private fee arrangements
because they also indicated that the -- the amount of
the fee should not be dependent on a proportion of the
damage award.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's why we
have held in our cases that it should be a rare and
exceptional circumstance. The difference that we are
engaged in is whether the quality of performance can
ever constitute that rare exception that would justify a
district court saying, you performed greater than what
the market would have valued you at before your
performance. That's really what the issue is.
MR. COHEN: Well, that's -- in answer to
your hypothetical, again, in the market where you have
an hourly rate for an associate, that’s the hourly rate
that that client is going to be billed by that law firm,
and they are not going to have a results fee or a bonus
fee because that attorney happened to do better. The
hourly rates --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, this --
this brilliant second-year associate we are talking
about, the way these submissions to the Court are -- the
way they're presented, do they carve out her
contribution to a particular filing? To the extent I
have looked at them they have something like, you know,
draft motion to dismiss, and the associate has 40 hours
and the junior partner has 10 hours and the senior
partner has 5 hours dedicated to that.
I mean, if the associate is doing -- in the
hypothetical, is doing work at the partner level, how do
you know that the brilliance isn't contributed by the 4
hours of the partner rather than the 40 hours of the
associate?
MR. COHEN: You don't in the traditional way
of billing that you are talking about, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Or, indeed, you don't know
that the brilliance of the second-year associate enables
the $500-an-hour partner to spend less time on the
matter. Presumably it does. It's so great when it
comes to him, he doesn't have to do much work.
MR. COHEN: Well, that's true, Your Honor.
The other thing to point out is that when the
submissions are made to the court, they are supposed to
be broken down by tasks actually. And here the district
court considered the submissions not by what lawyer did
what task, but how many hours were expended on
individual tasks.
And when the court determined to actually
lower the amount because of excessive hours, they looked
at tasks and said, for summary judgment, for example,
too many hours were expended. So they -- the court
doesn't normally look at lawyer doing particular tasks.
It looks at tasks being done by the lawyers in general.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It is not clear to
me what the district judge should do in making the
lodestar calculation when he considers quality of
performance. I guess you are saying -- I think maybe
you have already said -- that he can consider quality
of performance, but only within the confines of what is
a reasonable rate.
MR. COHEN: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because the brief for the
Respondent said: Well, you know, you are really
counting this at the front end, and if you can do that,
why not put it in at the back end? And I'm just having
problems with that still. Suppose the judge at the
outset said: This quality of performance is so good
that, so far as the lodestar is concerned, I think a
reasonable fee is above the usual hourly rate.
MR. COHEN: Well, I would submit, though,
that when the judge decides how to do the lodestar rate,
he is looking at the affidavits, talking about what the
range of the market is for that area. He's also looking
at the number of hours reasonably expended.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- so that in
computing the lodestar rate, he cannot consider quality
of performance?
MR. COHEN: Quality of performance is built
within, I would say subsumed within, the hourly rate and
the number of hours expended, as this Court has said in
Delaware Valley I.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then it seems to me
you're saying that he does not look to actual quality of
performance. He just looks to market rates without
reference to that. I -- I --
MR. COHEN: Well, but --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why I'm having --
I'm -- I mean, you know, the -- the question presented
is -- is just quality of performance and results
obtained; that's all we're talking about.
MR. COHEN: Correct. And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't see why that
can't be considered as part of the lodestar, and if it
can be, then I don't see what the argument is about.
MR. COHEN: But superior performance is just
the reason that hourly rates are what they are. That's
what this Court said in Pierce v. Underwood.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not necessarily –-
JUSTICE STEVENS: But does that -- does that
mean that the fee would be the same under the lodestar
whether the lawyer won or lost?
MR. COHEN: Well, no. The -- the lawyer
doesn't get a fee in a fee-shifting statute if he loses.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But if for some reason, if
-- if you did had some reason to calculate it,
theoretically it would be the same fee as if he had
lost?
MR. COHEN: That's correct. That's correct.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And so the quality of
performance really is totally irrelevant.
MR. COHEN: As it is for the normal lawyer
working on a private matter for a client.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.
MR. COHEN: They get paid an hourly rate and
it's win or lose. And what the judge tried to do here
is to say, well, I need to give them a little extra
because their winning this case was dependent upon a
contingency, and the factors that he built into that
enhancement were contingency-related factors.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we are going back to
the judge, who did say that this was the best
performance he ever saw. So I can't credit just that it
was just contingency.
But, first, you have clarified that what you
said in your brief meant only the top range for a lawyer
of this, period. So this is more limited than -- than
one might take it to be.
In some circuits, like the D.C. Circuit, the
rate is set by the number of years that the person is
out of law school, and there isn't any flexibility. I
mean, you give the 1-year associate so much, the 5-year
associate so much. So how in a system like that could
you take into account quality at all?
MR. COHEN: Well, but in the normal system,
Your Honor -- and I would ask to reserve some time for
rebuttal -- that that hourly rate that that first-year
or second-year associate gets is the rate that they bill
their clients. They don't adjust it afterwards unless
they have a special fee arrangement, as -- as Justice
Sotomayor said. They don't adjust it when they send the
final bill and they say: This associate is the best --
did the best work that you have ever seen, and we're
going to increase that hourly rate exponentially because
of that work. That's not the market with respect to
billable rates.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. COHEN: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Shah.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Section 1988 permits reasonable attorney's
fees. That means going above and beyond the lodestar
amount can be justified only if the lodestar is
unreasonably low. We submit that a lodestar based on
prevailing market rates does not require a performance
bonus on top of the lodestar to make an award
reasonable.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You are saying we can never
exceed the lodestar amount? I mean, we have said in
some cases that in extraordinary circumstances it can.
What are those extraordinary circumstances, or do you
think there are none?
MR. SHAH: There are none for attorney
performance, Your Honor. There may be other
circumstances --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Such as? That's what I'm
asking.
MR. SHAH: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What are you referring to,
if not attorney performance?
MR. SHAH: Right. The government sets out
one example in our brief of where we think an upward
enhancement might be appropriate, and that’s where an
attorney takes on a particularly unpopular client or
cause that causes some external harm, external to the
case, to his practice or income, where --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's one of the
long-standing traditions of the bar that lawyers are
expected to do that in the normal course. So why would
that be a special circumstance?
MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I think that
circumstance is much more closely tied to the statutory
purpose of section 1988, which is to attract competent
counsel in this subset of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you
tell -- how do you tell whether a client is popular or
unpopular? I mean, a lot of unpopular clients in the
abstract sense are in fact -- they have a lot of support
in the community. I suppose one of the more unpopular
clients these days is a Wall Street banker.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I mean, you
wouldn't say -- you wouldn't suggest that law firms
charge more when they represent them?
MR. SHAH: No, Your Honor. I think what our
-- what our enhancement would allow for, even if you
can't make the ex ante determination that taking on this
representation is going to cause me some special harm;
that is, all my clients will leave my firm if I take on
this case -- even if you don't know that before the
fact, the fact that there is an ability for the court to
give you an enhancement when that occurs -- remember,
this is done after -- after the case is already complete
is when the -- fee hearing determination is made. The
ability of a court to give that sort of compensation
would provide an insurance, a guarantee to the attorney
before they take on a case that if it turns out badly
that -- that they will still get compensated.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that’s what we
had in mind, huh? You think that’s what we had in mind
when we said they are extraordinary circumstances?
MR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's very
imaginative, but I would never --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- but I would never have
thought of it, and I doubt whether we did.
(Laughter.)
MR. SHAH: Well, it is -- Your Honor, it is
one of the 10 -- one of the Johnson factors set forth,
so it's not coming out of thin air. And I think it
is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- is there another
example? I mean, you -- you are saying the rule isn't
never; it is sometimes. And you have given us one
sometime. Is there any other illustration?
MR. SHAH: Your Honor, that is the only one
that I think is left after this Court's fee-setting
jurisprudence over the last 25 years. It has
consistently knocked down other bases for an enhancement
such as complexity of issues, novelty of issues,
contingency risk, delayed payment. All of those other
grounds of potential enhancement that the legislative
history refers to have been categorically prohibited by
this Court's jurisprudence. I think that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about a downward
adjustment? You have the hourly rate, the number of
hours, and the judge, after trimming the hours, then
says: This has been a case, even though they prevailed,
the lawyer wasn't prepared; I am not going to give the
hourly rate. Can a judge adjust the lodestar down for
poor performance?
MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I think the limited
circumstances which allow for a downward adjustment
would be those set forth in this Court's decision in
Hensley. I don't think that poor performance alone
would justify a downward departure --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Hensley is you lost on an
issue, so you don't get paid for what you’ve done.
MR. SHAH: Right. So if there were certain
claims that the poor performance led -- led the
plaintiff to be unsuccessful on certain claims but not
all the claims, I think a downward departure would be
appropriate.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the plaintiff -- the
plaintiff prevailed on everything. It’s just that the
judge said this was a really poor -- poor performance.
MR. SHAH: No, Your Honor, I don't think a
downward departure would be appropriate in that
circumstance, because that's what the -- the
prevailing market would not allow for a downward
departure. Normally, these are standard --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if the judge found as
a fact that this lawyer spent 50 hours doing what any
good lawyer could do in 5 hours?
MR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, that
would be taken care of in the setting of the lodestar
rate. Remember, there are two components --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't -- I don't see how
that is set forth in the lodestar rate.
MR. SHAH: Well, it -- not in the lodestar
rate, but in the number of reasonable -- there are two
components to the lodestar calculation: the number of –-
number of hours reasonably spent on the matter and the
reasonable hourly rate.
The situation you posit would be addressed
by a downward adjustment of the number of hours
reasonably spent working on the case. If the judge made
a determination that any competent lawyer could have
done this in 10 hours, he would not credit 50 hours of
work. And that's -- that's how that situation would be
taken care of.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: For extraordinary
circumstances, what about a very, very popular cause and
he wins and they are beating his door down? Can we
reduce it for that?
(Laughter.)
MR. SHAH: No, Your Honor, that would not
require a reduction. That would be an extra award for
the attorney taking on that type of -- of case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, what is sauce
for the goose is sauce for the gander.
(Laughter.)
JUDGE SCALIA: I mean, if -- if you get
rewarded for unpopularity, you ought to be get penalized
for popularity.
(Laughter.)
JUDGE SCALIA: You got a lot more clients
because of this case.
MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I don't think
there is any basis in the -- in the private market for
that sort of downward adjustment.
Justice Sotomayor, if I can address your
concern about these alternative arrangements that --
that occur in -- that are starting to emerge -- at least
Respondents suggest in their brief to this Court by
citing a few newspaper articles and the proverbial word
on the street that these are an emerging trend.
First of all, there’s no -- absolutely no
evidence in the record in this case that those type of
arrangements were available in the relevant market. But
even if they were, those sort of alternative
arrangements are essentially modified contingency
arrangements. And this is made most clear in
Respondents' own amicus brief, the brief of the law and
economic scholars. And this is at page 10 and 11 of
their brief.
They call these partial contingency or
hybrid contingency arrangements. It's not the same
standard hourly rate and then a client decides to throw
in a kicker of a million dollar bonus. Rather, these
are discounted rates with a success bonus, essentially a
modified form of contingency arrangement. They are
prohibited for exactly the same reason that this Court
prohibited a contingency risk enhancement in Dague. The
same reasons would prohibit relying on those sort of
alternative arrangements to provide an attorney
enhancement for performance.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: One of the purposes of
Congress -- one of the purposes of Congress was to
ensure that litigants under these fee-shifting statutes
could attract competent counsel, correct?
MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the market doesn't
give them attorneys to start with because there are so
many risks involved in this process and it sets a
reduced fee because of those risks, how do you attract
competent counsel? How do you attract counsel that is
better than the norm in that field to pursue as private
attorney generals cases that Congress has determined are
worthy of being pursued, unless you have a quality
adjustment factor?
MR. SHAH: Two responses, Your Honor:
First, the problem that you posit about attorneys
having -- being deterred by having to absorb, you know,
the -- the upfront outlay of significant expert expenses
or to having absorbed the contingency risks, those are
problems created by this Court's precedent in Dague, not
before this Court now.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't mean Dague
was right, right?
MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, no one has
asked --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No one is arguing a
different point?
MR. SHAH: No one in this case has asked the
Court to revisit Dague.
But more -- more to the point of your
question, the type -- even accepting Respondents'
formulation of this enhancement, it would only be
available in the rare and exceptional case. And no
reasonable attorney making an ex ante determination to
whether to take on a representation would rely on the
speculative and remote possibility that the district
judge is going to have found this to be one of the best
cases he has ever seen in making that calculation.
Respondents' own numbers suggest that these
are granted less than one time -- once a year. That
suggests that no reasonable attorney would take that
into consideration, and it does not, in fact, further
the statutory purpose in that event of attracting
competent counsel.
I would like to make one last point, and
this is to bring us back to the facts of this case. I
think Respondents' own trial counsel -- the discussion
that they give of the lodestar rates used in this case I
think is particularly telling. And this is the
affidavit of Marcia Lowry, who was the lead plaintiff’s
trial counsel, and this was submitted during the fee-
setting hearing, and the relevant excerpt appears on
page 41 of the Joint Appendix. And I want to read from
paragraph 25, and here's what she has to say about the
rates used by the court:
"The standard hourly rates reflected in
Exhibit 2" -- and those are the rates used by the
district court -- "are fair, reasonable and consistent
with the hourly rates in the Atlanta market for the
price of legal services of comparable quality rendered
in cases demanding similar skill, judgment, and
performance."
Now, the affidavit goes on to say that the
rates are still too low for the other factors that
Mr. Cohen discussed -- contingency risk, delayed
payment, expert fees -- but not for attorney
performance.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. SHAH: Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Clement.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Let me begin with the colloquy that involved
Justices Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy about the rates
and whether you can have sort of pre-enhanced rates as
part of the lodestar or whether you can only do the
enhancement after the fact.
At the end of the day, as long as it is
established in this case that you can have an
enhancement for quality, I suppose that my -- my clients
would be satisfied. The point is, though, that the
preexisting law in the Eleventh Circuit and most
circuits does not allow for a pre-enhanced rate to be
used to calculate the lodestar. They are either done
completely mechanically, as Justice Ginsburg suggests --
the Laffey index in the D.C. Circuit -- or they are done
through a simple calculation of the prevailing market
rates.
JUSTICE ALITO: But sometimes there’s a
great advantage in doing things mechanically, because
it -- it provides an element of fairness. And I’ll
tell you what troubles me about this, and maybe you can
convince me that I shouldn't be troubled by it. Here
the district judge in effect takes four plus million
dollars from the taxpayers of Georgia and -- and awards
it above the lodestar calculation to these attorneys and
says -- and I -- I certainly take him at his word --
this was the best performance I have seen in 28 years.
But it seems totally standardless, and I see no way of
policing it, and I see a great danger that trial judges
are going to use this as a way of favoring their
favorite nonprofit foundation or their favorite cause or
their favorite attorneys, because they think they
generally do good work.
And this is not -- this is not like private
litigation where the money is coming out of the pocket
of a corporation. It's coming out of the pocket of
taxpayers. So that is very troubling. And I don't know
how you can provide standards for determining whether
this kind of transfer is based on anything reasonable.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, let me
say that I don't think that you need any more standards
for the possibility of an upward departure than you need
for the possibility of a downward departure. And this
Court has already held in Farrar v. Hobby that the
results obtained is an adequate basis for departure, and
not a small departure. In Farrar v. Hobby, the lodestar
amount, the mechanical calculation that we're talking
about, was $280,000. What was the reasonable attorney's
fee? This Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but wait. That's
pretty objective: results obtained. I mean, if, you
know, the -- what was sought in the complaint was 100,
and in fact you got only 30, you are still a prevailing
party, but you shouldn't -- you shouldn't be compensated
as though you got everything that was sought. I think
that's much more objective than whether -- whether this
attorney is the best one I've seen in 28 years.
I have another problem with it. I don't
like judges -- it's certainly not in the tradition of
the bench to comment upon the performance of lawyers. I
can't tell you how often I would like to give a separate
grade for --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for the lawyer who won a
case. You know, one grade for the case and the other
for the lawyer. But we don't do that.
And if you do this going up, you've got to
do it going down. And you could expect the judge to
say: This is the worst performance I have seen in
years. Judges don't do that in our system, and I
don't think -- I don't think we should set up a
mechanism that induces them to do it.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, two things, Your Honor.
I mean, the results obtained is one of the two factors
that are at issue in this case. And I think results
obtained can be objective and be a basis for an upward
adjustment as well as a downward adjustment.
As you heard the lawyer in the earlier case
say, you know, in a complaint, it is a wish list. And
it's a rare case where the attorney gets everything they
ask for in the complaint. This is that rare case where
everything that was asked for in the complaint was
obtained. So that's one factor, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I will let you
answer your second point, but just on that, I don't
understand the concept of extraordinary success or
results obtained. The results that are obtained are
presumably the results that are dictated or command or
required under the law. And it's not like, well, you
had a really good attorney, so I'm going to say the law
means this, which gives you a lot more, but if you had a
bad attorney I would say the law has this and so he
doesn't get a multiplier.
The results obtained under our theory should
be what the law requires, and not different results
because you have different lawyers.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I
mean, I defer to you, but I'm not sure that comports
with my experience. I have seen lawyers come into this
Court and concede a point in oral argument, and I have
seen that prominently featured in this Court's opinion,
so it does seem to me that sometimes the quality of the
performance and the results obtained do depend on the
lawyer's performance and are not foreordained just by
the four corners of the complaint.
And so I think, again --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but what does
a judge say when he said, you have achieved
extraordinary results? That if you weren't there, I
would have made a mistake on the law?
MR. CLEMENT: No, I think what he says is,
in the hands of another counsel, the relief that was
obtained might have been significantly less. This was
an enormous --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess that's
saying the same thing I said, which if it weren't for
--
how good you are, I would have made a mistake.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, maybe not -- no, not how
good. How tenacious. I mean, this case settled. With
a different lawyer for the plaintiffs in this case than
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe we have a
different perspective. You think the lawyers are
responsible for a good result, and I think the judges
are.
(Laughter.)
MR. CLEMENT: And maybe your perspective's
changed, Your Honor.
(Laughter.)
MR. CLEMENT: But I would say certainly in
the context of a consent decree, when to give up, when
to fight further, is going to be factored into the
results. And I think it's a fair point that a judge in
today's system, especially in the context of class
relief like this, sees a lot of cases that end up with a
coupon settlement that really doesn't do any good for
the class. They're --
JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe -- maybe your
perspective has changed too, Mr. Clement.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO: But your argument is that,
you know, for $495 an hour you really can't get a good
lawyer? You need to have -- you need to pay more than
that?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, on that my perspective
has changed, Your Honor.
(Laughter.)
MR. CLEMENT: But let me say two things:
One is, less than 10 percent of the total
rates here, the total compensable hours here, were
top-of-the-market rates. Only the two lead counsel were
compensated, at sort of $495 and $450 an hour.
If you want to talk about the -- the Lowry
declaration, which is one thing that Mr. Shah brought
up, what he quoted from was essentially the conclusion
of that, where as part of the existing Eleventh Circuit
precedent that looks to prevailing rates in the Atlanta
market, there is a recitation that that is the sort of
the prevailing rate consistent with the quality. That’s
essentially something that the Eleventh Circuit
requires you to say.
I think the more relevant part of that
declaration is at Joint Appendix at page 35, where
Ms. Lowry points out that as a matter of fact these
rates in the Atlanta market do nothing to account for
the fact that she has to pay New York overhead, and that
her real rates are a national rate based on providing a
service that almost no one else in the country can
provide. This is really a unique --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is the overhead?
MR. CLEMENT: What's that?
JUSTICE BREYER: What is the overhead? I
mean, that's something that I find interesting and
important, and I can't find it anywhere. The numbers
began to bother me in the same way they did with Justice
Alito. I’m thinking: There are 30,000 hours. They
got 10.5 million. That translates into, what is it,
$350 an hour. Now, if the lawyer works for 2,000 hours
of the year, which is a little high, he is being
compensated at $700,000 on average in this case. But he
has to pay overhead. So what's that? 40 percent? 30?
MR. CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, the numbers
aren't broken down. But I can tell you --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, if you have
any rough idea at all, because I think if it's anywhere
near $700,000 on average, you say to a taxpayer: You
are going to pay this, and that's more money than 99
percent of the taxpayers hope to see in their lives, and
suddenly they are paying that money to somebody, which
is -- I could say: Okay, pay them 400,000. That's
what he would get as the average fee for the toppest,
most top lawyer. And that's, you know, pretty high.
And -- but $700,000 a year for a lawyer. Wow. And
that's what this judge paid.
Now, what is it that came out of that?
That's what I want to know before I make up my mind,
frankly. And I'm going to try to look it up, but I'm
trying -- I'm trying to get a rough idea here.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, what I think you can say
for sure, Justice Breyer, is that what came out of that
is a lot more if you have your office in New York --
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I know, but --
MR. CLEMENT: -- than if you have your office
in Atlanta.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- that doesn't help me,
and the reason it doesn't help me is because if it's a
very, very high number in dollars per year, then I am
tempted to think: Well, very high is enough. You don't
need very, very, very high.
You see my point?
MR. CLEMENT: I do, Justice Breyer, but I
also think the question presented here is whether you
can ever have an enhancement.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. I would be saying:
Be satisfied forever with very, very high, the most top
pay that any top lawyer gets; do not want even more than
that.
And if in fact I doubt that I have really
made a difference to incentives on that one, for the
reason that the Solicitor General said -- and my
goodness, how do we explain this to the average person?
That -- those are the questions that are genuinely going
through my mind. I haven't made up my mind how I will
come out in this case. So it's not a kind of putting
this to you. I don't know.
MR. CLEMENT: Right. Well, Justice Breyer,
let me take issue, though, with the hypothetical that
all these lawyers are getting the top, top rate. That's
not -- that's not what is happening, either in this case
or in general.
And one of the things, if you look out at
the circuits, you will see that, because this Court has
always said that the lodestar method is a two-step
process, the first step, as this Court has repeatedly
described it, is an estimate. Because of that, the
circuits have some looseness as to how they go about
estimating the reasonable hourly rate. They do not say:
Let's take the tippy-tip-top rate and use that to
calculate the rate. They use a variety of formulas. As
I say, the Laffey index in the D.C. Circuit is quite
formulistic and doesn't -- it puts you in three-year
groups and doesn't change your compensation between your
th and 11th year and your 12th and 20th year, so it's
very mechanical. In some circuits, you can get a
national rate. So in a circuit -- if this case would
have been litigated in Cincinnati in the Sixth Circuit,
then Ms. Lowry may have been able to get $700 an hour,
which is a national rate. On the other hand, because
this was in Atlanta, she was able to get the prevailing
market rate in Atlanta, which was 495. Now --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, this lawyer
-- I'm sorry, this judge said they were extraordinarily
good, but, I mean, where's the cutoff? If the judge
said, this is in the top 10 lawyers I’ve ever seen, or
the top 20, where do you get an enhancement and where do
you not?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, that's the
thing. It's hard to tell.
MR. CLEMENT: No, no. But I don't mean to
-- I would start with this Court's cases that say it is
to be in a rare case. Now, they say that repeatedly, so
I take this Court at its word, and I would think that
the rare case might --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, for
years -- the judge was on the bench 28 years, right?
Well, if you are in the top 28, is that a
rare case or not? It's once a year.
MR. CLEMENT: Well -- but he had one case in
years, so, I mean, whatever the denominator is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but we are
trying --
MR. CLEMENT: -- it's a huge denominator,
and this --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are trying to
establish a principle, and other judges are going to
have to follow this. And do they think, well, this was
really good, but it wasn't as good as that law firm or
lawyers we had 3 years ago; they were really good.
MR. CLEMENT: I mean, actually, I don't
think that's a crazy way to approach it, which is this
really is supposed to be something that’s reserved for
the rare case. I am not -- I don’t want to see --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I assume -- how
long -- how does a judge, who is on the bench in his or
her first year, do this?
Well, this is the best lawyer I've had in
the eight months I have been here.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But how does he or
she know that that -- that may be as good as it gets,
for the next 28 years?
(Laughter.)
MR. CLEMENT: Well, maybe the judge stays
his or her hand in the first year. I mean, this is a
discretionary judgment. There is an element of
discretion in this, that starts with the statutory text --
which is “may,” not “must” -- and this Court has
recognized time and time again that the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You say discretion. I say
randomness. I mean, that is not a matter of discretion.
It is a matter of randomness. How -- how long has the
judge who observed this case been on the bench?
If he has been there just a couple of years,
kiss good-bye to your -- your extra money for being
excellent. That's random. That's not discretion.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, no, I think it's a –-
it’s a discretionary judgment. I mean, the –- the
district courts are going to be exercising that
discretion guided by what this Court has said.
This Court has said it should be the rare
case in which there’s an enhancement. I think they are
entitled to take this case -- this Court at its word,
and I think there’s a reason, by the way, as this Court
has rejected enhancement based on other factors, that it
has always held out the possibility for the enhancement
in the rare case, for the quality of service and the
excellence of results.
The reason is, if you take that off the
table, then the statute becomes unrecognizable to the
Congress that passed it. This is not a difficult
question about whether the Congress that passed the
statute intended for there to be bonuses or enhancements
based on exceptional quality and results.
Those of you that look to legislative
history, in this context of interpreting this statute,
have repeatedly looked to the Senate report. The Senate
report provides three exemplary cases as to how you
should correctly apply an attorney's fee.
Two of those three cases applied
enhancements based on exceptional performance and
results.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you want this Court to
look to those cases -- you know, it's the world turned
upside down. Instead of the lower courts reading our
cases, we have to read lower court cases to decide what
this statute means. Is that it?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, two -- two responses,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't do that.
MR. CLEMENT: I know you don't, and I know
that because I read your dissent -- or your
concurrence --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MR. CLEMENT: -- in Blanchard. The rest of
the Court did that in Blanchard, and I think it should
continue to do that because you are interpreting a word
like “reasonable,” and I think have you to look
somewhere, and the -- and the Senate report provides
guidance.
The second thing though is, Justice Scalia,
you, in a number of contexts, have pointed out that, if
you don't look to legislative history, it's okay to look
at how a term was interpreted by courts at the time that
Congress adopted it.
And that's another way to get at the same
result, which is, in this is case --
JUSTICE BREYER: Should I -- should I look
at the fact that, in the early 1970s, when this was
done, legal fees were not quite so high? And perhaps,
comparatively so, they weren't quite so high, either.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, I would
say that -- you know, you can look to the fact that we
have had a lot of inflation since then. You can make
the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Not just inflation. I
think the discrepancy between these top legal fees and
the fee of the average person -- or the work of the
average person, the average wage for a family of four
has changed quite a lot. I suspect that's true, but I
could look it up. But should I look it up?
MR. CLEMENT: I don't think you should
because, again, what Congress said it was trying to do
here was not to try to make people indifferent between
whether they became lawyers or not.
They were looking at lawyers and they were
trying to determine, we want to essentially make you
indifferent between engaging in civil rights work and
other complex civil litigation, like antitrust, and if
that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, this statute was
passed before we adopted the lodestar approach, wasn't
MR. CLEMENT: Before you adopted the
lodestar, sure.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Before this Court --
MR. CLEMENT: But not before the lower
courts had adopted the lodestar, and which way does that
cut?
I think that cuts very strongly against adopting a rule
that says, the lodestar is not just a guiding principle
but is an absolute ceiling on the award.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I would think it cuts
the other way. Congress was not contemplating that we
would adopt approach -- an approach which takes into
account the excellence of counsel.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, again, Your Honor, with
respect, I don't think, in any direct way, the lodestar
takes into account the quality of counsel. Prevailing
market rates, as Justice Stevens indicated, win or lose
-- those are the prevailing market rates.
So I don't think it directly takes it into
Account. And, the question here is whether you can ever
take that into account.
And I actually think, if you are looking for
guidance, you can look to the early Third Circuit cases
that were decided before Congress passed the statute,
and what those Third Circuit cases decided -- there was
an en banc case, Lindy II, by Judge Aldisert and a panel
opinion in Merola by Judge Garth.
And what those decisions did is they said
the great thing about having a lodestar with adjustments
is that, in the mine run of cases, the rates are going
to get quality of performance results about right.
But what they --
JUSTICE ALITO: But you, yourself, make the
point in your brief that the -- that legal fees are
changing. And do you think that’s relevant? Are they
going up? Or are they going down now?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think, right now, they
are sort of, at best, staying stagnant and maybe going
down a little bit. I think this Court has always looked
to the market in setting rates a bit.
I think the main thing the fact that
rates are not going up in sort of an inevitable cycle
suggests to me is that this Court has to recognize that
the one basis for enhancement that it has already
consistently recognized, which is an enhancement for
delay, which is not the same thing as contingency.
This Court recognized that enhancement for
delay was appropriate in the case of Missouri v.
Jenkins. Now, this Court indicated that you can take
account for delay, either through current rates, instead
of historical rates, or through an enhancement.
I think the one thing we know now is you
have to be careful about using current rates to take
into account for delay because the assumption that that
would work was based on this assumption that rates
inevitably go up.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is a flip side
to the unpopular case situation the S.G. talked about,
which is lawyers and law firms sometimes take on a
particular high-profile case to increase their profile,
and they would have done it for a lot less.
We have lawyers who argue here, who are
doing it for free, because it's a big deal to be
recognized as doing something in the Supreme Court. So
when you use prevailing rates with respect to that type
of work, you are overcompensating them.
MR. CLEMENT: Well -- and maybe that's
right, and maybe there should be adjustment in those
cases. Maybe you shouldn't just take the prevailing
rate for the general provision of services.
You should take into account that, actually,
you have lawyers here who are willing to do it for free.
Sometimes, I think you get what you pay for, but that's
a different subject.
(Laughter.)
MR. CLEMENT: I do think that you can make
adjustments, and that’s what is -- think about the term
“the lodestar.” I mean, the lodestar is not a
destination. It's not a complete calculation. The
lodestar is a guiding light. It gets you --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's also not
the term Congress used.
MR. CLEMENT: It's not, but if we want to
resort to what Congress had in mind, I think that only
favors the idea that you would have adjustments upward
and downward.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I want to resort to
what Congress said, which was --
MR. CLEMENT: And the term is “reasonable,”
and, again, I think, if you were looking for fertile
ground to derive a bright-line rule that you never, ever
have an enhancement for quality --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Aren't you -- most of
your arguments are suggesting that the counter -- that
your adversary is now limiting, that the adjustment
should be made -- tied to something, and that something
would be the actual rate.
And most of the factors you are talking
about -- whether the person's a national attorney with
overhead or whether that person's a -- has done better
work -- the example I used, a second-year associate,
could be adjusted just in the rate, and that would give
you a grounded place to make a judgment about the
exercise of a court's discretion. Why isn't that a more
structured, more --
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess what I would
say, Justice Sotomayor, is that that potentially could
be more structured. I'm not sure it inherently is,
which is to say I think -- you know, in some ways, it
may be more transparent to say, we are just going to use
the Laffey index, or we are going to use the prevailing
market rates, and then we are really going to hone in on
the issue of quality and exceptional results after the
fact.
I think, if the Court wants to suggest that
you should take those factors into account in setting
the rate -- and the rate should not be just a rigidly
calculated rate that comes from an index or comes from
the prevailing market -- I think the one thing I would
very much want to urge on you is, if you take that
route, that you allow a remand for an opportunity for my
clients to make that showing to the district court
because there’s no question, from the record here, that
they were responding to extant law of the Eleventh
Circuit.
And that extant law did not provide that
possibility for adjustment with the prevailing market
rates. Those were --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Cohen said that
that would be a very limited adjustment. He wasn't
contemplating in his suggestion in his brief that you
could go outside what the associate would get; you just
go to the top. Let's say it could be 200 to 400, you
give him 400, but you don't give him 500.
Justice Alito asked -- he was concerned about
standard list enhancements, so one question is when do
you enhance? Another is, in this case it was 75 percent.
How do you know what's the right multiplier?
That -- the concern is you are going to have
variations from district judge to district judge in how
good the performance was, in what is the appropriate
multiplier. Are there any handles that would prevent
this from becoming just random, just rudderless?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, first
let me say that I had understood, and perhaps this was
wishful thinking, but I had understood that Justice
Sotomayor was suggesting the possibility of a broader
inquiry at the rate-setting stage, not just a narrow
focus sort of within bands. So I just -- that's what I
was trying to respond to.
As to trying to cabin the discretion, let me
try to offer some thoughts about cabining the
discretion, but let me also say that, to paraphrase
Justice Scalia, what sauce for the goose is sauce for
the gander. I mean, this Court has said that there are
bases for downward departures, and including downward
departures all the way to zero in Farrar v. Hobby, and
the Court has not been overly concerned about cabining
that discretion.
And that kind of discretion goes on downward
all the time. It can take place in the terms of looking
at a particular motion and saying that wasn't a very
good motion; you were wasting your time. There are a
variety of ways that that can be taken into account
downward, and this Court hasn't felt that concerned
about cabining the discretion.
Now, if this Court wants to cabin the
discretion, I think certainly there’s two factors here:
There’s the quality of service and there is the
exceptional results. As to the quality of service, I
would certainly say that you ought not to have a rigid
rule, which is essentially what Petitioners are asking
for, that would cap you with prevailing market rates.
There ought to be some flexibility for that,
for the judge to take into account the actual experience
that the judge has with the lawyers in the courtroom.
The second thing I would say is that I do
think it ought to be fair, if you are going to do this
kind of calculation, that you don't base it on something
like the Laffey index, and you don't base it on a rule
that a national expert can never get a national
prevailing rate, but even though they are sitting in New
York, they have to get the top rate only in the Atlanta
market. I think those differences should be taken into
account on the compensation side of things.
And then if at some point, the judge wants
to say, and I want to give either this rate or this
multiplier for the quality of the performance, then
that's something that you can certainly assess.
As to the exceptional results, I also think
there, too, you can focus on specific factors of the
case before you, and you can say things. Now, I would
say, for example in this case, part of the reason the
results are exceptional -- I would point to at least three
things: One is the advance of capital here in order to
take on a case of this breadth and undertaking is really
an exceptional undertaking. And if you look at the
Goldberg declaration at Joint Appendix 75, that
declaration points out that a smaller firm would have
essentially been bankrupted by this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were -- were expert
witness fees reimbursable in this case, under -- under
the statute? I noticed they were cut down, but I didn't
know if he cut out all of them or just part of them.
MR. CLEMENT: The district judge cut -- cut
out all of them following this Court's decision in
Casey, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.
MR. CLEMENT: There was still, though, I
should say, something on the order of $750,000 in
reimbursable expenses that had to be advanced. It’s
worth pointing out that one factor that Judge Shoob took
into account in giving an enhancement here was the delay
in payment. That is a permissible factor under
Missouri v. Jenkins, and even if you use current rates,
that doesn't do anything to compensate you for the delay
in reimbursement of expenses.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I think it
does. I think rates are set with -- based on a law
firm's record of -- I mean, just because you bill a
client doesn't mean that they are going to pay or that
they are going to pay at what you billed them. And I
think the rates are set to take into account that over
the past year whatever you have a realization rate
of -- whatever, 80 percent or 85 percent.
MR. CLEMENT: Oh, I was just making a narrow
point, Mr. Chief Justice, which is the current rates
don't take into account the fact that there was a delay
in repayment for reimbursable expenses. Some of these
expenses were paid out 4 years ago, I mean at the
time of the fee calculation. You don't get sort of, you
know, today's copying expenses or today's FedEx
expenses. You get the expenses at the time you did
them, and you don't get any prejudgment interest on
that. So that is one thing Judge Shoob thought ought to
be compensated here.
Again, that’s one factor that makes this
exceptional. Another factor is that this was an
entrenched problem that they were dealing with. In 1989
the foster care child system in Georgia was described as
a crisis; by 1996 it had been upgraded to a catastrophe.
This is a very difficult problem.
The last thing is the scope of the relief,
which really is, I think, very broad here and that's what
Judge Shoob was recognizing. And as I said earlier, I do
think in an era of coupon settlements, a judge is
entitled to look at a case like this and say this is
really a remarkable result that has been achieved here,
and the normal rates -- normal prevailing market rates
don't compensate for this kind of result.
So I do think there are things that the
Court could point to in this case or in other cases to
try to cabin that discretion. I do think, though, that
discretion is an inherent feature of this statutory
regime, and this Court has tolerated a degree of
discretion in a variety of contexts including with
respect in the area of downward departures.
I do want to get, before I sit down, this
point about getting the incentives right, because one
thing that Congress was clearly very concerned about was
getting the incentive rights for counsel. And if you
accept Petitioner's position that the lodestar is a
ceiling and not something that is subject to adjustment
up or down, then what you are telling lawyers is the
that the maximum amount they can make in a civil rights
case is the minimum amount they can make in a different
case, where by the way they will get paid every 30 days
and their expenses will get reimbursed in real time.
Then you are also telling them something
else, which is, that's actually just a starter because
there are multiple ways for district courts to cut down
on the lodestar amount, either because you spent too
much time on this or we didn't like your travel
expenditures. And so there are multiple ways for those
hours to be cut down.
If you accept Petitioner's rule and there is
no way to get those rates bumped up in any
circumstances, then you are basically guaranteeing that,
as I say, the maximum you can make in a civil rights is
the minimum you can make in any other kind of cases.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there --
general counsel do that all the time when they get a
bill from a law firm. They cut it down. They say you
spent -- you’ve spent too much time with this associate
only because he or she is a first-year associate and is
learning and training; I'm not going to pay for that.
MR. CLEMENT: Two things, Mr. Chief --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's the same--
it's the same thing that happens when a district court
looks at the -- the lodestar and cuts it down.
MR. CLEMENT: Two things, Mr. Chief Justice:
One, it's the law of the Eleventh Circuit and I think
every circuit that before submitting your fees to the
court you are supposed to use billing judgment and take
care of some of those things, approximating maybe what
your client would do for you. But, second, and I think
more tellingly, the client may do that to you. The
client doesn't have the help of your opposing counsel to
egg them on and give them suggestions, and that's what a
district court does in the context of one of these
cases.
So I really think, as a practical matter,
you are systematically undercompensating counsel. And I
mean, if you want to take into account practicalities, I
am not here to reargue the Dague case, but if you want
to talk about practicalities, the fact that all of these
cases are contingency cases and the rational market for
those would be much higher than -- if you are worried
about sort of windfalls for plaintiff counsel in
these kind of cases, you really can worry about
something else, with all due respect, because the
combined effect of Dague and Casey makes it very
difficult to get sort of comparable compensation.
As I say, I am not here to reargue those
cases. I do think, frankly, Dague is distinguishable
because there you had the prevailing party language.
The other thing about Dague that’s distinguishable that
I will say before I sit down is one of this Court's
concerns in Dague was creating an asymmetry. Blanchard
had already said that contingency fees could not cap
your awards; they didn't want to have an asymmetrical
system. That's exactly what Petitioners are asking you
for, is a completely asymmetrical system. Farrar v.
Hobby says you can reduce downwards based on
exceptionally poor results. There would be no basis
whatsoever to even adjust a little bit under their rule
for exceptional results on the upside.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr.
Clement.
Mr. Cohen, you have 4 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK H. COHEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. COHEN: Than you, Your Honor.
I would like to start out with the little
joke that Mr. Clement made, is that you get what you pay
for. You do get what you pay for. Is because I am
getting paid half my hourly rate in this case means I
exert
half of what I would do for another client who would pay
my full rate? No. Because my professional
responsibility is that when I’m hired by a client for
an hourly rate, I’m supposed to represent that client
zealously within the bounds of the law.
So to say that in a case like this that
these lawyers would have done a different type of job
had they not known there was a possibility of a quality
enhancement is an insult, frankly, to Ms. Lowry and her
group, because they do this all the time. They do it
without getting an enhancement; they never asked for one
before. And, clearly, if this Court determines that a
quality enhancement is going to be available even in
rare or exceptional circumstances, you are going to have
arbitrary results and you are going to have
inconsistency which the analytical part of the lodestar
guards against.
Second point I would make is that Mr.
Clement mentioned about the New York rates and the
overhead. That was not the rationale for the district
court's awarding a quality -- or an enhancement here.
That was not part of it at all.
Getting back to what the court has
mentioned: "The best lawyer I have ever seen." Look at
what the purpose of this fee-shifting statute is. It's
to attract competent counsel by awarding them a
reasonable fee. What attorney is going -- who wouldn't
normally take a civil rights case is going to say:
Maybe I will take it, because maybe the judge will say
I'm the best he's ever seen or one of the best I've ever
seen? It's not a rational reason to give out there to
attract competent counsel. Counsel are going to take a
civil rights case because they know if they prevail they
are going to get their prevailing market rate, they are
going to get all their hours, their reasonable number of
hours put in. In this case, it was 25,000 hours over a
-year period. And they got their reasonable rates.
The judge also double-counted for quality
because Ms. Lowry got a $495 rate in part because of
her, quote, "stellar performance," as the district judge
decided. So to count that again by giving an
enhancement is impermissible double-counting, as this
Court has held in previous cases, including Delaware
Valley.
Finally, I would say that the district
judge's order in this case, if left undisturbed, will
create additional applications for enhancements and
whether they are granted or not, as Justice O'Connor
pointed out in the Delaware Valley II case in her
concurrence, it's not the issue of the rarity of the
granting of the enhancement. The issue is the
requesting of it. And the requests are going to come
out the wazoo, and district courts are going to be
deciding things arbitrarily and on different bases.
And for those reasons, we would respectfully
urge this Court to reverse.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this one final
question: We have a question of law before us, whether
there’s an absolute ceiling here.
Am I justified in assuming that if we could
reach the question of whether it was a reasonable
enhancement, there’s no argument about that?
MR. COHEN: I'm sorry, Your Honor. If you
determine that the enhancement was --
JUSTICE STEVENS: We are assuming for
purposes of decision that the enhancement was
reasonable, if that was -- if it's ever available,
because you are not challenging the amount. In other
words, you are making an argument of law. Even if they
give them a $10 enhancement, it would be exactly the
same issue before us.
MR. COHEN: We are arguing that the
enhancement in this case was unreasonable, Your Honor,
and --
JUSTICE STEVENS: That is not the question
presented in the cert petition.
MR. COHEN: Well, no, I understand that.
JUSTICE STEVENS: If I understand it, the
question of law presented is that even if the
enhancement had only been $1,000 --
MR. COHEN: That's correct.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you would say that was
equally wrong.
MR. COHEN: For quality or result.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.
MR. COHEN: For those two factors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
