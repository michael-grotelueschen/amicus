ORAL ARGUMENT OF COURTLAND REICHMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REICHMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it
please the Court:
On occasion a prior conviction that's used to
enhance a Federal sentence turns out to have been obtained
in violation of the Constitution. This Court addressed
the procedure for handling those challenges in Custis and
Daniels. Those cases determined that, in most
circumstances, the facts that would show the prior
conviction is unconstitutional do not support a claim
either at sentencing or under section 2255.
This is the key phrase in this case: facts
supporting the claim. It's the key part of the fourth
trigger in the 2255 statute of limitations. In this case,
the State court vacatur is the fact supporting the claim
for three reasons.
First, as expressed, Daniels made clear that the
underlying facts, those facts that you use for the
challenge to the prior conviction, do not support a claim
under 2255, leaving the vacatur as the operative fact.
Second, the plain meaning of the word fact
encompasses a vacatur just like courts often refer to
convictions as historical facts.
And third, there's no reason to dispense with
the plain language of the statute to serve policy ends.
The policies animating both AEDPA and section 2255 are
served by the rule advanced by petitioner. And moreover,
petitioner's rule will be a lot more straightforward in
application.
Let me --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: One little complication here.
Under 2255, even if that applies in this situation, it
does establish a 1-year statute of limitations. Right?
MR. REICHMAN: Correct.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And subsection (4) of that
section says: the date on which the facts supporting the
claim or claims presented could have been discovered
through the exercise of due diligence. Now, is that a
requirement that the defendant seek State relief on a
timely basis? Can the defendant just wait indefinitely
before going back to the State and seeking a vacatur? Or
does that due diligence requirement apply to the efforts
to get State action?
MR. REICHMAN: Well, there -- there are several
levels to the response. Let me work through them.
The first is that the petitioner's position
relies on a straightforward reading of the statute, and we
think that the due diligence requirement is satisfied when
the vacatur is discovered through the exercise of due
diligence.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but you're not being
responsive to my question. Here the defendant did go back
to the State courts and got this -- the earlier
convictions vacated. Right?
MR. REICHMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But I asked you, is there any
requirement that the defendant act promptly in going back
to the State to get the vacaturs?
MR. REICHMAN: There's no requirement in -- in
the fourth trigger. However --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, except that the statute
itself speaks of diligence.
Now, can the -- suppose he's been given a very
long Federal sentence and part of that is the result of
prior State convictions. And suppose he waits 10 years
before going back to the State to seek to overturn those
earlier State convictions. Is there no requirement that
he act promptly?
MR. REICHMAN: The requirement is not found in
the fourth trigger. The requirement is found in the State
statutes of limitations. And to elaborate on the
footnotes in our brief, we have found that there are
approximately --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but the Federal statute
says -- it puts a burden of diligence on the defendant.
MR. REICHMAN: Reading the plain language, we
think that burden of diligence applies to discovering the
vacatur. If you -- if a vacatur is a fact -- and I think
the Government has all but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How -- how could one not
discover the vacatur?
Here's my problem. I -- I frankly don't think
the text of -- of (4), part (4), really fits comfortably
with either your interpretation or the Government's. It
says the date on which the facts supporting the claim
could have been discovered through the exercise of
diligence.
Well, as you point out in your brief, the fact
supporting the claim here is simply the elimination of the
prior conviction, the vacatur of the prior conviction.
That's the fact supporting the claim, not the facts which
led to the vacatur, but it's the vacatur. So that makes
the Government's case a little uncomfortable.
But it seems to me you have to acknowledge that
your case is pretty uncomfortable when you -- when you
talk about discovering the fact of the -- of the vacatur.
I mean, it's a matter of public record. How does one
discover a -- a public record? How -- how could you need
due diligence to discover a public record? I mean, it
seems to me it's -- it's automatically -- isn't the
vacatur always served on the -- on the person whose
conviction is vacated? Isn't it always that person who
seeks the vacation? So what sense does it make to talk
about his discovering that particular fact? It seems to
me it makes no sense.
So you're left with -- with two competing
interpretations, both of which have some textual problems.
I'm inclined to think you take the one that makes sense,
given the purpose of the statute, and the purpose of the
statute, as Justice O'Connor has suggested, is to make
people bring up their claims promptly. And -- and that
purpose would -- would be served by the Government's rule
and not by yours. You say unless the State has some
statute of limitation, this -- this Federal requirement of
due diligence goes begging.
What's -- what's your response to that? You
really think -- especially about the discover.
MR. REICHMAN: I do and here's why, first,
starting with the language before I turn to the policy
side of your question.
On the language, paragraph (4), the fourth
trigger, is broad language that was meant to cover a
variety of circumstances, things from ineffective
assistance of counsel, to Brady violations, to vacaturs.
I'll grant you that if Congress only intended the vacatur
situation to be covered by paragraph (4), we might wonder
why they chose those particular words, but we know they
didn't intend this one circumstance.
I think the Government's position as to discover
boils down to this. Because the answer to the question,
when could the vacatur have been discovered through
reasonable diligence, is easy, the answer must be wrong.
And we don't believe that to be the case. We think that
you can easily ask when could the vacatur have been
discovered through the exercise of reasonable --
JUSTICE BREYER: And when it could have been
discovered I guess if he had taken due diligence and gone
and made the motion within a year, at least, of his having
been convicted in the Federal court.
I mean, I don't see how you can have it both
ways. You want us to read that phrase very broadly to
include under the word facts something like a vacatur, and
then it sounds to me you're being very literal and
linguistic when you say that due diligence to find the
facts shouldn't mean what I would take it as ordinarily
meaning, that -- that you have to, when you had a chance,
go back and generate this fact.
MR. REICHMAN: I --
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how you can do
both, in other words.
MR. REICHMAN: I think we can. I think both the
interpretations of each of those contested words are
strict interpretations right within the plain meaning.
And our case can boil down to asking whether there's
something wrong with my English language when I say, on
what day could the vacatur have been discovered through
the exercise of due diligence. It's --
JUSTICE BREYER: On the pure English language,
it's not exactly a fact.
MR. REICHMAN: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it's a legal
determination. We usually separate law from fact.
MR. REICHMAN: And -- and as we point out in our
brief, there's nothing -- in this context in particular, a
vacatur is like a conviction. It's a fact, you know, that
is -- is commonly referred to by the court.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, just so that I understand
your argument then, going back to Justice O'Connor's
question, if you get a long sentence, can you sit there
for 10 years, then initiate the process to get the earlier
conviction vacated and then say, as soon as it is, with
due diligence I'm here at the courthouse because, although
I waited 10 years, I have brought my 2255 as soon as I
learned that my earlier sentence had been vacated? Your
answer to that question, I take it, is yes, he satisfies
the statute.
MR. REICHMAN: He satisfies the statute, but I
need to point out something that I think is critical to
understanding this question. At the end of the day, we're
talking about at most six States where this might be at
issue. The rest of them either have laches or statutes of
limitations. And these are small States. We're talking
about a rule --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but in -- in six States,
I would have thought that, A, the due diligence language,
together with the general obvious policy of AEDPA, to get
this over with, would have made it very difficult to
conclude that he can sit there without doing anything for
10 years.
MR. REICHMAN: Well, I --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe it's only in six States,
but six States count.
MR. REICHMAN: They do count. But it ties into
the response -- the second part of Justice Scalia's
question is, isn't finality served? Isn't that what AEDPA
is all about? We don't believe that the Government's rule
that they propose will serve finality in the vast majority
of cases because in the vast majority of cases, you're
talking about claims that will have no merit in State
court. But because it's very difficult to complete the
State court habeas process before the 1 year in the first
paragraph, these petitioners will file placeholder
petitions in Federal court and have them held while they
finish their State court review. So what you're doing is
you're talking about these six States, maybe 10 guys a
year, you're going to cause, as the Brackett court on
remand said, thousands of placeholder petitions to be
filed, and you're needlessly extending all of those cases
so that you cut off the rights for maybe 10 people who
happen to be in these States.
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Here's -- here's a
simple way of looking at it. The minute that you're
convicted and you are subject to the enhanced sentence
based on a prior conviction, the obligation of due
diligence begins. You can't sit there for 10 years.
That's the point at which you've got to file your petition
so that you can come into court with reasonable
promptness, if not by the sentencing hearing itself, as
soon afterwards as the State process allows you.
That would be a simple due diligence point. It
wouldn't involve placeholder petitions, and it would get
things concluded with reasonable promptness. Why isn't
that a way of -- of applying the statute?
MR. REICHMAN: Because if you were going to be
strict about it -- and -- and I'm not sure I understand
all of the parameters of the hypothetical -- in --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Easy. The minute he's
convicted, the State has charged him and -- and -- or his
-- by some charging document has made clear that there is
going to be an invocation of a prior conviction for an
enhanced sentence. As soon as he is convicted of the
later offense in which that sentencing possibility has
been raised, he has an obligation to go into the State
court and start the process of -- of getting his earlier
conviction vacated. Easy.
MR. REICHMAN: If Mr. Johnson had done that in
this case, he still would have missed the 1-year statute
of limitations. If Mr. Gadsen had done that in the Fourth
Circuit case by Judge Wilkinson, he still would have
missed the 1-year statute of limitations.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But he would have acted with
due diligence and he would have had as -- I suppose, a
very powerful argument, which -- which the Government
apparently would accept, for -- for tolling.
MR. REICHMAN: For equitable tolling? Well, I
don't know that the Government would accept equitable
tolling.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, as I understood Justice
Souter's question, it is the alternate that the Government
said. The Government puts forward two arguments, and its
alternate argument sounds to me just like what Justice
Souter put to you, that is, he has to move diligently to
challenge those underlying convictions, that he cannot
challenge in Federal court because of -- was it -- Curtis
and Daniels.
Why isn't that an -- an accommodation of what we
know was the concern of the Federal court -- of the -- of
the Congress that people act diligently? It happens that
2255 wasn't framed with Curtis and Daniels in mind. There
isn't any indication that the drafters of 2255 were aware
of this peculiar situation where you can't make the
challenge in Federal court, you must go back to the State
forum. But we do know they were concerned with diligence.
MR. REICHMAN: Well, AEDPA was enacted after
Custis was decided and I think we presume that the
Congress was aware of the precedent, but the --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, wasn't -- didn't Mr.
Johnson here wait a couple of years after the Federal
sentencing before he tried to go back to the State courts?
MR. REICHMAN: Yes, he did.
The -- the -- our answer --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm not sure that was a
diligent sort of a -- an effort.
MR. REICHMAN: We believe it was diligent within
the -- the fourth trigger because, again, we rely on the
plain language. And the -- the fall-back position, to
address your question and Justice Souter's question, is
that we don't believe -- we believe this is engrafting a
whole different statutory scheme on top of the one that we
have. The fall-back position of the Government is to say,
all right, let's interpret the statute or rewrite it to
say that we're going to trigger the date on when the
vacatur could have been obtained, not when it could have
been discovered. And to do that, what they're saying is,
well, let's give him a year from the time of the Federal
sentencing. So -- or -- or maybe even earlier, dating
back to the time of the original conviction in State
court. So they add that 1-year statute of limitations.
Then they say then we'll add a provision that tolls during
the pendency of State habeas, and then we'll add another
1-year statute of limitations on top of that after the
vacatur is obtained. So we end up with -- instead of the
plain language, we have two 1-year statutes of limitations
with a tolling provision in between, the type of tolling
provision that is, by the way, in section 2244.
We believe that petitioner's interpretation,
although the answer is not difficult, it -- it is the
correct answer. On what date did the -- could the vacatur
have been discovered through the exercise of due
diligence? And the answer I think was --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you -- you have to
concede that you are watering down almost to nothing any
due diligence requirement because on your reading of the
statute, there isn't -- there isn't any such requirement.
MR. REICHMAN: Well, we think that that is --
I'll -- I'll say that there's no -- we don't believe that
there is a requirement in the Federal statute, in
agreement with -- with your statement, to exercise
diligence and seeking the vacatur. But we believe that
that is a necessary consequence of the administrative
decision that this Court made in Custis and Daniels to
send these back to the State court.
It -- it could have been the case that these
were all challenged at sentencing, and in fact, I think
that was the prevailing practice before Custis, that they
were challenged at sentencing. But Custis and then
followed on by Daniels made a different decision, and I
think a good one. It made the decision to wrap these
challenges back to the State and that inevitably will
result in delays as it works it way through the State.
The rationale for the Court's decision makes
perfect sense when you apply it to this context. One of
the key concerns, it seems to me, that the Court had was
that if you allow these Federal challenges that are
outside the State statute of limitations, then it's very
possible the State is not going to have the records
necessary to defend it because they wouldn't be expected
to keep records outside of their statute of limitations.
And that's simply not the case here because
these challenges, under the petitioner's rule, would be
within the State statutes of limitations, and as this
Court recognized in Daniels, the States have a powerful
interest in defending their convictions and that powerful
interest, it seems to me, would lead them to preserve the
records necessary to maintain their convictions.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you make the argument or is
it implicit in your argument -- maybe you don't have this
concern -- that if you imply a Federal due diligence
standard on your duty to vacate the State conviction, that
it's just too burdensome on the petitioner who has to
begin fighting the vacatur battle at the same time that he
has only 1 year to complete his habeas with reference to
the other challenges to his conviction?
MR. REICHMAN: That is not something that we've
argued in the briefs. It -- it, no doubt, is true
especially when you're talking about a pro se petitioner.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask? You mentioned -- I
just want to be sure I understand your point -- that there
are only six States that are really affected by this rule.
Is that because all the other States have State
limitations periods that require the prisoner to act
promptly?
MR. REICHMAN: Limitations period by statute or
they have a laches principle that would limit the ability.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So that the -- the
hypothetical of the prisoner waiting 10 years to challenge
the State conviction can only arise in a few States. Is
that right?
MR. REICHMAN: That's right, and from what I can
tell from the Department of Justice statistics, there are
even fewer number of convictions in those States, and best
I can back-of-the-envelope it, we're talking about maybe I
think less than 10 people per year.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In those -- in those six
States or those few States --
MR. REICHMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- have those States all made
clear they'd say we will never apply laches, or is it just
the case that there have never -- there's never been an
instance where the laches issue was presented to them?
MR. REICHMAN: The latter is more accurate. I'm
-- I'm -- I was trying not to overreach, but I went with
the cases that States that were clear that laches would
apply either by statute or by case law.
And why this becomes particularly important to
me is because we think the petitioner's rule serves the
ends of the Federal court overall, especially when you're
talking about finality because it seems to be the tail
wagging the dog, in a way, to have a rule that cuts off
the possibility of the 10-year scenario for these few
cases and then causes thousands of placeholder petitions
to be filed and managed. And it has been pointed, you
know, average non-merits dismissal, we're talking about
roughly 260 days. It's a burden on the court that's
unnecessary, particularly to bring it back, when we think
that in light of Custis and Daniels, the plain language
takes us all the way there.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know -- I know --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you have any
explanation of why your client waited so long?
MR. REICHMAN: The record doesn't reveal except
that he is pro se.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Pro se.
MR. REICHMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- that was the question
I was going to ask. With respect to -- he came into
Federal court and he said -- a little -- like 3 days too
late to move to extend the time to file the 2255. That
motion was denied. That motion was made in April of '97,
and then he doesn't file for State habeas to get rid of
those prior convictions until February of '98. Is -- is
there any indication of why, when the Federal court says
we're not going to extend your time, he waits so long to
go to the State court?
MR. REICHMAN: There's -- I'm aware of the
facts, but there's none in the record other than the fact
that he's pro se and has limited education.
I want to point out one thing that -- that I
think is important perhaps, if -- if the Court were to go
a way of equitable tolling, which as I've said, I don't
believe is appropriate. But you mentioned that it was 3
days too late that he filed. Looking back at the record,
I -- I don't think that's accurate. It shows that it was
received by the court on April 25th, 1997, which is 1 day
after the grace period under AEDPA which -- it expired on
April 24th, 1997. Well, he did it by mail, and under the
mailbox rule, that would have been a timely motion to the
extent that we are concerned with equitable tolling and --
and permitting the placeholder petition of that kind.
But again, this -- this difficulty in managing
the process is familiar to the court because it -- it's
what happens when you have these pro se petitioners.
The important thing in this case, we believe,
the core concern is with the plain language of the
statute. Because Daniels in substance said, the
underlying facts to a State court vacatur do not support a
claim, we believe that you have to read section 2255,
paragraph (4) to say that, okay, then the operative fact
is a vacatur.
And this case -- it's a very real concern
because without the prior convictions that were later
vacated, Mr. Johnson would have a roughly 7-year sentence.
Those prior convictions that were vacated -- and we all
can conclude now were unconstitutional -- added 8 more
years on his sentence. He's serving more time on the
enhancements than he was on the underlying sentence. And
of course, the sentencing scheme depends on reliability of
the information used for purposes of sentencing, and
that's why Congress chose to enact the fourth paragraph
and the statute of limitations so that there would be an
opportunity to correct unreliable information when it came
to light and it was discovered.
If there are no further questions, I would
reserve the remainder of my time.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You may. Thank you.
Mr. Himmelfarb.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Stevens, and may it
please the Court:
Petitioner's State court habeas corpus petition,
which challenged his guilty plea on a ground available at
the time of the plea, was filed nearly 9 years after the
plea was entered and nearly 2 years after a subsequent
Federal conviction became final. Petitioner,
nevertheless, contends that the challenge to his Federal
sentence was timely under AEDPA's 1-year statute of
limitations because it was filed within a year of the date
on which his State conviction was vacated. That
interpretation, which enables a defendant to extend the
limitation period for challenging his Federal conviction
by delaying a challenge to his State conviction, is
fundamentally at odds with the statutory text, the
statutory purpose, and the overall statutory scheme.
To begin with the statutory scheme, under clause
(1) of AEDPA's limitation provision, the presumptive rule
is that a defendant wishing to -- to collaterally
challenge a Federal conviction has a year from the date on
which the conviction becomes final.
Clauses (2), (3) -- (2), (3), and (4) create
exceptions to that general rule when a prisoner is unable
to comply with the rule in clause (1) for reasons beyond
his control. The fundamental flaw in petitioner's
interpretation is that it would excuse compliance with the
presumptive rule in clause (1) for a reason that is not
beyond his control, a failure to exercise diligence in
challenging his State conviction.
Petitioner's interpretation is also inconsistent
with the statutory purpose of the limitation provision.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, are you saying that (4)
is inapplicable?
MR. HIMMELFARB: No, Justice Kennedy. We agree
that (4) is applicable in a case like this. It's just
that our position is that petitioner's interpretation of
it is wrong. We offer two alternative interpretations of
how paragraph 6(4) would apply in a case like this.
Before I get to them, I'd like to respond to a
question that you asked when petitioner's counsel was
standing up here, and that had to do with the difficulty
of getting everything that needed to be done done in the
space of a year.
It's critical to keep in mind that in the
typical case of this type, the factual basis for the State
claim is going to available at the time of the State
guilty or trial, which in almost every case is going to be
years before the Federal conviction becomes final. And
since the limitation provision under AEDPA runs from the
latest of the four dates, in a typical case a defendant is
going to have many years to seek the vacatur of a State
conviction and he'll have up until a year after his
Federal conviction becomes final to challenge it.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But do you agree with your
opponent that most States have their own limitations
period that will reduce the number of cases in which there
can be inordinate delay?
MR. HIMMELFARB: Some States do have statutes of
limitations. Many don't. Massachusetts is a prime
example. It doesn't. Many of the cases of this type that
come through the Federal courts arise based on a -- a
vacated Massachusetts conviction. My understanding is
that perhaps as many as half the States don't have
limitation provisions in non-capital cases.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But he says some of them have
doctrines of laches that would kick in.
MR. HIMMELFARB: I think that's -- that -- that
may well be true, Justice Stevens, but laches is a much
more -- a -- a case-by-case --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It -- it does seem to me that
the State has a greater interest than the Federal
Government does in the finality of its own convictions,
and so the State would be the primary guardian of
preventing dilatory tactics, it would seem to me.
MR. HIMMELFARB: The -- the State does have an
interest. The problem is that when there's a delay in
filing a challenge to a State conviction, one of two
things can be happen -- can happen, and the cases bear
this out. One is that you have a State prosecutor who is
perfectly diligent and wants to defend the conviction but,
because of the lapse of time, can't because the requisite
records aren't available. The other thing you see in some
of these cases is that because the State sentence has been
served by the time it's challenged in cases of this type,
the State prosecutor doesn't have the same kind of
incentive --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as to your first --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I was going to say that. What
-- what -- excuse me.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as to your first -- as to
your first instance, if there's lack of diligence, then
there's laches. If the records are destroyed, somebody
sits on their rights and the records are destroyed, then
you have an obvious defense of laches.
MR. HIMMELFARB: The -- the important point,
Justice Kennedy, is the limitation provision at issue here
has to do with the finality of Federal convictions.
Congress was concerned that challenges to Federal
convictions not be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're -- yes, I -- I
recognize that that's going to be the ultimate issue, but
your point was, oh, well, the State is powerless because
the prosecutor might not have the records. The States
have laches provisions precisely for that circumstance.
MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Kennedy, we're not
saying that States are powerless, and there are many
cases, probably the majority of them, where States do
diligently defend their own convictions in cases of this
type. Unfortunately, the reported cases show that there
are many cases where either they're not able to or they're
unwilling to because the State sentence has long since
been served.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Himmelfarb --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, in this case now, the
petitioner did obtain a vacatur of the two State
convictions. Isn't that so? Don't we accept that as a
fact in this case?
MR. HIMMELFARB: Yes, Justice O'Connor. He
actually obtained vacatur of seven prior State
convictions, only one of which was relevant to the career
offender sentence that he received in the Federal case.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But he did succeed. And then
we have to look at whether the petitioner has complied
with section 2255 of AEDPA. And so we look to subpart
(4), do we not, in this case to answer that?
MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, in a case of this type,
you would have to look to both subpart (1) and subpart (4)
and determine which one gives him more time, and whichever
one gives him more time is the one that applies. We think
that 6(1) applies because under 6(4) he waited far too
long to challenge his State conviction.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's possible, but
you also question whether the vacatur can be a fact under
subsection (4).
MR. HIMMELFARB: We don't really, Justice
O'Connor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay.
MR. HIMMELFARB: I think the lower court placed
some weight on that idea. We don't dispute that if a
conviction is a fact, the vacatur can be as well.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay. You think that the --
the vacatur here could be a fact, but then you say that
even so, the petitioner didn't go back to State court
diligently and on a timely basis.
MR. HIMMELFARB: That's exactly right. The
textual language we rely on is not fact or facts
supporting the claim, but rather could have been
discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you say he was not
diligent in challenging those convictions.
MR. HIMMELFARB: That's -- that's absolutely our
position, Justice O'Connor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's -- go on.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Would -- would you comment on
-- on one difficulty I have with what, I take it, is your
preferred position of measuring due diligence from -- as I
understand it, from the -- the date at which the State
conviction became final?
Most of these -- I think it is fair to say that
most of the State convictions, like most convictions in --
in general, are going to rest on -- on guilty pleas. It
just is not realistic to assume that Congress assumed a
due diligence system which was going to require a State
defendant immediately to start a collateral attack on a
guilty plea. I mean, if -- if there -- if there were
reasons for the collateral attack that seemed strong and
worthwhile, he wouldn't have been entering the guilty
plea.
And it seems to me that if we're going to
measure due diligence from the date of conviction, most
convictions resting on pleas, as a practical matter under
your system, a conviction that rests on a plea is never
going to be subject to a timely challenge for purposes of
applying 2255. Is -- is that a fair comment, or have I --
have I missed something?
MR. HIMMELFARB: No. We -- we disagree, Justice
Souter. And if I could, I'd like to say a little bit
about the -- the proposal you made when petitioner's
counsel was up here about when the diligence could be
measured from. And I think your suggestion was that it
could be measured from the time of the Federal conviction
or --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
MR. HIMMELFARB: -- perhaps the time that
Federal charges are brought because at that time, that's
when the defendant has the incentive to -- to challenge
the State conviction. We obviously prefer that
interpretation to the one offered by petitioner.
We think the two that we offer are better than
that one for a couple of reasons. The first is that we
think that our two --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, would you comment
specifically on your preferred position which starts at
the very -- as I understand it, starts at the earliest
date, which would be the date of the State conviction?
MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. We think that's
consistent with the text because the diligence has to be
connected in some way to the facts supporting the claim,
and we think you could take the view that in a case of
this type, particularly given the diligence requirement,
the facts supporting the claim either means the facts
supporting the State claim or it means the vacatur of the
State conviction.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but isn't it -- I guess my
problem is isn't -- isn't it a sense -- isn't your
argument for a sense of diligence which is really other-
wordly? At the moment the defendant's conviction based
upon his plea becomes final, it simply is unrealistic to
expect that any defendant would have an incentive to
attack that conviction. And -- and the result, it seems
to me, of -- of your position, your preferred position, is
if -- if diligence is measured from that moment, that no
defendant will ever be diligent because no defendant will
ever have an incentive at that point to be diligent.
MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Justice Souter, the -- we
think that there's a -- a textual problem with the
interpretation you're offering because it doesn't tie
diligence to facts supporting a claim.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how about the one you're
offering? Before you tell me why mine is bad, tell me why
yours does not suffer the -- the -- at least I think, the
objection that I've -- I've raised?
MR. HIMMELFARB: Because it avoids the problem
that you could have a Federal conviction long after, years
or a decade or a more after, the State conviction. And on
-- on your view, you would not be -- the -- the petitioner
would not be required to challenge a State conviction for
a decade or more until after --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's right. But
why is the requirement on your reading to challenge it
promptly after it is entered in these plea situations, not
a just totally unrealistic requirement that will never be
met and will result in a consequence that all State
convictions, resting upon pleas, will be, in effect,
insulated from later collateral attack when -- under --
for purpose of 2255?
MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Souter, an argument
along those lines was actually raised in Daniels itself
and rejected by the Court. And essentially what the Court
said is that whatever the incentives may be at the time of
the State conviction, the remedies are available, the
procedures are available. And if a defendant does not
avail himself of those remedies and procedures, at a
minimum he will know that so long as his State conviction
remains on the books, if he goes out and commits another
crime, he runs a risk that he will be subject to an
enhanced sentence based on the fact that he's committed
the prior crime. We think the same --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So you say we're all stuck with
that.
MR. HIMMELFARB: I think that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You don't mind, but -- if -- if
you think -- if you think there's anything to my
objection, you're in effect saying, too late.
MR. HIMMELFARB: I think that the arguments
against your objection weigh in favor of our
interpretation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure I agree
with your argument, but I suppose one answer to Justice
Souter is that you get the longer of (1) or (4), so that
you would always get at least 1 year. If the -- if the
State conviction was 10 years prior to the Federal
conviction and he waited and did nothing, I take it, he
still has 1 year because he gets the longer of the two
provisions.
MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE BREYER: It is right? Because I thought
that Justice Souter provided that, but you don't because
if you're relegated to (4) -- let's say it becomes final
quickly. If you're relegated to (4), what you're saying
is the date on which the facts supporting the claim could
have been discovered, if this is a conviction that took
place 10 years earlier, you are saying the date on which
those facts could have been discovered was 9 years earlier
or whenever he could have brought it -- brought the claim
in the -- in the State court.
MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. Under --
JUSTICE BREYER: So, therefore, it is not true
that he always has that year.
MR. HIMMELFARB: No. Under paragraph 6(4), what
you say is absolutely correct, as we see things.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. HIMMELFARB: But the -- the limitation
period under AEDPA runs from the latest of the four
dates --
JUSTICE BREYER: But if the date of judgment
became final prior to the running of (4), then he would
not have a year.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right.
Now, my question actually is the -- aside from
Justice Souter's practical point, it seemed to me that the
language here is different from Daniels and different in
the other cases. The language is the date on which facts
supporting the claim or claims presented could have been
discovered. And facts supporting the claim prior to there
being a claim are not facts supporting the claim. And
therefore, it seems as if it would run no later than the
moment when he presents the Federal claim. No earlier
than that could it run. So you have a year from the time
that you present the Federal claim. At that point, all
those facts that could have been discovered earlier, now
he has a year to call them to the attention of the court.
And of course, for reasons that you point out,
this is certainly a fact that could have been discovered
earlier. He could have brought his motion long before.
So what's wrong with that? It combines the
practical reason that Justice Souter mentioned with the
language of the statute.
MR. HIMMELFARB: Let me comment on the language,
if I could. If one were to read the phrase, facts
supporting the claim, completely in isolation, keeping in
mind only Daniels, but ignoring the broader statutory
context and the statutory purpose, it might well be the
case that the better reading is that the facts supporting
the claim is the vacatur of the State conviction not the
factual basis for the State claim.
But if you take into account the broader
statutory context and statutory purpose, in particular if
you take into account the due diligence requirement, we
think the better reading is that facts supporting the
claim, in the context of this limitation provision, is the
factual basis for the State claim. It is true --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I thought that you
conceded at the outset that the facts supporting the claim
is the vacatur. I -- I thought that you opened up with
that. And it -- it --
MR. HIMMELFARB: No, Justice Kennedy. What I
was agreeing to was the idea that a vacatur of a
conviction is a fact because in the lower court decision,
there seems to be some reliance on the idea that that's
not a fact at all. But in responding to Justice Breyer's
question --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the minute -- the minute
that you -- you say that, it -- it seems to me that you
have to accept the petitioner's argument.
MR. HIMMELFARB: I don't think so, Justice
Kennedy, and here's why. It is a true in a case of this
type that the facts supporting the claim -- excuse me --
the factual basis for the State claim is not the facts
supporting the Federal claim in a direct or proximate or
immediate or sufficient sense. It is the facts supporting
the Federal claim in an indirect, a but for, a once
removed, or a necessary sense. If a defendant has served
his State sentence, he's been sentenced to an enhanced
Federal sentence and he wants to challenge his Federal
sentence and he's armed with a factual predicate for a
State claim, so long as he takes the intermediate step of
going into Federal court and obtaining a vacatur of the
conviction, he can challenge his Federal sentence.
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm certainly not taking --
advocating the -- the defendant's position. I'm
advocating the position as follows.
Suppose it were not a vacatur. Suppose it were
a DNA test, and suppose it were a fact that the DNA test
identified a different perpetrator of a long-gone State
crime and it was definite.
Now, if no one thought of running that DNA test,
although they should have, until 4 years after the Federal
conviction, he's out of luck. He has 1 year from the
Federal conviction, and that 1 year he has to, during that
year, do everything, including bringing facts into being,
such as the result of the DNA test, that he had not
previously done. And that's consistent with the language.
It avoids Justice Souter's practical problem, and it does
not impose an unreasonable burden on the Government, I
wouldn't think, because he has just a year from
conviction.
MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Breyer, under our view,
the hypothetical you just gave would be one where a timely
2255 motion could be filed. If the DNA evidence were
discoverable in the exercise of due diligence only more
than a year after the Federal conviction became final such
that the defendant would not be within paragraph 6(1), he
would be able to file a timely 2255 motion under paragraph
6(4) if, within a year from the date that the DNA evidence
was discoverable through the exercise of due diligence, he
filed his State motion to get his State conviction
vacated, and allowing tolling of the period while the
State motion is pending, then filed his Federal motion
within that same 1-year period, he would be able to file a
timely 2255 motion. That's under our primary
interpretation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: From your answer, I take it
then you would agree with Judge Black in the Eleventh
Circuit that equitable tolling would apply. He goes to
State court within the year after his Federal conviction
becomes final. The State court is sitting on it for 2
years. The limitation, I take it from what you said,
would be tolled during that time.
MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right, Justice Ginsburg.
Under our primary interpretation, there would be tolling
during the 1-year period of the time while the motion, the
State motion, is pending in State court.
Our alternative interpretation doesn't depend on
tolling because it doesn't begin to run until the vacatur
of the State conviction could have been obtained. So it's
just the -- the time while the State motion is pending is
just excluded from the calculation as a matter of course
under our second interpretation.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May -- may I ask you sort of a
general background question? As I understand your basic
position, if the defendant lets things sit for too long,
he loses the right to challenge the State conviction. On
the -- and -- and what's -- what's at stake is an
enhancement based on the -- on the prior conviction. Is
there ever a time when the Federal Government loses the
right to use a very old conviction for enhancement
purposes?
MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, under -- under the
guidelines, depending upon the -- the length of the prison
term, I think very old convictions are not counted at all.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that right?
MR. HIMMELFARB: Yes. So -- so the length of
time from the date of the State conviction to the time of
the Federal sentencing can have a bearing upon what
sentence he's going --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Whether he gets the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that also true under the
Armed Career Criminal Act cases?
MR. HIMMELFARB: I -- I don't believe it is,
Justice Souter. I don't think there's any kind of time
limitation there the way there is in the guidelines.
The -- the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure which way that
cuts. In a -- in a sense, if that set of old convictions
is out of the way, then you won't be troubled by the loss
of records problem.
MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, that -- I think that's
actually a critical point, Justice Kennedy, because our
view is that a -- a State defendant should be required to
challenge his State conviction at the earliest possible
opportunity, and in most cases that will be soon after his
conviction in State court because that will be the time
when he knows about the basis for his State claim. If he
does that, by the time he gets to the Federal sentencing,
you're not going to have the issue in this case because
all will agree that that vacated State conviction can't be
counted towards his Federal sentence. So that's one of
the virtues of the interpretation we offer. It avoids
this circumstance entirely.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're not -- you're not
insisting on that super diligence because you say, well,
in every case he has at least a year to begin to try to
undo the State conviction.
MR. HIMMELFARB: That -- that's right, Justice
Ginsburg. We agree with that.
The -- the purpose of AEDPA's limitation
provision, to use this Court's language in Duncan v.
Walker, is to reduce the potential for delay on the road
to finality by restricting the time that a prospective
habeas petitioner has in which to seek habeas review. We
think petitioner's interpretation is inconsistent with
that purpose not only because it permits a delay in
challenging the State conviction and, as a consequence, in
challenging the Federal sentence, but because it
encourages it. As I mentioned before, the longer a
prisoner waits to challenge his State conviction, other
things being the same, the greater the likelihood of
success either because the necessary records that the
State would need to defend the judgment are unavailable or
because the State prosecutor has less of an incentive to
defend it than he might have while the sentence was still
being served.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Recently I -- I lost my
luggage. I had to go to the lost and found at the
airline, and the lady said has my plane landed yet.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was kind of stopped by that
question.
It seems to me this case is something like that.
I mean, this is just not a question the -- the defendant
asks until the Federal conviction arrives, which I --
which I suppose that argues for your 1-year --
MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, our --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- position, but it just seems
to me that the purpose of this doesn't begin to run until
he's been sentenced. And then he has to go through all
the -- the questioning as -- as to whether or not his
prior conviction is -- can be set aside, and he has to go
to State court to do that.
MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, the -- the important
point is that -- we think is that petitioner's
interpretation doesn't work because it gives a defendant
an indefinite period to challenge his State conviction,
and the only diligence that's required under his
interpretation is that you have to exercise diligence in
seeing whether the motion to vacate your State conviction
was granted whenever it was filed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may be but that also
may be what it says. I -- I don't follow your
interpretation of what is the meaning of facts supporting
the claim or claims. I mean, once you say that the facts
supporting the claim is the vacatur of the -- of the State
conviction, I mean, it seems that's the end of it.
MR. HIMMELFARB: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and as for due
diligence, yes, it doesn't seem to make much sense in that
context, but as pointed out by your friend on the other
side, it makes sense in all other contexts and -- and you
don't expect the language to be applicable all the time.
So what's wrong with that?
MR. HIMMELFARB: What's wrong with it is that we
think it's not only inconsistent with the basic principle
embodied in AEDPA's statute of limitations, we think it's
inconsistent with the very idea of a statute of
limitations.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It may well be, but that's how
they wrote it. I'm talking about the word facts.
MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How can this be a fact
supporting the -- you -- you want us to say a fact
supporting the conviction includes the facts that lead up
to the facts supporting the conviction or -- or supporting
the claim.
MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Scalia, if the Court
rejects our view that the facts supporting the claim under
paragraph 6(4) as the factual basis for the State claim,
we think it should still reject petitioner's
interpretation and should adopt our alternative
interpretation which is not subject to that objection
because our alternative interpretation assumes that the
facts supporting the claim is the vacatur of the State
conviction. But in light of the due diligence requirement
at the end of paragraph 6(4), the question is when could
that vacatur have been obtained and thus discovered
through the exercise of due diligence.
JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, you're saying
due diligence applies to an extraneous fact when you
could, in the simple sense, discover it. It applies to a
generated fact when you could have generated it.
MR. HIMMELFARB: That's absolutely our position,
Justice Souter.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask sort of a broad
question? Am I correct in assuming that this really isn't
the most important case we ever heard because it only
affects a handful of enhancements that don't really affect
the basic conviction or sentence; and secondly, that it's
clear that the -- from both the text of the statute and
whatever we know about the legislative history, that it's
a problem Congress never even thought about?
MR. HIMMELFARB: As to your first question,
Justice Stevens, one -- one would think that this is a
little bit of an unusual situation and you don't see too
many cases where it arises. Perhaps surprisingly, though,
there are quite a few reported decisions where this
arises. There is a 2 to 1 circuit split on this question.
There are some district courts from other circuits that
have weighed in. I believe there may be three or four
certiorari petitions pending in this Court from the
Eleventh Circuit that raise the same question.
As to whether Congress ever considered this
situation, I'm not aware of anything in the legislative
history that is an affirmative indication that it did. It
could well be --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And certainly they would have
phrased the statute one way or the other more clearly.
They could have done that.
MR. HIMMELFARB: That could well be, but of
course, it wouldn't be the -- the first time the Court
confronted a situation where there's a statutory text and
there's a set of facts that Congress didn't necessarily
consider when it was writing the text.
So we think our -- either our primary or our
fall-back position is preferable to petitioner's
interpretation for the fundamental reason that his
interpretation does not require diligence. It enables the
defendant to extend the limitation period through his own
actions, and we think it's simply foreign to the whole
notion of statutes of limitations to say that the
limitation period can be determined by actions that are
within the prisoner's control.
The court of appeals --
JUSTICE BREYER: You certainly -- wouldn't you
be making the opposite argument if it were a DNA test? If
it were a DNA test, you would certainly be arguing that
even though the results didn't come into existence until
32 years after his Federal conviction, that he could have
discovered it 38 years before because he could have asked
that the test then be performed.
MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Justice Breyer, the
question of whether a fact supporting a claim could have
been discovered through the exercise of due diligence is a
very fact-specific question which --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then -- then once
you admit that, you're going to have to find a difference
between this and the DNA test, or your position here, if
adopted, will catch you out there.
MR. HIMMELFARB: No. We don't think so because
we think that the analysis should be the same for this
case as it is for your typical case involving a statute of
limitations with a discovery rule. The question is on the
facts of this case, when could the factual basis of the
claim been discovered given the totality of the
information available to the plaintiff through the
exercise of due diligence. So we think it's precisely the
same situation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're still asking us -- I
mean, even -- even in your fall-back position -- your --
your principal position asks us to -- to play games with
the -- with the word facts, and your fall-back position
asks us to play games with the word discovered. You want
us to read discovered to mean either discovered or
obtained, which discovered just doesn't mean obtained. It
just doesn't.
MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, you're right, Justice
Scalia. The fall-back position presumes the correctness
of petitioner's interpretation of facts supporting the
claim.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb.
Mr. Reichman, you have, I think, 8 minutes left.
I'm not -- I'm sure you don't really need all 8.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF COURTLAND REICHMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REICHMAN: I hope not.
The Government's position boils down to this.
They're advocating for the statute they want, not the
statute they have. This statute says the fact that could
have been discovered with exercise of due diligence. And
once -- as this Court -- several Justices have recognized
once you admit that the vacatur is a fact, the
Government's entire argument unravels because what the
Government would have -- this Court holds -- is that the
facts supporting the claim is exactly what it held it
couldn't be in Daniels.
The -- underlying the Government's argument is,
I think, a principle that -- that does not make sense.
It's that the State can't be trusted to handle the
challenges to prior convictions. I think that is not only
against experience. It also cuts against this Court's
decisions, in particular, about Daniels. It talked about
the State having a strong interest in maintaining its
convictions.
The idea about AEDPA and finality I think is
also important. To answer your question, Justice Stevens,
no, this is not the most important case this Court has
ever heard. And I think that that ties into an important
point. To use my rough numbers, we're talking about at
this point with the six States, less than 10 guys that
might be in this 10-year scenario per year. I think
probably the number is more like three people per year.
And if the Brackett court, the court on the front lines
down there in the district court, the First Circuit is
right, we're talking about the results of the Government's
rule to be that thousands of placeholder petitions will be
filed so that petitioners don't lose their rights to
challenge their Federal sentence based on the vacatur of
their prior sentences. And when -- when I think about
what serves the ends of the statute and finality overall,
I think that to prolong all these other cases, these
thousands of cases --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would you need the
placeholder if the rule were, as Judge Black said it
should be, that if you go to the State court within the 1
year after your Federal conviction becomes final, then the
time that you are in the State court the statute will be
tolled? If that's the rule, then you don't need any
placeholder filings.
MR. REICHMAN: Two responses to that. First, if
that is the rule, I'm not sure I read the Eleventh Circuit
to be so crisp on it that you definitely get tolling. I
think it was a case-by-case determination. And anytime
you're in a soft -- what I call soft equitable tolling
situation where you don't know for sure, that's going to
lead to placeholder petitions.
Alternatively, if we're talking about a rule
that's a hard equitable tolling rule, that is, there is
tolling every time there's the pendency of the State
petition, well, it seems to me that we are adding a
provision very expressly to the statute that doesn't
exist. 2244 has exactly that tolling provision, and that
is not in this -- in the 2255 provision. And this Court
would be adding it, and we don't think that is
appropriate.
At the end of the day, there's been a question
about doesn't a tie go to the Government in this case
because of finality. That is, if both interpretations are
equally plausible, because of finality, doesn't it go to
the Government? Of course, you've heard me contest we
don't think it's a tie. We also don't think finality cuts
in the favor of the Government.
But even assuming we have a tie, we think that
-- that should -- the tie goes to the petitioner because
this statute is recognized in Clay as in derogation of
common law, and statutes and derogation of common law are
to be strictly construed.
Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Reichman.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the
