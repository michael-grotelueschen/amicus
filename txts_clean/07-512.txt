CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear
argument next this morning in Case 07-512, Pacific Bell
v. LinkLine Communications.
Mr. Panner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON PANNER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PANNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's
decision because it asserts that this Court's holding in
Trinko and principles regarding unilateral pricing
decisions as explained in Brooke and elsewhere.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are probably
feeling pretty good about your chances since your
opponent has given up, right?
(Laughter.)
MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, it is correct
that this Court observed in Roberts that the
Respondents' agreement that the legal position of the
court below is incorrect, certainly should provide this
Court great comfort in reversing the decision in the
Ninth Circuit. And, indeed, a decision on the merits
here is important because the Ninth Circuit's decision
is harmful to consumers, deterring beneficial price cuts
and sufficient particle integration.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any question should
we have about the Article III status of this aspect of
the dispute?
MR. PANNER: No, Your Honor. The parties'
agreement on a point of law does not deprive this Court
of jurisdiction in any way, and the parties remain
adverse in this case. The Respondents continue to
pursue a section 2 claim, and the same intend to --
evidently intend to pursue the same relief.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you might be
right, but, you know, with respect to standing we have
held that that is an issue-by-issue inquiry, not a live
case broadly conceived.
MR. PANNER: Well, in Laidlaw the Court said
that it was for a particular type of relief, that the
plaintiff had to establish standing, but that's not at
issue here. The Respondents continue to pursue a
section 2 claim and pursue, evidently, the same type of
relief based on the same course of conduct.
I would also like to point out that
Respondents, while conceding that the position of the
Ninth Circuit was incorrect, have not clearly stated
that they would not take advantage of a decision by this
--
Court affirming the Ninth Circuit. And I think that
that's important, because there really would be no
reason for these Respondents to say that if for whatever
reason the Court decided that the Ninth Circuit is
right, that they would not go ahead and take advantage
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought they asked to
have the Ninth Circuit decision vacated. They didn't
ask us to affirm it. They said vacate that decision is
wrong.
MR. PANNER: That is right,
Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that if this Court
were to disagree -- for example, it is well established
that the Solicitor General's confession of error, for
example, or a State attorney general's confession of
error does not bind this Court. Indeed, a party's
position with respect to the proper disposition of the
case never binds the Court.
So the Court certainly has the power to say,
now that the case is properly before it: We think that
the Ninth Circuit got it right.
Obviously, we don't think that that's what
we think the Court should say; but, given that
circumstance, if the Court, for whatever reason, were to
affirm the Ninth Circuit, there would be nothing that
would bar the Respondents from taking advantage of that.
Even though they said that that was a legal error, if
that were the established law, there would be no reason
for them not to pursue it.
And I think that that's relevant, again, to
the question whether the parties remain adverse for
Article III purposes. As a jurisdictional issue, the
adversity of the parties with respect, even to the
section 2 claim, even if intended to pursue it
differently, the theory is sufficient.
But the point I am making is simply to
illustrate that adversity even with respect to the
narrow legal issue remains, even though they are not
contesting the proper -- contesting the proper
disposition of that legal issue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: When this comes up, we
usually, if a -- if a party abandons a position in
support of a decision, the court of appeals decision, we
have appointed -- as you noted in your brief, we have
appointed a friend of the court to represent the
position of the circuit.
And here we don't have that. We don't have
anyone that we have appointed and say you presented the
position. You defend the position below.
MR. PANNER: Well, that's true, Your Honor,
but there is an amicus arguing before the Court today
defending the Ninth Circuit's decision. And there were
two amicus briefs filed on that. Had those not been
filed, the Court could have sought additional help. But
the positions -- the arguments in favor of the Ninth
Circuit decision had been put forward in the amicus
brief, and there will be argument in support of the
Ninth Circuit's decision today.
And I think -- I think that the
jurisdictional issue is answered by your question. That
is to say, the fact that the Court could appoint amicus
shows that this Court retains Article III jurisdiction.
And it's very important in this case for the Court to
reach the merits of the decision and clearly to rule
that there is no independent price-squeeze theory under
Section 2 because recognition of such a theory, as in
the Ninth Circuit's, decision is very -- very harmful to
consumers.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any way in
which the resolution of their price-squeeze claim would
affect their Brooke Group Section 2 claim?
MR. PANNER: I think it could, Your Honor.
In their brief they refer to the possibility that the
wholesale price that was charged could be in some way a
proxy for costs. And this Court clearly stated that
there's a different issue as to whether a single
economic unit is charging prices below cost; that the
wholesale prices that may be charged are not an
appropriate proxy.
But I -- so, in that respect, I think that a
clear declaration with respect to what is required -- I
guess the distinction between the predatory-pricing
theory of liability and a price-squeeze claim as
recognized by the Ninth Circuit could have an impact.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just clarify: Are
you arguing there is never a price-squeeze claim under
Section 2? In other words, are you challenging Judge
Hand's reasoning in the Alcoa case?
MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, I believe, I
am challenging Judge Hand's reasoning in Alcoa. I think
that I would not go so far as to say that there would
never be a situation in which a price squeeze, that is,
an insufficient margin between wholesale and retail
prices to allow a competitor to compete -- that that
course of conduct could never support a claim under
Section 2.
But the basis for the claim would have to be
that there was a -- a duty to deal -- or a duty to deal
under Section 2, an antitrust duty to deal that was
effectively being debased through that sort of pricing
conduct. But --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Was there such a duty in
the Alcoa case?
MR. PANNER: Well, I think that the Alcoa
case was wrongly decided, Your Honor, in several
respects. The critical point about -- the first point
about Alcoa is that the conduct that was at issue was
said to be unlawful because it was an abuse of the power
in the ingot market and not monopolization of the
downstream market in sheet.
And so what Judge Hand said was that that
was unlawful. But he expressed some doubt as to whether
it was appropriate to treat it as an independent basis
for -- or an independent wrong under section 2.
But the notion that the abuse -- that
charging too high a price at the wholesale level could
be an independent section 2 wrong is quite inconsistent
with what this Court said in -- in -- most recently in
Trinko where it recognize --
JUSTICE BREYER: So there is regulation
involved there. I mean, suppose you had no regulation
at all involved. Why couldn't you have a monopolist at
the primary stage, say, ingot, and what that monopolist
wants to do is to extend its power into the secondary
stage, say, fabrication, in order to make it less likely
that there would be a new entries to attack its primary
monopoly? That would -- suppose you have those
circumstances? Perhaps they would be rare, but if you
have them, wouldn't that set forth a Section 2
violation?
MR. PANNER: It -- it -- it wouldn't, Your
Honor, for the following reason: That I think it is --
it is true that the -- the key point of the -- the basis
upon which the question -- the question presented has
been granted and upon which the analysis has to turn is
that there is no duty to deal at all at the wholesale
level.
So that the ingot monopolist has no
obligation to provide an ingot to a downstream rival.
And that judgment is a judgment that it is not worth
protecting downstream dependent competitors in order to
promote the competitive process.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be the
assumption on this case, but that may not be the
assumption on the next case. And I understood you to be
arguing that you wanted us to hold that at -- well, you
wanted us to hold whether we are dealing with a
regulatory case or in Justice Breyer's example, where
there is -- where there is no independent regulation,
that the greater includes the lesser; that A, there is
no duty to deal and therefore there is no obligation
that can be violated under the antitrust laws by a price
squeeze that does not rise to the level of predatory
pricing.
Is that your position?
MR. PANNER: Well, Justice Souter, trying to
be clear about the relationship.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the best way to do
that is to start with a yes or no answer. That way, so
I know where you are going.
MR. PANNER: Thank you, Your Honor. And I
think that's not precisely our position.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. PANNER: Our position is that in the
absence of a duty to deal, one does not look at an
allegation of insufficient margin as a potential section
--
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But what I think we
are trying to get at is, should we foresee a situation,
with or without the regulatory participation of
something like the agency here, in which there would be
a duty to deal, which would support a price squeeze
theory that did not amount to predatory pricing?
MR. PANNER: Your Honor, I don't think that
the Court has to anticipate that. I think what the
Court should say is that there are narrow circumstances
as recognized in Trinko, where there may be a duty to
deal under section 2. And in that circumstance there
may be conduct that constitutes a refusal to deal, even
a constructive refusal to deal.  There is really -- to
give a simple example, if a widget, if the downstream
product costs $10 and a widget is made available for a
million dollars, that is not really dealing at all.
But the point is that the section -- the
price squeeze piece of the allegation really does not
add to the underlying question of what is the section 2
duty that needs to be enforced.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's it -- I mean,
now maybe you can get me off what I am thinking, but now
it sounds that the answer to Justice Stevens's question
is yes. Now, I have, yes, overruled Judge Hand's
opinion in Alcoa. I always thought there were
circumstances, whether true of Alcoa or not, where that
did make out the claim, namely, the one I suggested.
Well, it's quite a different battle if, in
fact, the person whose injured, namely, the fabricator
who is complaining, has a place to go, such as the FCC
or the Alcoa regulatory agency, because under those
circumstances, he has a place to complain that these
prices are out of line.
But if there is no place to go, well, I'm
suddenly -- I'm a little hesitant to overturn Alcoa
under those circumstances, and the reason the duty to
deal doesn't deal with it is we could come into an
existing world where duty or no duty, there have been
independent fabricators who for a long time have bought
their ingot from this monopolist.
MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, the answer to
that is two-fold. First of all, because there is no
duty to deal, by assumption the producer of ingot, the
alleged wholesale monopolist, has the privilege to
withdraw the supply of that.
JUSTICE BREYER: Then I would say that
shouldn't be the law. The reason it shouldn't be the
law is because that ingot may, by either withdrawing or,
in fact, raising his price way above a competitive level
and charging just no room to remain in business, is
trying to drive out possible new entrants into the ingot
stage of the business. And the fabricators are a number
one out there as possibilities to break down the
monopolist in ingot.
And if that is the motive, as shown by the
behavior, there should be a section 2 claim. If you
want to argue that straight on the merits, what's the
answer to that argument?
MR. PANNER: The answer to that argument,
Your Honor, is the one that Trinko offers, is that it's
very important in establishing the antitrust rules to
recognize the incentive that those rules will create for
investment and for innovation.
If the monopolist is forced to share the
benefit of the monopoly with downstream rivals on the
basis there is potential entry, that is going to be a
significant disincentive to innovation at the upstream
level. And the establishment of clear rules, ones that
recognize that in the general run of cases there is not
going to be harm and recognizes that the very scrutiny
of that conduct will deter beneficial conduct and
beneficial innovation and beneficial investment by the
upstream monopolist, that recognition is the one that
argues in favor of saying, in the absence of a duty to
deal, where -- where the wholesale input could be
withdraw from the market and where, therefore, the
incremental harm from a price squeeze is really quite
hard to identify. But that in that circumstance it is
inappropriate to recognize any sort of a duty under
section 2.
JUSTICE BREYER: Just out of curiosity, is
there a place where in this case the plaintiffs could
go, a place which has a label "regulator" under it?
MR. PANNER: Yes, there is, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: And that place is --
MR. PANNER: The Federal Communications
Commission.
JUSTICE BREYER: So we needn't reach the
issue in this case?
MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, I think that
the -- significant regulation is not necessary. I agree
with Your Honor that that is a factor that the Court
could allow to be placed somehow on the scale. But the
analysis that took place in Trinko is, first of all,
whether there is an antitrust duty there at all and
whether to extend it in light of the regulatory scheme
that existed. And so, in this case, even in the absence
of regulation, there should be no duty under section 2.
JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to your
argument that there is going to be an upstream
disincentive to investment in the monopolist if we do
not come up with a clear rule that you want, are we at a
stage or is the fashion of economics at a stage where we
can say that there is a clear consensus supporting your
argument?
And if the answer is no, then isn't the only
sensible thing for this Court to do to is leave it to
rule of greedy?
MR. PANNER: Your Honor, I think there is a
consensus in all of the scholar literature that was
cited by the American Antitrust Institute, there wasn't
anyone who supported, there was no scholar who supported
the recognition of a price squeeze claim under section
. 	 I do think that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: For the reasons you gave,
in effect, the investment disincentive?
MR. PANNER: Well, I think the scholarly
literature that explains the recognition of price
squeeze duty would be harmful does indeed rely on the
sorts of reasons that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that, in effect,
uncontested within the profession except for the
margins?
MR. PANNER: I would assume as in any
academic discipline, there would be those who are trying
to find counterexamples. But I think the point there
and one for example Professor Carlton stresses in his
article and stressed another scholarly works is that the
search for the rare case itself can cause very grave
harm in the conduct that is following.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I follow the argument. The
trouble I have that I have is I don't know whether, in
the practical sense, that argument is a significant
argument or not. I don't know what's going on out
there. And unless we reach the point in which the
economic literature makes this a kind of slam dunk
decision, then it seems for me the only thing for a
Court to do is leave it for reasoning and analysis.
MR. PANNER: Well, I think that the Brooke
decision -- and as reaffirmed the answer to that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there --
MR. PANNER: There is a certain kinds of
conduct where it is possible to create a model where
there would be some negative consequences of the
conduct, but that the very search for it risks deterring
conduct that is of obvious benefit to the consumers.
And that's true here.
The recognition of an independent price
squeeze duty would deter retail price reductions that
are immediately beneficial to consumers, and it deters
entry into the downstream market by a vertical -- by a
wholesale monopolist who may then encounter a duty to
protect downstream rivals; and, of course, it would
deter voluntary dealing.
And I think that that you know, discussions
with my client reflect that this is a real effect, that
they are on the margin, the concern about the potential
for litigation makes investment and certainly
innovations not worth the gamble.
Unless the Court has further questions I,
will reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Maynard.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
If a retail level rival can state a section
claim against a vertically integrated company by
alleging nothing more than a margin-based price squeeze,
one of two outcomes will result. Either the vertically
integrated company will have to raise its retail prices
to its consumers or it will be forced to share the
benefits of its lawful monopoly with its rivals by
lowering its wholesale price. Either outcome is
inconsistent with this Court's antitrust jurisprudence.
As we know from Trinko, in the absence of a
duty to deal, a monopolist cannot be forced to share the
benefits of its lawful monopoly with its rivals at any
particular turn.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, do you join
in your colleague's suggestion that we should overrule
the Alcoa case?
MS. MAYNARD: I do think -- the government
believes the Alcoa case is wrongly decided,
Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it's
necessary to do so to decide this case?
MS. MAYNARD: I mean if -- I mean, one could
say that Judge Hand didn't necessarily recognize a price
squeeze claim standing alone, because he has some
language about, to the effect of perhaps this isn't an
independent wrong, but the way that he analyzed it
separately and the way courts have ruled -- have relied
upon it, to suggest that a mere margin-based price
squeeze without more, does state a section 2 claim, is
incorrect.
JUSTICE STEVENS: My question is really, you
think it's necessary to overrule that decision in order
to decide this case correctly?
MS. MAYNARD: Well, I don't think
technically it needs overruling. It's a Second Circuit
decision, and I think it is -- has in effect --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do we have to say it was
decided incorrectly?
MS. MAYNARD: I think the Court should say
it was decided incorrectly.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not my question.
MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Justice Stevens, I think
it's incorrect.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I know you think it's
incorrect. I am asking whether you think we have to say
it's incorrect in order to decide this case correctly?
MS. MAYNARD: Yes, unless you're willing to
say Judge Hand didn't hold that a price squeeze claim
without more is an independent theory that supports the
section 2 claim. As long as you think that's what he
did hold, and many people do think that is what he held,
then, yes, you do need to say that it was wrongly
decided and the government believes it is wrongly
decided, and that it has already been overruled.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why -- why can't we
just say Trinko is a case, as is this case, where there
is a regulator? So, in fact, if you, Mr. Plaintiff, are
upset about this, and feel you are being very badly
treated and squeezed out under circumstances where
competition might be hurt as a result, then you go to
the Commission, and you say: "This is an unreasonable
price. " All right?
Now I thought Trinko was a case where that
was involved.
MS. MAYNARD: The regulation,
Justice Breyer, in Trinko was relevant for two reasons
that are not relevant to the question before the Court
here. First, the Court looked to the regulations, the
regulatory duty, and made a decision whether the
regulatory duty itself created an antitrust duty to
deal, and the Court held it did not.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.
MS. MAYNARD: That holding is relevant here,
because it means that Petitioners' regulatory duty to
deal -- duty to deal does not create an antitrust duty
to deal. But then the Court went on and looked at the
Court's existing antitrust jurisprudence, to decide
whether or not the Court's antitrust jurisprudence
recognized a duty to deal in that circumstance, and
concluded it did not. It only looked to the regulation
that --
JUSTICE BREYER: But it -- it -- it said
that the issue in that case was a duty to deal. That's
not the issue in this case. And it was about Aspen, and
whether you had a duty to deal. And the Court said no,
you don't have a special duty to deal.
Here we are dealing with quite a different
thing. We are dealing with someone who has chosen to
deal in the past, and they are setting a price such that
the plaintiff thinks he is being squeezed out.
Now I can't find anything in Trinko that
tells me I can't say, we're at least not worried about
this where there is a regulator that you can go and
complain to. And if that's so, I don't have to reach
the question of whether Judge Hand is right or wrong.
What's wrong with what I just said?
MS. MAYNARD: Well, a couple of things. To
me, this case, as the case comes to the Court there is
no antitrust duty to deal.
And the -- the Petitioners here, the
district court determined weren't dealing voluntarily,
Justice Breyer; they were dealing as a result of
regulatory compulsion; but be that as it may, the -- the
important point from Trinko that is relevant here is
that a lawful monopolist without an antitrust duty to
deal has no duty to deal on any particular terms; and
Trinko specifically says that a lawful monopolist is
entitled to charge the monopoly price.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But --
MS. MAYNARD: In that case --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I didn't -- I didn't
want to interrupt your answer, go ahead -- just go
ahead.
MS. MAYNARD: I'm sorry. That takes the
wholesale price and possibility of lowering that,
Justice Breyer, off the table; and without the top
pincer as it were, there is no price squeeze; and that
leaves the Respondents with only a claim that the
Petitioner's prices are too low. And whenever a party
claims that its rival's prices are too low for it to be
able to compete, that triggers all of the concerns that
this Court expressed in Brooke Group.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it -- isn't it the
case that if in effect, we -- we refuse to come down
with a -- the kind of blanket answer, with a rule that
you want, that the parties here can go out -- the
complaining party here can go back to the FCC and say
there's something wrong with your wholesale pricing
order; look what's happening; and the FCC may adjust the
wholesale pricing order as a result of that.
And if that is true, if they can do that,
and the FCC can act, isn't that a good reason for us not
to be developing new antitrust doctrine, if there is no
need of it?
MS. MAYNARD: Well, the government's view is
that the current antitrust doctrine already forecloses
this claim for the reasons that I was explaining. Now
if the Court were going to consider this as whether were
you going to reach out and extend the antitrust law --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're certainly
asking us to -- at the very least -- to clarify the
significance of Alcoa. You're -- you are asking for an
articulation of something -- of the significance of
Alcoa today, which we have not done. So in that sense
you are asking for something more than we've got on the
books now; and my question is, if the agency in effect
can deal with -- with -- with what the -- the monopolist
is concerned with, and what the entrant is concerned
with, why do we have to take -- why is it wise for us to
take the step of making or clarifying new antitrust law?
MS. MAYNARD: Well, the -- the Respondents
here were attempting to press, and the Ninth Circuit has
allowed them to go forward on, a treble damages claim
where they seek $40 million under a pure margin-based
price squeeze theory. And in the government's view,
that -- such a rule would protect only competitors, and
doesn't allege any harm to the competitive process,
which section 2 requires.
Whether or not the FCC has regulatory
authority or not over the basic question -- over its own
issues -- isn't relevant to the antitrust question
before the Court here, which is, does the Court's
current antitrust jurisprudence foreclose such a pure
margin-based price squeeze.
And the government is not saying that there
might not be some exclusionary conduct, Justice Breyer,
that could someday be alleged, if there was an attempt
say, to claim an attempt of the upstream market, as you
were positing. That's not the claim here, nor in most
price squeeze claims of which I'm aware; the claim is
that they are attempting to monopolize the downstream
market. The government does not mean to foreclose; at
this point it has recognized there are myriad ways in
which companies can engage in exclusionary conduct. So
the government's position is a narrow one, which is that
a pure margin-based price squeeze, in the absence of a
duty to deal -- that is, this person who is dealing with
me is -- is charging me too much, so that I can't
compete against it at retail -- that is nothing more
than proof that they can't compete.
That doesn't show any harm to the
competitive process, which is what this Court has
repeatedly held is required for liability under section
, and for good reason. And Justice Souter, in response
to your question, the government is not saying that it
is not plausible that there isn't some anticompetitive
conduct that will go unchecked as a result of such a
rule, but the Court's analysis in Brooke Group is the
proper one, which is that ultimately what you will be
doing is telling a retail level competitor that it must
raise its prices in order to prevent liability.
That really isn't, as Mr. Panner said, worth
the candle, and it creates the risk of chilling
legitimate price cutting, and it puts the courts in the
role, essentially, of being a regulator, maybe not just
at one level, but at two.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So you are saying in
practical terms that if there is a squeeze, it's highly
unlikely it's going to be anything but a Brooke Group
kind of squeeze, and therefore it's --
MS. MAYNARD: That if there is something
anticompetitive going on, that section 2 cares about --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
MS. MAYNARD: -- they would need to allege
that the Petitioners' retail prices are below some
appropriate measure of the Petitioners' costs; and what
they want to do is essentially what Alcoa does, which is
why it's mistaken, is it attributes -- it would
attribute to Petitioners the wholesale price they are
willing to sell their upstream input to others, and what
Brooke Group makes clear is that the relevant cost is
the internal cost to the Petitioners.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I could just ask some
-- everything you said is applicable to a predatory
price claim as well as a price squeeze?
MS. MAYNARD: We believe that if they can
allege the elements of a predatory pricing claim under
Brooke Group, then they would still have that claim even
in the absence of a duty to deal, and then labeling it a
predatory price squeeze doesn't add anything. The court
just clarified that there isn't a separate price squeeze
liability. But there would remain a predatory pricing
theory under Brooke Group if those allegations could be
met.
Does that answer your question?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Thank you,
counsel.
Mr. Blecher?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAXWELL M. BLECHER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BLECHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I don't have a white flag and I don't think
we particularly have given up, but let me start by
suggesting that you don't need to decide the totality of
Alcoa. I think you need to vacate the decision of the
Ninth Circuit -- not because it's erroneous, but because
it's incomplete. Just send the case back to the
district court to consider Judge Gould's suggestion that
we file an amended complaint.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand what
you just said. Judge Gould dissented. He said the
Ninth Circuit majority was wrong. And you're urging us
to accept Judge Gould's position.
MR. BLECHER: Not -- yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can we do that
without saying that the majority was wrong?
MR. BLECHER: There is a difference between
being wrong and being incomplete. The Ninth Circuit
decision responded to a very narrow question certified
by the district judge, which was whether or not price
squeeze taken as a generic violation was subsumed or not
subsumed by the Trinko decision. It answered that
question correctly; but in doing that, it did not
consider whether or not price squeeze survived -- the
living margin part of price squeezing survived Brooke.
And to that extent, Judge Gould picked up
the -- the -- the argument and said, in effect,
especially in a regulated industry where the wholesale
price is -- is regulated, the offense of price squeeze
becomes predatory pricing, just as in a primary
Robinson-Patman case, the offense becomes predatory
pricing.
There is no more Robinson-Patman primary
line law. It's -- it's -- like it or not -- I'm not
saying we like it; I'm not saying we agree with it, but
the state of the law is that when you are challenging a
monopolist price under section 2 of the Sherman Act,
Brooke and its predecessors determine the legality of
the conduct. And that's -- and that's what we are
recognizing here.
Now, understand that when the issue was
framed to the Ninth Circuit, the district judge, in a
footnote, said he thought that they ought to consider
the Brooke issue, but he did not decide that question,
and he did not certify it. So when the Ninth Circuit --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you don't certify
questions; you certify orders. And in the certification
of this order, I take it, your position was in support
of what the district court did and in support of what
the court of appeals did, correct?
MR. BLECHER: Partly, Justice Kennedy. What
-- in part what we said was --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You made -- you made --
you made an argument, or did you not, that is consistent
with what the court of appeals did hold in this case?
MR. BLECHER: Well, I question whether
that's what they held. I view what they did is answer a
question: "Does a pure price squeeze get subsumed by
Trinko as it involves the question that we heard
articulated, the duty to deal?" Now --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was the court of appeals'
decision consistent with the argument that you made to
the court of appeals?
MR. BLECHER: It is consistent, but it
didn't say, we endorse Alcoa, and it didn't say we
require a -- a -- predatory pricing. It was silent on
the elements of the offense of a price squeeze. It
answered this very narrow question: Does price squeeze
generically -- is it an existing kind of antitrust
violation that is not subsumed by the Trinko rule?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I am
confused --
MR. BLECHER: That's all that was decided.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I am confused about
what you mean when you say "the price squeeze claim."
MR. BLECHER: A non-predatory --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that any
different -- is that any different than a Brooke Group
claim?
MR. BLECHER: A non-predatory price squeeze
case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you still want to
be able to argue that --
MR. BLECHER: No.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- above-cost retail
prices --
MR. BLECHER: No.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- somehow violate
Brooke Group?
MR. BLECHER: I am very content to go back
to file an amended complaint purely under Brooke for
this no games --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you -- you agree
that that requires --
MR. BLECHER: We would --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That requires
below-cost retail pricing?
MR. BLECHER: Yes. We have below-cost
pricing. I have no concern about that, because, unlike
what Mr. Panner told you, this is not proxy pricing.
This is a case in which AT&T is mandated by the FCC to
sell the DSL transfer to itself, to its own affiliate
and to outside independent companies like the plaintiffs
at the same price.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the wholesale
price claim that the Ninth Circuit looked at in -- in
the case below, in the decision below, a necessary or
significant or partial element of your Brooke Group
claim, or is it totally irrelevant?
MR. BLECHER: More or less irrelevant. Only
-- it only sets the benchmark for the costs that the
retail affiliate is selling below. There -- there is no
question the retail affiliate, in many of the time
periods covered by the complaint, sold below -- just the
DSL transport; and in addition to that, they threw in a
modem, installation, and online services. So, if you
put those into the cost bundle, they will be below cost
for the -- substantially the entire damage period that
we are complaining about; and --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the first -- is the
first time that you indicated that you were in agreement
with the Gould dissent in your -- the brief that you
filed here in this Court?
MR. BLECHER: Yes, directly, but we did
have --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it --
MR. BLECHER: -- a predatory pricing --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it seems to me that, in
that instance, you seriously prejudiced the Petitioners
here, and that that should be weighed heavily against
you when you ask to -- for permission to amend your
complaint in the district court.
MR. BLECHER: No --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, there have --
there have been costs and time --
MR. BLECHER: See, see-- Justice Kennedy,
you granted certiorari and agreed to review a decision
that was essentially moot, because the complaint that
you are talking about in this case has been superseded.
Judge Wilson said it was superseded by a complaint
charging predatory pricing, and he said, generously
construed, you have pled predatory pricing, and let's go
forward.
Judge Gould said he didn't think the
complaint under Twombly's standard which intervened
satisfied the Brooke standard; And so he said --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess it
would have been nice if you thought the case was
essentially moot, to hear about that in the cert
opposition.
MR. BLECHER: I'm sorry?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You didn't argue
that the decision below was essentially moot in your
opposition to certiorari here.
MR. BLECHER: In -- in the opposition,
that's correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Nor did you give notice to
the Petitioners' attorney that that was your position so
you could have asked for a stipulation on the point.
MR. BLECHER: Well, I think what you are
overlooking, though, is when we went to the Ninth
Circuit, we endorsed Judge Wilson's suggestion that they
decide the Brooke issue, so that, when we went back, we
would have guidance as to what the appropriate standard
was. They elected not to deal with either Alcoa or
Brooke. They just decided the very narrow question he
certified.
In the Ninth Circuit, AT&T said, to the
Ninth Circuit, don't reach the Brooke issue; you don't
need to reach the Brooke issue to decide this case, even
though the complaint you are ruling on has been
superseded by an allegation in an amended complaint that
states a Brooke violation, or purported to or attempted
to state a Brooke violation.
JUSTICE BREYER: So can we write this
following, we say: In the district court, as of this
moment, there is no complaint that alleges the price
squeeze theory of the majority of the Ninth Circuit.
There is a complaint that alleges a price theory under
Brooke -- a predatory pricing under Brooke Group. That
is what is there. Nothing else is there. Therefore,
that issue which the Ninth Circuit decided has no
--
bearing on this case. We therefore vacate their
decision, leaving it up to the district court to proceed
as it believes appropriate under the law with the Brooke
Group claim?
MR. BLECHER: I think --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that a possible thing to
say?
MR. BLECHER: And --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes or no, please.
MR. BLECHER: It avoids the need to --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is it, yes, we could do
that, or no --
MR. BLECHER: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes we can?
MR. BLECHER: Yes, you can. That's what
we're suggesting.
JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't it --
MR. BLECHER: That you --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- that --
MR. BLECHER: -- don't need to reach Alcoa
here, because the Ninth Circuit did not endorse Alcoa.
It just didn't reach that question.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Has the Brooke Group
complaint been allowed in the district court or was it
MR. BLECHER: It was allowed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, it was?
MR. BLECHER: Judge Wilson ruled that it
was, a, quote, "generously construed," we stated a
Brooke claim, and he would review it again at summary
judgment stage. Judge Gould disagreed with that, and he
said, if you want to state a Brooke claim, you should go
back and amend the complaint and do it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Breyer's
draft judgment said we would vacate the decision below.
Shouldn't we reverse it, because if we think on the
price squeeze claim, as distinct from the Brooke Group
claim, the Ninth Circuit was wrong. You don't just
throw it out and let everybody go home. You say whether
it was right or wrong. And if you are saying it's
wrong, we would reverse.
MR. BLECHER: That's certainly as an option,
but I think it would be more appropriate to vacate it
because I don't consider that they did a direct frontal
assault on Brooke. They didn't consider Brooke because
AT&T suggested that they didn't need to read it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Ninth Circuit had a
precedent that it thought it was following. Was it
Anaheim?
MR. BLECHER: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So isn't it important
that if you think that they were wrong and we agree with
you, that we get -- not just vacate but say you were
wrong on the law; you were wrong in this case, and you
were wrong in Anaheim. And then the Ninth Circuit will
not follow those decisions anymore.
MR. BLECHER: Well, that's if you want to
approach the rules and decide that there can only be a
price squeeze claim if the price is predatory. You may
want to get there. I'm saying you don't need to get
there here.
You could simply say the Ninth Circuit
decision, I think, correctly decided the very narrow
question that was presented by the certification order.
They abided AT&T's suggestion not to go outside that
order, and, therefore, their decision can be viewed as
incomplete because they didn't go on to discuss what the
elements of a price squeeze claim were.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are saying we
don't have to cross the Rubicon because your Brooke
Group predatory pricing claim will say that the prices
here were below cost?
MR. BLECHER: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we don't have to
consider, I guess, what I thought we had to consider --
MR. BLECHER: This is not a case where we
are confronting you with the necessity of the settings
or the vitality of Alcoa. You --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you are not
going to amend your complaint to raise such a claim on
remand?
MR. BLECHER: I am going to file an amended
complaint that will be limited entirely to the Brooke
predatory pricing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which you understand
to require that the retail prices be below cost?
MR. BLECHER: And we are very comfortable
with that. The answer is yes, and we are comfortable
with that. But we haven't given up, and we live to
fight another day on another field.
JUSTICE ALITO: But if we follow your
proposal, then, you could, in a case filed next week or
the week after we decide the case, assert exactly the
same claim that you asserted here originally, and that
would be good law in the Ninth Circuit?
MR. BLECHER: The answer to that,
Justice Alito, I think you can remand it --
JUSTICE ALITO: I don't mean in this case.
I mean in another case.
MR. BLECHER: Oh, we could raise that, and
the Ninth Circuit --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Either you or anybody else
in the Ninth Circuit?
MR. BLECHER: I think if you abide my idea
how to deal with this, the issue of Alcoa's vitality
would remain open to be decided in another case on
another day.
JUSTICE BREYER: If we vacate, you would be
in favor of vacating their decision?
MR. BLECHER: Yes, because a vacation can
rest on grounds that the Ninth Circuit did not reach the
issue. They said, we are prepared to abide Judge
Gould's view that, in a regulated industry, we can only
have a, quote, "price squeeze" if the price is
predatory.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the reason you
think we should vacate is not because the Ninth Circuit
didn't decide the question, but because you are willing
not to press it?
MR. BLECHER: No. I don't think they
decided the Alcoa question. That's the way I read the
decision. Because I know what was certified. I know
what they said. They responded only to a very narrow
question, and AT&T said don't venture beyond that.
Don't --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, I guess -- I
guess that's where we are about to go. But in answer to
Justice Alito's question, if you think the Ninth Circuit
was wrong and don't want to see those claims raised
again, we need to address the merits and reverse?
MR. BLECHER: Or you can simply say that the
case is remanded, the district court may decide the
propriety of an amended complaint, except that the
amended complaint cannot state a non-predatory price
squeeze claim. We are prepared to live with that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. BLECHER: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Brunell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD M. BRUNELL
ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ANTITRUST
INSTITUTE, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BRUNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
We think the proper disposition of this case
is to vacate the decision below and to remand and let
the district court decide whether the complaint should
be amended or not. Vacating the judgment would amount
to a dismissal with prejudice of the price squeeze
claim, and, therefore, this Court would have nothing to
decide.
The Court doesn't need to reach out to
decide the vitality of Alcoa, the question of which is
not even presented by the question raised in the cert
petition. And there are many reasons why -- and I am
happy to address why Alcoa should remain good law, if
the Court wishes to get into that. However, we don't
think it's necessary.
On the specific issue here, if the Court
decides not to vacate the judgment below and wants to
examine the correctness of the Ninth Circuit judgment,
the specific issue of whether the absence of a duty to
deal thereby dooms any kind of claim -- a price squeeze
claim or really any other type of antitrust claim,
including a predatory pricing claim, if the regulators
can address the issue.
We think that is -- that is the case, that
that is the incorrect view of the law, and indeed, to
some extent we agree with the Solicitor General that the
existence of a regulatory remedy is not sufficient to
bar a price-squeeze claim because there is no exhaustion
requirement under the antitrust laws, and this Court's
decision in Trinko, as the Solicitor General suggested
when it looked at the regulatory remedies, that was with
respect to expanding section 2 enforcement and not with
respect to traditional antitrust claims, which Alcoa
certainly is.
Now, with respect to the issue of the duty
to deal. What does that mean, that there's no duty to
deal? In our view --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that means
they don't have to deal. They don't have to sell you
the stuff if they don't want to.
MR. BRUNELL: In our view, it means that a
court has found that there's no liability in the event
of a refusal to deal, which is what Trinko did. And one
has to ask whether the rationale for finding no
liability for refusal to deal also applies to a
predatory -- excuse me, a price squeeze claim.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean a Brooke
Group retail price squeeze claim?
MR. BRUNELL: No, I mean a traditional price
squeeze claim. That doesn't have to meet the Brooke
Group standard. Mr. Panner suggested --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this: I'm not
familiar on this point. Apart from Alcoa, what are the
cases applying a traditional price squeeze claim?
MR. BRUNELL: We've listed them in our
brief. I believe that 9 out of the 12 circuits, not
including the Federal Circuit, have recognized an
Alcoa-type price squeeze claim. And in the other three
circuits, district courts -- in each of the other three
circuits, district courts have recognized an Alcoa-type
claim.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree with your
opponent's submission that antitrust scholars uniformly
agree that the Alcoa case was incorrectly decided?
MR. BRUNELL: No, I do not agree with that.
And, indeed, our brief cites an eminent professor, John
Vickers at Oxford, an economist who supports a
traditional Alcoa-type claim, that is a claim based on
what we've call the transfer price test, where one looks
at the margin between the retail and wholesale prices
and asks whether that is sufficient to cover the
monopolist's downstream costs. Professor Vickers --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Does he support --
MR. BRUNELL: Pardon me?
JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought somebody else was
-- does he support recognition of that claim in the
circumstances in which there was regulatory involvement
like the FCC here?
MR. BRUNELL: I believe he does, Your Honor.
I believe the European Commission also recognizes such a
claim in the presence of regulation. I believe the
Federal Trade Commission recognizes such a claim.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do we need to?
MR. BRUNELL: Why do we need to? Because
a -- you mean in the absence why can't regulation handle
this or why do we worry about the anticompetitive
effects of a price squeeze?
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why can't regulation handle
MR. BRUNELL: Well, in this case, regulation
-- simply the -- the regulation that is referred to is
simply the prospect of the complainant going to the
Federal Communications Commission and simply asking for
some kind of post hoc relief, as opposed to a situation
as in Town of Concord or in Trinko where the regulation
at issue was quite extensive. All of the conduct at
issue in Trinko was heavily regulated. And in this
case, we have wholesale rates that are lightly regulated
and retail rates that are completely unregulated.
JUSTICE BREYER: So why couldn't you -- why
wouldn't you -- couldn't you go to the FCC or the other
regulator and say: Regulator, they are selling me this
widget or line at a dollar. All right. That's
considerably higher than their costs of producing it.
And, in addition to that, they sell the same service I
do for $1.20, even though it costs me or would cost any
human being at least 60 cents to provide that added
service. So we are asking you to tell them that if they
continue to sell it at $1.20, they lower their wholesale
price to us so that we only have to pay at most 80
cents, or whatever the right number is there.
I mean, they have someone to complain to.
They could make the same complaint. I'm quite surprised
that Vickers has written that under the circumstances I
have outlined that there is a valid price squeeze
antitrust claim or that the British Commission has held
that.
I would be very interested to know the
citation of that. Because he may have done. I don't
read everything.
MR. BRUNELL: The European commission --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying the European
Commission. They have done all kinds of things. I am
saying the -- the --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: I am saying the British
Monopolies or Restricted Practices Commission of which
Vickers was the head. I agree with you that he is very
knowledgeable, but I would be surprised if he had
written contrary to what I just said in that example.
But I am often surprised and willing to read it.
MR. BRUNELL: The question of the
relationship between the regulatory authority to address
a question and whether an antitrust claim exists is
normally decided on the basis of implied antitrust
immunity. The mere existence of a regulatory remedy is
insufficient under this Court's precedent in Credit
Suisse, certainly, for -- for having implied immunity.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would you say that
absent the regulatory regime, there would be a duty to
deal here?
MR. BRUNELL: Absent the regulatory regime,
would there be a duty to deal? Would the Court have
found -- in this case, the Petitioners may well have
voluntarily dealt with the Respondents --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. My question was:
Was there a duty to deal under the antitrust laws?
Because it seems to me the only reason that there is a
duty to deal is because of the regulation. So, you use
the regulation in order to establish the duty, but then
you don't want to go to the regulators to regulate the
price. And it seems to me that that's inconsistent.
MR. BRUNELL: Whether there is a duty to
deal can only be answered by asking whether a violation
-- a refusal to deal would constitute an antitrust
violation. And in this case, had -- had there been no
required dealing and, therefore, no dealing whatsoever,
then the issue of antitrust duty to deal would be
totally academic. Furthermore --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's still seems to me
that you, therefore, must rely on the regulation to
establish the initial predicate of a duty to deal. And
You rely on the regulation that far, but you don't want
to go to the regulators to -- to argue about the price.
You want us to look at regulation first and antitrust
law second.
Why can't we just look at this case as
purely antitrust; and then, as Justice Breyer said, if
it's a regulatory problem, go to the regulators.
MR. BRUNELL: Well, the mere fact that there
is a regulatory duty to deal does not completely oust
antitrust. Otherwise, there would be no predatory-
pricing claim.
The petitioner -- the -- the respondent
injured by a predatory-pricing claim could also go to
the FCC, presumably. And we don't -- and no one is
contending that the -- that a predatory-pricing claim
wouldn't lie and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that lie here first?
I mean, you don't -- you don't think -- you don't think
that the regulatory agency would be acting properly if
it prescribed a price that was predatory or allowed the
charge of a price that was predatory, would you?
MR. BRUNELL: No. I -- I don't think the
regulators would -- would permit predatory pricing.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They wouldn't permit it.
Then is there -- is there no such thing as primary
agency responsibility to take care of that problem
rather than rushing into a court and take care of it
through the -- through the Sherman Act?
MR. BRUNELL: There certainly is the
doctrine of primary jurisdiction, which arises typically
when the agency is already dealing with a problem and
not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they are dealing with
the problem there. They are decreeing the price that
could be charged, aren't they? Don't they have to
approve the pricing?
MR. BRUNELL: They certainly don't approve
the retail pricing, no. The retail pricing in this case
is entirely unregulated. It purports to be in a
competitive market.
But let me back up for one second. The --
the regulatory regime here is quite different from the
one in Trinko. In -- in Trinko you had a regulatory
duty that essentially required the monopolist to
cooperate with its rivals in the monopoly market in
order to dismantle the monopoly.
In this case you have a regulation that is
designed to ensure that the monopolist does not extend
its monopoly power into unregulated competitive markets.
And so the -- surely, the regulators focus -- can focus
on the wholesale rates and ensure in this case that the
rate that the monopolist charges itself is the same as
the rate it charges its rivals with the object of
ensuring a competitive downstream market.
But that doesn't mean that that should oust
antitrust law. The regulators may, in fact, think that
it's important to have antitrust law available to
enforce claims in order for them to cut back on their
regulations. And indeed, in this case, when the -- when
AT&T sought to de-tariff its wholesale offering, the
regulators referred to the fact that one of the
justifications for de-tariffing would be that the
antitrust laws would be available in case there were a
problem.
So the -- the relationship between antitrust
and regulation is symbiotic and complementary. And we
would suggest that in this case the mere fact that the
district court determined that the complaint of
insufficient cooperation by the Petitioner in this case
did not state a claim for refusal to deal shouldn't
preclude a -- a price-squeeze claim any more than it
should preclude a predatory pricing claim, which the
government and the Petitioners seem to concede would
still lie.
Now, finally, this point about an
over-deterrence and whether there is any evidence that
any monopolist at any time has ever been deterred from
engaging in legitimate retail price-cutting or efficient
vertical integration, I would submit that there is
absolutely no evidence anywhere in the literature, no
empirical evidence, that there is a problem of over-
deterrence.
And had there been a problem over the last
years that Alcoa has existed, one would think it
wouldn't be too hard to find evidence of that. There is
no evidence.
Furthermore, in Brooke Group the Court did
not simply rely on the risk of over-deterrence as a
basis for holding that above-cost price-cutting was not
actionable. In Brooke Group it relied on two factors:
The fact -- the fear that making above-cost
price-cutting illegal would deter legitimate
price-cutting, but also the fact that above-cost
price-cutting would not eliminate equally efficient
rivals. Any equally efficient rival could meet an
above-cost price. The price squeeze doctrine under the
transfer price test protects equally efficient
downstream rivals.
So that issue is quite different. The
deterrence issue is -- is quite different when you --
when have a price squeeze. Furthermore, the notion that
a monopolist would respond to a price squeeze complaint
-- thank you, Your Honors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your
sentence there.
MR. BRUNELL: The notion that they would
respond to a price squeeze complaint by raising their
retail price, rather than lowering their wholesale
price, I would submit is certainly as belied by the
facts of the Alcoa case which in the district court
reflect that when the government started looking into
the price squeeze and the price squeeze was ended, it
was ended voluntarily by Alcoa lowering its wholesale
price, not raising its retail price.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Now, Mr. Panner, you have two minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON PANNER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PANNER: I have two points I would like
to make. First of all, I think, in agreement with
Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy, and others, I do
think that the presence of a regulatory remedy here is a
critical factor arguing in favor of reversal of the
Ninth Circuit's decision.
The second point that I really want to make
is the importance of clear rules. In the antitrust
context where we are talking about a system of rules
that is going to govern decisionmaking by businesses
where most of those decisions are never going to lead to
litigation or are never going to come before the courts,
it is critically important to have clear rules that
avoid deterring beneficial conduct, that avoid having
the rules themselves harm consumers.
I think that was the point that
Justice Alito and Justice Ginsburg were getting at in
the questioning. It is critical to adopt a decision on
the merits explaining why the Ninth Circuit's price
squeeze decision -- not just here, but in the prior
decision, in City of Anaheim -- is incorrect and
inconsistent with this Court's precedents.
And, more broadly, it is critical to have a
clear rule stating that in the absence of a duty to
deal, an allegation of price squeeze, it doesn't stay a
claim.
And I think that it's also -- would be very
valuable to say that the complaint that was before the
district court -- and the amended complaint at a minimum
is supplying one version of the facts that might try to
be elaborated -- fail to state a claim under this
Court's precedents. The clear gravamen of
that complaint, indeed the explicit gravamen of that
complaint, was that the margin between the wholesale
price and retail price was insufficient. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is now submitted.
(Wherepon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the
