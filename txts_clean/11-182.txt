CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
this morning in Case 11-182, Arizona v. The United
States.
Mr. Clement.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The State of Arizona bears a
disproportionate share of the costs of illegal
immigration. In addressing those costs, Arizona
borrowed the Federal standards as its own and attempted
to enlist state resources in the enforcement of the
uniform Federal immigration laws.
Notwithstanding that, the United States took
the extraordinary step of seeking a preliminary
injunction to enjoin the statute as impliedly preempted
on its face before it took effect. The Ninth Circuit
agreed with respect to four provisions, but only by
inverting fundamental principles of federalism.
The Ninth Circuit, essentially, demanded
that Arizona point to specific authorization in Federal
statute for its approach. But that gets matters
backwards.
A state does not need to point to Federal
authorization for its enforcement efforts. Rather, the
burden is on the parties seeking to preempt a duly
enacted state law to point to some provision in
statutory law that does the preempting. Now, the United
States can't really do that here, and the reason is
obvious.
There are multiple provisions of the Federal
immigration law that go out of their way to try to
facilitate state and local efforts to communicate with
Federal immigration officials, in order to ascertain the
immigration status of individuals.
So, for example, 1373(c) specifically
requires that Federal immigration officials shall
respond to inquiries from state and local officials
about somebody's immigration status. 1373(a) goes even
further. That provision says that no Federal agency or
officer may prohibit or in any way restrict the ability
of state and local officers to communicate with Federal
immigration officers to ascertain somebody's immigration
status.
Indeed, if the DHS had --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement --
MR. CLEMENT: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- could I interrupt?
And turning to 2(B), could you tell me what the state's
view is -- the Government proposes that it should be
read on its face one way, and I think the state is
arguing that there's a narrower way to read it. But am
I to understand that, under the state's position in this
action, the only time that the inquiry about the status
of an individual rises is after they've had probable
cause to arrest that individual for some other crime?
MR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice
Sotomayor. So this only operates when somebody's been,
essentially, stopped for some other infraction. And
then, at that point, if there's reasonable suspicion to
try to identify immigration status, then that can
happen. Of course, one of the things that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I -- can I --
MR. CLEMENT: Sure.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- just stop -- stop you
there just one moment?
That's what I thought. So, presumably, I
think your argument is that, under any circumstance, a
police officer would have the discretion to make that
call. Seems to me that the issue is not about whether
you make the call or not, although the government is
arguing that it might be, but on how long you detain the
individual, meaning -- as I understand it, when
individuals are arrested and held for other crimes,
often, there's an immigration check that most states do
without this law.
And to the extent that the government wants
to remove that individual, they put in a warrant of
detainer. This process is different. How is it
different?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, it's different in one
important respect, Justice Sotomayor, and that's why I
don't think that the issue that divides the parties is
only the issue of how long you can detain somebody
because I think the Federal government takes the rather
unusual position that, even though these stops and these
inquiries, if done on an ad hoc basis, become preempted
if they're done on a systematic basis --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I understand that's
their argument. I can question them about that.
MR. CLEMENT: Okay. But -- so that's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I want to get to
how -- assuming your position, that doing it on
a systematic -- there's nothing wrong with doing it as
it's been done in the past. Whenever anyone is
detained, a call could be made. What I see as critical
is the issue of how long and under -- and when is the
officer going to exercise discretion to release the
person?
MR. CLEMENT: And -- and, with respect, I
don't think Section 2(B) really speaks to that, which is
to say I don't think Section 2(B) says that the
systematic inquiry has to take any longer than the
ad hoc inquiry.
And, indeed, Section 2 -- in one of its
provisions -- specifically says that it has to be
implemented in a way that's consistent with Federal,
both immigration law and civil rights law.
So, there --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens if -- this
is the following call -- the call to the -- to the
Federal government. Yes, he's an illegal alien. No, we
don't want to detain him.
What does the law say -- the Arizona law
say, with respect to releasing that individual?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't know that it
speaks to it in specific terms, but here's what I
believe would happen, which is to say, at that point,
then, the officer would ask themselves whether there's
any reason to continue to detain the person for state
law purposes.
I mean, it could be that the original
offense that the person was pulled over needs to be
dealt with or something like that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm putting all of this
outside of -- of -- the --
MR. CLEMENT: But -- but, if what we're
talking about is simply what happens then, for purposes
of the Federal immigration consequences, the answer is
nothing. The individual, at that point, is released.
And that, I think, can be very well
illustrated by Section 6 -- I don't want to change the
subject unnecessarily, but there is arrest authority for
somebody who has committed a public offense, which means
that it's a crime in another state and in Arizona, but
the person can't be arrested for that offense,
presumably, because they have already served their
sentence for the offense; and then there is new arrest
authority given to the officer to hold that person if
they are deportable for that offense.
Now, I think, in that circumstance, it's
very clear what would happen, is an inquiry would be
made to the Federal officials that would say, do you
want us to transfer this person to your custody or hold
this person until you can take custody? And if the
answer is no, then that's the end of it. That
individual is released because there is no independent
basis in that situation for the state officer to
continue to detain the individual at all.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how would the state
officer know if the person is removable? I mean, that's
sometimes a complex inquiry.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I
think there's two answers to that. One is -- you're
right, sometimes, it's a complex inquiry. Sometimes,
it's a straightforward inquiry. It could be murder. It
could be a drug crime. But I think the practical answer
to the question is, by hypothesis, there is going to be
inquiry made to the Federal immigration authorities,
either the Law Enforcement Support Center or a 287 --
287(g) officer.
And, presumably, as a part of that inquiry,
they can figure out whether or not this is a removable
offense or at least a substantially likely removable
offense.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it takes two weeks
to make that determination, can the alien be held by the
state for that whole period of time --
MR. CLEMENT: Oh, I don't --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just under Section 6?
MR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, Your Honor,
and I think that -- you know, what -- in all of these
provisions, you have the Fourth Amendment backing up the
limits, and I think so --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what would be the
standard? You're -- you're the attorney for the -- the
alien, he -- they are going to hold him for two weeks
until they figure out whether this is a removable
offense. And you say, under the Fourth Amendment, you
cannot hold for -- what? More than a reasonable time
or --
MR. CLEMENT: Yes, ultimately, it's a
reasonable inquiry. And I think that, under these
circumstances, what we know from the record here is
that, generally, the immigration status inquiry is
something that takes 10 or 11 minutes, I mean, so it's
not -- we're not talking about something -- or no more
than 10, if it's a 287(g) officer, and, roughly, 11
minutes on average if it's the Law Enforcement Support
Center.
JUSTICE BREYER: How do they have -- well,
the same question, but -- but I'm trying to think of
examples. Example one is the person is arrested. Now,
it says any person who is arrested shall have the
person's immigration status determined before the person
is released. So I wonder, if they have arrested a
citizen, he's Hispanic-looking. He was jogging. He has
a backpack.  He has water in it and Pedialyte.
So they think, oh, maybe this is an illegal
person. It happens he's a citizen of New Mexico. And
so the driver's license doesn't work.
And, now, they put him in jail. And are
you -- can you represent to us -- I don't know if you
can or not -- can you represent to us he will not stay
in jail, in detention, for a significantly longer period
of time than he would have stayed in the absence of
Section 2(B)?
Do you want to represent that or not?
MR. CLEMENT: I don't want to represent
that --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if you
cannot represent that -- and I'm not surprised you don't
want to -- I mean, I don't know --
MR. CLEMENT: Sure, sure. But what I can
represent --
JUSTICE BREYER: What?
MR. CLEMENT: -- is that he's not going to
be detained any longer than the Fourth Amendment allows.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, fine.
MR. CLEMENT: And --
JUSTICE BREYER: But the Fourth Amendment --
since -- for -- I mean, that's -- that's another
question. I don't know how long the Fourth Amendment
allows. I don't know on that. There probably is a
range of things. But we do know that a person,
ordinarily, for this crime, X, would have been released
after a day.
Oh, you know, the Fourth Amendment would have allowed
more. So, now, what I want to know is what, in
practice, will happen?
You -- from your representation, I think
that there will be a significant number of people --
some of whom won't be arrested. It takes 11 minutes for
some. For citizens, it might take two hours. It might
take two days. Okay. There will be a significant
number of people who will be detained, at the stop or in
prison, for a significantly longer period of time than
in the absence of 2(B).
Is that a fair conclusion?
MR. CLEMENT: I don't think it is, Justice
Breyer, and here's why it's not: Because, even though
there certainly are situations where state authorities
will arrest somebody and then release them relatively
rapidly, they generally don't release somebody until
they can nail down their identity and whether or not
they are likely to come to a court hearing at a
subsequent --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Anyway, if this is a
problem, is it -- is it an immigration law problem?
MR. CLEMENT: It --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Or is it a Fourth Amendment
problem?
MR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, it is
neither --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the Government's attack
on this that it violates the Fourth Amendment?
MR. CLEMENT: No, of course, the Federal
government, that also has a lot of immigration arrests
that are subject to the Fourth Amendment, is not making
a Fourth Amendment claim here. And it's neither an
immigration law concern or something that should be the
basis for striking down a statute on its face.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's a
different argument --
MR. CLEMENT: But I do want to -- but I do
want to be responsive and make the point that I think
the factual premise that this is going to -- 2(B) is
going to lead to the elongation of a lot of arrests is
not true.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Can I make the
following statement in the opinion -- and you will say
that's okay. Imagine -- this is imaginary. "We
interpret" -- imagine -- "we interpret Section 2(B) as
not authorizing or requiring the detention of any
individual under 2(B), either at the stop or in prison,
for a significantly longer period of time than that
person would have been detained in the absence of 2(B)."
Can I make that statement in an opinion, and
you'll say, that's right?
MR. CLEMENT: I think what you could say is
that --
JUSTICE BREYER: But can I say that?
MR. CLEMENT: I don't think you can say just
that.
JUSTICE BREYER: No.
MR. CLEMENT: I think you can say something
similar, though. I think you probably could say that,
look, this is a facial challenge. The statute's never
gone into effect. We don't anticipate that Section 2(B)
would elongate, in a significant number of cases, the
detention or the arrest. I think you could say that.
And the reason is, as I indicated, it's
something that happens even without this law that, when
you arrest somebody -- and there are some offenses that
are -- you can arrest and release under state law, but
before you release the individual, you generally want to
ascertain that that individual is going to show up at
the hearing, and that's what really distinguishes those
cases, where there's arrest and release, from those
cases where there's arrest and you book somebody.
Now, here's the other reason why I don't
think, factually, this is going to elongate things
because, already, in a significant number of booking
facilities in Arizona, you already have the process that
people are systematically run through immigration checks
when they are booked as part of the booking process.
That's reflected in the record here in the Maricopa
County system, that that's done by a 287(g) officer as a
matter of routine.
The Federal government doesn't like this
statute, but they are very proud of their Secure
Communities program. And their Secure Communities
program also makes clear that everybody's that's booked
at participating facilities is -- eventually has their
immigration status checked.
And so I don't think that this immigration
status check is likely to lead to a substantial
elongation of the stops or the detentions. Now,
obviously --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I want to make sure that
I have a clear representation from you. If, at a call
to the Federal agency, the agency says, we don't want to
detain this alien, that alien will be released for --
unless it's under 6, is what you're telling me.
Or under 6, 3, or some -- one other of Arizona's
immigration crimes.
MR. CLEMENT: Exactly. Obviously, if this
is somebody who was going -- you know, 60 miles an hour
in a 20-mile-an-hour school zone or something, they may
decide, wholly apart from the immigration issues, that
this is somebody they want to bring back to the station.
But, for the purposes of once they make the
contact with Federal immigration officials, if the
Federal immigration officials say, look, we have no
interest in removing this person, we have no interest in
prosecuting this person under the Federal criminal
provisions, then that's the end of the Federal case of
the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Then tell
me --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you'll concede that the
-- that the state has to accept within its borders all
people who have no right to be there, that the Federal
government has no interest in removing?
MR. CLEMENT: No, I don't accept that,
Justice Scalia, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's all the
statute -- and you call up the Federal government, and
the Federal government -- yes, he's an illegal
immigrant, but that's okay with us.
MR. CLEMENT: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the state has no
power to -- to close its -- its borders to -- to people
who have no right to be there?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, here, Justice Scalia,
here's my response, which is all of this discussion, at
least as I've understood it, has been about 2(B) and, to
a lesser extent, 6.
Now, Section 3 of the statute does provide
an authority, under state law, to penalize somebody who
has violated, essentially, the Federal registration
requirement. So if that's -- as to that provision,
there would be a state authority, even under these
hypotheticals, to take action with respect to the
individual --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, I think --
MR. CLEMENT: -- but not with respect to
the Federal --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think Justice Scalia's
question was the -- was the broader one, just as a
theoretical matter. Can we say -- or can -- do you take
the position that a state must accept, within its
borders, a person who is illegally present under Federal
law?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, and I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that is by reason of
his alien --
MR. CLEMENT: And I think my answer to that
is no. I think the reason my answer is no has more to
do with our defense of Section 3 and other provisions
than it does with respect to the inquiry and arrest
authority provisions, 2(B) and 6.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, before you move on to
the registration requirement, could I take you back to
an example that's similar to the one that Justice Breyer
was referring to?
Let's someone -- let's say someone who is a
citizen and a resident of New Mexico, has a New Mexico
driver's license, drives across the border, is stopped
for speeding, not 60 miles an hour in a 20-mile zone,
but 10 miles over the speed limit on an interstate. And
the officer, for some reason, thinks that this person
may be an illegal alien. How would that work out?
If you do the records check, you're not
going to get anything back, right, because the person is
a citizen? So what -- where would the officer take it
from there?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, if I can just kind of
work back for a second? I mean, obviously, it's a
pretty unusual circumstance, where somebody produces an
out-of-state driver's license, and that doesn't dispel
reasonable suspicion for the officer. But I'll take the
hypo --
JUSTICE ALITO: Why would it dispel
reasonable suspicion if it's -- if the officer knows
it's a state that issues driver's licenses to aliens who
are not lawfully in that instance --
MR. CLEMENT: And that might be a situation
where that's the case, and then -- then it wouldn't
dispel the reasonable suspicion. But, say, in the
average case, I think it would.
They would then go further. And then they
would then make the inquiry to the Federal officials.
And then if -- because of the fact that the individual
actually is a citizen or something like that, then what
would happen is, at some point, you'd get to the end of
a permissible Terry stop, and the officer would release
the individual.
Now, it might not be the end of the matter
because, of course -- you know, they -- they still have
the name, they still have the ability to collect that
information and try to continue the check as they move
forward, taking down the information on the New Mexico
driver's license.
But I think the important thing is that --
you know, this statute doesn't authorize them to detain
the individual, certainly beyond the -- the Fourth
Amendment limits. And it really doesn't authorize them
to do anything that the official couldn't do on an
ad hoc basis without the statute.
Now, it does do --
JUSTICE ALITO: That -- that may be the
case, and I would like to ask General Verrilli about
that. But, under the Fourth Amendment, presumably, if
the officer can arrest -- the state officer can arrest a
person on -- simply on the ground that the person is
removable, which is what the Office of Legal Counsel
opined some years ago, then, presumably, the officer
could continue to detain that individual that
I mentioned, until they reached a point where the Terry
stop becomes an arrest. At which time, they would have
to have probable cause.
But, if they had probable cause to believe
the person was removable, then they could hold the
person, presumably, until the -- the person's status was
completely verified, isn't that correct?
MR. CLEMENT: I think that's correct,
Your Honor.
Now, as we read Section 6, because there's a
pre-existing definition of public offense in Arizona
law, we don't think this is kind of the -- the full
Office of Legal Counsel situation, where you have broad
arrest authority for removable individuals. This is a
relatively narrow slice of additional arrest authority
that happens to give arrest authority for people that
seem to fit the Federal government's priority because it
really is going to apply to criminal aliens.
But I don't -- I don't take any issue with
what you're saying. I do think, though, it's important
to understand that 2(B) really doesn't give the officer
an authority he didn't otherwise have.
It does do one thing that's very important,
though, which it does have the effect of overriding
local policies that actually forbad some officers from
making those communications and -- because that's one of
the primary effects of 2(B). It just shows how
difficult the government's preemption argument is here
because those kind of local policies are expressly
forbidden by Federal statute. 1373(a) and 8 U.S.C. 1644
basically say that localities can't have those kind of
sanctuary laws.
And so one effect that 2(B) has is, on a
state level, it basically says, look, you can't have
local officers telling you not to make those inquiries.
You must have those inquiries.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could -- does
Section 6 permit an officer to arrest an individual who
has overstayed a visitor's visa by a day? They are
removable, correct?
MR. CLEMENT: They are removable. I don't
think they would have committed a public offense --
absent a very unusual situation, I don't think they
would have committed a public offense under Arizona law.
So I don't think there actually would be arrest
authority in that circumstance, as Justice Alito's
question has -- has --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the definition
of public offense?
MR. CLEMENT: A public offense definition --
it's actually -- it's a petition appendix -- well, I'm
sorry.
The definition is, basically, that it's
something that is a crime in another jurisdiction and
also a crime in Arizona. And so what makes this kind of
anomalous is, normally, if something is a crime in
Arizona, there's arrest authority for that directly.
So what this really captures is people who
have committed a crime are no longer arrestable for the
crime because they have served their sentence or some
other peculiarity, but they are, nonetheless, removable
because of the crime. And so --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, maybe it's
a good time to talk about some of the other sections, in
particular Section 5(C).
Now, that does seem to expand beyond the
Federal government's determination about the types of
sanctions that should govern the employment
relationship.
You talk about supply and demand. The
Federal government, of course, prohibits the employment,
but it also imposes sanctions with respect to
application for work. And the state of Arizona, in this
case, is imposing some significantly greater sanctions.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, it's certainly imposing
different sanctions. I mean -- you know, it's -- it's a
little bit -- kind of hard to weigh the difference
between removability, which is obviously a pretty
significant sanction for an alien, and the relatively
modest penalties imposed by Section 5(C).
But I take the premise that 5(C) does
something that there is no direct analog in Federal law.
But I -- but that -- that's not enough to get you to
preemption, obviously.
And one of the things that makes 5(C), it
seems to us, a weak case for preemption is that it only
targets employment that is expressly forbidden by
Federal law. And so, then we look at -- you know,
essentially, the government is reduced to arguing that
because, in 1986, when Congress passed IRCA, it only
focused on the employer's side of the equation and
didn't, generally speaking, impose restrictions on
employees, that, somehow, they are going to draw a
preemptive inference from that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you agree
that -- would you accept, as a working hypothesis, that
we can begin with the general principle that the Hines
v. Davidowitz language controls here, and we're going to
ask our principal -- our primary function is to
determine whether, under the circumstances of this
particular case, Arizona's law stands as an obstacle to
the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes
and objectives of Congress?
Is -- is that an acceptable test from your
standpoint?
MR. CLEMENT: I think it's an acceptable
test. I mean, Justice Kennedy -- you know, there
obviously have been subsequent cases, including DeCanas
that -- and Whiting, that give additional shape and
color to that test, and -- but I don't have any -- I
don't have any real quarrel with that test.
And here's why I don't think that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but then the
government on this section is going to come and say,
well, there may be -- this must be -- this -- the
enforcement of this statute, as Arizona describes it,
will be in considerable tension with our -- with our
basic approach; isn't that what I'm going to hear from
the government?
MR. CLEMENT: It may be what you're going to
hear, Justice Kennedy, but I don't think you just take
the Federal government for its word on these things.
You know, it's interesting, in DeCanas
itself, the SG said that that California statute was
preempted. And, in DeCanas, this Court didn't say,
well, you know, we've got this language from Hines, and
we have the SG telling us it's preempted, that's good
enough for us. They went beyond that, and they looked
hard.
And what they did is they established that
this is an area where the presumption against preemption
applies. So that seems one strike in our favor.
We have here a situation where there is an
express preemption provision, and it -- it only
addresses the employer's side of the ledger. So the
express preemption provision clearly doesn't apply here.
So the only thing they have is this inference --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, for those of us
for whom legislative history has some importance, there
seems to be quite a bit of legislative history that
the -- that the idea of punishing employees was raised,
discussed, and explicitly rejected.
MR. CLEMENT: Sure. And --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The preemption language
would be geared to what was decided to be punished.
It seems odd to think that the Federal government is
deciding on employment sanctions and has unconsciously
decided not to punish employees.
MR. CLEMENT: But -- but, Justice Sotomayor,
there's a big difference between Congress deciding not
as a matter of Federal law to address employees with an
additional criminal prohibition and saying that that
decision itself has preemptive effect. That's a rather
remarkable additional step.
And here's why I think, if you consider the
legislative history, for those who do, it really
supports us because here's what Congress confronted. I
mean, they started thinking about this problem in 1971.
They passed IRCA in 1986.
At that point, here's the state of the
world: It's already unlawful, as a matter of Federal
law, for the employee to get -- to have this unlawful
work; and, if they seek this unlawful work, they are
subject to removal for doing it.
In addition, Congress was told that most of
the aliens who get this unlawful work are already
here -- they illegally entered, so they are already
subject to an independent criminal offense.
So, at that point, Congress is facing a
world where the employee is already subject to multiple
prohibitions. The employer is completely scot-free as a
matter of Federal law. And so, at that point, in 1986,
they address the employer's side of the equation. They
have an express preemption provision that says nothing
about any intent of preempting the employee's side of
the ledger. And, in that, I don't think --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They did -- they did
provide -- I mean, your position was the Federal
legislation regulates the supply side. That leaves the
demand side open. But there is regulation, and the
question is whether anything beyond that is inconsistent
with the -- the Federal -- it's not just that the person
is removable, but, if they use false documents in
seeking work, that's a Federal crime.
So we have the -- what you call the supply
side is -- is regulated, but you want to regulate it
more.
MR. CLEMENT: Two quick responses, and then
I'd like to save time for rebuttal, Justice Ginsburg.
The first is that, if you look at what they
regulate on the employee's side, it's really things that
actually assist in regulating the employer's side
because what they are worried about is a fraudulent
document that then is used, essentially, to trick the
employer to employing somebody who shouldn't be
employed.
The second thing is the more that you view
IRCA as actually regulating part of the employee's side,
then I think the more persuasive it is that the express
preemption provision doesn't reach the employee's side
of the equation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll give you
plenty of rebuttal time, but I'd like to hear what you
have to say about Section 3 before you sit down.
MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I appreciate the opportunity to do that. I do think, as
to Section 3, the question is really -- it's -- it's a
provision that is parallel to the Federal requirements
and imposes the same punishments as the Federal
requirement.
So it's, generally, not a fertile ground for
preemption. But, of course, there are cases that find
preemption even in those analogous circumstances. They
are the cases that the government is forced to rely on,
cases like Buckman, cases like --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- double
prosecutions be -- suppose that an alien were prosecuted
under Federal law for violating, basically, the terms of
3. Could the states then prosecute him as well?
MR. CLEMENT: I think they could under
general double jeopardy principles and the dual
sovereignty doctrine. Obviously, if that was a
particular concern to you, that might be the basis for
an as-applied challenge, if somebody was already
prosecuted under Federal law.
But, of course, this Court has confronted
exactly that argument, in California against Zook, where
you had the statute of California that prohibited
somebody operating as an interstate carrier without the
ICC license. It was raised -- you know, you have to let
just the Feds enforce that law. Otherwise, there is a
possibility of duplicative punishment, duplicative
prosecution. And this Court rejected that argument
there.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Clement, it
seems that the -- I would think the largest hurdle for
you is Hines, which said the registration scheme --
Congress enacted a complete registration scheme which
the states cannot complement or impose even auxiliary
regulations.
So I don't see the alien registration as a
question of obstacle preemption, but appeal preemption
that alien -- we don't want a competing registration
scheme. We want the registration scheme to be wholly
Federal.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I
think that's part of the reason why I accepted Justice
Kennedy's characterization of the relevant language in
Hines because, although there is some general discussion
there of field preemption, when the Court actually
states what its holding is, it does state it in terms of
obstacle preemption.
And here's where I think there is a critical
difference between what the Court had before it in Hines
and what you have before you here.
In Hines, Pennsylvania passed its statute
before Congress passed the alien registration statute.
So, not surprisingly -- you know, they weren't -- they
weren't soothsayers in Pennsylvania. They couldn't
predict the future. So, when it got up here, there was
a conflict between the provisions of the Pennsylvania
registration law and the Federal registration law. And
this Court struck it down on that preemption basis.
Here it's quite different. Arizona had
before it the Federal statute. It looked at this
precise provision in the Federal statute. It adopted
those standards as its own, and then it imposed parallel
penalties for the violation of the state equivalent.
And so I -- I think the right analysis is
really the analysis that this Court laid out in its
Whiting decision, which says that, in these kinds of
cases, what you look for is whether or not the state
scheme directly interferes with the operation of the
Federal scheme.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you something?
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO: In that regard, we are told
that there are some important categories of aliens who
can't obtain registration -- cannot obtain Federal
registration; and, yet, there are people that nobody
would think should be removed. I think someone with a
pending asylum application would fall into that
category.
How would Section 3 apply there?
MR. CLEMENT: I think it probably wouldn't
apply. There's two provisions that might make it
inapplicable. The first question you'd ask is whether
that individual in that category would be subject to
prosecution under 1304 and 1306. And, if I
understand -- you know, the Government's position, there
are certain people where -- you know, they can't really
get the registration document because of the narrow
class that they are in.
And, as I understand it, it is not a
violation of either 1304 or 1306 to not get a
registration document when you're somebody who can't get
one. So you're not liable for the willful -- willful
failure to get a registration document. And, when you
don't have a registration document to carry, you don't
run afoul of 1306 in the --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, of course, if you've
entered the country illegally, you can't get a
registration.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, sure.
JUSTICE ALITO: And it would -- but --
MR. CLEMENT: But -- but that's not the
narrow class we were talking about.
JUSTICE ALITO: I understand that. I
understand the distinction you're drawing, that you
can't be prosecuted for lack of a registration, if you
couldn't have gotten a registration.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, if you're in -- no, if
you're in the country lawfully, I mean, you can try to
register. And so somebody who enters illegally -- I
mean, they are already guilty of one Federal misdemeanor
by the illegal entry.
JUSTICE ALITO: Right.
MR. CLEMENT: But, at the point that they
stay 30 days and don't try to register, then that's an
independent violation. And so maybe I need to fix what
I said and say, look, if you're somebody who -- if you
did go to register, would be told, you're fine, but we
can't give you a registration document. Then that
individual is not subject to prosecution under the
Federal statute, therefore, wouldn't be subject to
prosecution under the state statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Clement.
General Verrilli.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you get into
what the case is about, I'd like to clear up at the
outset what it's not about. No part of your argument
has to do with racial or ethnic profiling, does it? I
saw none of that in your brief.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Where -- that's correct,
Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So this is
not a case about ethnic profiling.
GENERAL VERRILLI: We're not making any
allegation about racial or ethnic profiling in the case.
Mr. Clement is working hard this morning to
portray SB 1070 as an aid to Federal immigration
enforcement. But the very first provision of the
statute declares that Arizona is pursuing its own policy
of attrition through enforcement and that the provisions
of this law are designed to work together to drive
unlawfully present aliens out of the state.
That is something Arizona cannot do because
the Constitution vests exclusive --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, could you
answer Justice Scalia's earlier question to your
adversary? He asked whether it would be the
Government's position that Arizona doesn't have the
power to exclude or remove -- to exclude from its
borders a person who's here illegally.
GENERAL VERRILLI: That is our position,
Your Honor. It is our position because the Constitution
vests exclusive authority over immigration matters with
the national government.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, all that means -- it
gives authority over naturalization, which we've
expanded to immigration. But all that means is that the
government can set forth the rules concerning who
belongs in this country. But if, in fact, somebody who
does not belong in this country is in Arizona, Arizona
has -- has no power? What -- what does sovereignty mean
if it does not include the ability to defend your
borders?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Your Honor, the -- the
Framers vested in the national government the authority
over immigration because they understood that the way
this nation treats citizens of other countries is a
vital aspect of our foreign relations. The national
government, and not an individual state --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's still up to the
national government. Arizona is not trying to kick out
anybody that the Federal government has not already said
do not belong here. And the Constitution provides --
even -- even with respect to the Commerce Clause -- "No
state shall without the consent of Congress lay any
imposts or duties on imports or exports except," it
says, "what may be absolutely necessary for executing
its inspection laws."
The Constitution recognizes that there is
such a thing as state borders, and the states can police
their borders, even to -- to the point of inspecting
incoming shipments to exclude diseased material.
GENERAL VERRILLI: But they cannot do what
Arizona is seeking to do here, Your Honor, which is to
elevate one consideration above all others. Arizona is
pursuing a policy that -- that maximizes the
apprehension of unlawfully present aliens, so they can
be jailed as criminals in Arizona, unless the Federal
government agrees to direct its enforcement resources to
remove the people that Arizona has identified.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the state does --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a question of
enforcement priorities.
Well, let's say that the government had a
different set of enforcement priorities, and their
objective was to protect, to the maximum extent
possible, the borders. And so anyone who is here
illegally, they want to know about, and they want to do
something about, in other words, different than the
current policy.
Does that mean, in that situation, the
Arizona law would not be preempted?
GENERAL VERRILLI: I think the mandatory
character of the Arizona law and the mandatory character
of the obligations it imposes, in -- especially as
backed by this extraordinary provision in Section 2(H),
which imposes civil penalties of up to $5000 a day on
any official in the state of Arizona who is not
following Section 2 or, as we read it, the rest of SB
1070, to the maximum extent possible, does create a
conflict.
But I do think the most fundamental point
about Section 2 is to understand its relationship to the
other provisions in the statute. Section 2 is in the
statute to identify the class of people who Arizona is
then committed to prosecute under Section 3 and, if they
are employed, also under Section 5.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I have the same
question as the Chief Justice. Suppose that the Federal
government changed its priorities tomorrow, and it
said -- they threw out the ones they have now. And they
said the new policy is maximum enforcement, we want to
know about every person who's stopped or arrested, we
want -- we want to their immigration status verified.
Would -- would the Arizona law then be un-preempted?
GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I think it's still a
problem, Your Honor. These decisions have to be made at
the national level because it's the national government
and not -- it's the whole country and not an individual
state that pays the price --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any example
where -- where enforcement discretion has the effect of
preempting state action?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think we should
think about Section 3 of the law, Your Honor. I think
it will help illustrate the point --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about another
-- another case of ours where we've said that,
essentially, the preemption of state law can occur, not
by virtue of the Congress preempting, but because the
executive doesn't want this law enforced so -- so
rigorously, and that preempts the state from enforcing
it vigorously.
Do we have any case that says that?
GENERAL VERRILLI: I think the preemption
here -- focusing for a moment on Section 3 -- the
preemption here flows from judgments of Congress, from
the registration system that Congress set up in Sections
1301 through 1306, from the decision of Congress in
Section 1103 in the law to vest the Secretary of DHS and
the Attorney General with the authority to make the
judgments about how this law is going to be enforced --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they do that with
all -- with all Federal criminal statutes. And you
acknowledge that, as a general matter, states can
enforce Federal criminal law, which is always entrusted
to the Attorney General.
GENERAL VERRILLI: They -- they can make --
they can engage in detention, in support of the
enforcement of Federal law. That's what the OLC opinion
from 2002 says. It does not say that they can prosecute
under Federal law and make their own decisions. That's
a far different matter.
And it really goes to the heart, I think, of
what's wrong with Section 3 of this Act, in that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you say
that the Federal government has to have control over who
to prosecute, but I don't see how Section 2(B) says
anything about that at all. All it does is notify the
Federal government, here's someone who is here
illegally, here's someone who is removable. The
discretion to prosecute for Federal immigration offenses
rests entirely with the Attorney General.
GENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct, but, with
respect to -- and I will -- let me address something
fundamental about Section 2. That is true, but I -- I
think it doesn't get at the heart of the problem here.
The -- Section 1 of this statute says that
Sections 2 and 3 and 5 are supposed to work together to
achieve this policy of attrition through enforcement.
And so what Section 2 does is identify a population that
the state of Arizona is going to prosecute under Section
3 and Section 5 --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So, apart
from Section 3 and Section 5, take those off the table,
you have no objection to Section 2?
GENERAL VERRILLI: We do, Your Honor. But,
before I take 3 and 5 off the table, if I could make one
more point about 3 and 5, please? The -- I think --
because I think it's important to understand the dilemma
that this puts the Federal government in.
Arizona has got this population, and
they've -- and they're, by law, committed to maximum
enforcement. And so the Federal government's got to
decide, are we going to take our resources, which we
deploy for removal, and are we going to use them to deal
with this population, even if it is to the detriment of
our priorities --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly. You -- the
Federal government has to decide where it's going to use
its resources.
And what the state is saying, here are
people who are here in violation of Federal law, you
make the decision. And if your decision is you don't
want to prosecute those people, fine, that's entirely up
to you. That's why I don't see the problem with Section
(B).
GENERAL VERRILLI: Here's the other
half -- here's the other half of the equation, Mr. Chief
Justice, which is that they say, if you're not going to
remove them, we are going to prosecute them. And that
means that the -- and I think this does get at the heart
of why this needs to be an exclusive national power --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only under Section 3
and Section 5.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, but those are -- but
what you're talking about is taking somebody whose --
whose only offense is being unlawfully present in the
country and putting them in jail for up to 6 months, or
somebody who --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's
say you're worried about --
GENERAL VERRILLI: -- or like 30 days,
forgive me. 6 months for employment.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
Right.
For the notification, what could possibly be
wrong, if Arizona arrests someone, let's say for drunk
driving, and their policy is you're going to stay in
jail overnight, no matter what, okay? What's wrong,
during that period, by having the Arizona arresting
officer say, I'm going to call the Federal agency and
find out if this person is here illegally because the
Federal law says the Federal agency has to answer my
question.
It seems an odd argument to say the Federal
agency has to answer the state's question, but the state
can't ask it.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, we're not saying
the state can't ask it in any individual case. We -- we
recognize that section --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think there are
individual cases in which the state can call the Federal
government and say, is this person here illegally?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, certainly, but that
doesn't make --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So doesn't
that defeat the facial challenge to the Act?
GENERAL VERRILLI: No. I don't think so,
Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- I think the problem
here is in that -- is in every circumstance, as a result
of Section 2(B) of the law, backed by the penalties of
section 2(H), the state official must pursue the
priorities that the state has set, irrespective of
whether they are helpful to or in conflict with the
Federal priorities. And so --
JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that
every -- suppose every law enforcement officer in
Arizona saw things exactly the same way as the Arizona
legislature. And so, without any direction from the
legislature, they all took it upon themselves to make
these inquiries every time they stopped somebody or
arrested somebody.
Would that be a violation of Federal law?
GENERAL VERRILLI: No, it wouldn't be,
Your Honor, because, in that situation, they would be
free to be responsive to Federal priorities, if the
Federal officials came back to them and said, look, we
need to focus on gangs, we need to focus on this drug
problem at the border --
JUSTICE ALITO: But what if they said, well,
we don't care what your priorities are; we -- we have
our priorities, and our priority is maximum enforcement,
and we're going to call you in every case? It was all
done on an individual basis, all the officers were
individually doing it --
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well -- yes, well --
JUSTICE ALITO: -- that would be okay?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, if there's a -- if
there's a state policy locked into law by statute,
locked into law by regulation, then we have a problem.
If it's not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, I am having --
GENERAL VERRILLI: -- the line is mandatory
versus discretionary --
JUSTICE ALITO: That's what I can't
understand because your argument -- you seem to be
saying that what's wrong with the Arizona law is that
the Arizona legislature is trying to control what its
employees are doing, and they have to be free to
disregard the desires of the Arizona legislature, for
whom they work, and follow the priorities of the Federal
government, for whom they don't work.
GENERAL VERRILLI: But they -- but, with
respect to immigration enforcement, and to the extent
all they're doing is bringing people to the Federal
Government's attention, they are cooperating in the
enforcement of Federal law --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the hypothetical is
that that's all the legislature is doing.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, except I think,
Justice Kennedy, the problem is that it's not
cooperation if, in every instance, the officers in the
state must respond to the priorities set by the state
government and are not free to respond to the priorities
of the Federal officials who are trying to enforce the
law in the most effective manner possible.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm a little
confused -- general, I'm terribly confused by your
answer. Okay? And -- and I don't know that you're
focusing in on what I believe my colleagues are trying
to get to.
Making the -- 2(B) has two components, as I
see it. Every person that's suspected of being an alien
who's arrested for another crime -- that's what
Mr. Clement says the statute means -- the officer has to
pick up the phone and call -- and call the agency to
find out if it's an illegal alien or not.
He tells me that, unless there's another
reason to arrest the person -- and that's 3 and 6, or
any of the other provisions -- but putting those aside,
we're going to stay just in 2(B), if the government
says, we don't want to detain the person, they have to
be released for being simply an illegal alien, what's
wrong with that?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Taking out the other
provisions, taking out any independent state-created
basis of liability for being an -- an illegal alien?
GENERAL VERRILLI: I think there are three.
The first is the -- the Hines problem of harassment.
Now, we are not making an allegation of
racial profiling; nevertheless, there are already tens
of thousands of stops that result in inquiries in
Arizona, even in the absence of SB 1070. It stands to
reason that -- that the legislature thought that that
wasn't sufficient and there needed to be more.
And it -- given that you have a population
in Arizona of 2 million Latinos, of whom only 400,000,
at most, are there unlawfully, there --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Sounds like racial
profiling to me.
GENERAL VERRILLI: And they're -- and given
that what we're talking about is the status of being
unlawfully present, which --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have the
statistics as to how many arrests there are and how
many -- and what the -- percentage of calls before the
statute?
GENERAL VERRILLI: There is some evidence in
the record, Your Honor. It's the -- the Palmatier
declaration, which is in the Joint Appendix, was the --
he was the fellow who used the run the Law Enforcement
Support Center, which answers the inquiries. That --
that declaration indicates that, in fiscal year 2009,
there were 80,000 inquiries and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What does this have to do
with Federal immigration law? I mean, it may have to do
with -- with racial harassment, but I thought you
weren't relying on that.
GENERAL VERRILLI: The --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you objecting to
harassing the -- the people who have no business being
here? Is that -- surely, you're -- you're not concerned
about harassing them. They have been stopped anyway,
and all you're doing is calling up to see if they are
illegal immigrants or not.
So you must be talking about other people
who have nothing to do with -- with our immigration
laws. Okay? Citizens and -- and other people, right?
GENERAL VERRILLI: And other -- and other
people lawfully present in the country, certainly, but
this is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that has nothing to do
with the immigration law --
GENERAL VERRILLI: Hines is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which is -- which is
what you're asserting preempts all of this activity.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Hines identified this
problem as harassment as -- as a central feature of
preemption under the immigration laws because of the
concern that the way this nation treats citizens of
other countries is fundamental to our foreign relations.
And this is a --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, let's -- let me just
go back because I think -- I'm trying to get focused the
question, I think, others are asking. And one way to
focus it is the same question I asked Mr. Clement.
Think of 2(B), the first sentence. All
right?
Now, I can think -- I'm not saying they are
right -- but, if that means you're going to hold an
individual longer than you would have otherwise, I can
think of some arguments that it is preempted and some
replies. So keep that out of it.
Suppose that we were to say, that sentence,
as we understand it, does not raise a constitutional
problem as long as it is interpreted to mean that the
policeman, irrespective of what answer he gets from ICE,
cannot detain the person for longer than he would have
done in the absence of this provision.
Now, in your view, is there any preemption
exemption -- argument against -- any preemption argument
against that sentence as I have just interpreted it? I
don't know what your answer is, and that's why I'm
asking.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. I -- we would
think it would ameliorate --
JUSTICE BREYER: And if so, what?
GENERAL VERRILLI: -- it would ameliorate
the practical problem. But there is still a structural
problem here in that this is an effort to enforce
Federal law. And the -- under the Constitution, it's
the President and the Executive Branch that are
responsible for the enforcement of Federal law --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is --
GENERAL VERRILLI: -- and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is not an effort
to enforce Federal law. It is an effort to let you know
about violations of Federal law. Whether or not to
enforce them is still entirely up to you. If you don't
want to do this, you just tell the person at LESC -- if
that's the right -- is that the right acronym?
GENERAL VERRILLI: It is, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- LESC, look, when
somebody from Arizona calls, answer their question, and
don't even bother to write it down. Okay? I stopped
somebody else, is he legal or illegal, let me check --
it's -- oh, he's illegal. Okay. Thanks. Good-bye.
I mean, why -- it is still your decision.
And, if you don't want to know who is in this country
illegally, you don't have to.
GENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct. But the
process of -- the process of cooperating to enforce the
Federal immigration law starts earlier. And it starts
with the process of making the decisions about who to --
who to stop, who to apprehend, who to check on. And the
problem -- the structural problem we have is that those
decisions -- in the making of those decisions, Arizona
officials are not free --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under 2(B), the
person is already stopped for some other reason. He's
stopped for going 60 in a 20. He's stopped for drunk
driving. So that decision to stop the individual has
nothing to do with immigration law at all. All that has
to do with immigration law is the -- whether or not they
can ask the Federal government to find out if this
person is illegal or not and then leave it up to you.
It seems to me that the Federal government
just doesn't want to know who is here illegally or not.
GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I -- I don't think
that's right. I think we want to be able to cooperate
and focus on our priorities.
And one thing that's instructive in that
regard, Mr. Chief Justice, are the declarations put into
the record by the police chiefs from Phoenix and Tucson,
both of whom I think explain effectively why SB -- the
Section 2(B) obligation gets in the way of the mutual
effort to -- to focus on the priorities of identifying
serious criminals, so that they can be removed from the
country.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Anyway, what -- what's
wrong about the states enforcing Federal law? There is
a Federal law against robbing Federal banks. Can it be
made a state crime to rob those banks? I think it is.
GENERAL VERRILLI: I think it could, but I
think that's quite --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But does the Attorney
General come in and say, you know, we might really only
want to go after the professional bank robbers? If it's
just an amateur bank robber, you know, we're -- we're
going to let it go. And the state's interfering with
our -- with our whole scheme here because it's
prosecuting all these bank robbers.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, of course, no one
would --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, would anybody listen
to that argument?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Of course not.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course not.
GENERAL VERRILLI: But this argument is
quite different, Justice Scalia, because here what we
are talking about is that Federal registration
requirement in an area of dominant Federal concern --
exclusive Federal concern, with respect to immigration,
who can be in the country, under what circumstances, and
what obligations they have --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, are you talking about
3 now or --
GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- or does this argument
relate to 2 as well?
GENERAL VERRILLI: This is an argument about
Section 3.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could I ask you this
about 2, before you move on to that? How is a -- this
is just a matter of information. How can a state
officer who stops somebody or who arrests somebody for a
nonimmigration offense tell whether that person falls
within the Federal removal priorities without making an
inquiry to the Federal government?
For example, I understand one of the
priorities is people who have previously been removed,
then that might be somebody who you would want to arrest
and -- and remove. But how can you determine that
without making the -- the inquiry in the first place?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, in any individual
case, that's correct. You -- you would need to make the
inquiry in the first place. It won't always be correct,
if you're arresting somebody based on probable cause
that they have committed a serious crime, and they --
and they -- the inquiry into whether -- into their
status will be enough to identify that person for
priority --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if they just --
they stop somebody for a traffic violation, but they
want to know whether this is a person who previously was
removed and has come back or somebody who has just --
just within the last few hours, possibly, come -- well,
let's just -- somebody who's previously been removed.
How can you know that, without making an inquiry?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think -- I think
it's correct that you can't, but there is a -- there is
difference, Justice Alito, I think, between the question
of any individual circumstance and a mandatory policy
backed by this civil fine, that you've got to make the
inquiry in every case.
I think it's as though, if I can use an
analogy, if you ask one of your law clerks to bring you
the most important preemption cases from the last 10
years, and they rolled in the last -- the last hundred
volumes of the U.S. Reports and said, well, they are in
there. That -- that doesn't make it --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if
they just rolled in Whiting?
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a pretty good
one.
JUSTICE BREYER: Look, in the Federal
statute, it says in 1373 that nobody can prohibit or
restrict any government entity from making this inquiry
of the Federal government. And then it says that the
Federal government has -- any agency -- and then it says
the Federal government has an obligation to respond.
Now, assuming the statute were limited, as I
say, so nothing happened to this individual, nothing
happened to the person who's stopped that wouldn't have
happened anyway, all that happens is the person -- the
policeman makes a phone call. Now, that's what I'm
trying to get at.
If that were the situation, and we said it
had to be the situation, then what in the Federal
statute would that conflict with, where we have two
provisions that say any policeman can call?
GENERAL VERRILLI: So --
JUSTICE BREYER: What's the -- that's --
that's where I'm trying to push you.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Because, in my mind, I'm
not clear what your answer is to that.
GENERAL VERRILLI: I think -- I understand
the question. And I think the answer is this: 1373 was
enacted in 1996, along with 1357. And 1357 is the
provision that sets forth the powers and authorities of
Federal immigration officials.
It contains 1357(g), which effectively says
that Federal -- that the Federal government, the
Attorney General, can deputize state officials, so long
as they're -- they obtain adequate training, and they
are subject to the direction and control of the Attorney
General in carrying out immigration functions.
Then the last provision, (g)(10), says that
nothing that we've said so far should be read to -- to
preclude informal cooperation, communication or other
informal cooperation in the apprehension, detention, and
removal of unlawfully present persons, but it's the
focus on cooperation.
And I think you have to -- so I don't think
you can read into 1373 the -- the conclusion that what
Congress was intending to do was to shift from the
Federal government to the states the authority to set
enforcement priorities because I think the cooperation
in this context is cooperation in the service of the
Federal enforcement.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I get to a different
question? I think even I or someone else cut you off
when you said there were three reasons why -- 2(B).
Putting aside your argument that this --
that a systematic cooperation is wrong -- you can see
it's not selling very well. Why don't you try to come
up with something else?
Because I, frankly -- as the Chief has said
to you, it's not that it's forcing you to change your
enforcement priorities. You don't have to take the
person into custody. So what's left of your argument?
GENERAL VERRILLI: So let me -- let me just
summarize what I think the three are, and then maybe I
can move on to sections 3 and 5.
The -- with respect to -- with respect to 2,
we think the harassment argument -- we think this is a
more significant harassment problem than was present in
Hines --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- please move more --
GENERAL VERRILLI: With respect to -- in
addition, we do think that there is a structural
accountability problem, in that they are enforcing
Federal law, but not answerable to the Federal
officials.
And, third, we do think there are practical
impediments, in that the -- the result of this is to
deliver to the Federal system a volume of inquiries that
makes it harder and not easier to identify who the
priority persons are for removal.
So those are the three reasons.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, you have
been trying valiantly to get us to focus on Section 3,
so maybe we should let you do that now.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice.
The -- I do think the key thing about
Section 3 is that we -- is that Section 3 is purporting
to enforce a Federal registration requirement. That's a
relationship between the alien and the United States
government that's exclusively a Federal relationship.
It's governed by the terms of 1301 through 1306.
And the way in which those terms are
enforced does have very significant Federal interest at
its heart. And there is no state police power interest
in that Federal registration relationship.
And I do think -- I think it's very
important -- Justice Alito raised the question of these
categories of people. I think it's -- it is quite
important to get clarity on that.
The -- if you are -- if you have come into
the country unlawfully, but you have a pending
application for asylum, a pending application for
temporary protective status, because you -- you would
have to be removed to a country to which you can't be
removed, because of the conditions in the country, if
you have a valid claim for relief under the Violence
Against Women Act based on your treatment, if you have a
valid claim for relief because you are a victim of human
trafficking, if you have a valid claim for relief
because you are the victim of a crime or a witness to a
crime, all of those persons are in technical violation
of 1306(a).
And -- and it seems to me. They -- they are
in violation of 1306(a), so my friend, Mr. Clement, just
is not correct in saying that those are people who
aren't in violation of 1306(a) and, therefore, aren't in
violation of -- of Section 3. They are in violation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe 1306(a) ought
to be amended, then. I mean, we have statutes out there
that there a lot of people in violation of it and --
well, the Attorney General will take care of it. Is
that how we write our criminal laws?
GENERAL VERRILLI: But -- but it's a
situation in which no reasonable person would think that
the individual ought to be prosecuted. And, yet, very
often, the states aren't even going to know, in fact,
about asylum status. They can't know because there are
regulations that require that to be kept private, to
avoid retaliation against the person making the
application.
And so, this -- so this is -- this is, I
think, a very strong illustration of why the enforcement
discretion over Section 3 needs to be vested exclusively
in the Federal government.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Again, I ask you, do you
have any other case in which the basis for preemption
has been you are interfering with -- with the Attorney
General's enforcement discretion?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, this is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's an
extraordinary basis for saying that the state is
preempted.
GENERAL VERRILLI: I think what is
extraordinary about this, actually, Justice Scalia, is
the state's decision to enact a statute purporting to
criminalize the violation of a Federal registration
obligation. And I think that's the problem here. And
they are doing it for a reason --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not criminalizing
anything that isn't criminal under Federal law.
GENERAL VERRILLI: But -- but what --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's the bank.
It's the Federal bank example --
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a state law, which
criminalizes the same thing that the Federal law does.
GENERAL VERRILLI: I think it's quite
different.
What they are doing here is using 1306(a) to
get at the status of unlawful presence. The only people
who can be prosecuted under Section 3 are people who are
unlawfully present in the country. That's what the
statute says. And they are using it to get at that
category of people, to, essentially, use their state
criminal law to perform an immigration function.
And the immigration function is to try to --
to prosecute these people. And, by the way, you can
prosecute somebody, they can be put in jail for 30 days
here. But, under Federal law, a violation of 1306(a) is
a continuing offense.
So the day they get out of jail for that 30
days, they can be arrested again. And this can happen
over and over again. And the point of this provision is
to drive unlawfully present people out of the state of
Arizona.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose --
well, assume these are two hypothetical -- two
hypothetical instances.
First, the Federal government has said, we
simply don't have the money or the resources to enforce
our immigration laws the way we wish. We wish we could
do so, but we don't have the money or the resources.
That's the first -- just hypothetical.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You said that in your
brief, didn't you?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Also -- also hypothetical
is that the state of Arizona has -- has a massive
emergency with social disruption, economic disruption,
residents leaving the state because of flood of
immigrants. Let's just assume those two things.
Does that give the state of Arizona any
powers or authority or legitimate concerns that any
other state wouldn't have?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Of course, they have
legitimate concerns in that situation. Justice
Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And can they go to their
legislature and say, we're concerned about this, and ask
the legislature to enact laws to correct this problem?
GENERAL VERRILLI: They -- they certainly
can enact laws of general application. They can enforce
the laws of general application that are on the books.
They already -- as a result of 8 U.S.C. 1621, it's clear
that they are under no obligation to provide any state
benefits to the -- the population.
But I think, most importantly, they can --
can -- not most importantly, but as importantly, they
can engage in cooperative efforts with the Federal
government -- excuse me. I see my --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, keep going.
GENERAL VERRILLI: They can -- they can
engage in cooperative efforts with the Federal
government, of which there are many going on in Arizona
and around the country, in order to address these
problems.
JUSTICE SCALIA: General, didn't you say in
your brief -- I forget where it was -- I thought you
said that the Justice Department doesn't get nearly
enough money to enforce our immigration laws? Didn't
you say that?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Of course, we have to set
priorities. There are only --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. Okay. So the
state says, well, that may be your priorities, but most
of these people that you're not going after -- or an
inordinate percentage of them, are here in our state,
and we don't like it. They are causing all sorts of
problems. So we're going to help you enforce Federal
law. We're not going to do anything else. We're just
enforcing Federal law.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well -- well, what I
think they are going to do in Arizona is something quite
extraordinary, that has significant real and practical
foreign relations effects. And that's the problem, and
it's the reason why this power needs to be vested
exclusively in the Federal government.
They -- what they are going to do is engage,
effectively, in mass incarceration because the
obligation under Section 2(H), of course, is not merely
to enforce Section 2 to the fullest possible extent at
the -- at the risk of civil fine, but to enforce Federal
immigration law, which is what they claim they are doing
in Section 3 and in Section 5.
And so -- so you're going to have a
situation of mass incarceration of people who are
unlawfully present. That is going to raise -- poses a
very serious risk of raising significant foreign
relations problems.
And these problems are real. It is the
problem of reciprocal treatment of the
United States citizens in other countries.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're saying the
government has a legitimate interest in not enforcing
its laws?
GENERAL VERRILLI: No. We have a legitimate
interest in enforcing the law, of course, but it needs
to be -- but these -- this Court has said, over and over
again, has recognized that the -- the balance of
interest that has to be achieved in enforcing the -- the
immigration laws is exceedingly delicate and complex,
and it involves consideration of foreign relations, it
involves humanitarian concerns, and it also involves
public order and public safety.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, when -- when --
I know your brief, you had -- you said that there are
some illegal aliens who have a right to remain here.
And I'm just realizing that I don't really know what
happens when the Arizona police call the Federal agency.
They give the Federal agency a name, correct?
GENERAL VERRILLI: I assume so, yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, you don't really
have knowledge of what --
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, they -- I mean, it
can come in lots of different ways, but, generally, they
will get a name and some other identifying information.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And what
does the computer have? What information does your
system have?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. So the way this
works is there is a system for -- for incoming
inquiries. And then there is a person at a computer
terminal. And that person searches a number of
different databases. There are eight or ten different
databases, and that person will check the name against
this one, check the name against that one, check the
name against the other one, to see if there are
any hits.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how does that
database tell you that someone is illegal, as opposed to
a citizen?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Today, if you use the
names Sonia Sotomayor, they would probably figure out I
was a citizen.
(Laughter.)
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's assume it's
John Doe, who lives in Grand Rapids.
GENERAL VERRILLI: The citizen problem is
actually -- yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they are legal. Is
there a citizen database?
GENERAL VERRILLI: The citizen problem is
actually a significant problem. There isn't a citizen
database. If you --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. There is or
there isn't?
GENERAL VERRILLI: There is not. If you
have a passport, there is a database if you look
passports. So you could be discovered that way. But,
otherwise, there is no reliable way in the database to
verify that you are a citizen, unless you are in the
passport database. So you have lots of circumstances in
which people who are citizens are going to come up no
match.
There's no -- there is nothing suggesting in
the databases that they have an immigration problem of
any kind, but there's nothing to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the guy who is -- so
if you run out of your house without your driver's
license or identification and you walk into a park
that's closed and you're arrested, you -- they make the
call to this agency. You could sit there forever while
they --
you're --
GENERAL VERRILLI:
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
GENERAL VERRILLI:
Yes, and I --
-- figure out if
While I'm at it, there is
a factual point I think I'd like to correct.
Mr. Clement suggested that it takes 10 minutes to
process these calls. That's true, but you're in a queue
for 60 minutes before it takes the 10 minutes to process
the call. So the average time is 70 minutes, not 10
minutes. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I had a little --
wasn't sure about your answer to Justice Kennedy.
Is the reason that the government is not
focused on people who are here illegally, as opposed to
the other categories you were talking about, because of
prioritization or because of lack of resources?
You suggested that if the -- every illegal
alien that you identify is either removed or prosecuted,
that that would cause tensions with other governments.
So I -- I don't understand if it's because you don't
have enough resources or because you don't want to
prosecute the people who are simply here illegally, as
opposed to something else.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, it's a little more
complicated than that. I think the -- the point is
this: That with respect to persons who are unlawfully
present, there are some who are going to fall in our
priority categories. There are those who have committed
serious offenses. There are those who have been removed
and have come back. And there are other priority
categories.
Because we have resource constraints and
there are only so many beds in the detention centers and
only so many immigration judges, we want to focus on
those priority categories, find them, remove them.
There is a second category, and that is,
individuals who are here in violation, technically, of
1306(a), but who have a valid asylum application or
application for temporary protected status or other --
and, with respect to those persons that we think
would -- it's affirmatively harmful to think that they
ought to be prosecuted.
And then there is an additional category of
people who are not in the second category and not
priorities, and the form and we think there, the idea
that an individual state will engage in a process of
mass incarceration of that population, which we do think
is what Section 2(H) commits Arizona to do under Section
, raises a significant foreign relations problem.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't you avoid that
particular foreign relations problem by simply deporting
these people? Free them from the jails --
GENERAL VERRILLI: Look -- I really think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And send them back to the
countries that are -- that are objecting.
GENERAL VERRILLI: This is a -- this is a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the problem with
that?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, a couple of things.
First is I don't think it's realistic to assume that the
aggressive enforcement of Sections 3 and 5 in Arizona is
going to lead to a mass migration back to countries of
origin. It seems a far more likely outcome is going to
be migration to other states. And that's a significant
problem. That's part of the reason why this problem
needs to be managed on a national basis.
Beyond that, I do think, you know, the --
it's worth bearing in mind here that the country of
Mexico is in a central role in this situation.
Between 60 and 70 percent of the people that
we remove every year, we remove to Mexico. And, in
addition, we have to have the cooperation of the
Mexicans. And I think, as the Court knows from other
cases, the cooperation of the country to whom we are --
to which we are removing people who are unlawfully
present is vital to be able to make removal work.
In addition, we have very significant issues
on the border with Mexico. And, in fact, they are the
very issues that Arizona is complaining about, in
that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So we -- we have to -- we
have to enforce our laws in a manner that will please
Mexico? Is that what you're saying?
GENERAL VERRILLI: No, Your Honor, but what
it does -- no, Your Honor, I'm not saying that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It sounded like what you
were saying.
GENERAL VERRILLI: No, but what I am saying
is that this points up why the Framers made this power
an exclusive national power. It's because the entire
country feels the effects of a decision -- conduct by an
individual state. And that's why the -- the power needs
to be exercised at the national level and not the state
level.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And your concern is
the problems that would arise in bilateral relations if
you remove all of these people -- or a significant
percentage or a greater percentage than you are now.
Nothing in the law requires you to do that.
All it does is lets you know where -- that
an illegal alien has been arrested, and you can decide,
we are not going to initiate removal proceedings against
that individual. It doesn't require you to remove one
more person than you would like to remove under your
priorities.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Right, but the problem
I'm focused on -- we're focused on, Mr. Chief Justice,
is not our removal decisions, but Arizona's decision to
incarcerate, and the foreign relations problem that that
raises. That's why this power has got to be exercised
at the national level.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that -- and that
arises under 3 and 5?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not 2?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, 2 -- 2 identifies
the population that's going to be prosecuted under 3 and
5.
I haven't -- I've been up here a long time.
I haven't said anything about Section 5 yet.  And I
don't want to tax the Court's patience, but if I could
spend a minute on Section 5?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Section 5.
GENERAL VERRILLI: The -- I do think the
fundamental point about Section 5 here is that, in 1986,
Congress fundamentally changed the landscape. Congress
made a decision in 1986 to make the employment of aliens
a central concern of national immigration policy. And
this Court has described the 1986 law as a comprehensive
regime.
Now, what my friend, Mr. Clement, says, is
that it may be a comprehensive regime for employers;
it's not a comprehensive regime for employees. And,
therefore, it's -- there ought not be any inference here
that the states are precluded from criminalizing efforts
to seek or obtain employment in Arizona.
But I really think that's not right.
The -- employment is one problem. And Congress tackled
the problem of employment and made a decision -- a
comprehensive decision, about this -- the sanctions it
thought were appropriate to govern. And Congress did,
as Justice Ginsburg suggested, make judgments with
respect to the circumstances under which employees could
be held criminally liable, as well as the circumstances
under which employers could be held liable.
And I think it is useful, in thinking about
the judgments Congress actually made --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- think field preemption;
is that your argument with respect to this section?
GENERAL VERRILLI: It's -- it's both. I
think we're making both a field and a conflict
preemption argument here, Justice Scalia. And the --
and the -- I think it's worth examining the specific
judgments Congress made in 1986.
On the employer's side -- and, after all,
this is a situation in which the concern here is that
the employer is in a position of being the exploiter and
the -- the alien of being the exploited -- on the
employer's side, Congress said that states may not
impose criminal sanctions, and even -- and the Federal
government will not impose criminal sanctions for the
hiring of employees, unless there's a pattern or
practice.
It seems quite incongruous to think that
Congress, having made that judgment and imposed those
restrictions on the employer's side, would have left
states free to impose criminal liability on employees
merely for seeking work, for doing what you, I think,
would expect most otherwise law-abiding people to do,
which is to find a job, so they can feed their families.
So I think that's -- that's a significant problem.
The -- in addition, Congress made clear in
the law that the I-9 form could not be used for any
other purpose than prosecutions for violation of the
Federal antifraud requirements. And, if Congress wanted
to leave states free to impose criminal sanctions on
employees for seeking work, they wouldn't have done
that, it seems to me.
So there, I think there are strong
indicators in the text that Congress did make a
judgment, and the judgment was this far and no farther.
And it's reasonable that Congress would have done so,
for the same kinds of foreign relations concerns that I
was discussing with -- with respect to Section 3. It
would be an extraordinary thing to put someone in jail
merely for seeking work. And, yet, that's what Arizona
proposes to do under Section 5 of its law.
Now, of course, there is an express
preemption provision, but the express preemption
provision, as this Court has said many times, does not
operate to the exclusion of implied preemption, field or
conflict. So we do think those principles apply here.
We think there's a reason why the express
preemption provision was limited to the employer's side,
which is that, after DeCanas, laws had been enacted on
the employer's side, and with -- Congress was making
clear that those were preemptive, there were no laws on
the employee's side at the time and, therefore, no
reason for preemption.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Clement,
minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
I'd like to start, briefly, with the
enforcement issues and then talk about the other
provisions. The last thing I'll say about the
enforcement provision, since I do think that the
Government's rather unusual theory that something that's
okay when done ad hoc becomes preempted when it's
systematic. I think that theory largely refutes itself.
But I will say one thing, which is to just
echo that there is no interference with enforcement
priorities by simply giving the Federal government
information on which to bring their enforcement
priorities to bear. And this is really illustrated by a
point this Court made in its Florence decision earlier
this month, which is that, sometimes, you pull somebody
over for the most innocuous of infractions, and they
turn out to be the most serious of offenders.
And so if you preclude officers, as happened
in Phoenix, from communicating with the Federal
government, the Federal government will not be able to
identify the worst of the worst. And if you want an
example of this, look at the declaration of Officer
Brett Glidewell at Joint Appendix 183 to 186. He pulled
somebody over in a routine traffic stop and was shot by
the individual.
Now, the individual, it turns out, was
wanted for attempted murder in El Salvador and was also
guilty of illegal reentry into the United States. He
was stopped on three previous occasions and his status
was not verified. Now, if it had been, he certainly
would have been apprehended. In at least two of the
stops, his immigration status wasn't checked because of
the city policy, city of Phoenix.
Now, if the state, I submit, can do
anything, it can, at the state level, override those
kind of local policies and say, that's not what we want.
Community policing is all well and good, but we want to
maximize communication with the Federal authorities. So
I think the enforcement policy and priorities argument
simply doesn't work.
As to Section 3, two points about that, one
is, I respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General
as to whether the various things that he led off -- read
off, the litany of situations where somebody is --
technically doesn't have registration would be a
violation of 1306(a).
And the reason I take that position is that
provision says a willful failure to register. Now,
maybe the prosecutors take the view that there is
willfulness in those circumstances, but I don't think
many judges would. I think they would say that, if
you've been told by the Federal government that you're
perfectly fine here and you don't need to register, that
that would be good enough to defeat a finding of
willfulness. So I don't think 1306(a) covers this case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're inviting --
you're inviting the very sort of conflict that he's
talking about because what's going to happen, now, is
that, if there is no statement by the Federal agency of
legality, the person is arrested, and, now, we're going
to have Federal resources spent on trying to figure out
whether they have an asylum application, whether they
have this, whether they have that, whether they are
exempted under this reason, whether the failure to carry
was accidental or not -- I mean, you are involving the
Federal government in your prosecution.
MR. CLEMENT: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, you may say we're
not because all we're going to show is -- what? That we
got a Federal call -- we got a Federal answer that the
person wasn't registered?
MR. CLEMENT: No, we're going to say that we
communicated with the Federal immigration officials, and
they told us this is somebody who's perfectly fine and
doesn't have to register. The --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No -- no
Confrontation -- no Confrontation Clause problem with
that? With relying on a call to a Federal agency and
the police officer says, you're arrested, you're
charged, it's not an illegal alien -- or it is an
illegal alien.
MR. CLEMENT: My supposition, Justice
Sotomayor, is that they would use that call to not bring
the prosecution, so the issue wouldn't even arise. But
I do want to be clear about --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. How
about -- what -- how about they get a response, yes,
it's an illegal alien?
MR. CLEMENT: And they bring a prosecution
under Section 3 and then --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how -- where do they
get the records that show that this person is an illegal
alien that's not authorized to be here?
MR. CLEMENT: I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Who do they get it from?
MR. CLEMENT: I think they would get it from
the Federal authorities. I think it would be admitted.
There might be a challenge in that case. I mean -- you
know, this is a facial challenge. I'm not going to try
to address that potential Sixth Amendment issue.
What I would like to say is two things.
One, if there is some sloppiness in the way the Federal
government keeps its records, so that there's lots of
people that really should be registered, but aren't, I
can't imagine that sloppiness has a preemptive effect.
The second thing I would say is that I do
think, in thinking about Section 3 in particular, the
analogy is not the fraud on the FDA claim in Buckman.
It's really the state tort law that says that it's a
violation of state tort law to not even seek the
approval that's needed under the FDA for a device.
Now, states impose tort law for people that
market a device without getting the necessary approval.
And nobody thinks that's preempted because it serves the
Federal interest. It doesn't have a deluge of
information. It forces people to get FDA approval.
And in the same way, this state law will
force people to register, which is what the Federal
government is supposed to want in the first place, so
there is no preemption there. There is no conflict.
As to the employment provision, I do think
it's important to recognize that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your
sentence.
MR. CLEMENT: -- before 1986, the -- the
government was not agnostic about unlawful employment by
aliens. The employees were already covered, and they
were subject to deportation. So the government said,
we're going to cover the employers for the first time.
I can't imagine why that would have preemptive effect.
Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Clement, General Verrilli. Well argued on both
sides. Thank you.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:27 a.m., the case in the
