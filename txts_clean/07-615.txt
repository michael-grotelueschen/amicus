CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

Support For the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of
Iran versus Elahi.
Mr. Bederman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BEDERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, good
morning and may it please the Court:
At the heart of this appeal is a matter of
statutory construction. Respondent received $2.3
million in public funds under the Victims Protection and
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. TRIA provides, and this
is at the blue brief, page 11a, that a party electing to
receive such funds must relinquish rights with respect
to enforcement against property that is at issue in
claims against the United States before an international
tribunal or that is the subject of awards by such
tribunal.
The property in question here is the Cubic
judgment. Respondent renounced rights to attach the
Cubic judgment because in case B/61 before the
Iran-United States Claims Tribunal at the Hague the
United States has demanded that any awards Iran receives
in its claim against the United States be set off by the
amount of the Cubic judgment. This can only occur if
the Cubic judgment is released from Respondent's lien
and is remitted to Iran's Ministry of Defense.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they could
have agreed that they have a bank account somewhere and
any amounts would be set off by that. That wouldn't
make that bank account at issue with respect to their
claim.
MR. BEDERMAN: No, in that scenario I agree
with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that that would not be
implicated, because I think the clear import of the
statutory language here that Congress is trying to
achieve is that being at issue -- as you'll notice, the
statutory provision in 201(c) is disjunctive. It refers
to claims against the United States -- at issue in
claims against the United States before an international
tribunal, or that is the subject of an award. So I
think the disjunctive character of the statute might
indicate that the at-issue prong includes a broader set
of property than would be indicated possibly by the
"subject of an award."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't matter
that Iran recognizes that this would be used to set off
a judgment it might obtain, because you just said, well
they could -- a bank account could be used to set it off
and that's not sufficient.
MR. BEDERMAN: Well, the mutual -- let me be
clear. The mutual position of Iran and the United
States before the Claims Tribunal is that the Cubic
judgment, because it's related to a claim within the
tribunal's jurisdiction -- and I think that's a key
limiting principle here. The United States would not be
entitled to set off amounts in bank accounts that are
attributable to other parties or other aspects that are
not implicated in claims or defenses before the
tribunal.
So clearly an examination of the tribunal's
jurisdiction and the relevant claims or defenses that
are before the tribunal is relevant here. Petitioner is
not espousing a position before this Court that any
inchoate property located anywhere in the world would be
blanketed with immunity under this provision. It's not
necessary to reach that conclusion in order to find for
Petitioner here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The United States at some
stage told the tribunal in The Hague that the Cubic
judgment -- and now I'm quoting -- "has nothing to do
with matters before the international tribunal."
"Nothing to do with."
MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, that is the language
used by the United States in a memorial before the
tribunal. The United States has also indicated, and
this is clear in the gray brief at pages 81 in note 32
and the gray brief at pages 83 to 85, and in the
lodgment, that if -- if Iran receives an award in case
B/61 it must be offset or set off, or "recouped" is
sometimes the language used in the correspondence
between the two governments before the tribunal, by the
amount of the Cubic judgment.
I won't speak for the United States position
before the tribunal. The United States is here to do
that, of course, Justice Ginsburg. But the only way I
can interpret that remark is to indicate that obviously
before the tribunal is the issue of the United States'
obligations to Iran under the Algiers Accords. The
Cubic judgment deals, of course, with the private
disposition of the contractual relationship between
Iran's Ministry of Defense and the Cubic military
contractor.
Now Respondents take the position that these
two make the matters unrelated. But if you review
carefully the tribunal's jurisdiction as encompassing
both claims and counterclaims, and according to the
Algiers Accords in the claims settlement declaration,
counterclaims include that which arises out of the same
contract, transaction or occurrence that constitutes the
subject matter of the claim.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no counterclaim
stated before the tribunal as of this moment.
MR. BEDERMAN: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the
first.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no counterclaim
in the case before the tribunal.
MR. BEDERMAN: That's right. The United
States did not file a formal counterclaim in case B/61,
but it has made a demand for a setoff. And within the
tribunal rules, a setoff can be the subject of notice
under Rule 19-3 or an amendment or certainly comes under
waiver of objection provision in Rule 30.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask that
question. In other words, there are cases or at least
it is contemplated that there will be cases under the
rules, where the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal does
determine that there should or should not be an offset.
MR. BEDERMAN: There -- there certainly have
been cases, if you are speaking of the tribunal's
earlier jurisprudence in terms of offsetting claims.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.
MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, there has certainly been
ample tribunal precedent which the United States has
relied upon in making this demand for a setoff.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But assuming -- assuming
the tribunal takes up some such issue as Justice Kennedy
has mentioned, it will start with the assumption that
the Cubic judgment is in fact a valid judgment. It will
not look behind the Cubic judgment as such, will it?
MR. BEDERMAN: Of course, the validity of
the Cubic judgment does remain on appeal when the Ninth
Circuit --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's an entirely
separate proceeding. Assuming the Cubic judgment has
not been reversed through the appellate process that it
is going through, then the tribunal will take the Cubic
judgment as it finds it.
MR. BEDERMAN: I would assume it would. And
I assume --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Doesn't it make it
pretty tough to say that the Cubic judgment is at issue?
MR. BEDERMAN: No, Justice Souter. If -- if
we understand Congress' -- I don't -- I think this
matter can be resolved by a straightforward textual
approach in looking at TRIA section 201(c). Evidently,
though, if we are looking at congressional intent here,
it is to protect the United States' litigation position
before the tribunal. To allow the attachment of the
Cubic judgment would simply be allowing Respondent to
remove a source of money that would be available --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, I think we
understand that. And -- and it's clear that the United
States, in effect, is taking the position that that's
all we need to bear in mind. But it suggests to me that
the drafting of the statute did not go as far as it
might have gone to protect the interests of the United
States.
MR. BEDERMAN: I won't speak, of course, for
the United States' position. The Petitioner's position
is that where property has been identified to the
tribunal as being related to a claim or defense within
its jurisdiction, and the availability of that property
affects the relief that can be granted by the tribunal,
it is at issue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain to me why it
would effect the relief? Because suppose Iran doesn't
get the proceeds of the Cubic judgment, but instead a
creditor of Iran, in this case Elahi, a creditor gets
it. It should still be -- you've paid the -- Iran's
bill. Iran owes money to X. Why shouldn't the United
States equally get the credit whether the Cubic judgment
in the end is pocketed by Iran or by Iran's creditor,
Elahi?
MR. BEDERMAN: Well, obviously we await the
tribunal's award in this respect. And I believe, based
on the tribunal's past precedents, the benefit in terms
of finding a breach of the Algiers Accords as it would
or it must in this case to find in favor of Iran, would
indicate that the benefits accruing for certain setoffs
must ultimately come back to Iran in order to be
credited in the way that you suggest.
I think it is an improper position to
suggest that if a creditor of Iran or Iran's Ministry of
Defense in this instance can claim or assert the lien so
that somehow it's credited to Iran's account, so to
speak, in calculating the setoff of the tribunal. That
has not been the tribunal's jurisprudence in terms of
examining the implications of a breach by the United
States under the Algiers Accords. And in a number of
cases --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you -- something
that I would just like clarification on. You mentioned
that the Cubic judgment is on appeal to the Ninth
Circuit. It has been on appeal since June of '98?
MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, ma'am.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there are cross
appeals. What are the positions taken about that
judgment by the respective sides, and why is it pending
for ten years?
MR. BEDERMAN: That has been a mystery to me
as well. In fact, there has been a resolution by Cubic
Defense Systems and Iran's Ministry of Defense and as
soon as the Court renders its judgment in this case,
that matter will finally move to disposition. It is a
bit odd that the underlying issue of Cubic's objections
to the district court's enforcement of the International
Chamber of Commerce or ICC arbitral award has pended for
so long. I would have thought, logically, it would have
made more sense to have disposed of those issues and
then allow the disposition of the liens to be resolved
by the Court.
Essentially, it is Cubic's appeal
challenging aspects of the district court's enforcement
under the New York convention of the ICC arbitral award.
I think to the extent that there is a counterclaim it's
simply that there were some bases for support of the
judgment which Iran's Ministry of Defense would have put
forward in addition to the district court. That's what
I understand in terms of the ruling of Judge Brewster
originally in the district court on this manner.
So, yes, it is unfortunate that the
underlying validity of the Cubic judgment still remains
open as a matter of appeal.
But again to return to your point,
Justice Ginsburg, in Cases 815 and 821 before the
tribunal this question of what would be the
implications, financial and otherwise, for the United
States being found by the tribunal to be in breach of
the Algiers Accords because of the failure of not
allowing the export of Iranian property or repatriation
of Iranian property to the United States has been
explicated. And, in fact, in already one instance the
tribunal has found the United States to be in breach of
Algiers Accords obligations.
So again, I can't speak for what a ruling in
the tribunal would be. All I can suggest is certainly
the Iranian position before the tribunal would be that
in the instance that if Mr. Elahi or any other lienor
were successful in attaching the Cubic judgment that in
such a situation it should not be credited as a setoff
under these circumstances.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could -- let's assume
that the -- that Iran is able to execute on the Cubic
judgment. Could it take the proceeds out of the United
States, given the 2007 blocking order?
MR. BEDERMAN: Well, I mean, the issue of
the secretary of state's October 2007 designation, which
I think is what you are referring to, is a late
development in this case. Of course, that occurred
three months after the Ninth Circuit's amended opinion.
My submission to this Court is that the
appropriate disposition, assuming the Court well takes
Petitioner's position that Respondent has actually
relinquished its claim under TRIA, is to remand back to
the district court, because then we would have two new
sets of lienors, Mr. Raffi and Mr. Rubin. It would be
before the district court that factual issues like
whether the designation of the "Ministry of Defense and
Armed Forces Logistics," which is what is actually named
in the blocking order, actually covers the Ministry of
Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic
Republic of Iran, who is your Petitioner today.
The issue of whether designations cover
particular entities or aliases of entities is an
intensity factual one; the D.C. Circuit in the National
Council of Resistance case, Chief Justice Roberts, an
opinion you are well aware of at the D.C. Circuit.
These are intensely factual inquiries about whether
aliases of particular organizations are covered by
designations.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned -- you
mentioned that there were other claimants or others --
others who would like to execute --
MR. BEDERMAN: Other lienors.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- other lienors -- other
attachments. And so, you said in the end -- well --
well, what would be the effect of those other liens?
MR. BEDERMAN: My understanding,
Justice Ginsburg, is in both the cases of Mr. Rubin and
Mr. Raffi, as far as I am aware, they have not made the
relinquishment election under TRIA as Dr. Elahi has done
here. And because they have not made the relinquishment
proviso, they would not be subject to the at-issue
question that is now before the Court.
Iran's Ministry of Defense has other
substantive defenses against their liens, which we
appropriately presented before the district court.
The only submission I am making to this
Court at this time is that it is not necessary for this
Court exercising plenary authority to decide whether
it's a blocked asset. That is appropriate for remand
because, notwithstanding the U.S. position, I think
there are questions of whether your Petitioner is a
covered entity under the -- under the designation, and
whether in fact it is the beneficial owner, whether
Iran's Air Force is the beneficial owner of this claim.
And there are other substantive defenses that claim
retroactivity, as well. So, again, I just don't think
it's appropriate --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But going back to the main
issue, the only reason that this is at issue before the
Iran tribunal is because it might be a setoff in the
event of judgment in favor of Iran?
MR. BEDERMAN: Yes. Whether it is available
for setoff. And again, I want to be clear that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the -- that's
the only basis for your argument? I thought it was a
broader suggestion that these are, to some extent,
substitute assets for the assets that are at issue?
MR. BEDERMAN: Well, I mean, that may be one
useful analytic in thinking about this. I was trying in
imagining the interest of the Court in understanding the
tribunal's jurisdiction under the Algiers Accords and
what the tribunal has already ruled, and that's why I
think respectful consideration might be appropriate
here, inasmuch as the tribunal, in interpreting its
jurisdiction under the Algiers Accords, which is
essentially its organic instrument, has made a
determination in Case B/66 that the substantive
contracts at issue here between Cubic and the Iranian
Air Force are at issue in case B/61.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you -- can you
articulate a general test in a sentence or two about how
you decide whether particular assets are at issue?
MR. BEDERMAN: Yes. I will repeat the one I
-- I rendered before because I think it is the most
useful analytic, and I -- I take no credit. This is
essentially Judge Fisher's analysis in the dissent
below. As he indicated, that -- that -- where property
has been identified to the Tribunal -- and certainly the
Cubic judgment and the proceedings that have occurred in
the Federal district court in -- in Southern California
and now the Ninth Circuit and now here have been
identified to the Tribunal in mutual representations and
undertakings by the parties. Where this property has
been identified to the Tribunal as being related to a
claim or defense within the Tribunal's jurisdiction --
and I think that is the key limiting principle here.
That's -- there is a criticism that an expansive reading
of TRIA's "At Issue" provision will allow Iran and the
United States, as unlikely as it sounds, to mutually
collude to cover various properties and assets around
the world, I think noting that the -- that the Cubic
judgment is within the Court's jurisdiction as
understood under the Algiers Accords Claims Settlement
Declaration, Article 2, paragraph 3.
And then the second prong is that the
availability of that property affects the relief that
can be granted by the Tribunal. And, again, we are not
hypothesizing here. The Tribunal has already indicated
in cases like Owens Corning, Futura Trading and Computer
Services, that when you have a situation avoiding a
double recovery, that a setoff derived from collateral
proceedings, even absent privity of contract with the
sovereign seeking adjustment and with respect to
different causes of action, a setoff is still
appropriate within the Tribunal.
So it's both an avoidance of a -- of a
double-recovery rule and also a notion that a -- a
certain offset is -- is related as within the -- the
jurisdiction of the tribunal as arising again from the
same contract transaction or occurrence.
JUSTICE SOUTER: "At Issue" means related to
-- "At Issue" means related to an issue in a separate
case.
MR. BEDERMAN: I mean --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's what it boils down
to, doesn't it?
MR. BEDERMAN: Petitioner is not taking the
same --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, doesn't it?
MR. BEDERMAN: No, Your Honor. I'm sorry.
The Petitioner's position is slightly more modulated
than the United States. The United States' position
here is all it has to be is relevant. I -- I will leave
it to the Court to -- to speak with the United States
about that in a moment.
I think a more nuanced understanding of the
Tribunal's jurisdiction is appropriate here. Is -- and
here there is no question, based on the materials that
you have not only in the joint appendix but also in the
lodgment, that the Cubic contracts have been identified
to the Tribunal. And now the Cubic judgment as an
offset has a setoff -- or "recoupment" is sometimes the
language used in the diplomatic exchanges and filings
before the Tribunal -- has now been identified to the
Tribunal.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is it the case that there
are two other individuals who have attached this
judgment?
MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, Justice Breyer. I think
I spoke about that a moment ago. That would be --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And is it the
case that Iran's position in respect to those
attachments is that those attachments, insofar as they
are valid and executed, require a setoff from whatever
we owe Iran or vice-versa?
MR. BEDERMAN: My understanding, if you are
speaking of me characterizing the United States'
position --
JUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm saying I take
it from something I have read in this that Iran believes
that if, in fact, it won a judgment and that judgment is
from someone like Cubic --
MR. BEDERMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- who they thought was
prevented from delivering planes because of the embargo
-- so it was relevant -- that that judgment, which they
get if they collect on it, should be deducted from other
money the United States owes them.
MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, and --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- unless instead of them
getting it, the attacher gets it.
MR. BEDERMAN: It's the --
JUSTICE BREYER: The attachee gets it.
MR. BEDERMAN: It's the "unless," I suppose,
that, of course, Iran objects to. It is that in order
for the setoff to be effective within the Tribunal's
jurisprudence and jurisdiction, Iran's Ministry of
Defense or -- or the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Has to get the money for
the attaching person. That's my point.
MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, sir.
JUSTICE BREYER: And so that is at issue
before the -- and -- and it is at issue in those cases.
If the person who attaches it gets the money rather than
Iran, Iran will say: We do not have to have a setoff.
MR. BEDERMAN: I agree. If it's at issue --
JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that right or --
MR. BEDERMAN: Correct. If it's at --
JUSTICE BREYER: And that is the same
question that you think would be presented through this
attachment, is that right?
MR. BEDERMAN: I thought that's what we were
speaking of: The status of the Cubic judgment and --
and Dr. Elahi's attachment of the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Dr. Elahi is one of several
persons, is that right?
MR. BEDERMAN: That is correct. There is a
queue of individuals who have lined up to -- to --
JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to get at
is Iran's position vis-a-vis the Elahi judgment is the
same as its position vis-a-vis the other two attachments
on the Elahi judgment.
MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, sir.
JUSTICE BREYER: That if Iran ends up with
the money, you can subtract it from other money the
United States owes them. But if the attaching people
end up with the money, you cannot.
MR. BEDERMAN: So it's "At Issue" -- I am --
I am sorry for having been so opague.  It is "At Issue"
in the sense of "joinder at issue," a legitimate
disagreement between the parties. And its also "At
Issue," I believe -- I think in the sense that Congress
intended by this provision of saying that the funds are
available for a tribunal ruling. And, therefore, to
allow an attachment under these circumstances would
frustrate the United States' litigation position. So
any way you parse what "At Issue" means --
JUSTICE BREYER: You would take the same
position if, in fact, this money which is owed to Iran
by -- by Cubic -- that is, Cubic, which then Iran got a
judgment on -- instead of a judgment in favor of Iran,
Cubic had written them a check, and they had taken the
check and bought a house in Manhattan, or they had put
it in an Iranian bank account, and either Mr. Elahi or
one of the other two people sought to attach the bank
account or the house or the grocery store, which they
might have also have used. Am I right --
MR. BEDERMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- or wrong?
MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, Justice Breyer, you are
correct. There is a concern, which is a very natural
concern, that the more attenuated you get, can you
attribute a particular property, whether it's a bank
account or a -- or a New York condo --
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see why either is
the slightest a bit more attenuated. In either case
they are owned by the Ministry of Defense of Iran.
MR. BEDERMAN: I would certainly concur;
and, if I may, I will reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Bederman.
Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The United States does not appear here today
in support of Iran, but, rather, in defense of critical
interests of the United States before the United States-
Iran Claims Tribunal. In particular, the holding of the
Court of Appeals that the United States never unblocked
Iranian military assets after the Algiers accords is
directly contrary to the position of the United States
before the Tribunal, and Iran immediately indicated that
it would use that holding against the United States and
in support of its multimillion-dollar --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not saying
that. Isn't that -- that issue is moot?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor,
there is now a new and independent reason why the asset
is blocked. And, in fact, Respondent no longer defends
the holding of the court of appeals on that basis.
It is, we wish to emphasize, essential that
this Court vacate that holding and indicate that it is
no longer legally valid so that it is not -- that
erroneous holding is not used against us in support of
Iran's two-million-dollar claim.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we -- if we took
the position that you are expressing about what is at
issue, we would never reach the second question.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, we -- we
think that the Court would not. It would vacate the
decision of the Court of Appeals. It would be helpful
certainly to the United States if the Court emphasized
the natural fact that that would mean that the court of
appeals' erroneous holding was not any longer legally --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not our job
to help you -- it's not our job to help you in other
tribunals. If a -- if a judgment is moot, it's moot.
We are not going to go back and tell the Ninth Circuit
to revise its opinion just because that's helpful to
you.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. The -- the
Court would vacate the decision, certainly.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is it your
position that that -- that is moot?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It is our position
that the -- because Respondent has relinquished his
right to attach these assets, the decision of the court
of appeals should be vacated. And that would have the
affect of rendering inoperative that erroneous -- the
other erroneous holding of the court of appeals with
respect to blocked assets.
It is the position of the United States --
and we agree with Respondent on this point -- that as of
now, because of the October, 2007, designation, the
property of Petitioner is blocked and subject to
attachment under TRIA. And I don't believe there is any
need for further proceedings on that.
The Secretary of State designated the
Ministry of Defense of Iran, and the position of
Petitioner in the court of appeals on remand from this
Court was that it is the Ministry of Defense of Iran, a
central core constituent part of the Iranian state, that
is the entity that was designated.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I understand correctly
that that means that because it's a blocked asset, then
Dr. Elahi can get it, but Iran itself couldn't get it?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Elahi, Respondent
Elahi, could get it if he had not relinquished his
rights to attach --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- assets at issue
before the tribunal. As of right now, the asset is
blocked and Iran could not repatriate it, as of right
now. Of course, blocking orders can be amended, but as
of right now it is frozen and Petitioner cannot
repatriate it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why isn't the
consequence that you are so worried about under the
Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act that
this is going to hurt your position by the tribunal, the
same consequence that is going to come from the fact
that these assets are blocked?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor,
again, the blocking order is the present status of the
assets. It doesn't mean that they could not later be
repatriated to Petitioner; whereas, execution by
Respondent against the assets would mean that they would
be forever denied to Petitioner.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So why wouldn't the
United States get credit for that, too, on the theory
that I suggested before?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, you are
right, Your Honor, that is the position of the United
States. And earlier Your Honor quoted language from the
oral argument of the United States that the -- or maybe
it was one of our briefs -- that the Cubic judgment
is -- that the tribunal doesn't have to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has nothing to do with
matters before the --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That is in the
context of our saying that, whether or not -- in the
view of the United States, whether or not Petitioner
ever collects that money, the United States is entitled
to an offset, and in fact, we believe it's a complete
defense to Iran's claim.
Of course, Petitioner's argument -- or
Iran's argument before the tribunal is that it is --
that the United States is entitled to a reduction of
liability only if Iran actual receives the assets. And
that's why the language of the statute is written more
broadly when the litigation before the tribunal is
ongoing. At that point any property that is at issue
before the tribunal is not subject to attachment by one
who has relinquished, and that's because this Court nor
any other lower court in the United States is supposed
to pre-judge the merits of those respective positions.
Iran's position -- and it's on page 85a of the United
States' appendix -- is that the awarded amount, unless
received by Iran, cannot be offset against any relief
which the United States may be found to owe Iran.
So that is Iran's position. That is at
issue before the tribunal.
The Respondent would have the Court believe
that the proceedings in the tribunal are in the nature
of an in rem proceeding, that it's a property dispute.
They use that term repeatedly in the brief, "a property
dispute." But that is not the nature of the proceedings
in the tribunal. Iran has asserted a claim that the
United States violated its obligations under the Algiers
Accords. The remedy it seeks is , and I quote -- this
is from -- excuse me -- from the -- let's see -- the
remedy they seek -- they seek is the value of the Cubic
sale to Canada. They have said that in the state -- in
Iran's reply in statement -- claim 16 that Respondent
relies upon, they say that the remedy they seek is not
the asset itself.
Of course, the asset had been dissipated
before Iran ever filed a statement of claim against the
United States. The remedy is the proceeds of that sale
to Canada. The proceeds of the sale to Canada, which
are the subject of Iran's claim against the United
States in the tribunal, have been reduced to judgment in
the Cubic judgment. That --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess this may be
the same question Justice Breyer asked. I mean, where
do you cut this off? You've got the proceeds from the
sale to Canada that presumably go to Cubic, and then
Cubic, you know, builds a new facility somewhere with
those proceeds and then sells it to somebody else. I
mean, are those still assets at issue in the claims
before the tribunal?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I believe
that in fact the language of the statute makes it -- the
assertions of the parties before the tribunal that
define the property that is at issue before the
tribunal. That, again, is so that the courts are not
put in a position of adjudicating, prejudging, the
merits of the parties' arguments before the tribunal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's kind of
a -- that's a broad assertion. In other words, so long
--
as you and Iran get together and say this asset is at
issue in a situation where whether it's at issue or not
saves you money and gives money to Iran, that seems to
be a very self-serving legal test.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I
don't believe that this Court needs to consider what the
outer reaches are. In this case, this is -- Iran
characterizes it, and this is at page, again, at page 85
of the U.S. appendix, that the Cubic judgment, quote
"constitutes an integral part of the remedy sought in
case B/61."
This isn't an offset or a counterclaim.
Justice Ginsburg, you previously alluded to the fact the
United States did not file a counterclaim. And that's
because this is not some unrelated counterclaim the
United States has against Iran. This is a critical part
of Iran's claim against the United States. It defeats,
in the view of the United States, Iran's claim entirely.
At the very least, it reduces the amount of Iran's claim
against the United States.
This isn't somehow unrelated; we're
asserting, well, we can use this as an offset because
you also owe us money from something else. This is in
Iran's own statement, and this is the statement that you
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But how is that affected
-- how is that affected depending on whether or not the
judgment is executed or not. Would the Iran tribunal
have the authority to order Cubic not to satisfy the
judgment, but to just hold the funds?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I -- I don't know.
Cubic is not before the tribunal. But what we can ask
is, can we conceive of -- and I think it's relatively
easy to conceive of -- an award of the tribunal that
says, the United States owes Iran $2.8 million; if the
Cubic judgment is received by Iran, the United States
owes Iran nothing. And clearly, in that circumstance,
the Cubic judgment is the subject of the award of the
tribunal.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know that it's the
subject of the award. And it's really not at issue;
it's just recognizing that there has been some prior
transaction.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I guess, Your
Honor, you have to think what does it mean for any
property -- property to be at issue before the tribunal
or the subject of the award?
JUSTICE SOUTER: It means that at the end of
the proceeding one side or the other gets the property.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And that is not going to be
the -- what one side or the other gets in this
proceeding is going to be a new judgment. And that new
judgment may or may not be satisfied by dealing with the
prior judgment. But that doesn't mean that the prior
judgment is at issue; it simply means that the prior
judgment may be used to discharge in an appropriate case
an obligation which is determined in the later
proceeding.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: If I may respond.
Your Honor, on that view, even the ACMR is not at issue
before the tribunal, because the tribunal cannot order
the United States to hand over the ACMR to Iran. In the
A/15 judgment to which Petitioner's counsel alluded
earlier, the tribunal recognized that it is not a
violation of the United States' obligations under the
Algiers Accords not to issue an export license.
Therefore, Iran --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So Iran --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- is not entitled
to the ACMR. It's entitled to its loss, and its loss
has been reduced to judgment in the Cubic judgment.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Thank you, Your
Honor.
Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
I think the previous 25 or so minutes has
demonstrated one sort of overarching fact, which is that
there is an enormous risk, if this Court decides to
interpret the language of this statute broadly, that it
will easily sweep beyond any kind of arrangements
between Iran and the United States in ways that
fundamentally, obviously, disadvantage the very people
that Congress clearly intended to benefit by this entire
statutory scheme.
This is a scheme that was designed to
provide remedies, recoveries, to the victims of
terrorism. And somehow in the scheme of everything that
was discussed in the first 25 or so minutes of this
argument, the victims of terrorism are completely
shunted aside on basic -- on the basis of very technical
ways of reading it.
But if we go back to the language of the
statute, which is in the Petitioner's brief at 11a, it
talks about "enforcement against property that is at
issue in claims against the United States." So the
notion that we would focus on the word "property," as it
relates to the tribunal and that the tribunal has in
front of it, is a natural consequence of the language of
that provision. And to me, at least, the best way to
look at the logic is to review how often the United
States has described and Iran has described what was the
property at issue before the claims tribunal and the
B/61 proceeding? And this is at 65a of the joint -- of
the government's brief: "The property at issue consists
of one air combat maneuvering range system and all
necessary subparts." There is no dispute that the
property was within the jurisdiction of the United
States. Now --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you had
these military assets, which are clearly the assets that
are at issue in Iran's claim --
MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Cubic is worried
about what to do with it and so they sell them to the
Canadians but they keep the proceeds in escrow, under
the theory that look we may end up owing this to the
Iranians under the tribunal. Under the setoff, this may
not be our assets, which -- I mean the Iranians have a
claim to these. Would those -- would those escrow funds
be assets at issue?
MR. PHILLIPS: I think they would be because
of the way the Iranians actually pled this. They said
give us either back -- give us either the military
equipment that we bought, or give us the economic value
of that. But that's -- and that's why --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why is that
very different from this situation, where you have an
arbitration award saying that you, Cubic, owe the
equivalent of what you should have -- what you would
have provided to Iran, if there hadn't been the
revolution?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two answers
to that. The first one is remember precisely what the
arbitration award is. The arbitration award is not the
value of the asset. That was asked for; that was
rejected by the arbitrator. The arbitration award is
for the value of a separate contract between Cubic and
the Canadian government. You will recall in the award,
specifically the arbitrator said with respect to the
underlying ACMR contract with Iran, that was mutually
walked away from by both parties, and then there was a
separate agreement that was entered into between the
parties, and that was the basis for the arbitration
award saying the value of breach of that secondary
agreement is the part that serves as the arbitral award.
That it seems to me ought to be regarded at a minimum as
one step too far removed, because that's not the
property that is at issue before the claims tribunal in
any way that the parties are disputing about it. They
accept that number. And then --
JUSTICE BREYER: Right. So what is the --
it seems at the moment, frankly you could read it either
way. Let's imagine that -- that Cubic sold some jets
that we blocked and they get some money, and they did it
under their contract, and they got 2 million dollars.
And suppose they said, we owe Iran this money, and they
pay Iran the money, and Iran puts it in a bank account
or buys the grocery store. All right?
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now suppose that happened.
It makes it simpler. And then what happens is three
people, including Mr. Elahi and two others who don't
accept money, the other two, attach it, on the ground
Iran owes us this money.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: We want the grocery store.
And suppose, further, Iran then says, if they get their
money, you cannot subtract it, United States, from what
you owe us. But if we get the money, then you can
subtract it. That's their view.
The United States' view is different. Who
will resolve that question? The tribunal. So they say,
what is at issue is not who owns the grocery store; what
is at issue is the question of whether we get the money
or you get the money. What money? The money that is
the value of the grocery store, or the bank account, in
which case it's identical.
Now I think in that situation it's easy for
me to say that money, the grocery store, or the bank
account, of course is at issue before the tribunal. For
the question is, does Iran get it or does the United
States get it, in the situation where the two other
people -- leaving Elahi out of it -- can attach it. I
can easily read it that way. I can also read it the way
you want.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right? So now, which
do I do?
(Laughter.)
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you clearly -- and I
agree with you; there is no question you can read this
statute either way.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I'll then add
that the strongest argument against you, it seems to me,
is the whole point of this was not simply to compensate
victims of terrorism. That's a worthy goal, and that's
one of the points. But it was to compensate them
consistent with the proper running, in the interests of
the United States, of the Iranian-American Claims
Tribunal.
And so this is just the kind of issue we
don't want to simply take away and let the victim have,
because there is a strong risk the tribunal will rule
against us, and we will have to pay it twice. Okay.
That's the argument against you.
Now, what's the argument for you?
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. First of all --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. PHILLIPS: A significant purpose of this
entire exercise obviously is to provide redress to the
victims of terrorism.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's one, but --
MR. PHILLIPS: 201(d) is a specific
statutory construction provision which seems to suggest
that Congress says that if there are doubts about how to
apply this particular provision, you ought to put the
thumb on the scale in favor of the victim. So you do --
you will give meaning to section 201(c)(4) of the TRIA
if you adopt a position consistent with our position.
The reality is that given that there are two
more lienholders in line, none of this has anything to
do with Iran and with the way the tribunal is going to
proceed, because even if you were to say that Dr. Elahi
is not entitled to this, there is no relinquishment
claim with respect to the others, so this money is never
going back to Iran, under any set of circumstances.
JUSTICE BREYER: That creates the issue,
because the question is whether money that never goes
back to Iran, but rather goes to an attaching person, is
money that is or money that is not subtracted from the
amount that the United States owes Iran.
MR. PHILLIPS: But -- but --
JUSTICE BREYER: And that question is the
question --
MR. PHILLIPS: But Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- is the question that is
before the commission.
MR. PHILLIPS: But the problem with this,
Justice Breyer, is that this is a relinquishment
provision. It -- it is saying to us in return for these
limited resources, 20 percent of the judgment -- and
that is only 20 percent of the compensatory judgment and
completely lose the punitive judgment -- in return for
that you have to relinquish certain rights; and it seems
to me that Congress would not have adopted the a
provision that said and the rights you relinquish are
essentially unknowable under any circumstances and
extend to the ends of the earth. What I --
JUSTICE BREYER: They are totally knowable.
They are totally knowable. In order to decide what they
are all you have to do is to look at the issues before
the commission and decide whether those issues concern
specific, concrete property; that is, the property that
you have an interest in.
With my grocery store, with my bank account,
and with this claim, it is absolutely specific, and Iran
has put before the commission the question of whether if
you pay the money to an attaching person, we don't get
it, or we do get it.
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I gather. Now
you can tell me I'm wrong on that if you want.
MR. PHILLIPS: The parties have been very
specific about it, and we cited in a series of
quotations about what is the property at issue here; and
the property at issue, Justice Breyer is the ACMR system
or the economic value of the ACMR system. What is not
at issue in this case is the value of the Cubic
judgment. First of all, there was an effort to bring
the Cubic judgment specifically before the tribunal, and
it was rejected as having no jurisdiction, certainly no
jurisdiction over Cubic and then no jurisdiction over
the United States' part of the Cubic judgment because
that was not a contract between --
JUSTICE BREYER: They are trying to attach
the ACMR system.
MR. PHILLIPS: They did --
JUSTICE BREYER: They are trying to attach
the Cubic judgment. The ACMR judgment is in Canada.
MR. PHILLIPS: But that's the whole point of
this. The property at issue before the tribunal is the
ACMR system, and indeed in 1981 when this was originally
brought what Iran wanted was the ACMR system.
JUSTICE BREYER: And that's one piece of
property. The other piece of property that is at issue
is the judgment, and the way it's at issue is I take it
that two other people are saying, we attach it; Iran
says because they attach it, you don't subtract it from
the ACMR judgment; and we are saying, even though they
attach it, you subtract it, and therefore it's before
the tribunal as well.
That's my understanding at the moment, and
I'm asking you to explain why that's wrong.
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, there is no
question that the fact that there are subsequent
lienholders in line affects the possibility, but I would
have thought it would only affect it in a way that is
positive for me. Because Iran is saying, look, this
doesn't have any relevance to the -- to the Iran
tribunal if we don't ever get the money; and the reality
is whether Dr. Elahi gets the money or the other
lienholders get the money, Iran is never going to get
the money, which says to me it's not at issue under any
theory of the case in front of the U.S.-Iranian claims
tribunal.
And so that would be my quickest answer to
that; to the extent that you have other lienholders, it
simply means that there really is nothing at issue
there. But it still seems to me that the better way --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? I mean, the
question I raised before, why wouldn't the United States
be urging that it gets credit, whether Iran gets the
money or whether the people who are creditors of Iran
get the money. In either case, the United States should
be able to have --
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, the United States
would still have that -- would still have that argument,
but it's not a claim against the United States, which is
what's required under the statute that we are dealing
with here when it's viewed that way.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Iran might say in the
tribunal, in responding to the setoff argument, this
claim that we brought against you, the United States,
implicates a breach of obligations that you have that
are un -- somewhat unrelated to what was at issue in
the -- in the -- in the Cubic judgment. And then the
United States would say, no, that's not true. So they
would have to examine the Cubic judgment. So that means
it's at issue before the court.
MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think there is
anybody whose going to -- well, maybe there is some
sense in which examining the Cubic judgment, but I don't
think the tribunal has remotely been asked to or will
under any circumstances be asked to review the Cubic
judgment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: There might be in the
setoff proceedings. There might -- there might be an
argument that there are two obligations, and there is a
setoff or that there is a setoff.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, I think there
is no question these are for two different obligations.
And I think that's why candidly the Court ought to
decide that this is not property at issue here, because
it is so clearly unrelated to the weapons system itself
or to any monetization of the weapons system. Remember
--
the Cubic judgment comes from an arbitral award that
doesn't have anything to do with that arms sale. It has
to do with a completely separate contractual undertaking
between the Cubic and the Canadian government --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think we might get
MR. PHILLIPS: -- and Iran.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- substantial -- a
substantial degree of argument on that point.
MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know how there could
be an argument on that point, Justice Kennedy. If you
read the opinion of the arbitrator, it is absolutely
clear that the -- that the underlying agreement between
Iran and Cubic with respect to the arms sale was
mutually terminated by the parties, and a new agreement
entered into in order to resell those properties to
Canada. The opinion is crystalline in that regard.
And it was on the basis of the violation of
that separate agreement that the -- that Cubic was then
held to be liable to Iran for the $2.8 million.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The agreement
between who -- between who --
MR. PHILLIPS: Between Iran and Cubic.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So Iran, I assume,
would say, look, we entered into this agreement to take
the place of what was at dispute. Which is what they
owed us because they didn't ship us the arms that we
paid for. I don't see that that adds anything to your
argument.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it just says that you
move even further down the road from what are the
properties that are, in fact, at issue before the
tribunal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, so Iran says,
look, you are not going to ship us the planes, whatever
it is, you are not --
MR. PHILLIPS: Although they wanted that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You were not going
to give us the money, right?
MR. PHILLIPS: And they still want that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And we still have a
dispute. So, I tell you what, you are going to sell
this stuff to Canada, you are going to get some money
from them, and we have got an agreement that that money
is ours.
MR. PHILLIPS: Mr. Chief Justice, that --
that -- they may have been able to make that argument.
That is not an argument they have made. The argument
they made, which represents the property at issue in the
claims, is first, give us back the arms; and then two,
give us the value of those arms, not as they have been
reformulated in a completely separate contract, give us
the value of those arms. It seems to me the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why would
Cubic enter into a contract with Iran to give them money
if it wasn't taking the place of the money they owed
them in the original agreement?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the question was, they
were going to try to go forward in these arrangements.
And it was a, you know, complicated problem because you
couldn't tell whether or not you would ever be able to
send things back to Iran, et cetera. And so, they were
perfectly happy to enter into an agreement where they
would say, look, we will just do the best we can and see
how it turns out.
I mean, in reality, the litigation in front
of the Ninth Circuit, obviously, on the Cubic judgment,
Cubic is screaming loud and clear that they don't think
they owe a nickel as a consequence of this arrangement
that there had been no breach of anything under any
circumstances, and that there is not a penny that's to
be owed. And as counsel said earlier, it's in some ways
unfortunate that this has moved in this sequence. So,
we don't really have --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why it
was pending for ten years?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it was stayed as a
consequence of this other litigation -- as a consequence
of these proceedings in order to allow, I think in
general the Iran claims tribunal to -- to sort out, at
least, some portion of these issues. It would obvious
be -- I mean, we have moved -- I mean, we are not a
party.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the stayed
because it was at issue before the Iranian claims
tribunal?
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I mean, the truth is
just as the issue was a more important issue for the
United States prior to the new blocking order, you know,
the questions that could potentially have arisen were
potentially more important to the claims tribunal at the
outset. As the litigation has played out, it turns out
that there's no relationship between the two.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the -- the other
thing -- and I think this counts against you, but maybe
you have an answer to it, that there could be a lot of
property that was directly at issue in '79 or '80 that
Iran didn't get. And because they didn't get it, all
kinds of things happened with property, and you get more
of it or you get less of it. And during the interim
years all kinds of things happened.
And it could be that those transformations
at different times are directly before the tribunal,
irrespective to how much damages you are going to get,
and how much -- we can easily think of cases if we have
three or four hours. But you see where I am going?
MR. PHILLIPS: Sure.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I can understand
Congress in passing this statute having one of two
possible things: One is say we are just going to cut an
arbitrary line here because it's a compromise, and what
we will do is, you can go ahead, victim, and seize
anything you want, as long as it doesn't narrowly fit
within this. That's a somewhat arbitrary line but a
compromise.
MR. PHILLIPS: But it also provides
protection for victims, right, and those are the people
who are the most --
JUSTICE BREYER: The other way to look at it
is to say, well, what we that had in mind here is we
will pay these victims something; you know, they are
going to get something right from Congress right now,
because they are hurt. But in return from that, we
don't want you taking action that will really affect our
liability to Iran. And if it's the second, then we
needed broader definition; if it's the first, we don't.
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, I think the
Hague cases are the place to look in terms of trying to
understand this, because what it's what -- Hague, that
line of cases all involve efforts to seize consular
properties of Iran and all arose prior to the Accords,
and every one of those courts of appeals has concluded
that each of those properties is beyond the ability of
the courts to attach all of those properties.
And -- and it seems to me that what Congress
was concerned about was having inconsistent claims
potentially arise in both the district -- in federal
court in the United States and in front of the claims
tribunal.
So where you have a situation where the
claims tribunal says, look, that's a consular property
that belongs to the Iranian government, you should
return it, and have the United States have to show up in
front of that tribunal and say, oh, excuse me, but
unfortunately, we have been forced to sell that property
under a federal court order and the embarrassment that
arises from that. That seems to me so clearly what
Congress had in mind, or at least is clearly covered by
this and the case law or all the case law up to this
point that has dealt with it has consistently ruled in
favor of the United States and Iran in that context.
But there is no reason to go beyond that context in
order to deprive the clear victims of terrorism of a
meaningful remedy.
And I think, Justice Breyer, just to be
clear about this, we got money back, to be sure. A
substantial portion of the money we got back came from
the values of the properties that the United States
seized from Iran that they've used, they have leased out
embassies and stuff like that. And that is not property
that comes out of the United States' fist.
So it's not reasonable to assume, as the
government does, that simply because these moneys were
paid out, that there is some huge relinquishment that is
required there. It seems to me that it makes much more
sense for this Court to narrowly construe this.
I guess the last thing I would say in that
regard is, that insofar as we can tell, this case will
affect one party -- actually, I guess the other two
lienholders behind us. But realistically, there are no
cases in the pipeline. There is no other litigation
that is on going out there. This is a singular -- I
mean, it's kind of unusual for this Court, but this is
the only case that we can figure that this applies to.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the point
is, depending on how it comes out, once you give a
argument to the Iranians that they can raise with the
claims tribunal that will affect far more than your one
single case. We -- the argument would be the United
States is not living up to the obligations it undertook
in the Algiers Accords.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And,
Mr. Chief Justice, that -- I understand why the
government filed in support of Certiorari at the earlier
stages of this proceeding. But after the intervening
blocking order that takes the -- I mean, that issue is
off the table.
We are no longer defending the Ninth
Circuit's view that the United States breached the
original Algiers Accords in the context of this case.
Nothing in the blocking order that is in place now and
would prevent Iran from getting this remotely violates
the Algiers Accords. And as far as I know, no one is
making that argument at this stage. So all you have is
a relatively clean -- issues. Does the blocking order
apply here in stopping the payment of these funds to
Iran? There the answer seems to me unquestionably yes.
And then the second question is, do we adopt
a rule to the detriment to a single terrorist victim in
a way that deprives him of an opportunity to get back
fair redress in the absence of some clear indication
from Congress that it intended that result where it
would affect no one else and where Congress has said
specifically in a rule of construction, put your thumb
on the scale in favor of the victim of terrorism?
That's what we are asking the Court to do in this case.
It provides no problems to the United States in its
claims tribunal litigation. It's only an issue of
money.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What provision --
can you cite me the provision where the Congress said
put your thumb on the scale?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. It's 201(d)(4), the
Petitioner's brief at 11a.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 11a. And how does
that -- the title of the section says statutory
construction. I just don't see what follows as
statutory construction.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what you have
to do is give the language some credit. And our way --
what we think Congress intended there was to say, tip
the scale in favor of the victims of terrorism, which is
the underlying purpose of the statute.
I will confess, the language is not nearly
as clear as I would like it to be, but I will also
recognize that the -- the Government of Iran's position
renders that language as total dead letter --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't see any --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- alternative it seems to me
you ought to give it -- again, give the tie to the
victims under this --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't see any
problem with Congress telling us how to conduct
statutory construction?
MR. PHILLIPS: No, I think Congress does --
is entitled to suggest, if it's -- if you have ambiguity
in our language, which way to come out as a matter of
policy. No, I don't think that's -- no, I don't think
that's dictating -- that's certainly not dictating a
result in this particular case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, one piece
of -- I don't -- you have agreed that the United States
could recoup from Iran the amount paid to the victims,
including Dariush Elahi, including the 2.3 million. How
would the United States go about recouping from Iran the
money it has paid to the victims of Iran's terrorism?
MR. PHILLIPS: You mean in the situations
where the United States has subrogate -- right to
subrogation?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. How would that
work? How would -- how would the United States --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think it would almost
certainly work as a matter of diplomacy and not as a
matter of adjudicated resolution. I think what they
will say is, these are rights, these are amounts of
money that we have had to pay. And if we are ever to
normalize relations with the Government of Iran, we are
going to expect the Government of Iran to recognize
those payments and to make some kind of retribution to
the United States under those circumstances.
And again, all it does is it shifts the
burden of these injuries from the victims, who are in
the least best position to deal with them, and put them
in the United States, which is in a position of at least
some hope of being able to resolve them diplomatically
in a way that the United States can, in fact, be
recompensed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said this is a one of
a kind case. Are there no other victims who have
successfully sued Iran?
MR. PHILLIPS: There are, but the problem is
you have to back into the situation of property that is
at issue in the claims tribunal. The claims tribunal
was created in '81. It's not a lot of that property
around. We're talking 25 years later. So, they have
pretty much played out their course.
There were the Hague noted cases, and the
Elahi case. The others are going to be resolved without
regard to these provisions. And so, the reality is what
the Court says today will affect my client, but as far
as I can tell no one else. And certainly, the only
interest the United States has at this stage in this
litigation is its own financial interest. And it would
seem to me, that's not a basis on which to interpret the
statute.
If there are no further questions, I urge
the Court to affirm.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Phillips.
Mr. Bederman, you have two minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. DAVID J. BEDERMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BEDERMAN: If I can make just a few
points. In response to Respondent counsel's assertion
that in the International Chamber of Commerce arbitral
award there's been so form of novation here, which makes
the connection between the ACMR and the Cubic judgment
somehow attenuated. I think that's -- by the
tribunal's -- the panel's discussion, this is at the
joint appendix at page 47.
The panel makes very clear that under the
sales contract credit has to be given to Iran for its
advance payment. Here you have a breakout of the
salvage value of the ACMR. All that the panel was
indicating was that Iran was not entitled to specific
performance here, to make that ruling is not a finding
of a novation in the sense which would respond to
counsel using that phrase. So, I don't see the
attenuation here.
Speaking to the assertion that, again, the
enormous risk presented by this case of the broad
construction of the congressional intent, I think if you
look carefully at the language at the blue brief at 11a
of the statutory construction provision -- that was part
of the colloquy between the Chief Justice and
Respondent's counsel. And if you read this, it
completely reserves, if not begs the question of whether
the Cubic judgment is, quote, an asset otherwise
available under the section for attachment.
So, I think it completely doesn't answer,
one way or the other -- a finger on the scale, as
Respondent's counsel has evocably said, or some form of
command by Congress to this Court. It simply reserves
that question for the Court's analysis.
In response to Justice Ginsburg's last
question to Respondent's counsel, the one thing I would
point out to you again, is another clue in the statute.
If we look at the Victims Protection Act, which was the
predecessor statute here, section 2002(c), what Congress
wanted to protect is the right of the United States to,
quote, pursue these subrogated rights as claims or
offsets of the United States in appropriate ways.
So, again, Congress has contemplated the
notion that there will be a process of setoffs either
before the Iran U.S. claims tribunal or in some other
context, which I'm not sure I can imagine beyond what
response counsel has said. So, to suggest that the
broad remedial thrust of TRIA, which Petitioner is not
denying -- it's not our place to deny that -- is
nonetheless tempered by these carefully crafted
provisions in the statute.
We would support, obviously, reversal of the
lower court's opinion.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
