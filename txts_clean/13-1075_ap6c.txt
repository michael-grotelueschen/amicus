States v. June.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH PRELOGAR
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. PRELOGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
There is good reason to believe that
Congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to
apply to the FTCA time bar, and I'd like to begin by
focusing on a few of the issues that arose last hour
that are particularly important to understanding
Congress's intent.
To start with the questions, Justice Scalia
and Justice Kagan, that you were asking at the end about
the nature of our rule and what separates this statute
from other statutes.  I want to be very clear:  We're
not urging a categorical rule about all pre-Irwin
statutes.  Here, we have statute-specific evidence about
the FTCA that makes clear that Congress did not want
this particular enactment to be subject to equitable
tolling.
And that's most clear, of course, from the
plain text and those 12 words, "Every claim against the
United States cognizable shall be forever barred
unless," that was lifted, Justice Scalia, as you said
verbatim from the Tucker Act context where it had been
repeatedly interpreted as a jurisdictional limit not
subject to tolling.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't doubt that
if -- if those words appeared in a statute that Congress
passed tomorrow, we would not interpret them as a
jurisdictional bar, would we?
MS. PRELOGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think it
would depend on whether there was an indication that
Congress was intending to incorporate those words from
the Tucker Act context.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought at least if a
statute passed tomorrow, we have the clear statement
rule that we have said -- we have told Congress if you
don't want to have any tolling, if you want this to be
jurisdictional, absolutely rigid, you say so, and of
course, Congress, it's your call.  But we're not going
to interpret a statute that doesn't make that clear
statement as jurisdiction.
MS. PRELOGAR:  But this Court has also
emphasized, Justice Ginsburg, that there are no magic
words that are required in this context.  And I think
Bowles v. Russell makes that particularly clear.  There,
those words, "shall" and "notice of appeal," were
interpreted to have jurisdictional import.  And so to
here in this context --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because this Court had
before -- had before said that provision about how much
time you have to appeal, that that was jurisdictional.
And I thought the Court's position was we decided it
once, and we're going to stick with it.  But if we
haven't decided it, then we look at it.  We look for a
clear statement.
MS. PRELOGAR:  It was not only Section 2107
in -- in that context, but also predecessor provisions
and other similar statutory requirements.  And that's
what the Court said in Henderson, when a long line of
this Court's decisions interpreting similar requirements
have said that those requirements are jurisdictional,
then we'll presume that Congress intended the same
meaning.  Here, we have the identical language that had
that jurisdictional label attached to it.  And that's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't -- I don't quite
get the identical language because "shall be barred," I
mean, that's common to a lot of statute of limitations.
You're not suggesting that this would be different if it
just said "shall be barred" rather than "forever
barred," are you?
MS. PRELOGAR:  No.  We're saying that when
Congress lifted and incorporated word for word the
then-prevailing Tucker Act time bar, it clearly was
signaling an intent to incorporate the judicial
interpretations of that Tucker Act time bar.
And -- and, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I think
this is an important point about those early Tucker Act
cases.  Those were not drive-by jurisdictional rulings.
Those were carefully considered decisions that attached
jurisdictional consequences to the -- the Tucker Act
time bar and said that it couldn't be waived.  It wasn't
subject to equitable tolling.
So this wasn't a -- an argument that was
made in passing or something that the Court didn't
carefully consider.  Rather, the Court made a -- a
decision in those cases that that language had
jurisdictional import.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. -- Ms. Prelogar, I'm
wondering what you think about Mr. Schnapper's analogy
to the private right of action cases, because it seems
to me very similar is that we're dealing in an area here
in which Congress doesn't generally say what it wants
with respect to some kind of procedural rule, maybe
because Congress doesn't usually think about it.
And we have one set of interpretative rules
to deal with that situation, and then those
interpretative rules basically switch off and we get the
opposite set of interpretative rules.  And the way it's
worked in the private right of action cases, we don't
look back and say, well, gosh, you were enacting this
statute in the world of Cort v. Ash, and you used
language that was identical to language that the Court
assumed gave rise to a private right of action there,
and so you get a private right of action, too.
We've not said that.  We've said, you know,
now we're in a different world and we're going to
require more of you than what the old -- than the old
language that gave rise to a private right of action
under Cort.  Why is this any different?
MS. PRELOGAR:  Justice Kagan, this Court has
said in the implied private right of action context that
you have to look at the contemporary legal context.
That was the Cannon case that we cite in our opening
brief and our reply brief.  And this Court, in Alexander
v. Sandoval, made clear that -- that those holdings
hinged on the fact that Congress had acquiesced in the
decision that had prevailed at the governing time.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Were -- were those --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Didn't our cases --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- were those two cases
pre- or -- that you just cited pre- or post-Irwin?
MS. PRELOGAR:  Well, I was talking about the
private right of action cases, Justice Kennedy.
So with respect to statutes that -- that
predate Irwin, if you actually look at how Irwin has
fared and what the Irwin scorecard is, more often than
not, this Court has held that there isn't equitable
tolling in suits against the government.  The Court's
considered that in five cases, and in four of them,
Brockamp, Beggerly, John R. Sand & Gravel, and Auburn
Regional Medical Center, it's held that the presumption,
if it applies, is rebutted.  So I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Didn't -- didn't the
private right of action cases suggest rather strongly
that Cort v. Ash was wrong?  That the prior notion that
when Congress says nothing about it, there is an implied
cause of action was wrong?
MS. PRELOGAR:  That's true, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And have we -- have we said
that prior notions of what Congress meant in the past
about jurisdiction were wrong at the time?
MS. PRELOGAR:  No, not at all.  And I think
that is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So I don't think the two
are parallel at all.
MS. PRELOGAR:  And it's an important point
here that there's no question that when Congress was
enacting the FTCA in 1946 and at all relevant times
thereafter, when it was making changes to this time bar,
it -- it did view that as a jurisdictional limit, and
the Court has never questioned that -- that historical --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was -- that was the
way everything was -- involving the government and
sovereign immunity was all, quote, "jurisdictional."
And then we said -- and if -- if Congress
made a statute, we said, well, we call that
jurisdictional.  Congress never called it
jurisdictional.
Then we took a fresh look at this, and we
said that's -- that's an exorbitant use of the word
"jurisdiction."  Sure, you can have a -- you can have a
statute that has a very tight time line; that doesn't
mean it's jurisdictional.
MS. PRELOGAR:  Justice Ginsburg, let me
respond to that by -- by taking a moment to emphasize
the history of the FTCA, because I think it's perfectly
clear that Congress at every turn, at every relevant
historical juncture, signaled its approval of the view
that this time bar was jurisdictional and could not be
tolled.
Congress has made significant changes to the
time bar four times:  In 1946, 1949, 1966 and 1988.  And
at each of those times, Congress's words and actions
were either inconsistent with or unnecessary in light of
an equitable tolling doctrine.
I could just tick through them.  In 1946,
Congress enacted the FTCA time bar and expressly
declined to include a tolling provision, even though it
had considered earlier bills that did include that kind
of tolling provision, which, as this Court has said, it
was a deliberate choice, rather than an inadvertent
omission.
In 1949 Congress was aware that there had
been individual cases of hardship and debated in one of
the hearings whether to create a reasonable cause
exception.  Instead of doing so, Congress decided to
extend the deadline from 1 year to 2, which would have
been unnecessary if equitable tolling could take care of
the hardship.
1966 is particularly important because at
that point there were 2 decades of experience with the
FTCA and every lower court to consider the issue had
held that it was jurisdictional and not subject to
tolling.  Congress was aware of those decisions because
repeatedly litigants came to it during that time period
and requested relief in the form of a private bill.  And
there, Justice Ginsburg, Congress did use that magic
word "jurisdictional."  Congress repeatedly  granted
relief through private laws that conferred jurisdiction
on district courts notwithstanding the time bar in
Section 2401(b).
Finally, in the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it was responding
to our cases that use "jurisdiction."
MS. PRELOGAR:  And acquiescing in those
cases, I would argue, when Congress then, in 1966,
reenacted the time bar without making any material
change.  Congress was aware that this is how courts were
interpreting the -- interpreting the time bar, and this
Court itself had just recently announced in Soriano that
the Tucker Act time bar and that language was
jurisdictional, not subject to tolling, and -- and Congress
acted in reliance on those decisions when it reenacted
the bar in '66.
Finally, in 1988, this was when Congress
enacted the Westfall Act.  At that point in time there
was a particular situation of hardship that had arisen
when a claimant had sued a Federal employee and then the
United States was substituted as a defendant after the
time had run to present a claim to the administrative
agency.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Prelogar, I do think
that the -- the other side's account, at Mr. Schnapper's
account of the Westfall Act, the one that Congress was
intending to benefit was not the plaintiff, not the
injured plaintiff.  It was the Federal employee, because
until Westfall v. Erwin, the Federal employee was off
the hook.  He wasn't -- so then when this Court, said,
Federal employee, you are going to be stuck, then
Congress passed a relief measure for the Federal
employee, not -- not the plaintiff.
MS. PRELOGAR:  It's absolutely the case,
Justice Ginsburg, that that was the overall purpose of
the Westfall Act.  But Congress included
Section 2679(d)(5), which was the provision that gave
the claimant extra time to present a claim, 60 extra
days, if the claimant was out of luck because the time
of the statute had run by the time the United States was
substituted as a defendant.  And that exception that
Congress introduced in 1988 would have been entirely
unnecessary if Congress thought that courts could take
care of this on a case-by-case basis through equitable
tolling.
So I think that the historical story here is
consistent and it's clear.  At every turn --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You are equating
reasonable cause or -- or something comparable with
equitable tolling.  Equitable tolling, as Justice
Ginsburg pointed out earlier, is much harder to get.
MS. PRELOGAR:  That's absolutely true,
Justice Sotomayor, that it might be hard to get it in an
individual case.  But -- but I think that it's clear,
and this again comes from the Tucker Act line of cases,
that Congress did view this as a -- a strict limit on
the waiver of sovereign immunity, and that Congress had
a right to suggest that it didn't even want to extend
that waiver one bit more.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I ask a question?
You've both been arguing this as if your situations are
identical.  But do you disagree with the Respondent here
who says that -- who characterizes the administrative
claim process under the FTCA as claimant friendly?
MS. PRELOGAR:  Certainly that process is
claimant friendly, but when the Court has emphasized
that concern in other cases, and I'm thinking here of
Bowen and Henderson, the Court was looking specifically
at the time bar and whether it was claimant friendly.
In Bowen, the time bar itself had a
provision that allowed the secretary to extend out the
limit for appealing a Social Security benefits denial,
and the secretary had interpreted that to encompass
principles of equity and fairness.
In Henderson, when the Court emphasized the
claimant-friendly nature of the procedural posture of
that case, the Court emphasized that there was no time
limit at all for a veteran to present his claim.
So in those cases it was the time bar that
was claimant friendly.  And here we don't have that at
all.  We have a strict, absolute limit that has no -- no
space within the text to permit any -- any notions of
claimant friendliness.  So I think that is a relevant
distinction between those cases where it has made a
difference and where it has not.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Prelogar, I asked
Mr. Martinez a question before and, to tell you the
truth, I've just forgotten his answer to it, so I'm
going to ask you.  How about 2401(a)?
MS. PRELOGAR:  The government's position is
that 2401(a) is jurisdictional, but I want to say at the
outset that each statute has to be interpreted on its
own terms --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why is 2401(a)
jurisdictional if every statute has to be -- you know,
Mr. Martinez said it's those exact 12 words, and 2401(a)
doesn't have those exact 12 words.
MS. PRELOGAR:  2401(a) originated in the
Tucker Act itself in 1887 and, based on that Tucker Act
historical pedigree, we think that the same
interpretation of it that was longstanding would --
would govern here in this context.  So that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is there -- is there any
statute of limitations that applies against the Federal
government that you don't think is jurisdictional?
MS. PRELOGAR:  Other than the ones that this
Court has -- has already ruled upon, I can't think of
any off the top of my head.  But I have to confess that
I haven't done an extensive statute-specific analysis
with respect to all of them.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if that -- if that's
all --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Have you stopped beating
your husband, right?
JUSTICE BREYER:  If, in fact -- you've heard
this already, but I'd like your specific answer to it.
In Irwin, Chief Justice Rehnquist says, we -- a
waiver of -- they are holding a new rule.  He says that.
He says that we now -- a waiver of sovereign immunity
cannot be implied, but must be express.  Once Congress
has made such a waiver, all right, we think that making
the rule of equitable tolling applicable to suits
against the government in the same way that it is
applicable to private suits amounts to little
broadening.  Such a principle -- da, da, da -- and
that's what we hold.
Now, has not the Court, I'm not sure,
applied Irwin to statutes that were enacted before
Irwin?
MS. PRELOGAR:  It has, Justice --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, if, in fact, we were
to hold with you in this, how would we justify that?  I
mean, this is a statute that -- that, as much as any, is
trying to equate -- waives sovereign immunity, trying to
equate private suits against private people with suits
against the government.  So if some times Irwin applies
to a pre-Irwin statute, when no one in Congress thought
that they would be doing that, why isn't this case in
that?
MS. PRELOGAR:  Well, let me be --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I know you've given many,
many answers, but the answers that I hear are all
answers that Congress at the time probably thought that
equitable tolling wouldn't apply.  I agree.  That is
probably what they thought, if they thought about it.
But the same is probably true of dozens of statutes that
were passed pre-Irwin.
So what's the distinction?  Because
Rehnquist says we now are laying down -- we think this
case affords us an opportunity to adopt a more general
rule.  He thinks he is applying a new rule.  And -- and
that's applying to prior statutes.  So why not this one
if it's any?
MS. PRELOGAR:  Irwin adopted that rule
because it judged it to be a realistic assessment of
legislative intent.  But Irwin made clear that it's a
rebuttable presumption.  As this Court said in John R.
Sand & Gravel, it's not conclusive, and it can be
over --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I agree with you that Irwin
does say it is likely to be a realistic assessment of
legislative intent.  That is one reason given among
others.  If I don't agree with you, that that was meant
to be absolute rather than simply a factor in the mind
run of cases, suppose I don't accept your argument
there, then I would have to apply it to this statute;
right.
MS. PRELOGAR:  And we agree that the
presumption applies at the outset.  At the threshold the
government has the burden --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I know, and what you're
saying is that there are certain things that rebut it.
But all those things, it seems to me, come down to
saying, as I just said, that Congress, at the time,
thought there wouldn't be equitable tolling.  And that's
why I asked this question.  That would seem to me to be
true of many statutes, if not all of them, passed before
Irwin, and yet we have applied Irwin backwards.
MS. PRELOGAR:  It may well be, Justice
Breyer, that it's easier for the government to rebut the
presumption with respect to pre-Irwin statutes because,
of course, under Irwin this Court does have to consider
what the prevailing and contemporary legal context was
at the time the statute was enacted.  Holland makes that
clear where it suggests that the presumption has greater
force as applied to statutes enacted after Irwin.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But every statute that it
applied to in Irwin was enacted, how many years, 18
years before Irwin.
MS. PRELOGAR:  In 1972.  That's correct,
Justice Ginsburg.  Of course, there is a relevant change
in the law that happened in that time period.  In 1967
-- this is, of course, after the FTCA had been reenacted
-- this Court decided Honda v. Clark.  That was the
first decision holding that there could be equitable
tolling in a suit against the government.  And so, by
the time Congress enacted Title VII in 1970-- in 1972, it was
legislating against a backdrop where there wasn't a
uniform line of precedence from this Court saying that
every statute waiving sovereign immunity was -- was necessarily
subject to tolling.
I think the important point here -- and this
comes from Honda v. Clark as well -- is an observation
about – about the mode of statutory interpretation that we're
urging.  In Honda v. Clark the reason the Court reached
that conclusion that there could be equitable tolling
notwithstanding the sovereign immunity considerations,
is because the statute in that case, the Trading with
the Enemy Act, had been expressly patterned after the
Federal Bankruptcy Act.  And this Court said that lower
courts had interpreted the Bankruptcy Act to permit
equitable tolling.  And so, the Court said that the
Trading with the Enemy Act should be interpreted the
same way.
That's precisely the argument we're making
here.  It's an argument about how Congress would have
understood these words when it took them directly from
the Tucker Act context and imported them into the FTCA.
I would like to make a brief observation
about respondent's primary effort to distinguish the
Tucker Act cases.  And -- and this is the distinction that
respondent draws between the court of claims and
district courts.
Respondent says that those tribunals
exercise fundamentally different powers when it comes to
equitable tolling.  But that would radically alter how
this Court has long understood the court of claims'
powers.  As we explained in our reply brief, all of
respondent's cases deal with the issue of equitable
remedies.  Whether the court of claims can issue an
injunction.  No, it can't, but that's also true of
district courts applying FTCA claims.  There the
district court is only considering a claim for money
damages.
And the important point is this Court has
never distinguished between the powers of the court of
claims and powers of district courts with respect to
equitable doctrines, equitable recoupment, equitable
reformation of a contract, the equitable doctrines of
latches and estoppel.  Down the line, the Court has
indicated that the court of claims has those powers
equally with district courts.
So there is simply no tenable basis to say
that that tribunal-focused analysis creates a difference
between the presumptions that should apply with respect
to equitable tolling.  It also doesn't do anything to
explain this Court's Tucker Act cases.  If, in fact,
respondent were right and this was a function of the
tribunal, then what this Court could have said in those
cases is, here is a statute administered by the court of
claims; thus, there's no equatable tolling.
But, of course, that's not what this Court
did in Kendall, Finn, Soriano, John R. Sand & Gravel,
the entire line of cases.  Instead, those cases turned
on the text of the time bar and the fact that this was a
waiver of sovereign immunity and that Congress intended
that waiver to be interpreted narrowly.
And -- and, Justice Breyer, to your point about how
equitable tolling rarely applies -- Justice Ginsburg, I
think you mentioned this as well -- I do think it's
important to look at this historical context and what
this meant for Congress in 1946.  And by today's light
it's not a particularly big deal to sue the United
States in its own name for money damages, but when
Congress enacted the statute in 1946 it was an
incredibly big deal.  And, in fact, it took Congress two
decades of debating this bill to even grow comfortable
with the idea and to get everyone on board with waiving
the sovereign immunity of the United States for tort
actions.
The Federal government was out ahead of the
states in this.  The house report that accompanies the
1946 legislation notes only four states that had waived
their sovereign immunity for tort claims.  By 1969, it
was only 17 states that had fully waived their sovereign
immunity, only four of which, by the way, permitted any
form of tolling.
So I think it's pretty clear that when you
look at the statute and you look at what Congress
intended in 1946, those were the factors that motivated
it, this was a strict condition on the waiver of
sovereign immunity and Congress intended it to be
interpreted narrowly.
If there are no further questions I would
like to reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Rosenkranz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
All of the arguments that you heard in Wong
apply with equal force to our case; that is, Mr.
Schnapper’s  arguments.  But they apply with extra force
with respect to the administrative presentment
requirement.  And the inclusion now of an administrative
presentment requirement actually sheds some light on
what Congress must have meant with respect to the filing
provisions.  So there are additional reasons with
respect to administrative presentment, and a lot of the
arguments that the government has been making,
particularly in the first argument in Wong, simply don't
apply to 1966 or to administrative presentment.
So Ms. Prelogar says 1966 was important.  It
was important.  As of 1966, this scheme looked like a
completely different scheme from the scheme that
Congress passed in 1946.  The Tucker Act, the suit
filing deadline runs from accrual.  There's no
presentment requirement.  The statute of limitations for
filing a lawsuit is six years from accrual.  There are
statutory disability provisions.  FTCA, the suit-filing
deadline now runs from an agency action, from the final
determination.  Presentment is required.  The statute of
limitations for filing the lawsuit is now six months
from the agency action and there are no listed
exceptions.
Now, the context is fundamentally different
than for the presentment provision and now for the
entire FTCA statute of limitations, but let me just talk
first about presentment.  So the central -- first of
all, the central focus of presentment is informality, is
flexibility.  You fill out a one-and-a-half page form.
You literally handwrite into little boxes.  It takes 30
minutes to fill out.  If you send it to the wrong
agency, no big deal.  The Department of Justice sends it
on to the right agency.  And the administrative process
that is triggered by that filing is not what anyone
would view as an adjudication.  The statute says it's
about settlement, it's about negotiations.  To Justice
Breyer's point, you're usually unrepresented by counsel.
And the notion -- and DOJ says specifically in its
regulations that what is supposed to happen are,
"Informal discussions, negotiations and settlement
rather than any formal or structured process."
The notion of applying a rigid, indeed
jurisdictional rule to that very informal process, flies
in the face of the whole informality that Congress set
up for the suit-initiating process.
Secondly --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And without need to say,
there were no prior cases talking about whether this was
equitable tolling under the Tucker Act because there was
no such thing.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That is exactly right.
The -- the presentment requirements all came into play
in the '60s.  They were never applied to the Tucker Act.
This was part of a spate of new law so the backdrop law
against which this is being interpreted, all we have
now, not when Congress passed it, but all we have now is
Zipes.
Now, all of the -- all of the criteria that
I was ticking off as to what the statute of limitations
looked like, it looks like Title VII.  In Zipes this
Court tells us -- that is the statute of limitations in
Title VII -- in Zipes this Court tells us that the
presentment requirement is not subject to equitable
tolling.  So that's the second point --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Rosenkranz, so I
understand you, are you arguing that tolling applies to
the presentment provision even though it doesn't apply
to other provisions?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it possible for us to
hold that?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That is not what I'm
arguing, Your Honor.  What I'm arguing is tolling has
always applied, certainly, to this statute, certainly
under Irwin for reasons that I will explain in a little
bit.
But when Congress reenacts this in 1966, it
makes abundantly clear that that conclusion is correct.
Because now we've got this presentment requirement,
which I think refreshes congressional intent with
respect to what it was thinking on jurisdiction.
But -- but I will circle back to this in a
moment as I said, but I agree with everything Mr.
Schnapper said.  In 1946 it was also not jurisdictional
for the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what you mean
by "refreshes congressional intent."  We have a fairly
rigid doctrine that repeals by implication are not
favored.  And are you saying that intent was "refreshed"
so that even if Congress originally thought this was
jurisdictional in the narrow sense, it now no longer is
because of the adoption of the presentment provision?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I am not, Justice Scalia.
Let me just be clear.  Our position is from 1946 on, it
has always been subject to equitable tolling, it has
never been jurisdictional.  But to the extent that
anyone doubts that -- because as Justice Alito points
out, Congress wasn't thinking about any of this, so all
we are talking about is a battle of presumptions.  We
have two clear statement rules.
And I grant you, Justice Scalia that there's
also another clear statement rule with respect -- or
another presumption, that is, with respect to choosing
language from another source, which I will also get to
in a moment, but let me just, if I may, finish on
presentment.
The third point I was going to make is that
as originally drafted, this presentment requirement was
never a requirement.  It was in the original FTCA.  It
was permissive.  So with respect to repeals by
implication, what happens next is Congress makes it a
requirement.  And the presumption then, or the
Government's position then, as I understand it, is, when
Congress turned it in -- turned it from permissive to a
requirement, Congress also made that requirement both
jurisdictional and impervious to the age-old doctrine of
equitable tolling.
Next point, this Court has never ever found
that an administrative presentment provision is
jurisdictional or overcomes the presumption in favor of
equitable tolling.  And that really is a version of the
point that Justice Sotomayor was making.
Fourth, it is at least relevant that the
statute here runs from accrual and not from some hard
and fast point.  And the -- the Government is making
this argument that our fraudulent concealment point is
really an accrual point.  Well, if it is, then that
means that the same conversations one would have about
fraudulent concealment one would have about accrual
anyway.
So I -- I kept promising that I was going to
go back to the baseline points, and the baseline
points --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rosenkranz, in that
regard, would you clarify what is the Government's --
what is your position in response to the Government's
rather strong answer to your suggestion that equity was
foreign to the claims court?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, yes, Your Honor.
First, let me begin by saying that our basic position is
that -- that the presumption exists that Irwin was a sea
change in the law, that Irwin changes things as to every
other statute moving forward.  But we've also ticked off
a series of differences between the Federal Tort Claims
Act and the Tucker Act, and this difference in forum was
one of them.
So from the start, and I mean 1863, the --
the claims court was just a very different body from a
district court.  Congress viewed it really as an arm of
Congress at first and then it got adjudicatory powers,
but it didn't have, in 1863 when Congress passed the
statute and in the 1870s, '80s and into the early 20th
Century when this Court was interpreting the statute,
the court of claims just simply did not have equitable
powers.  This Court said it in Bowen.  "The claims court
does not have the general equitable powers of a district
court."
Now, the Government cites several cases --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you contradict the
Government on that point.  I'm sure the Government said
just the opposite.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  The Government did say just
the opposite and the Government cites several cases.
Now, it is telling --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It didn't say the
opposite.  It said the claims court didn't have the
authority to give equitable remedies.  It didn't have
the authority to enjoin.  But from the beginning it had
equitable doctrine as part of its --
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Agreed, Your Honor.  The
Government has taken the opposite position from what I'm
saying with respect to whether the court of claims from
the start had broad equitable powers putting aside
injunctions.
And my point is, the first case that the
Government cites is 50 years after the court of claims
was created.  By that point, the jurisdictional train
had left the station.  Kendall had been decided, Finn
had been decided.  It was already set in stone that this
was a court whose -- for whom the statute of limitations
was jurisdictional.
Now, the cases the Government sites, its
best case is Bowles v. United States, that's already
1935, I mean, that's many, many years later.  And not a
single one of those cases, including Bowles, ever
creates a case-by-case equitable sort of claimant by
claimant analysis of the sort that equitable
tolling involves.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you say they are
later cases but they didn't say the law has changed from
what it used to be; did they?  Didn't they purport to
say that the court of claims had always had that power?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, they didn't purport
to say it but they did say the court of claims currently
has that power, and I grant you that I'm -- that that
may sound like splitting hairs, but we're trying to --
we're trying to get behind what this Court was doing
back in the 1870s and 1880s.  And I'll just emphasize,
several of the cases that the Government cites, are
cases in which what the court of claims does looks like
the result is equitable, but what this Court held was
that equity had nothing to do with why this Court
approved what the court of claims did.  But rather, this
Court was saying the powers that the court of claims was
exercising were actually in the statute.
So Milligan is a particularly striking
example.  This Court said that the court of claims
action with which the Government chalks up to equity,
actually quote, "Seems to us to fall within these words" --
that is, the words of the Tucker Act -- quote "in their
obvious and literal sense."
But I don't want to dwell too much on the
difference between the forums because --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if I could
just pause there, I mean, obviously I'll go back and
reread Bowles.  But in Bowles they said the money should
be returned because it offended principles of natural
justice and equity.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It doesn't sound
like something in the statute.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and
what was going on in Bowles was also not
claimant-by-claimant decisions, it was sort of a broad
class of claimants.  And I agree with you.  That is the
one -- that is the closest case to what the Government's
position is.
But those other cases are, to the extent
that the court of claims is exercising what looks like
equity, it's always in favor of the Government.  Which
is consistent with the manner in which the court of
claims was born.  It was intended to be a parsimonious
doler out of government funds.
So I want to turn, though, for a moment to
the proposition that this is just a wholesale
withdrawal -- excuse me, a wholesale adoption of the
Federal Tort Claims Act plunked into a -- excuse me, a
wholesale adoption of the Tucker Act plunked into a new
framework, a -- a new statute.  It is not.  Certainly
not in 1966 for the reasons that I've described, but
also not in 1946.
First, I've already mentioned this forum
distinction.  Secondly, there are -- there is a
distinction and Congress understood there to be a
distinction between torts and contract claims -- on the
one hand, and contract or takings claims on the other
hand.  Contract claims and takings claims, even
contracts, Federal contracts, are governed by Federal
law.
Torts -- this -- the Congress made the
decision that tort claims are going to be governed by
State law and it adopted statutes of limitations that
mimicked State law statutes of limitations.  That
one-year statute of limitations was an effort to try to
mimic what States were doing.  And it changed to two
years, Congress said, because it wanted to mimic what
States were doing a little bit later.
And it's important to understand that the --
the State tort laws were always subject to equitable
tolling.  The differences between a two-year statute of
limitations and a six-year statute of limitations is --
is very considerable, especially when one brings to mind
the sorts of considerations that Justice Breyer
mentioned, that tort claimants are often -- are often
unrepresented.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rosenkranz, may I
interrupt you because I thought I heard Ms. Prelogar say
that at the time that the FTCA was adopted, there were
only four States that applied tolling.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I -- I don't -- I don't
believe that is true.  Equitable tolling has been a rule
that courts -- that courts have applied since the 1800s
to all manner of -- of claims.  Torts were no exception.
And one of the reasons that States had such short
statutes of limitations was precisely because equitable
tolling provided a relief --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  She's -- I'm not
talking about their equitable tolling in tort cases.
She's saying in waivers of sovereign immunity, tort
claims against States, which is slightly different.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Oh, yes.  Yes, yes.  So --
so let me just rephrase what I understand the government
to be arguing.
Those weren't equitable tolling provisions
in statutes, as I understand the point the government is
making, those are exceptions to statutes of limitations.
They're rigid.  They look like the Tucker Act
exceptions, but they're not case by case.  They are --
if you're overseas, as Mr. Schnapper said earlier --
actually, it doesn't matter whether you're monitoring
the docket and you can fully preserve your -- your
claims, it's just sort of a flat-out bar.  And those are
the ones that -- that I believe the government is
speaking about.
Those are statutory.  And as Mr. Schnapper
pointed out, statutory exclusions from the statutes of
limitations have always coexisted with equitable
exclusions.  And I also --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think, like
Mr. Schnapper, that your way of looking at this would
call into question McNeil v. U.S.?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor.  And I
don't think it calls into question McNeil v. U.S. at
all.  So -- and there are two pieces to the answer.  The
first piece is, let's assume that McNeil was a
jurisdictional ruling, which means that in order to
present your -- in order to file your lawsuit, you have
to present your claim first to the agency.
Well, in order to file a lawsuit, in real --
outside of this context, you also have to file a
complaint.  The filing of a complaint is jurisdictional,
but that doesn't mean that the time limit for filing it
is jurisdictional.  So too here, if indeed the filing of
an administrative form -- you know, this administrative
presentment is jurisdictional, that doesn't mean that
the -- that the time limit for filing it is also
jurisdictional.
But I said there were two halves.  The
second half is I agree with Mr. Schnapper, this Court
came to a conclusion in McNeil.  The conclusion is you
can't have your lawsuit without exhausting
administrative remedies.  That was not stated as a
jurisdictional ruling.  It was -- it -- it is analyzed
much more like an exhaustion ruling, to my mind, which
doesn't necessarily mean jurisdictional.
So I was beginning to tick off some of the
differences between the Federal Tort Claims Act and the
Tucker Act, and I was talking about the differences in
statutes of limitations, the differences in the nature
of the forums, the differences in the nature of the law,
and I want to come back to that last one.
The FTCA treats the government like a
private individual.  It says it three times in the
statute and it treats the government, to the Chief
Justice's question, as a private individual with respect
to liability.  So it's not with respect to all
procedures that might come up, but it says with respect
to liability.  Well, statutes of limitations dictate
liability and the procedures attached to the statutes --
excuse me, the time limits attached to the statutes of
limitations also affect liability.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have -- I have a
question.  Why is it important to tie this presumption
of jurisdiction or not to the 1946 Act?  I mean, why
don't you just say that whatever presumptions existed of
borrowing from the Tucker Act obviously changed in 1966.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They changed the
language, they changed the process.  I mean, do we need
to go back?  Why -- why not just say, whatever the
presumptions were with respect to the jurisdictional
nature in the Tucker Act in 1946, or even thereafter,
got completely thrown out the window in 1966?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That -- that was indeed,
Justice Sotomayor, my opening point.  And I've been
making this argument --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But then you said I
agree with Mr. Schnapper that since 1946 --
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So -- so I was making the
argument to those like Justice Scalia, who reject our
refreshment theory --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- and -- and say, well,
what about 1946?  And even in 1946, that if you apply
the Irwin presumption, which this Court said in Irwin it
would, you get the same result.  And that's -- that's
the fundamental point on the precedence that I want to
make sure to emphasize.
Our argument is not that this is a living
statute that blows in the wind with congressional
intent.  Our argument is that Irwin made it clear that
there is a sea change, that Soriano and all the cases
dating back on the Tucker Act adopted a vision of what
Congress must have intended that Irwin says is wrong.
That is not what Congress intends just because it waives
sovereign immunity.  And so --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I don't think
it can be regarded as such a sea change because the
basic principle is you're looking to legislative intent.
And he said, the -- the late Chief, that the realistic
assessment of legislative intent is likely to be found
based on the presumption.  Of course, you know, subject
to rebuttal.
So that doesn't seem to me to be -- the
whole point is we think this is how best define
legislative intent, and that I thought has always been
the rule.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, that's always been
the rule, Your Honor, in the private context and the
government is now being put in the private context, but
that was not always the rule with respect to the
government and certainly not consistently because we
have Soriano.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But, I mean, that
was not a legislative intent.  The view was not that we
think the presumption of legislative intent is -- is no
equitable tolling.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Oh, Your Honor, I -- I beg
to differ.  As I read Kendall and Finn, they didn't --
this Court did not use phrases like "presumption."  But
what this Court did was to say Congress didn't say
anything about this, but it was legislating against a
backdrop of waiving sovereign immunity, and when
Congress waives sovereign immunity, we have to read
statutes in a particular way; we're going to read them
very strictly.
Irwin says, no, that's not how we're going
to read statutes, that the better way to read statutes
is to assume the opposite, that Congress did not intend
statutes of limitations to be jurisdictional.  And
sure -- and by the way, John R. Sands says, and I quote,
"It was" -- and I quote -- "a turn in the course of the
law," which now, quote, "places great weight upon the
equitable importance of treating the government like
other litigants and less weight on the special
governmental interest in protecting public funds."
Words that this Court, perhaps by accident, but -- but
almost took directly out of the Federal Tort Claims Act,
treating the government like it treats other parties.
So -- so Justice Scalia makes a powerful --
powerful point about a countervailing presumption.  But
it is not -- by which I mean it is another presumption,
but it is a -- it is an argument  that doesn't play out
plainly in this context.  And the reason is, as was
covered in quite a bit of detail earlier this morning,
the notion of -- of fixating on the words "forever
barred" or the eight or 12 words around it to the
exclusion of the rest of the statute is just wrong.
The -- there was no magic to the words
"forever barred," not in 1863, not in 1946.  If you do a
Westlaw search of forever barred, you will find scores
of garden-variety statutes of limitations that are
structured exactly this way and that use the exact same
words.  And that's the point Justice Kagan was pointing
out, Professor Sick's -- Sisk's brief at page 20 gives
all sorts of examples.  Mr. Schnapper gave others.  The
Fair Labor Standards Act is one.  The -- the statutes or
statute that this Court was interpreting in both Klehr
and Rotella is another.
And then layer on top of that the fact that
the Federal -- that the Tucker Act no longer even has
"forever barred" in the language, and still this Court
says it bears the same meaning.  And it points out in --
in John R. Sand's that the change in language did not
make a fundamental difference.
And as I was saying -- oh, let me just make
one more point on this.
In 1877, this Court, in a case called
Sanger, which was also cited in Professor Sisk's brief,
says that that very language, forever barred, is, quote,
“an ordinary statute of limitations.”
So let me just pause and see if the Court
has other questions that it wants to draw me to.
So if there are no further questions, we
respectfully request that the Court affirm the court of
appeals.  Thank you, Your Honors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Prelogar, you have eight minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH PRELOGAR
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. PRELOGAR:  If I could just make three
points.  First, with respect to the administrative
presentment requirement in particular, I want to be very
clear on this.  From the beginning, from 1946 forward,
there was an optional administrative presentment
procedure, and this appears in our brief at page 9a.
This is the original text of the FTCA time bar, and it
uses the very same operative language with respect to
that administrative presentment option:  Every claim
against the United States cognizable shall be forever
barred unless.  So this is a procedure that has been in
the FTCA from the very beginning.
In 1966, what Congress did is make that
administrative presentment requirement mandatory.  But
when it did so, it did so against the backdrop of every
lower court to consider the issue, holding that this
language was jurisdictional, not subject to tolling.  It
did so against the backdrop of Congress repeatedly, in
the private bills, making clear that this was
jurisdictional language and that it had to confer
jurisdiction on district courts when plaintiffs were
trying to proceed outside the time limits.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you saying that the
administrative process was jurisdictional?  I mean --
MS. PRELOGAR:  Well, the administrative
presentment requirement itself, of course, this Court
had held -- which it has held was jurisdictional in the
McNeil case.  I'm not aware of -- of lower courts in
that time limit --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did we use the language,
"jurisdictional"?
MS. PRELOGAR:  You affirmed for lack of
jurisdiction, and I think that McNeil language does show
that it's an absolute or strict deadline.  There is no
room to any exception to it.  Every lower court has
understood McNeil to be jurisdictional, and Congress, in
1988, when it enacted the Westfall Act specifically said
in -- in the House report that the administrative
exhaustion requirement was jurisdictional, which is why
it created that -- that narrow exception to permit an
extra 60 days.  So I think it is clearly settled that
the exhaustion requirement at this point is
jurisdictional.
But the point that I was trying to make
about the 1966 reenactment is there, against that
consistent backdrop about what this language means, the
language that Congress had used, Congress, to set forth
a presentment requirement, used the same language once
again and -- and, therefore, intended it to have the
same meaning.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Mr. Rosenkranz
tells us that that language is pretty typical for your
ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of limitations.  It
sounds pretty daunting, you know, forever barred, but
apparently that's the normal language that's used.
MS. PRELOGAR:  And it's absolutely the case,
Mr. Chief Justice, that it is not "forever barred"
itself that necessarily has magic import here.  It's the
Tucker Act analogy, the fact that Congress got this
language from the Tucker Act, and that in that context,
which was a parallel context, it had interpreted to be
jurisdictional which makes the difference here.  Every
statute will have to be evaluated in light of not just
the text but its context and history.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Are exactly the problem
because the -- really the better language in Irwin is,
again, the Chief Justice, "A continuing effort on our
part to decide each case on an ad hoc basis as we appear
to have done in the past would have the disadvantage of
continued unpredictability without the corresponding
advantage of greater fidelity to the intent of Congress.
We think that this" rule affords us -- "this case
affords us an opportunity to adopt a more general rule,
to govern the applicability of equitable tolling in
suits against the government."
Yet everything I've heard, not everything,
but many of the things I've heard say that this statute
is special because if we go into the history of it, if
we decide what the various other rules are that might
infer intents where they say nothing, if we look over
the -- if we do this, if we do that, we will discover
that here, unlike many other statutes that use the words
"forever barred," here Congress really intended it.
Now, how do we reconcile that view with the
two sentences I just read?
MS. PRELOGAR:  Well, Justice Breyer, I think
that it would be very easy if the Irwin presumption were
just conclusive, but it's not.  The Court adopted that
presumption as a way to implement congressional intent,
and the Court made clear that it's rebuttable, which
means that the government is -- if the government can
come forward with statute-specific evidence that it is
rebutted, the Court needs to honor congressional intent
in an individual case.  So the Irwin presumption can't
excuse the normal statutory interpretation process,
looking at the text, context, and history.
A brief point on the court of claims issue.
If I understand Respondent, he would distinguish our
cases by saying that they were all rendered after this
Court's Tucker Act line of cases in 1906 and 1935.
Notably, that's before Congress enacted the FTCA.  And
it shows that Congress, when it was enacting that
language, had no reason to think that there was some
tribunal-based difference between the court of claims
and the district court such that the language would be
interpreted in fundamentally different ways based only
on the tribunal.
A final point I -- I would like to make,
drawing back, to just focus on what I understand to be
the basic divide between the parties in this case.
Respondents in both cases seek primarily to rely on a
general presumption, the Irwin presumption, which wasn't
announced with this particular statute in mind.
The government has come forward with an
overwhelming amount of statute-specific evidence related
to the text, the context, the history of this statute,
and that statute-specific evidence has to control.  The
Irwin presumption is rebutted.
If there are no further questions, we
respectfully ask that you reverse the decision of the
Ninth Circuit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the case in the
