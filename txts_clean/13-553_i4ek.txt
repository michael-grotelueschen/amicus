ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. BRASHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BRASHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The 4-R Act does not make railroads the most
favored taxpayers.  It instead balances the needs of
carriers, shippers and the general public.  Our position
in this case does balance those interests and CSX's
position does not.  On the comparison class issue, we
think the rules is this, and that's that courts should
compare the taxation of railroads to the taxation of the
mass of other businesses in the State with a focus on
whether a State is targeting or singling out railroads
for a tax that the general mass of other businesses do
not have to pay.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it said that -- it
said that in -- in (b)(1), and it doesn't say that in
(b)(4).
MR. BRASHER:  Right.  I -- but I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Another tax that
discriminates is all it says, whereas in (1) it said "as
R value" -- "then the ratio that the assessed value of
other commercial and industrial property in the same
assessment jurisdiction."
MR. BRASHER:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're so specific there
and -- and in (4) they just say another tax that
discriminates against the rail carrier.
MR. BRASHER:  But I think the question is
whether there's any reason to read (b)(4) to require a
comparison class that is different than the one in
(b) -- (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3).
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah.  There's a good
reason that they didn't spell out a specific comparison
class.
MR. BRASHER:  Well, I don't think that --
that is a sufficient reason because I think that the
comparison class that is spelled out in (b)(1), (b)(2),
and (b)(3), if you apply it in (b)(4), it ensures that
railroads are being treated fairly by tying them to a
broad enough mass of politically influential taxpayers
to keep their rates fair.  And the competitor class here
that -- CSX has proposed makes very little sense in
the text of the statute.
I mean, it also, it doesn't really make
sense in light of what this Court said in CSX 1 where
the Court said that, at the very least, we should be
looking at similarly situated taxpayers.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, General, I think on --
on this question, CSX 1, I think your reasoning flies
straight into the face of it, because CSX 1 talks about
the notion that (1) through (3) is very different from
(4) and that you can't -- this is just along the lines
of what Justice Scalia says -- that you can't draw
anything about the meaning of (4) from (1) through (3)
given that they clearly -- they use different language,
they're directed towards different things.
MR. BRASHER:  Well, I think -- I think the
question here is -- is whether you should be looking at
general businesses or whether you should be looking at
CSX's handpicked class of competitors.  And we made the
textual argument that that's the only thing that the
text provides for.  But I also think --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why -- why do you
say handpicked?  I -- I -- they're in the business of
transporting goods, motor carriers are and railroads
are.
MR. BRASHER:  Well, because in this
particular situation, CSX is comparing itself to motor
carriers and water carriers, but is not comparing itself
to, for example, airlines or pipelines, which also
compete with respect to CSX in transportation.
But I think -- I think there's no reason to
necessarily presume that competitors are similarly
situated, especially for the purposes of State taxation.
I mean, Amazon and Walmart are competitors, but for
State taxation, they are not similarly situated.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if they're not
similarly situated, then the railroad loses.
MR. BRASHER:  That's right.  And I think --
I think for the purposes of this tax --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's a
different question than saying what class they should be
compared to.
MR. BRASHER:  I don't think so.  Because I
think -- I think the question is -- is -- at the very
least, the question is what the comparison class should
be, and I think that CSX tells us at the very least,
they should be similarly situated to.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, you see, when you say
"similarly situated," and I think that's right, but that
seems to go to your second argument, which is, look,
they're not similarly situated because there's another
tax that falls upon motor carriers that doesn't fall
upon railroads, and that seems to me completely fair
and -- but -- but not on the first question.
MR. BRASHER:  Well, let me -- let me explain
briefly on how I think it does go to the first question,
which is that we're talking about a sales and use tax,
which is a tax on a transaction.  It's a tax on a
transaction for the purchase of tangible property.  And
so the comparison class here should at least include the
many businesses that also pay that tax  on the items
that they buy for their business.  And railroads are no
more similarly situated to their competitors than they
are to every other business in the State that is also
paying the tax when it buys items that it needs for its
business.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the problem is that,
generally, one thinks of sales and use taxes as flip
sides of each other.  But here, the basis of a
comparison is not quite similar.  Because in one it
measures what you buy, whether you use the gas in State
or out of State, and the other meant -- measures only
what you use in Alabama.  So there is a dissimilarity in
the comparison that's not the norm.
MR. BRASHER:  Right.  So -- so if you put
the comparison class issue aside and you look at the
comparison of the -- of the tax that the railroads pay and
the tax that the truckers pay, I think that they are
comparable in the sense that -- that those are the taxes
that they pay on diesel fuel.  And they're comparable
really in two ways.  As a practical matter, they are the
taxes that -- that both of these entities are paying on
diesel.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The circuit below said
that was fortuitous and that at some point that could
change.
MR. BRASHER:  Well, I'm saying that as a
practical matter, they're -- they're the taxes that are
paid by these entities on diesel.  And as a legal
matter, the exemption that Alabama is providing to the
truckers is because they are paying the other tax on the
same gallon of diesel.
JUSTICE ALITO:  On the -- on the comparator
issue, suppose that railroads and trucks used exactly
the same fuel all the time, no difference whatsoever,
and suppose that Alabama taxed the fuel purchased by the
railroads but not by the trucks.  Would there be a
violation then?
MR. BRASHER:  Our position would be that,
no, there would not be a violation on the comparison
class issue as long as the general mass of businesses
are still paying the same tax rate.  And the -- and the
reason I say that is because if you link the railroad's
taxation to the general mass of other businesses in the
State, then they're not paying an unfair tax rate.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that result is
consistent with the purpose of this statute?
MR. BRASHER:  Yes.  And -- and the reason I
say that is because the 4-R Act was an omnibus bill.  It
did many things.  It, for example, appropriated almost
$2 billion for -- for subsidies to the railroad
industry.  But with this particular provision, what
Congress was getting at was it was trying to prevent
States from singling out or targeting railroads for
taxes, which, quite frankly, States have been doing for
years.  And so that was the harm that Congress was
trying to prevent and that is a harm that would be
prevented if you used the general class --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but they wanted
to prop up -- they wanted to support the rail industry
in a number of ways.  And it seems odd to say in a -- in
a situation where they were giving them this much money,
they still wanted to expose them to unfair competition
by States that want to give other modes of
transportation a tax benefit, but not to them.
MR. BRASHER:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And their --
that's -- their economic viability depends upon how
they're faring with respect to their competitors, not
how they're, you know, faring with respect to, you know,
an agricultural conglomerate in the State.
MR. BRASHER:  Well, ultimately, railroads
are competing against other railroads.  But I think
that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no.  They
compete against trucks, too.
MR. BRASHER:  Well -- well, I think -- I
think there's some -- to a certain extent that they do
compete, but to a certain extent they're also
complementary forms of transportation.  If there were
only trucks, they would be fine without railroads, but
the railroads couldn't exist without truckers.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You really -- you want --
you -- you want us to write an opinion to say railroads
generally do not compete with trucking companies?
That -- you want that to be the opening line of our
opinion?
MR. BRASHER:  No.  No.  I -- I think the
opening line of your opinion should be that courts
should compare the taxation of railroads to the taxation
of the general mass of other businesses with a focus on
whether a State is singling out those businesses for a tax
that railroads --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then fine.  Why don't
you have a kerosene tax?  Everybody pays 8 percent
except for railroads.  They have to pay 20 percent.
Okay?  Now, it turns out that the only people who use
kerosene besides railroads are ice-cream wagons.  Okay?
Isn't the comparison -- nobody else uses it.  So
wouldn't you in that situation compare the railroads to
the ice-cream wagons?  That's not the general.  That
just happens that the State thought of a way of getting
the railroads.
So -- well, I would say, I guess that last
thing is to think, we know you're clever, State tax
authorities, and you'll figure out a million ways to do
this, but if whatever way you figure out discriminates
against the railroads, you lose.  So why have a -- a
general class, a competitor class or some other class
that (4) is a catchall?
MR. BRASHER:  Well, the why is because I
think the goal should be here to create some kind of
balance that actually gives enough ex ante guidance --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what about my case,
then, when you say balance, et cetera?  Who wins?
MR. BRASHER:  Well, I think -- I think
ultimately, the railroads would probably win that case.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Because we look at all the
tax, all the things, everybody pays 8 percent.  That's
what it says.
MR. BRASHER:  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  But if --
JUDGE BREYER:  But railroads.
MR. BRASHER:  If there was a special tax on
kerosene and --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.
MR. BRASHER:  -- and the only two entities
that -- I mean, that -- that's -- for example, there's
a -- there's a case --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So now we're
comparing the two entities that use kerosene.  We're
not comparing --
JUSTICE SCALIA:
an ice cream wagon anyway?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:
Mr. Brasher, what -- what's
It's -- it's a wagon that
uses kerosene to deliver ice cream.
MR. BRASHER:  But I think -- I think the
main point here is that there are lots of businesses in
Alabama that are paying the sales tax on the items that
they need for their business, and there are also lots of
businesses that are paying the sales tax on the diesel
fuel when they need diesel fuel for their businesses.
So manufacturers, mining companies, construction
companies, timber companies, those businesses are the
kinds of businesses that the railroads should be
compared to because that prevents them from being
treated unfairly.
JUSTICE ALITO:  On the question of diesel
fuel, I -- I got the impression -- this just an
informational question -- but I got the impression from
briefs that diesel fuel is diesel fuel except some of it
is dyed.  But is that -- is that true?  Is it not the
case that the dyed diesel fuel has a higher sulfur
content than the clear diesel fuel and therefore costs
less?
MR. BRASHER:  It's my understanding that
they are chemically the same.  That -- that the law is
that the only difference between clear diesel fuel and
dyed diesel fuel is that dyed diesel fuel is diesel fuel
that has been indelibly dyed.  So it's my understanding
that they are chemically the same.
It could be that the United States
government regulates those uses differently through some
kind of environmental regulation, but I'm not
aware of that.
But I think -- I think what the -- setting
the comparison class issue aside, what the district
court did here is exactly what this Court told it to do
when the Court remanded in -- in CSX 1, and that's it
looked at our justifications, it found that they had
nothing to do with railroads, and it also found that the
railroads weren't practically disadvantaged by the kind
of treatment that they were getting and they weren't
practically disadvantaged with respect to truckers,
because the truckers are paying a higher tax on the
years at issue here.  And the railroads could pay that
tax ultimately if they wanted to, but they don't want to
because they realize that they're actually paying a
lower tax rate on their diesel.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, one of the things
that Mr. Phillips talks about is he -- he makes the
point that this is a very hard inquiry to carry out and
that the experience of courts, when they try to do this
in commerce cases, shows that.  So what's your answer to
that?
MR. BRASHER:  Well, the -- the inquiry that
we're asking the Court to perform is not difficult at
all, and the district court performed it in one
paragraph of its decision, which is you simply compare
the taxes that we are imposing on diesel fuel for the
truckers versus the taxes that the railroads are paying
on the same item.
And this is inherent in CSX's complaint in
this case where CSX is asking the courts to compare its
taxes that it is paying on diesel fuel to the taxes that
its competitors are paying on diesel fuel.  And so it's
inconsistent for CSX to be arguing that that's the
comparison and inquiry the courts should make, but at
the same time, courts can't make that inquiry.
And once again, as -- as a purely legal
matter, the tax exemption that we're talking about here
is  in the same part of the code that imposes the tax
that the truckers have to pay.  And the exemption reads,
it says if you pay the tax on clear diesel -- if you pay
the fuels tax that Alabama imposes, then you don't pay
any other tax imposed by State law.  And so, as a purely
legal matter --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're -- you -- are you
representing on the behalf of the State that the
railroads could pay the motor vehicle tax --
MR. BRASHER:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- if they chose?
MR. BRASHER:  Yes.  And that was our
position in this Court in 2009 and it's -- it's a clear
reading of Alabama law because the reason the truckers
are getting the exemption is because they're paying the
other tax.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They use the same type
of diesel?
MR. BRASHER:  The truckers use clear diesel,
which is chemically identified -- identical to the dyed
diesel that the railroads use.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can they use --
MR. BRASHER:  Oh, I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- according to -- in
Federal law, can the railroads use the undyed --
MR. BRASHER:  As far as I'm aware, there is
no prohibition under Federal law.  There is certainly no
prohibition on State law with respect to the railroads
using clear diesel.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But the truckers can't use
the dyed fuel.
MR. BRASHER:  That's correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Why -- why is that?
MR. BRASHER:  Well, it's because -- it's
because the tax on the clear diesel is higher than the
tax on the dyed diesel.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So that would be why they
might not want to, but why --
MR. BRASHER:  No.  No.  I think that's why
States and the Federal government are telling them that
they can't use the dyed diesel.  Because we want them
to --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It's not for environmental
reasons?  Are you sure about that?
MR. BRASHER:  I don't think so.  I mean,
it's certainly the way this -- certainly the way this
started is -- is we started with a taxing scheme that
required truckers to pay what -- what at the time, at
least, was much, much higher than railroads were paying.
And so we wanted to prevent truckers from using the dyed
diesel.
The whole reason why we have clear diesel
and dyed diesel to begin with is -- is so that we could
support this taxing scheme where we're imposing a
per-gallon tax on the truckers.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, talk about the
water carriers.
MR. BRASHER:  Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you going to suggest
that if they stop at a dock and eat a meal, they can't
be charged a sales tax?
MR. BRASHER:  Well, I think the district
court said two things about water carriers and neither
one makes sense, which is that the railroads didn't show
any practical disadvantage with respect to water
carriers because the only evidence in the record with
respect to water carriers is that they make up 1 percent
of the market for shipping goods from one part of
Alabama to another.
And -- and to go back to the complementary
point that I was making earlier, the district court
also, quite rightly, refused to simply assume that
treating water carriers with this minor preference was
going to harm railroad's bottom line, and this is why:
Is that, for all we know, a perfectly reasonable
assumption would be if our tax pretreatment for water
carriers actually increase the amount of water commerce
coming into Alabama, that would also increase the amount
of commerce that railroads are  moving from docks to
get to somewhere else in Alabama.
So in light of the fact that there was
essentially no evidence at all about water carriers to
show that railroads actually suffered some practical
disadvantage, I think the district court's reasoning --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, there is a
practical disadvantage; they paid a tax that the water
carriers haven't --
MR. BRASHER:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and it makes the
water carriers more competitive against them.
MR. BRASHER:  Well, and my point, I think
the district court was right to say, well, they're only
1 percent of the market for moving goods from one part
of the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but under your
argument then, you could give tax exemptions to many
businesses and then those businesses would grow and give
more goods to the railroads.  So that's just simply --
that can't work.
MR. BRASHER:  Well, I think -- I think -- my
point being is that if the only evidence is what the
railroads put into the record here, the district court
doesn't have to assume that they're going to be
practically disadvantaged.  CSX's position in this case
would mean that if the State offered a tax exemption or
tax incentive to a single competitor of a railroad, to a
single company that just operates in a single city of
the State, that CSX and every other railroad operating
in the State would get exactly the same preference.  And
we could be offering that preference to a single company
that costs the State $10,000, but to offer the same
preference to the railroads would cost $40 million.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why doesn't Alabama
tax the fuel purchased by the water -- water carriers?
It's kind of curious.  Is it -- is it just a remnant of
an old understanding of the extent of -- of the State's
power?
MR. BRASHER:  Yes.  I -- I think it's for
historical reasons with respect to the taxation of
interstate commerce by water.  The provision at issue
here actually taxes Alabama's own citizens when
they're -- when they're moving goods by water commerce
from one part of the State to the other.  So we're
taxing that -- those transportation.  We're only not
taxing it when someone moves goods from Alabama to some
other State.
And that's another reason why I think the
water carriers are largely irrelevant, because the
railroads here aren't even asking for the same tax
treatment that we give to water carriers in that -- in
the sense that they don't want to pay taxes at all.
They don't want some kind of different treatment based
on whether they're moving goods from one part of the
State to the other.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You -- you tax the
water carriers when they move within Alabama?
MR. BRASHER:  We tax intrastate shipments.
So the exemption at issue here is only for the movement
of goods in interstate commerce.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is that -- how
is that consistent with the statute admitting Alabama to
the Union, which says the water -- the first time -- the
water will remain -- forever remain public highways
without any tax, duty, impost or toll?
MR. BRASHER:  Well, fortunately, we haven't
had that litigation, but --
(Laughter.)
MR. BRASHER:  -- but I think -- but I
think -- to go -- to go to your point, Justice Alito, I
mean, the historical treatment of water carriers is
there's been historical preferences for water shipments
by interstate commerce in this country ever since it was
a country.  And so that's the reason why we have this
preference in our tax code.
JUSTICE BREYER:  You think that when we send
it back, if we did and you won, that suppose you win on
the ground that there is no fixed group, it depends on
the case who you compare them with.  So here, compare
them with the trucks.
Now, you'll say, as you do say, that we have
a very good reason for treating them differently.  The
trucks have to pay this extra tax for the fuel, and
railroads don't.  My guess is, and this is what I want
to know, that they'll come back and say, but the reason
that they pay that extra tax is to support highways, and
railroads don't use highways.  And then you'll have to
figure out whether that is discrimination or isn't
discrimination, because indeed they do pay a higher tax.
But it is to go to highways, and does that count or not?
Now, my question, I don't think you can
answer that -- if you want to, try.  I'm really just
interested, is that likely to be the shape of the
argument or not?
MR. BRASHER:  Well, I think the district
court already addressed that.  So you have a district
court opinion in this case which found in our favor
applying the competitive comparison class, and like I
said, put the comparison class to one side doing
effectively what the court told it to do in CSX 1.  So
the district court already addressed that and decided
that when the State is -- is using tax revenue for
general public purposes, it really is irrelevant how the
State is raising that revenue.  We could have a yearly
appropriation for highway maintenance and it would be
the same thing as having a dedicated source of funding
for highway maintenance.  And it's not as if the
truckers are paying for all of Alabama's highway
maintenance.  We're also taxing other people in the
State to add money to that to build highways.  And so
ultimately, I think the district court was right that
that's just a red herring --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the trucker tax is not
directed to highways exclusively?  It goes into a
general fund?
MR. BRASHER:  No, the -- the fuel tax that
the truckers are paying is set aside for highway
construction, highway maintenance.  But my point is that
it's -- it's not as if the truckers are the only ones
paying for the highways to be built in Alabama; it's not
as if the truckers are the only ones using the highways.
We'd have to find some funds to build highways
regardless of how we get them.
And also, CSX's own expert, when testifying
in this case, agreed that railroads also benefit from
roads, railroads also benefit from schools, and these
are the kind of indirect benefits that the State has to
provide as part of a general public purposes of the
State.
But I think the real problem with CSX's
proposed rule in this case is that it provides zero ex
ante guidance to State policymakers about how to
structure a tax system in a way that doesn't
discriminate against railroads, but does actually
require them to pay their fair share.  And I think
that's what the Court should focus on.
And the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in this
case in Footnote 5 of the opinion, the Eleventh Circuit
recognized that even if we were requiring truckers to
pay four times as much as we were requiring the
railroads to pay, the Eleventh Circuit would still find
that we are discriminating against railroads in that
circumstance.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my
time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Goldenberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
We disagree with Petitioners as to the
comparison class issue and agree with Petitioners as to
the issue of the alternative and comparable tax on the
motor carriers.  I'd like to start with the comparison
class issue if I could, although I'd like to devote time
to both of those issues.
With respect to the comparison class issue,
I do think, as Justice Scalia's question indicated, that
the omission of a specific comparison class in (b)(4) is
extremely telling here when there is such a specific
comparison class set forth in (b)(1) through (3).  And I
also think it's very important that I think there is a
very good rational reason why Congress would have wanted
to leave the comparison class issue open with respect to
(b)(4) and not limit the comparison class in that arena
to other commercial and industrial entities.  And the
reason is this:  With respect to property taxes, I think
Congress can rest assured that virtually all commercial
and industrial entities are going to have real property
and that if you're grouping the railroads with those
entities and you're doing something unduly burdensome,
those entities are going to speak up, they're going to
use their political power, they're going to complain in
some way.  And so it's protective of the railroads to
have that kind of comparison class.
With respect to other kinds of taxation,
non-property taxation, I don't think you can say that
the same thing is true.  And specifically with respect
to diesel fuel, I think, and I'm just hypothesizing
here, but it is very likely that there are many
commercial and industrial taxpayers who either don't use
diesel fuel at all or use very little diesel fuel in
their businesses, such that a tax on diesel fuel that
applies to them is a very small burden for them.  And if
you are going to count on the fact that they're going to
speak up if there is a very burdensome diesel fuel tax
that's laid on them and on railroads, I don't think that
that holds true.  And that's a situation in which, if
it's really railroads and their competitors who are
using the diesel fuel, then the competitors are the
comparison class that you ought to be looking to.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Goldenberg, could I ask,
you know, in one set of cases maybe a railroad is saying
we're being singled out.  In another set of cases a
railroad comes in and says no, we're not being singled
out but our competitors are being treated better than we
are.  Are there any other kinds of cases out there or is
it mostly just, you know, as compared to the general
taxpayer and as compared to competitors?  Is there any
other way to -- to shape a complaint in this field?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  As far as I'm aware, there
is not.  And I'm not aware of cases that fall into any
other category besides those.  And I think the reason is
that railroads don't make claims that people who aren't
their competitors -- a small group of people who aren't
their competitors are being treated differently than
they are.  Because I think in situations like that it's
very easy for the State to come in and say, here is a
reasonable distinction between those other people and
you, the railroad.
So, for instance, you had a church or a
school that was being exempted from a tax that a
railroad paid, it would be extremely easy for the State
to say, well, churches and schools have socially
beneficial or charitable purposes, they're not involved
in business like railroads, railroads don't compete with
them and so it doesn't harm railroad's financial
stability to have them exempted.
So in some ways the comparison class of
competitors is sort of a proxy for the kinds of reasons
that the State is going to be able to give in order to
distinguish between the allegedly favored and less
favored groups.
I'd also like to point out that I think
there are very serious problems with the singled out or
targeted requirement that the State is espousing here.
And that is that either -- depending on how you apply
it, it's going to be highly manipulatable by the State
or it's going to have major administrability problems,
and let me explain why.
If you have a true singled-out requirement,
so you find that railroads can't win a discrimination
claim under (b)(4) unless they are the only ones who are
subject to a tax, then I think it's extremely easy for
the State to evade any (b)(4) liability whatsoever
simply by grouping together with the railroads some
other entity or set of entities on whom the tax burden
doesn't fall very heavily or a set of entities that's
not very  politically powerful and won't speak up, and in
virtually every case the State will be able to escape
from (b)(4) liability and sort of vitiate that
provision.
If you don't have a true singled-out
requirement, if you have a more kind of amorphous
targeting requirement, then I think you have very
problematic line-drawing issues.  Because it's unclear
whether, if you've got five other entities grouped with
the railroad or ten other entities or 20 other entities,
whether that can -- constitutes targeting and where you
actually draw the line.
And so I think that just applying the
definition of discriminates that this Court laid out in
its decision last time this case was here is actually
much easier to apply, much easier to administer than any
kind of targeted or singled-out requirement.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you about the
second point?  What is your response to CSX's argument
that this is really a very, very difficult comparison to
make?  And so here you have -- you have a formula that
will be beneficial to one side or the other depending on
the price of diesel fuel if, in fact, diesel fuel is
diesel fuel.  But in one case, the tax is on the
purchase of the fuel, in the other case, the tax is on
the use of the fuel.  They're used for different
purposes.  And, you know, it's easy for -- for us to
say, well, okay, go back and, you know, do it, District
Court or court of appeals, but how would you do -- how
would you resolve those issues?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I think --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is it a manageable
comparison to make?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I think with respect to
both of them there are -- I can explain why I think the
taxes are comparable despite the arguments that have
been raised.
But I just want to back up and, for a
second, make a larger point which is, I think what the
lower court has done here and what courts of appeals
have done generally, is just sort of throw up their
hands and say under no possible circumstances could we
ever compare taxes, could we ever look beyond the face
of the challenged tax.  And that can't possibly be
correct.
This Court, in its dormant commerce  clause
cases, in its cases about discrimination against the
Federal government and those with whom it deals, does
just that.  And there is no reason why the rule should
be narrower here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Although I do think that
one of Mr. Phillips' point is that maybe
those cases don't fill one with confidence.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think there is a
long history, particularly in the dormant commerce
clause area, of the Court looking to alternative and
comparable taxes.  I think the Court has taken a very
narrow view of what constitutes a substantially
equivalent taxable item or event, for instance, and I
don't disagree that that view could apply in this area.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you say it's doable,
so can you address --
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- any of the points that I
mentioned?  Does it matter that one -- that the -- the
revenue from one is dedicated to a single purpose rather
than going into the -- into the general pot?  Does it
matter that one is a tax on purchase and the other is a
tax on use?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I'm happy to talk about
each of those.  With respect to the first one, the
purpose for which the tax revenue is being used, I don't
think that that plays into the analysis under (b)(4)
about whether there is a discrimination in imposing the
tax.  There may be, perhaps, in some dimension,
discrimination in how the State uses its tax revenues,
but that's not what the statute is about.  This statute
is about the tax burden that's imposed --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, wait a minute, wait a
minute.  Why?  The obvious case which is right here is
that the railroads say, you're taxing us at a higher
rate.  The State's response is, true, but we do it
because the trucks pay even more for their diesel fuel.
There's a higher tax.  Their response is, but the reason
that they do that is because they use highways and we
want to pay for those.
Now, in terms of just pure logic, that is a
point; isn't it?  And so that -- that's what I think is
one example of what Justice Alito was driving at.  And
why -- why do you not have to take that into account,
and if you do, how?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I don't think you
have to take it into account.  What I'm suggesting is I
don't think the analysis should go beyond the imposition
of --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- the tax and the tax
burden because of the language of (b)(4) and also
because otherwise you would end up in a very bizarre
situation where you could have a unitary tax that fell
on motor carriers and railroads equally.  There's one
tax provision that says motor carriers and railroads,
you both pay "X" cents per gallon on your fuel and a
railroad could nevertheless come in and claim
discrimination under (b)(4) if the State took that tax
revenue and used it to build roads.  That seems like an
awfully strange result.
It would also mean that you could have the
same tax structure in different states that would be
discriminatory in one state and not discriminatory in
another, depending on how the state spent its revenues.
I also agree with what my friend from
Alabama said with respect to the evidence in the record
here about how the -- the motor carriers aren't being in
some way kind of especially or uniquely benefitted by
the roads, using money to build roads benefits the
general public and it also benefits railroads.
Railroads use trucks to bring freight to and from their
trains and they are part of the system of the state
where everybody needs these roads.  And it may be that
motor carriers benefit a little bit more than other
people, but it is for the general welfare.  That's what
a tax is.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What about the second part,
that it -- does it make a difference taxes on use as
opposed to taxes on sales?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't think it makes a
difference that one is on use and one is on sale.  For
one thing, I do think that as a practical matter those
categories kind of blur together here.  Motor carriers
pay at the pump, which they, I think, experience as a
tax on sales.  Then later, under the International Fuel
Tax Agreement, the State takes the money and  kind of
sends it around in this clearinghouse system to other
states where the fuel may have been used.  But it's not
something that I think the motor carrier necessarily
experiences as different than a sales tax.
And on the other side of the equation, the
railroads do pay -- they're complaining about sales and
use taxes.  My understanding is that railroads generally
purchase their fuel, their diesel fuel, wholesale.  The
definition of "retail sale" in the Alabama tax law says
that when you buy wholesale, what counts as a retail
sale is the withdrawal, use or consumption of the item.
So I think the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about water carriers?
Are you going to say anything about that.
MS. GOLDENBERG:  Certainly.  In our view,
the water carriers issue should be remanded to the court
of appeals in the first instance because it hasn't
addressed the district court's reasons why there is no
discrimination.  We are dubious that the district
court's reasons are correct, but in any event, we'd urge
the Court not to simply decide the water carriers issue
without deciding the alternative and comparable tax
issue because, in that case, we think the state could
just change the statute with respect to water carriers
and all the motor carrier-related issues would remain.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you think that -- that
the ruling, the district court's ruling on the
comparability of the taxes is also dubious?
MS. GOLDENBERG:  The district court's ruling
on --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The district court found
that these were complementary or --
MS. GOLDENBERG:  No.  We agree that the
district court analyzed the comparability of the taxes
correctly and did so with the agreement of the parties
as to how they should be compared.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Let me begin by debunking a -- a statement
that gets repeated often in this litigation which is
that somehow the railroads are here seeking a
most-favored nation opportunity.
The truth is Alabama -- in Alabama, we pay
$10 million a year in sales taxes.  We pay taxes every
time we buy gasoline or -- or fuel that we use on road.
We do that all the time.  We have no quarrel with that,
we don't have any objection to that.
What we do --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why do you bother?  If
you're going to be taxed at $10 million, why don't you
buy it in the adjoining state before you cross the
Alabama lines?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, there -- there
are ways of doing business, but we also are entitled to
the protections under the 4-R Act which is designed,
candidly, to ensure that our financial stability which
means that we ought to always be in a position where we
can approach all of our business decisions in the most
efficient way and hopefully put ourselves in a position
in order to compete against the motor carriers and
the -- and the water carriers.
And that's precisely what the comparison
class takes you to, which is, it's all well and good to
say that, you know, the statute addresses targeting.
And that's fine, and that's clearly right because that's
what Congress undeniably saw primarily in the count of
(b)(1) to (b)(3) range, and that's why it identified
this specific class that it was worried about for
targeting.
But when it gets to the point of talking
about every other form of discrimination, another tax
that discriminates, in that context it only makes sense
to think about this in the context of your competitors,
because Congress's other purpose in this was to ensure
that there would be financial stability, that the
railroads would, once again, be able to operate on their
own.
And, obviously, to the extent that you've
authorized the states to choose, for whatever reason, to
benefit motor and water carriers routinely to the
detriment of the railroads, that completely undermines
it.
So it seems to me, and -- and my colleague
from the Solicitor General's Office has done an
excellent job of sort of going through the various
points on the comparison class, I'm happy to answer any
questions on that further, but I'm more inclined to deal
with the justifications.
On the justifications --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, just on the
comparison class, can't you let the water carriers go?
I mean, it's a very tiny percentage that's at issue.
It's governed by the admission to the Union.  They
sometimes touch down in Alabama, they sometimes don't.
And I don't want to have the case up here a third time.
MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- I won't take that last
comment personally, Mr. Chief Justice.
The -- I mean, they have 1 percent of the
market; we have 6 percent of the market.  That's --
that's -- that's still an important competitor of ours.
They stipulated -- it's in their stipulation, these are
a major competitor, we compete in a major way on the
basis of the fuel that we use.
We're talking about a statute at the time
that was designed to ensure against the nonsurvival of
the railroad industry.  I think the idea -- first of
all, Congress knows how to incorporate a de minimus
exception.  It did it in the -- in the component dealing
with (b)(1), (b)(3) as it gets applied.  It didn't do it
in (b)(4).  And so, therefore, as much as I would
prefer -- and actually, I can get you out of coming back
here, because if you say that the water carriers are --
are, in fact, within the class to be evaluated, there is
no justification put forward.  The Eleventh Circuit is
100 percent correct about that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if there's one
water carrier, you win?  Or if there's one odd method of
transportation, you win?
MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That sounds like
most-favored nation to me.
MR. PHILLIPS:  No, but that's not -- that's
not the way the case comes here.  The case comes here
with a stipulation that water carriers are a major
competitor of ours.  It's not that there's only one of
them.  It's that there is a significant amount of
traffic that flows.
We have 6 percent --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The district court --
MR. PHILLIPS:  -- they have 1 percent.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The district court
appeared in its opinion -- and I -- and I may be wrong
-- to say that you, in fact, had not proven that they
were really competitors.  It seemed to say you had not
shown the competitive impact.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that's what I took
it to be saying, that you hadn't shown that they really
do take resources away from you.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, first of all, that's
inconsistent with the stipulation.  But, two, the
district court got it a 100 percent wrong.  Even as
Judge Cox, in his dissenting opinion, said in the
Eleventh Circuit, which is that we satisfy our -- our
obligation to demonstrate the prima facie case by
showing that the water carriers are flatly exempt on the
face of the statute.  That's facial discrimination.  It
becomes the state's burden at that point to justify it.
And if the state had wanted to come in and
say, oh, sure we can justify it because they're not
really competitors in some sense, that would be fine.
But that's not their stipulation.  Their stipulation is
that this is a major competitor of ours and on -- on a
subject matter, fuel, that is a major portion of the way
in which we compete against each other.
So I think, Your Honor, the easiest way not
to have to see me again -- at least representing CSX in
this context -- is to say water carriers count, it's
their stipulation, we shouldn't have had to get to this
issue in any event because I don't think it was in the
cert petition, and there's really no reason to go ahead
and try to sort out the thorny issues that Justice Alito
was talking about as to how you're going to try, from
here on, to apply the comparability standard in this
particular case.
Alabama wants to do it in a very
simpleminded way, how much are you paying today and how
much are they paying today, and if it's close enough,
that's good enough for government work.
The problem with that is, is that all of the
case law that deals with comparability -- and this
Court's decisions have run about as far away from
notions of comparability as you can since it first
adopted the rule to deal with this straight, strict,
sales tax and use tax, which really are the mirror image
of each other.  Ever since then, every other tax has
been analyzed under those standards.  The Court has
said, no, no, that's not the way we're going to do --
we're not going to get into that comparability analysis.
And I -- I would most -- most particularly
point you in the direction of Professor Hellerstein --
Hellerstein's brief where he describes -- he says, look,
if it's true comparability, that's one thing.  But we're
talking here about taxes that are -- the taxes that are
not mutually exclusive proxies for each other.  They're
imposed on different activities at different rates and
for different purposes.  And how we're going to ask a
district court to say these are sufficiently similar --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm -- I'm just not
moved by the purpose part for the following reason.  I
think your brother was absolutely correct that how the
state uses its tax revenues is a personal decision by
it.  It could have put all of the money into the
treasury and said, but we're going to calculate what we
spend on highways according to this formula, because we
want to do it.  That's exactly what they've done here.
They could say we're going to beautify the
route for railroads, and we're going to give them X
amount of money to do that from our state treasury, and
we're calculating it a little bit from the fuel they
bought.
MR. PHILLIPS:  But, Justice Sotomayor, I
think it's a more -- it should be a more nuanced
analysis than that.  And -- and I -- and I disagree with
my friend from the Solicitor General's office on -- on
this particular point.  Because when -- when you're
talking about the use that's put to it, there's no
question -- we -- we couldn't bring a claim that says,
we're -- we're taxed exactly the same in all ways, you
know.  It's two sales taxes, one's called a sales tax
against railroads and the other is called a sales tax
against motor carriers, and -- and come back in and say,
but you're going to use that money for their benefit and
not for our benefit.  That -- we couldn't make that
claim, that -- no doubt about that, and we've never made
a claim like that.
But it is -- the situation is reversed.
They have created an exemption for motor carriers.  It
is now their burden to justify, in all respects
consistent with the overall purposes of the statute,
that exemption.  And there, it seems to me, it is fair
game for us to say, wait a second, what are you going to
use that money for.  You're using that money to benefit
the -- the -- the motor carriers.  Now, we pay money to
that, and we benefit that -- we benefit from that, too,
when we actually use the highways.  But what
this money is designed for and what the motor carriers
want is more taxes like that because that way they
improve the quality of the roads, and it helps them to
be a better competitor against us.
It seems to me, in a situation where you're
trying to justify discrimination against us designed to
eliminate the possibility of undermining our ability to
compete, whether or not that the State uses that money
for to undermine our ability to compete, should still be
fair game under (b)(4).  And that's why I would urge the
Court to read Professor Hellerstein's brief and analyze
the complexities that are embedded in the regime the
State asks you to go to.  If you don't want to go that
far, then I'd ask you to simply say that water carriers
is enough on a basis to say this is unconstitutional and
affirm the Eleventh Circuit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, just to get
back to them, it's 1 percent and 6 percent of what?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Of the interstate business.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Interstate business.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Did -- did the court of
appeals deal with your point you just made about the --
a special purpose of the extra tax that the truckers
pay?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Not in -- not in precisely
those terms.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What I'm trying to figure
out is -- is how are they supposed to conduct this
comparison analysis?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, that -- no, but that is
exactly --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What they did is they
didn't do it.
MR. PHILLIPS:  No, no.  But that's exactly
what the Eleventh Circuit said --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.
MR. PHILLIPS:  -- is that once you open that
box and get into the business, all other kinds of things
that Professor Hellerstein tells you you have to look
at, the inquiry becomes limitless and that the
carrier --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, fine.  But suppose
that the -- suppose the reason that the truckers have to
pay this extra tax is not to go into a fund that
benefits them.  Suppose, indeed, it's to go into a fund
that benefits railroads.  I mean, so -- so doesn't --
you have to -- you have to say whether or not -- you
wouldn't say that no matter what the purpose of this
extra tax is don't consider it, would you?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, what I would say is,
when you know that the taxes are not mutually exclusive
proxies, I mean, the question is -- I don't think this
Court is going to have any -- any ability to sort of sit
down here and try to come up with a set of standards of
comparability.
What I would ask the Court to look at is in
this case what do we know?  That these are taxed on --
these are imposed on different activities, the privilege
of using the roads as opposed to a sales tax, at
different rates, 15 cents versus 4 percent which, in the
last four years, we know have -- have been to the
disadvantage of the railroads, and in this case, for
different purposes.
The fact that there may be another case in
which they decide to make them for the same purpose,
that would still not modify the core of what the
comparability analysis requires, this -- which remains
enormously complicated and not -- and, to my mind at
least, not worth the candle.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course it isn't.  You
won.  And -- and the -- the -- and what --
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, even if I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What's worry -- what's
worrying me is --
MR. PHILLIPS:  For an academic I would
say the same thing.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- you know, but it's
not -- it's -- State taxes are so complex and -- and
that they didn't even have a -- they didn't really have
a chance -- they could have, but they didn't, go into
the what is this extra tax the truckers pay, is it
comparable, and that's a good reason for having them pay
less sales tax, or does it really have nothing to do
with the price of anything and, therefore, it's a bad
reason and, therefore, you win.  They didn't consider
that.  That's what's worrying me.  And if I send it
back, if I -- if we do that, not only do we have to do
it, they have to go through all this again.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  We're going to have to tell
them just what to do, which that sounds worse to me,
and -- and, moreover, it may come back here again.
MR. PHILLIPS:  We can -- we can -- I
understand all that.  But -- but it seems to me, Justice
Breyer, everything you just said there should lead to
the conclusion that the right answer here is to affirm
and -- and to do so because they had the opportunity to
put in evidence.  They -- they followed a simpleminded
approach, as of day one, there is -- this is the amount
of money that's being paid, that's close enough for me,
we're done, as opposed to the true comparability
analysis that would be required.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do we do that?  How
do we do that with -- with the water carriers?  I -- I
do see your point with respect to the motor vehicle
drivers because there the entire argument was around
comparability and was it comparable.  And the court
said -- but it basically said we're not going to get
into it.  If they call it something else, we won't do
it.
MR. PHILLIPS:  But --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It didn't quite say what
you said.
MR. PHILLIPS:  No, but I -- I think, one,
the Court can certainly recognize that what I said is
precisely part of the problem that comes out of the
comparability analysis.  Once you get into evaluating
different purposes --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now -- now you want a
really broad rule that says you've got to -- you've got
to use the same label on every tax, States.  You've got
to treat competitors with the same label all of the
time.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it's the same tax.  I
mean, I -- I don't know.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well --
MR. PHILLIPS:  At the end of the day, that
is the rule I'm hoping for.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If they -- if they had
done a mirror excise tax, you would have been happy?
MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- yes, I would not have a
complaint on that score.  On the other -- but just to be
clear, Justice Sotomayor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's  still a
comparability issue.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We've always said --
MR. PHILLIPS:  But it's a single compare --
comparability issue.  The problem here is if you go down
the road of sufficient justification, it is an
extraordinarily complicated comparability issue.  And I
would hope the Court wouldn't want to go down that road
more than because I won this case, but more
fundamentally, the Court doesn't have to go down that
road because there is a major competitor and there was
never a justification given for that reason.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  On the water
carriers it never addressed the -- the court below never
addressed -- the Eleventh Circuit never addressed the
reasons that were given.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, that's because the
reasons they were given were completely -- well, the --
the concurring -- the concurring Judge Cox did.  He said
those reasons don't justify it because all he said was
you -- and -- and if you look at the district court's
rationale, it -- it won't get you home either because,
again, first it said it's our burden to demonstrate that
there's -- that there's been an injury.  That's not our
burden.  We satisfied our burden, and the Eleventh
Circuit said that when we -- when we came forward.
Then -- so it was there -- therefore, with
an exemption, their burden to show why.  The only thing
they came up with was -- or what the only thing the
district court bought was, well, we hadn't proved --
once again putting the burden on us -- that this would
be constitutional in all circumstances.  That's not
enough to justify allowing an exemption like that to
remain in place.
And -- and essentially the court of appeals
basically said there is no rational justification for
it.  There's none -- not been one put forward.  It --
it's a relic of 50 years ago, and that's not a
sufficient -- I would hope that's not a sufficient
justification in the meaning of the Court's prior
opinion.
If there are no other further questions,
I'll let you make --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  So what do you do
with -- the -- the district judge did make the
comparison between the motor carrier tax, and -- and
you -- you say that -- that comparison was inadequate
because?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Because it didn't -- it
didn't take into account the rest of the analysis.  It
didn't deal with the purpose; it didn't deal with the
nature of the tax.  All it said was that at a particular
arbitrary point in time, the amounts in -- the amounts
weren't all that different.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it also said that if
you don't engage in that kind of comparison, then you're
going to end up with the railroad becoming the most
favored taxpayer.
MR. PHILLIPS:  But that's just a conclusion,
and it's not -- it's not true.  Because it is always
available to the State to put our competitors in the
same position we are in.  And if for some reason that's
not possible, then that might well be a sufficient
justification for some differential tax.
But it is all -- in this context, it is
clearly possible.  There's no problem, you know,
removing the exemption for the -- for the sales tax that
the water carriers pay.  There is no problem imposing a
4 percent sales tax on the clear fuel that the motor
carriers pay.  If they do that, we're done.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I might have -- I
might have missed it, but why isn't it a sufficient
justification for different treatment of the water
carriers that the statute admitting Alabama to the union
said they couldn't tax traffic on the river?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think because the --
the chain -- because the Constitution has changed.
First of all, I don't know what --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The Constitution
might have changed, but the statute didn't.
MR. PHILLIPS:  But I don't know that that's
a tax on the river because that could just be a tax
that's designed to deal with, like, a toll road.  So I
don't know what that language actually refers to.  This
is just a tax on gasoline that's being used to allow you
to get on the river.
So I don't -- I don't know -- I mean, this
is -- given that this wasn't the subject of any scrutiny
by anyone, nor put forward in any serious way, I
don't -- I mean, that -- I don't think it's a legitimate
justification.
But -- but in any event, it's still
available to Alabama.  Well, I -- I suppose you could
say Alabama would take the risk if it -- if it removes
the exemption that somebody would bring suit against
them, but I don't think that's a very serious challenge.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So suppose the State taxed
railroads at 4 percent, but then gave them a -- a credit
against what they paid on the highway tax.  Would you be
back in the same position you are now?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Gave an exemption to the --
I'm sorry?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That they gave -- they
gave a deduction for the sales tax against what they've
paid in highway taxes.
MR. PHILLIPS:  So you're talking about the
railroads and what we pay a highway tax?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, so the -- the
truckers.
MR. PHILLIPS:  I just want to make sure I
understand.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I -- I misstated.
They taxed the truckers the same as they tax you, 4
percent.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then they give the
truckers a deduction for whatever they paid in the
highway tax.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, no.  Then I think we'd
be right back to the same -- same boat.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  As -- as I understand the
court of appeals' judgment as to the truckers, the court
of appeals just said it's too complicated, forget it,
we're not even going to look at Alabama's argument.
Now you're here and you're saying, well,
Alabama's argument is too simple.  There's a whole raft
of other things to -- to include in the analysis of
whether that tax on the truckers is, in fact,
comparable.
But the decision that we have before us just
threw up its hands and refused to look at the whole
alternative tax issue.  That seems, to me, a problem for
you, isn't it?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, in the first place,
it's not a problem for me if you decide on the water
carriers.  But even on its own terms, it seems to me
this Court has previously recognized in Snead, in a
similar anti-discrimination provision, that it is simply
not appropriate to do the kind of simple analysis
Alabama proposes here and just say, at the end of the
day, electricity is going to be better off in-state than
out-of-state or out-of-state than in-state so don't
worry about it, we're good.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, doesn't it have to be
appropriate as going in that Alabama can say, here's the
tax that we impose on truckers?  They're really being
treated in the exact same way just under two different
provisions of the tax code, and then it's up to you to
say why that's wrong.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but -- and -- and we
did say why that's wrong.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's not what the
court of appeals said.  The court of appeals did not
say, oh, you know, CSX has convinced us that these are
not comparable taxes.  Instead, what the court of
appeals said is we're not even going to look at whether
they are comparable taxes.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And -- and I
realize -- I recognize a bit of a disconnect there.  But
the reason why they said they weren't going to get
engaged in that inquiry is because the very items I've
identified, the nature of the tax, the purpose of the
tax, the incidence of the tax, are very -- are all
complicated issues and you can go through the rest of
the Hellerstein criteria -- very complicated issues, and
if the State is only going to come in here and try to
defend itself on the basis that at one point in time the
money is pretty close, that's not going to get it done.
And so then the question is -- and this is
where I think the Eleventh Circuit said, look, this is
clearly not enough -- we're not going to go down this
path and so that's the ruling.
Now, if the Court wants to quarrel with
that, at some point, I don't think this is the right
case in which to do that.  First of all, this issue
wasn't presented in the cert petition.  And second of
all, it's -- it's completely unnecessary to resolve this
particular case properly.  You can affirm on at least
two alternative reasons without having to go down the
path of figuring out exactly whether comparability is
worth a candle.
If there are no further questions now, I'll
let you get your lunch.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
General Brasher, you have five minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. BRASHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BRASHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice:
Let me just make a few quick points.  One is
that if you adopt the position that the State's
justifications matter, it's no more difficult to analyze
a justification that has to do with another tax of any
other justification.  As a matter of fact, it's a lot
easier because you can just use math as opposed to
evaluating some other justification.
And the justification with respect to the
truckers is that we are obligated under a series of
interstate agreements, international agreements and
Federal law, to impose a per-gallon tax on the truckers.
And then once you impose that tax on the truckers, the
question arises should you also impose an additional
sales tax on the same transaction as the purchase of
diesel fuel.  And it makes perfect sense for the State
to say, as a policy matter, that we're not going to
double tax the same transaction.
It was surprising to hear my friend talk
about how he would be fine if the State tried to treat
railroads in a way that was the same as truckers,
because that's exactly what the State of Tennessee did
and it found itself in a real quandary that this Court
needs to prevent.  Which is the railroads were arguing
that Tennessee was discriminating against them because
the railroads weren't treated like truckers.  They won
that litigation.  And then -- so Tennessee turned around
and tried to craft a statute that treated railroads
exactly the same way as truckers.  And then the railroad
sued again saying that they were being targeted or
singled out for a tax that no one else had to pay.
And I think that is a necessary implication
of the rule that my friend on the other side is adopting
which is that it is -- it is discrimination to treat
railroads unlike anyone that they particularly say that
they compete with and it's also discrimination to try to
avoid that discrimination.
And the other point I would make is that
we're not talking in this case about a tax on diesel
fuel.  We're talking about a sales tax.  When CSX sends
us a check for their taxes, there is one line and it
says sales tax.  This is how much we pay to the State
basis on sales tax.  And everybody else, all the other
businesses in the State that have to pay the sales tax
on the items that they need for their businesses, are
sending us the same check that says this is what we have
to pay on sales tax.
And with respect to diesel specifically,
manufacturing companies, timber companies, construction
companies, when they send us a check, they -- they say
sales tax and that includes everything else that they
have to pay on the sales tax and the diesel fuel.  And
that money that we're using, that we're collecting by
the sales tax, goes to -- primarily for education, which
is something that the railroads benefit from just like
everyone else in the State.
But ultimately what we're asking the Court
to do is adopt a rule that if we are using the -- the
hand-picked class of competitors, that the courts
actually have to weigh a State's reasons for the
exemptions in its tax code and with a focus on whether
the railroads are suffering any practical disadvantage.
And that's what the Eleventh Circuit refused to do.
That's ultimately what the district court did do.
And I think I disagree with my friend on the
other side about the burden of proof in this case.  It's
always going to be the railroad's burden of proof to
show discrimination.  And I think the district court
applied exactly the right formula for determining that.
Which is -- which is if you're in the zone where you're
using the railroads' competitors as a comparison class,
then you're in that area because you're worried about
whether they're suffering some practical disadvantage
vis-à-vis their competitors.  And so it makes sense only
to strike down a tax if they actually are suffering some
real world practical disadvantage and that's something
that they never showed in this case.
Ultimately, what the Court should do is it
should put itself in the position of a state and local
policy maker who is trying to impose a fair and
non-discriminatory tax scheme that does not discriminate
against railroads but does actually require them to pay
their fair share of taxes.
I think we proposed two rules in this case
that would allow that State policy maker, when he or she
is being lobbied by all sorts of other industry groups
to get tax exemptions, to figure out whether they can
give those tax exemptions without also eliminating the
taxes that a completely separate industry group would
ultimately pay.  And that is that you can use a
comparison class of general other businesses with a
focus on whether railroads are being singled out or you
can say the courts must actually weigh a State's reasons
for the exemptions in its tax code with a focus on
whether railroads are being practically disadvantaged.
Unless the Court has any further
questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Anything you can
give us on barges?
MR. BRASHER:  Well, I would make one point
about that and that the only thing in the record is not
only that they're 1 percent of the market, but that
specific stipulation that we entered into is about the
intrastate market, 1 percent of the intrastate market.
And that's actually where they're taxed.
So the only thing in the record about
barges, it doesn't even go to -- to my friend's
arguments.  And once again, they're not asking for the
same tax treatment as the interstate water carriers.  If
they were, then there would be a lot more litigation on
that point because those water carriers have an
exemption that, like I said, taxes when they're moving
goods from one place to an Alabama to another but
doesn't tax them when they're moving those goods from
Alabama to another state.
So that's the same ship going from one place
in Alabama to another place, paying taxes on its diesel
fuel.  When the same ship goes from Alabama to somewhere
else, it's not.  That's not what the railroads ever
asked for which is the reason why that issue has not
really been litigated in the case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
