CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument

Mr. Casey.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
In this facial challenge to the Michigan
statute, court of appeals rulings that these lawyers have
third party standing and that their potential clients have
a constitutional right to appointed counsel in
discretionary appeals are both wrong.
First, with respect to the standing argument, in
our brief we argue that the respondent attorneys could not
meet any of the criteria for standing. This morning I'd
like to focus on the element of prudential standing that
considers whether there is a hindrance to the ability of a
third party to protect his own -- to protect his own
interest.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- there is an injury in
fact. These lawyers claim that if the State were
compensating for this service and they're on the list to
be appointed, they would have more money in their pockets.
You're not -- you're not challenging that there is an
injury in fact.
MR. CASEY: Yes. In our -- in our brief we have
challenged that. The -- the requirement is that there be
an injury in fact, a concrete and particularized actual or
imminent injury in fact.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you said now you
were going on to the prudential factors, and so I asked
were you recognizing that there was an injury in fact, and
you said no. And -- and why not? Because it seems so
obvious that they would get appointments if the system
were --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I take it you're
reserving it for -- in your -- in your brief.
MR. CASEY: I -- I am not waiving the argument.
I -- I would like to rest on the brief.
But I -- in answer to your question, we believe
yes, there is a likelihood that these lawyers on the list
for appointed counsel will some day -- if they stay on the
list and a case comes up in that county, there is a
likelihood that there will be a case. We submit, however,
that on these facts in this facial challenge, we don't
know how many lawyers are on the list for appointments in
Saginaw County. We don't know how many appeals of this
nature come up. So it may be many years before the
situation arises. This is not a concrete and
particularized actual or imminent injury in fact, and
we've argued that in the brief.
At -- at best, if there is an injury in fact and
if there is -- another factor is the close relationship to
the third party. We believe those are weak at best, and
we've argued in our brief that they don't exist. I think
it is most clear, however, that the criteria concerning
the hindrance to the third party does not exist here.
This is a facial challenge bought by -- brought
by lawyers before the statute took effect, claiming not
that the statute violates their own constitutional rights,
but that it violates the rights of potential future
clients, and that the lawyers will suffer economic harm.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I clarify something about
this case? Are any of the indigent defendants whose
rights the respondent attorneys want to advance -- do any
of those people themselves have standing to bring their
claims in Federal court now?
MR. CASEY: Yes. We argue that there are --
there are three ways that an indigent defendant can bring
this claim themselves without having to rely on an
attorney in this type of case. First, they can bring the
challenge directly through the State courts.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm asking if there are any
individuals now before this Court in this case --
MR. CASEY: No. None of these -- none of these
defendants --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- who would be available and
who would have remedies or standing to bring their claims.
Are we just talking pure hypotheticals here?
MR. CASEY: In this facial challenge, we're
talking about pure hypotheticals. The -- the three named
indigent defendants --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: There were three named
indigents.
MR. CASEY: Correct.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: They were?
MR. CASEY: They were denied counsel.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Denied counsel, and they were
also dismissed at some point down the line?
MR. CASEY: Yes. The -- the Sixth Circuit held
that the Federal court should abstain from deciding their
claims because they could have brought their claims in
their direct State appeals. They raised claims about the
practice of denying counsel before the statute took
effect.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Casey, was it a Younger
abstention --
MR. CASEY: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- with respect to the --
MR. CASEY: The -- the Sixth Circuit en banc
held that under Younger v. Harris, the Federal court
should abstain from deciding the claims of the three
indigent defendants.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that means that the
defendants could never bring this 1983 suit. Only the
lawyers arguably could.
MR. CASEY: No. Younger v. Harris is only --
only defers the time when a proper Federal civil rights
action can be brought. There were -- at the time this
action was brought, there were pending State appeals in
two of the cases. One of the defendants never appealed at
all.
The Sixth Circuit recently issued an opinion
not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't these lawyers
instead of -- instead of trying to sue on their own, why
didn't they just offer their services to -- to these
defendants through the State courts?
MR. CASEY: Your Honor, perhaps opposing counsel
could answer that better than I. We say that is the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's what I don't
understand about -- about the fact that they won't --
won't have the right to counsel. It -- it's at least as
easy for -- for counsel to appear in cases in which
indigents need counsel as it is for counsel to bring their
own lawsuit.
MR. CASEY: That is our point on the standing
issue precisely, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't -- didn't the Michigan
Supreme Court already rule on this issue and said that the
statute was constitutional, that there was no right to
counsel, therefore no possibility of appointing counsel,
paid counsel?
MR. CASEY: That's correct. In -- in 2000, the
-- the -- while this case was pending, the Michigan
Supreme Court issued an opinion, the Bulger decision
that's discussed in the briefs, saying that the practice
of denying appointed counsel was constitutional. The
statute was not in effect at that time. The statute took
effect, and in a case just decided in June of this year,
People v. Harris, the Michigan Supreme Court relied on
Bulger and said this statute is constitutional. It does
not violate any rights.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So going through the State
system, there's no possibility that these lawyers or the
defendants could successfully assert a right to paid
counsel --
MR. CASEY: That is correct.
Was there -- was there a cert
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because that's already
been decided by the Michigan Supreme Court.
MR. CASEY: As -- as a matter of jurisprudence
by the State supreme court, yes. Both State and Federal
constitutional --
JUSTICE SCALIA: There -- there's an appeal from
-- they could request certiorari from the State supreme
court to this Court, I assume.
MR. CASEY: There are, in fact, two cases
pending, the Harris case that I just mentioned. A
petition for certiorari was filed about 2 weeks ago
raising this precise claim. There is another case Halbert
v. Michigan. It's docket --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:
petition in Bulger itself?
MR. CASEY: There was a petition in Bulger.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it was denied.
MR. CASEY: It was denied.
In -- in addition --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there -- there is a cert
petition filed in what case? In the June case?
MR. CASEY: In the -- the case is pending in
this Court as Melody Harris v. Michigan. It was filed
about 2 weeks ago. I have not been able to find out the
docket number.
There was another case, Halbert v. Michigan,
which is a pro se defendant who was denied counsel. His
applications, pro se applications, were denied in the
State appellate courts. A pro se petition was filed. I
filed a response to that about a month ago. That's docket
number 03-10198. It's on this Court's conference for
Friday, October 8th.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So your point is that there
are petitions filed here that would enable this Court to
decide whether the Michigan Supreme Court was correct in
holding the statute constitutional.
MR. CASEY: That's correct. There are at least
those two petitions pending that I'm aware of in this
Court now.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you acknowledge there is a
good Federal question there at least?
MR. CASEY: Oh, yes. It's -- it's an important
question.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.
MR. CASEY: We -- we -- in the Bulger case, I
opposed certiorari, saying that yes, it's an important
question, but it was correctly decided. At that time,
there was no conflict. Then when the Sixth Circuit
opinion came up, we filed the petition saying it's an
important question and now there's a conflict between the
State supreme court and the Federal court of appeals.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the position you've
taken in -- in the Halbert case, that the Court should
take the case?
MR. CASEY: What I said in the Halbert case is
that the Court need not grant this petition now because,
although it's an important question, the issue is pending
in -- in this Tesmer, the current case, Kowalski v.
Tesmer. If this Court rules in our favor on standing and
then does not reach the constitutional question, then it
would be appropriate to grant certiorari in either the
Halbert case or the Harris case because the -- the
determination of the constitutionality of this statute is
important to the State of Michigan.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do they have lawyers in those
cases?
MR. CASEY: Now, the Halbert petition is pro se.
The Harris petition has either retained or pro bono
counsel. But the -- the constitutionality of the statute
is -- excuse me -- is directly challenged in both of those
petitions.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if in exercising
prudential judgment on whether to accord prudential
standing, because I guess there's article III standing
here, is it appropriate to take into consideration as one
fact that it's already been argued in this case and it's
now ripe for decision, or should we just totally ignore
that aspect of the case?
MR. CASEY: As a matter of judicial economy,
there is a point to be made that it -- the issue has been
briefed and argued. So perhaps it should be decided.
Just last term in Elk Grove v. Newdow, the Court faced a
similar situation. They disposed of the case on
standing --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but in that case there was
a conflict between the interests of the third party and
the interests of the litigant or a potential client. Here
there's no conflict between the lawyers and the clients.
MR. CASEY: That's true.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, also bearing upon
our prudential judgment, I -- I suppose, would be that in
order to reach the merits, we have to do what you assert
to be an end run around the Younger abstention. And --
MR. CASEY: That's -- that's correct. In my
view, the -- the most logical, most appropriate
disposition would be to say that these attorneys do not
have standing. Therefore, reverse the Sixth Circuit's
judgment.
There are these other vehicles pending now to
reach the constitutional issue.
That's true.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but why isn't the
Younger abstention problem just like the mootness problem
in Craig against Boren? It took one class of litigants
unavailable but then allowed the third party to have
standing. Why -- why aren't -- aren't your opponents here
just like the bartenders in Craig against Boren?
MR. CASEY: Well, in determining prudential
standing, there are several criteria that should be
examined in deciding whether there's an exception to the
general rule where a litigant cannot argue the rights of
third parties. In Craig v. Boren, the statute directly
affected the vendor in that case. It was a statute
against sale of certain alcoholic beverages. And in this
case we don't have that.
Also, in Craig v. Boren, nobody argued
prudential standing considerations until the case reached
the Supreme Court apparently.
But in our case, we have a situation where we
have lawyers who do not have any present clients who are
not directly affected by the statute. They're not
claiming rights --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but they have the same
interest that the bartenders had because they won't make
some -- sell their services and the bartenders wouldn't
sell the booze. I don't see the difference.
MR. CASEY: Well, in -- in Craig v. Boren, the
-- if the bartenders did not comply with the statute,
they'd be subject to criminal penalties. Here, the
attorneys will not be subject to any criminal penalties.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't true -- that
wasn't true in the Pierce v. Society of Sisters case and
it wasn't true in the Singleton case. Both of those cases
recognized third party standing, although the prohibition
was not on the plaintiff who was seeking to raise the
rights of another person.
MR. CASEY: That's -- that's true. The parties
have discussed many cases. Almost all of them have some
argued, all of them have distinguishing factors too.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- isn't the biggest
distinguishing factor the one that you raised in response
to Justice Scalia's question? These -- these lawyers can
represent somebody on a direct appeal, the same way and
raise exactly the same issue that they're trying to raise
on third party standing now. Isn't -- isn't that true?
MR. CASEY: That -- precisely. Just normal
principles of litigation counsel that it is appropriate to
have a real party in interest. The criminal defendants
whose rights are at stake in the statute litigate that
factors similar to the circumstances here, and as we've
case. If you take the step and allow standing for an
attorney, based on speculative claims about future clients
and economic harm to the attorney, as the dissent in the
Sixth Circuit says, that opens up the possibility of
vastly expanding the doctrine of standing beyond what this
Court has ever said.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it correct as a
factual matter that these particular lawyers do have
clients that they could be representing --
MR. CASEY: That is not in --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- on direct appeal?
MR. CASEY: -- that is not in the record. In
their response brief, they said that they currently do
have clients, but in the complaint -- this case was,
again, a facial challenge. It was decided on summary
disposition or it was a motion to dismiss. It was filed
and decided within about a month. And there was no
factual development here.
If they had actual clients, there would be
clearly a closer relationship, but again, those clients
would not be hindered from making the claims themselves.
There is no reason --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- the claim that --
I'm sorry.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it just would seem to me
that the lawyers who are advancing this claim may or may
not be representing individuals who want to make the same
claim, but there -- there must be some lawyers who want to
make these claims who don't have any clients, and the
question is whether they have standing. And are they to
be defeated standing because there are a lot of other
lawyers who might also sue?
MR. CASEY: In our view, as a general
proposition, lawyers should not be given independent
standing to raise claims of their clients. When the
clients can present their own issues themselves, as they
can in this case or in this situation under the statute,
there's no need --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that different from Caplin
& Drysdale where the lawyers didn't raise the interest of
the client and --
MR. CASEY: Again, there was an actual client in
that case and there was significant money at stake. The
lawyers had been paid money from drug forfeiture. They
had been paid $25,000, and they wanted another 107 --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But as far as the actual
client, you moved to dismiss. So that's why there's no --
was no back-development. You moved to dismiss.
Therefore, you have to assume whatever facts --
MR. CASEY: That -- that's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in favor of the opponent
of the motion.
MR. CASEY: That's correct. But my response on
that was to the question of, you know, do they in fact now
have clients. There is no allegation in the complaint and
no proof that they now have clients. They may --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But if -- if you assume -- you
assume the correctness of the allegations, which you --
you have to do at this point, the allegation is that they
would get clients and would be paid but for this bar to
payment. Isn't that correct? So if you take them in
terms of their claim, you've got to assume that they will
have clients and they can bring this -- this issue on
behalf of the client.
MR. CASEY: Correct. That goes to the criteria
of injury in fact and close relationship with the third
party. We still have the criteria that I wanted to
discuss this morning about hindrance to the right -- to
the ability of the third party to litigate for themselves.
Excuse me.
In our view, there is no need to expand the
doctrine of standing to permit lawyers to have independent
standing to make these claims because the clients, who are
directly affected by the statute, can make them
themselves. There are the two pending habeas -- or two
pending petitions for certiorari that we've mentioned.
There is another case, the Bulger case. Mr.
Bulger himself, after he lost in the Michigan courts, he
filed a petition for -- for habeas corpus. And the
district court granted the writ of habeas corpus. We
appealed. That case is now pending in the Sixth Circuit.
So that's another vehicle.
It is also possible that an indigent inmate
himself could bring a section 1983 case. It's simply not
necessary to expand the doctrine of standing to give
lawyers --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could an indigent bring a
1983 case? I thought you said that that would be barred
by Younger.
MR. CASEY: If they had a pending prosecution,
it would be barred by Younger. Once that pending
prosecution is over, they could bring a 1983 action.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could they? Because I
thought this Court had held that -- that you can't bring a
1983 suit if what you're seeking to do is overturn the
conviction.
MR. CASEY: Under Heck v. Humphrey, if the
outcome of the 1983 case would necessarily imply that the
conviction or sentence is invalid, you cannot bring the
1983 case. Here, the allegation is simply that they were
entitled to counsel. That's not the substantive merits of
whether the claim -- whether they are properly convicted
or properly sentenced.
The Sixth Circuit, in a case decided August
31st --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if that -- that --
that's -- you're saying that the defendants themselves
could not sue now under 1983?
MR. CASEY: A -- a defendant who is currently in
the State system on direct appeal is barred by the
abstention doctrine from filing a 1983 action. But after
they go through the State court and lose, in addition to
filing a writ of certiorari with this Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And presumably up to this
Court, if they want to come that far.
MR. CASEY: Oh, certainly. After -- after they
go through the State court, they could file a writ of cert
in this Court, as the two pending petitions have. They
could file a complaint for habeas corpus. They could
bring a facial challenge under 1983.
In a case called Howard v. Whitbeck from the
Sixth Circuit, just decided about a month ago, that was
the very question that was decided. An inmate -- a prison
inmate, challenging another statute, litigated and lost in
the State court, then filed a 1983 action. We argued in a
Federal case under Rooker v. Feldman, he was actually
trying to seek review of the State court judgment. The
district court agreed. But the Sixth Circuit just said
Rooker v. Feldman bars the as-applied challenge, but they
remanded for a trial on the merits of the facial
challenge, which is not barred by Rooker v. Feldman. So
an inmate who has been unsuccessful in the State court,
under Sixth Circuit law in my jurisdiction, can bring a
1983 action.
So there are at least three vehicles that an
inmate can bring --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And do you -- do you agree
that that's right? And you said that that's their theory,
that they could bring a 1983 action.
MR. CASEY: We are not filing a petition for
certiorari from that decision. We are abiding by that
decision. We're going back and we're going to try that
case on the merits of the facial challenge to the statute.
That -- that case is Howard v. Whitbeck, docket number
03-1396.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, what the other side
says is, well, yes, maybe they can bring these suits, but
in all of those suits, they don't have counsel, what they
-- what they --
MR. CASEY: That's true. That -- that gets into
the -- the merits of the constitutional claim. And in our
view, talking about the merits, all that is required in
the Michigan application for leave to appeal process is
that a defendant identify the issues and ask the appellate
court to review it. Unlike Douglas, this is not a review
on the merits. An order denying an application for leave
is not an affirmance. It's not an adjudication of the
merits of any legal issue.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what do we look to in
order to verify what -- what you've just said? Do the
Michigan appellate courts catch mistakes all the time?
And if so, what's the standard that they use?
MR. CASEY: The court rules concerning
applications for leave do not set out specific standards.
What -- what the court of appeals can do on an application
for leave is grant the application, deny it, or issue
peremptory relief.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what are the standards
they use? Where -- where do I look to find out what
standards they use, if I get there?
MR. CASEY: To the best of my knowledge, there
are no published standards in court rule or statute on
that. The court is free to exercise its discretion to --
to deny leave for any reason that it chooses.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an example of
where they grant leave to appeal, and if not -- and it's
not one of the exceptions listed in the statute such as
incorrect --
MR. CASEY: If -- if --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- such as incorrect
sentencing?
MR. CASEY: Well, if -- under the statute, if
the court of appeals grants leave, counsel is
automatically appointed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. What are the instances
in which they grant leave, other than sentencing or some
other statutory --
MR. CASEY: They're -- most often they are
sentencing issues. The statistics we put in our brief, in
footnote 25 of our brief, indicated that out of the -- in
2001, there were 38,000 guilty plea convictions. The
court of appeals that year disposed of 7,600 cases. 14
percent of them were guilty plea appeals. Most of them
were disposed of by order. There were somewhere in the
neighborhood of about 50 decisions -- opinions issued in
guilty plea cases. I have not canvased all of them. I
suspect that the vast majority of them are sentencing
issues.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we -- do we know whether
any of those were cases that didn't fall under the four
categories where you a -- a right to?
MR. CASEY: In every case where there was an
opinion, counsel was appointed. The statute requires it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But one of the problems, I
thought, for the indigent is the rulings -- am I correct
-- in Michigan, that they're not required -- say, there's
an objection. There's no written record that the indigent
could look to, even assuming he could understand it, to --
to determine what issues might be raised on -- on appeal.
MR. CASEY: I believe you're incorrect on that,
Your Honor. The -- what an indigent inmate will -- or
defendant will have available to him to prepare an
application for leave to appeal is a transcript of the
proceedings.
He's entitled to that for free. He will
have whatever written motions and written decisions the
trial judge may have issued. He will have -- in the
transcript, he will have the oral motions and the
decisions of the judge, and then in addition to whatever
pro se materials, as in the Ross v. Moffitt case, the
inmate can muster.
In -- in these cases, there are other pro se
materials available. The district court's opinion in this
case noted that there is a -- a form brief, 38-page brief
that was circulating among inmates on the precise question
of entitlement to counsel, which two of the defendants
used in their State court appeals.
But in determining whether counsel is
constitutionally required under Ross v. Moffitt, this
Court has said you look to two things. Are the merits
decided? What is the nature of the appellate process?
And if the merits are not being decided, as in the
Michigan case, we say that falls within the Ross v.
Moffitt line of cases, unlike the Douglas case. In -- in
addition to the nature of the appellate proceedings, he --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, now, your --
your opponents quote some language from the -- one of the
Michigan court of appeals which suggests that the reason
that an appeal was denied was it had no merit.
MR. CASEY:
of appeals issues when it denies an application for leave
to appeal says, denied for lack of merit on the grounds
presented. But there is published, controlling Michigan
authority, which we cited in our brief, that says that
language does not mean that the court of appeals looked at
the merits of the underlying legal issue. What -- what
the court is looking at is the question of whether to
grant leave or deny leave. If they grant leave, counsel
will be appointed. In a very real sense --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what are they getting
at when they say merit? I mean, I take it you concede
A -- a typical order that the court
there was a quotation from that Contineri case on -- cited
on page 30 of their brief. I mean, what -- what is the
reference to merit supposed to mean?
MR. CASEY: I -- I do not know why the court of
appeals uses that language. What I do know is that the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the reasonable thing to
assume that they use it as we would normally expect it
to --
MR. CASEY: Well, the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- to mean by the words they
use?
MR. CASEY: On its face, that would be the first
impression that is given from those words. However, the
published opinions of the court of appeals we've cited in
our brief reject that, and they say that in an application
for leave to appeal, the court of appeals is not
adjudicating the merits.
My opposing counsel in this case was counsel of
record in the Bulger case in the Michigan Supreme Court.
He made exactly that same argument. He persuaded the
dissent in that opinion, but he did not persuade the
majority. They didn't decide the issue precisely, but he
has been arguing that ever since.
But the -- all the precedent that Michigan has
on that point we've cited in our brief. Those are not
decisions on the merits.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it true that Michigan is
the only State in the Union so far that denies counsel on
a first appeal, whether discretionary or mandatory?
MR. CASEY: I believe that is incorrect. The
plaintiffs have cited a 1987 habeas corpus case that
purports to make a national survey. In the Michigan v.
Bulger Michigan Supreme Court opinion in footnote 3, they
cited a 1992 Arizona study which reached almost an
opposite conclusion. They said there were only seven
States which give unrestricted right of appeal, and there
were 21 States that prohibited appeals --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not -- not the right of
appeal. The right to counsel, whether it's a mandatory
or --
MR. CASEY: It's my understanding that Michigan
may be the only State that has a specific statute
prohibiting it with exceptions like this, but it's also my
understanding that the practice in many other States is
that counsel is routinely denied in appeals from guilty
pleas.
I'd like to reserve my remaining time.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Casey.
Mr. Moran, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
In fact, in the 41 years since this Court's
decision in Douglas, no State, not one, not even a -- a
territorial jurisdiction, except for Michigan, has even
attempted to deny counsel to any indigents appealing any
type of first tier appeal.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Moran, this is a
very important question, whether the Michigan law can
survive. But I think before we can address that, we have
to decide whether there is standing for the lawyers you
represent here today, and that's a much tougher question I
think.
Is it possible that this Court could grant
certiorari in one of the pending petitions and resolve the
underlying issue of constitutionality of Michigan's
unusual law?
MR. MORAN: It is, of course, possible, Justice
O'Connor, that this Court could do that.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And if we were to grant you
standing here, wouldn't we have sort of expanded our
existing holdings on who has standing?
MR. MORAN: Not at all, Justice O'Connor. This
case fits squarely within the two prior lawyer-client
standing cases, the Triplett case in which this Court
unanimously found standing for a -- for a lawyer
representing black lung claimants, and the Caplin &
Drysdale case in which this Court found standing for a
third party assertion by a firm representing a criminal
defendant.
And what those three cases have in common and
what makes them unique is that this can only arise in a
case in which the statute or law being challenged
disentitles the client either through loss of funding or
through, like Michigan's law, a statute -- disentitles the
client to representation. Any other change in the law,
tort reform brought up by my --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
really disentitle the client to representation. It says
counsel won't be appointed for him. But presumably these
lawyers could have offered their services.
MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, that wouldn't be
practical, and that raises a point that Justice Souter
also raised in the argument. It wouldn't be practical for
Mr. Fitzgerald or Mr. Vogler to offer their services pro
bono to some indigent in this position because to do so
would probably -- probably be unethical or malpractice.
First of all, they can't be appointed. What the statute
prohibits is the appointment of counsel like Mr.
Well, it doesn't
Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler. So they -- they cannot form an
attorney-client relationship by operation of law.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the answer that all
they have to do is to say, okay, I will represent him but
I am representing him with a claim for funds? And at the
end of the day, regardless of what the Michigan law says,
I'm going to say to the State of Michigan, through the
court, pay me for what I did. That isn't a waiver and
there's nothing unethical about it.
MR. MORAN: But Justice Souter, that's
impractical and unethical in this case because if Mr.
Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler were to do that, they would have
to represent the indigent on his or her underlying plea
and sentencing issues --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.
MR. MORAN: -- or those would be lost forever --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Absolutely.
MR. MORAN: -- because the time would fly. And
so if they also represented him on the underlying plea and
sentencing issues, then this person would not -- then the
underlying defendant would not be a person with standing
to raise the lack of counsel because in fact they have
counsel.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, which -- which indigent
defendants are the attorney plaintiffs asserting claims on
behalf of here? Is it past defendants?
MR. MORAN: This was -- this was -- for Mr.
Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler, they were challenging both the
prestatutory practice of the three defendant judges.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You're talking about the two
individuals, but they've been dismissed.
MR. MORAN: No. Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler,
Justice O'Connor, are the attorneys. They were -- they --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I'm trying to find out
what indigent criminal defendants are these attorneys
attempting to represent here.
MR. MORAN: They routinely take appointments.
They are on a list of --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:
MR. MORAN: Presently and future defendants.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Past defendants?
MR. MORAN: Past defendants. They -- they --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if it's past defendants
who were convicted and didn't have counsel, how is it
consistent with Heck v. Humphrey that they could be here,
these attorneys?
MR. MORAN: I think I -- I think I misspoke. At
the time the statute was passed, it had not gone into
effect. This challenge was filed in order to prevent the
statute from going into effect, to prevent approximately
Future defendants?
2,000 Michigan indigents a year being denied the right to
counsel.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, are you asserting then
that these attorney respondents are here trying to
represent future defendants?
MR. MORAN: Present and future defendants.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And if it's present
defendants, how is that consistent with Younger? How can
they do that?
MR. MORAN: Well, they're not representing any
named defendants. The -- the problem is that as the
statute goes into effect, they will presumably not receive
any further funding for --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if it's future people,
how is it consistent with Los Angeles v. Lyons? I mean, I
just don't see how these attorney representatives get
here.
MR. MORAN: Well, they're in exactly the same
position as the bartender in -- or the beer vendor in --
in Craig v. Boren. They're representing prospective
clients, prospective patients as in Singleton v. Wulff
again. This Court has over and over again -- in fact, in
Triplett itself, this Court recognized that --
specifically said that in Triplett that it applied to
prospective clients, that the -- and it said that in
Triplett that -- it quoted the three factors. And it said
that -- excuse me. I'm looking at the wrong page. It
said in Triplett that a restriction upon the fees a lawyer
may charge applied to the lawyer's prospective client of a
due process right to obtain legal representation falls
squarely within this principle. And that was the
principle of third party standing that this Court cited --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, in Triplett,
the attorneys themselves were subject to discipline. They
were raising third party rights in order to defend a
proceeding brought against themselves. It seems to me
that's distinguishable.
MR. MORAN: That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And the same thing in the bar
case. The -- the restriction against the sale of -- of
liquor was a restriction imposed upon the person seeking
to raise the third party right. But here, there's no
restriction that applies to these lawyers who are seeking
to raise the third party right.
MR. MORAN: But Justice Scalia, this Court has
never held that such a restriction is a condition
precedent or required in order for a person to assert
third party rights.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's so, but we've never held
what you want us to hold either, that -- that when the law
does not bear upon you personally, you have the right to
raise the claim of a prospective client. We've never held
that either.
MR. MORAN: Well, in -- Singleton is a case in
which there was no direct sanction against the doctors who
provided Medicaid abortions.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just as -- as to
Triplett and Boren, you can't cite those two cases and say
those are controlling and then say, well, we've never held
it.
MR. MORAN: I'm sorry. I didn't follow that
question, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we've said that Triplett
and -- and Boren are -- are distinguishable, and you said,
well, we've never ruled on this point. Well, then
Triplett and Boren aren't controlling.
MR. MORAN: Well, I think you have ruled on this
Court -- point by many times recognizing that even persons
against whom the statute or law would not directly affect
-- for example, all the way back to 1925 with Pierce v.
Society of Sisters, there was no legal prohibition against
the school. The legal prohibition was against the
students not going to public school. So 80 years ago this
Court recognized that. In a situation analogous to this,
the school --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was -- a prohibition was
on the parents and there were no parents as plaintiffs in
that case --
MR. MORAN: That's right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- only the schools.
MR. MORAN: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.
It was the school that was -- was held to have standing to
assert the rights of future and current students, and the
same is true of the Singleton case where, again, there was
no particular restriction against the doctors. It was
simply that they would not get funding.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was a problem,
wasn't there, in Singleton that -- that the part that said
that the doctors could raise the patients' right as
opposed to the doctor's own right to practice or whatever,
that that was only a plurality?
MR. MORAN: That was a plurality portion of the
opinion.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it shouldn't be cited
then. You're citing it for something that the Court
didn't hold.
MR. MORAN: Well, actually we've cited it in our
brief only for the article III proposition which this
Court unanimously agreed that the doctors had article III
standing because there was an economic energy --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- I thought you were
citing it here for the quite different proposition that --
that you can raise third party rights.
MR. MORAN: But ultimately this Court in
Singleton allowed the doctors' claim on behalf of the
patients to proceed. I understand that it was a plurality
opinion on the -- on the jus tertii standing.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I could accept -- I guess
I probably would accept your position if I did not think
there -- there was another equally workable alternative
here. And I didn't understand your answer to my earlier
question in which you said, if I recall correctly, that it
would be unethical for these lawyers to represent a -- a
both of the client and, I suppose, of themselves, but
essentially on behalf of a client, say, there is a right
to State money to pay the lawyer who is representing them.
It would be, as I understood you to say, unethical for the
lawyer to proceed on that basis. And I don't understand
the reason for your answer.
MR. MORAN: I think I might have misunderstood
your question, Justice Souter. The question I understood
was why don't they represent people and raise only the
entitlement to right to counsel. In the Bulger case, for
example, the Michigan Supreme Court --
future client, subject to a claim to be paid and on behalf
JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, no. I'm assuming they --
they represent the client for all purposes and one of the
client's claims is, pay my lawyer. I don't have any
money. Your statute is unconstitutional. Why cannot the
lawyer pursue that claim on behalf of the client and --
and raise exactly the issue that is being raised in
substance here?
MR. MORAN: If that attempt -- if that method
were attempted, Mr. Casey would undoubtedly argue that the
attorney would not be entitled to any funding because the
attorney was never appointed. You can't just go out and
find indigents that you would like to represent. You have
to be formally appointed.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, except that that's a very
formalistic answer. The -- the claim, in effect, would be
I have a right to be appointed whatever your statute says
because -- or my -- the -- the client would say my lawyer
-- I have a right to appointed counsel, whatever your
statute says, with the consequence of payment. So to say,
well, they're not appointed, that's the question. Should
they be appointed? I don't see why they cannot raise that
issue.
MR. MORAN: The problem is is that the way the
Michigan system works, it works on a strict rotation
system, and so there's no -- there's no line-jumping here.
There's no right for a -- a client to -- to request a
certain attorney, for a certain attorney to go the head of
the queue and say I would like to represent that fellow
and be --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but these -- these
lawyers are in the rotation. Are you suggesting that the
rotation is so enormous that it will be 20 years before
they get another client?
MR. MORAN: No, not at all. They --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. MORAN: They routinely --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, your -- your claim is
that they are going to get clients in the future and they
-- they ought to have a right to be paid when the time
comes. So why doesn't, number one, a lawyer representing
the next client, whoever he may be, have a right to raise
this, and why doesn't each one of these lawyers have a
right to raise it presumably within a reasonable time when
they next come up in the rotation?
MR. MORAN: I think it's clear that the Michigan
courts would unquestionably hold that a lawyer who simply
inserts himself into a relationship without formal court
appointment is not entitled to be paid.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure they would, and that's
what will get brought to this Court. That's what we're
here for.
MR. MORAN: But the problem is, Justice Souter,
we would then have an issue of Michigan law inserted as to
whether --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, because the claim is that
they have a right under Federal law to an effective
procedure whereby paid counsel can be supplied to them.
That's a Federal issue, not a State issue.
MR. MORAN: That part is a Federal issue, but
what Michigan --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's all you've got to get up
here.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's at least an argument.
JUSTICE SOUTER: It's an argument.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And even if they lose on it,
they still will have -- would have raised the issue that
you are most concerned about getting raised. They're not
-- they're not so much interested in the so many dollars
for this particular representation. Even if they lose on
what seems to me at least a close argument, they will have
raised the question you're trying to raise today.
MR. MORAN: And they will have to do so without
any prospect of being paid, and that's -- that's the
problem.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Who's paying them for this
lawsuit?
MR. MORAN: They're not being paid for this
lawsuit.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. Exactly the same
situation. They can -- they can bring the case directly
for the client they're representing just as readily as
they can bring this one. And if that is true, why is
there an impediment to raising the issue unless we
recognize third party standing?
MR. MORAN: Because Justice Souter, they would
have to represent them on all of their issues. They would
have to represent them on their plea and sentencing issues
without being paid. And that's not what they're doing in
this --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Without being paid if they
lose --
MR. MORAN: -- in this litigation.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- being paid if they win. In
this case, if they win, they don't get a dime because
they're not representing a client. All they get is a
declaration.
MR. MORAN: And --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And they'd be better off to
represent a real client.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. They have a shot
at getting paid using this other method.
MR. MORAN: In -- in this lawsuit, if we win on
the merits, they will then get far more appointments on
the rotation system and then they will get paid for those
appointments.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why will they get more
appointments?
MR. MORAN: Because --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought you said there's a
strict rotation system. When your name comes up, you get
an appointment. How is that going to change regardless of
how this comes out?
MR. MORAN: Because the statute, which is now in
effect -- and this goes, by the way, back to the issue of
prudential standing --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, you're just saying there --
there's going to be a further class of clients to be
represented on the rotation.
MR. MORAN: Correct. Far more.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but that's -- that's
true.
MR. MORAN: And -- and while this Court
considers these issues of prudential standing, thousands
of Michigan defendants will be denied the right to
counsel --
JUSTICE BREYER: And while this suit is being
brought, we can't do the simple thing, which is to take a
case from an indigent who's raising it that we happen to
have on our docket and face it directly because everybody
is tied up in these knots on standing. I mean, what --
what is it that -- that you -- led you to bring this case
rather than just filing an amicus brief in a case brought
by a real indigent who wants a lawyer?
MR. MORAN: Because there -- there was no person
in position at the time. The problem was we had to file
this litigation before the statute went into effect
because once the statute went into effect, thousands of
Michigan indigents would be denied the right to counsel
every year and would suffer probably irreparable damage to
their right to appeal --
JUSTICE BREYER: I see -- I see that. That's a
good answer.
And the -- the question I have is if I now,
since we have real indigents, believe that there
absolutely is a way for a real indigent to raise this
claim that isn't even hard, you could file an amicus
brief. Suppose I believed that, and I do believe it
actually. If I believe it, then does your third party
standing claim disappear?
MR. MORAN: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if it doesn't
disappear and I hold in your favor, would I then be
opening the door to any lawyer whose pocketbook is hurt by
tort reform, by any change at all, you know, that means
less money for him, and we'd be besieged with people?
Instead of the clients, we'd have all the lawyers in
complaining that they want to be richer. Now, that's
what's worrying me. So on my assumption, how could I
possibly decide in your favor without opening that door?
MR. MORAN: Your --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the question I'd like
answered.
MR. MORAN: Your Honor, the only kind of case to
which this applies is a case exactly like Triplett, a case
exactly like Caplin & Drysdale where the claim is that the
underlying change in the law or the underlying law
disenfranchises or disentitles the indigent or the
criminal defendant or the defendant to representation.
JUSTICE BREYER: Because?
MR. MORAN: Because, first of all, if the
indigent or the client still has representation, then
there is no hindrance to the third party raising it
themselves.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? Why would a
change in substantive law --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I assumed there's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- have the same result?
Suppose there's a change in -- in the antitrust law and --
and the person says this change -- this change has the --
the effect of -- of denying me equal protection of the
law. That's the claim that the -- that the client would
have. But there's a lawyer who says, my goodness, this
change will mean there are many -- many fewer antitrust
suits. I can demonstrate that. That's my specialty,
antitrust law. I'm going to lose a lot of business. Why
wouldn't he have the right to raise the equal protection
claim of the prospective client?
MR. MORAN: Because the client could raise it
directly, represented by the attorney. And so the third
prong in jus tertii standing would be clearly missing in
that case.
JUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm sorry. I -- I --
Justice Scalia and I were assuming the same thing. If I
assume that there's no problem with the real person, the
indigent, raising the claim himself -- and I'm saying on
that assumption, which I believe, then if I were to decide
in your favor, how would I not be opening the door that I
wanted to keep firmly closed?
MR. MORAN: But this Court's precedents
indicate, Justice Breyer, that the indigents do have a
significant hindrance to filing their claims themselves.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, okay. No. I agree with
you. If in fact you think that there's a problem about a
real indigent bringing a claim in Michigan, although we
have two on the docket, if I accepted that premise, I
would begin to think you were right. So then what I was
trying to explore is whether the whole thing comes down to
whether I accept that premise. And of course, that's
what's everybody has been talking about, and I do see at
the moment a couple of very good ways that indigents can
bring it themselves, and indeed they have.
MR. MORAN: But I think --
JUSTICE BREYER: But everything comes down to
that. Right?
MR. MORAN: I think an answer I need to give to
-- to cut through all of this is that third party standing
is never predicated on the impossible. Third party
standing is never predicated on the idea that third party
standing is appropriate only if it is impossible for some
indigent to make it into court or some third party or the
person whose rights are being violated to make it into
court. All that must be shown from this Court's
precedents is a hindrance. So this Court did not require
in Craig v. Boren that it was impossible that some young
man could get his claim in front of the court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was altogether possible
there had been a young man. The problem was he turned 21.
So the case would -- from his point of view was moot.
MR. MORAN: Right, but this Court never
suggested that it was -- showing that it was impossible
for someone to quickly get his claim before the court
was --
JUSTICE BREYER: I think I agree with you on
that. I'm just -- the reason I think it's so easy is
because we get indigents. We get thousands of them. And
all you have to have is some indigent saying, hey, I want
a lawyer. Okay? That's all. He has to be able to write
those words. And at that point, you and the others come
in with amicus briefs, if necessary, and support him.
MR. MORAN: Well, the problem is is that in the
meantime thousands of Michigan indigents are going to be
denied counsel.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a practical
question about what is currently before the Court? Mr.
Casey I think told us that the Halbert case is on for the
October 8th conference. If we should grant cert in either
of those direct from the Michigan Supreme Court --
Michigan Supreme Court following Bulger, so you always
leave before then. If we should grant in either of those
cases, wouldn't the wise thing be to simply hold this case
till those are decided?
MR. MORAN: That may well be a wise course of
action -- action, Justice Ginsburg.
I should point out that Mr. Casey, when he filed
the response to the Bulger cert petition, brought this
Court's attention to the fact that this underlying
litigation was proceeding in a case that was then called
Tesmer v. Granholm. And so he brought to this Court's
attention that we had already prevailed in Federal
district court in Tesmer v. Granholm as a suggestion as to
why this Court did not need to grant cert in the Bulger
case, and so this Court did not grant cert. I don't know,
of course -- I don't know why this Court did not grant
cert in Bulger.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he said now he's not
taking that position in the Halbert case.
MR. MORAN: But I can be confident that if there
are any procedural hurdles to this Court's exercise of
jurisdiction in any of the State cases, Mr. Casey will
alert this Court of them. And there may well be. For
example, in the Melody Harris case, the Michigan Supreme
Court remanded for further -- remanded for her to then
file an application for leave to appeal on her underlying
plea and sentencing issues without the assistance of
counsel. Was the Michigan Supreme Court's order a final
order? I don't know. This Court would obviously have to
resolve that. But I can be confident that Mr. Casey will
certainly bring up any procedural hurdles.
And of course, this Court cannot exercise
jurisdiction it does not have in a case just because it
would be more convenient to do so. This Court does have
jurisdiction in this case.
The petitioners never challenged prudential
standing at any point in this litigation -- they -- they
challenged only article III standing, injury in fact --
until this Court. And so part of the reason we don't have
a better record is because this came on a motion to
dismiss. This Court recognized in Lujan that a motion to
dismiss is different than a summary judgment, requires a
-- a different procedural posture. It requires the
assumption of facts being true.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but no facts -- no
additional facts would -- would affect the central point
that -- that we've been devoting most of this discussion
to, which is whether there is an impediment or not to --
to the -- the actual individuals whose rights your clients
are asserting raising their own rights. No additional
facts bear upon that it seems to me.
MR. MORAN: I agree with you on that, Justice
Scalia.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Then what case holds that
there must be an impediment for the third party? I keep
coming back to Craig against Boren. They could have filed
another class action and say that they filed a class
action and had standing. Would we have suddenly decided
we won't decide the merits even though it's been argued
and both sides have had their day in court?
MR. MORAN: I agree with you, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What is the source of the
requirement there must be an impediment to the third party
suit?
MR. MORAN: Well, this Court has said so many
times, and Powers v. Ohio, for example, noted the
impediment to the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: That -- where they granted
standing.
MR. MORAN: That's right.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Have they ever denied
standing on the ground that there was no impediment to the
third party suit? I don't think we have.
MR. MORAN: I don't believe in all of the cases
that both parties cited that there are any cases in which
this Court has said that there was no impediment to the
third party. It is -- it is certainly not the standard --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, do you think
that was just idle observation then?
MR. MORAN: Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice. I
didn't mean to be light about that.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't have to be idle to
be dicta, though, does it?
MR. MORAN: There -- we -- we fully concede
there need to be an impediment, but what it does not
require is the showing that it is impossible for someone
to get here. What is a showing is that for most -- for
the average person in the class, just like the average
grand juror in Campbell v. Louisiana, or the average
venire person in Powers v. Ohio, there are impediments to
getting here.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you fully concede there
must be an impediment even though the Court has never so
held?
MR. MORAN: I'm willing to concede that because
it is so clear to me that there is, that there is an
impediment that trying to get into Federal court, trying
to get here, for that matter, trying to get into Federal
district court -- for an indigent, a typical person who is
very likely -- someone like Mr. Carter, functionally
illiterate, poorly educated, completely unaware of his
rights, to try and navigate the -- the procedural hurdles
of the Michigan system to get all the way through the
Michigan system and then into Federal court, that is a
daunting hurdle. And that's Evitts v. Lucey. This Court
has recognized time and time again in -- in plea cases,
Roe v. -- Roe v. Flores-Ortega. This Court has recognized
time and time again in Peguero that even in a plea case a
typical indigent is completely incapable of getting his or
her case held -- heard, especially if you have to go
through multiple layers of appeal without a counsel for
the first tier. And that is the problem here.
On the merits, I certainly would like to correct
Mr. Casey's representations about the -- the nature of the
Michigan system. The -- a properly filed application for
leave to appeal is invariably denied for lack of merit in
the grounds presented.
look at each and every one of the cases that Mr. Casey has
cited for the proposition that that is not a determination
on the merits because not one of them says that. Not one
of them specifically says that a order denying leave for
lack of merit on the grounds presented is not a decision
on the merits.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could -- could you give me an
example, just from your experience in practice, where
there's an important issue raised after a guilty plea that
requires an appeal where it's not one of the statutory
exceptions?
I certainly urge this Court to
MR. MORAN: Many, many.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Most -- what are -- what are
those cases?
MR. MORAN: Improper denial of jail credit,
making -- improper denial of jail credit.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not sentencing?
MR. MORAN: That is a sentencing error.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay, but that's covered by
the statute.
MR. MORAN: No, it's not. The statute -- the
only exceptions in the statute are for guidelines
departures --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.
MR. MORAN:
indigent gets the appeal granted, but that's putting --
that's after the indigent has had to file an application
identifying his or her own issues without any assistance
of counsel.
Double jeopardy issues. Double jeopardy issues
arise in Michigan all the time; whether sentences should
be consecutive or concurrent; whether there's been a
breach of the plea bargain. All of these issues arise in
Michigan courts every day, and while we are --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there instances where
Michigan has denied the right to appeal when those claims
-- and for -- and then if the
are raised?
MR. MORAN: The problem, Your Honor, is that an
indigent can't raise -- a typical indigent would be
completely incapable of identifying this -- these sorts of
issues.
JUSTICE SCALIA: His counsel will have raised
them. And -- and most, if not all, of those have to have
been raised by counsel.
MR. MORAN: Your Honor, Michigan requires that
ineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on
direct appeal. So if counsel has not raised the issue,
then the indigent would have to recognize that by -- by
himself, and then raise that issue, the ineffective
assistance of counsel, on direct appeal.
Further, even if counsel has recognized it, what
we typically would have would be an oral objection at a
sentencing hearing. For example, Your Honor, I think
these sentences should be concurrent, and the judge says,
no, I'm going to make them consecutive. That's an oral
objection. The indigent will have to be able to get the
transcripts, get the register of actions, get all the
necessary documents, realize that that's a winning issue,
that it does not put him at additional risk. That's
another factor. One of the -- one of the points that a
counsel can help with is tell an indigent, you don't want
to take this appeal because success may result in
revocation of the plea bargain and an additional risk --
will have to realize that this is in my best interest to
go ahead with this appeal. This is my issue. Find the
cases, find the controlling authority.
And even issues as complex as a Blakely issue,
which this Court, of course, will be dealing with this
afternoon, that is an open issue of Michigan law right
now. Is -- are the Michigan sentencing guidelines
unconstitutional or at least the application of them as a
result of this Court's decision in Blakely? Right now, as
a result of the order in Melody Harris, a typical Michigan
indigent will have to raise that complex issue of Sixth
an impossible burden, or the issue will be lost forever.
And that is -- that is a burden that no indigent can meet.
And so I would hope that this Court would not
get hung up on the standing issue because this issue is so
important right now, as a result of the Michigan Supreme
Court's order. Right now these issues are happening and
right now Michigan indigents are being denied the
assistance of counsel. Unique in the Nation. And so this
case has been adversely argued. That's the point of
prudential standing. The petitioners waived the
prudential standing issues below. They challenged only
Amendment law by herself or by himself, and that's simply
article III standing. And so there is every reason for
this Court not to wait for a perfect case that may never
come.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you familiar with the
Halbert case? You mentioned that there might be a
finality problem in Harris.
MR. MORAN: I'm not familiar with that case,
Your Honor. I just became aware of it by letter a few
days ago and I have not had a chance to find out anything
more about it. I have not seen the cert petition in that
case. I'm not aware of the underlying -- excuse me -- the
underlying order from the Michigan courts in that case.
But there may never be a perfect case, but this
requirements for prudential standing. Article III
standing is clearly met in this case, and I hope this
Court will affirm the decision of the Sixth Circuit.
If this Court has no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Moran.
Mr. Casey, you have 3 minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you waive the objection to
prudential standing --
MR. CASEY: We did not waive any of the standing
case is adverse and that meets all the -- all the
claims in this case. We've discussed that in our reply
brief. I've cited pages of the briefs where these issues
were discussed. And the overriding fact is that the
district court, the three-judge panel in the court of
appeals, and the en banc Sixth Circuit all decided these
issues. They have been properly raised and preserved and
they're before the Court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you file a brief in
opposition in Halbert?
MR. CASEY: Yes, I did. I filed that about a
month ago.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And does that have any
procedural impediments?
MR. CASEY: Not to my knowledge. That
individual was convicted in pleas, asked for counsel
citing the Federal litigation in this Kowalski v. Tesmer
case. It was denied. He filed a pro se application for
leave to appeal challenging the denial of counsel and
raising his sentencing issues --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what was the basis for
your opposition to cert?
MR. CASEY: That the Court need not grant cert
in that case because the issue is pending in this case.
If -- if this case goes away, then I suspect we will agree
that that would be an appropriate vehicle to decide the
constitutional issue. As long as this case is pending in
which the issue is raised, I suggested that the Court need
not grant cert in that case to decide the issue. If the
issue is not going to be decided in this case, then that
would be an appropriate vehicle to raise and decide the
issue.
On the standing point, if the plaintiffs here
are given standing, it would be a significant expansion of
this Court's standing doctrine. This Court has never
found third party standing when a litigant is not directly
affected by a statute and there is no close existing
relationship with the third party and there is no
hindrance. We've discussed many cases in which some of
these factors are present and others are distinguishing
factors. This -- this case is, in some respects, unlike
all of them. There would be a significant expansion of
the doctrine.
On the merits of the issue, a constitutional
right to appointed counsel, under the Michigan system,
please read the cases I've cited in my brief, particularly
the Bobenal decision, which I've cited in my principal
brief. In a footnote in my brief, I quote the orders that
the court of appeals was considering. They have the same
language that is at issue here. Controlling Michigan
precedent says that applications for leave to appeal are
not decisions on the merits. All an inmate has to do is
If the Court has no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Casey.
The case is submitted.
