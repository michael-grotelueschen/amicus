CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
next in Case 08-214, Atlantic Sounding v. Townsend.
Mr. McCreadie.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McCREADIE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
Mr. Townsend is a Jones Act seaman who seeks
punitive damages for the willful failure to pay
maintenance and cure.
Like the unseaworthiness claim in Miles, Mr.
Townsend's maintenance and cure claim is a general
maritime law cause of action. Mr. Townsend cannot
recover punitive damages under his general maritime law
cause of action because those damages are unavailable
under the Jones Act FELA, and to a lesser extent DOHSA.
This Court's decision in Miles requires
uniformity between the damages that a seaman can recover
under general maritime law and the damages that a seaman
can recover under the guiding statutes.
Those guiding statutes again are the Jones
Act, the FELA, and the DOHSA.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McCreadie, in this
case, why is it necessary to get into that, whether they
are punitive damages under FELA and the Jones Act? If
we accept, as I think we must, Townsend's allegations to
be true, he has said that Atlantic, as a matter of
routine, puts in a boilerplate complaint for declaratory
relief, reciting all the reasons why somebody could not
get maintenance and cure, even though that is patently
false, the allegation for example that he deserted his
post. He says it's false. He said the allegation that
he falsified his application for employment is false.
Accepting the -- that to be true at this
stage, isn't there some kind of punitive measure to be
taken against a litigant who abuses the court process in
that way?
MR. McCREADIE: First, Justice Ginsburg,
those are just allegations. There's no evidence --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but -- but now we're
at the pretrial stage, and we're supposed to assume the
truth of the allegations in Townsend's complaint. We're
assuming -- they may well turn out to be false; but at
the threshold under 12(b)6 we accept those allegations
as true and then determine whether a claim is stated.
MR. McCREADIE: Well, if -- if those
allegations are true, there's no distinction between the
willful wanton misconduct that traditionally has been
the subject of the dispute about maintenance and cure
and punitive damages as opposed to those allegations.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But let's take this out
of the maintenance and cure spot altogether. Litigation
generally, if a court determines that a litigant is
abusing the court's process by filing false pleadings,
is there a remedy; and if so, what is it?
MR. McCREADIE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there
is a remedy. And that's what Vaughan v. Atkinson
provides. In that case this Court looked at abuse of
the litigation process and determined that the plaintiff
in that case was entitled to attorneys' fees.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that all that
was at stake there was whether the employer wrongfully
withheld maintenance and cure that was owing. The
allegations made by Townsend go far beyond that they
just unreasonably denied him maintenance and cure. They
suggest that this litigant, as a matter practice,
standard operating procedure, makes false claims before
a court. And my question to you is, isn't across the
board there a sanction, wholly apart from the particular
claim, for a litigant who abuses the court's processes?
MR. McCREADIE: I think there's a -- there's
a number of potential sanctions. I mean, there is Rule
. There's the natural discretion of the court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is any of them called
punitive damages? Do you know of any case in which a
court has --
MR. McCREADIE: No, I do not.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And punitive damages, of
course, requires that you first find the guilty person
to lose the case. So what if a person makes these
terrible allegations, but ends up winning the case
anyway, and -- and -- well, you couldn't impose punitive
damages.
MR. McCREADIE: I agree with --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We've got to call it
something else, don't we?
MR. McCREADIE: I agree with your position
there. And what I was trying to answer the question is
if someone does abuse the litigation process, that is
what Vaughan v. Atkinson addressed. And it -- it
awarded attorneys' fees, which -- which are unusual. It
is an exception to the American rule. And it is a
deterrent for anyone to try to play fast and loose
with --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you read Vaughan v.
Atkinson as necessarily implying punitive damages would
be inappropriate? I can't quite find the negative that
you want me to find, I think, in Atkinson. True, they
didn't talk about punitive damages. They said damages
are appropriate, and attorneys' fees in this case, which
is what the district court gave, we are going to affirm
it. But there's nothing there that said punitive
damages are inappropriate.
MR. McCREADIE: No. The dissent mentioned
that. But you can not speak for the majority opinion.
But up until Vaughan v. Atkinson, in the history of the
United States there was never a holding where punitive
damages were awarded to a Jones Act seaman for the
failure to pay maintenance and cure.
It was only after Vaughan v. Atkinson, after
the dissent mentioned that concept, that the issue ever
arose in the history of Supreme Court precedent, circuit
precedent, in this country.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Whose dissent was that? I
have forgotten that. Whose dissent was it? Do you
recall? Stewart?
MR. McCREADIE: I do -- I do not believe --
it is coming Justice Harlan, but I just -- I just cannot
say off the top of my head who wrote the dissent.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said never in the
history. I mean, there -- there are examples like the
ancient Nancy case, where the damages, where they were
called exemplary -- but when you say never has there
been before or after punitive awards. But there is
precedent, the Nancy case in this Court, cases in lower
courts, there have been punitive damages awards in -- in
maintenance and cure cases.
MR. McCREADIE: Justice Ginsburg, I made the
distinction between there's no case in the history of
the United States before Vaughan v. Atkinson awarding
punitive damages to a seaman, a Jones Act seaman, for
the failure to pay maintenance and cure.
The case that you refer to, the Amiable
Nancy, and other cases, they apply to general maritime
law with respect to collisions, now with respect to
pollution, and that's a broader context. But if we look
at the history of general maritime law, if we look at,
for example, Calhoun, there's the critical distinction
between non-seafarers and seafarers. If we look at
Latsis, there's the critical distinction between seaman
and longshoremen. In those status, they define the
class of persons that we're looking at to see whether
they can recover punitive damages.
And this case involves a Jones Act seaman.
And because it involves a Jones Act seaman, that's the
class of claimant that we're looking at. And when we
have a Jones Act seaman the primary statute that we look
at is the Jones Act. Of course, the Jones Act
incorporates FELA by reference. And the DOHSA, as Miles
points out, also has an impact on the -- on the case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did this Court ever hold
that under FELA or under the Jones Act there are no
punitive damages? Do we have any holding to that
effect?
MR. McCREADIE: No, there is no specific
holding, and I would point out that if there was, that
would answer our question today and we wouldn't be here.
But that we do have is Miles, which is very
clear and specific about what damages are available to a
seaman; and those damages are compensatory damages.
Miles is clear that the seaman can be compensated for
pecuniary loss, the seaman can be compensated for his
pre-death pain and suffering. Because punitive damages
are not compensatory damages, because punitive damages
do not compensate for pecuniary loss, and because
punitive damages do not compensate for pre-death pain
and suffering, they are not available to a Jones Act
seaman.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that -- but that was a
common law wrongful death action, correct, Miles?
MR. McCREADIE: Miles was --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It was not admiralty
maintenance and cure.
MR. McCREADIE: Justice Kennedy, Miles was a
wrongful death action. But when we look at Miles and we
question, well, that is a wrongful death action, it is
very clear, should Miles apply in a personal injury
action, then we need to -- we -- first we know -- we
look at the cases that have addressed that point.
And first off, Miles does not say that the
uniformity principle applies only to wrongful death
actions.
Secondly, Cortes, Supreme Court precedent,
tells us that the rules are the same for personal injury
and death actions for maintenance and cure under the
Jones Act.
In Cortes, the opposite argument was made:
That the maintenance and cure claim could proceed for
personal injury but not for a death action. Here, the
Respondent is making the argument --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, that the
maintenance and cure claim could proceed or that the
punitive damages claim could be made?
MR. McCREADIE: You're absolutely correct.
Here they are making the argument that the punitive
damages claim could -- can proceed under the personal
injury side of the case but not the death side. And
Cortes has already addressed that issue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McCreadie, there's a
question about this case, a troublesome feature of it.
That is, you are saying because there are no
punitive damages available under FELA and under the
Jones Act, then there certainly should not be any under
maintenance and cure. But if we have to answer those
questions, whether there are punitive damages available
under FELA and the Jones Act, in the context of a
maintenance and cure claim, then we're deciding a much
larger question than are punitive damages available for
willful refusal to pay maintenance and cure. We're
deciding a question under the Jones Act, a question
under the FELA, and there are a lot of people who would
be interested -- and the seamen are a sizable group that
the law cares about particularly. But there would be a
larger interest, a larger interest in the answer in the
Jones Act context and FELA. And to decide those
questions in a case that doesn't present any claim under
FELA or any claim under the Jones Act is troublesome.
MR. McCREADIE: I certainly agree with you,
Justice Ginsburg, that the answer to this case answers
the question of what damages are available under the
Jones Act and -- and FELA.
But, again, if you look at Miles, which
analyzing both FELA cases, Vreeland for example, and
Kraft, which is a railroad case, it -- it has already
specifically stated what compensatory -- that
compensatory damages alone are available under the death
side, admittedly, and that the compensation for a seaman
and, therefore, for a FELA employee is limited to
compensation for pecuniary loss and for pre-death pain
and suffering.
Also, if we look at another string of
Supreme Court precedent, it's not as clear as Miles, but
if we look at the other string, it -- this Court has
stated over and over that compensatory damages are what
is available under the Jones Act; compensatory damages
are available under the FELA; and compensatory damages
are available under DOHSA. For example, Zicherman is a
post-Miles case, and it's written and states the
principles very clearly: The Jones Act provides,
permits, I should say, compensation only for pecuniary
losses. And then it discusses Vreeland, which is a FELA
case, and it says that the FELA permits compensation
only for pecuniary losses.
And so, again, if we look at the history on
the death side, which Miles summarizes, but if we look
on the personal injury side, at the Osceola, the
Iroquois -- Peterson mentions compensatory damages nine
times in expressing what remedies are available to
seamen. And so those railroad cases, those Jones Act
cases, have been decided and have been a part of our
precedent for 60, 70, 80 years.
And, of course, it is important to note that
the Congress has amended the Jones Act in 1982, with no
tampering with this history. It has amended the Jones
Act in 2006 with no tampering with the history, and it
has amended the Jones Act in 2008 without any change.
And that's in light of Guevara, decided in 1995; that's
in light of Roy Al, decided in 1995, and 10 years plus
for the cases to percolate and for Congress to decide
whether they agree with those policy determinations.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: As I read your reply
brief -- and please correct me if it's a
misimpression -- you didn't dispute the fact that
punitive damages were available historically for the
shipowner's wrongful refusal to provide maintenance and
cure, or am I wrong about that?
MR. McCREADIE: I -- that must have been the
Respondent's brief, because our position is -- hopefully
was clearer than that, that punitive damages have never
been awarded in the history of the United States for the
willful failure to pay maintenance and cure until
after -- until after Vaughan v. Atkinson.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what about English
admiralty, under the English precedents?
MR. McCREADIE: The English precedents we
did not analyze. We took Miles when it analyzes Lord
Campbell's Act, and then that was analyzed in Vreeland,
and from that point forward, Miles took that, that line
of cases --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, in Miles --
again, we're coming back -- was wrongful death, not
maintenance and cure.
MR. McCREADIE: Miles was a wrongful death
case that analyzed an unseaworthiness cause of action,
which is brought under general maritime law. We are
looking at maintenance and cure, which is a claim
brought under general maritime law. Both existed before
the Jones Act, unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure,
and again both are general maritime law claims.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, your
friend on the other side distinguishes that argument by
noting that death is different. As he puts it, we're
all going to die, so --
MR. McCREADIE: In that case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you have
different considerations under the maintenance and cure.
MR. McCREADIE: Mr. Chief Justice, that take
us back again to Cortes, which this Court has already
decided and analyzed. Should we distinguish between a
death action, maintenance and cure action under the
Jones Act, from a personal injury action? And the
unequivocal answer from this Court is no, that you
should not treat them differently. There's no logic for
treating them differently. We also need to remember
that one of the anomalies that was -- that was cured by
Moragne -- the first anomaly cured by Moragne was an
anomaly where the unseaworthiness action would exist in
State territorial waters but not in -- I'm sorry, it
would exist in State territorial waters, but not on the
high seas. And that troubled the Moragne Court, that
you would have a discrepancy between personal injury and
death, and that's one of issues that they tried to --
tried to reconcile.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was -- it
was on the high seas. They had DOHSA. At the time of
Moragne, there was DOHSA, but then it was when you
weren't on the high seas that was the gap. Wasn't that
the case?
MR. McCREADIE: That's correct. My point is
there was a difference of what right you had under -- in
territorial waters under unseaworthiness that Moragne
described as one of the anomalies. And the anomaly was
that if the person was injured, they could get an
unseaworthiness claim; if they died, they could not.
And Moragne was clear that distinguishing between death
and personal injury, it made no sense.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's what the
common law was. That's why we had Lord Campbell's Act.
That was if you die, too bad; if you're injured, you
collect.
That was fixed by statute on the high seas,
DOHSA. Because there was the gap, there was no Lord
Campbell's Act, the Court effectively made one up,
right? That's what it did in Moragne.
MR. McCREADIE: Moragne did create some law,
yes. Let me try to answer the question in a different
way --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I just -- and you can
go ahead and answer that question without my
interrupting. But my assumption from reading the amicus
briefs in this case is that punitive damages were
awarded in some maintenance and cure cases (a) as simply
part of the overall award -- they weren't separated out,
but it was part of the measure -- and (b) that some
American courts, American judges, including noted
admiralty judges, awarded in some cases punitive damages
in maintenance and cure before the modern cases Moragne
and so forth -- and Miles -- that you're talking about.
Is that incorrect?
MR. McCREADIE: That is incorrect. If you
read the cases cited, and they have their roots in some
law review articles that are critical of Miles, that
don't like the Miles decision, but if you read those
cases --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking pre-Miles.
I'm talking pre-Miles.
MR. McCREADIE: And I'm saying the cases
that are cited in those law review articles -- the
purpose of the articles is to criticize Miles. Those
cases do not stand for the proposition that they're
presented for in the law review article and they do not
stand for the propositions that they have been presented
to this Court. They are not holding -- they are not
giving an award of punitive damages for maintenance and
cure in any of those cases.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is -- how many -- how many
would you say there are in a typical year, maintenance
and cure cases? About, roughly? I mean, say in the
late twentieth century, 18 -- 1980, 1990. Have you have
any guess at all?
MR. McCREADIE: Justice Breyer, because
maintenance and cure is so often linked to the Jones Act
and the unseaworthy cause of action, and because of the
leverage that seems to be brought with punitive damages,
they are virtually included in every seaman's case --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right.
MR. McCREADIE: -- from the get-go.
JUSTICE BREYER: So how many would you
guess?
MR. McCREADIE: And -- and I would have to
estimate, just extrapolating from my own experience,
thousands of Jones Act cases are filed in the country
every year.
JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. And they usually
have maintenance and cure aspects.
MR. McCREADIE: Necessarily they do.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can you get punitives under
the Jones Act or not?
MR. McCREADIE: You cannot recover punitive
damages under the --
JUSTICE BREYER: What about unseaworthiness?
MR. McCREADIE: You cannot recover punitive
damages under unseaworthiness because that's the same
rule that Miles already decided. Miles decided in
unseaworthiness --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so if I have about 30
cases -- no, I had, actually, to be honest, I thought we
found about 12 in the period around 1980 - 2000 where
they do give some punitive damages.
MR. McCREADIE: And -- and -- and I hope I
was clear that the can of worms was opened by Vaughn.
No one awarded it. No one thought about it, until after
Vaughn.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then I found
about 10 cases in the period before the Jones Act where
there was something given -- punitive damages being
given for something, and there was something sort of
like maintenance and cure in there.
MR. McCREADIE: There -- there are some
pre-Jones Act cases, like the Amiable Nancy, that --
that talk about punitive damages; and there are some
cases where some seamen have not been treated very well.
But a specific look at the cases reveals that there is
no pre-Jones Act case awarding punitive damages --
JUSTICE BREYER: Over here, there is one
called -- Unica v U.S. The master should have put the
-- into the hospital. Given him $1,500. It was partly
punitive. Considering -- De Troupe -- I mean, I found
some that are sort of -- sort of -- I don't know what to
say. I don't know who to make of it.
MR. McCREADIE: The Troupe is on the list.
It is a case that we have looked at, and it is -- and
again, it is a case that I can say that if you look at
all of them -- it is a very tedious process; there are a
lot of cases, and wading through each one, none of them
hold or award punitive damages for the failure to pay
maintenance and cure. And --
JUSTICE BREYER: The Troop gave them $4,000.
Considering all the circumstances of the aggravation.
Gross neglect, mistreatment. "It is useless to parade
more of the sickening details."
MR. McCREADIE: And our position is that
even if there is -- and there is not; let me be clear --
but even if there was one rogue case, one individual
case, that does not create general maritime law.
Something more is needed. For example, a decision from
this Court would create general maritime law.
The Wilburn Boat case is an insurance case.
There's an example where there are some cases on the
subject of marine insurance, but there's not enough for
the court to conclude that there is a general maritime
law on that subject.
And so returning again to this -- this
pocket of cases, they do not stand for the
proposition -- even if they did, if you'll notice, two
of them, it's the same district court judge who is
making the noise that he would have done this or he
might have done this. And -- and our position is that
one district court judge does not create general
maritime law by mentioning the possibility of punitive
damages in one case.
We're much more comfortable relying on this
Court's precedents, the line of cases that builds from
Moragne to Higgingbotham and culminates in Miles, we're
much more comfortable looking at the history of the
damages awarded by this Court to seamen, where it uses
the term compensatory damages -- compensation for --
over and over and over without any mention whatsoever of
punitive damages.
The punitive damages problem did not crop up
until Vaughn, even though now everyone seems to agree
Vaughn did not hold that punitive damages were
available.
I would also just like to mention all the
circuit court cases addressing this issue hold that
Jones Act precludes punitive damages, and any circuit
court that has addressed this issue since Miles likewise
specifically holds punitive damages are not available
for the willful failure to pay maintenance and cure.
I'd like to reserve my remaining time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Sullivan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF G.J. ROD SULLIVAN, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it
please the Court:
I would like to start by answering the
question that was raised by Justice Ginsburg. This
Court does not need to reach the question of whether or
not punitive damages are available under the Jones Act
or under the FELA in order to decide this issue, because
maintenance and cure is different. It precedes the
Jones Act by centuries, perhaps even a thousand years,
and it deals with a distinctly different problem.
Maintenance and cure deals with a situation
as what do we do with an injured seaman to get him back
to health and get him into the workforce? And the law
has provided since Catherine of Aragon went to Greece in
the 1200s that the ship owner has a responsibility, in
its capacity as a ship owner, to provide that seaman
with medical care and to provide that seaman with a
living allowance so that he can get better and get back
into the work force.
Now in 1920, Senator Jones intended to make
the United States merchant marine the world's greatest
merchant marine. He was dealing in a factual scenario
where 12 years earlier, on April 12 of 1912, the Titanic
had sunk; 1,900 people had died.
Virtually every member of the Senate and
Congress knew somebody who was on the Titanic, and
during the intervening eight years, certain points of
law became obvious. First of all, the people who died
on the Titanic could not recover for anything other
except their lost baggage. They could not recover for
the fact that their loved ones had passed away because
there was no cause of action.
Secondly, because the Titanic hit an iceberg
and was not unseaworthy, there was no cause of action
for negligence. So Senator Jones set around to correct
these two anomalies in the law, and said what we are
going to do is we're going to create a new class of
beneficiaries, who are dependents of people who die at
sea, and we are going to give them the right to recover
pecuniary damages. That's the only place where
pecuniary damages are mentioned in the law. And then it
said, and as to seamen, we're going to give them an
additional right, a cumulative right on top of
unseaworthiness, and that's going to be negligence.
It never sought out to touch maintenance and
cure. Maintenance and cure has been something that's
been monitored by the courts ever since its inception,
and it is a self-regulating system. Before Guevara,
ship owners regularly provided their employees with
medical care without asking the question. If there was
a close call, they provided the medical care without
running to the court. They provided maintenance.
Then came Guevara, and Guevara decided for
the first there were no punitive damages, and now you
have a growing problem in this country. You have a
problem with ship owners providing less and less medical
care without resort to the courts.
Now our position here is that a seaman
should be not ever have to come before a court to seek
maintenance and cure, and the court should never, ever
have to award punitive damages.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, surely there will be
some incidents in which the employer in good faith
thinks there's no illness, that there's no basis for
maintenance and cure. MR. SULLIVAN: And as --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: For you to tell me oh,
this will just never happen, I mean, that's not the way
the world works.
MR. SULLIVAN: No. And Judge, when a --
when an employer comes to the court in good faith and
says there's no entitlement to maintenance and cure, and
there -- the court finds that -- or the factfinder finds
in good faith, there's no basis for punitive damages.
Then you merely have a dispute. But the situation --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course there are
going to be disputes, and the question is whether or
not, just from the standpoint of filling professional
responsibility, in almost any maintenance and cure
action where the counsel for the plaintiff thinks
that -- for the seaman thinks that the employer has been
remiss, he doesn't add the punitive damages complaint if
we agree with your position, which changes completely
the settlement and the bargaining aspect. But you can
address -- you can address that.
MR. SULLIVAN: Well -- and I agree, Your
Honor, that is a prospect and a possibility, something
which I personally abhor doing. I mean, you should only
plead punitive damages when you have a good faith basis
for doing it; you believe you will survive a directed
verdict. It should not be thrown in to every single
complaint, and I'm not denying that some counsel will do
that.
But what I'm saying is that today, in 2009,
in 2006, there are actually ship owners who are, as a
regular practice, denying their seamen medical care. I
don't know why that is. Perhaps it's because it is
expensive now, more expensive than it has ever been.
Perhaps it is because there are safety nets that will
allow the seamen to seek Medicaid, and so the taxpayer
will pay for it. Whatever the motivations are, it is a
growing trend that we are seeing.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many of these seamen
who seek maintenance and cure are represented? I mean,
what is the incidence of representation for maintenance
and cure claims as distinguished from Jones Act
negligence type claims with the -- the possibility of
large recoveries for pain and suffering?
MR. SULLIVAN: Judge, I'd be picking a
number out of the air, but I can give you anecdotal
evidence of this. In the Fifth Circuit attorneys who
regularly do maritime personal injury work tell each
other -- we talk about the fact that you can't afford to
represent somebody who's got a maintenance and cure case
that's not combined with a Jones Act case. And there
are a number of practical reasons for that.
You have to pay all of the experts, and it
is very expensive to bring these cases. You have to
hire the orthopedic surgeons, the -- the radiologists.
You have to pay for the tests, and then, as an attorney,
these are never recoverable as costs.
And then you are working on a contingent
hourly fee. If you win your case and you prove that
they were willful, wanton, and callous in -- in denying
maintenance and cure, then you might get a portion of
your attorneys' fees back.
Now, you may do that as a pro bono matter on
occasion. But you cannot rely upon the fact that
attorneys will take these cases.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why -- why does
joining it to a Jones Act case help?
MR. SULLIVAN: Well, because when you join
it to a Jones Act case, you have the substantial
possibility of getting either a settlement or a verdict
at the end of the case which is going to compensate the
attorneys for taking on the maintenance and cure case as
a portion of it.
And so, consequently, if somebody has a
serious accident, it falls under the Jones Act and there
is a maintenance and cure count, the attorney will
handle all of those together and feel adequately
compensated.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the point
you are making is that the recovery under the Jones Act
can be very large, and the attorney on a contingent
basis would get a piece of that.
MR. SULLIVAN: Exactly, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because it would be
swelled by the pain and suffering damages which are not
available in maintenance and cure.
MR. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the
pre-Vaughan case that awarded punitive damages --
awarded punitive damages in a maintenance and cure case?
MR. SULLIVAN: Judge, first of all, I would
cite to you two cases: The Rolf case, which is a 1924
Ninth Circuit case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I am -- what --
which --any case from this Court?
MR. SULLIVAN: No. No. This issue did not
come before this Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It hasn't come before
this Court under FELA or the Jones Act, either, the
punitive damage question?
MR. SULLIVAN: It hasn't -- it has not, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Rolf was not a -- Rolf was
maintenance and cure and personal injury and
unseaworthiness. So we don't know which aspect of the
case led to the punitives.
MR. SULLIVAN: We don't, but we know that
there was outrage on behalf of the court. And,
--
unfortunately, in -- and I think, as Justice Souter
pointed out --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is it the case that we
can't find a single pre-Jones Act case where punitives
were awarded and what was sought was maintenance and
cure? I -- I found some, but they seem ambiguous to me.
MR. SULLIVAN: Well, Judge, I would say that
JUSTICE BREYER: What is your best?
MR. SULLIVAN: Yes. I would say that the
best are the Rolf and the Margharita, which were denials
of medical care where the damages were enhanced because
of outrageous conduct. But to say that, Judge, is there
a case that says this is maintenance and cure, we are
going to award punitive damages, that's not been done.
JUSTICE BREYER: So we have a history all
the way back to Catherine of Aragon, and what we've been
able to find in these pre-Jones Act cases is really two
or three, or maybe I found ten actually, that I couldn't
say -- leaning over in your direction, I could take
maybe three or four. And they show a little ambiguity.
But give them all ten, and that's still ten out of
hundreds of years of history.
MR. SULLIVAN: Well, let me -- let me
respond to that in a couple of ways. First of all,
punitive damages were part of the common law until taken
away by Congress.
And -- and it could be asserted that
maintenance and cure punitive damages were not necessary
because the threat was enough to -- to require
shipowners to go ahead and provide this. And I would
point out to the Court that this had not been a problem
prior to Guevara. Shipowners did self-regulate. They
didn't -- seamen didn't run to the courts every time
they wanted maintenance and cure; whereas, today they
have to.
The leading scholar in this whole area is
Professor Robertson at the University of Texas who wrote
the AHA brief. And his brief on pages 7 through 11
catalogs the cases where he suggests punitive damages or
exemplary damages were awarded for outrageous conduct
involving failure to provide medical care.
And I would suggest that those show that
punitive damages were unexceptional before Vaughan.
They were part of the common law. They -- they were
before this Court in the Amiable Nancy even though it
didn't involve medical care. There is no reason to
assume that punitive damages are accepted in maritime
law; as part of the common law, that they weren't also
accepted for the willful, wanton, and egregious failure
to provide a seaman with medical care.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I thought that the lack
of counsel in maintenance and cure cases was a pivotal
point or a relevant point for our decision, other than
the representations of counsel, where would I look to
verify that?
MR. SULLIVAN: The existence of prior
maintenance and cure cases?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- that there
is a problem in seamen finding attorneys who will take
maintenance and cure cases.
MR. SULLIVAN: Yes, Judge. There is not
empirical evidence out there. Nobody has done studies.
I'm not aware of any. But do we really want to wait for
the situation where we have hundreds and hundreds of
seamen who are -- are, you know, living homeless or
living in their cars or unable to obtain medical care
before this Court decides that if somebody does this, it
is something that can be punished?
And -- and I think that's the situation
we're at today. It is a growing problem. And it is a
growing problem because Rivera is a relatively new case,
and it has spread to the other circuits.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if -- if the
-- if the existence of the punitive damages and
maintenance and cure were as well established, why
wasn't that mentioned in terms in the Vaughan majority?
It only comes up in the Vaughan dissent.
MR. SULLIVAN: Well, it does come up in the
Vaughan dissent because it was not requested by the --
in the -- in the lower courts. And this Court would not
consider a claim for punitive damages for the first time
on appeal.
I -- I think what Justice Stewart was saying
is we have a question before us where somebody is
requesting attorneys' fees in -- in derogation of the
American Rule. The majority is saying we are going to
find an exception to the American Rule and give
attorneys' fees. And justice Stewart is saying, I don't
want to do that. I think that the better --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think Stewart knew
more about these -- these obscure, ancient cases than we
MR. SULLIVAN: I'm sorry? Was he more --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think he knew more
about these obscure, ancient cases than we do?
MR. SULLIVAN: No, I -- I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Had he had the benefit of
briefs by Professor Robertson and -- I think not, right?
MR. SULLIVAN: No. No. I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It was just sort of off the
top of his head that he thought there should be punitive
damages.
MR. SULLIVAN: He was quoting from McCormick
on damages amend some basic treatises. And I think he
was taking the position that punitive damages are in our
quiver of weapons that we can use to deter --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they normally are,
but the question is whether there -- whether this --
this is a different quiver.
MR. SULLIVAN: Well, I think that he was
saying that this is one of the weapons we have. Instead
of creating an exception to the American Rule, let's
give them punitive damages to account for this egregious
conduct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- that was not
argued by anybody. It wasn't raised in the lower court.
It wasn't a punitive damages case.
MR. SULLIVAN: No, it wasn't. It wasn't.
The first time counsel for Mr. Vaughan raised the
question of punitive damages was on remand. And then
the district court said, hey, look, you didn't raise it
before. Just because Justice Stewart suggested this as
-- as an alternative to attorneys' fees doesn't mean
we're going to award punitive damages now.
JUSTICE BREYER: With attorneys' fees there
is a compensatory aspect. The -- the basic obligation
is to keep this seaman alive and well, and then you give
him some wages if necessary, and you give him medical
care. And -- and now he's going to be out that
attorneys' fees as a result of his sickness. So I
understand that.
Punitives does not compensate him for
anything. It is a policy matter for the State. He's a
beneficiary of a windfall. And it seems a more radical
step to make something up out of whole cloth here with
punitives than it does with attorneys' fees.
MR. SULLIVAN: Judge, I would like you to
look at how Congress treats this problem. If you had,
for example, a bridge-building project where a seaman, a
longshoreman and a State worker all got injured
identically in the same accident side by side, and the
shipowner failed to provide medical care for the
longshoreman, the shipowner could go to jail. If the
shipowner provided -- or failed to provide medical care
to the State worker, he could be, again, subject to
criminal penalties.
On top of the criminal penalties, Congress
has established these administrative agencies to assure
that those workers get medical care. On top of that, if
they don't get medical care, they lose their defense of
workers' compensation immunity. They lose the defense
of assumption of risk, contributory negligence, and they
are subject to personal liability, not just corporate
liability.
JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe it would be a good
thing.
MR. SULLIVAN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: The -- the problem here is
it has pros and cons. I was quite moved by the brief --
the citation that Professor Robertson made of all of
those old cases until we looked them up. And -- and
then I found they seem to stand for a little bit less
than I had the impression they stood for.
MR. SULLIVAN: That --
JUSTICE BREYER: So we'd be making this up
out of whole cloth, it seems to me.
MR. SULLIVAN: I don't think so, Your Honor.
What I think he would be saying is this is part of our
power as a common law court. And just because.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We've abandoned that.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- because Miles says don't
do that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. We've abandoned
that in this hearing. We said what we do with these
admiralty causes of action we should be guided by what
Congress has done in the Death on the High Seas Act and
the Jones Act.
Do you acknowledge that there are no
punitive damages available in the event of death?
MR. SULLIVAN: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- you want to
talk about what's a sensible system and what is not a
sensible system. In the days when Massachusetts used to
have a -- when I was in law school, they had a
compensation limit for wrongful death, but to limit for
pain and suffering, for negligence; and the line was
back her up again -- back her up again, Sam, she's not
quite dead yet.
(Laughter.)
MR. SULLIVAN: Judge, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is -- is this going
to be the same thing, where -- where the ship owner
says, well, you know, if -- if -- if I treat him badly
enough that he dies, I don't get hit with the punitive
damages?
MR. SULLIVAN: I would hope that would not
be the case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but it is invited,
isn't it?
MR. SULLIVAN: Well, I don't think it is
invited, Judge. There are reasons why that there is
this anomaly that there are no punitive damages for
death. And that's because in 1920 when Congress created
the Death on the high Seas Act there were no -- any kind
of damages. There was no recovery at all.
And so, Congress preempted this field of
death. And it said that death cases shall be decided
under the Death on the High Seas Act. But Congress has
completely stayed away from the area of maintenance and
cure. It hasn't enacted administrative remedies because
the Court has always been the one who has decided what's
appropriate.
And this Court, as a matter of its -- as
maintaining its court docket and maintaining these
remedies, has the right and I think the obligation to
say we're going to keep these cases out of court by
awarding punitive damages when somebody willfully denies
this right, when somebody willfully withholds medical
care.
And I think if you do that, you're going to
see these cases are going to disappear. Seamen are
going to start getting their medical care again. They
are not going to be coming to the court every time they
get injured and saying, I haven't gotten my back
surgery. I haven't gotten my rotator cuff surgery. It
is sort of a matter of court administration to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure as
sure -- I'm not sure I follow that. In other areas
where we allow punitive damages it hasn't resulted in
the cases going away. Quite the opposite. It seems
that it has given rise to a variety of claims on both
sides.
MR. SULLIVAN: This is a very narrow area of
law, Your Honor. We are talking about are you giving
the seaman the medical care he needs to get the maximum
medical improvement? And that's all it is.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but the normal
medical malpractice area has given rise to a lot of
punitive damage litigation. I don't know why this would
anybody different.
MR. SULLIVAN: I think this would be
different because all we're talking about is does the
seaman get the surgery he needs. If he doesn't get the
surgery he needs and he gets worse or continues to stay
ill or he continues to stay in pain, then the ship owner
should be punished. But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It certainly makes these
maintenance and care cases a lot more attractive to the
plaintiffs' bar doesn't it? I mean, one of your
complaints is there's just no money in it. The claim is
not for that much.
MR. SULLIVAN: The goal here, Judge, is not
money. The goal here, I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it shouldn't be
the goal. But we're inquiring into the question of
whether granting punitive damages will increase or
decrease the number of lawsuits.
I -- I -- I would think it would be
astounding if it would decrease the number of lawsuits.
MR. SULLIVAN: I think it would decrease the
incidence when medical care is denied.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- there wouldn't
be any maintenance and cure claim if the system worked
as it was intended; that is, that if you have a sailor
who is injured, the ship owner pays room and board and
medical expenses.
MR. SULLIVAN: That's all it is, Your Honor.
Just say if the ship owner will treat the seaman fairly,
will follow the doctor's recommendations, get him to a
doctor, give him treatment so he gets better, there's --
I mean, you are saying there may be more claims for
punitive damages, but there will be more awards of
punitive damages because there won't be this willful and
wanton, callous disregard of the seaman's rights.
And so, I would suggest that, in fact, in
this narrow area of the law, if you impose punitive
damages, actual punitive conduct, conduct that deserves
punishment will go down and it will go down rapidly.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish it were as clearcut
as that. I mean, what if the seaman says, you know, I
should have had this very expensive treatment? And the
ship owner's medical counsel said, no, this treatment is
not necessary.
Is that -- is that a punitive damages claim?
I bet it is.
MR. SULLIVAN: I don't think so, Judge. I
think those kind of cases should be weeded out on
summary judgment by the courts -- by the district court,
because we're only talking about the willful, wanton and
callous withholding.
JUSTICE SCALIA: He's going to say that was
willful and wanton. I obviously needed this more
expensive treatment. He just didn't want to pay the
money.
MR. SULLIVAN: And the court is going to
have to -- the district courts are going to have to make
a judgment as to the bona fides of that case. But I
think that you are going to find that it is very rare
when somebody is going to act callously when the
potential on the other side is that they are going to be
awarded -- have punitive damages awarded against them.
And that, therefore, this is going to be a
corrective mechanism that's going to do away with the
problem we currently have now and make the plaintiffs
even better.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, it --
whether it gives rise to more litigation or not, it is
still a significant and will give rise to greater costs
on the part of the shipper which will be passed on, as
is the case in a lot of areas where you have punitive
damages, it will be passed on to the consumer.
MR. SULLIVAN: If the punitive damages are
awarded. But the hope, of course, is that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, even if
they're not. In other words, you were saying, look, to
avoid punitive damages, the ship owner is going to make
sure that there -- that that more expensive test is
provided.
MR. SULLIVAN: It's going to err on behalf
of the seaman. Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't mean
there are no costs involved in ruling in your favor.
MR. SULLIVAN: That's true, Judge. But here
again, we're balancing the interest of somebody who is
injured and whose condition may become permanent and
incurable by virtue of not getting prompt care as
opposed to the limited costs to the ship owner of
providing a doctor who is going to determine what the
best care is. And that's all we asking for, the best
care that medical care can currently provide to get the
seaman to maximum cure.
If there are no further questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. SULLIVAN: Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. McCreadie, you
have three minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McCREADIE: Justice Ginsburg, I wanted
to respond first to a question that you asked that I
think there may have been some confusion with respect to
the answer.
There is pain and suffering available in a
maintenance and cure claim if the failure to pay the
maintenance and cure causes injury, causes hurt. That's
what we understand from reading the Osceola and Iroquois
as interpreted by Cortes.
So, I didn't want you to be left with the
impression that even if a maintenance and cure claim was
--
brought by itself, if there's some injury, some damage
beyond the failure to receive the maintenance and cure,
there is a cause of action that could lead to, I think
as you put it, the higher award and, hence, attorneys
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that a separate cause
of action? Or is it just part of the maintenance and
cure act?
MR. McCREADIE: It's -- it's maintenance and
cure and it can be brought either under the maintenance
and cure with an injury or it can be brought under the
Jones Act. You can choose your cause of action. You
just don't recover twice.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- are you then
disputing what your colleague said about lawyers being
reluctant to take maintenance and cure claims that are
not tied with a Jones Act claim?
MR. McCREADIE: Justice Ginsburg, we're
relying on Supreme Court precedent as opposed to
anecdotal information. But to answer your question
specifically, that's why I'm explaining that they do
have the right to bring a personal injury component to a
maintenance and cure claim.
And the other point I wanted to make in the
Ninth and Fifth Circuits those are the circuits of
Guevara and Roy Al, where punitive damages have been
clearly eliminated from a maintenance and cure claim for
willful failure to pay. Since 1995 there's no dearth of
cases. Those remain two of the most active circuits in
the country for seamen's cases. And whether they are
filing as just maintenance and cure or combining with
the Jones Act, the ratio would probably be the same as
any other circuit.
There was also a question about the Vaughan
and -- and what the dissent knew or didn't know; and
reference to McCormick on damages. I think, again, it
is a small point but it is interesting to point out that
McCormick on damages, the same volume that the dissent
referred to, specifically states that punitive damages
are not available under FELA -- under the FELA. And, of
course, the Jones Act incorporates FELA by reference.
Really the Vaughan dissent did not have the
benefit of Miles when it reached its decision. If that
court had had the benefit, we believe they would have
found punitive damages are not available.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:10 p.m., the case in the
