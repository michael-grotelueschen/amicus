Nike.
Mr. Dabney.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DABNEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Article III question in this case turns
on resolution of two issues: First, whether loss of
freedom to operate on the part of a direct competitor
qualifies as Article III injury in fact; and, second,
what party bears the burden of proof of facts that are
contended by it to render a claim moot.
The counterclaim in this case seeks to
extinguish a source of cost, risk, and official
restraint on what footwear products the Petitioner can
and cannot legally sell. These are classic forms of
injury in fact.
On the burden of proof point, the proponent
of a factual contention always bears the burden of
proving this, and this is especially true when the
question arises in the context of a claim that a
voluntary act has allegedly ousted a Federal court of
jurisdiction.
Mootness doctrine protects a party seeking
relief from the kind of evasive maneuvering that's
happened in this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if I were to write
an -- an opinion indicating that there's a chill here
because distributors and retailers will see that there's
been this suit against the -- your client and they will
be reluctant to distribute, would there -- would I just
make that up? Or is there something I can read to find
out -- to find that out, or --
MR. DABNEY: Injury in fact is a question of
fact, and injury in fact is based on evidence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the -- the evidence
here was that they did need investors, and investors
were reluctant.
MR. DABNEY: That's correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It wasn't specific
evidence, but then I -- anything besides that?
MR. DABNEY: There are three forms of injury
in this case. The first is that the Petitioner's cost
of operation is increased because the disputed claim was
not expunged. When the Petitioner designs and sells new
products, it has to go through an incredibly costly
process to determine whether or not its next line of
shoes might give rise to a plausible claim --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Is that -- is that
in the record?
MR. DABNEY: It certainly is. The
Petitioner says, through its president, on page 173 of
the Joint Appendix, that he's engaged in new --
development of new shoe lines, which by definition are
outside the scope of the covenant document.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: When you said it's
incredibly costly to do this and so forth, is that in
the record?
MR. DABNEY: That specific statement is not
in the record.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, it makes sense,
but I -- I'm a little reluctant to take judicial notice
of the shoe business. I mean --
MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, I'm glad you
brought that up because, under the mootness doctrine,
the burden of proof on that and every other fact
relevant to mootness fell on the Respondent. Under this
Court's precedents, the Respondent in this case, in
order to oust the district court of jurisdiction, had to
show two things to a high degree of probability. The
first thing the Respondent had to show is that it was
absolutely clear that the Petitioner could not
reasonably be expected --
JUSTICE BREYER: You're right, that's the
standard. And so you said that -- I mean, I feel
perhaps more calmly about this than I might feel is
warranted, but the -- the question is, is there anything
here that you -- so you said, by definition, we're going
to produce some new shoes, which new shoes are not -- do
not have the appearance of any current and/or previous
footwear product designs and any colorable imitations
thereof.
So I would like you to refer me to the
record where your president of your client or somebody
else says, we are intending to produce some new shoes
that fall outside that definition, and of course, I will
look at that, because your opponent says we can find no
reasonable likelihood that they are going to produce
anything or they have any present intent of showing --
of producing something that falls outside that
definition.
But now, you just said, oh, no, we're
definitely going to. So just refer me to those pages in
the record that shows that because, of course, you win,
if that's true.
MR. DABNEY: Page 173A of the record, of the
Joint Appendix, states that, "The Petitioner is"
intending -- "is regularly engaged in the design of new
footwear."
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but that isn't the
point. The point is, is the new footwear that you're
designing footwear that is not -- does not have the
appearance of any current or previous footwear product
designs or any colorable imitation thereof? And so to
say you are in the business of producing new footwear,
at least, to me, suggests nothing because the question
is what the footwear looks like, not that you're
producing new footwear.
MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, in the real world,
a business competitor --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not interested in
the real world. I am interested in the record.
MR. DABNEY: The record does not show that
the Petitioner lacks any concrete interest in entering
the line of commerce that --
JUSTICE BREYER: And does it show anything
at all in respect that would support the claim that you
are going to produce new footwear that doesn't either
resemble, nor is a colorable imitation of anything that
you have previously produced or is the subject of the
case?
MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, what the record
shows -- and it is what it is -- is that the petitioner
is actively engaged in designing and bringing out new
footwear products and --
JUSTICE BREYER: Period?
MR. DABNEY: Period.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So I take it that
this case really boils down to should you have -- should
they have or you both have another chance to say what
the new footwear will be -- look like under a new
standard, or is there enough here already to say, well,
really, the judges could conclude that there is no real
likelihood that you're going to produce something that
won't look like what's already been produced.
MR. DABNEY: We would respectfully submit
that, when you apply the mootness doctrine, since we're
not talking about picking a fight here, we're talking
about someone who was sued once -- once bitten, twice
shy -- that when someone has been sued for alleged
infringement has asked for a judgment that would
eliminate any need to think about whether or not a new
shoe will attract --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and I assume that was
your point, that you shouldn't be put through the
trouble of figuring out whether the new shoes that you
produce are close enough to the old one to be covered or
are not. You're at risk --
MR. DABNEY: Exactly.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- right?
MR. DABNEY: Exactly.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I would think that you
would add this as well, that, for a competitor to demand
that the other competitor tell its plans, its marketing,
is, to say the least, patronizing, and -- and probably
quite injurious, in and of itself.
MR. DABNEY: That would itself be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, again, there's -- do
I just know that because I'm a judge? Or is there
someplace I can look for that?
MR. DABNEY: The law is that, as I stand
here today, the government has registered a claim that
the Petitioner is duty-bound not to bring out the shoe
shown in the registration, number one, which according
to the Respondent is one of the best-selling, most
profitable shoe styles of all time; and also, as I stand
here today, the law is that Petitioner is at risk if it
brings out a shoe that is going to be giving rise to a
plausible claim --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Dabney, are you
saying that this device of the unilateral covenant is no
good, unless it says that you will never be sued for any
shoe that you ever produce? Is -- are you saying that
the covenant is no good or that this covenant is
deficient?
MR. DABNEY: I'm saying that the Respondent
bore the burden of proving that the covenant completely
and irrevocably eradicated all of that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- if -- if you are
uneasy about the covenant as it exists, why didn't you
say, judge, this covenant doesn't give us adequate
protection, it should be amended, and then say what you
think you need to be adequately covered?
MR. DABNEY: Because the Petitioner asks for
judgment in accordance with law, and it would prefer not
to be the involuntary licensee of the Respondent that
sued it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, does that mean
that, if they gave you a covenant that said, vis-Ã -vis
your company, our trademark, the form of this shoe, is
invalid, we won't sue you for anything, either an exact
duplicate or any colorable imitation thereof with
respect to this design; would that be enough for you?
MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, again --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know you want to help
everybody else --
MR. DABNEY: Not -- no --
JUDGE SOTOMAYOR: -- but why wouldn't that
be --
MR. DABNEY: That's -- that's not actually
right. The reason why -- 70 years ago, Learned Hand
created the metaphor, "the scarecrow patent." And the
reason scarecrows are effective is not because they are
likely to climb down from the pole, but because, from a
distance and being looked at quickly, the way people in
the marketplace have to react to official government
records of claims, they're deceptive. So --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You get a lot of
what this extra stuff -- you know, that you say, well,
even if this is all right, they're not going to sue me
for that, there's all the collateral damage. You get a
significant amount of that by the covenant not to sue.
Nike can't go around giving out these covenants left and
right because, if they do, they will undermine their own
trademark.
MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, the -- the covenant
actually reasserts the allegation that these shoes
infringe. The covenant does nothing more than purport
to waive --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does it --
where does it do that?
MR. DABNEY: It says it right on the -- on
page -- I believe it is 96 of -- of the record, where it
says, in the second whereas, "the actions complained of
no longer infringe or dilute at a level sufficient to
warrant the substantial time and expense." I mean, it
libels --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So if you
take -- if that were taken out, is your case the same or
not?
MR. DABNEY: There would be one small little
less bit of injury in this case. That's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess maybe
this is the same question Justice Ginsburg was asking.
You're -- you're a lawyer in this area. You want to
write a covenant that will satisfy the fellow on the
other side, but what does it say? Can you do that? Or
do you have to say, the only way this case can be
rendered moot is if the trademark is totally
invalidated?
MR. DABNEY: When someone seeks --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, that's kind
of a yes or no answer. Can you write a covenant that
says something other than the trademark is totally
invalidated?
MR. DABNEY: No.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But why?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what you're saying is
you --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're saying
that, in this case, there's no way -- I mean, I thought
it was a practice that was not unprecedented for parties
to grant covenants of this sort. You're saying this is
unheard of, nobody -- nobody can do this?
MR. DABNEY: The practice in this case dates
to 1995. This is a totally recent, controversial
practice that has never been embraced by this Court at
all. In fact, it was articulated in a case two years
after --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But that's not the question,
Mr. Dabney. The question is: Is there any covenant
that exists in the world that would make you feel
secure? And I suppose I'm having a little bit of
difficulty with the answer, with an answer that says,
no, there is no covenant that you can write that would
make us feel secure.
MR. DABNEY: The -- the reason is, Your
Honor, that the registration causes informational
injury. And what the Respondent is trying to do is to
hang on to government action that disadvantages its
competitor, while --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I don't know why --
my solution was that they would give you a covenant
that I suggested as a possibility that would say,
vis-Ã -vis you, you can imitate, counterfeit, use this
design, only vis-Ã -vis you. Why doesn't that protect
you fully? Because what they're saying to you is, copy
the design if you want, so long as you're not using
another trademark. But that's not the issue. The issue
is whether you're infringing this design.
MR. DABNEY: The question the trademark
practitioners get asked every day is whether something
is available. And so long as that question is asked, a
covenant that's in the file of a company is not going to
prevent deception and confusion of people who look and
say, oh, this is a protected design.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dabney, that's a
different answer than the one you gave me when I asked
the same question. You said because we don't want to be
an involuntary licensee of Nike.
MR. DABNEY: That is a second form of injury
that we have now, as Justice Scalia pointed out. Right
now, we cannot just ignore the claim and bring out
either this -- a YUMS version --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But can you -- can you
just explain to me -- you've given a name to this carte
blanche that -- that Nike would give you. What is the
significance of your being an involuntary licensee?
It's not something that -- that you wear as a brand. I
mean --
MR. DABNEY: What we've substituted is
instead of getting a judgment in accordance with law
that expunges the allegedly invalid
government-registered claim of right to exclude
competition and sale of goods in favor of the chance to
litigate with our arch rival to see whether they will
prove --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you're going back to
saying the covenant -- no covenant is any good.
MR. DABNEY: A covenant that leaves the
covenantor in possession of the unreviewed government
benefit that it got --
JUSTICE BREYER: But that look -- I mean,
maybe you could suggest to me that I -- that we should
change what the law has been or not follow it here, but
where I'm taking the law from is Friends of the Earth.
MR. DABNEY: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: And in Friends of the
Earth, it says a defendant -- namely Nike -- claiming
its voluntary compliance moots a case, and what they're
claiming is that this -- a covenant moots the case,
moots the case, the covenant they gave, there's the
formidable burden -- you know, it's formidable, you're
quite right -- of showing it is absolutely clear,
correct, that the allegedly wrongful behavior, namely,
their suing, but their suing in respect to this kind of
shoe, could not reasonably be expected to recur.
And they say, since we promised in an
enforceable promise not to repeat this behavior ever --
100 years, how could it be expected reasonably to recur?
How could our behavior, namely suing for infringement in
respect to a shoe like this, be reasonably expected to
recur, given our covenant? And your response to that
is?
MR. DABNEY: The claim the counterclaim
seeks to extinguish is not simply the particular rights
of action that they have covenanted not to exert. The
claim that is sought to be extinguished is the much
broader government-registered claim of right to exclude
competition in the sale of shoes that embody that design.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dabney --
MR. DABNEY: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if you had the --
the various interests that you're asserting now -- we're
not talking about mootness, but we're talking about
Article III standing.
MR. DABNEY: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm looking at what
you're alleging, that you have plans to introduce
particular shoes. People are considering investing in
your company. Your opponent has intimidated retailers.
If you brought a suit by yourself, is that sufficient to
establish Article III standings? Are those the sort of
concrete and tangible injuries that we've required?
MR. DABNEY: I would say we have very
distinct and concrete and palpable injury in that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just because you
plan to introduce a particular line of shoes, you can
bring a lawsuit?
MR. DABNEY: No.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Okay. Just
because people are considering investing -- somebody who
came in and said, I've got this company, people are
thinking of investing in it, and therefore, you want to
proceed with your lawsuit?
MR. DABNEY: It is undeniable, by law, that
the Petitioner's cost of operation -- the petitioner's
Risk of operation is increased because of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that surely
would not establish Article III standings. Everybody's
cost of operation is increased whenever there's any
trademark at all because you have to check and see
whether it violates a trademark.
MR. DABNEY: Yes, but we're a direct
competitor, which we say is currently subject to an
unlawful restraint on our freedom to operate.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dabney, suppose there
had been no infringement claim, could you have -- but
you're in the shoe business and you're -- you're
worried -- could you have brought a declaratory action
or an action for an injunction to have the trademark
declared invalid?
MR. DABNEY: When our shoes were launched,
it obviously never even occurred to the petitioner that
they could be deemed an infringement of any rights of
this respondent. So the answer is we were not injured
at that point. But now, that we've been sued -- once
bitten, twice shy -- we now have been told by the
respondent that it claims a far-reaching claim of right
to exclude competition in the sale of goods.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you say you could not
have brought a suit to -- to cancel?
MR. DABNEY: The three-part test of
injury-in-fact is universally applicable. So we did not
allege -- and I don't believe we had injury-in-fact when
our shoes were launched. So, no, of course, there would
not have been a suit that could be brought at that time.
But since we're in a mootness case and we've been sued
and we've been told and have all these defamatory
allegations about and dragged our company's name through
the mud, the situation is different, as Your Honor has
said.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But if that's the case -- if
the difference is that you've been sued, then it should
be adequate protection, if you know that you won't be
sued again. And that's why there's the question of what
kind of covenant would give you adequate protection that
you won't be sued again?
MR. DABNEY: If the -- as I said before, if
the only injury we were complaining about and trying to
extinguish was the injury that flows from being sued
again by this Respondent, then I suppose you could --
you could conceive of a covenant that would extinguish
that injury.
But in trademark registration practice, it
has been routinely heard by Federal courts -- we cite
two on page 8 of our reply brief -- that the kind of
injury that Petitioner is complaining about in this case
has been heard and adjudicated by Federal courts for
decades. We cite two cases, 85 years apart. It is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Dabney, you told
me that you could not bring such an independent suit,
you have to be stung once. So you can bring it as a
counterclaim, as you did here, once there's an
infringement suit, but you -- you did say that you could
not just walk into court and say, I want an injunction
invalidating the trademark.
MR. DABNEY: Well, let me clarify. The
Petitioner totally agrees there has to be injury in fact
in all cases. And so my answer to your question in this
hypothetical question is we would have to allege
adequate injury. And the -- the Chief Justice suggested
that increased cost of capital might or might not
qualify for injury in the -- in the initial standing
case where --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I suggested it
might not.
MR. DABNEY: Might not. That's right.
(Laughter.)
MR. DABNEY: So we have increased cost of
capital, increased costs of -- of design. And, of
course, we have the legal burden and duty to refrain
from making shoes now that would give rise to a
plausible claim on the part of the Respondent.
If there are no further questions, I would
like to reserve the rest of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Anders.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING VACATUR AND REMAND
MS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
A trademark holder can moot a declaratory
judgment action seeking to invalidate a trademark by
offering the plaintiff a sufficiently broad covenant not
to sue. Whether the covenant eliminates the controversy
between the parties should be analyzed under the
voluntary cessation doctrine.
The analysis that the government is
proposing is both a way of determining whether the
covenant has eliminated any concrete dispute between the
parties and also a framework for the parties to use to
negotiate the appropriate scope of the covenant.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Anders, what --
there is a question about why a competitor should have
to produce to its competition its future plans of
development. I mean, the marketplace, especially in
fashion, importantly, likes to keep quiet what it's
doing because what -- it doesn't want other imitators to
beat it to the punch.
So given that interest, why isn't their
claim that they're being inhibited because of the
requirement to produce their products -- or their
intended products -- enough to establish injury in this
case?
MS. ANDERS: Well, once the -- once the
defendant offers the covenant, then the question becomes
whether there is anything that the plaintiff is
intending to do, its current activities or its -- its
concrete plans for anticipated activities that would
fall outside the covenant and potentially be infringing.
Because if those activities exist, then the covenant has
not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, then what did --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could we say there is just
a presumption, that, if you're in the business, that you
probably are interested in future design, period?
MS. ANDERS: I don't think that -- I don't
think that presumption would establish a concrete
interest. The question here is whether --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Wouldn't establish a --
MS. ANDERS: It would not establish that the
plaintiff has a concrete interest. The question is
whether the dispute between the parties is reasonably
likely to recur. And if the plaintiff cannot point to
anything that it's currently doing or that it's planning
to do --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I read this affidavit as
saying, we're in the shoe industry, we're going to make
new shoes regularly, we want to copy their shoe, we
don't think it's protected by trademark, we want to copy
it -- they don't say -- and that's something on rebuttal
that maybe Petitioner will explain -- that we want to
copy it exactly. But what they're saying is, we want to
copy it because it's a free form. That's really what I
read their affidavit as saying.
So if -- why do they have to actually -- do
they have to produce their design to prove they're doing
that?
MS. ANDERS: I think what they have to do is
they have to state that they intend to make products
that may be outside the covenant. And now --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But saying it is enough?
That's what I thought their affidavit said, and I
thought the court below said, no, you've got to show us
the product.
MS. ANDERS: I think the -- the affidavit
says that they intend to produce new shoes as a general
matter. It doesn't tell us what those shoes may be,
whether they -- it doesn't give us a way of knowing
whether they might fall outside the covenant.
And I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please, now go back to
my question. Is it enough to just say it? Or do they
have to produce the designs, so that the Court and Nike
can decide -- it is Nike, right? -- the Court and Nike
can decide whether the shoe is a colorable imitation or
an exact copy.
MS. ANDERS: I think that could depend on
the breadth of the covenant. I think, in some cases,
for instance, if the covenant doesn't cover any future
products, it may be enough for the plaintiff to credibly
allege, we intend to make future products that aren't
covered.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I agree with you.
MS. ANDERS: So I also think that it may
depend -- the less far along a party's plans are to make
its shoes, the easier it will be for the defendant to
say, it is speculative that your plans will actually
mature into something that doesn't --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Anders, take this
case, where Already says -- you know, we're not really
going to say anything particular. We're just going to
say that we're in the business of making shoes, and we
might make a shoe. Would that -- would that -- that
would not be enough under your standard; is that
correct?
MS. ANDERS: I think that's right. I think
if the parties went back on remand in this case -- and
we do think there should be a remand here -- but if the
parties went back and we had the exact same facts, and
Nike said that anything that was a colorable imitation
of Already's shoes was covered by the covenant, and
Already came back and said, just generally, we're making
new shoes, I think, in that situation, it would be
relatively easy for Nike to show that the possibility
that Already would be impacted by the covenant -- or
impacted by the trademark, I'm sorry -- would be
speculative.
So that --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Given what Already has said
in this case, why is it that you think that we should
remand? I mean, it sounds as though we're remanding for
no purpose, given what Already has said throughout the
course of the litigation and, indeed, in this Court
today.
MS. ANDERS: I think there are two reasons.
The first is that, when this Court establishes a new
standard, it often -- it traditionally will remand to
allow the courts -- the lower courts to apply that
standard in the first instance.
And the second is that there was some
uncertainty about what the covenant meant below. So
Nike represented that the covenant covered the existing
shoes, and Already said, in its motion to dismiss
briefing, that it thought that the covenant did not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But its future -- its
future shoes are clearly -- and I thought the counsel
for the Petitioner might have -- might have added this
in his answer to Justice Sotomayor, that its future
shoes are not covered by this. And the -- if -- if Nike
has the heavy burden of proof, can it have discovery and
take depositions on what their plans are, what their
marketing plans are, what designs they're thinking
about?
MS. ANDERS: I think that would be one way
for Nike to try to establish that -- that the dispute is
not reasonably likely to recur. It could get discovery
into --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So then -- so then the
covenant not to sue gives Nike an advantage that no
other manufacturer has.
MS. ANDERS: I don't think it does give
the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you mean any
manufacturer without -- without any litigation can ask
Already, well, tell us your plans, what shoes are you
thinking about?
MS. ANDERS: Well, once Already produces --
once Already identifies what its future activities may
be -- and, again --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why should Already
have to do that to anybody?
MS. ANDERS: Well, we think it makes sense
for Already to have to -- have to at least identify here
what activities it thinks may not be outside the
covenant. And I don't think that hurts Already, and the
reason is that if -- if Already's evidence convinces the
court that the case isn't moot, then Already gets its
adjudication on the related --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So Nike has an advantage
over Already that no other manufacturers had. It can
demand what its future plans are.
MS. ANDERS: Well, it will get -- the
trademark will be -- will be adjudicated if -- if
Already convinces the Court the action isn't --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just ask one
question on that, and it's a little bit off of what
we've been talking about. You say, in your brief, well,
now, don't worry, what you can do is you can go to the
trademark -- the PTO board, and they'll -- they'll
adjudicate this mark. And so -- you know, you can
really go out of the courts and go to the
administrators.
Suppose Already goes to the administrative
agency and loses. Can it have judicial review? And is
there -- is standing easier to show, once there has been
an adverse action in the administrative office? Or are
we right back where we started? So once you go to the
agency and you try to appeal, the Court says, well, this
is an Article III court, we need a case of controversy,
and you're right back where we are now?
MS. ANDERS: Well, a couple of points on
that. The first is that we are not proposing that the
Court should dismiss discretionarily every action just
because the TTAB exists and can adjudicate --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was a big part of
your argument. You were telling us, oh, don't worry,
you can always go to the patent level.
MS. ANDERS: What we're proposing here is
that, as a function of the Court's broader discretion
under the Declaratory Judgment Act and United States v.
W. T. Grant, is that when the Court believes that it
probably does -- does have jurisdiction but it doesn't
think that the likelihood of a dispute is -- is really
that great, that in that situation, it can
discretionarily dismiss.
So that would be a situation in which there
is Article III --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. My -- my question is:
Is the Article III requirement that Already has the same
in this case as it would be if they sought judicial
review from an adverse order of the administrative
agency?
MS. ANDERS: The administrative agency's
standing rules are broader than Article III, so it
would -- it is easier to get --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about going to
court.
MS. ANDERS: And so once it goes to court,
there may be rare cases in which Already, as the party
that lost, if it isn't injured in fact by the TTAB's
decision itself, that it would not have the necessary
Article III injury to seek judicial review. That
hasn't -- to our knowledge, that has not occurred, but
it is possible that that could happen because 15 U.S.C.
64 makes the TTAB standing requirements broader than
in Article III.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Anders, you did say,
if I recall correctly, that Congress regarded the PTO as
the preferred form for cancellation proceedings. The --
the statute sets up the PTO proceeding, but it also
allows the claim to be brought in -- in court. So
what -- what shows that Congress meant these claims to
be -- to go to the agency in preference to the court?
MS. ANDERS: Well, I think Congress didn't
set it up as an exhaustion requirement, so I don't think
it's preferred for all of these claims to go to the TTAB.
But the TTAB is the expert body that -- that adjudicates
cancellation of validity issues all the time. So we think
there could be circumstances in which it would be
particularly appropriate for a district court to consider
the existence of the TTAB proceeding.
For instance, if there's a related
proceeding pending before the TTAB or there's a
concurrent proceeding, something like that, we think it
would make sense for the district court in considering
whether to dismiss the action to take that into account.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your
answer to Justice Kennedy's question might be that
the -- an adverse decision from the agency covering you
is an additional injury in fact that gives you Article
III standing, unless the -- unless the basis for the
agency's decision is you don't have any injury.
MS. ANDERS: I think there could be some
circumstances in which the TTAB's decision would create
injury in fact if it said something about the scope of
the trademark, something like that. So there could be
situations in which 1071 would then allow the losing
party to get judicial review.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Goldstein.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, thank you
very much, may it please the Court:
You will want to have available to you the
cert petition and the small volume of the Joint
Appendix.
In our submission, the Court needs to adopt
a rule that has balance to it, and that is there -- it
has to be possible to resolve one of these cases through
a covenant not to sue of appropriate breadth, but it
also has to be the case that a covenant not to sue can't
just always eliminate the other side's injury. And so
it's going to depend on the covenant and it's going to
depend on what the other side says about its plans.
And our point in this case is that you
should adopt the following rule: And that is, if you
have a covenant not to sue and it covers everything that
the other side alleges an intent to produce, then there
is no more injury. If it doesn't cover that, then there
may well be injury.
And our point --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you deal with the
point that's been discussed with your adversary, they
have to show you everything they intend to produce?
What entitles you to that showing?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely. So one thing
that's very important to recognize -- two things about
trademark practice. First is that, in all of these
cases -- remember, most of the time the question of
trademark or patent validity will just be a suit for
invalidity. It might be a counterclaim. This happens
all the time.
And in all of these cases, including this
case, there is a protective order, and there is one in
this case. And the protective order says that a party
can designate its material, so that it's lawyers' eyes
only, and so that no businessperson from the other side
is entitled to see it.
So that, Justice Kennedy, with respect, it's
actually not true that this is an unusual situation or
that we would get some special advantage.
In every single patent or trademark
invalidity case, after this Court's decision in
MedImmune, the party alleging invalidity, in order to
show its standing, has to say, we intend to make a
product that is regarded as potentially infringing.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if they simply
said --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you have the
trademark, we think it's invalid, we want to copy your
shoe? We want to copy just the form of your shoe
because that's what the trademark involves.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And once we have the
invalidity, that's what we're going to do.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would that be enough of
a showing? We don't have plans right now because your
trademark stopped us from having the plans, but the
minute your trademark is -- isn't validated, for sure,
we're going to do it because it's going to mean great
sales if we put our name on it, rather than your name.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. The answer to your
question is going to be yes, but it has two parts to it.
The first is -- because I really want to focus on
precisely what you said. You said first, what did they
simply say?
Now, if they were to simply say it, there
could be a factual inquiry into whether they're telling
the truth or not. We could debate -- we could have a
fight about the actual evidence. But let's assume they
could prove it, and that is, the district judge was told
by Already, or whatever other competitor, we want to
make a counterfeit.
In that case, unquestionably --
unquestionably -- there would be a continuing Article
III injury. And let's then go to your understanding of
what the declaration in this case actually says.
So, first, let me start with how the case
came to you, and that is the court of appeals, what it
understood the record -- and the district court
understood the record to be, and that is going to be in
the petition appendix at page --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, how the
case came to us -- how this case originated was a
counterclaim.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And at the time the
counterclaim was asserted, there was certainly Article
III jurisdiction over the counterclaim, right?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's absolutely right.
And we accept, for present purposes, that there is going
to be a reduced requirement under the voluntary
cessation doctrine. We briefed why we don't think
that's true, but I assume, for the purposes of these
answers, that the Court is going to apply the heightened
burden on us to show that the case is over.
And we believe that we showed beyond
peradventure -- that we really resolved this case, when
we didn't just dismiss our claim with prejudice, but we
affirmatively granted them a covenant not to sue that
covered not only their existing products. But, Justice
Kennedy, their future products -- and I'm glad to take you
to the language of the covenant -- because they are the
colorable imitations of their current products.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you that this covenant
covers an exact copy of your shoe?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: It does not. And if the
other side had said, in the district court, we have an
intention -- and this is Justice Sotomayor's point -- we
have an intention, we have a desire to make a copy of
your shoe, then there would be a case or controversy.
And it's in --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is -- is the
Petitioner -- do you anticipate that the Petitioner will
agree with you, that this covers future products?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, because although the
cert petition says that it doesn't, we have quite
stridently pointed out, in our briefing, that that was
completely inaccurate. And I'll just -- let's go to the
covenant. I don't think this is really that hard or
that controversial.
So if we go to the Joint Appendix, at pages
96 to 97, and so -- and -- and I remind you that the --
the question presented is -- is exactly what you're
saying, Justice Kennedy. I'll read it, so you don't
have to turn back to the cert petition.
And its premise was that the registrant
promises not to assert its mark against the party's then
existing commercial activities. So now, I'm in the
covenant itself, on page 97A, and this is what we
promised not to sue them about.
We have -- we have promised not to sue them,
and I'm five lines down from the top, on account of any
possible action based on or involving trademark
infringement, unfair competition or dilution, under
state or Federal law, based on the appearance of
Already's current -- okay, that's not future -- or
previous footwear product designs and any colorable
imitations. And that's what -- and that's what --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The colorful
imitations -- colorable --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Colorable.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The colorable imitations
are colorable imitations of their shoe?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't promised to
not sue them over colorable imitations of your shoe?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: That are not colorable
imitations of --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you have two
categories. You have current and previous, as to which
the covenant runs to everything. Then you have what you
say is future, and that has to be a colorable imitation.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it -- so it -- so it
does cover some future designs. And they're correct
about that, and you're incorrect.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, I -- I may
have confused things. This is the situation with the
covenant: Our covenant not to sue covers everything
they have made in the past, everything they were making
at the time and every future product of theirs that is a
colorable imitation.
Our point is not that it covers every future
shoe of theirs. We're on the same page in that respect.
You are absolutely right, Justice Kennedy, that there
are shoes that they could make in the future that would
not be covered by the covenant. There could be an
injury about that.
And so my point about the record in the case
and how the case was developed and how we might have
modified the covenant, if they had told us anything,
suggesting -- suggested anything outside the covenant
they might want to make, is let's look at what they
actually told the district court and the court of
appeals about what their intentions were.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's -- so it's a
question of -- of deficiency in their pleading. Suppose
they amended that counterclaim and said, as soon as we
are able, we want to do a counterfeit.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. It is not a deficiency
in the pleading. It's a deficiency in the proof. So my
point about this -- it's very important for the Court to
understand that this case was not dismissed just on the
pleadings. It wasn't just an insufficiency in their
allegation.
And they said, well, actually, we have more
that we want to say, because we actually can explain to
the courts that we want to make other shoes.
The case was decided on a fully developed
record. We moved to dismiss. They submitted five
declarations in response that described their intentions
precisely.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But suppose in a different
hypothetical case, they had said, what we want to do is
to copy Nike's shoe --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- what then should have
happened then, in your view?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. So I do -- I would
love to return to what actually happened. But in that
hypothetical, what would happen is that our motion to
dismiss would be denied, unless and until we could prove
that what they were saying wasn't true because it is
absolutely the case -- and it is a strong point in our
favor -- that you can't evade an attempt to invalidate
your trademark through a covenant not to sue because you
can't give a covenant not to sue over a counterfeit
because you are in real risk of being deemed to have
abandoned the mark because you're just --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? Why? I know you
said that in your brief, but if you give it -- yes, if
you -- if you say the -- the whole world can copy it,
but this covenant would give it to only one
manufacturer.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So why would you
abandon -- why would giving a covenant to Already amount
to abandonment of your mark?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. It is not a settled
question in the law. There is no case that has
considered this question. What a party claiming
abandonment would say is that we would have licensed
Already then to increase its production and its
distribution.
But even if one didn't agree with that,
Justice Ginsburg, my point would be this: And that is
you can't continually evade an attempt to invalidate
your mark because, certainly, the agree -- we would
agree that if you give a second one of these things out
or the third one, you would be abandoning the mark. I
have some actual facts for you about this, and that --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is it -- I would like
to know. I mean, I assume you ask them, do you have any
current or future plan to produce a shoe that would
violate our mark --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- or that might -- which
does not look at all like the present -- your present
shoe, and isn't even colorably like your present shoe,
do you have a plan to do such a thing, are you in the
process, is it likely?
And they say, no, it's not likely. That's
the end of it. They're just as if they manufactured
cell phones.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: But if they were to say --
you know, we make new shoes all the time.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: And this is some kind of
thing we might well consider, and we have people working
on it; and they are considering whether to do it or not,
it's well in the works -- they win. Okay?
What did they say?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Page 173 of the Joint
Appendix. They had every opportunity to describe
exactly what you wanted to know about, Justice Breyer.
We moved to dismiss the case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm making this as
simple as I can.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm a shoe manufacturer.
I want to make new designs, and I want to be free to
make the designs that I want.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If this mark isn't
validated --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I intend to copy as
much of it as I can.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't have any records
of doing the planning because the trademark was there.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But, for sure, given my
current shoe --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and the fact that
they thought I imitated them --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- meaning, you --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you invalidate the
mark, I'm going to copy as much of it as I can.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would that be enough?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In your mind, you're
saying --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, that would be fine.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You could do discovery
then?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. And, Justice
Sotomayor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the discovery is
going to show what?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The president comes in
and says exactly what I said. There are no plans --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: They're going to win.
They're going to win, Justice Sotomayor. And so for
your vote, I am resting my entire case on the fact that
you're understanding that this is what their affidavit
suggests that's just not right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, could you
go back to Justice Breyer's question and answer that?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes. So page 173 --
because there is a record here. You -- you don't have
to hypothesize. This was all on the table in the
district court. We said, they have no intention, no
desire, no nothing, to make something that is not
unambiguously covered by the covenant.
And Justice Ginsburg did point out, in
passing, that if they said something to the contrary, we
would have modified the covenant. So here's what they
said -- and I -- it would take a lot of your time for me
to read all seven paragraphs on page 173, but they
don't --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. You don't have to
read to us.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. So these paragraphs
do not say -- they do not suggest, they do not imply --
even between the lines -- an intention to make something
that is outside the covenant. They just don't. And
that's --
JUSTICE BREYER: What they say is that they
changed this at the rate of a mile a minute -- you know,
they have -- they have stuff they put out, and we have
the YUMS and the Sweet -- whatever it is and the Jelly
Bean and so forth, and we keep changing it.
And so I don't know. I mean, it doesn't
seem clear, one way or the other. If it is -- if I come
to that conclusion, is it the case -- I thought perhaps,
in looking at this, that the line I quoted -- remember,
which puts a lot of burden on you, from Friends of the
Earth -- is not quoted in the district court, not quoted
in the Court of Appeals, so perhaps the thing -- I think
the SG wants something like it.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: So you say, okay, this is
the standard; it's tough for Nike to show this. You
seem to have conducted this case without that standard
quite in mind. It's tough for Nike, but they can do
it -- you know, depending on the facts, and you have
these protective orders, da, da, da, so send it back,
use the right standard, and give Nike a chance and give
them a chance, and that way, we --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought what they were
arguing --
JUSTICE BREYER: What about that? I would
like to know what the answer to that question is here.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Do you want --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Answer
Justice Breyer's question.
JUSTICE BREYER: Excellent.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: All right. Justice Breyer,
so you've got a choice. You could let us win now, or
you could say, well, maybe you will win on remand.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's your opinion,
that you will win on remand. Okay.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Right.
(Laughter.)
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. And, Justice Breyer,
I have two answers for you.  Number one is going -- the
first one is going to be about the facts of the case,
and the second is just going to be jurisprudential. The
first one is what more could one imagine in such an
opinion that you would ask Nike to do on a remand?
JUSTICE BREYER: I would ask Nike, I
suppose, Nike could say -- you know, I read the page 73
and you changed things at the rate of mile a minute, and
we looked at YUMS and Jelly Bean, and they're sort of
like our shoe, but we didn't think enough, but you did
think enough, and are some of these changes that could
happen at a mile a minute -- is there any reason to
think -- you know, that they won't look really colorably
even like what you just did, but nonetheless, is a
pretty good point that they might infringe our -- our
present trademark.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's a long question, I
don't know if I'll get a good answer.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I hope you'll get a
good answer. The -- my point is this, Justice Breyer:
what you've just said on remand, what we would do is ask
a question. We wouldn't try to prove and anything. My
point is this: Already has told the district court, the
court of appeals, and this Court everything that it
wants to say about its intentions.
It has had every opportunity in every court
to have its lawyers simply say, Justice Sotomayor, this
is not an accident. The reason they are not saying that
they want to make a covenant of the -- a copy of the Air
Force 1 is that they don't want to make a copy of the
Air Force 1. There is no reason in the world to send
this back to give -- ask Already, again, the question
that has been asked in three separate courts.
I said I had a jurisprudential --
jurisprudential answer to you as well, and that is the
case was presented to you as presenting a question of
law, and that is, can you have a covenant not to sue
that will end a case like this?
And if you tell the lower courts, we don't
know, you are doing, I think, not as much of a service
to the development of the law as you could. It is a
much more sound approach, we think, to say Already had
the chance to build its record --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, can you
inform us of when this practice of the unilateral
covenant in order to moot a -- a cancellation claim,
when -- how long has it been around?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is still -- it has been
around for at least 20 years. It is still not very
common for the very important reason that trademark
owners know that, if they hand these things out, they
are at risk of having their mark invalidated; and
second, they know that it doesn't avoid a -- a
determination of the validity of the mark because a
party like Already can always go to the Federal agency,
the TTAB.
So I said I have some actual facts. And the
facts are these: Although Nike has a broad trademark
portfolio, it has only, once in its history, issued a
covenant not to sue. It is in this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's because it usually
sues. Page -- page 114 of the Joint Appendix says,
"Your Honor, over the past eight months, Nike has
cleared out the worst offending infringers. Now,
Already remains as one of the last few companies that
was identified on that top ten list of infringers."
I mean, that -- that's your company's
policy. That's your attorney, I take it.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: We -- Justice Kennedy, we do
enforce our trademarks. You say we usually sue. I will
tell you that we have filed six trade dress actions in
the company's history.
Now, you had said, because I think it's the
other side's -- the impression the other side has given,
that we are getting a special advantage over them. I
think it's really important to recognize, for purposes
of standing doctrine and mootness doctrine, that of all
the shoe manufacturers in the country, the one that is
least likely to be injured by this trademark -- there is
only one.
And it is Already because they are the only
company in the entire world that has a promise that's
substantial not to be sued under this trademark. We are
the one -- they are the ones that are least likely to
come into conflict with Nike. Now, they --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's because
you gave them the covenant after you sued them.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes, that's right, but
we did give them the covenant. That's my point. After
the covenant -- we didn't merely withdraw the case. I
have one other piece of fact.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what -- what's the
consideration -- I used to teach contract law. This
is -- you know, you can just give a covenant like that?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, we're judicially
estopped. It's not a contract. We are estopped, and
they have -- the district court acted in reliance on it,
construed it, and so we are bound by it. It's not a
contract.
I did have one other fact for you, because
the other side has given you this impression that, once
bitten, twice shy; that if you are sued once for a
trademark -- they have a special fear that they're in
the cross-hairs, that we're watching everything that
they do. So when they made this argument --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: They are on the top ten
list of infringers.
(Laughter.)
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. They are on the top
ten list of infringers. But after that -- after that
they, and they alone, got a covenant not to be sued,
under the -- they are the -- they are in the specially
protected position, not a specially disadvantaged
position.
I did, however -- when they made this
argument in the reply brief -- tried to figure out if
that is true. Is it actually the case that a person who
is sued once has a legitimate worry that they will
actually be sued again?
So you should lower the -- the mootness or
standing bar still further. So we looked at every
single trademark action between 2000 -- January 1, 2000,
and December 31, 2004, all of them. There were 593.
And over the next eight years, we tried to figure out
how many times did the plaintiff sue the defendant
again. It happened six times, so --
JUSTICE BREYER: I see that. But I thought
your response to Justice Kennedy was a different one. I
liked it because it was that -- the concern that Nike
can go and find out the competitor's plans is true, but
it exists whenever a -- a -- a manufacturer brings a
trademark infringement case because that manufacturer
has to show he is now making the product; or, if not, he
intends to. And if it's a question of intends to, then
the defendant can go and look and see if that's true.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: And your response, I took
it, to that was there are procedures that deal with
that. They're called protective orders and so forth.
Is that -- have I got that right with your argument?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: You could not -- you could
not be more right.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what your argument
is, yes.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's also the truth that --
that it is what happens in every single patent and
trademark invalidity case. If you believe that gives rise
to Article III injury, then every party has standing to
challenge every competitor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, what about
Federal Rule 41(a)(2)? It says, if the defendant has
pleaded a counterclaim -- and you have recognized that
there was Article III jurisdiction over that
counterclaim -- the case may be dismissed on the
plaintiff's request over the defendant's objection, only
if the counterclaim can remain pending for independent
adjudication.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So on the face of it, it
seems that this -- that that rule fits this case to a T;
that is, the -- plaintiff wants the case withdrawn,
defendant objects, and the question is can the
counterclaim remain pending for independent
adjudication.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. I think the reason
they did not pursue the Rule 41 argument in this Court
and abandoned it is that it's completely understood
that, if the party that's instituting the claim says I'm
not going to pursue my case at all, there simply is no
Article III jurisdiction. And so even without a Rule 41
dismissal, there is no case or controversy remaining in
the case.
The district court -- the court of appeals
might also have said, when it's dealt with this issue on
8(a) and 9(a) of the petition appendix, that they
actually acceded to the dismissal of our claims.
They're happy to have our claims gone. And you can't
say, we'll take the dismissal of the -- sorry -- the
plaintiff's claim, but want to have the counterclaim
remaining.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you referred, just
in a fleeting way, to the fact that they can go to the
PTO and to the board?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about my question,
and I wasn't -- it was probably my fault --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I understand --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I didn't quite
understand the government's petition. Is the standing
burden any less after there is a -- an administrative
adjudication and you go to court for judicial review?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: The Chief Justice suggested
an argument that could be made. It is an argument that
we disagree with. We've looked at the cases. We think
that it's a point in their favor, Justice Kennedy, that,
while you can go to the TTAB, they wouldn't be able to
appeal to an Article III court. I think that's a point
in their favor.
A point in our favor, however, is this
notion of scarecrow trademarks hanging out there on the
fields is inaccurate because of the ability to go to the
TTAB in the first instance; they're experts. And
second, remember what I said to Justice Sotomayor,
anybody in this market can say we want to counterfeit
the Air Force 1 -- we just want to make a copy of it,
it's not complicated -- and they will have the right to
bring a claim to invalidate the mark. So we can't leave
the trademark hanging out there.
I have kept trying to come back -- and if I
could, in my remaining time, to the understanding of the
lower courts about the record because I said, Justice
Breyer, I think it would be much better for you to
resolve the case because they had the opportunity to
build a record, the case came to you on two courts'
understanding of the record, and so if I could take you
back to 14(a) and 15(a) of the petition appendix?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I interject just one
thing that I would like you to clarify? Justice Breyer
started out by saying the standard comes from Friends of
the Earth. Do you agree? Because, as I recall, your
brief doesn't -- doesn't even cite Friends of the Earth.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's not correct, Justice
Ginsburg. So on -- we do disagree because of the
Court's decision in Deakins, that this a voluntary
cessation case, but we accept for present purposes, so
you don't think I'm fighting the hypothetical.
Assuming that voluntary cessation principles
apply, here's how they apply: When you not just dismiss
the case, but you grant the covenant not to sue, and the
covenant not to sue says, I won't sue you over what
you're doing now or anything that I can imagine you
doing in the future because you haven't told me anything
else, then you have ensured that the controversy can't
arise again, and you've met the Voluntary Cessation
Doctrine.
If, on the other hand, the other side comes
forward with a declaration from an officer or some other
form of proof that says, no, I'm worried I might do
something outside the covenant, I would definitely want
to make a counterfeit, then the case is going to go on.
But this case is not that hypothetical case.
On 14(a), the first full paragraph, seven lines from the
bottom, "Given the similarity of YUMS' designs to the
'905 mark and the breadth of the covenant, it is hard to
imagine a scenario that would potentially infringe the
'905 mark and yet not fall under the covenant. YUMS has
not asserted any intention to market any such shoe."
And then in footnote 5, on 15(a), "Given the
absence of record evidence that YUMS intends to make any
arguably infringing shoe that is not unambiguously
covered by the covenant, this hypothetical possibility
does not create a definite and concrete dispute."
That's how the case should be resolved. You
should say, yes, there can be other cases where the
covenant is too narrow; yes, there can be other cases
where someone does allege a desire to make a
counterfeit. Those are different cases. But do not, I
suggest to you, remand when the facts have already been
developed in this case.
If we lose on this record, we lose on this
record. But if we win on this record, we win on it
because the record has been built in this case and it is
settled.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are saying that
you've met -- if we decide you bear the burden of proof,
you're saying, you -- you could live with that.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And your burden was met
by their submissions?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Our burden was met by our
submission of the covenant, which dealt with every
product they're making and every colorable imitation in
the future of it. And when they didn't then come back
and say, actually, we want to make something that might
be outside the covenant, then it was -- that's -- that's
when we won the case.
Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Dabney, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, the covenant --
the -- the affidavits in this case were prepared about
five weeks after this completely unexpected development
in the middle of a hard-pressed litigation was made.
And the position that the Petitioner made to
the district court was there is obviously subject matter
jurisdiction here, not just because of the Rule 41
point, but that you can't say, well, we have a case that
raises these three issues. You could, say, enter a
single judgment right now, the plaintiff's claims are
waived because they've waived them, the trademark is
invalid, and the registration was unlawfully issued and
should be granted.
Courts issue judgments on the basis of
alternative holdings all the time. And the only reason
why we're even talking about this is that Judge Sullivan
bifurcated the proceedings so that we dealt with this
one issue in isolation, and then the other thing came up
separately. So we said, we think there's a case right
now, but if you doubt it, we request leave to amend our
counterclaim to assert claims for invalid procurement of
registration and other things that could have been
asserted.
So the -- the state of the record reflects
the -- the suddenness with which the -- the plaintiff
most unexpectedly did what it now says, in public, it's
never done before and dropped its claim so unexpectedly
in the case.
So there's no question, but that if -- if it
turns out that it's not enough to say that we're
actively engaged, and we want to do all of the things
any person in a normal position would want to do, and we
have a concrete interest, the -- the defendant can
certainly allege more than what it has been alleged.
The -- the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: His challenge, you said
you had the chance in three different courts to say
directly and unequivocally, if the mark is invalid,
we're going to imitate, and you haven't been willing to
do that. You --
MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, the Petitioner has
been trying now for two and a half years to establish
its right to do that. It was not our understanding
that, under the law, as it stood, that the -- in
addition to staying we have an enormous commercial
interest in doing this, and we are seeking the right to
do this since --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's your commercial
interest?
MR. DABNEY: The commercial interest is to
partake of this very large and lucrative business that
the Respondent's evidence shows in this case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you willing to
make the statement he's asked you for? You keep
equivocating on the answer.
I -- you know, it's like I don't want to say
it, is what you're telling us.
MR. DABNEY: I -- I think it is -- first of
all, the -- the Petitioner, up until now, has said what
he said. I could stand here and say I believe that, if
the registration were cancelled, it is highly likely
that the Petitioner would bring out a YUMS shoe.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, look, how are
you hurt then? Because suppose he wins here. Now, you,
if you have the president of the company say, hey, I'm
going to do an exact copy, go bring a -- go bring a
cancellation action.
If you can't quite say that -- you know, you
can start one -- you can't quite say that, but he says
something sort of vague about it that's close, go to the
PTO. And if he can't say anything like that at all,
well, then, maybe you should lose. I mean, that's --
that's -- what's the practical problem with that?
MR. DABNEY: The practical problem here is
that, in the procedural posture of this case, which is
analogous to a summary judgment situation, all
inferences, all reasonable inferences need to be drawn
in favor of the nonmoving party. The suggestion that we
had the opportunity to develop the record is completely
incorrect.
There wasn't even oral argument on this
motion. The district court never gave us any
opportunity to put in evidence, other than to come in
and say, we have what we believe is a basis for
jurisdiction now, Rule 41(a)(2) precludes you from
dismissing our counterclaim, but if you think what we've
alleged now is not enough, we request leave to amend our
pleading.
So to force us to start all over again in a
new suit is -- would be fundamentally unfair to the
Petitioner. And what we're seeking here is simply
judicial review.
We're seeking the -- the ability to obtain
extinguishment, not just of the particular claims that
this Plaintiff saw fit to waive, but the much broader
government-registered claim of right to exclude
competition in the sale of shoes, and the fact that --
