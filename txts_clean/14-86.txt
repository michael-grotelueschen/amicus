CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 14-86, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores.
Mr. Gershengorn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The Tenth Circuit imposed two requirements
on religious accommodation claims that eliminated
liability for Respondent's refusal to accommodate
Ms. Elauf here:  First, that the applicant herself
verbally requested the accommodation; and second, that
the employer know, rather than just correctly
understand, the need for an accommodation.
Neither required --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand.  What
is the difference between knowing and correctly
understanding?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, the
testimony -- it -- it's a fair question.  The Tenth
Circuit perceived a difference.  What the testimony was
was that Ms. Cooke assumed that the -- that Ms. Elauf
needed to wear the headscarf because she was religious,
that she figured that the headscarf signified that it
was a religious headscarf, and that she figured it was a
religious headscarf.  What the Tenth Circuit said was
that was insufficient; what was needed was actual
knowledge.
Our position is that when you figure, when
you assume, when you -- when it signifies to you that a
religious accommodation is needed, that is sufficient
notice for an employer to be on notice.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, suppose --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does that subjective --
I'm sorry.  Does that subjective or -- is it even
relevant?  Meaning -- the issue is whether they failed
to hire her because of her religious practice.  Whether
the person thinks it is is the issue.  I mean, that's
why they acted.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's right, Your Honor.
And we think that's what makes this a particularly
straightforward case.  What the employer did here was
act upon the assumption that Ms. Elauf needed to wear
the headscarf for religious reasons, and yet that it
later claimed refuge that it didn't have sufficient
knowledge or certainty to actually have initiated the
accommodation process that Congress wanted in Section
2000e-2.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But getting back to
Justice Scalia's question, I think there's some
substantial force to your argument that the employee
doesn't have to mention this first.
But why -- why do we -- import the term
understand instead of know.  In a treatment case, the
whole idea is that -- that prohibited action was taken
because of religion.  It's what you knew.  Why -- why
are you making it so confusing?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I -- with
respect to -- it's our position it's the Tenth Circuit
that's made it confusing.  What the Tenth Circuit has
done is said when you know --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your position -- your
statement that you opened with is -- is that he must
understand.  You stay away from the word "know".  And
Justice Scalia asked you what -- why you did that, and I
can't understand your answer.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So the answer, Your Honor,
is we think that there is sufficient knowledge, notice,
when somebody understands that -- when somebody assumes
that a practice is religious and then acts upon it, that
that is sufficient.
What the Tenth Circuit said was that is not
sufficient, that what is needed is something more
approaching certainty.  If that's not --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Gershengorn, I
mean, so that does raise the question if yours is less
than certainty, how much less than certainty is it?  I
mean, suppose I'm an employer, and I say, you know, I
don't honestly know, I think.  You know, it's two out of
three.  Is that sufficient?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I think
that if I could explain how these cases come up, I think
it will -- the best way to answer your -- it would be
the best way to answer your question.
The answer is, in a situation like this in
which it's an applicant applying for a -- a position,
and the employer suspects, thinks, two-thirds, that
there's a religious problem -- the -- a religious
conflict, the employer has two options.  It can assume
there is no conflict, in which case they -- they make
the hiring decision on the merits.  In that case here,
Ms. Elauf would have been hired.
Alternatively, if the employer feels like
there's enough concern to -- about how Ms. Elauf would
be able to perform, they can raise -- start a dialogue.
That's what -- what Congress intended.  What they can't
do is what they did here and assume through a stereotype
that there was going to be a need for accommodation, and
then say, having assumed that, I don't have any
obligation to actually try to accommodate that.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that true even if it's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  You're
promoting --
Go ahead.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that true even if it's
under 50 percent?  In other words, say that employer
says, you know, I really don't know, but I think
there's, like, a 50/50 chance or even a 40 percent
chance that this person has a religious -- that -- has
religious -- that this practice is religious.  And I
don't really feel like getting into all this
accommodation stuff, so I'm not going to hire this
person.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So I think, Your Honor,
that that's what they cannot do.  But I do think --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So it doesn't really depend
on what the percentage chance is.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So I think --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It could be certain, it
could be less than certain, it could be a lot less than
certain, as long as the employer says there's some
chance, and I'm not going to hire, or promote, or fire,
or whatever, because of that chance.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I -- I
would like to try to separate out two different -- two
different situations that a -- could arise, only one of
which we think arises commonly.  One is that the
employer has a work rule and is concerned that the
applicant before it won't be able to comply in the
future with the -- after being hired, with the work
rule, because they perceive that the person is
religious.
I think the dilemma that Your Honor is
posing is really a false one there.  If the employer
really has a very small in -- understanding or thinks
there's -- it's very unlikely that the employee would be
religious, the right thing for the employer to do is to
assume that there's isn't a religious problem, to not
engage in the stereotyping and assume that the person
could comply as they would with somebody who was wearing
a headscarf or something else for not religious reasons.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure I
understand why you're fighting Justice Kagan's question.
Isn't the issue the reason that they acted?
They refused to hire someone because they had a
1 percent belief that they had a religious -- pardon the
pun -- a religious belief that they wouldn't
accommodate?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I don't
intend to fight Justice Kagan's hypothetical, and on the
facts of this case, I think it's really quite easy.  But
the reason why I'm trying to separate the two is because
I think the situation here is the easy case, and I'll
get to why the hard case and why I'm sort of fighting
Justice Kagan.
JUSTICE SCALIA:
confusing me enormously.
MR. GERSHENGORN:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
is you want.
MR. GERSHENGORN:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
You -- you're -- you're
Okay.
Would you tell me what it
I want --
You just say he
understands.  That doesn't do anything for me.  What he
understands, knows, believes, suspects.  What -- what
other -- what other verbs do you need?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, the test
that the courts of appeals have adopted for more than
two decades, which is the test that we ask this Court to
adopt, is that the employer needs sufficient information
from any source about the employee -- about the
applicant's religious needs --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  -- to permit the employer
to understand the existence of a conflict.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  To understand --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's the test that the
courts of appeals have been --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't care --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  -- for two decades.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- what they've used.  That
doesn't make any sense to me.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  But, Your Honor, the
reason why I think it makes sense in this case is
because if it's sufficient knowledge for you to actually
act upon it -- remember, if they -- if -- the critical
point here for us is if they had not -- if the employer
had not assumed that this was religious, had not
believed it, they would have hired her.  The default
rule for "I'm not sure," is hire.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Gershengorn,
didn't --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  What --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- she -- the person --
the first-line hire, person responsible for hiring,
didn't she say to the district manager, I think she's
wearing this headscarf for religious reasons, and that's
why I'm checking it out with you.  The answer she got
back was, it doesn't matter whether it's for religious
reasons.  We don't -- we don't accommodate people who
wear headscarfs.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's right, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So -- so it seems that
the -- the district manager is -- his point of view is
headscarfs are out.  This particular woman was wearing
one for religious reasons, but it doesn't matter what
reason, we don't accommodate headscarfs.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  I think that's right, Your
Honor, and that's exactly what Congress said when it
enacted these provisions.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, it didn't.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  They didn't want to
happen --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There is no law against
such a rule.  Any employer can have a rule, We don't
allow headscarfs.  And until someone applies for a job
who, for a religious reason, wants to wear a headscarf
and the employer knows that it's for a religious reason
or suspects, or believes, or understands, or whatever
verbs you want to use, there's been no violation of the
law.  You can -- you can have that rule.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Absolutely, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We don't allow our
employees to wear headscarfs.  Nothing wrong with that
rule.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's correct, Your
Honor.  But once --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the mere fact that
this -- this supervisor said that doesn't prove a
violation by the employer.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Well, I don't agree with
that, Your Honor.  I think once the -- it's clear that
the employee is -- needs an accommodation of that rule,
that's exactly what Title VII requires.  That's what the
Court addressed in Hardison.  It was a neutral rule that
you had to work on the Sabbath, but what the court
said --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right, but that
supervisor did not have that knowledge.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Oh, no, Your Honor.
That's not correct.  The -- and I took from Justice
Ginsburg's hypothetical -- question that -- that what we
believe to be the case, that Cooke conferred -- conveyed
to her supervisor, Johnson, that it was for a religious
reason.  There's a dispute of the -- in testimony about
this, but what Cooke said -- and remember summary
judgment has now been granted against us, so the
evidence read in our favor -- what Cooke said was, I
told Johnson that it was for religious reasons, and
Johnson said, if we allow this then someone will paint
themselves green and call it a religion.  We can't allow
it.
So the court decides the question on the
assumption that the decision-makers knew --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, your -- your
solution that you suggested is that if there's some
doubt the employer should begin a dialogue, I think is
what you -- but I think that may promote stereotypes to
a far greater degree than what you're objecting to.
Let's say you have someone of Middle Eastern
appearance who shows up for the interview with a beard.
And the employer, like Abercrombie & Fitch, they don't
like beards.  They don't want their models, as they call
them, having beards.  But he doesn't know if the beard
is there for a  religious reason or not.
So you think it's better to him to sit there
and start asking this applicant questions he would not
ask anyone else about religion?  Why are you wearing a
beard?  Is there some religious reason for that?  It
seems that your solution causes more problems.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I have two
responses that I'd like to say.  First, I -- I don't
think it's right that the solution causes more problems
because I don't think that what Congress would have
preferred is that the person not get hired than that the
dialogue be begun.  If those are the two options, I
think it's clear Congress wanted an accommodation of the
religious practice.
But I also think that Your Honor's
hypothetical points out quite nicely the -- that it's
somewhat -- it's a somewhat artificial situation here.
What the employer is saying is, I don't want a beard
when the person is on the floor.  But that's not a
reason not to hire someone who walks in the door with a
beard.  The New York Yankees, for example, have for
decades had a no facial hair policy, but they don't not
pursue free agents that wear beards.  They assume that
those free agents can -- can shave once they get to the
Yankees.  It's the same --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, is it
reasonable for an employer to say, look, I don't want to
buy into some problem with a guy who has a beard.  I'm
going to say can you shave it?  He's going to say no or
he's only going to shave twice a week.
I mean, isn't he reasonably going to say --
let's say, I don't care if it's religious -- a religious
reason or not.  The guy shows up with a beard.  I'm not
going to hire him.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, that's the
hard question that I think Justice Kagan was asking, and
I do think that's a trickier question.
If your policy is not I have a work rule
that I'm concerned you won't be able to comply with in
the future, then I think, for all the reasons I've said
thus far, it's all said.
If the question is when someone comes to my
office with a beard and I just think they're -- it's
unkempt, I don't like it, I'm not going to hire them
regardless of whether they could comply, I think that's
the situation that presents this, is it one-third, is it
two-thirds.  I think that's a hard question.  It's not
the one presented here.  And, quite candidly, it's not
the kinds of cases that we actually see.  They much more
are the work rule.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You could avoid those hard
questions, whether it's understand, believe, suspect, by
adopting the rule that the court of appeals adopted
here; and that is, if you want to sue me for denying you
a job for a religious reason, the burden is on you to
say, I'm wearing the headscarf for a religious reason,
or I'm wearing the beard for a religious reason.
That -- that avoids all problems.  Once you notify the
employer that it's for a religious reason, you got 'em.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did the employer tell
her -- did the employer tell her that it had this Look
Policy --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  And so that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- that a headscarf would
violate?  How could she ask for something when she
didn't know the employer had such a rule?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's exactly the
problem, Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia, in
response to your question.  The reason that's
insufficient is that it is simply not the case that
Respondent -- as Respondent suggests that the superior
knowledge is with the applicant in that situation.  The
applicant is not on notice of what the work rules are.
And, indeed, in this situation, the testimony was
uncontroverted that Ms. Elauf did not know there was a
Look Policy that prohibited the headscarf.  And so --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, wait a minute.  This
is not the place to get into the facts.  But I -- I
thought her friend told her to wear at least a colored
scarf, so the subject came up.  So I -- I --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  But -- but actually,
Justice Kennedy, that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Again, we're -- we're not
factfinders here.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  No, I understand.  But
it's -- it's important, Your Honor, because actually
that, in fact, supports our position because what the --
what her friend said was, there's no problem with a
headscarf, it just shouldn't be black.  And so she then
wore -- if anything, she was on notice that there was no
problem with the headscarf.  So I actually think it cuts
exactly the other way.
And, Justice Ginsburg, to pick up on your
point, what makes it particularly inappropriate, I
think, to put the burden on the applicant here is that
it's the employer who gets to structure the interview.
And, in fact, the employer here read some version of the
Look Policy, but did not mention the headscarfs.
So, actually, this was a situation in which
the employer itself could have put Elauf on notice, and
then it's a very different situation.  If the employer
says, we don't allow headscarfs, and then -- and then
the employee doesn't say anything, I think that's a very
different situation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  To get --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  But --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  To get back to my
beard case, is there -- if it's someone with a Middle
Eastern appearance with a beard, you want the employer to
begin some kind of a dialogue.  If it's somebody who's not
Middle Eastern and has a beard, can the employer assume,
well, I don't think that's for religious reasons?
In other words, he's going to be asking
religious questions of some people based on a
stereotype, but not others.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why -- why does he have
to ask about religious beliefs?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could you answer my
question, please?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Sure, Your Honor.
Although part of the answer is that I don't think
they -- that the employer does.  As I've said earlier,
the right approach for the employer who really wants to
avoid the subject is to assume that the person of Middle
Eastern descent, just like the person not of Middle
Eastern descent, has a beard for personal preference and
would be happy to shave if he got the job in order to
comply with the work rules.
And that is what is critical for it.  That
is what Congress wanted to accomplish here.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why can't the
employer just simply say, we have a Look Policy that
doesn't permit beards.  Can you comply with that policy?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Absolutely, Your Honor.
That -- those --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's all they have
to -- they don't have to ask about reasons or no
reasons.  It doesn't really matter why.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Right.  As I tried --
there are two options.  One is the one I gave to the
Chief Justice, which is you can assume the person
doesn't wear it for religious reasons and then hire
them; or if you're concerned about it, you can ask a
specific question.  The EEOC has made clear that that
is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The question is
supposed -- the question is supposed to be why are you
wearing a beard?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  No.  The question is, we
have a work rule that prohibits facial hair on the
floor, on the force, on the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that doesn't
cover anything that's not immediately apparent --
apparent by the appearance.  You make -- they can have a
code of conduct that presumably would go through several
pages, here are all the things we require.  Any problem
with any of them?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I actually
think that that -- this is a protect -- that their --
the employer is at no risk of liability if he asks no
questions but makes no assumptions and stereotypes.  And
that's why I don't think what Your Honor's hypothesizing
turns out to be a problem in practice.
What is going on is that in the mine-run of
cases that the EEOC brings at the depth we see in these
cases is you're talking about a work rule.  You're
talking about you must wear pants at work, and the
employer has a religious objection, thinks women should
wear skirts.  You're talking about a no long hair
policy.  You're -- you're talking about groom and garb.
And the concern is will you be able to comply in the
future.
The employer doesn't have to run down those
questions.  The employer can assume there's no religious
problem, can avoid the stereotyping.  However, if the
employer wishes, what the Court said in Ansonia is that
a bilateral dialogue is what Title VII is designed to
accomplish.
And so picking up on Justice Sotomayor's
point, you could raise the policy.  And this is not a
crazy idea.  This is what --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could -- could I --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  -- Respondent did.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand.  Could --
could I ask you -- he can ask can you do it?  Is -- is
that the only religious preference that has to be
honored?  I can, but, you know, really, I would like not
to for a religious reason.  I -- I guess I could take off
my headscarf or whatnot, but it would be very
inappropriate, religiously uncomfortable.
Is -- is that a --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are -- are you
acknowledging that -- that the only accommodation that
has to be made is an accommodation for somebody who
absolutely for a religious reason cannot do something?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't think so.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  But that is not what this
case is about.  What -- because the question --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you can't ask that.
You -- you cannot ask the question --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- you're telling them to
ask, can you do it?  Well, yes, I guess I could, but --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  But that's the exact
dialogue that's supposed to happen.  What this -- that's
what this Court said should happen.  That's the
bilateral dialogue.
What Congress wanted when it passed a
reasonable accommodation requirement is precisely for
the employer and the employee or the employee not to
have to do anything.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So she says, yes, I could.
And later says, yeah, I could, but -- but, boy, it is
really uncomfortable for me to do that for religious
reasons.  Would she still have a lawsuit?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Well, she wouldn't have a
lawsuit, but she might be able to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All she said was, yes, I
could.  She could.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Well, if she could, then
she was hired.  Then when she says, actually, now it's
quite uncomfortable, that's a request for an
accommodation, and she and the employer need to go into
a discussion, just like you would if you said, I need
this -- I need this time off to attend a religious
conversion ceremony, which was at issue in the Ninth
Circuit case in Heller.  That's just the back-and-forth
of everyday employer-employee relations.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, couldn't the employer
say, we have a policy no beards, or whatever, do you
have any problem with that?  Why do you have to -- why
does it have to be phrased, could you do it?  Just say,
do you have any problem with that?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  I think that's another way
to phrase it.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you willing to do it?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  It's -- it's a matter -- I
think what the -- what -- what Title VII is about, what
this Court has recognized and what certainly the EEOC
has recognized is the actual accommodation back and
forth is quite a flexible process.  It's designed to be
collaborative.  And so there isn't a fixed rule you have
to phrase it this way or phrase it that way.
I think the point is to initiate the
dialogue.  And I think had that happened here, then --
then we would be talking about a different point in the
process about whether there was a reasonable
accommodation that could be done and whether it could be
done without undue hardship.  But that dialogue never
happened here, and that is the problem with the case as
we see it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  And the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Respondent says that
you switched theories in midstream, that you started out
with a refusal to accommodate theory and then you
abandoned that.  Is that --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That is not correct --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- not so?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  -- Justice Ginsburg.  From
the very beginning, our theory has been that the
Respondent violated Title VII by refusing to accommodate
Ms. Elauf.  That was the theory that was presented in
the complaint.  It's the theory we got summary judgment
and damages on.  It's the theory we defended in the
court of appeals.  And it's the -- it's the theory we
have -- we have proceeded under on all of our cases
here.  There has been no switch.  The phrase "religious
accommodation" appears 14 times in our --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So that -- that's
disparate treatment plus failure to accommodate,
correct?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So they have seized on the
word "disparate treatment."
I'd like to -- if I can avoid a yes/no and
just explain our position on disparate treatment,
Justice Kennedy.
The brief -- the phrase used in the brief
was that a failure to accommodate is -- is the kind of
disparate treatment that Title VII was designed to
prevent.  We think that is correct and accurate, that
what the Congress meant to do was put people who needed
an accommodation like Ms. Elauf, a headscarf
accommodation, on the same footing as people who did not
need to wear a head -- headgear.  That is the sense in
which we -- this is disparate treatment.
However, we recognize that the EEOC and the
lower courts have used disparate treatment in another
way, which is to say there's a disparate treatment way
to prove discrimination, a failure to accommodate
theory.
We did not and -- and to highlight the
difference, a disparate treatment would be you allow all
hats, but not religious hats.  That's disparate
treatment.  This is you don't -- you don't allow any
hats, but we want to wear a religious hat.  That would
be a failure to accommodate.  We did not, at any point
in this case, abandon or change our theory from the
failure to accommodate.
What the other side has done is assert not
only that we did that, but we did it for some motive,
because we wished to avoid a 1981a question, a case -- a
question which a -- no court has ever adopted their
theory and which at no point in this litigation have
they ever raised, even though 1981a was the only theory
on which we could get damages in the district court.  We
had a damages trial and 1981a was the only source of
damages.  They never raised it.  Our pretrial brief said
we're proceeding under 1981a.  The district court's
pretrial order listed 1981a.  That was the basis of
our damages.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Again, I'm a
little confused.  I didn't know -- I -- I read your
complaint, and it says, "The Respondent refused to hire
Ms. Elauf because she wears a hijab and further failed
to accommodate her religious belief by making an
exception to the Look Policy."
I looked at your briefs, I looked at the
jury charge; and it seems like the two were always tied.
The failure to hire was because they refused to
accommodate her.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's correct, Your
Honor.  And that has been our theory from the very
beginning.  So the idea that 1981a magically became part
of this case when we mentioned the word "disparate
treatment" in our opening brief is just not credible.
That has been the theory.  They -- they -- that's how
the damages were done.  They never raised it on appeal.
They never raised it in the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, suppose they had.
Their argument is that you get damages only for
intentional.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your -- Your Honor, no
court has ever addressed that, but our position is --
and this is how the courts have uniformly applied it --
that this is intentional discrimination under 1981a,
although it's not a question that's before this Court.
The reason for that is 1981a distinguishes between --
and this is -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.  It's in the red
brief on Page 1a, and it's 42 U.S.C. 1981a(a).  It
distinguishes between unlawful intentional
discrimination, not an employment practice that is
unlawful because of its disparate impact.  The failure
to accommodate claim is neither disparate -- is not a
disparate impact claim, and it is intentional
discrimination for exactly the reason that Justice
Sotomayor has said.  It's the intentional refusal to
hire because of a religious practice that you could
reasonably accommodate.  And this is not as the amicus
brief -- some of the amicus briefs have suggested, just
a disparate impact claim.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm -- I'm sorry to be
obtuse.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't know why you just
don't concede that that's a form of disparate --
disparate treatment.  Failure to accommodate is a form
of disparate treatment.  I don't accommodate you because
of your religion.  Disparate treatment.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I -- as I
tried to suggest --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You know what?  I --
I'm -- I'm just --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  -- I think it is a form
of --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- missing something.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  -- disparate treatment as
we've used it in the Act.  I just want to distinguish
the different theories, because under a disparate
treatment approach, there -- there's a -- as the lower
courts have used it, you would have to show that it was
because of the religious nature of the practice that you
didn't accommodate.
So, for example, again, that I allow hats
for everyone, but not if you have a religious hat.  That
would be a -- as the lower courts have called -- a
conventional disparate treatment claim.
If I could reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Dvoretzky.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR.  DVORETZKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court;
The premise of the EEOC's argument today, as
I understand it, is that Abercrombie acted because of
the religious basis for Ms. Elauf's headscarf.
That is not correct as a factual matter; and
the EEOC's theory, in its brief, does not depend on any
such assumption.  The EEOC's theory in its brief is that
anytime an employer suspects a possible conflict or
correctly understands such a conflict, at that point it
is on notice and must offer a religious accommodation.
And so if you imagine a situation, which is
not at all --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They don't have to offer
a religious accommodation if they have a reasonable
basis not to.  I mean, you follow the statute.  You only
have to accommodate if it's not an undue burden.
MR. DVORETZKY:  That -- that's true, they
always have the undue burden defense; but absent an
undue burden, they must accommodate and they must depart
from a religion-neutral policy based on a mere suspicion
of a possible conflict.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  It's not an un- --
we go back to their position.
MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's very simple,
because you're mischaracterizing it.  Their position is,
if you believe that someone -- believe, know -- we're --
a lot of adjectives -- that someone will need a
religious accommodation, then -- and won't comply with
your policy, just ask them, do you have a -- just the
way Justice Alito said.  You know, we don't permit
facial hair on the floor.  You have a problem with that?
MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Sotomayor, as -- as
an initial matter, their theory in their brief does not
depend on any sort of assumption about whether the
applicant would later be able to comply with the work
rule or not.
Under the theory expressed in their brief,
even if an employer like Abercrombie had a policy in
which the Look Policy applied at the interview, you are
being assessed at the interview based on your compliance
with our dress --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that the -- do
you think that the employee has to say, I am dressed the
way I am for a religious reason?
MR. DVORETZKY:  Not necessarily.  However,
the employer's knowledge has to be traced to the
employee in some way.  In the typical case, that is
going to come directly from the employee because of the
individualized and personal nature of religion --
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Let's say
four -- four people show up for a job interview at
Abercrombie.
And half -- this is going to sound like a
joke, but, you know, it's not.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO:  So the first is a Sikh man
wearing a turban, the second is a Hasidic man wearing a
hat, the third is a Muslim woman wearing a niqab, the
fourth is a Catholic nun in a habit.
Now, do you think the employer has to --
that those people have to say, we just want to tell you,
we're dressed this way for a religious reason.  We're
not just trying to make a fashion statement.
MR. DVORETZKY:  First of all, Your Honor,
one aspect of your hypothetical is not a joke; and that
is, that many of these interviews at Abercrombie are, in
fact, group interviews.  And I think --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are the what?  Group?
MR. DVORETZKY:  Group -- group interviews
where there are mul- -- multiple applicants at a time.
And so I think the reality is, it's a lot
more difficult than the government imagines to start
having these individualized dialogues.
But going to your point about those sorts
of religious outfits, one can certainly imagine cases
in which it is more obvious than others that a
particular -- a particular garb is likely worn for
religious purposes.
However, I would direct the Court, if I
could, to Joint Appendix 130 and 131, which contain
pictures of the sort of headscarf that Ms. Elauf was
actually wearing in this case.
Those sorts of situations where it's far
more ambiguous whether a -- whether a particular outward
symbol is religious in nature or not will be far more
common.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that can be the case,
but I want to know the answer to the question whether
the employee has to say, I'm wearing this for a
religious reason, or whether you're willing to admit
that there are at least some circumstances in which the
employer is charged with that knowledge based on what
the employer observes.
MR. DVORETZKY:  No, Your Honor.  I think
there are some circumstances in which it is certainly
more likely than others, but the question before the
Court is to devise a rule that's going to apply across
the board.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Actually, I didn't think
that was the question.  I thought the question presented
was that the Tenth Circuit had said, Employer, unless
you know from the woman who is applying, from the
applicant, unless you receive direct, explicit notice
that what she wants to wear is based on religion and she
wants an accommodation, unless you receive direct,
explicit notice from her, you're home free to do what
you want.
Now, in their question presented, they say,
in the last few words in describing it, we think that's
wrong.
Now, I agree that we have to say whether
that's wrong and, if it is wrong, it would be helpful to
say what they have to do.  So the SG says, here is what
it is.  If the employer correctly infers, correctly
understands, and I would add "or correctly believes"
that a practice is religious and an accommodation is
necessary, that's it.  Then he has to accommodate unless
he has one of the excuses under the statute, et cetera.
Okay.  What's wrong with that?
MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Breyer, I think
what you've just described is a rule for all cases and
it's one that is entirely unadministrable for courts,
employers, and applicants alike.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It is -- it is
unadministrable to say that if the employer believes,
thinks, this woman is religious and needs an
accommodation and he's right, well, do something unless
you have an excuse.
What -- why is that unadministrable?
MR. DVORETZKY:  Your Honor, I believe that's
unadministrable because the EEOC does not explain what
level of certainty is required for a belief versus
suspecting --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh no, you have to prove.
This -- this is correct.  You have to prove he has a
belief.  Now, we probably in 250,000 Federal cases a
year, of those, say, 80,000 that go to trial.  Proving
that somebody has a belief or other is probably at issue
in 90 percent of them.  Now, I'm making that up, that
number, but nonetheless, I don't think it's uncommon in
the law that you have to prove that somebody believes
something.  So we say, the standard of proving belief is
like in any other case.
MR. DVORETZKY:  I don't think this is like
any other case, because you're dealing with -- you're
dealing with something -- religious belief, which is
inherently personal to the individual.  And to charge
employers with -- to charge employers with Title VII
liability and require them to come to an understanding
of whether a particular practice is religious or not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is -- this is such
--
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, Mr. Dvoretzky, suppose
an employer just doesn't want to hire any Jews, and
somebody walks in and his name is Noah Goldberg, and he
looks kind of Jewish and the employer doesn't know he's
Jewish.  No absolute certainty and certainly
Mr. Goldberg doesn't say anything about being Jewish,
but the employer just operates on an assumption that
he's Jewish, so no, he doesn't get the job.  Is that a
violation?
MR. DVORETZKY:  That is a disparate
treatment violation of Title VII.  But the employer --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  That has got to be against
the law, right?  It doesn't matter whether the employer
--
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It doesn't matter whether
the employer knows it to an absolute certainty, right?
MR. DVORETZKY:  Absolutely, because in that
situation, because what's relevant is the employer's
intent.  If the employer intends to discriminate on the
basis of religion, then that's a Title VII violation.
What's going on here, however, is that the employer
seeks to apply a religion-neutral dress code.  Religion,
according to Johnson --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Except in Title VII, you
would be right if all that Title VII did was prevent
religious discrimination, but it makes a religious
practice, a refusal to accommodate a religious practice
is itself a violation of Title VII.
So we have -- it's -- and that was done
deliberately, was it not, so that religious practices
would have to be accommodated.
MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes, Your Honor, and two
points in response to that, if I may.  One, we're not
contending that religious practices don't have to be
accommodated.  What we are contending as an initial
matter is that an employer does not intentionally
discriminate on the basis of a religious practice by
enforcing a religion-neutral dress code that would have
been have been enforced --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the thing about my
question was, is that what this statute does is to say
that if you are, in fact, wearing a headscarf for
religious reasons, that your neutral policy really
doesn't matter, it only matters if you -- if there's an
undue burden and you really can't make an accommodation,
but except for that, it really doesn't matter.  You just
have to hire me, even if I'm wearing a headscarf.  And
so the fact that you don't know that I'm wearing a
headscarf for religious reasons, that you only kind of
assume that, because most people do wear headscarves for
religious reasons, it shouldn't make any more difference
than in the hypothetical that I gave.
MR. DVORETZKY:  Your Honor, on -- on that
logic, it also would make no difference if the employer
had absolutely no idea that the headscarf was worn for
religious reasons, because it would still be a religious
headscarf and a religious practice.  Not even the EEOC
is claiming that there's a duty to accommodate in that
situation.  And so the question before the Court is, at
what level of knowledge does the employer have to have
before the duty to accommodate is triggered.  For 40
years, the EEOC's own guidance has put the burden to
initiate the conversation on the employee because only
the employee knows.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's if the employee
knows the rule.  But here the employee had no reason to
think that there was anything offensive about her dress.
How can she say, by the way, I have a religious reason
for wearing this headscarf, when from everything, from
all appearances, the employer doesn't care.  It's okay
to wear a headscarf.  Then the employer has not given
her notice of this Look Policy, so how is she supposed
to in -- in -- intrude the question, that as far as all
appearances go, it's fine, that she's wearing a
headscarf.  There's no Look Policy that the employee
knows that's violated.
MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Ginsburg, I
respectfully disagree with that characterization of what
went on here.  Ms. Elauf knew enough about Abercrombie
to understand that it had a dress code.  Knew enough
about Abercrombie to un -- to ask in advance.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did she testify that she
knew they had a dress code?  I was not aware of that.
MR. DVORETZKY:  She -- she testified that
she knew that she would have to wear Abercrombie style
clothes, that's Joint Appendix 23.  She knew that
Abercrombie did not sell headscarves.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But she did.  In fact,
she came in with an Abercrombie type shirt, right?
MR. DVORETZKY:  She did.  But she also knew
that Abercrombie did not sell headscarves.  That's at
Joint Appendix 37-38.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But she asked a friend,
who worked for Abercrombie whether the -- whether the
headscarf was a problem, and the friend said, no, if
it's not black, it should be okay.  And in fact, three
of the four managers said it was okay to wear scarves,
so --
MR. DVORETZKY:  It -- but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- why would she suspect
that if she is qualified and has the personality they're
looking for, and is dressed appropriately, that this
company would fail to hire her because they refused to
accommodate her religious belief.
MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Sotomayor, she asked
a friend who in turn asked another Abercrombie employee,
who was not involved in the hiring process.  And even
the advice that was --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I think it was a
store manager.
MR. DVORETZKY:  But a store manager who was
not involved in this hiring process.  She had an
opportunity before Ms. Cooke, who interviewed her, to
ask any questions about the Look Policy, after Ms. Cooke
described the Look Policy at the interview.  So --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  She did not mention the
headscarf?
MR. DVORETZKY:  Did not mention the
headscarf.  These Abercrombie interviews, in addition to
being group interviews, are scripted interviews in which
--
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Show me where in the
script.  Because I remember reading this, and she, in
fact, said we don't discuss the Look Policy at the
interview.
MR. DVORETZKY:  If you look at Joint
Appendix 33 and Joint Appendix 100 to 101, that's
Cooke's testimony, that she read a summary of the Look
Policy and gave Ms. Elauf the opportunity to ask any
questions.  Now --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Okay, but there was no
mention of a headscarf in what she read.
MR. DVORETZKY:  It did not specifically
mention the headscarf.  However, it described the Look
Policy in general.  Ms. Elauf knew before, it was a
matter of common sense that Abercrombie requires their
employees to wear clothes that look like Abercrombie
style.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So let's say that somebody
comes in for an interview and this person is -- has the
look, if you wanted to, you know, draw the person who
has the look, this is the person who has the look, looks
just like this mythical preppy or --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- somebody who came off the
beach in California.  Only one problem, the person is
wearing a black blouse, which is against the Abercrombie
rules.  Now, would Abercrombie fire that -- or would not
hire that person on the assumption that this person
likes black so much this person is going to wear black
every single day?
MR. DVORETZKY:  I don't think Abercrombie
needs to make that assumption about what the person will
do later in order to make a judgment based on the
person's appearance at the interview.  If I walked into
an Abercrombie interview wearing a suit, presumably
Abercrombie could tell me when you come to work, please
don't wear the suit, please wear our clothes.  But it
would also be equally rational for Abercrombie to say,
you know, if this person is coming in wearing a suit,
that's not compatible with our style.  And likewise for
the headscarf.  Johnson's testimony, which the EEOC
didn't challenge, is that he would have taken the same
action for somebody who came into an interview wearing a
headscarf, a baseball cap, a helmet or another religious
symbol.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Or a yarmulke.  He said
specifically, somebody come in, applies for a job, wears
a yarmulke , no questions asked, that violates our policy.
That was his testimony.
MR. DVORETZKY:  That's right, and what that
shows is that religion is not the basis for the action
here, rather, Abercrombie at most was completely
indifferent to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but that doesn't
work in a case like this.  It's not a question, are you
treating everybody the same.  You have an obligation to
accommodate people with particular religious practice or
beliefs, so to keep constantly saying, oh, we would have
treated somebody with a baseball cap the same way
doesn't seem to me is very responsive.
MR. DVORETZKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, for
purposes of an intentional discrimination claim, it does
matter that you would treat everybody the same, and
that's the theory the EEOC is pursuing here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, no, but as I
understand it, it's intentional discrimination because
you failed to accommodate.
MR. DVORETZKY:  And I would submit that that
is an incomprehensible understanding of what intentional
discrimination means.  Intentional discrimination --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Again, how we get into all
that, if you want to add something to it, it seems we're
in a kind of minutia.  What's wrong with saying if he
correctly believes that she's religious and needs
accommodation, fine, that's the end of it.  You're in
the statute and prove an excuse.  Correct belief can
arise in a thousand contexts.  Did he correctly believe
that the drug that was being sold, that white powder,
was heroin?  Did the manager whom you're trying to fire
and is saying you did, did he correctly believe that, in
fact -- or didn't pay enough for college graduates?  Did
he correctly believe that this applicant graduated from
Princeton?  Did he -- that's Abercrombie -- did he
correctly believe that -- that he had authority under
the -- under the delegation of agency, to sign a check?
I mean, look, there are thousands of things.
What's -- why is it our job here to say what the right
way of proving correct belief is?  I mean, I think, we
can say it's something wrong.  You don't have to
formulate your correct belief just because she told you.
I mean, you can argue that one.  That's the only way to
prove it and I'm open to that argument, I'd like to hear
it.
But once we're beyond that, if I'm right
that that isn't the only way you can prove correct
belief, why do we have to say?
MR. DVORETZKY:  Because, Your Honor, in this
particular context, having a standard like correct
belief or suspecting a possible conflict will inevitably
lead employers --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm with you with
"suspect."
MR. DVORETZKY:  That is -- suspect --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm with you only where
they correctly believe that, dah, dah, dah, or
understand dah, dah, dah, or no.  Those three things
seem good enough to me.
Now, I've repeated this three times, but I
want to hear the answer why they're not good enough.
MR. DVORETZKY:  The -- the reason they're
not -- Justice Breyer, the reason that they're not good
enough is that there is no way that the employer can
know about a religious practice unless it either --
unless it is -- that information is traceable to the
employee.  And having that kind of a correct belief
standard will inevitably lead employers to stereotype,
because a fact-finder might later find that they short
--
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, isn't that --
isn't that what Ms. Cooke says she did?  She said she
saw her in a scarf and that she assumed that it was worn
because of religious beliefs, so she acted on a
stereotype that some, I guess, if you wear a black
scarf, it's because of a religious belief.
MR. DVORETZKY:  Your Honor, I don't believe
that she acted on that stereotype.  I believe that
Johnson instructed her not to hire Ms. Elauf because she
was not compliant with the Look Policy.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, he hired her because
-- didn't hire her because, under the Look Policy, he
believed you could not accommodate that religious
belief.
MR. DVORETZKY:  I think the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or that religious
practice.
MR. DVORETZKY:  I think the reason that he
didn't hire her, Joint Appendix 134, is that she simply
was not compliant with the Look Policy.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So -- so the
traceable -- now you've got me sort of interested in
this -- it seems to me, when you mean traceable to the
woman, I mean, you mean it loosely, I guess.
MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's pretty hard to think
of a case where it wouldn't be.  I mean, I guess I could
imagine a case that he found out about this woman from
an FBI agent who was making it up.  But, I mean, that
just seems very, very unlikely.
MR. DVORETZKY:  The case that the government
gives as an example is one in which an employer learned
of an applicant's religious practice from the
employer's -- from the applicant's reference who was --
the applicant's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And the applicant's
reference didn't know the applicant?
MR. DVORETZKY:
did know the applicant?
JUSTICE BREYER:
traceable to the --
MR. DVORETZKY:
The applicant's reference
Okay.  There it is,
And so that is traceable to
the -- to the applicant.  But the problem with -- the
problem would be --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the difference in
your -- I mean, I'm a little -- I'm still very confused.
You don't think that there could ever be discrimination
based on a general neutral policy, because what does it
matter if she told him that this was because of
religious belief?  If he's only firing her or not hiring
her because of the Look Policy, then he hasn't
discriminated.
MR. DVORETZKY:  No, Your Honor.  If she had
told him, this is for religious belief and I need an
accommodation from the Look Policy, at that point, under
the statute, there would be a duty to accommodate.  But
the question here is do we want to put --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I am so totally
confused.  So he hears it from Ms. Cooke and that's not
enough?
MR. DVORETZKY:  That's right.  Because
Ms. Cooke herself testified that she did not know that
Ms. Elauf wore the headscarf for religious reasons.
What we want to avoid is a rule that leads employers, in
order to avoid liability, to start stereotyping about
whether they think, guess or suspect that somebody is
doing something for religious reasons.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We've already gone
through this.  All I have to do is say, This is what our
Look Policy is, do you have any problem with it?  As
Justice Alito pointed out a while back, don't have to
probe anything about religion.  I thought Ms. -- what is
his name, Johnson -- when he said, I would do the same
thing with a man who came in with a yarmulke .  So the man
who came in with the yarmulke  got the same treatment.
Sorry, I was, I was -- Ms. Cooke, I would want to hire
you, but I can't.  That was the answer that he gave.  So
there's no difference between the headscarf or yarmulke
or a Sikh turban in Mr. Johnson's view.
MR. DVORETZKY:  That -- that's right.  And
to answer your question about why the employer can't
just disclose the policy, that isn't a solution, because
that is asking employers to treat applicants differently
based on stereotypes or assumption about whether
something is likely a religious practice.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If it's going to be a
requirement for the job, then doesn't the employer have
an obligation to tell the employee what the job
requirements are?
MR. DVORETZKY:  No, Your Honor, not under
Title VII.  Title VII is not a Civil Service statute
that requires applicants or employees who violate
workplace rules to be given a chance to explain
themselves and told all of the requirements before
adverse action is taken against them.
JUSTICE ALITO:  This is what I don't
understand about your position with respect to this
particular case.  As I understand it, Abercrombie does
not have a policy that the -- that an interviewee must
comply with the Look Policy; is that correct?
MR. DVORETZKY:  The Look Policy itself does
not apply at the interview.  It seems that Mr. --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So what -- on -- there would
be no reason for not hiring the individual involved here
unless you assumed that she was going to wear a scarf
every day.  Just because she wore a headscarf on that
one day, wouldn't mean that she necessarily was going to
wear it everyday.  Every day she might.  Maybe she's
just having a bad hair day so she comes in with a
headscarf, but she doesn't have any religious reason for
doing it.  Would you reject her for that?  No.  The
reason that she was rejected was because you assumed she
was going to do this every day and the only reason why
she would do it every day is because she had a religious
reason.
MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Alito, that has not
been the EEOC's theory of this case.  And if it had
been, there would have been ways that they could have
tried to prove that.  They could have questioned Johnson
specifically about that.  What would he have done if
somebody had come in wearing a ball cap?  They could
have tried to get comparative evidence about what would
happened when people came in wearing nonreligious head
wear.  And so the EEOC's theory, which it had every
opportunity to prove, has not been that Johnson --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why would they ask
anything about nonreligious?  Title VII doesn't require
accommodating baseball caps, but it does require
accommodating to religious practices.  So the employer
is not -- as I said before, it's not just, I can't
discriminate on the basis of religion, but if there's a
religious practice, I must accommodate it as a discrete
requirement.
MR. DVORETZKY:  The -- the premise of
Justice Alito's question, as I understood it, is that
Abercrombie only didn't hire this person because the
headscarf was religious.  And what I'm suggesting is,
Abercrombie might well not have hired anybody who walked
in wearing any head cover covering.  And so if the EEOC
had wanted to prove the role that assumptions about
religion supposedly --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So why would that be so
when you just said they don't require people at the
interview stage to conform to the Look Policy?
MR. DVORETZKY:  On its face, the Look Policy
itself does not require that.  But Johnson, the
decision maker here, in effect was judging people based
on --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You were about to tell us
what the EEOC's theory of the case was.  I was eager to
hear that.  Could you tell us what you think their
theory of the case was?
MR. DVORETZKY:  I think their theory of the
case was that there was a duty to accommodate a
religious practice anytime an employer has a correct
understanding or a suspicion of that practice.  It has
not -- the theory has not been that Abercrombie acted
based on assumptions about Ms. Elauf's religion.  And I
think one way in which we know that is, let's assume
that the Look Policy did apply at the interview.  Under
the EEOC's theory, if an interviewer suspected that the
applicant -- or correctly understood, as Justice Breyer
prefers -- correctly understood that the applicant wore
the headscarf for religious purposes, at that point,
there would be a duty to accommodate.
Regardless of whether Abercrombie did or did
not make any assumptions about future compliance, if the
Look Policy applied at the interview, there would be a
duty to accommodate upon that correct understanding at
the interview.
The problem with that rule is that
employers, in order to protect themselves in the future
from having a jury find that they must have correctly
understood that a particular --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's the difference
between that and having no --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what you
were about to say.  Would you finish your thought?
MR. DVORETZKY:  The only way that employers
can protect themselves under the EEOC's approach is by
training their managers to stereotype about possible
religious beliefs because a judge or jury might later
find that Abercrombie or an employer correctly
understood, or must have correctly understood, under an
objective test which they don't disclaim in their amici
briefs.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you're essentially
saying that the problem with the rule is that it
requires Abercrombie to engage in what might be thought
of as an awkward conversation, to ask some questions.
Now, people can disagree about whether one can ask those
questions in a way that's awkward at all, but you're
saying we should structure the whole legal system to
make sure that there is no possibility of that awkward
conversation ever taking place.  But the alternative to
that rule is a rule where Abercrombie just gets to say,
we're going to stereotype people and prevent them from
getting jobs.  We'll never have the awkward conversation
because we're just going to cut these people out and
make sure that they never become Abercrombie employees.
Now, between those two options, the option
of using a stereotype to make sure that somebody never
gets a job and using a stereotype to have an awkward
conversation, which does this statute seem to think is
the worst problem?
MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Kagan, the problem
is not having awkward conversations.  The problem is
that the EEOC's rule would lead employers to treat
people differently based on their religion, which is
precisely the opposite of what Title VII wants.  The --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They -- Title VII
requires them to treat people who have religious
practice differently.  They don't have to accommodate a
baseball cap.  They do have to accommodate a yarmulke.
MR. DVORETZKY:  But Title VII requires that
only after -- as the EEOC has said for 40 years -- only
after the employee or applicant places religion on the
table.  Title VII does not want employers to be making
those judgments before the employee raises the issue.
And the concern that the EEOC raises here, that we're
going to have applicants who are completely in the dark
about work policies, has not been borne out by any --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I got you.  Is this
right?  I've got, I think, your argument.  Your argument
is it may sound odd to want a special rule as to when
you have belief or so forth, but for administrative
reasons, we have to have it.  There are millions of
people who are practicing one religion or another where
you get a clue of that from their name or maybe their
dress or whatever it is.  And whenever we have such a
person applying, if she doesn't say anything or he
doesn't say anything, and we don't hire them or we don't
do it, we're going to get sued.  And we don't want all
those lawsuits.  And it isn't that big a burden to say
to the person who wants the accommodation, tell us.
We get into some administrative rule about
how to elicit it from her without that simple rule, tell
us, we're going to be in a real administrative rat mess
getting sued left right and center.  Have I got the
essence of your argument?
MR. DVORETZKY:  That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
MR. DVORETZKY:  And even asking the
neutral-sounding sort of question, can you comply with
the work rule, even that, is treating applicants
differently based on --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that isn't the end of
the world, perhaps.  But you would say, look, we -- we
have thousands of managers and -- and goodness knows
they're going to get -- start getting resentful and dah,
dah, dah, dah.  I mean, I just want to be sure I've got
the argument.
MR. DVORETZKY:  That -- that is essence of
it.  But part of the reason that I think this is very
significant is that under the EEOC's own regulations, if
the applicant -- if the employer asks the
neutral-sounding question and then chooses not to hire
the person for a religion -- for a reason completely
unrelated to religion, the EEOC will infer that there
was discrimination --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Frankly, this is such an
unusual case because it's very rare that you have an
interviewer like Ms. Cooke who's honest.  And the only
reason there was a suit here was because she was honest
and came in and told someone else.  But if this young --
this young woman wasn't about to sue until she heard
this information.  Most people don't presume they're not
hired because of some religious practice.  But if you
have a policy that conflicts with your religious
practice, and the person knows you're going to wear a
yarmulke, then you might get sued.
MR. DVORETZKY:  Your Honor, I think many, if
not almost all Title VII cases do originate without any
sort of admission by the employer about what the reason
was for not hiring the individual.  And I think that the
rule that places a burden on employers to stereotype and
to raise these sorts of issues is one that will
undermine the purposes of Title VII.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Gershengorn, you have five minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice:
I'd like to make just two quick factual
points to clear up what I see to be some confusion in
the record.
First of all, there was some discussion
about whether, in fact, you needed to comply with the
Look Policy.  I point the Court to 94(a), which the --
which the district court says -- 94(a) of the Petition
Appendix -- the policy applies to all store employees,
but applicants are not required to be in compliance at
the time of the interview.
There was some question about whether Cooke
knew or didn't know about the headscarf.  It is crystal
clear that she did not know.  The district court said it
is undisputed -- I'm sorry, that Elauf did or did not
know -- it is undisputed -- this is at 97(a) of the
court's opinion -- it is undisputed that Cooke did not
tell her that Abercrombie would not permit models to
wear headscarves or to wear black clothing.
The Look Policy script, should the Court
wish to look at it, is Plaintiff's Exhibit 4 in the
trial.  It quotes what the Look Policy is.  I will
caution that it is not in the summary judgment record,
it was admitted in the damages trial.  But the Look
Policy is there and consistent with all of the
testimony, it does not mention headscarves.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you want to say a word
about what I called his administrative argument?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I would.
I think the administrative argument actually cuts in our
sense -- in our favor in a couple of ways.  First of
all, the suggestion that there are practical problems
isn't plausible.  This has been the rule for two
decades.  The Ninth Circuit, the Third Circuit, the
Seventh Circuit, everybody is applying the same test.
It's the Tenth Circuit that for the first time has
imposed these two new requirements.
Second, I don't think it's unadministrable
for exactly the reasons we talked about in my first time
up here.  An employer can structure an interview to make
sure that critical rules are followed, and the employer,
if it wants, can make no assumptions about religion.
Justice Sotomayor, if I could pick up on
your point.  I think what's important about this case
and why we think it's important, is precisely that it is
unusual.  What is unusual is that the applicant found
out why she was not hired, and that is what's strange.
Most of the time, the person just never finds out that
no accommodation was made, that the employer assumed the
accommodation was -- would be needed and just never
told.  And it's precisely why we --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't prevent a
lawsuit, of course.  I mean --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  It doesn't, Your Honor,
but --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  She can sue and then find
out in the -- in the course of discovery, right?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  They certainly could, but
--
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it happens often,
doesn't it?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  No, Your Honor, I'm not
sure that it does.  And I think this is what makes this
a very important case.  It's because most applicants --
unlike employees, who are in a position to go back and
forth with their employer and understand the work rules,
applicants are at a serious informational disadvantage.
They don't know the work rules.  And in this case, it is
undisputed that she did not.
And if I could just close then, picking up
on something Justice Kagan was pointing at, that the
background rule in Title VII is that belief is
sufficient.  But what makes this case, we think,
particularly strong, is that this is belief plus an
assumption that -- where they acted on that belief and
they assumed that she would need an accommodation from
the work rule.  That is certainly sufficient and the
Tenth Circuit was wrong to conclude otherwise.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
