CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 11-159, Astrue v. Capato.
Mr. Miller.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Social Security Administration has
reasonably interpreted the Social Security Act to
provide that, as a general rule, a person seeking to
establish eligibility for child survivor benefits must
show that he or she would have been able to inherit
personal property from the decedent under applicable
State intestacy law. That interpretation is supported
by the text, structure, and history of the Act, and it
comports with principles of federalism because it defers
to State law on the determination of family status,
which is a traditional subject of State regulation.
It's reasonable and entitled to deference under Chevron.
Now, the textual arguments in this case
involve the interaction of three provisions of the Act.
And the first is section 402(d)(1), which is the basic
benefits-granting provision. And that says that under
certain conditions, the child of a wage earner is
entitled to benefits. And that provision has a
cross-reference to a definition of "child" in section
6(e) of the Act. And 416(e), which is reprinted at
page 4a of the appendix to our brief, says that the term
"child" means (1) the child or legally adopted child of
an individual, (2) a stepchild under certain cases, and
(3) a person who is the grandchild or stepgrandchild of
an individual.
Now, I think the one thing that's
immediately apparent from looking at that provision is
that under anyone's reading, it's a little bit confusing
because it uses the word "child" twice to mean two
different things. That is, the first "child" is broader
than the second, because the first one includes the
second as well as adopted child, stepchild, and so
forth.
JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose a State legislature
got the crazy idea that children born to married people
during the time of the marriage shouldn't inherit under
State intestacy law. Would that mean that they would be
ineligible for survivors' benefits?
MR. MILLER: Not necessarily, because if
somebody doesn't qualify under -- and I should say at
the outset that that is unlike the law of any State
either in 1939 or today.
JUSTICE ALITO: But what if they did -- what
if they did that?
MR. MILLER: There -- there are two
alternative mechanisms that Congress added to the
statute in the 1960s to allow children who lack
intestacy rights to establish their eligibility. Those
are 416(h)(2)(B) and 416(h)(3). And 416(h)(3) says that
an applicant who is the son or daughter of an insured
individual but is not a child under -- under paragraph
(A), which is the reference to State intestacy law,
shall nevertheless be deemed to be a child if there was
an acknowledgment in writing that the child was -- that
the applicant was the son or daughter, or there was a
court decree for support. So, I think --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Those are -- those are
obviously meant to deal with -- with children whose
parents are not married.
MR. MILLER: That's right. And the reason
for that is that, in fact, under the law of every State,
both in 1939 and today, children whose parents are
married do have State -- do have intestacy rights. But
I think what the provision I just referred to
illustrates is that the term "child" in this statute is
a legal term of art, because if you were just looking at
the ordinary meaning of the word "child," the concept of
an applicant who is a son or daughter but is not a
child, would be completely nonsensical.
JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe it means something
else. Maybe it means that to the Congress that
initially enacted the predecessor of this provision a
child was a child. They knew what a child was. And the
type of child that I mentioned earlier was a child.
There wasn't a need for any definition of that. And
they -- they never had any inkling about the situation
that has arisen in this case, just as they had no
inkling that any State would go off and take away
intestacy rights for children born to married people
during the course of their marriage.
MR. MILLER: Well, I mean, I think -- I
think those are probably accurate factual claims about
what Congress was thinking, but had Congress wanted --
the way that Congress chose to make sure that the
children of married parents could establish their
eligibility was by looking to State intestacy law,
because Congress knew that under State intestacy law,
those children had such rights.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Isn't there something
sort of bizarre about your reading, because Congress in
the (e) section sets up very specific definitions about
stepchildren and grandchildren and even
stepgrandchildren in which State intestacy law is not
referenced? But you're saying that as to the largest
category, the category in which 90 percent of people are
going to get benefits, there Congress sent us all off to
State law.
MR. MILLER: Well, it -- that's -- that's
what section 416(h) says. Section 416(h) sets out a
rule --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose I'm not so
convinced that (h) is as clear as you think it is,
because there are two sentences of -- of section (h).
I'm just asking you to provide a reason why Congress
would have specified everything about what -- how you
get benefits for stepchildren and grandchildren and
stepchildren, but not for the main category of people at
issue.
MR. MILLER: Well, I think -- I think it's
because with respect to the main category of people at
issue, the question Congress was asking is: What is the
class of people who are likely to have a sufficiently
close relationship to the insured person such that it
would be appropriate to provide benefits to replace the
loss of support that they would likely be getting during
the person's life? And if you look at what is the body
of law that defines that class of people who have a
close relationship with someone, it's State intestacy
law. And State intestacy law sets out sort of clear,
easy-to-apply rules for the distribution of estates.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they don't
always do --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Miller, there's one
provision in (h) that's puzzling, and maybe you can tell
me what it means. It's at (h)(2)(A), and it's the last
sentence of (A). It says: "Applicants who according to
State law would have the same status relative to taking
intestate personal property as a child ... shall be
deemed such." What person is that referring to?
Someone who is not a child but has the same status as a
child?
MR. MILLER: That -- that's right. The
first sentence sets out the general rule that you look
to State law for the definition of "child." And the
second sentence says that people who do not have the
status of children but nonetheless have the inheritance
rights of children shall be deemed children. And as a
practical matter, the people that that applies to are
people who have been equitably adopted.
There's a doctrine in the law of many States
where you have an adoption -- or you have an agreement
to adopt, but not yet a completed legal adoption. In
that circumstance, the would-be adoptee does not have
the status of a child for all purposes or even
necessarily for all inheritance law purposes, but can
take property from the adopting parents. So, that's who
would be covered by that sentence, and that's now
addressed in the regulations at --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Anyone else or just that
category?
MR. MILLER: I think -- I think that is
the -- the most likely category that it would apply to.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. Go ahead.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said earlier
that the State intestacy law provides clear rules, but I
assume that's not always the case, particularly with all
this new technological advancement. There must be
situations where you can't tell what State intestacy law
provides. And what does the Social Security
Administration do in that case?
MR. MILLER: The Social Security
Administration tries to apply State law. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. My hypothetical
is that there's no clear answer. I mean, let's take a
situation where this type of reproduction is -- is new,
and the State legislatures haven't had a chance to
decide whether they want to recognize the offspring for
State intestacy law or not. What would SSA do?
MR. MILLER: Well, the SSA does the best
that it can to figure out what the State law is, and
then on review in the district court, you know, the
district court is able to review that. And there have
been cases in which district courts have certified
questions to State courts. And I think actually the
fact that there are those difficult questions that can
come up in some of the cases, particularly involving
assisted reproductive technology, really illustrates one
of the virtues of leaving it to the States rather than,
as Respondent would have it, effectively forcing SSA and
then the Federal courts on review of its decisions to
create a sort of Federal common law of parentage to
resolve all of those very difficult questions.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There was in my memory,
and it's been a while, that some States, if not all --
and that's what I was going to ask you -- basically deem
any child born during the marriage to be a child of the
marriage, whether it's a biological child or not, so
that if a mother has had a relationship outside of
marriage, the married parent's still responsible for
that child.
That would take care of, I think, a great
number, wouldn't it, of the new technology births that
occur without perhaps the input of one of -- the
biological input of one of the parents?
MR. MILLER: That -- that's right. And, in
fact, there are statutes in a number of States
addressing the question of when a -- yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. My question was,
do all States have similar rulings? And for those that
don't, what happens to a child that's been born with, as
Justice Roberts said, as the Chief said, with new
technology? What happens to that child in terms of
their definition -- of whether they'll be considered a
child for Social Security purposes?
MR. MILLER: I -- I can't speak with
certainty to all of the States, but I believe that that
is the -- the general rule. So, I'm not aware of any --
any States where, when you have a married couple using
donor -- donor sperm, that the child would not be
deemed the child of the husband.
JUSTICE SCALIA: My impression is that, I'm
not sure it's by statute, but just by judicial decision,
a child born in the marriage is a child of the marriage
unless -- unless the child is repudiated by -- by the
father.
MR. MILLER: I believe that is -- that is
the general rule. And I think one thing that that
illustrates, of course, is that Respondents' definition,
which is also the court of appeals' definition, of what
a child is and the definition that they urge the Court
to apply in 416 is the biological child of married
parents.
And not only is the -- does the "married"
part of that not comport with the ordinary understanding
of "child," because of course in ordinary usage whether
somebody is a child doesn't depend on whether their
parents are married, but the biological part also does
not comport with legal usage because, both in 1939 and
today, there are many cases in which biological
parentage is not determinative of legal parentage, both
for the reason that we were just talking about and then
also for -- another example is when you have an
adoption; a child who has been adopted by somebody else
is no longer legally the child of his biological
parents.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you tell me if -- if
the Capato twins are both found to be -- be children
within the meaning of the Act, will they meet the
dependency or the deemed dependency requirements? Or is
that a back-up argument that you have? Or --
MR. MILLER: We -- that -- that would be a
question for the agency to address in the first
instance. The agency has not addressed that question in
the administrative process here. So, we are not --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It -- it was addressed in
the Ninth -- in the Ninth Circuit decision, wasn't it?
MR. MILLER: That's right. And the Ninth
Circuit read the dependency provision of the Act to say
that any legitimate child is deemed to be dependent, and
it then conducted an examination of legitimacy under
California law.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't have a position
on that here? Or -- you want that to be elaborated more
by the agency?
MR. MILLER: That -- that's right. I mean,
I -- what I will say is, just speaking in general terms
about dependency, the statute creates a number of
presumptions that allow basically any -- any natural
child, any child under the -- that first -- that second
child in 416(e)(1), anyone who fits into that category
is deemed to be dependent. So, it doesn't necessarily
turn on -- on factual dependency, which is obviously not
present in --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Rebuttable presumption
or irrebuttable?
MR. MILLER: The presumption in favor of
dependency for anyone who qualifies is irrebuttable.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you rely only on that
-- on that definition.
The section is entitled "Old-age and
survivors insurance benefit payments," and it also
provides in (d) that a child is entitled to the benefits
if, among other things, (C) was dependent upon such
individual, (i) if such individual is living at the time
that the application was filed, (ii) if such individual
has died at the time of death, or (iii) if such
individual had a period of disability, et cetera, et
cetera.
It seems to me -- is the word "survivor"
used anywhere in the text of this statute except in
the -- in the heading of this section?
MR. MILLER: I don't -- it doesn't appear in
any of the -- the operative definitional provisions, but
I would certainly agree with you that it is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We use titles to determine
the meaning of ambiguous provisions later, don't we?
MR. MILLER: Yes, and I certainly would --
would agree with the -- the idea that it is difficult to
describe someone as a survivor who was not alive at the
time that -- or not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Nor would -- nor would he
meet the requirements of (C), would he? Would he meet
any of the requirements of (C)? Of (d)(1)(C).
MR. MILLER: The dependency requirement is
defined in 402(d)(3) and -- which unfortunately is not
reproduced in the appendix, but which has the effect of
making anyone who qualifies under 416(h) be deemed
dependent. Now, we don't think that the children in
this case qualify under 416(h). So, there's no -- not
even any need to reach the dependency question there.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Then what does -- what does
(d)(1)(C) do if it's all washed out by --
MR. MILLER: Well, the dependency
requirement is something that people who don't qualify
under 416(h), people who are adopted children or
stepchildren or grandchildren, may in some cases have to
make an individualized determination of actual
dependency.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn’s say – it
says every child as defined in 416(e) has to meet that
requirement. If such -- such child, the one defined in (e).
MR. MILLER: Right, but then -- but then
2(d)(3) says a child shall be deemed dependent under
certain circumstances that effectively track the 416(h)
analysis. And I -- I would refer you on that point to
the agency's regulations defining dependency, which are
4.361, which say that any natural child -- which is
the term the agency uses for that second child in
6(e) -- any natural child is deemed dependent. Now --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask --
Justice Scalia said that the statute is ambiguous. Is
that your position? Is it your position that the
definition of "child" is ambiguous and that we have to
give the agency deference, or is it your position that,
in context, it's unambiguous and even if the Social
Security Administration wanted to extend benefits, it
couldn't, in the circumstances of this case?
MR. MILLER: I think that when the statute
was initially enacted in 1939 with more or less the same
structure of these provisions as we have now, it might
at that time have been ambiguous. But the agency
adopted an interpretation that is, again, in structure
materially identical to its current interpretation in
40, and it has adhered to it ever since. And Congress
has amended the statute with the understanding that that
was the interpretation, that everybody had to go through
State law to qualify.
And I think in light of that history, at
this point -- and Congress's ratification of that
understanding, at this point the best view is that it is
unambiguous and clearly resolves the question in favor
of the interpretation set out in the agency's
regulations.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Miller, could I take you
back to 416(e)? I take it that you don't contest that
for purposes of deciding the -- which stepchildren get
benefits and which grandchildren get benefits, we're
just looking to Federal law, that we don't look to State
law on those questions; is that correct?
MR. MILLER: Yes, because those terms do not
appear in 416(h). There's -- there's no instruction in
the statute that those terms be defined by reference to
State law, as there is with respect to "child."
JUSTICE KAGAN: And, you know, I'm looking
at some of these, the grandchildren one, for example.
It says a person who is the grandchild, but only if,
blah, blah, blah. It seems to have just sort of an
understanding of what a grandchild is. In other words,
it's not really defining a grandchild here; it's
limiting a class of grandchildren with a pre-existing
understanding of what a grandchild is. And so, I'm
wondering, if that's true of grandchildren, why isn't it
also true of children?
MR. MILLER: Well, I should say two things
about that, then. The first is, specifically with
respect to grandchildren, the agency's -- the agency
defines a grandchild as the child, within the meaning of
the statute, of a child. And that's set out in the
regulations at 404.358.
JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry, the child of a
child. The child -- what kind of child?
MR. MILLER: Well, somebody -- somebody who
would qualify under 416(h) as a child.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Oh, so, for grandchildren,
the agency is also looking to State law?
MR. MILLER: Indirectly. I mean, a
grandchild is not expressly defined in the Act, but
somebody who qualifies either under State law or you can
also qualify as a stepchild or adopted child of someone
who qualifies as a child in that same sense.
But -- I mean, again, the lack of a -- what's
significant, I think, is the lack of any other provision
in the statute that tells you how to define
"grandchild." I mean, the -- the run of cases that
Congress was concerned about involved children, and for
-- in explaining to the agency how to deal with those
cases, Congress gave explicit guidance, and that's to
look to State law, in 416(h).
Now, Respondent makes much of the fact that
the benefits-granting provision, 402(d), has an express
cross-reference to the definition in 416(e) but doesn't
cross-reference the definition in 416(h).
And I think there are two problems with that
argument, the first of which is that 416(h) by its own
terms says that it applies for purposes of this
subchapter, that is throughout all of the parts of the
Act that we're talking about here. So, effectively
6(h) incorporates itself into the 416(e) definition,
and there's no need for an express cross-reference.
The second point about that is that the
structure of the definitions here is very similar to the
structure of the definitions used in defining other
family relationships that are eligible for benefits.
So, under 402, some of the other subsections of 402,
there are benefits for the wife or husband or widow or
widower of an insured person. And just to take the
benefits for a wife as an example, in 402(b) the statute
says that the "wife (as defined in section 416(b) of
this title)" under certain circumstances can get
benefits.
If you look at the definition in 416(b) of
"wife," it's very much like the definition in 416(e).
It says, "the term 'wife' means the wife of an
individual," and then it has some limitations. So, if
you were to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you -- go ahead and
finish.
MR. MILLER: If you were to take
Respondents' approach, you would just stop there and
apply some sort of Federal standard of figuring out
whether people are married or not. But in fact 416(h),
in paragraph (1) of 416(h), says an applicant is the
wife or husband or widow or widower of an insured person
if the State courts would regard them as being married.
So -- and in the 1939 Act, all of those
references to State law for wives and widows and
children were all combined in one paragraph, so it was
even clearer that that was how the statute worked, that
you look to State law for defining all these family
relationships.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I now have in
front of me (h)(3). I don't see how it has anything to
do with whether the child was dependent under (d)(1)(C).
Why do you think it has something to do with that?
MR. MILLER: I'm sorry. The -- the
definition of dependency is in -- is in(d)(3),
2(d)(3), not -- if you're -- 402(d)(3) says a child
shall be deemed dependent upon his father unless at such
time such individual was not living with or contributing
to the support of such child and the child is neither
the legitimate nor adopted child of the individual. So,
the effect of that is anyone who is a legitimate child
is deemed dependent under 402(d)(3).
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, unless such
individual was not living with or contributing to the
support of such child -- which is certainly the case
here; the child had not yet been born -- and other
qualifications. The principal condition does not exist.
Shall be deemed dependent upon his father or adopting
father unless at such time such individual, mother or
father or adopted father was not living with or
contributing to the support of such child. How does
that alter the dependency requirement of (d)(1)(C)?
MR. MILLER: Well, because the child is
deemed dependent unless he was -- I mean, again,
since -- to be clear, we -- we think that the children
in this case do not -- are not eligible for child status
because they don't meet the requirements of 416(h).
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may well be.
MR. MILLER: And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If that is ambiguous, why
doesn't -- why doesn't (d)(1)(C), despite -- what is it
(h)(3) or whatever the 3 we're -- we've been playing
with here -- despite (d)(3), despite that, it seems to
me that they don't meet that requirement.
MR. MILLER: That -- that might well be the
case. Our position is simply that that's not an issue
that the agency has addressed and that would be a matter
for the agency to resolve in the first instance if this
Court were to disagree with us on the definition of
"child."
I referred a minute ago to the 1939 Act and
the structure of that Act, and I think that that's very
instructive because, again, the way that the provisions
were arranged in the 1939 Act, as we set out in our
brief, were the same for present purposes as they are
today. And Congress, when it amended the Act in the
60s to allow certain nonmarital children to be
eligible for child status, recognized that that was the
case, recognized the commission's interpretation that
everybody had to go through 416(h) and establish their
eligibility under State law, and then chose to make
express exceptions to the requirement of State law for
those children. No such exception applies here.
If I could reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Miller.
Mr. Rothfeld.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
If I can, I'll start with a question that
Justice Sotomayor asked about the ambiguity or not of the
statute, and we think that in fact the statute is not
ambiguous at all. We think that it unambiguously
dictates the reading that we advance. And it's useful,
I think, in addressing the case to recognize that it
presents essentially two issues. One is whether all of
the categories of applicants for child survivor benefits
that are defined to be children in the statutory
definition of "child," section 416, qualify for child
benefits without reference to State law, as we submit.
If they do, then the second question is
whether the children in this case, the Capato twins,
fall within one of the categories of children so
defined. And we think that they very clearly do.
Congress said expressly that every child as
defined by 416(e) shall receive benefits so long as they
satisfy certain criteria that are not at issue in this
case. Section 416(e), to which Congress has expressly
directed us in determining who is a child eligible for
these benefits, defines a child to be (1) a child or
adopted child, (2) a stepchild --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Could you
tell me what purpose 416(h) serves in this statute --
MR. ROTHFELD: We think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- given that you
believe that 416(e) is self-sufficient unto itself?
MR. ROTHFELD: We think subsection 416(e) is
sufficient as to the children defined to be a child
within that statute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As the child who should
receive. So, what's the purpose of (h)?
MR. ROTHFELD: And our understanding of who
falls within section 416(e), (e)(1), definition of
"child," is the natural child, the biological child of
married parents. There are, of course --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, the -- a child who
was born during marriage but is not a biological child
wouldn't qualify?
MR. ROTHFELD: No -- well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even though they qualify
under State law as a child?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, as to the question of
what (h) is designed to accomplish, we think that
Congress enacted (h) for children whose parentage or
parental relationships were unclear, which would
principally have been children who were born outside of
marriage, as to whom there was no presumption --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, would this -- let's
assume Ms. Capato remarried but used her deceased
husband's sperm to -- to birth two children. They're
the biological children of the Capatos. Would they
qualify for survivor benefits even though she's now
remarried?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that's an
interesting and more difficult question than what we
have here. I think that the answer may well be "yes,"
and I think that the -- situations like that can arise
really in -- outside of the IVF context. That's a
related situation.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's -- you see,
a situation like that is what is making me uncomfortable
because I don't see the words "biological" in the
statute. I don't see the word "marriage" directly
when -- within the definition of "child." So, where do
I draw them from? Where do I come --
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me answer both of
those questions. As to where marriage comes from, I
think from a number of sources. One is the point that
was raised by Justice Alito and Justice Kagan, that at
the time Congress enacted the statute in 1939, the
overwhelming majority of children in the United States,
more than 90 percent -- it was actually more than 95
percent -- were the children of married parents. And
so, when Congress --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be true
under State intestate law.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, simply as to what
Congress had in mind when it said a child is a child --
and you asked where marriage comes from in the
statute -- I think when Congress said a child is a
child, as I think Justice Alito's question suggested, it
would have had in mind the paradigm of a child at that
time, which was the children --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the words -- you say
this is plain meaning. It says the child of a wage
earner, an individual; a child -- it seems to me you are
importing the term "married," because someone can be the
undisputed child of a wage earner who is unmarried. So,
it's not a question of disputed versus undisputed. A
wage earner can have a child, undisputed that the wage
earner is the parent, but the wage earner is not married.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me say two things
about that. And, first, to continue the question of
where marriage comes from, there is a textual reference
to marriage which appears in section 416(h)(2)(B), the
companion to the intestacy provision upon which the
Government relies.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought we weren't
supposed to look to (h) at all. I mean, your thesis is
(e) covers it --
MR. ROTHFELD: But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and there's no reason
to refer to (h).
MR. ROTHFELD: But I think (h) reflects what
Congress had in mind in the statutory definition,
because in the provision that I'm referring to, Congress
said that if the parents went through a form of marriage
that was defective in some sense, nevertheless the child
would be deemed to be a child, which tells us that
marriage (a) was a significant part of what constitutes
childness as defined --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't -- look,
when Congress says "child," "child" means child, and the
mere fact that Congress wrote that at an age when most
children were indeed children of married people doesn't
change the word "child." I mean, we don't go back and
say -- Congress often uses words that go beyond what --
what their immediate concern is, and here they used the
word "child."
MR. ROTHFELD: But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You want us to probe their
mind and say, well, since 90 percent of all children
were children of married people, that's what they must
have meant by "child." I just don't think that follows
at all. "Child" means child.
MR. ROTHFELD: If I may, Your Honor,
Congress wrote a Federal definition of "child," and as
Mr. Miller acknowledged in his opening argument, when
Congress defined "child," it defined "child" to include
a number of things.  The first thing that it defined was
a child is a child or adopted child and stepchild,
grandchild, stepgrandchild. Congress used the word
"child" to have a particular meaning, because it said a
child is a child and other things. The other things
that it mentioned were --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Rothfeld, I guess
the question is, when it says a child is a child, does
it mean a child is a child born in wedlock or a child is
just a child? And we know that Congress knew how to
distinguish between the two because Congress
distinguished between the two in this very Act in the
dependency provisions. It talks about the legitimate
child of such individual. Well, here it didn't add that
word. It just said "the child."
MR. ROTHFELD: But -- and I think the reason
it did that, I mean, as -- again, as Mr. Miller said,
Congress used the "child" in two senses. It used the
word "child" in the generic sense: Everyone who
qualifies for child benefits is a child. So, it said
"child" is, in that sense, a child, adopted child,
stepchild, so forth.
In the dependency section, Congress is
referring to all children, all children in that -- in
the generic sense, everybody who qualifies for benefits
as a child. And, therefore, Congress had to distinguish
between what we say it meant when it said a child is a
child, natural child of married parents --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Are there any other statutes
that you can point to around this time which support the
notion that when people said "child" they meant child
within a legal marriage?
MR. ROTHFELD: I can't point to specifically
that, because I think it was clear when Congress used
the word "child" that that's what they had in mind as a
generic matter. As I suggested, when --
JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. You can't point
to anything because it's so clear?
MR. ROTHFELD: In a sense, that's right. If
everyone knew what the word meant -- the word "child" was
used to define, I think, the category that people would
have had in mind when they thought of a child in the legal
sense.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rothfeld, don't you
run into a problem? Perhaps not in 1939, but since then
this Court has had a number of decisions that deal with
the distinction between children born in and out of
wedlock, and in some of those cases, it has held that
the distinction between the two is unconstitutional,
that there are no illegitimate children. All children
are legitimate, whatever their parents may be.
MR. ROTHFELD: That is true. But I think
the question is, what was the intent of Congress when it
wrote this statute in 1939?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but if we are going
to apply those equal protection decisions to this
statute --
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that may
suggest that an unfavorable application of the statute
to children born out of wedlock would be
unconstitutional. But the question of whether or not
Congress intended to provide benefits to these
children --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I suppose the question
is aren't you at the very least getting us into a
situation where we should interpret the statute the
Government's way because of constitutional avoidance
concerns?
MR. ROTHFELD: I think that the contrary is
true. I think that you should interpret it our way
because the Government's application sort of disfavors
children who are born through, you know -- through
assisted means by its incorporation of State law in
favor of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it disfavors children
who are born after the father has died, which is in
accord with the title of the statute: survivors
benefits.
MR. ROTHFELD: But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's issue here -- what's
at issue here is not whether children that have been
born through artificial insemination get benefits. It's
whether children who are born after the father's death
get -- get benefits.
MR. ROTHFELD: But I think -- I suspect the
reason that Mr. Miller was resisting your questions on
that point is there is no question that children who are
born -- who are, quote, conceived naturally in the marriage
and are born after the father's death are deemed to be
dependents and receive benefits. That has been the
consistent position of the agency, and we think that
that's clearly right. So, I don't think that the fact
the child was born after death says dispositively that
they were not dependent upon --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm interested as to
what your definition of "child" is. Is it just a
biological offspring? Is it limited to a biological
offspring born of a particular marriage, but in what
context? Because we go back to Justice Ginsburg's
question of what happens if the -- if the decedent is
the mother. There's no question that she bore this
child. Married or unmarried, does it matter?
Does marriage matter only if it's the father
that's the decedent? What is your --
MR. ROTHFELD: We think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If there is a sperm
donor, does any offspring that sperm donor have qualify?
MR. ROTHFELD: No, we -- we think not,
because what we think what Congress had in mind when it said
in the first part of clause (1) of the definition of
child is the child, the natural child -- and I use
natural as distinct from adopted child or stepchild who
are dealt with separately in the statute, which is why
we think it is clear that Congress was there talking
about natural children, biological children -- the
natural children of married parents, which we -- as I
say, the reason we think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, a mother who is
unmarried who bears a child, this child is not
automatically covered.
MR. ROTHFELD: We think that as Congress
wrote the statute in 1939, that's correct, and that
child would then have been referred to the intestacy
provision upon which the Government relies, and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, so there are
situations in which you think those provisions should
govern.
MR. ROTHFELD: Yes. Absolutely. We think
that those provisions were added as an additive
provision as a mechanism for children who do not qualify
for the definition to be deemed a child.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is what was not
clear to me. So, you're -- you're not arguing that
"child" has just one natural meaning.
MR. ROTHFELD: We -- we argue that Congress
used the word "child" --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In whatever meaning you
could give it.
MR. ROTHFELD: We -- I wouldn't say that. I
think that when Congress said a child is a child, which
is the provision of the statute we were referring to,
it was distinguishing the child from the adopted child and
stepchild, and we think they were doing it in the
context of marriage because (a) that was the paradigm of
family relationships at the time; (b) we think the
reason -- what Congress was very concerned with
accomplishing in the statute was guaranteeing certainty
in the -- in parentage and the parental relationship.
And it set up a system of -- because in 1939
there were no genetic paternity tests, there was no --
it was impossible to be absolutely, scientifically
certain as to who the -- at least as to who the father was,
Congress set up a series of proxies to establish whether
or not the applicant for child benefits was in fact the
child.
The principal one of those was the marital
relationship because in 1939, as I think
Justice Scalia's question suggested, there was a very
strong, virtually per se conclusive presumption that a
child born in marriage was the biological natural child
of both the father and mother, of the married couple.
And so, the existence of the marriage was a way of
establishing in 1939 dispositively that the child was
the child of the parents, the child of the survivor --
of the insured whose eligibility for benefits are being
invoked here.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, I'm curious
why you didn't argue a different theory, which is that
(e) refers to all biological children whether in
marriage or outside of marriage, and then (h) is set up
for cases in which biological status is contested.
I mean, what would you think of that theory?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- we would certainly
embrace it if the Court were --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why didn't you argue
MR. ROTHFELD: I think -- we think that we
are arguing essentially a -- sort of a subset of that
theory. Our sense of what Congress was up to was that
it wanted to assure certainty, as I just said in
response to the previous question, in establishing
parentage. And the principal way in 1939 that Congress
could do that was by (a) invoking existence of a
parental relationship which established sort of as a per
se matter that the children born within the marriage
were the children of each of the married -- each member
of the married couple.
For parents -- children who did not fall
into that category, there was this additive provision,
section (h), which provided a mechanism for doing it,
and establishing that State intestacy law would
recognize this child as the child of -- typically it was
going to be the paternity that was contested -- the
child of the father, (h) established a mechanism for
doing that. So, I think that we are getting to the same
place --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if --
MR. ROTHFELD: -- that your question
suggests.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the children
-- well, I don't want -- the Capato twins were conceived
years after of the death in this case?  Would your
argument be the same?
MR. ROTHFELD: I think that our argument
would be the same, but as a practical matter, almost all
of these cases involve children who were born relatively
soon after.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? Why
would they all involve children born relatively soon
after?
MR. ROTHFELD: They don't necessarily have
to, but I think the practical reason why they do is that
it's often the case that the surviving mother has
children to produce a family sibling for an already
existing child as was -- as was the case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there's no
reason it couldn't take place 4 years after.
MR. ROTHFELD: There is no reason. That's
correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what happens if
the biological mother remarries or something and then
goes through this process? Does the child get double
survivor benefits or --
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, it --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which -- I assume
you would argue that in that case the child is eligible
through two different routes.
MR. ROTHFELD: Potentially, that's correct.
There are rules in the Act that prevent double recovery
of survivor benefits. And so, I don't think that would
be an issue that would arise here. But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rothfeld, these
children were born 18 months after the insured wage
earner died. If we look to other categories of
children, say, stepchildren -- and there is also one for
adopted children. For stepchildren, they qualify only
if they had that status no less than 9 months before the
wage earner died, and adopted children is also a
limitation. The stepchild and the adopted child --
there could never be any question of being born
months later. They wouldn't qualify. There's --
there is a time limit for the other children. And if
Congress had thought about this problem, maybe it would
have put a time limit on this, too.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that the
question that the Court has to confront here is,
Congress wrote a Federal definition of the word "child."
And it was -- sort of the first question in the case, I
think, is whether we are correct in our understanding
that, when Congress wrote this definition, all
applicants for child survivor benefits who fall within
that category, those defined categories, qualify.
And then we have -- if the answer to that is
"yes," and so children as defined in clause (1) of the
definition, which we think that the Capato children do,
whether or not all children so defined qualify for
benefits without regard to State intestacy law. If we
are right about that, then that raises the question what
is the meaning of "child" in the -- in the statute? And
we think that --
JUSTICE BREYER: The question is what -- you
haven't mentioned the text that suggests you're not
right, which is right in (h) which says: In determining
whether an applicant is a child of an insured, the
Commissioner shall apply such law as intestacy law.
Okay? That's what it says. Now, how do you
get out of that?
MR. ROTHFELD: Because --
--
JUSTICE BREYER: Because you say, well,
there's an implicit exception.
MR. ROTHFELD: No, no. That's not what we
JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying that that
doesn't apply. And so, I've listened carefully to your
reasons for saying why (h) doesn't apply when its
language seems to say it does apply, and I'm not sure of
why it doesn't apply. I mean --
MR. ROTHFELD: Because --
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that two parents
have lived together for 6 years and 4 months in State X,
and they have a child. Fine. The father dies. Were
they married? They never went through a ceremony. Is
there a common law marriage? Might it depend on the
State? Do you know the answer in every State? My
answer is: You don't know. And I don't know. And,
therefore, we have to look to the law of the State in
order to see whether that (e) is satisfied. Now, we
have to look to it to decide if they're married. Even
you say that.
So, what Congress did is it found a pretty
good shorthand way of saying where you look. We're not
going to worry about 6 years and 2 months; we're just
going to look at their intestacy law. That's, as I read
it, what it seems to say.
Now, I have been listening to you ,
and I don't see how you're going to save us from
even worse problems, particularly when I started looking
at the state of the artificial insemination and so
forth, and every State has a dozen different variations.
There are uniform acts. There are things you have to
acknowledge in writing. It's a very complicated
subject. And -- and that's why I am rather hesitant to
read it the way you want. But I want you to reply to
that.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, the answer to the first
sentence of section (h), if that were the only thing in
the statute, I think that you would be right, but
there's a second sentence to (h), which says in -- in
applying State intestacy law, the -- the Commissioner is
supposed to look at the status of an applicant and
determine whether or not the status of the applicant is
the same as that of a child. And if so, the applicant
is deemed --
JUSTICE BREYER: Where is that sentence?
MR. ROTHFELD: That appears in -- it's --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is it the bottom of the
paragraph?
MR. ROTHFELD: It's the bottom of the
paragraph.
JUSTICE BREYER: It says, "Applicants who
according to such law would have the same status
relative to taking intestate property as a child or a
parent shall be deemed such."
MR. ROTHFELD: And that --
JUSTICE BREYER: So?
MR. ROTHFELD: But as a child. Why does it
-- it requires a comparison to someone who is a child.
"Child" is defined in section (h). If -- if -- I think
the problem with the Government's interpretation of the
first sentence of that -- of section (h) is that it
makes the -- the statute circular.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I haven't found the
sentence you're talking about. Where is it?
JUSTICE BREYER: At the bottom of the paragraph.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Bottom of what? Page what?
MR. ROTHFELD: It is at page 9a of the --
the appendix to the Government's brief.
JUSTICE BREYER: It's sort of like a -- you
say there is no board of tax -- sorry. I won't get into
that. But -- because they used the word "deemed." Is
that right?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the heart of your
argument there.
MR. ROTHFELD: That's our explanation of
what Congress was up to in the statute.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right.
MR. ROTHFELD: It --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MR. ROTHFELD: It was an additive provision
that says that if you are the same -- and I think this
is an important point, Justice Breyer. If you are the
same as a child, you are deemed to have child status.
You can't --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But then, Mr. Rothfeld, why can't
one just say, well, first sentence, who is a child? Look
to State law. Second sentence, when State law treats
other people as children, you should treat them as other
-- as children, too. So, the two sentences can cohere
fine. For children, look to State law, and also look to
State law to see who they treat just like children.
MR. ROTHFELD: But I -- I think that is not
a plausible reading of -- of the text, Justice Kagan.
JUSTICE BREYER: The obvious practical thing
is --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why not?
JUSTICE BREYER: -- is that -- that, you
know, once you get beyond this and the child wasn't
even -- if he's conceived -- or what the father could
do, couldn't he just write a note and say this is my
child even if it's conceived later, and then wouldn't he
fall within one of these other exceptions, the exception
for being acknowledged?
MR. ROTHFELD: He -- he would not. The
father here did in fact write such a note, but I --
JUSTICE BREYER: He has acknowledged in
writing that the applicant is his son or daughter. What
about that one?
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I think that the problem
is that that has to be during the life of the father.
JUSTICE BREYER: Does it? It doesn't say
it. I mean, it seemed to me easier to work with that
one than the one you're trying to work with. But I -- I
don't know. You're the -- but -- but anyway, what I'm
worried about here --
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- well, I don't want
to argue against my position, Justice Breyer, but --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I know.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What I'm actually
worried about and want you to address is I just -- if we
were to adopt what you said, what they're concerned
about is many different applicants coming back later.
That's what State intestacy is concerned about. And you
don't really know who their parents is. Another thing
is there are already children who are eating up all of
the money. And then some new person shows up, and you
have to take the money away from the other children in
order to give it to this new child. And all the time,
you don't know if that's what the parent who is dead
really wanted.
And so, that's why the States have gone into
all kinds of writing requirements. And -- and you want
us to sort of -- applying this old law to new
technology, just overlook those complications.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, Congress wrote a
Federal definition of "child," and it's not an
extraordinary thing for Congress to write a statute that
has language that applies in certain circumstances, and
the world changes. New developments require application
of the statutory text to those new developments.
If our reading of the statute is correct --
if what we think that Congress had in mind when it wrote
this statute was that it wanted to set in place
categories of applicants for child benefits as to whom
parentage in a relevant sense could be determined with
certainty, and it did that by focusing on the status of
the marital relationship between the parents, and it did
it by providing an alternative basis in section (h) --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that would be fine
if the statute said what you claim it says. It says a
child is a child of a wage earner. And you'd have to
import these things that Congress didn't say to get to
what you claim is the plain meaning. But what do you do
with the sentence in (h)(2)(A) that says "in determining
whether an applicant is a child of an insured individual
for purposes of this subchapter"? The subchapter is not
for purposes of (h), but for purposes of the entire
subchapter, which would include (e).
MR. ROTHFELD: Right. And I think actually
that is a helpful point for us, Justice Ginsburg,
because in determining whether an applicant is a child
for purposes of the subchapter, it's referring to the
use of the word "child" in the generic sense, in the
sense -- when -- when Congress said a child is defined
to include people who fall in these various categories
of children. So, everybody --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how could it do that
when the rest of the sentence says, "to determine
whether an applicant is a child for purposes of this
subchapter, the Commissioner shall apply the State law
of intestacy"?
MR. ROTHFELD: But I -- I think that -- that
these two sentences have to be read together as
accomplishing the same thing. What I think what the --
it's saying that in making the determination whether or
not a child qualifies for child benefits, that the
Commissioner -- applicants who according to such law
would have the same status relative to taking intestate
personal property as a child shall be deemed such.
I think one can't apply the statute without
knowing who a child is, because it -- it is directing
the Commissioner to engage in a comparison. It's
directing the Commissioner to say: Does this applicant
have the same status as a child?
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's exactly right,
Mr. Rothfeld. But you have two choices. In the second
sentence, you do have two groups, and one has to be
compared to the other, which is children. The question
is, are children described by the first sentence of
that, or are children described by the (e) section?
So, you're just reading the first sentence
out of the statute and saying that the second sentence
totally subsumes the first sentence, and we have to go
back to (e).
But the first sentence exists. And it says:
Who are children? Children are who they are under State
law.
MR. ROTHFELD: No, and I -- I think that
what it's telling the Commissioner to do is to determine
whether or not -- when an applicant who does not fall
within one of the defined categories in section (e)
applies for benefits, the Commissioner is to determine
whether or not that child has the same status relative
to State law as the child as defined in the definitional
section.
The Congress -- as I say, Congress said
expressly that a child as defined in section 416(e) of
the statute qualifies for benefits. And so, I think it
establishes a Federal standard as to what -- what a
child is for purposes of the Act.
The Court has to determine what that
standard means to apply to any particular child.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, under
Chevron, you lose if the statute is ambiguous. Is there
any reason we shouldn't conclude based on the last hour
that it's at least ambiguous?
(Laughter.)
MR. ROTHFELD: Well --
JUSTICE KAGAN: It's a mess.
(Laughter.)
MR. ROTHFELD: I think the problem is that
we are dealing with new technologies that Congress
didn't -- wasn't anticipating at the time. I think --
one of the questions that was suggested to my friend,
Mr. Miller, by Justice Alito, I think, that if the child
who is the -- in 1939, who is the child of married
parents, natural child of married parents, sought
benefits under this statute and they were denied because
some State developed an aberrant law of intestacy and
said that such child would not qualify, would not be
deemed to be the child of their parents, I think that
that would have been regarded as a clear misreading of
the statute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How -- do you think that
Congress thought of either of these situations as real
possibilities? Do you really think that the 1939
Congress, or even the one that passed the later statute,
ever thought that a State would disinherit a naturally
born -- all naturally born children -- or that children
could be born 18 months, 4 years, 50 years later?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They weren't thinking of
either.
So, the question becomes, given the language
of (h) that says define "child" this way throughout the
subchapter, why shouldn't we give that directive its
plain meaning?
That's really the argument that you have to
convince us of.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, if we have to convince
you not to give the statute its plain reading, then we
will -- not going to prevail. I certainly recognize
that -- that plain meaning has to control. And as I
suggested at the outset, the reason we think we prevail
is that the plain meaning of this statute as was written
in 1939, as it would have been understood by the 1939
Congress that adopted it, was that the natural children
of married parents, the paradigm of the situation of the
child at that time, would fall into this category. Now,
it is certainly true, as you say --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's because every
State law recognized them as such as well, correct?
MR. ROTHFELD: And every State law -- and I
would put it the other way: Every State law recognized
them as such because that was the way in which children
were understood -- the meaning of the term "child" was
understood at the time. And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if we're going back
to 1939 understanding, wasn't it also understood that
the marriage ends when a parent dies?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, there wouldn't be --
a child that's born 18 months after the father died
wouldn't be considered a child of a marriage because the
marriage would have ended.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that one has to
look at what Congress at the time -- I guess I would put
it this way: If -- if the Court were to accept our view
that Congress had in mind the children of married
parents, the question is whether any particular child
falls in the box Congress would have regarded as the
marital box or the non-married box.
Situations like this simply could not have
arisen in 1939. Congress would not have specifically –
as Justice Sotomayor said, Congress would not have
specifically had in mind, contemplated, the question of
posthumous conception because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rothfeld, I know that
the Government didn't rely on it, but just to satisfy my
curiosity, how -- how can this child satisfy the
requirements of (d)(1)(C), with regard to dependency
upon the father?
MR. ROTHFELD: I guess two responses to
that. One, as Mr. Miller said, this -- that issue was
remanded to be addressed by --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. But --
MR. ROTHFELD: But the answer --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that is connected with
this other issue.
MR. ROTHFELD: The answer -- the answer why
we think -- and if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, answer.
The reason that we think we would prevail on
that question is because, as Mr. Miller said, Congress
created a -- an irrebuttable presumption that the child
of -- the legitimate child of -- of a parent is deemed
to have been dependent upon that parent at the time of
the parent's death. And that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you very much, Your
Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Miller, you have
minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MILLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Since 1940, the Social Security
Administration has consistently interpreted the Act to
require all natural children to establish their
eligibility under 416(h), either by establishing that
they can inherit under State law or by showing that they
qualify under one of the express exceptions --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Miller, what do you
think is wrong with the alternative theory that -- that
I suggested, that (e) is all biological children in a
marriage, not in a marriage, doesn't matter; and that
(h) is designed to deal with situations in which
biological status is contested?
MR. MILLER: Well, I -- the principal
problem with that, I think, is that it lacks -- it's not
supported by the text of what 416(h) says.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But why do you think that?
What would you point to in (h) that is inconsistent with
the theory that I just gave you?
MR. MILLER: I would point to (h)(2)(B) and
(h)(3), both of which are -- are the exceptions to allow
people to qualify when they can't establish State
intestacy rights, and both of which refer to someone who
is the son or daughter of the insured person but is not,
and is not deemed to be, the child.
So, if biological parentage were -- were
what was determinative under (e), and if you only looked
at (h) when there was some question about biological
parentage, it would -- the idea of someone who is a son
or daughter but isn't a child would make no sense.
And so, to give effect to those meanings --
to give effect to those provisions, to give them
meaning, 416(h) has to have broader application than
just in cases of disputed biological parentage. It is
in fact the gateway through which everyone has to pass,
and that's how the -- the agency has -- has so regarded
The final point I would make is simply that,
even if the statute were silent on whether to look to
State law, it would be appropriate for the Court to
hesitate, I think, before creating what in effect is a
body of Federal common law about parental status. Here,
of course, there's an express textual command the
other way. And it would be particularly inappropriate
to create, as Respondents are urging, a Federal rule
that goes well beyond what any State would allow in the
context of --
JUSTICE ALITO: Why doesn't the last
sentence of -- what is it -- (h)(2)(A) show that
Congress had in mind a certain idea of a category of
people who were indisputably children? I don't see how
you can get around that, because it says what you're
looking for under State law is to determine whether
someone has the same status relative to taking intestate
personal property as a child.
MR. MILLER: I think the answer to that is
the one suggested by Justice Kagan a few minutes ago,
and that is that you have to read the first and second
sentences together. And the first sentence sets up a
general rule that you're looking to State law, and then
the second is about people who would have the same
status as children under State law. So, that the basic
background definition in either case is coming from
State law.
JUSTICE ALITO: So, if the person is a
child -- you have applicants who according to State law
had the same status as a child, a person has that status
because the person is a child, and the person is deemed
to be a child, it seems very clear that that shows that
(h) -- that this provision is directed to people that
Congress in 1939 did not think fell within this paradigm
of a child.
MR. MILLER: The -- well, the second --
maybe, I may be misunderstanding you, but our view of
what the second sentence does is that it covers people
who are not treated as children, who are not children
under State law but nonetheless have the inheritance
rights of children. So, principally the -- in the case
of equitable adoption, those people would have the
status of children.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Miller, Mr. Rothfeld.
The case is submitted.
