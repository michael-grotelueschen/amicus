Commission v. Actavis.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
As a general matter, a payment from one
business to another in exchange for the recipient's
agreement not to compete is an paradigmatic antitrust
trust violation. The question presented here is whether
such a payment should be treated as lawful when it is
encompassed within the settlement of a patent
infringement suit. The answer to that question is no.
Reverse payments to settle Hatch-Waxman
suits are objectionable for the same reasons that
payments not to compete are generally objectionable.
They subvert the competitive process by giving generic
manufacturers an incentive to accept a share of their
rival's monopoly profits as a substitute for actual
competition in the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why are payments not
to compete different from, let's say, dividing a market?
I mean, suppose there's a lawsuit, somebody challenging
the validity of the patent and the patentee agrees to
allow the person challenging the patent to have
exclusive -- exclusive rights to sell in a particular
area.
Does that violate the antitrust laws?
MR. STEWART: I mean, there are really two
differences between that -- that scenario and the one
presented here. The first is that an exclusive license
is expressly authorized by the Patent Act, in Section
261 of Title 35, but -- but the second thing is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that doesn't
impress me. What else? What's your second point?
(Laughter.)
MR. STEWART: The second thing is that an
exclusive license doesn't give the -- the infringement
defendant anything that it couldn't hope to achieve by
prevailing in the lawsuit. That is, if the -- at least
any right to compete that it wouldn't get by prevailing
in the lawsuit.
If the infringement defendant won, it would
be able to sell wherever it wanted to.
Now, there may be some --
JUSTICE SCALIA: In order to make money. I
mean, that's -- that's what it wants is money.
MR. STEWART: But the point of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So instead of giving them a
license to compete -- you know, we'll short-circuit the
whole thing, here's the money. Go away.
MR. STEWART: But the point here is that the
money is being given as a substitute for earning profits
in a competitive marketplace. That is, in -- in the
Hatch-Waxman settlement context, by definition, we have
a disagreement by parties as to the relative merits of
the infringement and -- and/or validity questions as
to the patent infringement suit.
The brand name is saying its patent is valid
and infringed. The generic is saying either that the
patent is invalid or that its own conduct won't be
infringing or both. And if the generic wins, it will be
able to enter the market immediately. If the brand name
wins, it will be able to keep the generic off until the
patent expires.
And so in that circumstance, a logical
subject of compromise would be to agree upon an entry
date in between those two end points, just as the
parties to a damages action would be expected to settle
the case by the defendant agreeing to pay a portion of
the money it would have to pay if it lost. That's an
actual subject of compromise and we don't have a problem
with that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, do you have a
case in which the patentee, acting within the scope of
the patent, has nonetheless been held liable under the
antitrust laws --
MR. STEWART: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for something that it's
done acting within the scope of the patent?
MR. STEWART: Yes, if you adopt Respondent's
conception of what it means to act within the scope of
the patent. And let me explain. When Respondents
say that the restrictions at issue here are within the
scope of the patent, what they mean is that the goods
that are being restricted are arguably encompassed by
the patent and the restriction doesn't extend past the
date when the patent expires.
That's all they mean. And if that were the
exclusive test, the defendants in Masonite, in New
Wrinkle, in Line Material, they would all have been off
the hook because all of those cases involved
restrictions on trade in patented goods during the
period that the patent was in effect, and yet, the Court
found antitrust liability in each of these.
Now, the way that Respondent tries to
explain Masonite, for example, Masonite involved a
resale price maintenance agreement in which the
patentholder sold goods and then attempted to control
the price at which they would be resold, and the Court
said that under the rule of patent exhaustion, the
patentholder didn't have the right to do that and
therefore the patent laws provided no shield and the
agreement was held to be a violation of the antitrust
laws.
Now, Respondents say, well, that's
consistent with their theory because the restriction
imposed went beyond the scope of the patent because the
right to control resale is not one of the rights that
the Patent Act confers.
But if that's the test for whether a
restriction is within the scope of the patent, then we
would say that it's not met here because there's nothing
in the Patent Act that says you can pay your competitor
not to engage in conduct that you believe to be
infringing.
And really that's the thrust of their
position, that if you have -- if a patentholder has a
non-sham allegation that a particular mode of
competition would be an infringement of its patent, the
patentholder can pay the competitor not to engage in
that competition.
Again, we are not talking about conduct in
which there has been any judicial determination that
infringement has occurred. We are just talking about
cases in which the patent holder has a non-sham
allegation that infringement would occur.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stewart, does this
represent a change in the government's position? I got
the idea from the briefs that at the time of this
Schering-Plough case, that was also before the Eleventh
Circuit, that the government was not taking that
position it is now taking.
MR. STEWART: Well, the FTC has consistently
taken this position. The Department of Justice, up
until 2009, we didn't endorse the scope of the patent
test. Indeed, in our invitation brief in Joblove we
specifically said that the scope-of-the-patent test
was -- didn't provide for enough scrutiny of these
settlements.
But what we advocated -- what the Department
of Justice advocated, instead was a test that would
focus on the strength and scope of the patent. That is,
the likelihood that the brand name would off --
ultimately have prevailed if the suit had been litigated
to judgment.
And in 2009, for the first time in an amicus
brief filed in the Second Circuit, we took essentially
the position that we're taking here, that is that
agreements of this sort should be treated as
presumptively unlawful with the presumption able to be
rebutted in various ways.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And one way is to assess
the validity or the strength of the infringement case?
MR. STEWART: We would say that that's not a
way, that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's -- that's my
concern, is your test is the same for a very weak patent
as a very strong patent. That doesn't make a lot of
sense.
MR. STEWART: Well, the test is whether
there has been a payment that would tend to skew the
parties' choice of an entry date, that would tend to
provide an incentive for the parties to -- for the
generic to agree to an entry date later than the one
that it would otherwise insist on.
Now, it probably is the case that our test
would have greater practical import in cases where the
parties perceive the patent to be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why wouldn't that
determination itself reflect the strength or weakness of
the patent so that the market forces take that into
account?
MR. STEWART: Well, I think in the kind of
settlement that we would regard as legitimate, where the
parties simply agree to a compromise date of generic
entry, then the parties would certainly take into
account their own assessment of what would likely happen
at the end of the suit.
And so if the parties believe that the brand
name was likely to prevail, then if the brand name
agreed to early generic entry at all, it would
presumably be for a fairly small amount of time.
Conversely, if the parties collectively
believe that the generic -- that the brand name had a
weak case and the generic was likely to prevail, then
they would negotiate for an earlier date. And the
problem with the reverse payment is that it gives the
generic an incentive to accept something other than
competition as a means of earning money.
I mean, to take another --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this was not a
problem, I gather, until the Hatch-Waxman amendments?
MR. STEWART: These suits -- these types of
payments appear to be essentially unknown in other
lawsuits and in other patent infringement cases.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and so -- and so do
suits against this kind of payment. And I have -- I
have the feeling that what happened is that Hatch-Waxman
made a mistake. It did not foresee that it would
produce this kind of -- this kind of payment.
And in order to rectify the mistake, the FTC
comes in and brings in a new interpretation of antitrust
law that did not exist before, just to make up for the
mistake that Hatch-Waxman made, even though Congress has
tried to cover its tracks in later amendments, right,
which -- which deter these, these -- these payments.
MR. STEWART: Congress has tried to reduce
the incentives for these payments to be made. I mean --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So why should we overturn
understood antitrust laws just to -- just to patch up a
mistake that Hatch-Waxman made?
MR. STEWART: Well, a couple things I would
say. First, I don't think we're -- we're not asking you
to overturn established antitrust laws. To take another
analogy, for example, if Watson instead of developing a
generic equivalent to AndroGel, had developed an
entirely new drug that it believed would be better than
AndroGel for the same conditions and if Solvay had paid
Watson not to seek FDA approval and not to seek -- to
market the drug, I think everyone would agree that that
was a per se antitrust violation, even though Watson's
ultimate ability to market the new drug would depend on
FDA approval that might or might not be granted.
And so when we say it's unlawful to buy off
uncertain competition, it's unlawful to buy off
competition, even when the competition might have been
prevented by other means, we are just enforcing standard
antitrust principles.
To focus on the distinction between
Hatch-Waxman and other patent litigation, Professor
Hovenkamp's conclusion is that the reason that you don't
see payments like this in the normal patent infringement
suit is that in the typical market if a patent holder
were known to have paid a large sum of money to a
competitor who had been making a challenge to the
patent, if other competitors knew that that had
happened, then they would perceive that to be a sign
that the patent was weak and that they would leap in.
But he says Hatch-Waxman makes it more
difficult for that to be done because Hatch-Waxman gives
unique incentives to the first paragraph 4 filer.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the 18 -- the
18-month rule primarily?
MR. STEWART: It's a 180-day period of
exclusivity.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. I mean 180 days,
yes.
MR. STEWART: Yes, and the way it works is
that the exclusivity period is not good in and of itself
for consumers. That is, during the period when one
generic is on the market and the others are not yet
allowed to compete, you have essentially duopoly
conditions, the price of the -- the drug drops but only
by a little bit.
Congress granted the 180-day exclusivity
period because it wanted generics to have ample
incentives to challenge patents that were perceived to
be weak.
And if the first filer is able to essentially
to be bought off, is able to set settle for something
other than early entry into the marketplace, then other
potential competitors face barriers to entry that
they -- similarly situated competitors wouldn't face in
other industries.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that just seems --
that's rather thin, I think. I don't know how -- I don't
have the ability to assess that and the significance of
it, empirically. The thing I wonder, therefore, you said
this is common in antitrust?
I'm -- I'm not up to everything in the
field, but I know there's an existence of something
called a per se rule, let's price fix it.
I know there's a rule of reason, and I know
there's a sort of vague area that sometimes in some
cases that Justice Souter mentioned in California
Dental, there is something slightly in between, which as
I saw those cases, they're very much like price fixing
or -- or agreements not to enter.
And what they seem to say is, Judge, pay
attention to the department when it says that these are
very often can be anticompetitive, and ask the defendant
why he's doing it.
I mean, is that what you want us to say? It
didn't seem as if in your briefs as if you were. Either
you were asking us to produce some kind of structure –-
I don't mean to be pejorative, but it's rigid -- a whole
set of complex per se burden of proof rules that I have
never seen in other antitrust cases, I -- my question is,
when I say I've never seen anything like this before in
terms of procedure, I want you to refer me to a case that
will show, oh, no, I'm out of date.
MR. STEWART: Well, the -- the Court has
recognized such a thing as the quick look approach, but
I think even though the case didn't use the term "quick
look," I don't believe it did, NCAA v. Regents of
University of Oklahoma is probably the best example,
where the --
JUSTICE BREYER: And are there others?
MR. STEWART: Well, that's the -- that's the
one I'm most familiar with.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any other? Are
you familiar with any other? Because I want to be sure
I read all of them.
MR. STEWART: I'll need to look back and see
what --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if there are few or
none, then I would say, why isn't the government
satisfied with an opinion of this Court that says, yes,
there can be serious anticompetitive effects. Yes,
sometimes there are business justifications, so Judge,
keep that in mind. Ask him why he has this agreement,
ask him what his justification is, and see if there's a
less restrictive alternative.
In other words, it's up to the district
court, as in many complex cases, to structure their case
with advice from the attorneys.
MR. STEWART: I think that would leave
courts without guidance as to --
JUSTICE BREYER: Without guidance?
MR. STEWART: -- without guidance as to what
factors would be appropriate --
JUSTICE BREYER: The same thing is
appropriate as is appropriate in any antitrust case.
Are there anticompetitive effects?
I have 32 briefs here that explain very
clearly what you said in a sentence. It may be that
they're simply dividing the monopoly profit. I
understand that -- you know, I can take that in and so
can every judge in the country. And what's complicated
about that.
And then I have some very nice dark green
briefs that clearly say, four instances, maybe five,
where there would be offsetting justifications. I think
they can get that, too.
MR. STEWART: Well, certainly our proposed
approach accounts for that. It provides -- it provides
really two different forms of rebuttal. First our
approach says, this is on its face an agreement not to
compete, the generic has agreed to stay out of the
market for a defined period of time, and the payment
gives rise to an inference that the agree -- that the
delay that the generic has agreed to is longer than the
period that would otherwise reflect its best assessment
of its likelihood of -- of success in the lawsuit.
But then we say, there are basically two
different types of ways in which the presumption could
be rebutted. First, the parties can show that the
payment was not in consideration for delay, that there
was some other commensurate value transferred, and the
payment -- and that arrangement would have been entered
into even without the larger settlement.
And then second, we're at least accepting
the possibility that brand names and generics could come
in and say, even though our payment was for delay, even
though we can't identify anything else that the payment
could have been consideration for, it's still, quote,
"competitive" under --
JUSTICE BREYER: And they mention at least
two others. The first one they mention is because the
person's already in the market thinks that the next year
or two or three years is worth $100 million a year, and
the person who's suing thinks it's worth 30 million a
year. And so he says, hey, I have a great idea, I'll
give him the 30 million and keep the 70. And -- and
that, I don't see why that's anticompetitive if that's
what's going on.
And the second instance they bring up is
that it's very hard to break into a market. So for the
new generic to come in, he's thinking, giving me two
years isn't worth much because I'll spend a lot of
money, it's very hard for me to do it. But the
defendant -- the defendant who wants this patent kept
intact says, I will not only let -- I'll let you in a
year earlier and I'll give you enough money so that you
can start up a distribution system. The second seems
procompetitive, the first, neutral.
The problem of deciding whether other
matters are or are not really payments for something
else, a true nightmare when you start talking about five
drugs and different distribution systems and the matter
of whether you're paying for litigation costs, a matter
of great debate for the judge. Okay, that's the
arguments that they make. Go ahead.
MR. STEWART: Let me say a couple of things
about the administrative nightmare. The first is that
to the extent that these inquiries are difficult,
they're difficult only by -- because the brand names and
the generics have made them difficult by tacking on
additional transactions to their settlement proposal.
And to take an analogy, there are government
ethics rules that say that -- what are called prohibited
sources. Basically, people who have business before the
department can't give me gifts as a government employee.
Now, obviously, it would be absurd to have a rule that
said a prohibited source couldn't give me a Rolex watch,
but could sell me a Rolex watch for a dollar. And so
the ethics rules treat as a gift an exchange for value
in which fair market value is not paid.
And everybody understands that once you go
down that route, occasionally, you will have hard cases
in which people could legitimately agree, was this a
legitimate arm's length exchange or was it a concealed
gift? But the prospect of those difficult cases doesn't
mean that we get rid of a gift ban altogether.
And certainly, Federal employees couldn't
bring the -- the ethics office to its knees by engaging
in such a proliferation of these side deals that the
ethics office decided it's not worth it.
The second thing is that Respondent's
approach would apply even when there are no hard
questions. Respondents would say that even if the
agreement provides for delayed generic entry until the
date the patent expires, and even if the only other term
of the agreement is the brand name pays the generic a
lot of money, that that would be a legitimate agreement
because the restriction would apply to arguably patented
drugs and it wouldn't extend beyond the date of patent
expiration.
I guess the -- the other thing I would say
about the way in which these payments can facilitate
settlement really shows their anticompetitive potential.
That is, suppose that the parties were negotiating for a
compromise date of entry, but they couldn't agree.
The -- the brand name said beginning of 2017 is the
earliest we'll let you in and the generic said beginning
of 2015 is the latest date that we would accept.
Now, the Respondents use the term "bridge
the gap," but there's obviously no way that a payment
from the brand name to the generic could enable the
parties to agree on an entry date between 2015 and 2017.
The brand name is never going to say, well,
I would insist on holding out until 2017, but if I'm
going to pay you a whole lot of money, then I'll let you
in earlier and accept a -- a diminution of your profits.
The brand name is going to say, if I pay you money, I'm
going to insist on deferring entry even later than the
2017 date that would otherwise be my preferred
compromise.
So the natural effect of these payments is
not to facilitate a -- a bridging the gap in the sense
of a picking of a point between the dates that the
parties would otherwise insist on. It is going -- it is
very likely to cause the parties to agree to an entry
date that's even later than the one the brand name would
otherwise find acceptable.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Stewart, can we go
back to Justice Breyer's question -- initial question.
It's rare that we find a per se antitrust violation.
Most situations we put it into rule of reason.
You seem to be arguing that this is price
fixing, a reverse payment like price fixing so that it
has to fall into something greater than the rule of
reason.
MR. STEWART: Not -- not price fixing, but
it's -- it's an agreement not to compete. That is, the
parties are not agreeing as to the prices they will
charge. The generic is agreeing to stay off the market
first. But that would be treated as per se --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why is the rule of
reason so bad? As an -- and that's really my bottom
line because you're creating all -- I think that's what
Justice Breyer was saying. I mean, for -- for example,
I have difficult under -- understanding why the mere
existence of a reverse payment is presumptively gives --
changes the burden from the Plaintiff.
It would seem to me that you’d have to bear
the burden -- the burden of proving that the payment for
services or the value given was too high. I don't know
why it has to shift to the other side.
MR. STEWART: Now, if you wanted to tweak
the theory in that way and to say that in cases where
there is not just a payment and an agreement on the date
of market entry, but there is additional consideration
exchanged beside, if you wanted to say that the
Plaintiff would bear the burden of showing that this was
not a fair exchange for value. That -- that's not
something we would agree with, but that would be a
fairly minor tweak to our theory.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So answer the more
fundamental question, why is the rule of reason so bad?
MR. STEWART: The rule -- I mean, it's bad
for reasons both of administrability and it's bad
conceptually. The reason it's bad for reasons of
administrability is that -- at least I take what you are
proposing to be that the antitrust court would consider
all the factors that might bear on the assessment of the
agreement, that those would include presumably the
strength of the patent claim, the subjective --
JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. I mean, Professor
Areeda, who is at least in my mind a minor deity in the
matter, in this area, if not major, he explains it. He
says don't try for more precision than you can get.
The quality of proof required should vary with the
circumstances.
Do you know how long it took -- I mean, and
I -- of course, I -- I know a little bit of antitrust.
But I mean, I think -- do you know how long it takes to
take in your basic argument that these sometimes can be
a division of profit, monopoly profit?  It takes
probably 3 minutes or less. And judges can do that.
So you say to the judge, Judge, this is
what's relevant here. And there's a rule of evidence,
don't waste the jury's time.
So -- so you shape the case as -- and this
is what goes -- used to go on for 40 years. You shape
the case in light of the considerations that are
actually relevant, useful, and provable in respect to
that case. And district judges, that's their job.
So -- so what -- I'm not saying you lose the case.
They didn't side with the Eleventh Circuit. They said
there's no violation, okay?
I've got your point on that. But -- but I'm
worried about creating some kind of administrative
monster.
MR. STEWART: It's not atypical -- I mean --
and the Court did this in NCAA, for example, where it
said that the agreement it was looking at, which dealt
with the allegation of -- of -- allocation of rights to
televised football games was essentially a limitation on
output, and the Court said those are presumptively
unlawful. Long experience in the market has shown that
they are suspect.
The Court didn't say there was long
experience in the market for television rights to
football. It just said output limitations have been
established as disfavored.
Nevertheless, because competitive sports by
nature require a degree of cooperation between the
people who compete against each other -- to establish
the rules of the game and so forth -- we will look to
see whether the parties have identified -- whether the
defendants have identified anything about their specific
industry that would justify our decision not to apply
the usual presumption, and it concluded that there was
nothing there.
And we're really asking the Court to take
the same approach here. We're saying payments not to
compete are generally disfavored. The parties can --
when you have a Hatch-Waxman settlement, in which money
is passing from the brand name to the generic, it's an
unusual settlement to begin with because there's no way
that the suit could have culminated in the generic
receiving a money judgment.
And therefore, we'll -- we'll look upon this
with suspicion, but we'll give the parties adequate
opportunities to -- to rebut.
If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of
my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Stewart.
Mr. Weinberger?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY I. WEINBERGER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WEINBERGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
I'd like to first respond to a question that
was asked of my friend by Justice Scalia a few minutes
ago. He was asked if there are any cases in which the
Court has ever found a restraint outside the scope of
the patent to be unlawful, and the answer to that
question is no.
That -- all of the cases that have found
violations of the antitrust laws based on a patent-based
restraint do so because the object of the agreement, the
restraint that's being achieved in the agreement, is
beyond the scope that could be legitimately achieved
with a patent.
For example, it's an attempt to control
downstream the resale prices of -- of products that you
cannot do simply by exercising your patent. Or it's an
attempt to control the sale of unpatented products that
go beyond what a patent can protect.
Every -- every case in which --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't this that?
Meaning there is no presumption of infringement.
There's no presumption that the item that someone else
is going to sell necessarily infringes.
MR. WEINBERGER: That's correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what you're
arguing is that in fact a settlement of an infringement
action is now creating that presumption.
MR. WEINBERGER: No, Justice Sotomayor, I'm
not arguing that. But -- but I do want to say that I
think our patent system depends upon the notion that you
don't evaluate from the anti -- the perspective of the
antitrust laws a patent restraint based upon whether you
could have proved in a litigation that that patent --
that the patent was infringed.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know, but I
don't know why we would be required to accept that there
has or would be infringement by the product that has
voluntarily decided not to pursue its rights.
MR. WEINBERGER: I think you're
not -- you're not accepting infringement. What you're
doing is recognizing there's a reasonable basis to
assert the patent, a bona fide, reasonable dispute, and
the parties have the ability to settle the dispute.
Just as if the party -- if someone was
entering into a license agreement with -- with someone
who had a product that they claimed did not infringe the
patent, they sat down, negotiated a license and resolved
it --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there, you know
that they're not sharing the profits.
MR. WEINBERGER: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning there you know
that a -- a product's been licensed and the -- that's
normal. The infringer is now paying the other side
money to sell that product.
MR. WEINBERGER: But, Justice Sotomayor,
many other --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A reverse payment
suggests something different, that they're sharing
profits.
I don't know what else you can conclude.
MR. WEINBERGER: Many license -- I don't
think that's correct, and that's because many license
disputes are, in fact, resolved by the -- the alleged
infringer exiting the market for a period of time, or
agreeing to stay off until a certain time.
And then the license --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But not many for reverse
payments.
MR. WEINBERGER: Yes, they are because --
because, for example, it could be a license agreement
where the infringer agrees to stay off the market for X
number of years, and when it comes on it pays a certain
royalty.
Now, anybody could argue that that royalty,
if it were higher, could result in an earlier entry.
There's always an argument to be made with any delayed
entry situation that monopoly profits are shared.
That's just -- just inherent in the nature of it.
And if you take the FTC's argument to its
full force, it would mean that any situation where
anyone is agreeing to a delayed entry, and there's any
other value that's being exchanged in that situation,
that in effect in economic terms is a payment for
delayed entry. There's no difference.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. But there, it's
not -- their point is not it's per se unlawful. What
they want is they want to cut some kind of line between
a per se rule and the kitchen sink. And if you look at
the brief supporting you, it is the kitchen sink. You
have economists attacking the patent system or praising
it, da, da, da, and here and there and the other. They
don't want the kitchen sink.
Now, suppose I don't want the kitchen sink,
but I have a hard time saying what the per se rule is.
So what's your idea?
MR. WEINBERGER: I -- I've obviously given a
lot of thought to whether there is any kind of an
intermediary test that works and I don't believe there
is. Let me explain why.
First, you can't really measure whether
there were any anticompetitive effects from such a
settlement agreement without determining what would have
happened if the case hadn't settled and it would have
been litigated. And if the patentee had won the
litigation, then there would be no anticompetitive
effects.
That's what the Second Circuit and the
Federal Circuit concluded in applying the rule of reason
test, and saying the first condition of such a test has
not been met because there's no demonstration of
anticompetitive effects.
And the cases -- both of those cases are
very good illustrations of what I'm talking about.
Those were the Tamoxifen and Cipro cases, where the
parties agreed to so-called reverse payment settlements
that FTC would say are basically per se lawful.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it -- would it help
if you were -- were thinking about rules and caps, to
consider not what the branded company would have --
would have made, but what the generic company would have
lost? And -- and use the latter as the limit?
MR. WEINBERGER: Well, you really don't know
unless you can assume when they could have entered --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you -- you have to
make an extrapolation, yes.
MR. WEINBERGER: Well, because it all
depends on what would have happened in the patent
litigation. So that you can't really tell whether
there's any anticompetitive effect.
I should also say with respect to the
generic losing, there's really no risk for the generic
here, which is one of the reasons you see these
settlements, that in this industry --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if the generic wins,
though, its -- everybody's profits are lower. And you
can gear it to just what the -- what the generic would
have made.
MR. WEINBERGER: They're -- they're lower
than they would be under some other situation, but --
but the patent gave the patent holder the legal right to
exclude. And so unless there's a reason, there's some
reason to believe that it couldn't reasonably assert
that patent, it's entitled to monopoly profits for the
whole duration of the patent.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Weinberger, can I just
understand what you're saying, and maybe do it through a
hypothetical.
MR. WEINBERGER: Certainly.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose you had a -- a
lawsuit and the generic sends the brand name
manufacturer an e-mail and the e-mail says, we have this
lawsuit, I think I have about a 50 percent chance of
winning.
If I win, I take your -- your monopoly
profits down from 100 million to $10 million. Wouldn't
it be a good thing if you just gave me 25 million?
Alright? And then the brand name sends an e-mail back,
says -- you know, that seems like a pretty good idea, so
I'll give you 25 million.
Now, as I understand it, your argument is, I
mean, that's just fine. That's hunky dory.
MR. WEINBERGER: Well, what I'm saying is
that in -- in any given situation --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Is that fine?
MR. WEINBERGER: I -- I think that if the --
if it's a single situation and the evidence is that
there's a reasonable basis to assert that patent and in
truth, the patent had what you say is a 50/50 chance
of prevailing, then I think that there could be a
settlement like that, if it's in good faith.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Even though -- but what does
that mean in good faith? It's clear what's going on here
is that they're splitting monopoly profits and the
person who's going to be injured are all the consumers
out there.
MR. WEINBERGER: Any -- any situation in
which there's any -- in any patent dispute in which
there's a tradeoff, like the examples I mentioned
before, time for value, could -- that argument could be
made.
And, in fact, if that was true, if it was
true that the natural inference and the motivations of
people were simply to divide these profits with no
other consideration, then what you'd expect to see is
that every single patent dispute, would, especially in
Hatch-Waxman, would result in a settlement that just
pays the generic until the end of the patent because
after all, the market would be --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Weinberger, I
think if we give you the rule that you're suggesting we
give you, that is going to be the outcome because this
is going to be the incentive of both the generic and the
brand name manufacturer in every single case is to split
monopoly profits in this way to the detriment of all
consumers.
MR. WEINBERGER: Let me address that, Your
Honor. I don't think that's realistic at all because --
and let's take this industry specifically, that the
ability to challenge a patent in this industry is lower
than any industry that I can think of, and that's
because a generic is given the right to certify against
the patent and then basically challenge the patent
without having actually developed the product, gotten a
marketing force, gotten a factory, putting the product
on sale and taking the risk that everyone else who
challenges a patent has to take.
All they have to do is -- is file an ANDA,
which is roughly 300,000 to $1 million for these size
drugs, that's not a lot, and certify it. And the FTC's
own studies have shown that it takes a very small chance
of winning, something like 4 percent for a drug over
$130 billion to justify a generic suing a brand name
company.
And what happens -- so what happens in these
cases --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that in all cases or
just Hatch-Waxman cases?
MR. WEINBERGER: It's Hatch-Waxman cases.
It's because of --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because it does skew the
dynamics a lot.
MR. WEINBERGER: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You know, the Second
Circuit recognized, even though it accepted your scope
of the patent, that there was a troubling dynamic in
what you're arguing, which is that the less sound the
patent, the more you're going to hurt consumers because
those are the cases where the payoff, the sharing of
profits is the greatest inducement for the patent holder.
MR. WEINBERGER: The Second Circuit
recognized that, but then they said further -- on
further reflection, on further consideration of this, we
are not troubled by it.
And one of the reasons they were not troubled,
it's what I was trying to answer Justice Kagan about, is
because the reality of the situation is with so many
potential challengers to the patent, all they have to do
is file an ANDA, there are 200 generic companies in this
industry, that if you try to adopt that strategy of
paying the profits of a generic, there's going to be a
long line of --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Suppose --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I don't think that
that's true, Mr. Weinberger, and it's because of
something that Justice Scalia suggested, that there's a
kind of glitch in Hatch-Waxman. And the glitch is that
the 180 days goes to the first filer.
And once the 180-day first filer is bought
off, nobody else has the incentive to do this.
MR. WEINBERGER: That's clearly not correct
either by logic or by reference to actual experience.
It's true that the first filer is given a greater
incentive, but these products can last for 20 or
25 years.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But the -- the huge
percentage of the profits is done in the exclusivity
period. I mean, it's true that it can go on for a long
time, but you're making dribs and drabs of money for a
long time. Where you're really making your money is in
the 180 days.
MR. WEINBERGER: Experience doesn't show
that because if you look at Hatch-Waxman litigation,
we've cited in -- in the red brief and it's been
discussed by the antitrust economists and the Generic
Pharmaceutical Association in their amicus brief, that
many of these Hatch-Waxman cases involve multiple
filers.
You have 5, 10, as many as 16 companies
challenging these patents, all of -- one of whom are not
the first filer. So there -- there must be an incentive
for them to do this, and -- and they are. So I think
experience says that that kind of extreme view of
incentives is not really true.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what do we look at
to verify what you say? Is that -- is that all in the
briefs?
MR. WEINBERGER: Yes, it's in the -- in the
Solvay brief. I don't have the page --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I had thought, as
Justice Kagan's question might indicate, that the
180 days is crucial, it allows you to go to the doctors,
to give them the name of your generic equivalent, et
cetera, and that that's a big advantage.
MR. WEINBERGER: It's a big advantage --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And now, you're -- now,
you're indicating that it isn't.
MR. WEINBERGER: It's a big advantage. It's
an incentive for the first six months, I don't debate
that, but after that, the market opens up.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Suppose -- this
sounds like an argument, a discussion that you’d have in
the district court, so -- so why -- what's your reaction
to this. Say A, sometimes these settlements can be very
anticompetitive, dividing monopoly profit. In deciding
whether anticompetitive outweighs business practices
without less restrictive alternatives, judge, you may
take that into account. Two, do not take into account
the strength of a patent. Three, do not try to
relitigate the patent.
Four, there are several possible
justifications, ones I listed before out of the briefs,
litigation costs -- the other products, different
assessments of -- of value. Five, there could be, in
fact, no anticompetitive effect here because of what you
just said now in response to Justice Kennedy and Justice
Kagan, but there could be. We don't know. Okay?
So start with where we were. Could be
anticompetitive. Give the defense a chance to go
through five, one through five, and if they convince you
there is a six, we're not saying there isn't, but we
can't think of one on the briefs, let them have the
sixth, too. Okay? Now, judge, weigh and decide.
That's what we do. So we've structured it somewhat to
keep the kitchen sink out on the basis of the briefs
given to us. What's wrong with that?
MR. WEINBERGER: Well, I think the first
problem with it is that it's -- it's very unpredictable.
It's really hard to figure out how that all gets sorted
out, and the parties who are sitting down to do a
settlement need, I feel, much clearer guidance --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't -- you can't
possibly figure it out, can you, without assessing the
strength of the patent?
MR. WEINBERGER:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
the conclusion?
MR. WEINBERGER:
only thing that brought --
JUSTICE SCALIA:
That's right.
Isn't that crucial to -- to
I -- I believe that the
And to say you can consider
every other factor other than the strength of the patent
is -- is to leave -- leave out the -- the elephant in
the room.
MR. WEINBERGER: I agree with that,
Justice Scalia. I don't think that an alternative
test -- the only alternative test that could be
fashioned that would -- that would make sense is one
based on strength of the patent.
But there are so many reasons that that is
an undesirable result that I -- I don't think it's the
way this Court should go.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For whom? And -- and --
you know, the government is basically saying, we really
don't want reverse payments, period. We want people to
settle this the way they should settle it, which is on
the strength of the patent. And that means settling it
simply by either paying a royalty for use or settling as
most cases do, on an early entry alone, so there's no
sharing of -- of -- of profits. What's so bad about
that?
I mean, it doesn't deprive either side of
the ability to finish the litigation if they want to.
MR. WEINBERGER: Let's say -- I wouldn't
concede that most cases settle like that. But let's --
let's accept that and take the case of a -- of a strong
patent or a patent with a long term. Let's say
it has -- you evaluate the strength of the patent and
you conclude that it has 10 or 15 good years remaining.
Now, you have a generic who is -- or many
generics who have sued with no risk or minimal risk in
Hatch-Waxman, and their response is, why would I -- why
would I drop this lawsuit to get an entry date in 2025
or 2028? That doesn't meet my business needs, I have
shareholders, I have investors, I have to run a
business, and I'm going to keep on litigating unless you
give me something of value.
So that's what these agreements are about.
They're saying, well, what other -- remember, this is
not just a cash payment. There are all --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, in the normal
course, if the patent's really strong, if you get a year
or two earlier entry, that has an inherent value, and
that's what you'll pay for is what the government is
saying. That will be the determination the two parties
will make, which is at what point is earlier entry worth
it --
MR. KATZ: But, first of all --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- for the very strong
patent holder.
MR. WEINBERGER: But first of all, parties
often don't agree on the merits. Parties tend to be
overconfident. They both think they are going to win.
So it's sometimes very hard to come to a consensus where
entry date is the only bargaining chip available.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, they pointed to
most settlements and say that is the vast majority.
MR. WEINBERGER: I don't know where the
evidence would be for that. I don't think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, we do know that
these reverse payments, except for recent times when
people figured out they were so valuable, were the
exception, not the rule.
MR. WEINBERGER: Actually, we have ten years
of experience since the circuit courts first began
applying scope-of-the-patent tests to these settlements
since 2003. So we have a pretty good window as to what
would happen.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They have been
increasing in number, not decreasing.
MR. WEINBERGER: No, I think they have been
actually very steady. They are roughly between 25 and
30 percent, pretty much constant and you don't really
see any huge blips depending on what a particular court
is ruling.
If the FTC's kind of
the-sky-is-going-to-fall approach is right, that
everybody's going to run out and do this, you would have
thought that after the first Eleventh Circuit ruling,
after the Federal Circuit ruling, after the Second
Circuit ruling, after second Eleventh Circuit ruling,
that there would be huge increases in this, but we
haven't seen that.
Some of the numbers increased last year, but
as a percentage of the total settlements they are very
steady. They are pretty much the same.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the
consideration that seems to be driving the government?
That is, the generic is getting an offer that they would
never get on the street. I mean, they are being paid
much more than they would get if they won the patent
infringement suit.
If they won the patent infringement suit,
then they can sell their generic in competition with the
brand. But under this agreement they get more than they
would get by winning the lawsuit.
MR. WEINBERGER: Justice Ginsburg, first of
all, every settlement agreement involving one of these
cases must be filed with the FTC. They have hundreds of
them. And they haven't pointed to a single example
where that's the case.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But it's just an economic --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose -- suppose
that hypothetical is correct. That's what was my
concern, too. What the brand company can lose is much
greater than what the generic can make. So why don't
you just put a cap on what the generic can make and then
we won't have a real concern with the restraint of trade,
or we'll have a lesser concern. I think that's the
thrust of Justice Ginsburg's question and it's my
concern as well.
MR. WEINBERGER: Yes, and I want to make
clear that I don't think that could happen because if a
brand name company adopted that as a strategy to protect
its patent, it would -- it would be held up. It would
be held up by the many generic companies that could
easily challenge these patents without actually having a
manufactured product, without putting it on sale, et
cetera.
So I think that the antitrust rule should
not be fashioned to deal with a case on the extreme,
which hasn't been shown to happen, which logically from
an economic point of view is highly unlikely to happen.
And if for some reason that starts happening
empirically, then Congress -- and it is a loophole in
Hatch-Waxman that is causing that, and there is really
no evidence that that extreme example has happened --
then Congress can deal with it, just as it dealt with
the exclusivity provision.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the government
was telling us that that's this case, that the -- what
the generic is being offered in the way of sharing the
monopoly profits is more than it could ever make if it
wanted to and sold its drug.
MR. WEINBERGER: Well, I don't see any
examples of that cited in their brief. It's a theory,
it's a hypothetical theory, but there is no data. And
we have had years of experience with this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it's not
hypothetical that if the generic wins everybody -- the
brand companies’ profits are going to go way, way down
right away and generic profits are not going to be that
great.
MR. WEINBERGER: Of course. I think that's
true in many -- many patent litigations.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but so then the
question still holds. If you -- if you key your payment
to what the brand company will make, it's just a much
higher figure, and a greater danger of unreasonable
restraint.
MR. WEINBERGER: There is that hypothetical
risk. What I'm -- I am trying to make the point that
it's not -- with the number of challenges you have here,
which is basically unlimited, that if you put a sign
around your neck that says, paying off all generic
companies their profits, whoever wants to challenge my
patent come do it, there is going to be a long line of
people, of companies doing it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay, I will grant you
that point that the 180 days is not that big a
difference, and that there are many generics out there.
But isn't that true in every industry? You said at the
outset, oh, well, now in the drug industry there are a
lot of people ready to pounce in. Isn't that true in
any industry?
MR. WEINBERGER: It is true and that's why
it doesn't happen. It's -- it's more true here because
it's much easier to challenge a patent. So in any other
industry a potential challenger has to make a major
investment in a product, has to get it manufactured, has
to put it on sale, and then litigate. And if they lose,
they are going to be liable for enormous damages.
That's not the case under Hatch-Waxman. All
they need to do is file an ANDA. They have nothing at
risk. If they lose, they haven't lost any damages.
They just walk away. So there is an enormous difference
in the risks between Hatch-Waxman and other cases that
explains the particular form of some of these
settlements and why they happen.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see that as an
argument that there is an economic reality in
Hatch-Waxman that would require us not to apply any rule
we choose or accept here to other situations, only here.
That's the argument that you're creating for me, that
there's a different economic reality here that requires
a different rule.
MR. WEINBERGER: Justice Sotomayor, I think
the economic reality cuts the other way. It doesn't cut
in favor of making a rule that makes these more
difficult. What I'm saying is that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, but it does because
in Hatch-Waxman Congress decided that there was a
benefit for generics entering without suffering a
potential loss to enter the market more quickly.
MR. WEINBERGER: Justice Sotomayor, I don't
think the legislation --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And any settlement in
these cases deprives consumers of the potential of
having the benefit of an earlier entry.
MR. WEINBERGER: I don't believe there is
anything in Hatch-Waxman that supports the idea that the
purpose was to provide for generic entry prior to patent
expiration. What the structure is designed to do is
encourage challenges because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly, and what you
are doing with permitting settlements of this kind is
not permitting the process to go to conclusion.
MR. WEINBERGER: I don't think there is
anything in Hatch-Waxman that suggests, in any way, that
settlements or -- should be discouraged or that cases
should be mandated to proceed to judgment or that all
have to be litigated.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's encouraging
infringement suits.
MR. WEINBERGER: It's encouraging challenges
and it has produced many challenges. And I can say --
can I say that with 10 years of the application of the
scope-of-the-patent rule, there is no particular problem
with Hatch-Waxman. It's working very well. The
amount -- the number of drugs that have now gone generic
from just ten years ago to today has increased
enormously.
JUSTICE BREYER: So why does it help you to
say, if the Court says or the FTC says when you get one
of these suits you can settle it by letting them in, but
you can't pay them money. That that will help to stop
strike suits if it costs them nothing to get in. They
have to really want to enter or they won't bring
lawsuits. So why does that hurt you?
MR. WEINBERGER: Well, I actually think that
you raise a point that the generic -- in some of the
amicus briefs, some of the generic parties have talked
about, which is that their ability to challenge these
cases depends on their not having to litigate every one
of them to conclusion. And that's not bad because most
patent cases settle. Most -- most of these disputes
settle. And if our system was one in which every case
had to be litigated fully to judgment, it -- we would be
unable to cope with that.
So -- so what I think the statute mandates
or contemplates is that generics should be able to
challenge, and should have strong incentive to
challenge, but that doesn't mean that they should be
required to litigate to conclusion. And if settlement
is made more difficult, so that different perceptions or
different business objectives can't be bridged with some
kind of a business settlement, that is going to mean
that fewer generics are going to challenge these patents
and that is contrary to the purpose of the Hatch-Waxman
Act.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it's correct that
to develop a new drug sometimes you need not just
scientists and attorneys, you need investment bankers.
And you then need marketers because the cost of these
drugs can be hundreds of millions. Is there anything in
the record that shows the development cost of this drug?
MR. WEINBERGER: This particular drug, I
don't know. I mean, there are lots of studies on how
much average drugs cost, and that figure is over a
billion dollars.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It can be a billion.
MR. WEINBERGER: Easily a billion dollars.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Anything in this case?
MR. WEINBERGER: This particular drug --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Anything in the record?
MR. WEINBERGER: No, because we are on a
(b)(6) motion on a motion to dismiss, so none of that
was really developed, but --
JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry.
MR. WEINBERGER: But I was just going to say
that the -- of course, any given drug development cost
doesn't even begin to tell the picture because for every
drug that succeeds, there are at least 10 that fail, and
all the costs that are involved in the drugs that fail
have to be covered with the one drug that succeeds.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I just make sure I
understand the way the 180-day period worked? The first
filer gets it, if I buy off -- if I'm a brand name
manufacturer and I buy off the first filer with one of
these reverse payments, you're suggesting that that's
not going to do me much good because they're all going
to be -- there's going to be a long line. And that long
line of people, it's not just that they don't get the
180-day period, it's like even if one of those people
wins, the person whom I've paid off is going to get the
180-day exclusivity period, isn't that right?
MR. WEINBERGER: Not completely. First of
all, it depends on the -- the agreement. For example,
in this case, that 180-day exclusivity was waived.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But if it's not waived by
the parties, in other words, it's not just like I don't
get it so my incentives go down. It's that my
competitor gets it. So why in the world am I standing
in line to -- to challenge this if my competitor is
going to get the exclusive period?
MR. WEINBERGER: This was the exact problem
that Congress addressed in 2003, when it amended
Hatch-Waxman and changed the exclusivity requirements.
So the way the law now reads is that subsequent
generics, subsequent filers can trigger that 180-day
exclusivity by continuing to litigate. So if the first
filer settles and these other folks are in line and
they're litigating, they can force that period to start
running and then they can come in right after. So it is
not correct that you can tie up the first filer in
settlement and prevent everybody else from entering.
And even before that amendment, the Eleventh
Circuit, Federal circuit in the Second, applying the
scope of the patent rule recognized that if the
agreement creates a bottleneck to other filers that goes
beyond what the statutory exclusivity provides, where
they agree not to give up their exclusivity or agree to
retain it, then that's beyond the scope of the patent.
Because you can't achieve that kind of a restraint
simply -- with a patent, you -- you're using the
agreement to expand upon your patent rights to block
other filers.
So I think that problem's been addressed by
Congress. And if somebody feels that solution's not
perfect and they want to make it even easier for
subsequent filers to come in, then I submit that
Congress can do that. That they --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what was the change
that was made?
MR. WEINBERGER: The change that was made,
Justice Ginsburg, is that -- there were a number of
changes, but the one that's relevant here is that if
a -- if a subsequent filer -- strike that.
You can trigger the exclusivity beginning to
run by getting the judgment. So in the past, if a first
filer settled and they just didn't do anything -- may I
finish the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, certainly.
MR. WEINBERGER: And they just didn't do
anything, that would prevent other generics from coming
to market. But now anybody else who's litigating this
patent, if they go ahead and win their case, then
that -- that triggers the first filer's rights and if
they don't exercise that -- those rights within 75 days,
they're gone, they're forfeited. So that's the change.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. WEINBERGER: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Stewart, you
have five minutes remaining.
MR. WEINBERGER: Thank you, Your Honor.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STEWART: Thank you.
Mr. Weinberger argued that in order to
determine whether a settlement of this sort has
anticompetitive effects, we would have to know how the
lawsuit would have turned out, but it's perhaps the most
fundamental principle of antitrust law that particular
conduct can be legal or illegal, depending on the
deliberative process that led up to it.
And to put that in concrete terms, if a
business charges a particular price for a particular
product because it's made the assessment that this will
maximize profits in a competitive environment, that
decision is almost immune from antitrust scrutiny. But
if the business charges the same price for the same
product in the same market because it's agreed with its
competitor that it will charge that price, that's a per
se antitrust violation.
So it's not at all anomalous to say that
this type of agreement can be deemed anticompetitive,
even though the same result, namely, exclusion of the
generic from the market might have been able to be
obtained by other means.
The second thing is, Mr. Weinberger said
there are instances in which second and successive
filers will attempt to challenge the brand name even
after the first filer has been bought off. I think
we -- we disagree that it's as easy as he would say it
is, but we'll concede it happens occasionally. But the
fact that particular anticompetitive conduct doesn't
always work doesn't make it lawful.
It could often happen that two firms were
thinking about entering into a price-fixing agreement,
for instance, but thought to themselves, if we do that,
there's a third competitor in the market who will be
able to undersell us, and this would make our agreement
unprofitable. And it might happen sometimes that two
firms try to proceed with a price-fixing conspiracy, but
they're thwarted because of the unexpected competition
from a third firm.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought Mr.
Weinberger's point was that this is always going to
happen because it's very easy -- as he said, you put a
sign on your neck saying, generics line up to get your
payment. That seems quite different than saying there's
another firm out there in the abstract that -- that
might want to enter into a similar market sharing
arrangement. This is a very different system.
MR. STEWART: I mean, first, there certainly
is no evidence suggesting that it has happened often,
although there is evidence that it has happened. But if
the brand name perceived on a systemic basis that the
likely result of paying off one competitor was that
another competitor would step in and couldn't be bought
off would litigate the suit to judgment, there would be
no incentive to make the reverse payment in the first
place.
That is, in making the reverse payment, what
the -- the brand name is attempting to purchase is
protection from the possibility that it will have its
patent invalidated, and it will suffer a large
competitive advantage. If a brand name thinks in a
particular instance there is somebody else who's going
to expose it to -- me to that risk, the -- the payment
wouldn't be expected to be made. So at least --
JUSTICE KAGAN: And what's your
understanding of why there would not be a long line in
some cases or in many cases?
MR. STEWART: I think for the reasons
that -- that your question suggested, that there is the
0-day exclusivity period and leaving aside the cases
in which that is waived, subsequent manufacturers would
realize not only that they wouldn't get that period of
heightened profits themselves, but they would have to
wait in line for others, and they might focus their
attention on other patents that were perceived to be
weak as to which they could hope to -- to get the
180-day exclusivity contract.
JUSTICE KAGAN: And is there anything to
show what I think Justice Kennedy asked -- you know, how
much of one's profits comes from the 180-day period as
opposed to what happens after that?
MR. STEWART: I know it is the great
majority, I don't have a percentage figure. And the
reason, as I indicated earlier, was that during the
0-day exclusivity period, you have only two
competitors. Basically, a biopoly arrangement. And my
understanding is that the generics would usually charge
around 80 to 85 percent of the brand name's price during
that period. And after there is full competition, the
price would drop to a fraction of that.
The next thing I would say is that our
system encourages settlement, but not to the nth degree.
And so for instance, if you had two -- two firms
fighting over a million dollars and each firm decided
internally, 600,000 is the least I will accept. If they
stuck to their guns, the case couldn't be settled.
Now, if the public could be made to kick in
an additional 200,000, then each of the firms could get
its 600,000 and walk away content. But we don't pursue
the policy in favor of settlement to that degree. But
that's essentially what's happening here. The -- the
way these payments facilitate settlement is by inducing
the generics to agree to a later entry date by
increasing the total pool of profits that are available
to the two firms combined and thereby maximizing the
likelihood that each firm will find its own share of the
profit satisfactory.
And the last thing I would say is I think
everyone who comes to this issue recognized that there
is a conundrum. Our natural instinct is to compare the
settlement to the expected outcome of litigation. But
everyone also recognizes that it just isn't feasible to
try the patent suit.
And, therefore, our approach focuses on
whether the competitive process has been preserved.
