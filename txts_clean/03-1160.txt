ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Stevens, and may it
please the Court:
Petitioners submit that the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act prohibits an employment practice that
has a significant disparate impact on older workers if
that practice lacks any reasonable business justification.
The ADEA embodies Congress' determination that
age discrimination seriously impedes older Americans'
ability to participate fairly in the American work force.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Goldstein, let me just
interrupt a minute. You say if it lacks the -- the
business justification. But is it not a part of -- that
is not a part of the plaintiffs' primary submission, is
it, that it does not show? That's an affirmative defense.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Stevens, there is not a
clear answer to that question in all candor. It is not
before the Court. I will tell you that the lower courts
uniformly in the ADEA disparate impact context apply
Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion in Watson and the
Wards Cove rule rather than the post-1991 Civil Rights Act
rule. That is a debatable proposition because, as your
question suggests, in subsection (f)(1) of the statute
where this provision comes from -- and let me just take us
to the language. It would probably be most useful. In
the blue book, the -- the blue petitioners' brief at page
are the relevant provisions.
(a)(2) we'll come back to. That's the parallel
language to Griggs.
The reasonable factor other than age provision
is (f)(1), and it says: it shall not be unlawful for an
-- this is at the bottom of the page. It shall not be
unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise
prohibited -- and I'm going to come back and focus on that
-- under subsection (a) where the differentiation is based
on reasonable factors other than age.
The fact that it says otherwise prohibited seems
to suggest that this is setting up an employer defense, as
your question indicates. And the Court in the -- the
Western Air Lines case in 1986 said that the BFOQ
provision, which is in (f)(1) as well, is an affirmative
defense. So I --
JUSTICE BREYER: You put your finger on exactly
what's the part of this case that's bothering me. Read
through the language. As you read through the language,
disparate impact does seem to be called for, and this
particular provision, reasonable factors other than age,
seems a defense to that, just as BFOQ is the defense to
disparate treatment. And that all seems to work.
But you read the definition of reasonable factor
other than age to mean business necessity or even Justice
O'Connor's opinion, which is pretty tough. It's hard for
an employer to make that defense. And while making it
hard to make that defense in the case of gender or race
discrimination, in fact works in my opinion perfectly
well. You start making it hard to make that defense here
and you're going to have a nightmare because every effort
by any employer to equalize to any degree pay or treatment
of his or her employees is going to have a disparate
impact in respect to age because the correlation with age
runs into all kinds of things that it doesn't in the other
cases.
So I can't believe that Congress really would
have wanted that, but the reason I can't believe it is
because I can't believe the business necessity part of it.
And so here I'm faced with a reg which, at one and the
same time, pulls in disparate impact and business
necessity, and now I don't know what to do.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: I can tell you.
(Laughter.)
MR. GOLDSTEIN: The answer is that you should
recognize, as does the commission, which has delegated
rulemaking authority under the act, that business
necessity, which is the term of art that they used in the
regulation -- and we'll come back to it. It's at page 2
of the blue brief -- means different things in different
contexts. And so I want to take you to the specific
citations where the EEOC has recognized the common sense
principle. We know that more things that are legitimate
employer practices correlate with age than they do with
race and gender. It is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, before you do
that, before you deal with the EEOC regulation, this
statute doesn't -- at least on -- on the page 1 part you
called our attention to, doesn't refer to business
necessity. That's in the EEOC regulation. If I were just
reading this statute cold, I'd say, yes, that looks like
an affirmative defense to me, but reasonable factor seems
like something quite different than necessity. It isn't
necessary for the business to do this, but it's
reasonable. And if that's -- then the business necessity
-- it seems to me, at least arguably, an improper
construction of this act, that the EEOC got it wrong when
it referred to business necessity. They were thinking of
Griggs and -- and title VII, but this statute says
reasonable factors.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Our position relies only
on the statute. We embrace the text of the statute.
(f)(1) says that the employer's conduct merely has to be
reasonable. We agree with that.
The point I would then take you to is that in --
if the Court were interested in the regulation -- we don't
think it's necessary to get to the regulation, but if it
were, the EEOC has said that it too recognizes that the
phrase, business necessity, in the context of the Age Act
does not mean essential to the business.
Let me tell you why it used the language it did,
business necessity, in the regulation just to clear it up.
And that is when this Court first used the words, business
necessity, in Griggs and then subsequently in Wards Cove,
it didn't have all the connotations that it does now as
being quite a high employer burden. If I could just read
to you two things from Griggs.
Griggs said, the touchstone is business
necessity. If the employment practice cannot be shown to
be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.
It simply required related to job performance. That's the
backdrop on which the EEOC used the word.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm not sure you're
right about that, Mr. Goldstein, because if you think of
what it was, it was a pen and paper test and it was a high
school diploma. Now, an employer might well think I want
to upgrade my work force. I want this to be a real classy
work force. So I'm going to require a high school
diploma. It isn't necessary, but why is it unreasonable
for me to do that? So I -- I don't -- I think Griggs
spoke about rules that were built in headwinds because a
large part of the population didn't have the opportunity
to get high school diplomas. That doesn't exist in the
age discrimination area. So I -- I don't think that
Griggs is an example of something that was a loose
business necessity rule.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: My point is only terminological,
and that is, when the EEOC used those words, it did not do
so against a backdrop in which they carried a connotation
that was necessarily very strict, and it has said several
times -- and they are quoted in our brief -- that the
standard -- and this is just the bottom line. I think
it's a very important bottom line.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't care about those regs
anyway. Right?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: We do care about the
regulations.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, you do. I thought you were
saying you could make your case just on the --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, we have --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- text of the statute.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: We can and will.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, maybe you should
because I'm not so sure that the EEOC interpretation is
entitled to Chevron deference.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: We do believe that it is
entitled to Chevron deference because they have delegated
rulemaking authority and there is some suggestion that the
because of language in subsection --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But was this an actual rule
after notice and comment, or is it a -- an interpretation?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is a post-notice and comment
rule.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but it interprets --
doesn't interpret the prohibitory section. I mean, it --
it might be understood as simply making an assumption
that, say, the Griggs rule would be applied in -- in this
Court.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's conceivable you could read
it that way, although the EEOC has specified many times,
in the quarter century since it enacted the regulation,
that no, when we -- and let me take us to the text to
explain why, and that again is at page 2 of the blue
brief. They said -- and this is the block quote. When an
employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a
basis for different treatment of employees or applicants
for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other
than age, and such practice has an adverse impact on
individuals. That's the reference to disparate impact.
The regulatory materials cite to Griggs.
But in all events, I do want to come back to the
bottom line, and that is the EEOC recognizes, we recognize
that it's easier to prove either a defense or to put the
burden on the plaintiff's case. It's a -- you have a
higher hurdle --
JUSTICE BREYER: Easier -- easier is a matter of
degree.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: And reasonable factor could be
interpreted to say what the employer -- but the employer
just doesn't like paying these executives so much money
when these new younger janitors make so little. And so he
says, I want to pay the new younger janitors more. Okay?
There we've got it. Disparate impact.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: And now you say, what's the
business necessity? And frankly, there wasn't one. It's
just that I found it sort of bad. All right? So there we
are. I've lost my case.
Now, that's what is worrying me, and I thought
perhaps this reg that seems to say -- and lower courts
have accepted that I would lose my case -- that this reg
is outside Congress' -- the agency's authority for that
reason because Congress couldn't have intended that
result.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, let me take you to the
lines of cases that I think might concern you. There were
a set of cases before this Court's decision in Hazen Paper
that involved two rules, Justice Breyer, and I will tell
you that you referred to in the Adams oral argument when
this case -- this issue came to you before. And so I want
to refer to a very specific set of cases.
There were a set of cases before 1993 in which
there was some correlation. High salary correlated with
age. And the courts of appeals, the Third -- the Second
Circuit in the Geller case and the Eighth Circuit in the
Leftwich case treated that as effectively a disparate
treatment -- disparate treatment case because of the high
level of correlation.
The more recent cases reject that result and we
embrace the more recent cases. And I want to cite them to
you so you could look them up if you wanted. The Evers
case, which is 241 F.3d 948; the Williams case, which is
2 F.Supp.2d 267; and the last one is Newport Mesa, 893
F.Supp 927. These cases recognized that cost is a
perfectly legitimate business justification, and they put a
single burden on the employer.
Now, let me just -- just to say, most impact
cases aren't cost cases, but I know it's a concern. They
say, look, if you want to cut your costs and get rid of
your more expensive work force, we're only going to ask
you to do one thing, and that is allow your more senior
workers to take a pay cut. They do not say, as did the
older cases, that it causes disparate impact and you lose
your case. And so we don't --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Goldstein, you -- this is
-- this case arises out of a compensation program of the
employer, and why is it brought under 4(a)(2) instead of
(a)(1) which addresses discrimination in compensation?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice O'Connor, the lower
courts unanimously conclude, as does the commission, that
(a)(2), although it does not have the word compensation in
it, does apply to compensation and --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But why in light of 4(a)(1)?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Because they understand 4(a) --
and let me take you -- everyone to the text just so we can
all be literally on the same page, and that is going to be
in the red brief at page 17a. It is 623(a), and it's the
first block quote at the top of page 17a of the red brief.
They understand that 623(a)(1) refers to actions
against individuals, whereas 623(a)(2) refers to actions
against groups, group policy versus individual action, and
they do that because of the introductory language to
(a)(1) and (a)(2), to fail or refuse to hire or to
discharge any individual; whereas, (a)(2) refers to limit,
segregate, or classify his employees.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a question at this
point going really back to the question I asked you at the
outset of the argument? If I thought seniority or years
of service was a reasonable factor other than age and if I
thought this particular compensation program was based on
years of service rather than age, can I look at the
reasonable factor other than age in deciding whether your
complaint states a cause of action?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Hazen Paper established
that that is not --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And if I do look at it and if
I do come to the conclusion I've suggested, would I not
have to dismiss your complaint?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: I may misunderstand the
hypothetical, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: The hypothetical -- and I
think it may be the case -- that you have a compensation
program which uses years of service as a basis for
classifying employees which has a disparate impact on
older workers, but it does -- also it relies squarely on a
reasonable factor other than age if you will call years of
service such a factor.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. That's perfectly
legitimate. That -- as I understand the hypothetical --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- suppose I want --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that to be this
case.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it would not because the
rationale given by the employer here for -- let -- let me
take us to the facts and then the explanation that's given
by the employer. What happened here is they gave all of
the line police officers much bigger raises than they gave
to the more senior officers. That -- and the difference
in pay between protected persons under the ADEA and non-
protected persons was 4 standard deviations, a 1 in 10,000
chance, statisticians will tell you. And they said --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the basis for
differentiation was years of service, was it not?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: The basis for differentiation
was years of service, but the question is in -- is it a
reasonable choice by the employer in this context. And
the reason is it's a --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm just asking in the
abstract. Why wouldn't that always be a -- a reasonable
factor other than age?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize. That -- and so I
think I answered your hypothetical too broadly. And that
is, it depends. In the great majority of cases, employers
certainly can say I want to give a class of employees more
money. Perfectly sensible. Congress didn't intend to
block that. But the question is, is this outside the
usual set of cases? And the city's explanation what --
for this policy, which was to give the line cops more
money but not the rest of the cops who happen to all be
over 40, was that they wanted to bring the salary up to a
-- a regional average. And so we asked the question, does
this accomplish that in a reasonable way, and it does not
because they left out huge categories of employees.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the factor -- if I
understand it, it wasn't because they were line officers,
it was rather because they had lesser years of service
than the more senior officers.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: No.
JUSTICE STEVENS: No.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is not the facts here.
That's right. They -- they did not say we are going to
give pay raises to the people who have lesser years of
service because we're concerned about their pay. To the
contrary.
Let me take you to one piece of the record that
I think will be helpful. Although again the cases
presents the legal question, the lower court on remand can
resolve the case. But at page 15 of the joint appendix,
there is the pay plan itself, and the first sentence is
that -- they -- explains the purpose. The -- the city
wanted to provide a compensation plan that will attract
and retain qualified people, and then it says, to all
employees regardless of age. They purported to be giving
the same treatment to everyone regardless --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think the statement of
purpose tells me what the -- what the criterion for the
different treatment was. I still think it was years of
service.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Stevens, I -- I just
think that -- it misunderstands the facts as I know them
in this particular case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What was the criterion?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: The criterion was that they took
the -- they had different kinds of officers. They had
police -- line police officers, master sergeants, all the
way on up through the system.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So in other words, the
criterion was the kind of rank they had before.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, and then --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't that a reasonable
factor other than age?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: The question is not whether that
because that's not -- having those criterion is perfectly
reasonable. The question is, is it reasonable -- and this
would be resolved on remand -- to give raises to only one
of those categories when your explanation is that you were
trying to give raises to bring everyone up to a regional
average? And so, Justice Stevens, I think --
JUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, you say the --
the question isn't whether they used a reasonable factor
other than age. Your question is whether the use of those
factors was overall reasonable.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. There are two things.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's a rewriting of the
statute.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, I -- I don't think so,
Justice Stevens. It's the same question that we ask in
title VII, and that is, was it a -- a -- there's a higher
bar there, but were you pursuing a -- a legitimate goal
and did you -- did you pursue it in a reasonable way?
That's why a title VII plaintiff -- and this has -- and I
do want to come back --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Title VII doesn't have
this language in it.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's absolutely right, but
it's not language here that would detract from that
structure of the -- of the title VII inquiry. All the
lower courts, for example, agree that it -- as I said,
follows the pre --
JUSTICE BREYER: Here you're saying
you're not attacking reasonable factor other than age. It
has to be based on reasonable factor other than age. And
I take it here you're saying it's not based on what they
advance as reasonable factors.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. They give --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. They give an explanation.
JUSTICE BREYER: But if I -- I say my
explanation for why I pay the newer people more is really
I like to have that atmosphere. You make less money in my
business, but it's more democratic and people are happier
even though no one will invest in my company.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: But still, I'd like a commune.
All right? That's how I want to do it. Now, that's not
totally idiotic. It's plausible. So I just win. Right?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: No. You would lose a treatment
case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, I lose a treatment case.
No, no. I'm not -- I'm just -- it's I'm not paying the
younger workers more. I'm paying the newer workers more.
All right? They happen to be much the same category, but
I -- I don't want it. It's not age. Or, you know, I pay
the lower paid workers more. How's that? Do I win?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: You paid the lower paid workers
more?
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. I paid the lower paid
workers more? I want to bring them up to the executives.
I -- I like it. It's more democratic and it makes a
happier group. And -- and so, now, do I win or lose?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: You, in all likelihood, win in
that hypothetical. You --
JUSTICE BREYER: I win. And I don't have to say
any more than that.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: No.
But let me tell you, it's still a very important
statute because -- for the reason that I framed before,
and that is, most cases that are ADEA disparate impact
cases are not cost cases. There are other tests:
applications procedures, strength tests, and the like.
That's what the EEOC believes is still very essential. So
while we don't impose a big burden on employers in the
cost context for the reasons that you and Justice Stevens
have been exploring, that doesn't mean our position is
somehow worthless. The EEOC has said that the disparate
impact plays a, quote/unquote, vital role under the ADEA
and that the respondents' position would greatly weaken
the statute because --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There haven't been a whole
lot of cases under the impact theory as applied to age,
and you just said you're not talking about the cost
category but that -- you mentioned physical fitness. And
there was a case. Smith against Des Moines involved that,
but it was found the -- the physical fitness test was job-
related.
Have there been mutual rules with a disparate
impact that you can give us as examples? When you're
talking about race and sex, the examples come to mind much
more readily than in the age category.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, I can. I'll give you two
sets of examples. The first is the examples identified by
the Solicitor General in his cert petition defending the
EEOC's position in the Francis W. Parker case in 1994.
The EEOC pursued cases -- and they're cited in the cert
petition -- involving rules that prohibit -- that require
recent college graduates to get a job that forbid hiring
someone who worked previously for a higher salary than
they would be getting in the new -- in the new job and
that laid off people who would be eligible to retire soon.
So those are the examples the Solicitor General gave.
I'll give you two other examples. One is a -- a
case called --
JUSTICE SCALIA: These are examples of--
violations or things that are okay?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Violations. I apologize. The
EEOC filed suit because of these violations of the act.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it a reasonable
factor other than age that I don't want to hire somebody
who's going to retire a year after I hire him?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Because it's not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, that seems to me terribly
reasonable.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: The --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care how old he is. I
don't want anybody who's going to retire the year after I
hire him. I don't want to have to go through this -- this
whole process again.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: The view of the commission --
it's one I share, but a particular court might not -- is
that that is not a good -- a reasonable work place
judgment. One could disagree with it. But the -- those
employees will be very valuable. And it's not that they
will retire, I should make clear. It's that they're
eligible to retire. It -- it may well be a different case
if you could say, I asked the person. They said they're
leaving in a year. The rule challenged there was mere
eligibility to retire, and they did give the other
examples.
I didn't finish with the court cases. They are
Klein, which is 807 F.Supp. 1517, which is a hiring test I
think by the FAA in that case that -- that happened to
exclude all of the people, I think, over the age of 55.
And there are other cases that are, in the line of cases
that I was discussing with Justice Breyer, in which the
employer doesn't say -- doesn't give the person who gets
the higher pay the option of taking a pay cut before being
fired. So the statute, both in the non-cost context and
the cost context, has very important applications.
I did want to return to your correct premise,
however, Justice Ginsburg. You said there aren't many
cases. I think it's important to recognize that the --
the important, legitimate cases, by and large, are
conciliated by the EEOC. Remember, it goes through an
administrative process first. The EEOC found a violation
here, gave us a right to sue letter. The -- the city just
declined to settle with us. There have been -- and I have
checked. There have been 74 disparate impact cases in the
history of the statute that are reported in the Federal
courts, and I think that is a good answer to the idea of
the respondents that this will impose a huge burden on
employers, the idea that there will be a massive amount of
litigation. Remember --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, once we -- if we were
to say it's covered, don't you think that number would
expand?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's possible it would expand
some, but I do think we're right to say not much
because --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's not the number of
cases either. I mean, you could have -- it wouldn't take
much to have a single case that has a rule in it, say,
that makes it very difficult for an employer to do things
of type X or type Y, and that would have enormous impact
even though you'd say, well, it was just one case.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, there are two fears I
think the respondents have articulated, neither of which
are borne out by actual experience because, Justice
O'Connor, the EEOC has recognized these claims for a
quarter century. Until 1993, every single circuit agreed
with us, and right now three circuits agree with us. So I
-- there is a large body of experience that suggests --
and that's where those 74 cases come from.
So, Justice Breyer, they have two concerns. One
is the mere notion of the possibility of liability will --
and the prospect of how expensive litigation would be --
would be deterring valuable employment practices. That's
not borne out by experience. Your point is, well, what if
the liability threshold is too high? And experience
suggests and the rules endorsed by the commission and the
lower courts are that the liability threshold is not too
high.
I did also want to say that it is the liability
threshold that is the key for deciding how to accommodate
the respondents' concerns. Justice O'Connor's Watson
plurality opinion explains that the evidentiary standards
that apply in these disparate impact cases should serve as
adequate safeguards. The precise, same argument was made
by the business community in Watson, saying, look, we're
going to have to adopt quotas. This will be entirely
unmanageable.
Before I sit down and reserve the remainder of
my time, I did want to say we have a really good case, to
refer back to my last argument, and that's Griggs, which
is about the exact same statutory text. And then we have
a line, a wall that is uninterrupted of this Court's
authority. Six straight decisions say when the statute --
title VII says something and the ADEA says the same thing,
they have the parallel construction. And in our view the
respondents' arguments aren't good enough to overcome the
double hurdle of stare decisis and Chevron deference.
If I could reserve the remainder of my time.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nager.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. NAGER: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may
it please the Court:
If I may, I'd like to go straight to the
question as to why mere statistical correlations with age
don't create a prima facie case of discrimination because
of age.
This Court in its title VII cases has said that
a mere statistical correlation with race or sex can create
a prima facie case of discrimination because of race or
sex because it's advanced a proposition that there's no
inherent correlation between race and sex and ability to
perform a job or do a job. And as a consequence, the
Court has said that a statistical disparity is a departure
from the expected norm. Thus, the statistical disparity
creates a suspect situation which could be treated as a
prima facie case of discrimination because of age, to use
the Court's term in Watson, the functional equivalent of
intentional discrimination.
In the age context, the premise doesn't apply.
In the age context, as Justice Breyer pointed out in the
Florida Power argument, as he's pointed out again today,
age is inherently correlated with myriad selection
practices. It's painful to say, particularly to a Court
that's a little bit older than I am, but our mental and
physical capacities are not constant over our lifetimes.
They're different for each one of us, but statistically
they change over time and they deteriorate over time, and
progress doesn't treat the skills and abilities that we
have with -- the same way to people who are at different
stages in life. Our education and our technological --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Verdi wrote Falstaff when he
was 70 -- late -- in his late 70's. It was his greatest
creation. Something.
MR. NAGER: There is no doubt, particularly in
occupations like judging --
(Laughter.)
MR. NAGER: -- that experience and wisdom may be
something that grow over a lifetime. But as we know --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wunsler died at about 28,
didn't he?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. 34.
JUSTICE SCALIA: 34, well --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me ask you this.
If-- if your argument has force, why haven't we been having
horrible example piled upon horrible example since 1981
when the EEOC took the position that it takes?
MR. NAGER: The answer to that is as follows, is
that Justice -- Chief -- then Justice Rehnquist, now Chief
Justice Rehnquist, wrote a dissent from denial at the time
of Geller v. Markham. And in my practical experience --
and I do defend these cases for a living -- that put a
tremendous chill on the plaintiffs bar, and there were
very few of these cases brought.
But contrary to Mr. Goldstein, who doesn't
represent employers and help them plan their selection
practices, employers made huge changes in the '80's and
the early '90's until this Court's decision in Hazen Paper
because employers were scared of these cases, and so
employers started managing the numbers. There were a lot
of reductions in force in the late '80's, as I'm sure this
Court remembers, as our Nation went through a -- a
industrial restructuring. And every one of those
reductions in force, I had to sit down with my clients and
break up the age of the work force into bands and see how
people were going to be affected and move numbers. And
the irony, of course, is -- is in doing that, employers
adversely impact the very people who are benefited by the
disparate impact doctrine under title VII because the Age
Discrimination Act principally favors more senior, older
white males, and when you try to manage your numbers so
that you don't adversely impact older white males, what
happens is -- is you adversely impact the new entrants to
the work force who in the last 25 years have been much
greater numbers of racial minorities and females.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do about the EEOC's
regulation? Why isn't that -- why isn't that entitled to
Chevron deference?
MR. NAGER: Let me answer that. First of all,
the -- the answer is, is you only get to Chevron deference
if this statute is not subject to construction by this
Court in phase one of Chevron. The first question is can
this Court, looking at the language of the statute and the
other legal materials, interpret the statute to have a
single, reasonably clear meaning.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How can we possibly say that
it's not ambiguous when we have, in another context,
interpreted the identical language to permit --
MR. NAGER: Just the way this Court did last
term in the General Dynamics case, which I realize you
dissented on this point, Justice Scalia. But just last
term in the General Dynamics case, this Court held that
the phrase, because of age, is idiomatically and
contextually different than the phrase, because of race or
sex. And my point to Justice Breyer is -- is that the
phrase, because of age, cannot properly be construed to be
satisfied by a mere statistical correlation with age.
JUSTICE STEVENS: In that -- in that
case, we were construing the word age and age definitely
has a different meaning from sex or -- or race.
MR. NAGER: I'm not saying that the -- the
General Dynamics case disposes of this case, Justice
Stevens. I'm simply pointing out that, as Justice
Souter's opinion for the Court last term held, that
similar language in similar statutes can have different
meaning and not be ambiguous.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but not whole texts, not
-- I don't remember whether it was (1)-(1) and (2) or (a)
and (b), but this is not a word, age. It's -- it's lines and
lines, and to -- and to say, oh, in Griggs we held that
the title VII language -- this language means you can have
a disparate impact theory, but in age, we're going to read
those very same words to prohibit. In one sense -- one
you read to say, these words permit disparate impact, and
then you read the same words to say these words
prohibit --
MR. NAGER: No.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- disparate impact.
MR. NAGER: That is not quite right, Justice
Ginsburg. What we're saying is -- is that the natural meaning
of the phrase, because of, either in title VII or in the
Age Act, is a natural, more conventional reference to
intent. Nonetheless, the Court, because of the objectives
of title VII and because statistical correlations could
equal a functional equivalent of intentional
discrimination, construed title VII to go beyond intent-
based claims to encompass disparate impact claims. Our
point to the Court today is -- is that neither of those
two critical premises apply, that a mere correlation with
age does not, in the context of age, equal a prima facie
case of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's so, Congress
shouldn't have copied the language of title VII. It isn't
a matter of it just accidentally comes out to -- to be
sounding the same, as though, you know, two monkeys did it
on a typewriter or something. They copied -- they copied
title VII.
MR. NAGER: Well, they copied it before Griggs
was decided, indeed, before any agency of Government,
before any court in this country, and before any academic
in this country had floated the concept --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think it's a fair
conclusion that they meant the two to mean the same thing,
whether it was before Griggs or after Griggs. They copied
the language. It seems to me they wanted the two to mean
the same.
MR. NAGER: I -- I think that that's wrong,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- or at least it is
arguably so, in which case you come back to my question.
Why isn't the -- the EEOC's resolution of that ambiguity
conclusive?
MR. NAGER: Well, let me answer that question
directly and then come back and argue with you about your
premise. If you turn to the appendix and on the red
brief, page 56a is the regulation. And it is -- as
Justice Kennedy pointed out, it is not an interpretation
of the prohibition of the statute. It is an
interpretation of the reasonable factor other than age
provision. And as an initial point, I'd submit to you,
Justice Scalia, that it's one thing to defer to an
agency's interpretation of the provision that you're being
asked to construe in resolving what the meaning of the
provision you're being asked to construe is. It's another
thing to defer to their interpretation of a distinct
provision which isn't a prohibition at all.
Let me move on and let's read what it says,
though. What it says is -- is the following. It's
interpreting a phrase that says is based on a reasonable
factor other than age, which Mr. Goldstein has conceded in
his brief and the petitioners in the Florida Power case
also conceded is necessarily a reference to
intentionality. But there's not a word in this regulation
about employer intentions. Quite the contrary.
And the reason why I -- I asked you to turn to
page 56a of our brief rather than the quotation of the
regulation in Mr. Goldstein's brief is because there's an
additional sentence in the regulation that Mr. Goldstein
didn't print in his brief, and that is that the EEOC said
where tests are involved --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where are you reading
from?
MR. NAGER: Page 56a of the red brief. I'm
sorry, Justice. It's section (d).
JUSTICE SCALIA: (e)?
MR. NAGER: (d) as in David.
What the EEOC said is that the reasonable
factors other than age provision is not an intent-based
provision. It's a business necessity provision. They did
it, saying it means the same thing as it's -- as it means
in title VII because their whole purpose here was to
conform the Age Act to title VII, and they said you have
to comply, where tests are involved, with the Uniform
Guidelines on Employee Selection that they jointly
promulgated with the Department of Labor, the Justice
Department, and the Civil Service branch, whose name has
escaped me right now.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nager, I'm lost. What --
what part of 56a are you referring to? (d)?
MR. NAGER: (d) on page 56a. I'm sorry?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Does it say what you just
said?
MR. NAGER: Tests which are asserted -- the last
sentence. Tests which are asserted as reasonable factors
other than age will be scrutinized in accordance with the
standards set forth at part 1607 of this title. Part 1607
of this title is the Uniform Guidelines on Employee
Selection.
JUSTICE BREYER: All that's true, but they --
they did promulgate this guideline, as far as -- I looked
it up. At that time, they said, look, it's going to be
disparate impact, and they cited Griggs. And people have
put comments, which I haven't read yet, but I imagine the
comments went to disparate impact. And then when they
rewrote it in this form, they have a little paragraph of
explanation which makes pretty clear it's meant to be
disparate impact.
MR. NAGER: I have no doubt that they were
assuming that this Court's decision in Griggs -- because
this is what they said in their comments -- this Court's
decision in Griggs required disparate impact analysis --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, all right. But I mean,
they -- everybody knew what they were driving at at the
time they promulgated this. So it seemed to me that if --
if we're not governed by the reg, it must be because the
reg is outside the statutory authority. And it might be
outside the statutory authority if in fact it embodies too
tough a test.
MR. NAGER: It's -- it's outside the -- the
statutory authority for two reasons.
JUSTICE BREYER: But now we've heard it doesn't
embody that much of a tough test, and you know, the EEOC
isn't here to tell us --
MR. NAGER: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- what in fact it thinks.
MR. NAGER: Mr. Goldstein cited a bunch of EEOC
briefs in his brief, and you'll notice he didn't quote a
single part of -- of those EEOC briefs which say that the
standard under the Age Act is less than the standard under
the Age Act. What he cites to is a footnote in his
opening brief where he quotes one sentence from an EEOC
brief where an EEOC appellate lawyer said it is -- is
likely that an employer will be able to prevail more
often.
The EEOC never said -- and -- and I litigate
against them. I can tell you the only thing that they
would hate less but hate a lot than your ruling in our
favor that there's no disparate impact claims at all is
that Mr. Goldstein has represented what their version of
the defense is because that's not the Government's
position.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So we don't know
what the Government's position is. They're not here. So
suppose I think, one, the language is against you, the
language of the statute. I do think it's against you.
Two, the EEOC reg does foresee a disparate impact test.
Three, the practicalities are absolutely with you, and
that has to go with the scope of the statute. And four,
it might be possible for the EEOC to write a reg that
deals with the problems you're worried about while
advancing a disparate impact test. Suppose I think all
those things --
MR. NAGER: Which one --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- which are at least
consistent. What would I do with this case? That's my
problem.
MR. NAGER: Okay. I -- I would submit that you
should --
JUSTICE BREYER: Where the Government hasn't
appeared and told us what they want to do or what they
think should be done, et cetera.
MR. NAGER: I -- I should -- I would submit,
Justice Breyer, that you should reexamine your premise
that the language of the Age Act, both in section 4(a) by
itself and construed in light of 4(f) and the legislative
history and purposes of the statute encompass disparate
impact claims.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the EEOC regulation was
not so much an interpretation of the statute as an
interpretation of Griggs.
MR. NAGER: Oh, I think that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, maybe this provision
represents the judgment of the agency that Griggs applies
to this other statute, and -- and I'm not sure that we owe
Chevron deference to that determination.
MR. NAGER: Well, I -- I don't think you did,
although I don't even think, frankly, from what I've read
is they made the judgment. They made the assumption.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Nager, will you go to
another one of Justice Breyer's premises? He says
following the practicalities are with you, which you're
certainly going to accept. He says I think the EEOC can
deal with some of these practical problems. Do you think
so? Why not?
MR. NAGER: Great question and the answer is no,
they can't. And the reason is --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Give me some examples.
MR. NAGER: The reason is -- is because if you
-- if you lower the prima facie case so that it's
meaningless, so that it means that all a plaintiff has to
do is find a selection practice -- because it's always
going to correlate with age -- it means you shifted the
burden to an employer in every case to establish that its
-- its practice meets whatever standard your hypothesizing
the EEOC might come up with later, Justice Breyer.
Meanwhile, the world has to go on, and what my
clients will do is as follows. They will say, well, you
know, we're not going to wait to see if -- if this new
practice we're going to consider is going to stand the
test of time in court and under the EEOC's yet-to-be-
articulated regulation. We're going to stick with the
tried and true. We are not going to innovate at all, and
if we're going to innovate, we're going to massage the
numbers while we do it. The employers --
JUSTICE BREYER: That would be a fairly easy
burden -- a fairly easy burden to meet. And -- and to give
you a fairly easy burden is consistent with the idea of
trying to get employers to think about the problem. An
employer who uses a different factor which is correlated
with age but it's -- it's an unreasonable thing to do or
it isn't the real basis hasn't thought about the harm that
he's working.
MR. NAGER: Well, as --
JUSTICE BREYER: So we could give you an easy
burden and still accomplish the objective.
MR. NAGER: I -- I don't want to resist the easy
burden, but I do want to tell you, as Justice Scalia
pointed out in the Florida Power argument, my clients do
think about these things because if -- you know, if they
adopt an unreasonable practice that has an adverse
statistical effect and they think they're likely to get
sued about it, they actually do have to worry about it
because these cases are tried to juries and they have to
have a reasonable explanation for what their practice
because they get tried to juries as disparate treatment
cases.
Our point is not that statistics are not
admissible. They are. Our point is -- is that they're
not sufficient by themselves to create a prima facie case
of -- because of age, as it would be in a title VII case
where we wouldn't expect to see the statistical disparity.
So it's fair to say that there's a reasonable adverse
inference to be drawn from the existence of the disparity
itself. That is the premise articulated by this Court as
to why the disparate impact doctrine can -- can at -- the
prima facie case aspect of it equals a prima facie case of
discrimination because of race or sex. That is not true
here.
Now, it is also the case that when this Court
adopted the disparate impact doctrine, it said it placed
an enormous weight on the objectives of title VII's
prohibitions, which it construed to be, as Justice
Ginsburg pointed out, eliminating these built-in
headwinds.
Well, when -- when the Secretary of Labor
proposed the Age Discrimination Act, he gave a report to
Congress and he said age discrimination is different than
race and sex discrimination. It is not based on animus.
It is -- it is not dealing with a group of individuals who
have suffered cumulative disabilities over their lifetime
because of historic discrimination. He said it's -- the
problem of age discrimination is the problem of over-
generalization by an employer.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he gave the very same
example that was Griggs. He gave the example of the high
school diploma because he thought that people of a certain
age, when there wasn't such general education as there is
today, might not have a high school diploma to a much
higher extent than the people who came -- the generation
who came after.
MR. NAGER: But his solution was not a disparate
impact doctrine. His solution was --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's a little, and you
said his solution was we're going to have training and
manuals and all. But that's not altogether clear.
MR. NAGER: Well, take a look at the statute,
Justice Ginsburg. Please look at page 15a and 16a in the
red brief. And if you look at section 621(b) -- it's at
the bottom of page 15a of the red brief -- Congress said
what the purposes of the Age Discrimination Act were, and
it had three, but it's only addressed one through the
prohibition. The second one was to prohibit arbitrary age
discrimination in employment. The other two were to
promote employment of older persons based on ability and
to help employers and workers find ways of meeting
problems arising from the impact of age on employment.
And if you turn the page and look at section
2(a)(1), the very first thing Congress mandates that the Secretary
shall do to address its other two purposes, to undertake
research and promote research with a view to reducing
barriers to the employment of older persons and the
promotion of measures for using their skills.
What the Secretary of Labor's report goes on at
length about is it identifies all kinds of factors,
neutral and non-neutral --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn't say there that
that is to implement the first -- that -- that only the
second one, to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination.
MR. NAGER: It does -- what it -- you're right
it doesn't say the following. It doesn't say, and we
don't want disparate impact, because in 1967 the -- the
concept of disparate impact as a legal theory was unknown
to Congress, to the courts, and to the administrative
agencies.
But what the Secretary of Labor did do in his
report is, after identifying all of the problems that
adversely affect older workers, he says, I recommend a
two-pronged approach. One prong is prohibitory. It's
coercive. You shall not -- we'll prohibit arbitrary age
discrimination in employment, which the Secretary
explained to Congress, and this Court last term said
itself, means a -- is a -- is -- is the use of age as the
decision-making criteria.
He said, separately we should have a series of
programs that seek to enlarge the abilities of older
workers, that seek to educate employers about the
abilities of older workers through non-coercive programs.
And so what this statute does -- and this Court
has said it in several of its cases -- this statute was
based upon the Secretary of Labor's report. The Secretary
wrote the bill, and although Congress amended it in other
ways, it didn't amend any of these provisions. That this
statute took a more nuanced approach to deal with a
distinctly different problem, and the problem --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nager, at the end of his
report, Secretary Wirtz said the -- a purpose, to
eliminate discrimination in the employment of older
workers, it would necessary not only to deal with overt
acts of discrimination, but also to adjust those present
employment practices which quite unintentionally lead to
age limits in hiring.
And your point, as I understand it, yes, that
was one of his purposes, but he meant that one to be
accomplished with ERISA and other things like that.
MR. NAGER: Well, the quote that you just gave
says that there are express uses of age and there are non-
age reasons that lead to the use of express limits of age,
for example, the hypothetical that Justice Scalia gave
with Mr. Goldstein, saying, well, I wouldn't want to hire
someone who's going -- who tells me they're going to
retire a year from now. But if he said I'm not going to
hire you because you're 64 because I know you're going to
-- people retire at 65 mostly, that would be the same kind
of non-age-based motive that nevertheless used age as a
decision-making criteria. That's what that quote is
referring to. If you -- if you -- the second half --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The quote -- the reference to
employment practices which quite unintentionally lead to
age limits in hiring. I see what you're saying.
MR. NAGER: Right.
And then -- and -- and the point here is this
was thought out. It wasn't thought out as disparate
treatment versus disparate impact because the concepts
didn't exist at the time, but it was thought out as
arbitrary age discrimination versus other factors that
adversely bear on older workers. The prohibitions went to
arbitrary age discrimination and didn't go to the adverse
impacts. It was the -- the non-coercive measures that
went to the adverse impacts.
Let me go also --
JUSTICE BREYER: No how does that work?
Because the -- the particular language, it shall be
unlawful for an employer to classify his employees in any
way that would adversely affect an individual's status --
his status, it says -- as an employee because of such
individual's age. Now, that sounds as if it's driving
right at disparate impact. It's -- it's unlawful to
classify an employee in any way that would adversely
affect him because of his age. That's what it says.
And then you turn to the defense and it says, but
there's the defense with a differentiation, i.e., the
classification is based on reasonable factors other than
age. And therefore it would sound as if it says, look at
the factor and ask is the factor reasonable. If so, the
employer wins if it's really based on that factor.
MR. NAGER: Two points?
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. NAGER: One is -- is --
JUSTICE BREYER: How do we get out of that
language?
MR. NAGER: Well, we love the language. We
don't have to get out of it. It says because of age.
That's a reference, a traditional, conventional
reference --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but it says -- it says
that would adversely affect him because of his age.
MR. NAGER: Well, the first -- before the comma
is the statement both of the action of the employer and
the injury that it has to cause in order for a claim to
exist, and then there's another requirement. The
requirement is -- is that the action and the -- the effect
of -- the injury that's affected by it be -- because of
age. That is a conventional reference to intent.
And the confirmation that it's a reference --
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no. It's not intent
because to read it as part of classifying, which
you'd have to do to get it because of intent, you'd have
to say to classify his employees because of such
individual's age. Now, that's a little tough because
you're talking about employees, and then you go to such
individual.
MR. NAGER: It -- it -- the phrase, because of
age, modifies all of the words that precede the comma that
separates the two.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Segregate or classify. You
want to read it all the way up back to segregate or
classify.
MR. NAGER: Well, I -- I think it does modify
the verb, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It would be good if you had a
comma after employees. I -- I might go along with you if
there was a comma after -- to limit, segregate, or
classify his employees, comma, in any way which would
deprive or tend to deprive any individual of opportunities
or otherwise affect his status as an employee, comma,
because of such individual's age -- go way back to before
the comma. I can see that, but without the comma, that's
-- that's an awful travel back to limit, segregate, or
classify.
MR. NAGER: Well, I -- I think that's the
grammatically correct way to read it. But even -- even if
it was just modifying the adversely affect --
JUSTICE BREYER: It would be the natural way.
MR. NAGER: -- it would still be because of age.
JUSTICE BREYER: The natural way -- wait. The
natural way is to read it as modifying to deprive --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- or otherwise adversely
affect.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the natural way to read
JUSTICE SCALIA: It is.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now --
MR. NAGER: One still --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- suppose we read it that way.
Then what do you say?
MR. NAGER: You -- even if you read it that way,
it still says, comma, because of age, and the because of
age is a reference to intent, and the confirmation of
that, Justice Breyer, is the defense that you keep
pointing to because as Mr. Goldstein conceded in his brief
and as you pointed out in your questioning, it says, is
based on. That is also a reference to intent. This
statute is preoccupied with intent.
What section 4(f) was about was identifying the
situations in which age would be used but it, nonetheless,
wouldn't even be arbitrary --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, and I guess what
supports that reading is that intent -- intent to
discriminate in hiring -- the intentional discrimination
because of age in hiring is covered by (2) rather than (1)
isn't it?
MR. NAGER: No, no, no.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think -- I mean, if -- if
you have a rule -- if you have a rule that you won't hire
any employee -- I mean, we -- we were talking earlier
about the -- the reason -- (2) reads employees in the
plural, and (1) reads refuse to hire or discharge any
individual. So if you have any intentional discrimination
that is against a class, it comes under (2) rather than
(1).
MR. NAGER: I had never thought of construing
the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that wrong? Well, I thought
-- I thought that's what -- what counsel for the
petitioner was telling us.
MR. NAGER: Well, if -- if he did, he's only
strengthened our case.
What I want to say to the Court is -- is that
both of those provisions are modified by the phrase,
because of age. This Court in Hazen Paper construed the
because of language in 4(a)(1) as a reference to intent
and said statistical correlations with age are not
sufficient to establish because of age within the meaning
of section 4(a)(1). And the presumption of uniform usage
-- we're entitled to point to it as well that the
presumption of uniform usage which would be that the
phrase, because of age, in section 4(a)(2) is also not
satisfied by a mere statistical correlation with age.
And the reason why title VII is different than
the Age Act -- I keep coming back to this because this is
so critical, Justice Breyer -- is that the premise of the
Court's statistical cases under title VII is that it's --
it presumes that there's no inherent difference in ability
between the races and the genders, whereas you know and I
know that there is a difference in an -- an inherent
correlation between abilities and skills, between people
of different ages statistically. And so that whereas in
the -- in the race and sex context, a statistical
disparity by itself points out that there's something
suspect and so would justify putting the employer to the
burden on those occasions which would happen. And by
definition, I think you and I both think, Justice Breyer,
that it's not all that often that you're going to have
these statistical disparities in the race and sex context.
In the age context, they happen all the time. So it's --
it -- there's no basis for suggesting that a statistical
correlation by itself creates something suspect, and it
would rob the notion of a prima facie case of any meaning
to say that -- that a statistical correlation with age,
which we expect to see all the time, would establish a
prima facie wrong.
And, of course, the Secretary of Labor wrote a
report telling Congress that race and sex were different
than age for this very reason.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But in your view, is based on
reasonable factors other than age strictly an affirmative
defense?
MR. NAGER: I -- I think that it is -- it was
intended to address mixed motive cases. That's why it was
added. I think it is a indicia of the fact that this
statute is concerned with intent in its prohibitions only.
I'm not saying it's conclusive of that, but I'm saying
it's another indicia, that if you look at all of section
(f), it's about the instances in which age is being
used --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But is it an affirmative
defense?
MR. NAGER: I -- I don't think that it is, and I
-- I --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, did you challenge the
sufficiency of this complaint on the ground that it did
not allege that the -- the program was not based on -- was
based on factors that were unreasonable?
MR. NAGER: I -- I didn't handle the case in the
trial court, but I believe that the -- our -- our client
denied all of the allegations in the complaint and
affirmatively said this was -- its salary program was a
reasonable factor other than age, yes. And certainly in
the courts below, the reasonable --
JUSTICE STEVENS: What I'm trying to think
through is whether that issue is one that can be resolved
on the pleadings, or does it always require a trial.
MR. NAGER: Well, I think the question of
whether or not the reasonable factor other than age
provision, when read in conjunction with section (a)(4) --
(a) shows that this is an intent-based statute, as a pure
legal question, can be judged on the pleadings. The --
the question of whether or not a -- in a particular fact
situation something is a reasonable factor other than age
or not I think would be subject to what the proof is. It
might be undisputed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: On your reading, I just don't
see that there's any function. I mean, if disparate
impact is out of it, then -- then what work is there for
the reasonable factor other than age to do?
MR. NAGER: It was added in as a safe harbor to
address mixed motive cases. There was a concern at the
time that since employers had been using age as the
decision-making factor, that they would continue to think
about it, and the question was raised, well, would that
mean that the very fact they thought of it, even though
they had a nondiscriminatory reason, mean that they still
violated the act? And the Secretary said, no, we've put
in this reasonable factor other than age provision to make
it clear. It -- it was simply a safe harbor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Nager. I think
you've answered the question.
Mr. Goldstein, you have 4 minutes, and let's
make it 4 and a half.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Justice Stevens.
I want to start with our affirmative case which
is one of stare decisis and then go to what I think is the
thing that might concern the Court and that's the
practicalities of implementing our rule.
Our stare decisis case I think is fairly
decisive. The language of title VII was the model for the
ADEA. It runs all the way through the same in subsection
(a)(2). This Court construed the text of the statute to
give rise to disparate impact liability, and there are six
cases of this Court that say when the language is the
same, because one was derived from the other, we give them
the same meaning.
Now, I take it that the respondents have three
answers to that.
The first is they attempt to rewrite the
rationale of Griggs and say Griggs really isn't so much
about the text of the statute. It's what Congress was
getting after, and this Court in Griggs was principally
concerned with the fact that, look, in the context of age
and sex discrimination, there's no legitimate correlation
between an -- a disparate impact and a legitimate employer
policy. That is not, in fact, what the rationale of
Griggs is.
The rationale of Griggs is that it doesn't
matter to the employee if you are purposefully
discriminated against or accidentally discriminated
against. Congress was concerned with the effects of
discrimination. And this Court reached that conclusion
based on the text of the statute. If I could read from
Griggs, quote, the objective of Congress in the enactment
of title VII is plain from the language of the statute.
That's the same language as in our statute. The thrust of
section 703(a)(2) was to address, quote, the consequences
of employment practices, not simply the motivation.
This Court subsequently reiterated twice that
disparate impact comes from the text of the statute, not
from the air. Those two cases are quoted at page 9 of our
reply brief and they resolve all doubts about commas and
because of or anything like that. The Court in both
Connecticut v. Teal and Justice O'Connor's opinion for the
Court in Watson tied it directly to the statute. If I
could just read the Watson example. Again, they're quoted
in full. In disparate impact cases, quote, the employer's
practices may be said to, quote, adversely affect an
individual's status as an employee because of such
individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national
origin.
Now, the second argument they have -- and this
was the Fifth Circuit's argument -- is the RFOA provision
exists in the ADEA, not in title VII. I do not understand
how the RFOA provision -- if it means anything, it doesn't
help us.
Again, let me take you back to the text. It's
on page 1 of the blue brief. It's in a few other places,
but it's there. It shall not be unlawful for an employer
to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsection
(a) where the differentiation is based on reasonable
factors other than age. The necessary premise of that
provision is that something will be otherwise unlawful
when it's based on something other than age. It can't be
talking about disparate treatment. The only kind of
liability that involves factors other than age is impact.
And then on top of that, Congress required that the
employer's conduct be reasonable.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What of dual motive?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Because the statute refers to
something otherwise unlawful, it can't be talking about
Price Waterhouse mixed motive. Price Waterhouse mixed
motive cases establish liability; i.e., you're not liable
if you had another reason for doing it. But the premise
of (f)(1) is that it's already otherwise unlawful, this is a
defense to that.
The third thing that they say is that in Hazen
Paper this Court construed the because of language in
(a)(1) not to refer to impact. The critical difference is
that the (a)(1) language does not include the -- the
clause that refers to the impact on the employee that
Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer talked about with Mr.
Nager. They're structured very differently.
As to the practicalities, let me just say this
has been the rule for a quarter century of the EEOC. It
was the rule in every circuit until 1993. It is still the
rule in three circuits. The notion that there is a big
problem with administering it and that the EEOC can't
recognize the -- as it has in all the examples we cite,
that it's easier for an employer to prevail in the ADEA
context is not accurate.
I also want to just agree with Justice Breyer,
that an important part of impact liability is just making
employers think about it. And that comes from Justice
Kennedy's opinion in McKennon where he said that disparate
impact, quote, acts as a spur or catalyst to cause
employers to self-examine and self-evaluate their
employment practices to endeavor to eliminate, so far as
possible, the last vestiges of discrimination.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.
The case is submitted.
