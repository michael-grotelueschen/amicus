CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Plans v. Florida.
Mr. Waxman?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In Stolt-Nielsen, this Court held first that
a party may not be compelled to submit to arbitration
unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that
the party agreed to do so. And second, that because
class arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to
such a degree that it cannot be presumed that parties
consented to class arbitration simply by agreeing to
submit their disputes to an arbitrator. That precisely
describes this case.
The agreement commits the parties to submit
their disputes to arbitration and says nothing about
class arbitration. There is no extrinsic evidence
suggesting that the parties ever considered such a
prospect, and there is no background principle of State
law that favors it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- about the parties
never considering it, when this case was in the New
Jersey courts, Oxford explained -- this is in the red
brief at page 27 that's quoting Oxford's counsel then,
that "the arbitrator has the power to ascertain whether
the parties contemplated class arbitration in their
agreements." A power in the arbitrator that Oxford does
not contest. Does it -- that seems to be a recognition
by Oxford that -- that class arbitration was
contemplated.
MR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, two
things. First of all, if you look at page 10 -- or page
, footnote 7 of our yellow brief, you'll see all of
the references made in the advocacy before the State
court judge by my -- my brother here, not recognizing
repeatedly that what Oxford was asking for was a
dismissal and a transfer to individual arbitration --
bilateral arbitration.
There was no mistake, whatsoever, in the New
Jersey State courts that Oxford's position was that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your answer.
MR. WAXMAN: Yes -- that bilateral
arbitration was what was requested, and -- but there was
similarly no dispute that both parties -- certainly
Oxford took the position based on an understanding of
New Jersey law at the time because this Court hadn't
decided class action question, that the decision would
be submitted in the first instance to the arbitrator as
it was in Stolt-Nielsen.
Yes, Justice Sotomayor. I apologize.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's my question. Did
you never -- you never argued that it was beyond the
power of the arbitrator to decide this question, did
you?
MR. WAXMAN: In the first instance, no.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And do you take the
position that this is a -- always an arbitrator's
question when all disputes are supposed to be submitted,
or was just -- was there just a mistake here?
MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think there was a
mistake here. I think it was -- it was understandable,
in light of the state of the law in 2002. But we --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why should we rewrite
our standard of review to accommodate your client's
error? Because that's really what you're asking us to
MR. WAXMAN: I'm --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: More than once we have
said an error of law or fact is not a basis to say that
an arbitrator exceeded his or her powers.
MR. WAXMAN: Oh, Justice Sotomayor, we are
not asking the Court to vary in any material respect the
highly deferential standard that's reflected in Section
(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act.
But we are asking that that generally
applicable standard of review be applied to a question
with a very strong empirical presumption that the FAA
has attached to it and this Court has announced, which
is, that absent an actual agreement by the contracting
parties that they will permit their disputes to be
arbitrated on a class basis, an inference that may not,
as a matter of Federal law, be derived from an agreement
to submit all disputes to arbitration --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So your rule is that
although we must defer to an arbitrator's interpretation
of the contract, in this case, there is an exception
because?
MR. WAXMAN: Well, in this case, you defer,
as you always do, but you -- you have to provide --
there is some level of review. It's not just because
the arbitrator says I've looked at the contract and I
think this.
As this Court has said over and over again,
including in Stolt, just saying something is so doesn't
make it so. There is deferential review, but there is
review. And the review is of a proposition that this
Court has now said twice strongly presumes that there
is -- there is no agreement to arbitrate as a class
unless it is clearly shown to be so and that that
showing is not satisfied by an all-disputes clause.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so we make that rule
just with reference to the word "arbitration" when it's
in the class action context, or does this apply to other
words as well?
MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm just not sure
what the --
MR. WAXMAN: So I -- I think -- I mean, this
Court has recognized repeatedly that class -- that the
question of class versus bilateral arbitration is a
special kind of question under the FAA as to which the
Federal Arbitration Act itself applies a rule of
decision.
And therefore, the question I suppose is,
when a court looks at a -- an assertion by an arbitrator
that the language of the contract permits -- and in this
case, the arbitrator found that it required class
arbitration, a court has to ascertain whether that
assertion of fact is at least plausible, or, to use the
vernacular of this Court in Stolt-Nielsen, the Court
said in Stolt-Nielsen that the stipulation left no room
for an argument that the parties had agreed.
And similarly here, the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was no -- in
Stolt-Nielsen, the parties stipulated that the contract
said nothing on the issue of class proceeding. In this
case, we have no such stipulation --
MR. WAXMAN: Correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and the arbitrator is
interpreting a term of the contract, the ordinary rule
is that -- that the arbitration -- arbitrator's
interpretation of a contract term, wrong or right,
unless it's off the wall, is -- is not to be overturned.
MR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the --
everyone agrees in this case, as one would have to,
based on the holding in Stolt-Nielsen, that if the --
this arbitration clause in this case just said all
disputes will be arbitrated, not litigated, that the
arbitrator could not -- the arbitrator would be reversed
if it -- if he found that that indicated an actual
agreement of the parties to class arbitration. That is
inconsistent with the actual holding in Stolt-Nielsen.
And in this case, that sentence is
indistinguishable from that orthodox clause. All that
we --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you're saying
that this is off the wall. That's your -- to put it
in -- in Justice Ginsburg's terms, right?
MR. WAXMAN: Well, not to be pejorative, but
I would say this, in the vernacular of Stolt-Nielsen,
this language, quote, "leaves no room" for a conclusion
that the parties agree to arbitrate on the facts --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're saying -- you're
saying that the -- that the deference which we give to
arbitrator's statement of fact, like the deference we
give to a lower court's adjudication of fact, has a
limit, that at some point, the distortion of fact
becomes an issue, a question of law rather than fact,
right?
MR. WAXMAN: Yes. And in this case, a
question of Federal arbitration.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have other examples
from other -- other review that we've given to
arbitrators' factual decisions?
MR. WAXMAN: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I -- I don't want
to adopt a special rule for -- for class actions, but
if -- if you're telling me this is just a general
principle, that at some point if it's too much off the
wall, it becomes an error of law and -- and we can
reverse it. What -- what other examples do -- do we
have?
MR. WAXMAN: Well, let me -- let me -- let
me refer you to Stolt-Nielsen first, and then to a
hypothetical example that my brother gives.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I want a case.
You're --
MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Stolt-Nielsen said --
I -- I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that is a class action
case. I -- I don't care what it said. I want a --
MR. WAXMAN: Oh, you mean a non-class action
case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I want a case where we
have, or where Federal courts have with our approval,
disregarded a -- a factual finding by an arbitrator
because the factual finding was too much off the wall.
That there was simply not enough basis to support it.
MR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, I can't -- I'm
sort of trying to scroll through all your arbitration
decisions. I can't -- there may be. I can't think of a
holding of this -- well, no, I guess -- I guess First
Options is an example in which the arbitrator found that
the parties had agreed to let the arbitrator decide the
arbitrability question. And this Court held that that
was wrong as a matter of fact.
The Court reviewed the -- the facts of the
case and said there is no way that the Kaplans agreed to
have the arbitrability question submitted.
And if I may -- I realize this isn't an
actual case -- but my brother gives the example of a
form of deferential review, which would allow a court to
examine and reverse an arbitrator's decision in a
context in which the arbitration agreement says, this is
going to be arbitrated under California law, and the
arbitrator says, well, I'm going to apply New York law
in this case because -- I don't know, the parties have
all moved to New York and they like New York and they
litigate in New York.
My brother says that is reviewable and
reversible. And that's exactly what we have here. We
have here a clause that this Court has said cannot
suffice to establish actual agreement to arbitrate as a
class.
And the arbitrator has said nonetheless, I
have read it that way.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but it's not
exactly -- this is not the only clause that provides for
arbitration. It is not the standard boilerplate so you
could say when he interprets it, he's really making a
decision about arbitrability. And you can follow -- I
mean, you may disagree with it, I may disagree with
it -- but you understand the reasoning. It says, no
civil action be brought, all such disputes will go to
arbitration, this is a class action, this is a civil
action, so it must go to arbitration, and therefore,
it's there.
Now, you -- you may not agree with it, but
it -- it at least purports to be an interpretation of
the language rather than a general rule.
MR. WAXMAN: The fact -- the fact that the
arbitration clause -- the sentence has two clauses. One
says, you cannot bring a civil action in court about any
dispute under this agreement, you must settle your
disputes in arbitration, is completely orthodox.
And as we point out at page 24, note 3 of
our blue brief, it's quite arguably required by New
Jersey law and laws of other States that say to be
perfectly -- it is -- you have to be perfectly clear
when you are telling a contract -- a contracting
counterparty that disputes will be arbitrated. You have
to tell them that that means that they cannot bring
their disputes in court.
And a rule -- a reading of this -- I mean,
I -- I submit to you that, consistent with grammar and
ordinary meaning of words, it cannot be plausibly read
to say that you can't bring a civil action about any
dispute in court means that you can -- you are agreeing
to arbitrate your dispute on a class basis, for a whole
variety of reasons.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, could I just ask
you what you think the standard is under 10(a)(4)
because my understanding of the standard was that a
court had to find that an arbitrator was exceeding his
powers, was acting outside the scope of his authority --
MR. WAXMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN: And that we have said quite
a number of times that the fact that the arbitrator
committed an error and even a serious error is not
enough, that he had to be doing something that was
simply outside the scope of his authority. Do you agree
with that or disagree with that? And if you disagree
with that, what's your standard for what we should be
thinking about in -- under 10(a)(4).
MR. WAXMAN: I agree with that as a
proposition of what review is under 10(a)(4), that is
whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority. In this
case, in the context of the question about actual
agreement to arbitrate on a class -- as a class, this
Court has interpreted Federal law to require evidence of
a contractual basis of actual agreement between the
parties and has precluded, as a matter of Federal law,
an arbitrator from inferring such agreement from an
all-disputes clause.
JUSTICE KAGAN: And you don't disagree, do
you, that this arbitrator -- if you read his opinion,
you might think it's terribly wrong, but that what he's
doing is trying to construe a contract.
MR. WAXMAN: I think that -- I mean, trying
I think is not a defense. What I would say, in
addition --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but he is going -- but
he's looking at the words, that he's trying to figure
out what the parties agreed on when there's no explicit
statement about what the parties agreed on.
MR. WAXMAN: Right, but he did not take
cognizance of the holding of this Court in
Stolt-Nielsen, reiterated in Concepcion, that you may
not infer intent from an agreement to submit to
arbitration. And more fundamentally, he did not heed
the presumption in the Federal -- under the Federal
Arbitration Act that this Court's holdings in those two
cases reflects.
That is, there -- this Court said in
Concepcion that it would be hard to imagine that -- hard
to believe that defendants would ever bet the company
with no effective means of review.
There is therefore a presumption in the law
that, absent a very clear statement of a meeting of the
parties' minds there is no consent. But he indulged the
opposite presumption. His presumption was --
JUSTICE KAGAN: So now you're saying that he
exceeded his authority because he didn't apply a kind of
clear statement presumption. But I don't think that
we've ever suggested that there is such a clear
statement presumption. In Stolt-Nielsen, we said that
if the parties have stipulated that they haven't agreed
on anything, then we're not going to accept class
arbitration.
But we've not said that in the process of
construing an agreement there is a clear statement rule.
Now, maybe we should have said that, but -- you know,
it's -- it's no place in our case law now.
MR. WAXMAN: Justice Kagan --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Am I wrong?
MR. WAXMAN: We are not -- you didn't say
the words "clear statement." You -- what you said in
Stolt-Nielsen -- what you held in Stolt-Nielsen was not
simply that parties who have stipulated can't be forced
into class arbitration. What you held was that you
cannot have class arbitration in the absence of
affirmative agreement that is not evidenced by an
all-disputes clause. And the -- that background -- that
strong presumption must, as a matter of Federal law,
inform the arbitrator's decision.
And in this case, not only didn't it because
you said, look, an all-disputes clause doesn't suffice.
And he said, well, there's the word "civil action" in
here and I think that that not only suffices, but that
indicates an actual agreement to require class
arbitration. That doesn't pass any test. It doesn't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a combination of
the two provisions. He said that everything that is
excluded by the first provision is included in the
second. And he also said something, which may or may
not be so. He said that this particular way of
describing the -- the -- what's arbitrable, this is an
unusual wording. We have -- there's no civil action in
the first clause and then arbitration in the second. He
said that he had never seen this particular language.
Is he wrong in -- in saying that this language is
unusual?
MR. WAXMAN: Arbitration clauses that say,
in one form of words or another, that you may not bring
any dispute to court, you must bring all disputes to
arbitration, is -- is utterly commonplace. There was
a -- there was a clause in the Steelworkers' trilogy.
mean, they -- there's a lot of citation to Enterprise
Wheel in this case.
The -- the provision in -- in the
Steelworkers agreement, and virtually all labor
agreements, make this explicit. It's not precisely
every single article and preposition in the clause here,
but it is functionally indistinct. The same was true --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was this -- was this a --
well, was this an experienced arbitrator?
MR. WAXMAN: I -- so far as the record
shows, yes. But my -- whether he was right or wrong
about this, I submit to you two things: Number one,
there is no way -- three things:
Number one, there is no way consistent with
the rules of grammar that one can read this sentence as
sending class actions to arbitration -- requiring class
arbitration.
Number two, there is no heed by the
arbitrator -- Number two is that -- that for all intents
and purposes this clause is the clause that is orthodox,
that was at issue in Stolt-Nielsen. It's the same as
the one the Fifth Circuit decided and the Second Circuit
decided in the cases -- the other cases that created the
split here. It's the same as the standard labor clause
that was at issue in the Steelworkers v. Enterprise
Wheel.
And -- and this is my other point -- it is
plain from the arbitrator's decisions, both in his 2003
decision and in his post-Stolt-Nielsen 2010 decision, that
he not only was not applying the Federal law presumption
that this Court identified in Stolt and Concepcion, but
he was applying the opposite presumption.
He said in 2003 that because -- if this --
if this clause wouldn't be construed to permit or
require class arbitration, it would mean that the
parties had agreed not to resolve their disputes in any
forum using a class manner, and that would be, quote,
"so bizarre, it would require an express provision."
In 2010, he said, well, I overshot the mark
here. But the point is still the same. And this is on
page 41a -- 40a and 41a of the petition appendix. He
said, the -- the point is that if he is not allowed to
bring a class proceeding in arbitration when he at least
presumptively was in State court, that would be so
strange that, "If the clause," and I'm quoting from the
second full paragraph on 41a, "If the clause cannot
permit Dr. Sutter's court class action to go to
arbitration, then Dr. Sutter's original class action
must be outside of the arbitration agreement
altogether."
In other words, he was indulging a
presumption that it is so unnatural --
JUSTICE BREYER: That -- that comes under
our basic thing -- as I read this, the difference was
between this and Stolt-Nielsen, you have two parties
here and they both say, arbitrator, you decide whether
or not this language, that says nothing about it, did
encompass class or not.
In Stolt-Nielsen, the claimant, who wanted
arbitration, agreed that the clause said nothing about
it. So, given his concession there, the only way it
could have gotten in is if the arbitrator was doing some
policy thing. Given the lack of any similar concession
here, the way that the arbitrator got it in is he read
this ambiguous language, looked at the situation, and
said, hmm, guess it's in.
Now, in the latter case, we should presume
everything from the arbitrator's favor. Former case,
no, they've admitted that it wasn't in the clause.
Okay. So that -- now, what's the response to that?
MR. WAXMAN: So the arbitrator -- so a
couple of responses. The arbitrators in Stolt-Nielsen
didn't apply -- didn't construe AnimalFeeds' lawyers'
concession at oral argument before the arbitrators the
same way this Court did. What it said was that it is
looking at the language of the contract and as this
Court's majority opinion points out, there are several
textual references in the arbitrators' decision, and
they decided, well, we're interpreting this, applying, I
think they said, New York principles, that the parties
didn't agree to preclude it, therefore, they must be
understood to have permitted it.
What this Court said is, as a matter of law,
no. Silence doesn't mean consent. Consent can only be
shown in this type of decision by an actual agreement.
The Court italicized the word "agreement" twice in its
opinion. And it doesn't show actual agreement if you
just agree to arbitrate, not litigate, your disputes.
JUSTICE ALITO: Out of curiosity,
Mr. Waxman, in a case like this, how is the arbitrator
paid? Is the arbitrator paid by the hour or a flat fee?
MR. WAXMAN: I am not sure, Justice Alito,
if the record shows. I believe it's by the hour.
The -- the point is that what this
Court's -- the fact that there was a stipulation that
the Court identified in Stolt-Nielsen made it easier to
apply the principle that you -- that -- that actual
agreement is required, but you can't infer it from an
all-disputes clause to the case. The Court said that
the stipulation, quote, "left no room for an inquiry
regarding the parties' consent."
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, how wrong
does an arbitrator's decision have to be to become an
issue of law? Meaning -- because that's the rule you're
proposing. I used to think that exceeding your powers
was deciding an issue the parties hadn't agreed to
arbitrate, but here you've conceded that you gave the
issue to the arbitrator. So he hasn't exceeded his
power to construe the contract with respect to this
dispute, do you agree with that?
MR. WAXMAN: Yes, I do, but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So what
instead you're saying is that "exceeded your powers"
means that an error the arbitrator makes has to be of
what quality?
MR. WAXMAN: If you -- so if you -- an
arbitrator exceeds his powers if it -- if he decides to
arbitrate a subject matter that the parties have not
agreed to arbitrate. He -- he exceeds -- he or she
exceeds his or her power if they -- if he or she
decides, as this Court stated in Stolt-Nielsen, that you
agreed to arbitrate with someone with whom you didn't
agree to arbitrate. That is this case.
And as I said, we are not at the -- if you
asked -- I don't -- I would apply -- I think you could
simply apply the standard that you applied in
Stolt-Nielsen, which is the "leave no room" standard,
which is pretty darn deferential, and you would have to
find that this sentence, in light of Federal law as
announced by Stolt-Nielsen, leaves no room for a
conclusion that the parties, that Oxford and Dr. Sutter,
actually agreed to class arbitration regarding their
disputes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, of course, this
was -- this was an adhesion contract, so there's no --
it was drafted by Oxford. And you made a point about
betting the house, that the company wouldn't have agreed
to it. But on the side of the doctor, he has a
$10,000 -- a $1,000 claim, and he is saying that without
a class proceeding, there is -- there is essentially no
means to enforce the contract against Oxford, that none
of these parties, none of the, what was it, 13,000
doctors, none of them could enforce the contract because
the expense would be much greater than the $1,000 they
could get at the end.
MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, neither the
arbitrator nor any of the courts below made any finding
about whether this is a contract of adhesion or whether
this is a so-called negative value case.
There was litigation over Federal court
subject matter jurisdiction and the court found that
there was, in part based on evidence that Oxford
submitted, that there were many claims that were far in
excess of $75,000. And it is not true that Dr. Sutter's
claims as he brought them to arbitration was $1,000 or
anything like it.
May I reserve the balance of my time?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Katz?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. KATZ
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KATZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I would like to start out by discussing the
applicable standard. There are only two ways a losing
party can vacate an arbitration award under 10(a)(4),
which is the only standard that applies here. It's the
only question that came up to this Court on cert and --
under the exceeding powers standard. Number one, the
arbitrator had no authority to interpret the contract;
or number 2, the award was based not on an
interpretation of the contract.
Oxford cannot satisfy either of those
standards here. Oxford does not dispute that the
arbitrator interpreted the contract. Oxford's sole
dispute here or challenge is that the -- that the
arbitrator interpreted the contract incorrectly.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's all he has
to do is saying -- you know, I'm -- I'm interpreting the
contract, and whatever he says is okay then, right?
MR. KATZ: Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we were
concerned in Stolt-Nielsen about a -- a -- a company
betting the company, right, on -- on class action
whenever -- whenever it agrees to arbitration because
class arbitration -- you know, will bankrupt the company
and without an appeal to the court or -- you know,
not -- not -- not much of an appeal anyway. And you're
saying that, in effect, you do bet the company every
time.
So long as you leave it up to the arbitrator
to decide whether there's a class action allowed or not,
which most agreements probably do, he can find whatever
he likes, right? He can find -- so long as he says, I'm
interpreting the agreement, it can be as wildly
inconsistent with the agreement as you like and there's
nothing the courts can do about it.
MR. KATZ: Justice Scalia, Stolt-Nielsen
taught us that the language of the contract or any other
evidence has to demonstrate the -- that the parties
agreed to class arbitration. Stolt-Nielsen did not
alter this 10(a)(4) standard, the same standard which
before it was codified --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that standard
-- all that standard means is that the arbitrator has to
say is, I am interpreting the contract, even though what
he says is flatly, visibly, unquestionably contrary to
what the contract says, and the court has to accept
that, so long as he says, I'm interpreting the contract.
MR. KATZ: This Court's jurisprudence for
almost 2 centuries has held just exactly that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Just exactly that?
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't think so.
thought it said that -- that the award -- if the award
displays manifest disregard, or words like that. I
mean, Misco is -- is not absolute. Misco has a narrow
exception, and that exception is where there's just no
basis in the contract for the decision. And so I
thought you were arguing that here that's clearly not
so, there is a basis.
MR. KATZ: Well, there -- well, there is a
basis. What Misco -- as I understand what Misco teaches
is that it has to be unambiguous, that the arbitrator --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's a different thing,
that's a different thing. It doesn't say whatever he
says about the contract, he wins. It says what he says
about the contract, it is not just manifestly wrong, it
isn't just plain language to the contrary, and et
cetera. There is language in the cases to that effect.
So I would be repeating myself, but are you saying there
is no loophole no matter how tiny? That's news to me.
MR. KATZ: Well, Justice Breyer, I don't
think manifest disregard -- certainly, manifest
disregard is not a standard by which this matter has
come up before the Court. And this Court has held in
Hall Street and other cases that 10(a)(4) is the
exclusive ground set forth by Congress, that this Court
did not have the authority -- and I'm quoting the
Court -- it "did not have the authority to expand."
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose I
think, since I wrote the words in First Options, that
something like manifest disregard or totally ignoring
plain law is a ground for reversing an arbitrator, even
an arbitrator. Now, suppose I think that. Then do I
decide against you?
MR. KATZ: No, Justice Breyer, because here
both sides, not only in 2003, but in 2010 after
Stolt-Nielsen, came to the arbitrator and said, we want
you to decide it. They told the arbitrator at that
time, look at the agreement, look at what transpired in
02, back when this matter was in the superior court
and make your decision.
So the arbitrator applied the law that --
and applied the -- the standard that he was told to
apply. He didn't just disregard it. He didn't make a
decision saying, I don't care what you are telling me to
JUSTICE SCALIA: What supports his decision?
I mean, you -- you say that. What -- what supports his
decision that the parties here agreed, agreed, that's
the standard. Did they agree to class arbitration?
What -- what supports that?
MR. KATZ: Justice Scalia, they did agree.
When we were in court in 2002, Oxford represented to the
State court judge there that not only are the disputes
going to arbitration, but all actions regarding the
disputes.
And the judge specifically relied upon that,
expressly relied upon that, in not sending just the
disputes, but sending everything that had been asserted
by Dr. Sutter, including the claims of the class. And
the arbitrator --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. There
is a distinction between all disputes and all actions
relating to the dispute?
MR. KATZ: Oxford made that distinction in
02. In fact -- and we point this out in our brief on
page 5, the red brief, where Oxford has expressly --
it's both on page 5 and page 6 and I will refer to page
, the top of 6. This is Oxford's counsel in 2002.
"The contract" --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The top of page 6?
MR. KATZ: The top of page 6, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MR. KATZ: Plaintiff quoted the contract
here as saying "that any dispute under the contract
needs to be arbitrated." That's wrong, the contract
says "actions concerning any dispute." That was what
Oxford has always argued at all times before the
arbitrator. The arbitrator understood that.
The arbitrator interpreted the agreement.
It's based both on the agreement and on the
representations made by Oxford as to what its own
agreement meant.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's
inconsistent with the law that's developed -- actually
in fairness to the arbitrator, after he'd made his
initial decision, which is that if you have something
that just says disputes and doesn't address the issue of
class arbitration at all, that you can't have class
arbitration.
MR. KATZ: The arbitrator, however,
Mr. Chief Justice, cannot be faulted or -- or his award
vacated based upon changes or arguments that were never
made at the time. The parties made their arguments to
the arbitrator. Oxford, if you will, sat on the
sidelines.
And this Court has also held that a party cannot
sit on the sidelines, wait till the award comes down,
and when it's against them then raise new arguments for
the first time. Oxford --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you get
back -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
MR. KATZ: I'm sorry. I was just going to
finish saying, Oxford could have raised these arguments
and maybe at the end of the day, if they raised those
arguments, they would have carried the day.
But I respectfully submit, as this Court has
repeatedly held, that courts do not have the authority
to second-guess the arbitrator and make decisions or
come up with a resolution that would have been different
with the arbitrator just because they disagree.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Getting back to
Justice Breyer's question, I thought his -- First
Options is fairly strong authority for him because there
you have a situation with the arbitrator determining
that a particular entity or individual is bound by the
agreement. And we said that's something that we will
review de novo, without deference. Why isn't it the
same here?
In other words, not everything an arbitrator
says is subject to the deferential standard of review,
even if he purports to say I'm interpreting the
agreement, which I think the arbitrator in First Options
did?
MR. KATZ: Here, Mr. Chief Justice, the
arbitrator did exactly what the parties had asked him to
do, though. He did not venture and do something outside
of what the parties had asked him.
The parties specifically presented the
question to the arbitrator as to whether class
arbitrations were available and specifically directed
the arbitrator both to the agreement -- the language in
the agreement, as well as the representations and the
submissions that were made below in the court system in
making their respective arguments.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I see --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that Oxford
conceded that it did not preserve any question of
entitlement to de novo review.
MR. KATZ: That is correct. Oxford has
always maintained that it was the arbitrator's decision
to make, and in 2010, even after Stolt-Nielsen, came
back to the arbitrator and asked the arbitrator to
reconsider his opinion from 2003. The -- Oxford had
never, until after losing this case obviously, has
Oxford sought the Court for the first time for a de novo
interpretation.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -- counsel, you
seem -- I don't know. I see two questions here. The
first was an arbitrator exceeds his power if he decides
a question is arbitral when it's not. And -- but here
there is no dispute about that because you are right,
your adversary submitted this question to arbitration.
And that's what I'm hearing you respond. He did,
there's no question, he said the arbitrator has to
decide this issue.
Justice Breyer raised the second question.
Assuming he could, is there any remaining power in the
Court to overturn his decision? And Justice Breyer
said, if the standard is manifest disregard of fact and
law, why would you still win?
Because your adversary is saying, the law is
clear. You have to find some hook in the agreement to
agree to class action -- arbitration, and he says there
is none. That's basically his position, that the
arbitrator's decision on its substance manifestly
disregarded the law. So that's the question that I
believe is extant still.
MR. KATZ: Answering that -- answering that
hypothetical, assuming that was --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Was it a hypothetical?
(Laughter.)
MR. KATZ: Well, if there was a manifest
disregard --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I want to say why
there wasn't. I want you to explain why there wasn't
one.
MR. KATZ: Well, the arbitrator did not
manifestly disregard. The arbitrator did what the
parties wanted the arbitrator to do.
JUSTICE BREYER: Look, I'm going to say
something and you are going to say, that's right, that's
just what I wanted, and that won't do me any good if you
don't think of it. The arbitrator in front of me, so
you better tell me why I'm wrong because they certainly
will and they are in the briefs.
Mr. Arbitrator, this class -- this language
here says all disputes will go to arbitration. It
doesn't say whether they are supposed to be class or can
be or can't be. You decide what it means.
And the arbitrator thinks, hmm, all, hmm, it
doesn't say, but I got to reach a decision. So what
kind of a case is it? Small claims. And then it says
something about court suits where they have class. Hmm,
gets his magic 8-ball out and, whatever it is, he says,
that's what it means. It means it could include class,
too. Okay?
Where in our case law is that a manifest
disregard? He's looked at the language, there were two
plausible constructions, he came up with one of them.
What's the problem? Now, that's of course their
problem, but if you just say yes and don't go into why
they are saying no it's not going to help me.
MR. KATZ: Well, I don't believe that is --
Justice Breyer, I don't believe that is a manifest
disregard.
JUSTICE BREYER: So -- obviously you don't.
(Laughter.)
MR. KATZ: And the reason being is that the
arbitrator based his determination on the standards or
the materials that were put forth before him, the
agreement and the evidence, and he made a decision.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not enough. As
stated by Justice Breyer, he has to have come to a
plausible construction. It's not enough that he said,
I'm construing the contract. I have looked at the terms
of the contract and what the parties' said, and my
construction of the contract is X. That's not enough.
It has to be plausible.
MR. KATZ: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, why is this plausible?
MR. KATZ: Well, with all due respect,
Justice Scalia, I don't think plausibility comes into
play.
JUSTICE BREYER: Use whatever word you want.
Manifest disregard, stick to the law. Now, suppose the
arbitrator had said this, it doesn't say how to do it.
I see how you do it, you get out a magic 8-ball. Now,
we would strike that down because that is not relevant.
But he didn't say magic 8-ball. He said class. And
there are many class arbitrations. So it isn't quite
magic 8-ball.
Now, you explain to me --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's a magic 8-ball?
don't know what you are talking about.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: A magic 8-ball is you
have -- that's a little thing, it's the -- it's a
non-sportsman's equivalent of throwing darts.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why don't you, Mr. Katz,
why don't you concentrate on what the arbitrator himself
said? Mr. Waxman said this clause wasn't unusual, but
the arbitrator said, I've never seen anything like this.
MR. KATZ: Justice Ginsburg, what the
arbitrator had found was that the "no civil action" part
of the clause was -- was coextensive. It was completely
interrelated with the mandatory arbitration provision.
In other words, what the arbitrator found was that
everything that was prohibited from being filed in a
litigation in the court had to be arbitrated, and that
was based on not only --
JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a question on
something a little bit different? Did the arbitrator
have -- how many parties were there to this agreement?
There is Oxford on one side and how many doctors on the
other side?
MR. KATZ: Well, this specific agreement was
Dr. Sutter and Oxford, but there are 20,000 physicians
who had signed the same agreement.
JUSTICE ALITO: All right, so 20,000. And
the effect of the arbitrator's decision is that all of
those 20,000 doctors are deemed to have agreed to class
arbitration, right?
MR. KATZ: Correct.
JUSTICE ALITO: And if we assume -- if I ask
you to assume, for the sake of argument, that this
agreement does not constitute an agreement to engage in
class arbitration, where did the arbitrator get the
authority to make that holding with respect to all of
these absent class members?
MR. KATZ: Well, the arbitrate --
JUSTICE ALITO: If they didn't agree to
class arbitration, how can they -- and they didn't agree
to have the arbitrator decide whether the agreement
calls for -- for class arbitration. How did he purport
to bind them to that decision?
MR. KATZ: Well, the arbitrator made the
decision based on the language and the evidence
presented before him and finding that it authorized
class arbitration. That was the determination that was
made initially.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the -- is the contract
authorized it as for Dr. Sutter, all of the others are
similarly situated, they got the same contracts?
MR. KATZ: They all -- they all had the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So either the contract
means what the arbitrator said it meant or it doesn't.
If it means what the arbitrator said it meant, then
everybody's bound.
MR. KATZ: That -- that is correct. Now,
ultimately, when the matter was certified --
JUSTICE ALITO: Wait a minute. Where did he
get the authority to make that decision to interpret the
contract with respect to them?
MR. KATZ: Well, the --
JUSTICE ALITO: You're saying he can do it
with respect to Oxford because Oxford agreed to have the
arbitrator decide whether this calls for class
arbitration. But these other people didn't. They
didn't agree to have the arbitrator decide whether it
calls for class arbitration.
MR. KATZ: Well, Justice Alito, this -- this
is no different than in any other contract
interpretation issue. The arbitrator makes a
determination based upon the reading of the language and
what the parties are telling him that language means.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the difference
is in First Options. The one thing First Options says
is the question of who's going to be bound by
arbitration is decided by the court de novo. And in the
class context, you are binding 19,999 individuals who
did not agree to be bound, depending upon the particular
interpretation.
MR. KATZ: But Stolt-Nielsen, which the
arbitrator faithfully reviewed, analyzed, and followed,
makes clear that you can have class arbitration as long
as the arbitrator determines that the contracting
parties to that agreement establish that class
arbitration is available.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Did these other people
agree to this arbitrator? I mean, they might have said,
this arbitrator, he's a wild guy, he's going to say
that -- that we agreed to class action. We didn't agree
to class -- I don't want this arbitrator.
They didn't agree to this arbitrator. Why
should they be bound by -- by whatever he says?
MR. KATZ: Well, for one thing,
Justice Scalia, that's exactly what Oxford wanted.
Oxford argued that the class action should go into
arbitration.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could they -- could they
opt out?
MR. KATZ: Well, ultimately, they could --
they could opt out when it was certified. And I want
to -- I'd like to be clear on a point, if I may.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How can they opt out if
they've agreed to class arbitration?
MR. KATZ: Well, they can opt out of the
class and pursue, if they wanted to at that point, an
individual arbitration if that's what they chose to do.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you sure? It seems to
me if they've agreed to class arbitration, they've
agreed to class arbitration.
MR. KATZ: Well, they -- they proceeded --
they agreed for the matter to proceed as a class
proceeding. But the matters --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And those -- and there
are rules that governed that, right?
MR. KATZ: That is correct, Justice
Ginsburg. That is before we get to the issue of whether
the class itself be certified.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but how could --
how could they opt out if the arbitrator said -- says,
as Justice Scalia and Justice Alito are suggesting, we
have -- I have jurisdiction to decide this case. I
decide that there is a class action, all these people
are in the class.
MR. KATZ: Justice Kennedy, the
determination that this matter could proceed as a class
arbitration was only the first issue that was decided.
We then engaged in the procedural mechanism by which the
matter could be certified and that they could --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, presumably they could
opt out, but did they agree to be bound by this unless
they opted out? That's not the usual way people are
bound by litigations.
MR. KATZ: But everyone, Justice Alito,
everyone signs the same agreement. And therefore, if
the arbitrator's going to make a determination here --
JUSTICE ALITO: No, but I think you're --
you're not -- you're not accepting my assumption that
this is an incorrect interpretation of the contract.
That's the assumption. This is incorrect. If we were
reviewing this as an appellate court reviewing the
interpretation of the contract under Stolt-Nielsen, we
would say, this is wrong. This is really wrong. Okay?
Assume that to be the case.
Then how are they -- how are these absent
people bound? And it's really not an answer to say,
well, they can opt out. If they didn't agree to be
bound by this arbitrator's decision, then they didn't
agree to be bound absent by opting out, which is an
unusual procedure for being bound by an agreement.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would never have
class action arbitration if that were so.
MR. KATZ: If -- if it was --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be impossible
because you could never get in advance -- they find out
that by getting notice and then they decide whether they
want to stay with it or opt out.
MR. KATZ: Well, in any class arbitration,
the arbitrator is not going to decide the same questions
as to the 20,000 of the same agreements. It's decided
based upon the class representative who brings the
matter.
And even if the arbitrator was wrong,
Justice Alito, I submit that under 10(a)(4) in the
applicable standard, that even in Concepcion, this Court
said 10(a)(4) is -- is not an issue of mistake, it's an
issue of misconduct. And that's not what we have here.
If there was a mistake, that still would not be enough
with respect to the courts to have vacated the
arbitrator's determination on this matter.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And this may not --
I'm not sure it's relevant, but it -- it might be. I
thought the purpose of arbitration was to decide these
things quickly. This has been going on 11 years, right?
(Laughter.)
MR. KATZ: This has been going on 11 years.
That is true. It's been going on --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not -- it's not
a facetious question because I think one of the concerns
about class arbitration is that it -- it eliminates the
supposed benefits of arbitration because you can't have
sort of quick and rough and ready determinations when
it's going to bind 20,000 people.
MR. KATZ: Well, class arbitration is, as in
many arbitrations in this day and age, involves complex
issues, that sometimes you have major corporations doing
battle over -- over major agreements that they know at
the time involved big ticket items.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask -- ask
you this question because I think it's consistent with
the answer you're giving to the Chief Justice, a little
bit different, though. Suppose you have -- and this is
a hypothetical case, this is not this case because I
don't know the facts. Suppose you have an attorney in a
small town, well respected, doesn't have a great big
practice, and he's chosen as the arbitrator.
And if he arbitrates the one case, he's
going to get a fee of, I don't know, $10,000. He
says -- you know, if this is a class arbitration, I can
keep this going for 11 years, I will make a million
dollars.
Does he have the obligation to say, I'm
going to decide the class action issue under this theory
that is decided here, and after I do that, since I have
a conflict, I'll bow out. I'll just say, there is a
class action, and then I will leave it for some other
arbitrator. Does he have that obligation? And if he
doesn't, should that bear on our decision here?
MR. KATZ: Justice Kennedy, that should not
bear on the decision here because this matter comes up
under 10(a)(4). If there were questions about the
partiality of the arbitrator, then I want to rule in
favor of Katz because I want to prolong this thing as
long as possible, then perhaps Oxford should have
brought the matter under 10(a)(2) and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How long -- can we
straighten out this 11 years? How many years was this
in the New Jersey courts before there was ever an
arbitrator appointed?
MR. KATZ: Well, the matter wasn't in the
New Jersey courts for that long, but various points in
time because the AAA rules allow for a -- a filing of
a Federal suit to vacate Oxford, on multiple
occasions --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but tell me why --
why is that a factor or not a factor in -- in our
decision? That should not be a factor in our decision?
MR. KATZ: Partiality is not a factor,
Justice Kennedy --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but surely --
MR. KATZ: -- in this decision.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Finish
your answer.
MR. KATZ: In this decision, because
partiality or what could potentially be perceived as a
subjective intent, so the arbitrator does not play under
(a)(4).
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But under --
under -- that provision, the partiality provision, is
addressed to favoring one party as opposed to another
party.
I think Justice Kennedy's question goes to
an institutional concern about an arbitrator making a
decision of this sort that goes, not to -- not to
partiality between parties, but a problem about the way
the system would work, that would create an incentive
for an arbitrator, implicit or explicit, to reach a
ruling that expands his authority.
MR. KATZ: Well, arbitrators -- I would
submit that an arbitrator who was doing something that
was -- that was documented or perceived to be crazy --
and pardon my vernacular -- or just way out of line,
then I'd submit that arbitrator is not going to be hired
again.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many -- how -- what
is the history of class actions and arbitrations? There
are at least enough of them so that the AAA has a set of
rules about how you handle class arbitrations, right?
MR. KATZ: That's correct. I think it's
important -- if I could just address a couple of points
regarding that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How many have there been?
Have there been dozens, hundreds, thousands?
MR. KATZ: Well, I don't know --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any idea?
MR. KATZ: Well -- I don't think there has
been thousands, but there -- I know there have certainly
been a number so far that the American Arbitration
Association has set forth rules --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure there's been a
number. What's the number?
MR. KATZ: I -- I don't -- I don't know the
number.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It could be less than 100?
MR. KATZ: I wouldn't know that,
Justice Scalia.
But -- if I may point this out, class
arbitrations were certainly in existence at the time
that this matter was sent into class arbitration. And
in fact, I think it's also worthy to understand that
when I brought this matter in superior court, I argued
that the class action should be kept in court, but it
was Oxford's argument that everything including the
class action go into arbitration.
It was Oxford's interpretation of its own
clause that the arbitrator relied upon, which puts this
case completely outside of Stolt-Nielsen, where in
Stolt-Nielsen, the arbitrator fashioned his -- their own
rules based on some policy preference about arbitrations
-- about class actions which wasn't present here.
And if I could address an issue that was
raised about -- that the arbitrator discussed something
was bizarre. In 2003, that was a pre- -- so that
was prior to Stolt-Nielsen -- the arbitrator expressly
disavowed that in his 2010 opinion. And he made it very
clear that he based his decision on the interpretation
of the agreement as well as the representations made as
to what that agreement meant to the court system.
I think this Court has recognized for 2
centuries that an arbitrator's error in law or fact
cannot be the grounds for a vacatur.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry to just
interrupt. For most of that two centuries, courts
refused to enforce arbitration agreements. That's the
whole reason we have the FAA.
MR. KATZ: But here, both sides, Mr. Chief
Justice, expressly asked the arbitrator. This is not a
question of arbitrability because both sides wanted the
arbitrator to make that decision. Then even after 2010,
when it came to light that Bazzle -- there was a
plurality and the issue of whether it's a question of
arbitrability is an open question, Oxford didn't go
running to court then.
Instead, it went back to the arbitrator and
said, we want you to reconsider your 2003 decision. And
the arbitrator again went through the analysis of
interpreting the agreement and the representations made
by the parties about what that agreement meant.
I submit we have to -- if we trust
arbitrators to handle such important issues as civil
rights issues and other very important matters of
singular importance, we have to expect that they will
follow the precepts of this Court and the FAA as to what
constitutes grounds for class arbitration.
I think the Third Circuit should be
affirmed, if there are no other questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Katz.
Mr. Waxman, you have 2 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WAXMAN: Thank you.
I have three points, two small ones and one
significant one.
The first small one is that this notion,
this canard, that we told the district -- the State
court judge that class actions should be sent to
arbitration is dispensed with on pages 13 and 14 of our
reply brief, following the sentence, "Tellingly, Sutter
resorts in part to misrepresenting Oxford's previous
positions."
And I refer the Court again specifically to
footnote 7 on page 14, where we quote my brother's
statements to the State court judge explaining that what
we were asking for was, quote, "a motion to compel
individual arbitration."
The second small point goes to the issue of
what the number is of class arbitrations. I also don't
know that. But we know that as of this Court's decision
in Stolt-Nielsen because this was reported in the AAA
amicus brief, that not a single final decision had been
rendered prior to -- as of the time of Stolt-Nielsen, in
any class arbitration.
The AAA class arbitration rules were adopted
after this Court's decision in Bazzle, which left open
the possibility, a possibility that the arbitrator in
this case said was surprising because the arbitrator
said quite correctly that everyone expected that in
Bazzle this Court would say there's no such thing as
class arbitration.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your significant
point?
(Laughter.)
MR. WAXMAN: I can't go back 200 years, but
let's just go to 1960 in terms of the standard. And in
the Steelworkers v. the Enterprise Wheel case, what this
Court held was, quote, "An award is legitimate only so
long as it draws its essence from the agreement. When
the arbitrator's words manifest an infidelity to this
obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse
enforcement of the award."
And our submission is that this award, the
conclusion that the all-disputes provision here
manifested an actual agreement by the parties to class
arbitration, cannot possibly be reconciled with the
plain language or Stolt-Nielsen's holding.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Waxman. Counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the
