CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
next in House v. Bell.
Mr. Kissinger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. KISSINGER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KISSINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it
please the Court:
The jurors which --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why don't you raise the
level of the podium a little so we can hear you?
MR. KISSINGER: Is that better, Your Honor?
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Not much.
MR. KISSINGER: One more sound check. Does
that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.
MR. KISSINGER: Thank you.
The jurors who convicted Mr. House of first
degree murder heard that semen stains on the victim's
clothing matched Mr. House. They didn't hear the DNA
evidence which showed that not to be the case.
The jurors heard --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was that because there was
no such analysis at the time?
MR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice
O'Connor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: How many years ago was
this trial?
MR. KISSINGER: The trial, Your Honor, was
approximately 20 years ago.
The jurors who convicted Mr. House heard that
bloodstains on Mr. House's blue jeans matched the blood
belonging to the victim. They didn't hear the
assistant chief medical examiner for the State of
Tennessee testify that the source of those bloodstains
was a sample taken during Ms. Muncey's autopsy, nor did
they hear --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The district court heard
that, though, didn't it?
MR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice
Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And didn't believe it.
Right? And did not believe it. Found as a matter of
fact that the blood was -- was not a result of the
spill.
MR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, the court
made a conclusion that the blood which had spilt from
the tube had spilt after -- after the blood had been
tested. It did not, however, make a factual finding.
It made a conclusion of law regarding that, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- is that a conclusion
of law?
MR. KISSINGER: It is, Your Honor. If the
Court were to look at the district court order, the
district court order was divided into two distinct
parts. The first part --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care what part it
put it in. The district court did not believe that the
blood on the trousers was a consequence of the spill
and that -- and that, therefore, blood was identified
on the inside of his trousers that was the blood of the
victim. That's what the district court believed,
having heard the testimony.
MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, what the district
-- what the district court concluded as a matter of law
was that it -- that notwithstanding Dr. Blake's
testimony regarding the source of the blood found on
Mr. House's jeans, that that did not eliminate the --
eliminate the testimony of Agent Scott who said that he
saw blood on the jeans when he first -- excuse me. Let
me rephrase that because it's actually a critical
matter. He saw what he thought appeared to be
bloodstains on the jeans when he first picked them up.
What the district court did in that instance
was exactly the error that Mr. House has brought to the
attention of this Court, which is in the face of
evidence of innocence, the district court, simply
because it found some contrary evidence in the record,
found that Mr. House had failed to make his showing.
JUSTICE SCALIA: On that point -- on that one
point, do you contend that the district court was
clearly erroneous?
MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: On that one point of the
blood, of whether, indeed, his blood was on -- or the
victim's blood was on the inside of his trousers? On
that one point, do you claim that the district court
was clearly erroneous?
MR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, we actually
make two claims regarding that. First, that that was a
conclusion of law entitled to -- entitled to de novo
review. Second, that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's your -- what's your
second point? Because I --
MR. KISSINGER: Second, Justice Scalia, if
indeed it was a finding of fact, yes, that finding of
fact was clearly erroneous.
JUSTICE SCALIA: On the basis solely of the
testimony of -- of this expert.
MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, on the basis of
the entirety of the record, which is what this Court
instructed the district court to examine when it
conducts a Schlup inquiry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Including the contrary
testimony that said if it had been the result of a
spill, it would not have been splattered all over, as
it was here. Some of it wouldn't have been on the
inside of the trousers. Some of it wouldn't have been
mixed with mud. Despite all of that, you -- you can
say that the district court's finding, which I consider
a finding of fact, was clearly erroneous.
MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, including not
only that testimony, but the testimony of the same
expert who made the statements which the Court just
cited, who said that she was unable -- that she was
excluding merely the direct spillage, the pouring of
blood onto the jeans, and conceded in her testimony
that the transfer stains which she observed, the type
of stains which she observed could, in fact, have been
-- that she had no opinion as to the cause of those,
only that it was the result of one object wiping
against another object.
Also, in light of the testimony in regarding --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I -- I agree
that all of this stuff would -- would have made a
better case for the defendant here. But once the case
has been tried and both sides have put on all the
evidence they have, we have a -- a much different test,
and -- and that is whether any reasonable juror could
have found him guilty. That's a very heavy burden:
whether any reasonable jury could have found guilt. I
agree it would have been a much closer case, but -- but
the burden you -- you have before us here is to
establish that no reasonable jury could possibly have
found him guilty.
MR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And on -- just on the blood
thing alone, I -- I find that a hard burden to bear.
MR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, there --
there are two things which come into the -- into the
Court's analysis.
First is the Court is correct. The burden is
quite high, and it's -- it's high for a reason. It's
justifiably high. We don't shrink from that burden,
Your Honor.
What we say is that along with that burden,
the Court also requires that the entirety of the
evidence be reviewed. If the entirety of the evidence
is reviewed and the effect of the entirety of the
evidence on a properly instructed, reasonable juror --
that's the nature of the -- the determination -- what
effect will that have? When we look at the facts in
this case, when we look at the blood evidence in this
case, yes, we don't deny that there is evidence which
could support conviction. However, that is not the
test in Schlup. Schlup specifically rejected that
inquiry.
JUSTICE BREYER: What did it rest on? What
-- what is the district court's conclusion? The court
concludes that the spillage occurred after the FBI
crime lab received and tested the evidence. What does
that rest on?
MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, quite frankly, we
can't determine that -- that statement rests on
anything. The undisputed evidence in the record
consists of a photograph of the blood samples at the
time they were received by the defense expert. The box
was opened. A photograph was taken. The photograph
shows clearly that one entire tube of blood is missing
and the second tube of blood has leaked within the
packaging.
But the record also contains the testimony of
the TBI agent who transported the blood from the FBI to
the defense expert who said he observed no blood that
leaked other than the -- other than what was inside the
container.
It also contains the testimony of the FBI
agent who tested the blood at the FBI who said two
things. One, I used no -- no more than one quarter of
a tube of blood and that no blood spilt while the tube
was in the possession of the FBI.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And it also contained the
testimony of an expert who said that if the tube
spilled in that way, it would not have created the kind
of spatterings that -- that were incriminating in this
case. Even if there was some spill, it would not have
produced the kind of spattering. So, you know, I call
that a draw.
MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, two -- two things
to -- two things to point out there. First is that
that eliminates only one possible hypothesis and that
is the hypothesis that blood was directly spilt onto --
onto the -- onto the jeans. I think the example that
the expert gave was these are not stains, for example,
the pouring of a -- like coffee -- pouring coffee onto
the lap of your jeans or something like that. These
are simply transfers: one bloody object wiped against
another.
So while she gave a hypothesis of guilt --
and again, Your Honor, it comes to the could and would
distinction. Yes, it -- that could be considered
evidence of guilt, what would a -- but, however, that's
not the inquiry. The inquiry is what would a
reasonable juror who heard that on one side, that it
didn't spill directly, but on the other side, heard the
evidence that we began -- that I began to discuss with
Justice Breyer, which is the evidence of the TBI agent,
the photographic evidence, the evidence of the FBI
agent, the evidence that the Styrofoam box was opened
during transit to the FBI and that objects were removed
from it during transit.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have two questions on the
blood, and there's a lot you want to cover here, so I
won't take too much of your time.
One, is it significant for your case that
this was a very small sample?
Two, was the evidence about the enzymatic
degradation -- was that available? Was the science
about that fully available to the defense at the time
of trial?
I had those two questions.
MR. KISSINGER: Justice Kennedy, in terms of
the -- the size of -- of the bloodstains, it was
significant to the extent that it bears upon the
probative value of the testimony of Charles Scott when
he says -- when he said he saw what he thought might be
stains. As a simple matter of fact, this -- the jeans
were stained with a number of substances, not just
blood, and a number of witnesses, including the trial
prosecutor himself, described the bloodstains as
actually so small that they were difficult to detect by
the human eye.
The second part of your question, Justice
Kennedy, yes. That evidence was available. And our
position is that it -- that goes actually to the
substance of our constitutional ineffective assistance
of counsel claim. Trial counsel had in his possession
-- or his expert certainly had in his possession the
photograph that showed an entire tube of blood missing.
Therefore, he had evidence that there was something
wrong with the blood. Trial counsel was actually
concerned about this blood. He filed a pretrial motion
to suppress this blood evidence. Here's trial counsel
with evidence that blood is missing. He knows it's a
critical issue in the case and he failed to go out and
hire someone like the assistant chief medical examiner
for the State of Tennessee who came into Federal court
and testified as to the -- that the source of this
blood was, in fact, that empty tube.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that would be an
important point if, in fact, it conclusively
established that the blood was not the blood of the
victim, but I don't think it does conclusively
establish that, and if it doesn't, the -- the less than
perfect performance of counsel is -- is no basis for
setting aside the conviction.
MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, two matters on
that. Again, the proof of innocence does not have to
be absolute. This Court stated in Schlup that the fact
that there is still some evidence of guilt or that
there still exists even substantial evidence of guilt
does not prevent a defendant from passing through the
Schlup gateway.
The second matter and one which I think is
important is that as a matter of Tennessee law, a
circumstantial evidence case requires not only that the
prosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt,
but that it eliminate all reasonable hypotheses of
innocence. So even if a jury could conclude that the
blood came during -- that the blood got on the jeans
during the course of the crime, it would also have to
be able -- it would also have to be probable that the
same jury would also conclude that it was an
impossibility for Mr. Blake -- Dr. Blake's testimony to
--
be correct. So, in fact, it's Dr. Blake's testimony
which has to be impossible to -- to accept in order for
a jury to find --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: At one point--
MR. KISSINGER: -- a reasonable juror to find
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Scalia said blood
of the victim. You don't contest that this was the
blood of the victim. The question is at what point did
it get transferred to the jeans.
MR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice
Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's no question about
it being someone else's blood.
MR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice
Ginsburg. The question has been, from the beginning of
this case, when the blood came to get on Mr. House's
jeans.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And -- and the point
of controversy is whether a spill of -- of the -- of
the blood in -- in the course of transport could have
produced this -- this kind of -- of spattering,
including a spattering on the inside of -- of the
trousers near the button. It -- it seems to me
unlikely, and -- and I am unable to say that no
reasonable jury -- juror could not think it unlikely.
MR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, I -- I would
disagree with -- with the Court's analysis there. I --
I think what -- what the issue here is more whether,
given the testimony of Dr. Blake, given the
corroborating evidence that supports Dr. Blake's
testimony, would a reasonable juror have doubts or
would any reasonable juror have a -- retain a
reasonable -- excuse me --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's much more than that.
MR. KISSINGER: Let me rephrase that, Justice
Scalia. The question is, given the Tennessee jury
instruction --
JUSTICE BREYER: Any reasonable juror would
have had to have a reasonable doubt.
MR. KISSINGER: Yes, thank you, Justice
Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And you're
saying yes, any reasonable juror would have had to have
a reasonable doubt irrespective of what the trial judge
found.
MR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice
Breyer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- so the --
we would have to be finding in this case, if we ruled
in your favor, that we think the trial judge is
unreasonable.
MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, that's actually
not correct either. Schlup specifically says that the
function of the district judge in a Schlup hearing is
not to make an independent judgment on the evidence in
front of him, but to make a probabilistic determination
of the effect of the evidence on a reasonable juror.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, but surely he's supposed
to make factual determinations. We -- I -- I don't
want to make factual determinations on all these
questions. That's -- that's not our system of law.
Those factual determinations are made by the trial
judge. And here, I agree with you that we don't have
to accept his judgment as to what a reasonable juror
would have done, but I do think that we have to accept
his factual findings as accurate unless they're clearly
erroneous. And here, he made the factual finding that
that blood was there before the transport. And I -- I
think I'm bound by that unless you can show that it is
clearly erroneous, which I don't think you can.
MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, first, we -- we
believe we have -- have shown that it's clearly
erroneous.
Second, even viewing the blood evidence
separately, even saying, well, Mr. House has put up
some evidence of -- some evidence of innocence
regarding this blood evidence, but not enough to really
sway me regarding that, that evidence itself has to be
viewed in light of the entire record. And in light of
the entire record, that blood evidence, standing alone
in its even somewhat compromised state, no reasonable
juror would be able to come to the conclusion that Mr.
House was guilty because the remaining evidence of his
innocence is also very substantial.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you going to mention
any of the other, or are we going to just deal with the
blood today?
MR. KISSINGER: Justice O'Connor, we -- we
would like to move on to -- to some of the other
evidence because it -- it is substantial. And we've
set -- we've set out a lot of that evidence beginning
at page 6 of our reply brief.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Will you also cover,
because your time is short, if you get through the
gateway on your actual innocence contention, what are
your constitutional claims that lie behind it? Because
I don't think much was said about that in the briefing.
What is it that you would -- you would say if you got
through the gate?
MR. KISSINGER: Justice Ginsburg, as -- as I
mentioned earlier, we believe that we have numerous
instances of ineffective assistance of counsel. First,
counsel's failure to -- upon knowing of the importance
of the blood evidence, which he clearly did because he
raised -- raised the issue himself, upon knowing of the
photograph showing the missing blood, he failed to go
forward and basically do what we did in Federal court,
which was hire an expert to look at the results of the
FBI testing and to determine whether there was a viable
defense -- a viable defense strategy available there,
which he did not.
Also, if we look at the record in this case,
we have a situation where trial counsel also pointed
toward Hubert Muncey, Jr. as the actual perpetrator of
this crime. He actually called the sister of the
victim to say that his sister was afraid of Mr. Muncey
and that she had plans to leave him. When we look at
what was available to trial counsel there, we see five
witnesses, many of whom were friends of Mr. Muncey, who
presented evidence that showed that on the night of Ms.
Muncey's murder, Mr. Muncey and Ms. Muncey had a fight
at the C&C Recreation Center, that Ms. Muncey went
home, that Mr. Muncey followed her there, that he
confessed that when he returned home, he was angry and
drunk, that they began to argue again, that he struck
her in the head, that she fell, that he checked her
lifeless body and found she was dead, and that he hid
her body in the bushes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but the -- the
injuries on the body are simply not consonant with --
with that manner of her -- of her death. A police
officer testified not only to a head injury, but to
blood coming out of the nose and ears, scratches and
bruises on her throat and legs, scratches on her face.
That simply is not consonant with one whack on the
head.
MR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, there --
there are two issues there. In fact, the -- the
pathologist's testimony and -- and the law enforcement
officer's testimony is consistent to the extent that
the injuries which Mr. Muncey described inflicting
were, in fact, inflicted upon the victim. There were
those injuries. The point -- the fact that there were
additional injuries to the victims -- to the victim
assumes that somehow Mr. Muncey's independent, short
confession, because, remember, when he started to
confess -- after he makes this confession, he's rushed
out of the home and told that they don't want to hear
anything. This isn't a situation like a law
enforcement -- a confession made to law enforcement
where once obtaining evidence of guilt, law enforcement
pursues and tries to get as many of the details out of
it. I don't believe that it would be -- it's
significant or it would be significant to any
reasonable juror that Mr. Muncey did not describe every
single injury that he inflicted on Ms. Muncey that
night.
JUSTICE BREYER: You've mentioned -- in
response to Justice Ginsburg, you didn't mention -- and
perhaps it was inadvertent. If not, I want to know why
not. I thought if you get through the gate, what
you're going to say is the State should have given us
evidence that they had that showed that Mr. Muncey had
sexual relations with his wife the morning of the
killing, and therefore, the semen that they found
didn't necessarily belong to your client, but rather
belonged to him. As it turned out, it didn't.
MR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice
Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: So you're going to make that
Brady claim.
MR. KISSINGER: We -- we are going to also
make the Brady claim. In addition, Your Honor, if
indeed that evidence was available to trial counsel,
who did talk to Mr. Muncey, who was able to interview
Mr. Muncey, and failed to ask Mr. Muncey whether he had
had sexual relationships with his wife, even though
trial counsel attempted ineffectively at trial to -- to
show that -- that that semen belonged to Mr. Muncey.
So it's one of those situations, Justice Breyer, where
there is either Brady for the State's failure to turn
it over, or if it was available, it's another instance
of ineffective assistance of counsel.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, could I step
-- step back a little bit to get -- to get back to the
standard of review? Because I think it's an unusual
one. You started out by talking about what the first
jury knew and didn't know, but we are in no sense
reviewing that jury determination. Correct?
MR. KISSINGER: That is correct, Justice
Roberts.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are supposed to
look at all of the evidence, the new evidence and the
old evidence, and determine simply whether or not it
would be unreasonable for any juror to vote to convict
on the basis of all of that evidence. Is that right?
MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, what Schlup says
is that we are to step back and see whether it is more
likely than not that no -- that any reasonable juror
would vote to convict.
JUSTICE BREYER: Any reasonable juror would
have to have a reasonable doubt.
MR. KISSINGER: Would have -- would have --
that's correct, Justice Breyer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, in other words,
no reasonable juror -- no -- no juror could reasonably
vote to convict. In other words, if we look at this
evidence and think that -- and again, we're not
reviewing the prior jury's evidence. If we look at
this and say, maybe a jury would come out 10 to 2 in
favor of acquittal, if we think that would be
reasonable, then you lose. Right?
MR. KISSINGER: Chief Justice Roberts, I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under my hypothetical
there are two reasonable jurors who vote to convict.
MR. KISSINGER: Chief Justice Roberts, the
danger in that hypothetical is that we are approaching
an area where the definition of the reasonable juror
becomes something subjective. The definition of a
reasonable juror is not a subjective inquiry. In fact,
it's a -- it's an objective inquiry. So to that
extent, I would have to disagree with -- with your
analysis or your -- or your hypothetical, which is that
maybe there might be two jurors out there who would
listen to this evidence and vote to convict Mr. House.
I don't think that's a correct statement --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Schlup shouldn't --
shouldn't have expressed it that way then. Schlup must
have -- must have made a big mistake when it said no
reasonable juror could. It should have expressed it
differently and said a reasonable juror would not --
would not have found, but they didn't say that. It
said no reasonable juror.
MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, I believe the
Court in -- I believe the Court in Schlup took the word
reasonable to encompass the point which I have just
made.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, didn't -- you -- you
have accepted Justice Scalia's formulation, but my
understanding is that Schlup did not say no reasonable
juror could. Schlup said no reasonable juror would
have. Isn't that correct?
MR. KISSINGER: And that's correct, Justice
Souter.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But I mean, it's would, not
could.
MR. KISSINGER: It -- it is would.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Could would imply a
sufficiency of evidence possibility of analyzing it,
but the would language excludes a sufficiency of
evidence. The -- the would formulation says, in
effect, what would the reasonable juror actually have
done. Is that your understanding? I mean, is that
your point?
MR. KISSINGER: That is, Justice Souter.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Or more precisely, what
would all reasonable jurors have done.
MR. KISSINGER: What would any reasonable
juror, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: All reasonable jurors.
MR. KISSINGER: I believe the language is
any.
Well, if there are no more questions, I'd
like to reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Kissinger.
Ms. Smith, we'll hear now from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER SMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The evidence presented in the district court
fails to raise sufficient doubt about Mr. House's guilt
to justify review of his procedurally defaulted claims
because reasonable jurors would not ignore the fact
that Mr. House's jeans were stained with the blood of
Carolyn Muncey. That is a fact that has not been
undermined by any of the evidence presented in the
Federal habeas proceeding.
The enzymatic degradation theory of Dr. Blake
was so thoroughly discredited in the Federal
evidentiary hearing that it is highly unlikely that any
reasonable juror, viewing all the evidence, would be
convinced by it, let alone that everyone would vote to
acquit in light of it. In fact, the petitioner's
evidence of innocence was disputed in nearly every
respect and sorely --
JUSTICE BREYER: How was -- how was that? I
thought you'd go on to say how that -- how was it? I
-- I read that Dr. Blake said this. He said, look, I
-- there -- there are tiny little specks of blood on
the jeans and we test them. They were tested. And
they show that a certain enzyme deteriorated to degree
X, and that's true of the test tube blood as well.
Both deteriorated to degree X. But if you take fresh
blood and splatter it, there will be no deterioration.
So conclusion: the blood on the jeans came from the
test tube. Now, you say that was discredited, but I
didn't read anywhere anything that discredited it.
What was the discrediting of that?
MS. SMITH: That was specifically discredited
by the -- by the testimony of Agent Bigbee.
JUSTICE BREYER: Who said?
MS. SMITH: Dr. Blake's specific opinion was
that his interpretation of the enzyme marker study,
specifically the GLO1 enzyme on the jeans and on the
vial --
JUSTICE BREYER: Right.
MS. SMITH: -- showed inc -- inc --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MS. SMITH: -- which he took to mean
incomplete penetrance.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MS. SMITH: Agent Bigbee specifically
disputed not only the literal interpretation of that,
in that it doesn't mean incomplete penetrance. In
fact, Agent Bigbee did not know what that even meant in
the area of serology, but he -- he disagreed with the
meaning that Dr. Blake ascribed to that -- to that
definition -- to that notation.
JUSTICE BREYER: Which meant what?
MS. SMITH: Which Dr. Blake concluded that --
JUSTICE BREYER: Was incomplete, and what did
the FBI man say it was?
MS. SMITH: Agent Bigbee testified -- or Dr.
Blake testified that the inc meant that the enzyme was
not present, that it had dropped out.
JUSTICE BREYER: He -- he says it meant
incomplete. And what do you -- what did -- what did
Dr. Bigbee say it --
MS. SMITH: Dr. Blake said it was not
present. It had dropped out. Agent --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now -- I -- Dr. Blake, you
just said, said that the word inc meant incomplete.
MS. SMITH: That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: And you say Dr. Bigbee
discredited that by saying, no, it didn't mean that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's Agent Bigbee. I'm
getting confused.
JUSTICE BREYER: It meant something else.
What is the something else?
MS. SMITH: Agent Bigbee testified that inc
means --
JUSTICE BREYER: Means.
MS. SMITH: -- inconclusive --
JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Now, all right --
MS. SMITH: -- which means that the enzyme is
present --
JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, okay.
MS. SMITH: -- but that he could not subtype
JUSTICE BREYER: They don't know how much.
Now, I have on page 119, which they cite, of
the transcript Mr. Pruden is talking to Mr. -- Dr.
Blake. Would your opinion change, doctor, if the,
quote, inc notation meant inconclusive rather than
incomplete penetration? Answer: same difference.
Question: so your opinion would not change? Answer:
that is correct.
MS. SMITH: But the -- the dispute goes
beyond the literal interpretation of the inc. It goes
to the meaning ascribed to it. And Agent Bigbee
disagreed that Dr. Blake -- with Dr. Blake's conclusion
that the inc indicated that the enzyme had dropped out
of the sample. He said it was present. It could not
be typed.
Agent Bigbee also disagreed with Dr. Blake's
overarching theory that there was equal deterioration
in the vials -- in the blood in the vials and the
blood on the pants. In fact, Agent Bigbee went through
step by step --
JUSTICE BREYER: But it would have been the
easiest thing in the world for you if, in fact, you
think that this is not true that enzyme GL706BX,
contrary to what Dr. Blake said, had not deteriorated
in the blood spot, do a test. Find out if it's
deteriorated or not. Can't -- can't that be done?
I mean, Dr. Blake in this part is reading his
own report. His own report says the enzyme
deteriorated in the spots on the jeans, and I see
nothing here that says to the contrary. But if that
weren't true, the blood is right there, and if it
weren't true that it had deteriorated, I would have
expected testimony, at the least, saying no, Dr. Blake,
you are wrong.
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, that --
JUSTICE BREYER: The blood did not
deteriorate. The enzyme did not deteriorate. But
there is no such testimony. Instead, you seem to be
relying on the difference between the word incomplete
and inconclusive, a difference that Dr. Blake says is
inconclusive or incomplete.
MS. SMITH: Dr. Blake was not reading his own
report. Dr. Blake performed no independent analysis.
Dr. Blake was reading Agent Bigbee's report. Agent
Bigbee was explaining to the district court the meaning
of the notations that he included in his report.
But the -- but the dispute goes beyond just
experts.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So Bigbee -- Bigbee
was explaining what he meant when he wrote inc.
MS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it was different
than what Dr. Blake said it meant.
MS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor. The
report at issue was a report prepared pretrial by Agent
Bigbee when he did the -- the initial enzyme analysis.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The district court heard all
of this, didn't it, all this evidence, and -- and
didn't the district court make a factual finding?
MS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor. Not
only did the district court note --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we can call in
these witnesses ourselves, I suppose, and hear them all
again, but we usually accept the factual findings of
the trier of fact.
MS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor. And
the district court specifically found as a fact that
the blood spill --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But does that finding rest
on the conclusion that Dr. Blake was not credible and
Agent Bigbee was credible?
MS. SMITH: I think that that conclusion
implicitly includes a finding that Agent Bigbee was --
--
was credible and Dr. Blake was not credible.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And that Dr. Blake was not
credible.
MS. SMITH: There were additional --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And who -- what was Dr.
Blake's background?
MS. SMITH: Dr. Blake's background is -- is
that he was a forensic pathologist.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Employed often by the
State?
MS. SMITH: He was often employed by the
State. He had a history of -- of being employed by the
State. At this time, he was not a State agent, Your
Honor. He was not -- had not worked in any way, shape,
or form on this case. He did not perform the autopsy.
He did not view the body. He did not perform the
enzyme marker study in this case. He simply came in
and reviewed results and photographs that had been
conducted and taken by -- by individuals previously.
He had no direct responsibility in this case aside from
JUSTICE STEVENS: So you're -- you're
basically arguing he was not a credible witness.
MS. SMITH: He was not a credible witness,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is the answer
to my question? Because I do think it turns on this.
A lot does. The trial judge sat there and said this is
very important. Dr. Blake is quoting from something
called part 5, which I thought was his report. And
then the trial judge says, where did you get that idea?
Where did you get that idea, that the -- that the
enzyme wasn't there in -- in the jeans' blood? Where
did you get it? And he says I got it from the FBI
report, I think. He's not certain because he's
remembering his own conclusion. He isn't quite sure
where he got it from.
And now it turns out that the inc when they
-- it said inc, which he thought meant there isn't much
enzyme there. And then they say, well, maybe it meant
inconclusive. And he says, that wouldn't matter because
I guess I took it to mean that too would show there
wasn't much enzyme there. Both would come to the same
thing.
And now, if I'm sitting there and thinking,
I'm thinking, well, either there is or there isn't this
enzyme in the -- in the blood that's right there.
Easiest thing in the world to prove. And if somebody
is going to dispute it, the State will come back and
say, no, no, the enzyme is there. But they didn't.
So I read the testimony and I read the fact
that you didn't dispute it with any evidence that's
saying, yes, the enzyme is not there.
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, Agent Bigbee
specifically testified that the enzyme was there.
JUSTICE BREYER: He did? Where is that?
MS. SMITH: He specifically testified on page
2 of the joint appendix. He specifically said, that
doesn't mean it wasn't present. He also pointed out
GLO should have been present --
JUSTICE BREYER: Let's --
MS. SMITH: -- and said it wasn't.
JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't mean it isn't
present isn't quite the same thing, is it?
MS. SMITH: Agent Bigbee specifically
testified that the enzyme was present. It could not be
typed to any degree of certainty. So he simply called
it inconclusive but that it was present. If it had not
been present, he would have marked it N/A, meaning no
activity, which was also included in the report in a
separate location.
But I think it goes beyond --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Smith, would -- could
you focusing on this, what's called a finding, although
the district judge himself puts it under conclusions of
law, just -- the court concludes that the spillage
occurred after the FBI crime laboratory received and
tested the evidence. What is the basis, the specific
basis, for that conclusion, that it occurred after the
FBI tested the evidence?
MS. SMITH: The specific basis identified
explicitly in the opinion was that Special Agent Scott,
when he removed the -- the blue jeans from the hamper
in Donna Turner's trailer, saw what appeared to be
bloodstains on the jeans. That blood ultimately ended
up testing as -- as positive for blood and, in fact,
Carolyn Muncey's blood so that -- so that the stains
were observed when they were removed from the hamper.
He also noted that Agent Bigbee testified when he
received the blood at the -- the FBI laboratory, there
was no evidence of contamination.
Agent Bigbee testified to the FBI protocols
and said that if there had been any evidence of
contamination or spillage, the evidence would have been
returned without testing. So he looked specifically at
that.
He also looked and specifically pointed out a
significant -- the testimony of Paulette Sutton, who
indicated -- who was the blood spatter expert. She
indicated that some of the bloodstains were mixed with
mud, and to her that indicated that there had not been
some accidental spillage in -- in an evidence
container, that the mud and the blood would have --
were -- were combined to the extent that they would
have had to get on the jeans at or near the same time.
So those -- those things --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but then there was
also the evidence that was not disputed, that it was a
dry day and that there was no mud at all at the scene
of the crime.
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I'm not sure that the
evidence is undisputed that it was a dry day. If you
look at the autopsy report that's in -- that's in
evidence in -- in the trial record, it specifically
says that it was drizzling that day, that the
temperature was between 80 and 90 degrees and it was
drizzling. Mr. House showed up with blood all over his
jeans. He got the blood somewhere. I don't -- nothing
is -- I don't think it's entirely clear that -- that
the conditions were dry. His -- his jeans were clearly
muddy --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that was --
MS. SMITH: -- and it showed up.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that it was agreed that
there -- that the site where the body was found, that
that was dry, that that was dry ground. I thought
there was no dispute about that.
MS. SMITH: I'm not sure that -- that it's
clear where Mr. House got the mud on his jeans. He was
-- he traveled some distance from the site of the body
and -- and to his home. He could have gotten muddy en
route. I -- I can't explain how he got the blood on
his jeans. I know he showed up with muddy jeans. He
got mud on his jeans at some point, and those -- and
the mud and the blood were -- were intermingled. I'm
not sure that they got on there at the same time.
I'm also not sure that the mud that Paulette
Sutton saw was -- was created by a combination of mud
and water. It could have been perspiration. It could
have been any other type of -- of fluid. It could have
been blood creating the mud.
So it's -- that is -- that's very ambiguous,
and -- and I think that the fact -- the significance of
the testimony is that it -- it did not indicate an
accidental spillage after the fact of the blood onto
the jeans. And I think that was -- that was the point
that the district court took from that. He wasn't
trying to -- to recreate the exact sequence of events
in the crime. He was simply trying to pinpoint at what
point the blood spilled because there's no question the
blood spilled. The -- the photograph shows it spilled.
The photograph shows that the -- that the tops had
come off. But the -- the photograph also shows --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but isn't there also
evidence that the spillage in the Styrofoam container
seemed to be inadequate to account for all of the blood
that was missing from the vial?
MS. SMITH: I think there was testimony that
-- that the appearance of it seemed to be inadequate.
There was no specific quantification of the blood, and
-- and no one -- no one attempted to do that. It's not
clear whether some of the blood leaked out of the
container and maybe wasn't contained within it. There
were -- there were pieces of gauze that had blood
soaked in it. There was also a dispute about the size
of the vials.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's important
for this whole question. Quantity relates to chain of
custody.
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I think what's
important is the point of the spillage. If -- if the
blood spilled after it left the FBI lab -- and that was
a specific finding made by the district court, and that
finding is clearly supported by the record. What
happened to the blood, where it spilled after the fact
-- and we know that it did spill -- really is -- is
beside the point because --
JUSTICE BREYER: Another blood question
because I -- the -- you make a point of the -- the
sheriff having said, well, I -- I saw blood on the
jeans. So I looked at the pictures and the pictures
seem to have little tiny bits of blood, while a lot of
mud. So I came to the conclusion that no reasonable
person could think that that testimony really shows
that the -- that there was -- there was blood from the
-- from the victim on his jeans.
Now, am I right about that? You're going to
think I'm wrong, and I want to hear why.
MS. SMITH: Well, I do think you're wrong,
Your Honor, because I -- I think that if you look in
the record, there are at least four witnesses who
indicated that they saw the blood. One was Special
Agent Scott.
JUSTICE BREYER: How could you have? It's so
tiny.
MS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the -- the
photographs that you have are photographs that are
taken after portions of the jeans have been cut out and
sent for testing. You're not seeing everything that --
that the agent saw. Special Agent Scott saw what he
believed to be blood. He couldn't -- he didn't know it
was blood, but -- but he suspected it was blood. He
identified in -- in the habeas proceeding the areas
that he believed it to be blood, and it turned out to
be blood.
Jerry Morissey, who was the defense
serologist and -- and, incidentally, just to -- that
reminds me of -- of a comment made by my colleague in
his argument about defense counsel's deficiency in not
-- in not hiring a serological expert. He had a
serological expert. Jerry Morissey testified, was a
serologist, and testified that he received the jeans
after the FBI tested it. He was unable to duplicate
the result, but as part of his testimony, he said that
he observed some bloodstains, what he thought to be
bloodstains, around the FBI cuttings, and he attempted
to do additional testing on those bloodstains. So he
saw the stains.
Agent Bigbee testified that he observed the
stains. He didn't say that some were big or some were
small. He said that he observed them.
As well, Paulette Sutton in the Federal
habeas proceeding said that she saw the stains. She
said she couldn't tell upon observation that it was
blood, but it was dark and she suspected it was blood.
It was suspicious.
So we have at least four witnesses who say
they saw this blood. This wasn't microscopic. This
was something that -- that witnesses -- and
incidentally, Paulette Sutton's observation was borne
out because she did presumptive testing. So the things
that -- the spots that she suspected were blood in fact
turned out to be blood.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Smith, could -- could
you go on to some of the other elements that are
contested here? In particular, I'm interested in -- in
Mr. Muncey's confession. What -- what do you -- what
do you say about that?
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I -- I think of all
the evidence presented below, I think that the
confession evidence is -- is perhaps the least reliable
in terms of -- of the Schlup analysis.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What did the jury hear
about Muncey's confession?
MS. SMITH: The jury was never informed of
Muncey's confession because the --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I thought not.
MS. SMITH: -- the fact of Muncey's
confession didn't come up until 13-14 years after the
trial had already been concluded. And -- and that's
one of the things that the district court, in -- in
examining their testimony, found what was significant
in his --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But wasn't the district
court incorrect in that? Because as I understand it,
there was evidence from one of the two witnesses who
put in the confession evidence that she had gone to the
sheriff's department to -- to tell them about the
confession and had simply gotten a runaround and
finally left. So as I understand it, the -- the record
would not support the finding that -- that the -- the
sources of evidence simply kept silent for over a
decade.
MS. SMITH: Well, that's what the witness
testified to, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is there any reason
not -- did the -- did the district court explain that
it was rejecting that element of the witnesses'
testimonies?
MS. SMITH: The district court did not
specifically address that element of the witnesses'
testimony. The court found that it -- specifically
that it was not impressed with the testimony of a
witness who waits. And -- and this Court has said on
many occasions that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I know, but without getting
to that point, it sounds as though the district court
simply made a mistake, just forgot I suppose, the
evidence that the witness didn't wait at all.
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, regardless of whether
the witness waited or not, the Court examined the
credibility of the testimony and found that it wasn't
credible.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but one of the reasons
for the finding of -- of incredibility was the decade
or more of silence.
MS. SMITH: That was one of the reasons, but
the primary reason that the -- that the confession
itself was inconsistent with the other evidence, and
that was what the court specifically pointed to in his
opinion.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the -- tell -- help me
out here. As -- as has been explored earlier, the
confession referred to -- to some of the injuries on
the body, but not to all of them. Were there -- were
there other disparities between the confession and --
and the -- and other evidence?
MS. SMITH: There were several disparities,
Your Honor. The confession indicates that there was
apparently an extensive argument at home. The
testimony of the daughter both at trial and in the
habeas corpus proceeding was that there was no such
argument. She heard no argument. And the court,
incidentally, found her testimony to be very credible.
He observed her demeanor and -- and found her
testimony to be credible. So that's inconsistent.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, as far as that's
concerned, she did testify that there was a car out
there.
MS. SMITH: That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the rest of the story
doesn't -- doesn't put the defendant House at the time
of the crime in a car. He's walking.
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, the -- the testimony
at trial was ambiguous about the -- about the car. The
witness identified two separate incidents. She heard a
car and she heard someone inquire as to Mr. Muncey's
whereabouts, and then she also heard an individual come
and tell her -- her mother that her father had been in
a wreck down by the creek and heard her mother leave
sobbing. Those are two distinct incidences. And Lora
Muncey testified that she did not know whether she had
gone back to sleep. She never could identify or -- or
define the specific length of time between the two.
But logically those are two separate
incidences. It doesn't make sense for someone to come
and ask where Mr. Muncey is and then to say, well, he's
down by the creek. He just had a wreck. So it -- it
seems that just logically those are two separate
incidences, and there's nothing in the -- in the
testimony to indicate that -- that they're same.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they happened at the
same time, didn't they? The --
MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. The --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the child testified to
what she heard, and I thought she heard a car and
someone in a low voice, and then her mother left with
that someone.
MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. She heard a car
and someone inquire as to the whereabouts of her
father, and she heard her mother answer. And then
there was a period of time where she said she wasn't
sure whether she went back to sleep or not, and then
she heard a person with a low voice come in and inform
her mother that she -- that -- that her father, Hubert
Muncey, Jr., had been in a wreck down by the creek.
She heard her mother sob and leave with the individual
who had relayed that information. Those are two
distinct incidences.
But beyond that -- the -- the court,
incidentally, found her testimony to be very credible,
found that her testimony did not support this -- this
theory of some sort of confrontation in the house.
In addition, the court also heard the live
testimony of Hubert Muncey, Jr. himself, explaining his
whereabouts, explaining -- and actually denying ever
having made the statement. And -- and the court
balanced that.
As well, Dennis Wallace, who testified at the
evidentiary hearing -- he investigated a missing
person's report. He was in the home. He saw no
evidence of any sort of struggle in the home.
So all of these things balanced against this
-- this confession, which has absolutely no
corroborative support in the record, the court found
that the testimony simply wasn't credible.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it did have
corroboration. Wasn't there a -- a wound on the victim
that was consistent with -- with the confession?
MS. SMITH: There was a -- a wound to the
victim's left forehead.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Was that not consistent
with the confession?
MS. SMITH: The confession was that Mr.
Muncey hit her and she fell and hit her head.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You tell me yes or no. Was
it -- was it consistent with the confession?
MS. SMITH: It -- it could be consistent with
the confession. It was -- it was very sketchy. There
-- there was a dispute between the two pathologists in
the habeas as to whether or not that -- that wound
could have been sustained by -- by falling and hitting
her head on a table and actually could have created
the -- the damage in -- in the brain.
JUSTICE BREYER: So overall, if -- looking at
this -- and that's why I think the question about the
weight to give to the fact finding is important. You
think -- you have a theory under which he could have
done it, and it's certainly possible in my opinion.
But also you think, my goodness, if he did
it, going and this luring of the woman to the creek --
you know, there's nothing else in the record that
suggests he would plot in that way to do this.
Nothing. The husband is away at the time from the
dance. He could have done it. They are fighting.
They could have done it. And if the luring theory
correct, the motive was sexual, but the sexual physical
evidence is from the husband, not from him.
So the jury is brought into this on a theory
that there is a sexual attack and the one -- by the
defendant, and the one thing that seems disproved
pretty much is that. And now we have two experts, Dr.
Blake and Dr. Bigbee. And reading a page, which I
hadn't read thoroughly until you pointed it out, I'd
say they might disagree. They might disagree. And
it's just not conclusive.
So if you're sitting there, do you have to
have a reasonable doubt when there's such strong
evidence for both people? And -- and the part that's
bothering me -- I -- I see what that district judge
said on that one point, which he may have thought was
peripheral but it turns out to be quite important about
when the blood spilled. But if you look to the
underlying thing and I think, well, maybe you're right,
but maybe you're not right.
And so how do -- how do I -- how do I do
this? What's the -- what's the weighing? I sit there
and think, my goodness, I don't know who committed this
crime if I'd been on that jury. And could -- could a
person sitting there reasonably come to a conclusion,
my goodness, I know?
MS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think to
answer your question is if you are at that mental state
where you are saying maybe this evidence is right, maybe
that -- that evidence is right, maybe I can go one way
or another, then I think the respondent prevails in this
case --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but that -- that simply
says if the -- it seems to me you're simply saying there
would be sufficient evidence to go the one way rather
than the other. And -- and you may well be right about
that, but that certainly is not the reasonable doubt
standard.
MS. SMITH: I think it goes beyond just
having sufficient evidence to convict, Your Honor. I
think you also look at these credibility determinations
and you look at the probabilistic result of a
reasonable juror.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Justice Breyer has not heard
these witnesses and hasn't had the opportunity to know
whether -- whether, for example, these -- this
testimony about the confession was credible or not.
MS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And the hearer of -- at the
trial did have that opportunity.
MS. SMITH: The district court heard both of
the -- both of the sisters regarding the confession.
The district court heard Hubert Muncey, Jr. regarding
the alleged confession.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but may I interrupt
you? What -- what about -- I want to just follow up on
something that Justice Breyer alluded to and that is
the significance of the DNA evidence. And I have
tended to -- to think that a reasonable juror would
look at it this way, but if I'm wrong, I -- I want you
to comment on it.
One of the -- I -- I assume, to begin with,
that any reasonable juror would have found this
evidence, the evidence of the semen stains, extremely
significant because not only did the State argue rape
as a -- as a motive, possible motive, but there was a
specific finding of an aggravated circumstance that the
murder occurred in the course of kidnapping and rape.
I don't know of any evidence that would suggest an --
an independent kidnapping crime without the rape
element under, you know, the circumstances of -- of
this crime. So I'm -- I -- I assume that the
reasonable juror, having come to the conclusion that
that aggravating circumstance is true, found that a
rape was being committed.
If that juror had heard the DNA evidence,
that juror would have said the only positive evidence
that a rape was committed here would be evidence that
pointed to the husband, not in fact to -- to the
defendant House. And if -- if a juror had heard that
--
evidence, it seems to me it is highly unlikely that any
reasonable juror would have concluded that that
aggravating circumstance was found, and I suppose that
would play a -- a significant role in -- in the
ultimate conclusion.
Now, you have argued that the fact that the
DNA evidence shows that it was the husband's fluids,
not House's, doesn't conclusively prove that House
didn't rape her, and of course, you're right. But my
understanding is that there is no evidence from which
one would reasonably infer that House did this.
Now, what is -- what is your comment on that
MS. SMITH: My comment -- sorry.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- analysis?
MS. SMITH: My comment on the DNA evidence is
that the DNA evidence did nothing more than confirm
what the jury was -- already knew was very likely,
which was that the donor of the semen was the husband.
The jury at trial was informed that the husband -- and
it went through several pages. In the joint appendix,
it goes all the way from page 56 to 66 where we're
exploring that the semen could have been deposited by
the husband or by Mr. House.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there was a finding
--
that it was in the course of the rape.
MS. SMITH: There was --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was part of that.
That was -- that was one of the -- was it one of three
aggravating circumstances?
MS. SMITH: One of three, and -- and that was
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It was found at the guilt
phase or the trial phase, the aggravating circumstance?
MS. SMITH: It was at -- it was an
aggravating circumstance of sentencing, that -- that
the murder was perpetrated in the -- in the attempt --
in -- in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate
kidnapping or rape or attempted rape.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then at -- at a
minimum, it seems to me that the sentencing phase is --
is in question by that.
But also, it seems to me if I were a juror
and was faced with these conflicting things, I would
look for motive.
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, the motive is -- is
well supported by the circumstances. And in fact, if
you look at the prosecutor's argument --
JUSTICE SCALIA: There is evidence of rape
besides -- besides the semen. The semen wasn't the
only evidence of rape, was it?
MS. SMITH: No, sir, it wasn't.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There were scratches on the
thighs.
MS. SMITH: There was --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but the semen was
used to -- to connect it to the -- to the defendant,
and we now know that that's wrong.
MS. SMITH: The prosecutor argued at trial on
the motive question, why else would someone lure a
woman out of her home with a lie in the middle of the
night in her night clothes and take her out into the
woods, if not to have some sort of --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Who put in the evidence --
who put in the semen evidence?
MS. SMITH: The State put in the semen
evidence, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: They did that to prove
she had sex with her husband? Is that the reason?
(Laughter.)
MS. SMITH: The State put in the semen
evidence because it was -- it was not inconsistent with
Mr. House and that there was other evidence in the
record that was not -- all of the -- all this -- this
physical evidence was consistent with Mr. House, just
--
as the semen was.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to
this -- the standard of review question? Because it
goes directly to this point. Even if you think that
the argument based on the semen is not harmless error,
in other words, that the prior jury may well have
convicted based on that, we're not reviewing that
jury's determination. Correct?
MS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.
You're looking at how -- how a reasonable juror would
view the case if it knew --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we should be
looking at the case with the semen evidence showing
what we know it to show, regardless of whether we think
the prior jury was misled by the admission of that
evidence.
MS. SMITH: That's absolutely correct, Your
Honor. If -- if the -- if a reasonable jury knew that
the semen belonged to Mr. -- belonged to Mr. Muncey and
not Mr. House, the result would be exactly the same
because Carolyn Muncey's blood was all over Mr. House's
pants. That is an indisputable fact. And all of this
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about at the
sentencing stage? Justice Kennedy brought it up. The
-- the prosecutor didn't emphasize unduly the semen at
the -- at the guilt stage but, boy, made a big deal out
of it at the sentencing stage.
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I disagree that --
that they made a big deal. They made a big deal of
the kidnapping at the sentencing phase. That was --
that was of significance. The -- what the prosecutor
did --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where was it in the -- in
the joint appendix? I thought it was more than
kidnapping.
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, the -- the sentencing
phase argument is not contained in -- in the joint
appendix. The closing argument from the guilt phase is
contained in -- in the joint appendix, but it's
certainly in the -- in the transcripts before the
Court.
What -- what the prosecutor focused on at
sentencing was -- was the kidnapping and also was the
malice and -- and I'm sorry -- the -- specifically the
kidnapping --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Said nothing about the
semen --
MS. SMITH: The --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- at the -- at the
sentencing stage?
MS. SMITH: At the sentencing phase, the
prosecutor said that the evidence would have been
consistent with sexual molestation, I think was the
word that he used.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Smith.
MS. SMITH: Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kissinger, you
have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. KISSINGER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KISSINGER: Very quickly. Dr. Blake's
testimony was not, in fact, discredited. Counsel for
respondent says that -- places great significance on --
on Dr. Blake's interpretation of the initials inc as
standing for incomplete penetration, and that --
correctly that should have been construed as
inconclusive. Counsel fails to acknowledge the record
-- record 4 of the district court, volume 6, page 906.
Agent Bigbee himself uses the term inc to mean -- or
incomplete, just as Dr. Blake did. So in addition to
Dr. Blake saying, yes, I meant the same thing as
Justice Breyer observed, Justice Bigbee himself uses
the term inc to mean incomplete.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Page 282 of the joint
appendix, he says inconclusive is what the inc stands
for. Dr. Blake testified it is incomplete penetration,
which I haven't the foggiest idea what that means.
MR. KISSINGER: And that's correct, Your
Honor. In trial, he used -- he said that inc stands
for incomplete, and then Agent Bigbee at trial
proceeded to use incomplete and inconclusive
interchangeably just as Dr. Blake did.
In addition, when -- concerning Dr. Blake's
testimony, we have to remember that we still have the
missing tube of blood, and the blood on the jeans is
more consistent with blood coming from the degraded
blood sample than it is from blood which came -- got on
the jeans during the time of the offense.
The other thing, which I think is an
important matter to -- to keep in -- keep in mind
regarding Dr. Blake's testimony and Dr. Bigbee's, is
that Dr. Blake and Agent Bigbee both agree on the basic
science that blood enzymes deteriorate according the
various environmental factors and that as they
deteriorate, they become less detectable.
In terms of the -- the implicit credibility
findings, which respondent relies upon, the district
court during its opinion demonstrated that it know --
it knew how to make credibility findings. In fact, it
made two specific credibility findings in this case
when it found Mr. House's testimony to be incredible
and the testimony of Lora Muncey to be credible.
As far as the -- the suggestion that, yes,
there was -- the crime scene was wet, that that -- that
there was water at -- or there's a possibility of mud
at the crime scene, not only is this contradicted by
the absence of the mud -- of mud on the victim's
clothing, but also the drizzling which counsel
described occurred on the day following the murder, not
before it happened, not at the time the murder was
occurring, but on the day following the murder. So, in
fact, there was -- the murder scene was dry, just as
petitioner has informed the Court.
As far as the daughter not hearing any sign
of a struggle, the daughter's testimony was that she
did not hear any sign of a struggle when she got up
immediately after her mother left the home. The
testimony at the evidentiary hearing, unrebutted and
unimpeached, was that at that point in time when she
was hearing nothing, her mother was, in fact, at the
C&C Recreation Center involved in a fight with Hubert
Muncey, Jr. In fact, that testimony goes to Mr.
House's innocence because at the time she hears
nothing, she hears no sign of a struggle, is the very
time that the State of Tennessee contended that Mr.
House was out murdering Carolyn Muncey, and yet the
daughter who was outside of the home within 50 yards of
where this murder occurred heard absolutely nothing.
Justice Scalia asked was there, in fact,
other evidence of -- of rape. Wasn't there, in fact,
bruises found on her thighs? On cross examination, the
pathologist testified, admitted on cross examination,
that the scratches on Ms. Muncey's thighs were more
likely attributable to her being dragged through the
brush and her body being hidden which, incidentally, is
an act which Mr. Muncey confessed to doing.
In addition, as I stated before, the evidence
has to be viewed in light of the entirety of the
evidence of the record. It isn't just the blood
evidence. It isn't just the semen evidence. It isn't
even just the confession. It's also the fact that the
same witness who puts Mr. Muncey -- or who puts Mr.
House even leaving the Donna Turner home on the night
of the murder puts Mr. House leaving the home at a --
thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
