CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear
argument next this morning in case 11-796,
Bowman v. Monsanto Company.
Mr. Walters.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK P. WALTERS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALTERS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court:
Patent exhaustion provides that once a
patented article is sold, it passes outside the
protection of the Patent Act, and it is available to be
used by the purchaser to practice the invention.
Now, what's the invention here? The
invention is a bit of DNA that, when inserted into a soy
bean seed, makes that seed and all the plants that grow
from that seed resistant to the active ingredient in
Roundup. Now, the only way to practice that invention
is to plant the seed and to grow more seeds.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why in the world
would anybody spend any money to try to improve the seed
if as soon as they sold the first one anybody could grow
more and have as many of those seeds as they want?
MR. WALTERS: I agree no one would do that,
and I don't think that is the situation here. I think
we have, and we have explained how Respondents here can
protect their invention through contracts. They don't
have to sell it outright. They can sell it through an
agency model, but the more I think important --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's true, that's
true in the case of any patented article, right?
MR. WALTERS: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the patent system
is based, I think, on a recognition that contractual
protection is inadequate to encourage invention.
MR. WALTERS: Well, part of the patent
policy, as well, is to protect the purchaser, and that's
been part of this Court's law for more than 150 years.
Under Respondent's theory, any farmer who
grows a soy bean seed is infringing the patent, but for
the grace of Monsanto. And that's -- a lot of farmers
in this country, when we have over 90 percent of the
acreage that is Roundup Ready. So under Monsanto's
theory, there is really no limit by the Exhaustion
Doctrine?
JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand that
last sentence. Any farmer who plants and grows soybeans
is violating the patent?
MR. WALTERS: Is infringing under license by
Monsanto. Let's take the first --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that their claim
is that he only violates the patent if he tries to grow
additional seeds from his first crop. Right? Isn't
that the only claim here?
MR. WALTERS: The reach of Monsanto's theory
is that once that seed is sold, even though title has
passed to the farmer, and the farmer assumes all risks
associated with farming, that they can still control the
ownership of that seed, control how that seed is used.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, not that seed. It's
different seed. That seed is done. It's been planted
in the ground and has grown other seed. It's the other
seed we are talking about. It's not the very seed that
was sold. Right?
MR. WALTERS: That's correct, Your Honor,
but if we don't apply -- if exhaustion is eliminated,
rather, for the progeny seed, then you are taking away
the ability of people to exchange these goods freely in
commerce. You have essentially a servitude on these
things that are exchanged, and every grain elevator who
makes a sale is infringing.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think you may be
right in the way you characterize Monsanto's argument,
and I have great difficulties with characterizing it
that way, as Justice Scalia's question indicates. But
Monsanto can still prevail if you say that there's a
patent infringement, if he plants it for seed and uses
the seed to replant. That's not as far as Monsanto
goes, but it seems to me it's one way to characterize
their argument and to make it sensible.
MR. WALTERS: If you assume that there is
exhaustion in the seeds that are sold to the farmer --
let's take our particular case here. Mr. Bowman went to
a grain elevator and he bought from the grain elevator
without restriction seeds to – and it was his purpose to
plant them. Now, the only way that he can make use –-
if you assume in the first instance that there is
exhaustion to the seeds that Mr. Bowman purchased from
the grain elevator, you are taking away any ability for
him to use that seed or use the invention.
Let's take for example Claim 130, which is
at the supplemental appendix 19, that is a method for
selectively controlling weeds in a field. It has two
elements; the first element is planting the crop seed
and it's a particular crop seed with all the particular
genetics that encode for resistance to Roundup, and then
the next step is to apply to the crop and weeds in the
field a sufficient amount of glyphosate herbicide.
Now, if you say that there is exhaustion in
the seeds that Mr. Bowman purchased from the grain
elevator, but you say it doesn't apply to the progeny,
you are not allowing him to actually practice the
invention to grow more seeds.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, but you are allowing
him to use those seeds for anything else he wants to do.
It has nothing to do with those seeds.
There are three generations of seeds. Maybe
three generations of seeds is enough.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: It is for this example.
First of you have the Monsanto, the first generation
they sold. They have children, which is the second
generation. And those children have children, which is
the third generation, okay? So bad joke.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: So we are talking here --
he can do what he wants with the first generation.
Anything he wants. And moreover, when he buys them from
Monsanto, he can make new seeds. He can make generation
2 because they've licensed him to do it.
Here, he buys generation 2. Now, he can do
what he wants with those seeds. But I'll tell you,
there is a problem because the coming about of the third
generation is itself the infringement. So the second
generation seeds have nothing to do with it. If he went
into a room and had a box that he bought from a lab and
he put rocks in it and he said, hocus-pocus and lo and
behold out came the third generation of seeds, he would
have infringed Monsanto's patent with that third
generation, would he not?
MR. WALTERS: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, he wouldn't have? You
mean if he goes and finds a new way of making these
seeds, which happens to do with you pick some grass and
you intertwine it and various things like that, and lo
and behold you have a perfect copy of Monsanto's patented
seed, he hasn't made it, he hasn't infringed? Why not?
MR. WALTERS: Well, I guess I misunderstood
your question.
JUSTICE BREYER: My question is the same
with the grass as with the magic box. I am saying the
problem for you here, I think, is that, infringement
lies in the fact that he made generation three. It has
nothing to do with generation 2. That has just a
coincidence. But that is, in fact, the way he made
these seeds. But he can sell, resell generation 2, he
can do whatever he wants with it.
If he sterilizes it and uses them in a
circus, he can do it. The only thing he cannot do is he
cannot create generation 3, just as he couldn't use
generation 2 seeds to rob a bank.
You know, there are certain things that the
law prohibits. What it prohibits here is making a copy
of the patented invention. And that is what he did. So
it's generation 3 that concerns us. And that's the end
of it.
Now, what is your response to that?
MR. WALTERS: Justice Breyer, my response
is, if you applied the law that way to side making over
use, you are eliminating the Exhaustion Doctrine in the
context of -- of patented seeds. You're saying that he
can do --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why --
MR. WALTERS: -- anything but practice the
invention.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- you said
making or use and it isn't an either-or thing then -- as
the other side has pointed out. You can use the seed to
make new seeds. So use and make aren't -- it's not
either you use it or you make it. You can use it to
make a new item.
MR. WALTERS: Justice Ginsburg, that is the
point of the invention here. If you look at claim 130
again, for example, you are saying he can't practice
claim 130, which is certainly embodied in the seeds he
purchased from the grain elevator.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose he -- he
had never bought any Monsanto seeds. He just goes to
the grain elevator and 90-odd percent of those seeds
have the genetic composition. So -- and he planted that
and he harvested it. Would he be infringing on
Monsanto's patents?
MR. WALTERS: No.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So he never has to buy
any seed, at all, from Monsanto.
MR. WALTERS: Well, in practical matters it
doesn't work that way because the seed that's available
at a grain elevator is not a very good source of seed
and farmers are not going to be able to eliminate the
need to go to Monsanto or the other seed companies every
year by going to the grain elevator.
Great evidence of that is the fact that my
client, every year that he planted a second crop using
the grain elevator seed, he bought high quality seed
from Pioneer. Now, if this grain elevator -- grain
elevator seed was so good, why didn't he use it for his
first crop?
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm still not getting the
answer. I'm going to try once more. Now, when you buy
generation 2, well, there are a lot of things you can do
with it. You can feed it to animals, you can feed it to
your family, make tofu turkeys. I mean, you know, there
are a lot of things you can do with it, alright.
But I'll give you two that you can't do.
One, you can't pick up those seeds that you've just
bought and throw them in a child's face. You can't do
that because there's a law that says you can't do it.
Now, there's another law that says you
cannot make copies of a patented invention. And that
law you have violated when you use it to make generation
3, just as you have violated the law against assault
were you to use it to commit an assault.
Now, I think that's what the Federal Circuit
is trying to get at. And so it really has nothing to do
with the Exhaustion Doctrine. It has to do with some
other doctrine, perhaps, that -- that somehow you think
should give you the right to use something that has as a
basic purpose making a copy of itself. Maybe you
should, but I don't see that. Where is that in the law?
MR. WALTERS: Your Honor, that's an
exception to the Exhaustion Doctrine for
self-replicating inventions.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. WALTERS: The invention here is --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that there? Is that --
is that there in the Exhaustion Doctrine?
MR. WALTERS: It is not there. This -- this
Court has -- has not created an exception to the
Exhaustion Doctrine, and in fact it's explicitly said it
won't do that and that's an act -- and that's an
activity for Congress.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. The
Exhaustion Doctrine permits you to use the good that you
buy. It never permits you to make another item from
that item you bought. So that's what I think
Justice Breyer is saying, which is you can use the seed,
you can plant it, but what you can't do is use its
progeny unless you are licensed to because its progeny
is a new item.
MR. WALTERS: This is obviously a brand-new
case where we're dealing with the -- the doctrine of
patent exhaustion in the context of self-replicating
technologies. So what you have here is if you take the
Federal Circuit's view, then you have no ability -- you
have no exhaustion at all for someone to practice the
invention. Sure, you can do all the things that you
talked about, Mr. Breyer -- or Justice Breyer, but that
has nothing to do with the -- or with the invention.
So you're taking the Exhaustion Doctrine for
self-replicating inventions, you're modifying this
Court's case law substantially, and that's something
that ought to be done in Congress. In fact --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you just said
that -- that we haven't had a case involving
self-replicating. I mean, the Exhaustion Doctrine was
shaped with the idea of an article; there was an article
that you could use and then you use it and it's used up.
But we haven't applied the Exhaustion Doctrine when you
have a new -- when you create a copy of the original.
So it's -- it's not that we have law in
place. We've been dealing with an item with the
Exhaustion Doctrine and now we have hundreds of items,
thousands of items, all growing from that original seed.
MR. WALTERS: The Exhaustion Doctrine, the
policy that underlies this Court's cases is
fundamentally a choice about the purchaser's rights in
that personal property over the patentee's rights in the
monopoly to use that monopoly and increase its sales.
This Court has always chosen the purchaser's rights over
the patentee's rights to increase sales. And we're just
asking you to make the same choice here.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, except to the extent,
as Justice Breyer suggested, except to the extent that
the purchase is going to use the article just to create
a new one of the exact same kind.  And it seems to me
that what you're suggesting is that the basic rule that
says that the purchaser does not get to do that should
have an exception for self-replicating technologies.
MR. WALTERS: First, we disagree that the
activity of basic farming could be considered making the
invention. If you read the statute, it says making the
invention, not just making a copy like it would be in
the Copyright Act. We have the invention, which is a
particular genetic sequence that was made, principally,
by Monsanto's genetic engineers. And farmers, when they
plant seeds, they don't exercise any control or dominion
over -- over their crop. Otherwise, every year they'd
have a bumper crop.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you mean they don't
do any work, they don't lay the soil and the nutrients
it needs, water when it needs watering, protect it from
animals? They do no work --
MR. WALTERS: They absolutely --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in growing the seed?
MR. WALTERS: They absolutely do work, but
they don't have control over the creative process. They
plant, they spray and they pray.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sure if they don't
do all of the things I said, it doesn't grow. So aren't
they involved in its creative -- in its creation?
MR. WALTERS: They certainly aren't in
control of it. You ask any farmer who's lived through a
drought or through a terrible flood and they will say
they're not the ones who are making these --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you only need
one -- I mean, you throw the seeds on the ground, one or
two of them are going to grow and you still have the
same case, right?
MR. WALTERS: Absolutely. And -- and that's
how broad this position is. It doesn't matter how you
come into possession with these seeds. You are
committing patent infringement if you -- any cell
division is patent infringement.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but that's
what I thought you were going to respond. I thought you
were going to respond to me that my question then makes
it infringement when your client buys generation 1 from
Monsanto because they buy generation 1 from Monsanto,
they plant it in the ground and lo and behold up comes
generation 2. And generation 2, on the basis of what I
was asking you, is just as much a violation.
But I think, though I'll find out from them,
that the response of that is, yes, you're right, it is
just as much of a violation. That's why we, Monsanto,
give the buyer a license to do it.
And so it all seems to work out. You don't
need any exception. There's no exception from anything.
When you create a new generation, you have made a
patented item, which you cannot do without the approval
of the patent owner. Therefore, Monsanto gives that
approval when you buy generation 1.
Now, it seems to me all to work out without
any need for exception. And I'm putting to you my whole
thought so that you can respond to it.
MR. WALTERS: Thank you, Justice Breyer.
What Monsanto wants to do in your scenario is they want
the farmer to assume all the risks of farming. They
want -- but they still want to control and act as owners
of the property that is owned, no doubt, by that farmer.
When that farmer grows the progeny seed, that they
insure the risk that they're not going to have a crop in
the first place. If they drive to the grain dealer to
sell their harvest -- they get one paycheck a year, by
the way -- they, if they get into a wreck, that's not
Monsanto's problem; that's the farmer's problem.
So what they're essentially asking for is
for the farmers to bear all the risks of farming, yet
they can sit back and control how that property is used.
And that's fundamentally inconsistent with how this
Court has interpreted the Exhaustion Doctrine. The
thing that's very important is this is not a license,
this is an outright sale to the farmers of the first
generation.
And then they are -- they plant those seeds
because they have, under the Exhaustion Doctrine, a
right to use the invention, and then those progeny seeds
are owned outright by every farmer, and they assume all
risk of loss. So if -- if -- Monsanto wants to
control --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And they may -- they may
they own them, but that doesn't mean that they are
infringing. They may -- the seeds are owned by the
farmer. But when he uses them to grow more seeds, he's
infringing on that patent. So I don't think that the
ownership has anything to do with it.
MR. WALTERS: It's the servitude on the
title. And those things get sold to the grain
elevators, and now every time the grain elevator makes a
sale, it's technically infringing. And -- and that's
something that our law has never allowed for centuries.
And one of the main problems is that you have farmers,
their main livelihood here is to sell the seeds that
they grow. Now, if they don't have clear title and if
they don't have the ability to sell the property that
they -- that they grow, then that impinges upon their
ability to make a living.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have only one question
so far, it's a farming question. With some crops if
you are going to make seeds, you leave the crop in
longer. In -- what about soybeans? If the farmer has
the north 40 and the south 40, the north 40, he's going
to plants soybeans to be used for flour, human
consumption, and south 40, he wants seeds. Does he
leave the plants in the ground the same amount of time?
MR. WALTERS: You know, most farmers are not
growing soybeans for -- for seed. There are various
types of --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You would not? Okay.
MR. WALTERS: -- various types of farmers
who are -- who are growing foundation seed, for example,
that is very close to the -- to the first generation
seed that's engineered.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand this. I
thought soybeans are seeds.
MR. WALTERS: They are.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's -- if you're
going to use the soybeans for seeds as opposed to flour,
do you leave them in the ground any longer?
MR. WALTERS: I don't know the answer to
that question.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Walters, could you go
back to the Chief Justice's opening question because the
Chief Justice asked you what incentive Monsanto would
have to produce this kind of product if you were right.
And you said, well, they can protect themselves by
contract.
Actually, it seems to me that that answer is
peculiarly insufficient in this kind of a case because
all that has to happen is that one seed escapes the web
of these contracts, and that seed because it can
self-replicate in the way that it can, essentially makes
all the contracts worthless. So again, we are back to
the Chief Justice's problem, that Monsanto would have no
incentive to create a product like this one.
MR. WALTERS: Taking our example here
where -- where Petitioner bought commodity seeds, it's
an undifferentiated mixture, it can't be overemphasized
how different every single seed is, you don't know a
Monsanto from a Pioneer from an Asgrow. You don't know
the maturity rate. If I am a farmer, I need a
particular maturity bean for my field because I don't
want it to mature before it gets high enough for the
combine to come around and cut it.
So you want to be able to have -- you have
all these things dialed in, these different
variabilities. So if you go to the grain elevator and
you don't know what exactly it is that you want and you
just get a mixture, that's not going to be real --
competitive at all to Monsanto's first generation seed.
Now, the possibility of somebody selecting
one and saying, ah, that's the exact one that I need for
my field, I'm going to cultivate that and let it grow
into enough seeds so I can plant my first crop, that
would take a number of years to grow a 1,000-acre farm,
and it's not -- and by that time, farmers -- the nature
would have changed and evolved where you would want the
latest in disease resistance by that point.
So there are --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Please correct me if I am
wrong. I thought that's exactly what Bowman did here.
He went to a grain elevator and he -- he used the seeds,
and -- and he didn't know exactly the percentage mix,
but he used them.
MR. WALTERS: Well, he --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So he did exactly what you
said is uneconomical.
MR. WALTERS: No. Actually, he did
something quite different. He didn't select a
particular variety. He selected for the particular
trait, Roundup Ready, but there are probably more than a
dozen different ways in which the seed can vary --
disease resistance, maturity rates. And if you are a
farm --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, maybe I
didn't read this right. I thought what he did was plant
all the commodity seeds, and then applied the Roundup,
so that all that was left was the Roundup resistance
seeds, and then he used those.
MR. WALTERS: That's correct. But if you
look at a field that you plant with grain elevator
seed, it's going to be all different color because
they're going to be all different variety, they're all
going to mature at a different rate. So that if -- when
it comes harvest time, some of them are going to be too
close to the ground so that your combine's going to
miss --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Including the Monsanto
seeds?
MR. WALTERS: Including the Monsanto seeds.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Some of them would -- would
grow at different rates than others.
MR. WALTERS: Absolutely.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How come that's not
a problem the first time you plant?
MR. WALTERS: It's a problem each time.
This is a very poor choice -- choice of seed, but it
only makes sense to plant in a risky situation, like
when a farmer has been washed out from a flood, for
example, and it's late in the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I mean the
very first time, you get nothing but Monsanto Ready --
Roundup Ready seeds and you plant those. Are you
telling us you have the same problem with them growing
at different rates and all that?
MR. WALTERS: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that doesn't make
the commodity seeds any different?
MR. WALTERS: I'm sorry. I must have
misunderstood your question. The commodity seeds,
with -- the Roundup Ready commodity seeds will all grow
at different rates and have different disease
resistance, different maturity rates.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But not the original batch
that he buys from Monsanto?
MR. WALTERS: Correct. So --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The original batch that he
buys from Monsanto, in addition to being resistant to
the chemical that kills the weeds, in addition to that,
they all mature at the same rate.
MR. WALTERS: Exactly. They're of a uniform
variety. They are exactly what a farmer needs for
their --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So all the Monsanto seeds
are not -- are not fungible.
MR. WALTERS: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There are some of them that
mature early, some mature late.
MR. WALTERS: It makes sense. I mean, they
allow these seeds to be dumped into the common grain
elevator. They don't put any restrictions on what the
elevator does with it. There were no restrictions on my
client when he purchased them from the grain elevator.
So it's less of a problem for Monsanto for
people going to the grain elevator to plant.
Nevertheless, it's -- it's an outright sale, an
exhaustion applies to that particular sale, and permits
that farmer to use it. It's never going to be a threat
to Monsanto's business -- people planting grain elevator
seed.
Now, to answer your question, Justice Kagan,
about -- well, under our theory, if somebody does breach
a contract with Monsanto, they don't have to do it under
contract law, they can actually do it under an agency
model, like General Electric did in the 1920s. And then
that's only fair because there, the agent growers are
assuming -- well, Monsanto was assuming the risk that
the farmers are.
And there is some equitability there with
the -- the risk sharing between the farmers and
Monsanto. Now they want the farmers to take all the
risks associated with farming, yet they want to control
how they use those seeds all the way down the
distribution chain.
I will reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Sherry?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
I'd like to start by talking about this
Court's decision in J.E.M. because I think it largely
resolves this case. J.E.M. was a patent case, and the
issue there was whether or not you could get a utility
patent on a plant. The argument was that you couldn't
get a utility patent because the Plant Variety
Protection Act implicitly repealed the Patent Act in
that respect.
This Court rejected that argument, and the
reason it rejected that argument was because it found no
conflict between the two statutes. The reason it found
no conflict between the two statutes is because it said
that it is harder to get a utility patent, and for that
reason, you get greater protections -- under the Patent
Act, you get greater rights of exclusion under the
Patent Act than you do under the PVPA.
And it said, most notably, there is no seed
saving exemption in the Patent Act, there is no research
exemption in the Patent Act. The consequence of
Petitioner's argument would be that this Court would not
only be reading a seed-saving exemption into the Patent
Act, and a research exemption, it would be doing much,
much, much more under the guise of patent exhaustion.
Justice Breyer, as you pointed out, the
Exhaustion Doctrine really has nothing to do with this
case, and that's because the Exhaustion Doctrine has
always been limited to the particular article that was
sold, and we are talking about a different article here.
And it's never extended to the making of a new article.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean,
this -- the reason it's never is because this is an
entirely different case. It's the reason it's here
because you have the intersection of the Exhaustion
Doctrine and the -- the normal protection of reinvented
articles. So I don't think it gets you very far to say
that we've never applied the Exhaustion Doctrine that
way either. We have never applied the Reinvention
Doctrine to articles that reinvent themselves like plant
seed.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: It's true that the Court
hasn't had an exhaustion case specifically involving the
sort of replicating technology, but when the Court has
talked about exhaustion it has always focused on the
specific article that's sold and it has done that for a
reason. The concept underlying exhaustion is that when
the patentholder controls that very first sale it gets
the one royalty with respect to the actual article sold.
Petitioner's argument isn't limited to the
commodity grain that we are talking about. It's not
even limited -- when you talk -- Justice Breyer, you
mentioned the three different generations of seeds.
There is actually quite a few more generations than
those three.
If the concept is the sale of a parent plant
exhausts the patentholder's rights, not only with
respect to that seed, but with respect to all the
progeny seed, we would have to go all the way back to
the very first Roundup Ready plant that was created as
part of the transformation event. Every single Roundup
Ready seed in existence today is the progeny of that one
parent plant and, as Your Honor pointed out, that would
eviscerate patent protections. There would be no
incentive to invest, not just in Roundup Ready soybeans
or not even agricultural technology, but it's quite a
bit broader than that.
In order to encourage investment, the Patent
Act provides 20 years of exclusivity. This would be
reducing the 20-year term to essentially one and only
sale. It would be near impossible to recoup your
investments with that first sale and so the more likely
consequence is that research dollars would be put
elsewhere.
The other --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a pretty horrible
result, but let me give you another horrible result, and
that is if -- if we agree with you, farmers will not be
able to do a second planting by simply getting the
undifferentiated seeds from -- from a grain elevator
because at least a few of those seeds will always be
patented seeds, and no farmer could ever plant anything
from a grain elevator, which means -- I gather they use
it for second plantings where the risks are so high that
it doesn't pay to buy expensive seed. Now they can't do
that anymore because there's practically no grain
elevator that doesn't have at least one patented seed in
it.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: And the answer to that is
this is actually not a traditional farming practice.
Despite what Petitioner says, farmers do not generally
go to grain elevators, buy commingled grain, plant it in
the ground as seed. If you look at the American Soybean
Association brief submitted on behalf of soybean
farmers, it says as much. If you look at the CHS brief,
which is submitted on behalf of grain elevators, it also
explains that.
And there is a number of reasons why that is
the case. They’re the reasons that Petitioner talked
about, which is that they are an undifferentiated mix,
but there are other reasons as well. The business of
grain elevators is not to sell commingled grain as seed.
If that was their business they would have to comply with
seed labeling laws. They do not do so because it's not
their business model.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's why it's so cheap.
And that's why farmers --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that's why farmers
want to use it, for a cheap planting.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: But farmers wouldn't be
able to use it for another reason as well. Even if you
take patent law and you put it entirely to the side,
there is still the Plant Variety Protection Act.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But correct me -- correct
me if I am wrong; I thought that is what Bowman did.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Bowman did, absolutely
did it in this circumstance. But Bowman also said that
he is not aware of other farmers who are engaging in
this practice.
And again, there is another reason. Putting
aside the labeling laws, there is the Plant Variety
Protection Act and, as Pioneer points out in their
amicus brief, it is quite likely that a large amount of
the commingled grain is not only protected by patent,
but is actually protected by a Plant Variety Protection
Certificate, and what Petitioner did here would infringe
the Plant Variety Protection Certificate. So even
putting patent law to the side, this is not an
economically viable source of seed for farmers,
regardless.
And Petitioner's argument again isn't
limited to the grain elevators. It would apply to
saving your own seed and planting it generation after
generation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, sure, I understand.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: It would apply to selling
seeds to your neighboring farmer, and it would allow
seed companies to essentially compete with Monsanto upon
the first sale.
Now to the extent --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when -- when are
the patent rights exhausted in the seed?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: The patent rights are
exhausted in the seed at the same time they are
exhausted with respect to any other product, upon an
authorized sale. And so, Justice Breyer, again you had
it right when you were saying that you can do what you
want. In our view, once there is an authorized sale,
you can do what you want with respect to the seed that
you've actually purchased. That is the tangible article
that you paid for.
But you do need permission from the
patentholder in order to make a new generation of seed.
If -- to the extent, you know, any middle ground is
warranted, with all due respect, we would point to
Congress as the appropriate body. This Court said --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so I can follow
your -- just so I can follow your answer, Monsanto sells
the seed to the farmer. And you are saying if the
farmer grows the seed, he can sell it to anybody he
wants, right?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: If Monsanto authorizes --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm putting aside
all the contracts and stuff.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Right. So if Monsanto
authorized that first sale and authorized the planting,
they would also have to authorize the sale of the second
generation seed because it's a new article. And that's
exactly what happened here.
If you look at the technology agreement --
and it's not just because it's a contract because I
think it's significant to the analysis -- Monsanto, upon
the first sale of the bag of Roundup Ready seed,
authorizes the planting for one commercial crop and it
authorizes the farmer to sell that as a commercial crop
or to use it for any purpose other than replanting.
That is an authorized sale. So if you take
that second generation seed -- "second generation" is a
bit of a misnomer, but if you take that seed and you
follow it through, all of the patent rights with respect
to that particular seed have been exhausted. But you
cannot take that seed without separate authorization,
plant it in the ground, and come up with the next
generation of seed. That would be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That sounds like the
patent rights haven't been exhausted then.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: They have been exhausted
with respect to the particular article sold. When the
Court's talked about patent exhaustion, you are not
exhausting the rights with respect to the patented
invention. You're exhausting --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean it’s been
exhausted with respect to the one bean?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Yes, and that's always
the case just as if I sell -- I mean, even if you think
in the copyright --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's always the
case because it's a very -- the other cases haven't
involved the -- this situation where you are talking
about a self-regenerating product.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: But I think there is
other technology out there. I mean, even if you think
of software, for example, there are plenty of other
products where one reasonable use is to make more. I
can purchase software; one reasonable use would be to
make a dozen other copies to give to my friends or sell
on eBay. It's a reasonable use, but it's an infringing
one.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we haven't had
that case either.
(Laughter.)
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: The Court hasn't had that
case exactly, but it did decide Microsoft v. AT&T, and
granted that was on a slightly different issue, but in
that case the Court recognized -- that case, it was
copies from a master disk, and it treated them as
separate copies because they were actually separate
articles, even though it was really easy to do, even
though the actual copying is not done by human hands,
it's done by -- by mechanical processes. In fact, in
that case the Court talked and compared the making of
software to the reproduction through biological
processes, which is what we are talking about here.
And so all we are asking the Court to do
today -- I recognize it's a new technology and to the
extent new technologies require different rules,
Congress is the body that should be making those
different rules. And when Congress has acted in this
area, in the Plant Variety Protection Act and also in
the software context in the Copyright Act, it has not
adopted the wholesale exemption that Petitioner is
asking for here.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Sherry -- I'm sorry. In
everything you've said you agree with Mr. Waxman. There
is this issue in the case where you disagree, which is
the Conditional Sale Doctrine. I am just wondering,
before you finish up, could you say a bit about whether
that doctrine is causing trouble as it presently exists
in the Federal Circuit? In other words, could we just
ignore that doctrine if we wanted to, or is it a very
problematic one that we should take this opportunity to
do something about?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Your Honor, may I?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: I think the Court does
not need to do something about it in this case. I think
Quanta largely decided the issue, even though it didn't
say so explicitly, and as far as I'm aware the Federal
Circuit has not applied their previous version of the
Conditional Sale Doctrine to enforce the post-sale
restrictions since this Court's decision in Quanta.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Waxman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Let me start by answering a couple of, I
guess, science or technology questions that came up
before launching into our doctrinal position.
First of all, Justice Kennedy, soybeans are
soybeans. They are harvested at a particular point in
time, whatever use is going to be made for them. It is
not a plant like a flower, geranium for example, which
has to be left to go to seed, or alfalfa. The bean is
the seed.
All soybeans have to be processed to be used
in any way. If they are going to be planted, they have
to be cleaned before they are put in the ground at the
right time. If they are being fed to either humans or
animals, they have to be processed in a way that
eliminates an enzyme that makes them indigestible by
animals.
Justice Scalia, your question about well,
farmers now just can't do second plantings because
soybeans are put in huge grain elevators and different
varieties are mingled, that is true in the sense that if
one or more of those soybeans were protected by a
patent, the actual growing of the use of those patented
inventions without a license would be infringement,
although, of course, if no glyphosate were put on top of
it, neither the farmer nor Monsanto would ever know that
there was an act of infringement.
But more to the point, farmers -- I mean,
the planting of second crops, that is crop rotation of
interspersing soybeans and winter wheat, is very, very
common. There are hundreds of thousands of soybean
farmers who do this every year.
Mr. Bowman has acknowledged that so far as
he knows, he's the only one who's doing it this way.
But there are plenty of other ways in which he could
obtain a much less expensive crop of -- you know, a
particular variety of soybean, so one that will all grow
to the same height and germinate at the same time. And
in fact, he explained this to the district court in his
response to the motion for summary judgment at page 152a
of the joint appendix.
He said defendant wanted a cheap source of
seed for his second crop beans because of the normal
risks in growing "wheat beans;" that is, the second crop
that follows the harvesting of winter wheat.
Quote, "defendant simply wasn't going to
plant the high priced soybean seed after his wheat
crop." And here's the relevant sentence. "Defendant
could have purchased conventional seed, that is,
non-patented seed, and then saved its offspring for
wheat beans."
In other words, he could have gone and
bought a non-patented -- a bag of non-patented seed for
much less money, and used it as his second crop, or
harvested a portion of it -- and soybeans replicate at a
rate between 20 and 80 times in each generation -- and
have a perpetual source for his second crop thereafter.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he couldn't put the
herbicide on -- he couldn't -- if he went and bought
conventional seeds, not the genetically improved seeds
--
MR. WAXMAN: Exactly.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- then -- then he
wouldn't -- what would the yield be if he puts the
herbicide on it and they are all killed?
MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the -- the
glyphosate resistance doesn't change the yield of a
particular plant, it changes the way you have to control
weeds. And he would not be able to use Monsanto's
technology that would allow aerial application of an
herbicide. He would have to -- if he wanted to buy
plain old, you know, conventional soybeans, he has to
control for weeds in the conventional way.
And here's the very next sentence in his
response to the Court. "Defendant" -- that is, instead
of purchasing conventional seeds and saving them, he
says "Defendant decided to purchase a grain dealer's
commodity grain because he felt there was a good chance
he would obtain mostly grain that would be resistant to
glyphosate," and therefore, he could use Monsanto's
technology without having to pay for it.
Mr. Chief Justice, your question about this
is a new case and -- let me go first to your first
question in the case, which is why would a company ever
want to do this? I think the answer is that without the
ability -- let's talk about soybeans and then broaden it
to other kinds of readily replicable technologies --
without the ability to limit reproduction of soybeans
containing this patented trait, Monsanto could not have
commercialized its invention, and never would have
produced what is, by now, the most popular agricultural
technology in America because, as Ms. Sherry was
pointing out, the sale of the very first Roundup Ready
soybean seed, from which all the trillions of Roundup
Ready soybean seeds in existence now derive, would have,
under Mr. Bowman's theory, fully exhausted not only
Monsanto's rights in that seed that was sold, but in all
progeny unto the -- however many generations
Justice Breyer thinks is "not too many."
I think it's important to understand how
this technology works. The Department of Agriculture
licensed Monsanto to engage in a transformation event;
that is, to introduce its recombinant gene into soybean
germ plasm. It's illegal to do it unless you get a
government license to do it. And you can do it once.
And that is done by the technology company, use --
taking something that's called a gene gun and using the
gene gun to inject recombinant DNA into regular germ
plasm.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean you can do
it once? I don't know what you --
MR. WAXMAN: The -- the Department of
Agriculture authorized Monsanto to engage in -- to
transform natural -- natural plant material with its
recombinant gene in one single event that is referred to
as a transformation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: One shot of a gun.
MR. WAXMAN: I think you may be able to
shoot several -- I don't know whether you can shoot a
whole round or whatever. But in any event, it's one
event.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't rob a bank with
it, though, right?
(Laughter.)
MR. WAXMAN: I, in my mind, have been trying
to figure out what a gene gun looks like. And I don't
know -- I don't know if you could use it to rob a bank.
But the point is -- and the -- the Federal Register site
for the transformation event with respect to Roundup
Ready is -- is provided in a footnote in our brief.
What happens then is that Monsanto uses those
transformed cells to grow a soybean plant.
And that soybean plant produces genetic --
produces seeds or soybeans that have the recombinant
Roundup Ready technology in it. Monsanto then provides
-- in almost all of the cases, Monsanto engages in
licensed sales of those transformed seeds to hundreds of
different seed companies that produce different
varieties, and they make both conventional seed with a
particular varietal makeup and a Roundup Ready version
of that variety.
Monsanto provides the soybeans that it has
transformed to the seed companies, to the hundreds of
seed companies for consideration. Under Mr. Bowman's
theory, that was it for all of Monsanto's rights with
respect to this technology. The very first time it took
an original transformed seed and sold it to a seed
company so that it could bulk up and cross-breed and
produce different varieties, Monsanto had lost all of
its patent rights.
In other words, by go at -- having committed
hundreds of millions of dollars in 13 years to develop
this technology in the very first sale of an article
that practices the patent, it would have exhausted its
rights in perpetuity.
Now, we --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, there is a
worrisome thing on the other side, though, too. And
that is that your position has the -- has the capacity
to make infringers out of everybody. And that is
highlighted actually in this case by how successful this
product is and how large a percentage of the market it
has had.
So that -- you know, seeds can be blown onto
a farmer's farm by wind, and all of a sudden you have
Roundup seeds there and the person -- farmer is
infringing, or there's a 10-year-old who wants to do a
science project of creating a soybean plant, and he goes
to the supermarket and gets some edamame, and it turns
out that it's Roundup seeds.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN: And, you know, these Roundup
seeds are everywhere, it seems to me. There's, what,
90 percent of all the seeds that are around? So it
seems as though -- like pretty much everybody is an
infringer at this point, aren't they?
MR. WAXMAN: Certainly not. Let me make --
let me make three points, starting with the edamame and
moving up to inadvertent infringers.
Edamame is an immature form of the soybean
seed. You can plant edamame --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. I'll change the
hypothetical.
(Laughter.)
MR. WAXMAN: If I take my -- you know, my
Girl Scout troop and have them do a science experiment,
it will rot, but it will not generate. And that --
JUSTICE KAGAN: And I thought I was being so
clever, too.
(Laughter.)
MR. WAXMAN: Well, it also reminds me that
my original answer to Justice Kennedy is wrong, which is
that edamame is taken from the pods before the -- the
thing becomes actually a seed that can be processed in
any other way.
Your point about the ubiquity of Roundup
Ready -- Roundup Ready's use is a fair one. I mean,
this is probably the most rapidly adopted technological
advance in history. The very first Roundup Ready
soybean seed was only made in 1996. And it now is grown
by more than 90 percent of the 275,000 soybean farms in
the United States.
But size -- that is, success -- has never
been thought and can't be thought to affect the contour
of patent rights. You may very -- with soybeans, the
problem of blowing seed is not an issue for soybeans.
Soybeans don't -- I mean, it would take Hurricane Sandy
to blow a soybean into some other farmer's field. And
soybeans, in any event, are -- you know, have perfect
flowers; that is, they contain both the pollen and the
stamen, so that they -- which is the reason that they
breed -- breed true, unlike, for example, corn.
The point that there may be many farmers
with respect to other crops, like alfalfa, that may have
some inadvertent Roundup Ready alfalfa in their fields
may be true, although it's -- it is not well documented.
There would be inadvertent infringement if the farmer
was cultivating a patented crop, but there would be no
enforcement of that.
The farmer wouldn't know, Monsanto wouldn't
know, and in any event, the damages would be zero
because you would ask what the reasonable royalty would
be, and if the farmer doesn't want Roundup Ready
technology and isn't using Roundup Ready technology to
save costs and increase productivity, the -- the royalty
value would be zero.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, is -- I mean, that is
an interesting question because you can imagine -- you
see, this is -- your answer -- this really deals with
all -- it could be with genetic patents, with -- with
hosts of things which are self-replicating.
MR. WAXMAN: Mm-hmm.
JUSTICE BREYER: And some of the
self-replicating items, which are infringing items, end
up inadvertently all over the place. Is there anything
in the patent law that deals with that? Is an
involuntary infringer treated the same under patent law
as a voluntary infringer?
MR. WAXMAN: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is -- is there precautions
that you take? I mean, is there anything in patent law
that helps?
MR. WAXMAN: So infringement is -- unlike
contributory infringement or induced infringement, the
act of infringement, that is a violation of Section
271 --
JUSTICE BREYER: Right.
MR. WAXMAN: -- is a strict liability tort,
but it requires affirmative volitional contact --
conduct. That is, it's not that -- a thing doesn't
infringe; a person infringes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the person plants it.
MR. WAXMAN: The person --
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, he plants it, but
he doesn't even know, you know. He's just got -- we can
imagine a lot of circumstances where this would be a --
where Justice Kagan's question could apply.
MR. WAXMAN: I mean, take the --
JUSTICE BREYER: But you're just saying that
would need a --
MR. WAXMAN: Sure.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- modification in patent
law.
MR. WAXMAN: Of course. I mean, take the
example, and this goes to I think the comment made by
the Chief Justice, that even in the software context, we
haven't had this case yet. You did have this case in --
in Microsoft v. AT&T that involved, you know,
Microsoft's golden disk that has the Windows Operating
System on it, which is patented, and was being exported
overseas for introduction into, you know, computers that
were manufactured overseas. And AT&T's patent, which
was a method of compressing speech, was practiced by the
Windows software.
And this Court held that, although the
writing of the Windows Operating System into computers
in the United States would have infringed the patent,
and when Microsoft did that it did infringe AT&T's
patent, the fact that the copies were made onto the hard
drives of the computer overseas meant that the act of
infringement occurred overseas and there was not an
export of -- of an infringing product for the purposes
of infringing overseas for purposes of Section 271(f).
So I think you have decided in the context
of software, which of course replicates even more
readily than soybeans do or vaccines or cell lines or
plasmids, that the copies that are actually made when
a -- a software is written onto the hard drive of a
computer is a different thing than the disk that was
sent and is infringing, if it occurs within the United
States.
JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about
the other question --
MR. WAXMAN: So the other one --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, I want to go
back to a different question that was asked, which was
the question what do you think we should do about this
other aspect of the case, the licensing aspect? I mean,
I would have thought it doesn't concern Monsanto's
license of generation 1 because, insofar as it's
relevant, here generation 1 carries the license that is
just permissive.
It is to create generation 2. But -- but
they also said something in the circuit about a
license -- about a restriction, implied perhaps, on --
on the use of generation 2 by the grain elevator for
creating generation 3, namely you can't do that.
Now, they -- they thought, the circuit, that
there's some restriction in a license and they have a
doctrine that seems to say that you can restrict
licenses -- through licenses the use of a product after
it's been sold. And that would seem contrary to the
First Sale Doctrine.
MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Let me -- let me answer
your question this way: First of all, we don't think
that there's any need whatsoever for this Court -- we
agree with the government that there's no need for the
Court to address the question of conditional sales and
the extent to which patent law recognizes under some
circumstances conditional sales because in this case the
Federal Circuit did not address that ground which we
advocated and we still advocate, but instead said -- and
I'm reading from 14a of the petition appendix.
"Even if Monsanto's patent rights in the
commodity seeds are exhausted, such a conclusion would
be of no consequence because once a grower like Bowman
plants the commodity seeds containing Monsanto's Roundup
Ready technology and the next generation of seed
develops, the grower has created a newly infringing
article."
In other words, what the Federal Circuit
decided, and it is entirely correct and it should be
affirmed on that basis, is what you're calling, I think
generation 3, let's say that for simplicity's sake,
since generation 1 is the original soybean sold by
Monsanto to seed companies, let's just say that the bags
of soybean seeds that farmers go to purchase from seed
dealers is called generation N and they are licensed to
produce generation N plus 1. But then, what about N
plus 2?
So what the Federal Circuit held is N plus 2
has never been sold. It was created, it exists without
a sale, and because a sale is the sine qua non of patent
exhaustion, which is also referred to as first sale,
there is no exhaustion.
Alternatively, the Federal Circuit said in
any event, even when exhaustion applies, it only
privileges the using or selling of the article sold; as
Your Honor's questions pointed out originally, it never
privileges the making of a new infringing product.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could -- could you prevail
in this case if we focused just on use rather than make?
MR. WAXMAN: If you're referring to
generation N plus 2, the answer is yes, because those
are newly infringing products with no exhaustion of
Monsanto's rights, and as a consequence farmers have no
authority to use, make, sell, or offer to sell without
Monsanto's authorization. That is a -- just a
straightforward application of Section 271.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, I want to go
back to Justice Breyer's question and reformulate it as
a different question, with I think the same answer --
MR. WAXMAN: Okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but I just want to
make sure you and the government are exactly on the same
page.
Both of you are suggesting, I think -- that
was Ms. Sherry's last response -- that we were explicit
enough in Quanta and we don't have to address whatever
lingering confusion the Federal Circuit may have with
respect to conditional sales at all in this case?
MR. WAXMAN: I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're -- you're telling
us we don't need to reach that prong and we shouldn't.
MR. WAXMAN: I'm -- I agree that you don't
need to reach the prong and you shouldn't.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand we don't
need to, but the question is should we? Is there a
need --
MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- generally in -- in
clarifying some lingering confusion?
MR. WAXMAN: I think that -- I think that an
appropriate case will come up where it will be important
for you to determine that. And our third argument,
which wasn't addressed by the Federal Circuit and isn't
necessary to affirm, is that conditional sales are not
ipso facto unenforceable; that is, a -- in an instant --
everybody understands that if instead of selling
technology, you lease it, and you sign a license that
imposes conditions on that lease, you know, unless they
are unreasonable, conditions that are reasonably related
to exploitation of the invention are enforceable. Mr.
Bowman acknowledges that. Everyone acknowledges that.
Our single submission here is that where you
have a technology that cannot be leased because it will
consume itself in whatever use one makes of it, and
therefore has to be -- an article embodying the
invention has to be sold and where the invention cannot
be commercialized if it -- if the inventor has to
realize its full costs of development and a reasonable
rate of return on the first sale, the fact that there is
this necessary sale in order to commercialize the
invention cannot ipso facto make all such conditions
unenforceable. And that's all -- if you were to reach
the conditional sale issue in this case, that is all we
think this case stands for. And the reason I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Actually then you do
have a different position than the government does.
MR. WAXMAN: Yes, and I think the reason, if
we take it out of the soybean area, let's look at
vaccines. Because the Roundup Ready gene essentially
immunizes soybean plants from the herbicide in the same
way that a life-saving vaccine will immunize individuals
that receive it from some external -- it wouldn't be a
herbicide -- a life threat.
Okay. Vaccines are live. They have live
cultures; they can regenerate themselves. If a company
develops the vaccine for, you know, H1 -- I shouldn't be
using -- an important life-saving vaccine --
(Laughter.)
MR. WAXMAN: -- it's unsupportable to say
that you cannot sell a quantity of that vaccine without
exhausting all of your rights in it.
I mean, when -- when Schering-Plough or
Bristol-Myers develops a vaccine and sells some of it to
CVS so I can go in and get injected, they haven't lost
all of their patent rights in that vaccine. CVS can't
turn around and become a competitor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Simplifying this case,
you can't take the person who's been given the vaccine
and take vials of their blood and keep selling it? Is
that your --
MR. WAXMAN: Yes, and keep -- well, keep
replicating it in competition. Take another example --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is that how it
works?
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I mean I'm
serious. I mean, your example, it seems to me, is not
quite on point because it's not a situation where the
intended use of the vaccine necessarily results in
regeneration of it. In your hypothetical, CVS was going
to some lab and making more, right?
MR. WAXMAN: Well, CVS was presumably buying
it either from the manufacturer or another lab. But the
point here is that to take the software example, if I go
to, you know, Staples and buy the Windows operating
system on a disk, I don't have the authority to put it
in a disk replicator and press a button and make a
million copies of it. And --
JUSTICE BREYER: But you don't need that
because in each instance, as you say, you are making new
ones. It's the making of the new ones, not the use of
the old ones, where you prevent that from being done.
MR. WAXMAN: Yeah. Well, let me -- the
example that comes to mind is, of course, poor
Dr. Chakrabarty who, you know, invented a new man-made
bacteria. Bacteria replicate themselves, unlike
soybeans which require human intervention. I mean, the
notion --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then you use the word
"use."
MR. WAXMAN: Excuse me?
JUSTICE BREYER: Then you use the word "use"
and you get to the same place.
MR. WAXMAN: I mean, my submission about --
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't think you can think
of an example. I mean, you say -- I don't think you can
think of an example where if you win on the other
ground, you can produce a bad result for the
manufacturer or the inventor because you haven't treated
the conditional sale like a license. I'm not saying you
can't, I just can't think of one.
MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Here's one. I will use
something that doesn't make itself because we think that
is covered by the new article. Let's say that I invent
a new, miraculous new machine.  I get a patent for it.
I want people to be able -- I'm going to
commercialize it. Or I'm going to license with people
to commercialize it, but I want people to be able to
study it and research it. And so, like Monsanto with
its seeds, I sign -- I provide a copy of the machine to
MIT, with a research-only license; that is, you can use
this machine to figure out how it works and develop new
applications and all that sort of stuff.
If that sale is exhausting for all purposes,
I can't prevent MIT or a third party that MIT provides
the machine for --
JUSTICE BREYER: So lease it.
MR. WAXMAN: -- to go into competition with
JUSTICE BREYER: So lease it.
MR. WAXMAN: Yes, but you can't lease
articles like software and, you know, soybeans that
consume themselves in any use, other than an art
experiment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I do have this problem
that goes back to Justice Scalia's example. What about
the commodity bin that has 2 percent of the patented
seeds in them? Now, you get away from the article by
saying, oh, well, almost all seeds are Roundup these
days. But let's have some different commodity where
there are three or four different patented items, but 1
percent, 2 percent of the seeds are in the bin. You
can't -- you can't sell those. That seems to me a very
extreme result.
MR. WAXMAN: Well, I mean, when you say you
can't sell them. So, as Ms. Sherry was pointing out --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can't sell them if
they know they are going to be used for seeds, and you
can't use them for seeds even though there is only
1 percent of the seeds?
MR. WAXMAN: That would be true even if this
case came out another way, Justice Kennedy. First of
all, because grain elevators are prohibited by State and
Federal law from selling seed, period. They sell --
they buy grain and they sell grain. They can't sell
seed.
Number 2, almost all varieties of soybeans
or other crop plants are currently protected by the --
under the patent -- the Plant Variety Protection Act.
As this Court and Congress recognized, the requisites
for getting a certificate are -- I mean, it's like a
registration requirement.
And we know from J.E.M., and the relevant
provision of the PVPA, that it is unlawful to divert
crops that are protected by a PVPA certificate for
reproductive uses. So irrespective of all of this,
whatever happens, even if there is only 1 percent of
patented soybeans in a grain elevator, the grain
elevator can't sell it as seed both under the Federal
and State seed laws and under the Patent Variety
Protection Act.
That's why the solution for farmers like
Monsanto -- like Mr. Bowman, is to simply buy
conventional seed, multiply it, you know, 20, 30, 40,
50, 80 times in a single generation and save 1/80th of
it to replant in his second crop, if he doesn't want to
buy Roundup Ready technology for his second crop and use
the glyphosate aerially.
Unless the Court has further questions, we
will submit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Waxman.
Mr. Walters, you have five minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK P. WALTERS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALTERS: I'd like to first address the
statement that this is not a traditional farming
practice. It may be occasional, when a farmer is in a
real desperate situation, or it may apply to
Mr. Bowman's situation, where he wanted a very cheap
source of seed for his second crop.
But in the record at 153a, among other
places, he discusses how he's gone to the grain elevator
over the years a number of times, and how other farmers
have gone to the grain elevator for generations. So a
ruling in favor of Monsanto here would effectively
eliminate that seed --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree that it's
unlawful for grain elevators to sell it for replanting?
MR. WALTERS: No. I do not. And what he is
referring to is State labeling laws that prevent grain
elevators from actually scooping up grain, packaging it
up and saying this is seed, because they all look alike
to -- to the eye. And so grain elevators are certainly
not allowed to dupe seed purchasers, but those laws are
there to protect the seed purchasers.
Mr. Bowman bought grain without any
restrictions on how he could use it. That broke no
laws, and it does not violate the PVPA. I mean,
Monsanto didn't assert a PVPA certificate. Surely it
has them. Did not assert them in this case and could
not assert them in this case because there's no single
variety that Mr. Bowman planted. So that's not a good
argument.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what about
Mr. Waxman's suggestion that we've already decided this
in Microsoft v. AT&T?
MR. WALTERS: That case is not on point,
Your Honor. That had to do with 271(f), and actually
came out on the side of more restrictive patent rights.
And this is not like software. This is an invention
that the only way to use the invention -- now, repeat,
the only way to use the invention -- is to plant it and
to grow more seeds.
So if you don't apply the Exhaustion
Doctrine and allow someone to use it, you're choosing
patent rights over personal property rights, and that's
never been done in 150 years of this Court's exhaustion
case law.
JUSTICE BREYER: Don't people or animals eat
them?
MR. WALTERS: That is certainly a use, but
it's not the invention.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then why is it the
only way you can do is to plant them? That isn't the
only thing you could do with it.
MR. WALTERS: Well, that's not use of the --
JUSTICE BREYER: You can go buy them in the
grain elevator and sell them for other things.
MR. WALTERS: It's not use of the
invention, Justice Breyer. And exhaustion is about
conferring on the purchaser a right to use the
invention. There's no limit to Monsanto's --
JUSTICE BREYER: The invented product. The
invented thing. The invented aspect of the seed is it
has a gene in it that repels some other insecticide or
something that they have. I understand that.
MR. WALTERS: The same argument came up in
Quanta, Your Honor, with --
JUSTICE BREYER: You don't use that. I
don't think they used that particular -- well, go ahead.
You go ahead.
MR. WALTERS: There were other uses for the
computer chips, of course, that were asserted. And the
key was that those computer chips practiced the patent.
And you would swallow up the Exhaustion Doctrine
entirely if we just could think of other uses for these
things that have been sold.
The key is, does it use -- is the purchaser
allowed to use the invention? And under Monsanto's
theory, the purchaser isn't allowed to do that. And
that's no Exhaustion Doctrine at all --
JUSTICE BREYER: The people buying from
grain elevators are mostly people who take these
chips -- whatever they are, the seeds -- and they sell
them for making tofu, they sell them to eat, or
this -- there are loads of uses, aren't there?
MR. WALTERS: But the only use of the
invention is to plant it, and that's the use that
Mr. Bowman makes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but that's --
nothing prevents him from planting it. What he is
prevented from doing is using the -- the consequences of
that planting, the second generation seeds, for another
planting. That's all he is prevented from doing. He
can plant and harvest and eat or sell. He just can't
plant, harvest, and then replant.
MR. WALTERS: So -- the judgment in this
case was based on acres planted, and so I'm not sure how
many -- we talked a bit about the N plus 2 generation,
and we don't know in the record what the N plus 2
generation was, in terms of his sales or his yields.
That wasn't before the district court on summary
judgment. So I'm not sure how you could affirm based on
the judgment below, which was a finding that conditional
sales prevented the application of the Exhaustion
Doctrine.
The other thing --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, I didn't
follow that answer to Justice Scalia's question.
MR. WALTERS: Could you ask it again?
JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, you're saying
that you are preventing him from using it. He's not
prevented from using it. He can use it for what it's
meant for, for raising a crop. He just cannot use the
product -- that new crop -- for replanting. That's all.
He has to sell that new crop for feed or for some other
purpose. But to say that -- that he's prevented from
using what he has bought is simply not true. He can use
it, plant it, and harvest the crop.
MR. WALTERS: But you're saying that there's
no exhaustion in the progeny where he owns that seed
outright.
With that, we'll submit, and we'll ask that
the Court of Appeals be reversed.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
