Harrington v. Richter.
Mr. Colombo.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J. COLOMBO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COLOMBO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The California Supreme Court's denial of
Respondent's ineffective counsel claim was entitled to
the deferential review for reasonableness prescribed by
28 U.S.C. section 2254(d). By its plain terms, nothing
in 2254(d) requires a State court to render a reasoned
or explained decision, nor is there anything in section
2254(d) that would treat Strickland claims differently
from any other Federal constitutional claim.
Here, the Ninth Circuit failed to give the
State court decision the proper deference -- indeed,
double deference -- it was owed. Rather than applying
this Court's proper -- excuse me -- clearly established
Strickland standard, the court of appeals employed its
own eccentric rule that essentially requires counsel to
always consult with and present expert testimony in
every case in which the prosecution --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do -- how do we know
that the -- the California court even reached that
question? Because there was -- wasn't there a motion to
deny review as -- as -- wasn't there a time bar question
raised?
MR. COLOMBO: There was a procedural bar
that was argued in the informal opposition to the
petition for writ of habeas corpus that had been
requested by the California Supreme Court. It did not
invoke that bar as a basis for denying relief. Under
well-established --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, it said -- it
just said denied on -- on the merits. And it's still
not clear to me how to -- pardon me. It just said
"denied"?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's still not clear to me
how to distinguish that, between denied, deny -- do we
say, when there's a one-line order, as in this case,
where it says simply "deny," it is presumptively on the
merits? I mean, how -- how do we interpret that?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes. In fact, that is a
well-settled and long-established practice, local
practice. It's well-understood by not only the
litigants, but the State and Federal courts of the Ninth
Circuit, dating back to the Ninth Circuit's 1974
decision in Harris v. Superior Court.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then it is presumptively
on the merits?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: They don't -- I mean, is
that the way it's stated? Don't let me use my
formulation. What's -- what's the State's formulation?
MR. COLOMBO: The State's formulation is
that the silent or so-called summary denial is on the
merits, unless the State court indicates otherwise in --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, that can't be a Ninth
Circuit rule. I mean, that has to depend upon each --
each of the States in the Ninth Circuit, no?
I mean, some State could -- could have a
different rule, I assume. You're -- you're telling us,
however, that California has that rule?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes. And that rule, again,
has been well-established --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But did --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if I'm on the
California court and I have two choices -- one is to say
denied, no explanation, as this case; the other is to
say denied on the merits -- if I have those two options,
then why are they both on the merits?
MR. COLOMBO: Again, because it has
certainly been well-understood for at least three and a
half decades that when the California Supreme Court
renders a so-called silent denial, that it is on the
merits unless the court ordered --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what is the leading
California authority on that proposition?
MR. COLOMBO: That would be In re Robbins,
in which --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the Robbins case.
Okay.
MR. COLOMBO: -- which is discussed in our
brief, as well as in the reply brief.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Thank you.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I don't know
that you answered Justice Kennedy's question.
MR. COLOMBO: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know you
answered his question.
His question was: If you can deny or deny
on the merits, what's the difference between the two?
MR. COLOMBO: There really is no
substantive --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's two choices, so
they have to have different meanings in some way.
MR. COLOMBO: I would submit that there is
no substantive distinction between an order that simply
reflects denied versus one that reflects denied on the
merits.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They showed us the
docket for that day --
MR. COLOMBO: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- of the denial here,
and there were different ones. If it's the same court
taking action, why would they choose one over the other
for particular cases?
MR. COLOMBO: Well, I submit that there
could be any number of reasons, and not the least of
which this Court addressed itself in Carey v. Saffold,
just a couple of terms ago.
As the Court recognized, that sometimes the
State court may choose to include the phrase "on the
merits" to give a reviewing court an alternative basis
for understanding why relief was denied, or to let, for
example, a pro se petitioner, who are typically the ones
that present petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the
California Supreme Court, know that their case wasn't
denied because of some mere procedural technicality, but
because the claim itself was substantively meritless.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's what --
that's feeding into your adversary's argument, that when
the court does a summary denial, you don't know whether
it's procedural or merits.
That's his argument. You're adopting his
argument?
MR. COLOMBO: No. No. Our argument is that
it's a long-settled, established question of local
practice that when the California Supreme Court renders
a -- a silent denial, simply says "petition for writ of
habeas corpus denied," it is understood by the court's
litigants, has been well-established for over three and
a half decades: That is a merits decision.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would the
California Supreme Court do if they all agree that this
application should be denied, but two of them think it's
for a procedural bar -- timeliness -- and then others
think it has no merit, and they say just "denied," but
there's no majority for either one?
MR. COLOMBO: In -- in that instance, then
the claim would be presumed -- assuming that the court's
order simply reflected "petition denied," again, it's
well understood that that would be a denial on the
merits.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though, in fact, it
wasn't?
MR. COLOMBO: Well, we can't know that. In
fact, it would be purely speculative to suggest that
that's what the courts have done.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we -- so there is that
possibility -- even though there is that possibility, we
should assume it was on the merits.
What about -- I mean, you said this is three
decades, but we are told that the California Supreme
Court has this pattern of saying merits when it's on the
merits; giving a citation, if it's a procedural bar to
the -- a procedural fault; and when it says simply
"denied," that's most likely that they couldn't all
agree on a reason.
MR. COLOMBO: Well, I would respectfully
disagree with that suggestion, that because it simply
says "denied" without including the phrase "on the
merits," it's not a merits determination.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's what they
would say if, in fact, they were divided, right?
MR. COLOMBO: I'm sorry. What?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If, in fact, the court
was divided, all agree that the petition should be
denied, but there's no majority for any particular
reason, merits or procedure, they -- they would say
"petition denied," right?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes, if it's -- if it's a
straight silent denial, and the -- the court doesn't
invoke either a procedural bar to deny relief or forgo
the procedural bar and find that the claims are
substantively meritless in any event.
What I submit that the silent denial simply
means is the court didn't agree that there was a basis
for invoking a procedural bar; the claims were
meritless, and it simply orders the petition denied,
which is, again, well-understood. It's a
well-established practice in the -- in the State and
Federal courts in California that those silent denials
are merits determinations, which are entitled, then, to
AEDPA deference under the statute.
Even the Ninth Circuit, in the en banc
decision in this case, recognized that the California
Supreme Court's silent denial was a merits determination
which it then had to review.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- does the court
sometimes deny explicitly on procedural grounds?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes. And when the court does
that, it will reflect such in its orders. That's
discussed in footnote 34 in the Robbins case, which we
discuss in our brief in this Court.
The court says when it's going to invoke as
a basis for denying relief on a Federal claim, it will
indicate that in its order. If it's relying on a
separate State procedural default, for example, if it's
a successive petition of the claimant's previously
raised on direct appeal or --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're saying that if
it's on both grounds, if they agree with both the
procedural and the merits ground, they may well just --
just deny without any explanation? But if they deny
only on the procedural ground, they will -- they will
say it?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.
JUSTICE ALITO: If you looked back at a
sample of the cases in which they have simply said
"denied," would we find cases in which no procedural bar
was raised by the State?
MR. COLOMBO: I don't know the answer to
that question, because I haven't researched to find out
whether or not in any of those cases, like in this case,
the California Supreme Court directed the Attorney
General to file an informal opposition or some other
pleading that would have addressed that question.
Without knowing whether or not there was briefing on
this -- those particular cases, and there's no
suggestion in Respondent's brief that that was done, I
couldn't -- I couldn't guess on that.
JUSTICE BREYER: Was there a procedural
issue in this case before the California Supreme Court?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: What was that?
MR. COLOMBO: A timeliness bar, among
others.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What was the basis of
that?
MR. COLOMBO: That the claim of ineffective
assistance could and should have been discovered at an
earlier time than when it was presented to the
California Supreme Court under California's timeliness
rule, which would require that counsel present the claim
of, in this case, ineffective assistance upon learning
of the factual basis to support such a claim.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it took 14 months for
this petition to be filed to the State court. Do you
have cases that show whether those 14 months are
presumptively unreasonable under California law?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes. And that's basically the
Clark case that's also discussed in our brief.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there is great
validity, you think, to your timeliness -- so this
timeliness claim. And despite that, you believe the
silent denial was an adjudication on the merits.
MR. COLOMBO: Yes, because I would submit
that when the State argued that the claim was
procedurally barred by reason of untimeliness and the
State court did not invoke that as a bar to relief, it
necessarily concluded that the claims were
unmeritorious, because they otherwise could have been
barred by a procedural bar, but they --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you just told me
that if they -- if they agreed both with the procedural
ground and the merits ground, they could issue just --
just a denial without explanation.
MR. COLOMBO: That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now you're telling me
that -- the opposite.
MR. COLOMBO: If I said that, then I
misspoke or perhaps I misunderstood the Court's
question.
What I'm suggesting is if the court invokes
as a basis for denying a Federal claim a State
procedural bar, it will reflect that in its order.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That will always be in the
order.
MR. COLOMBO: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: But if, in this case, they
did reject it on a procedural ground, and it was a
reasonable ground that they applied consistently, then
the Ninth Circuit or the Federal courts couldn't
consider the claim at all; is that right?
MR. COLOMBO: That's correct, assuming that
the Federal courts agreed that the State bar wasn't --
JUSTICE BREYER: If, in fact, the -- they
are right, if in fact that the State was correct that
this is procedurally barred -- they should have raised
it earlier; they didn't -- and if that was correct and
reasonable and proper under both Federal and State law,
then you shouldn't be in this subject at all; is that
right or not?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes. That's correct. Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: So, normally, to decide a
matter on a substantive -- to have a presumption that
they were deciding it substantively rather than
procedurally will help a defendant, though not in this
case.
MR. COLOMBO: That's correct.
JUSTICE ALITO: But you didn't raise -- you
haven't argued that it's procedurally barred.
MR. COLOMBO: Not in the Federal court, no.
JUSTICE ALITO: So you may have waived that.
On the other hand, your opponent has, as I gather, until
they got here, never argued that it was based on
anything other than the merits. So they might have
waived that.
MR. COLOMBO: Yes. I would submit that --
JUSTICE ALITO: So everything might be
waived here.
(Laughter.)
MR. COLOMBO: Well, I'm not sure that -- we
never invoked a procedural bar in the Federal court
insofar as the presentation of these particular claims.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One thing that's not
waived is the second question, or the first, which is
the merits of the Strickland claim.
MR. COLOMBO: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And maybe this would
be a good point for you to switch to that.
MR. COLOMBO: I would -- I would be pleased
to discuss that with the Court.
We have argued in our brief, and I think
it's crystal clear: First of all, the Ninth Circuit's
grossly overbroad explication of a so-called Strickland
standard that would require counsel in every case in
which the prosecution presents forensic --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did they say that?
MR. COLOMBO: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did they explicitly say
in every single case you have to consult an expert?
MR. COLOMBO: No. They didn't say that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or did they say, in the
circumstances of this case, given the nature of the
issues, that consultation would have been effective?
MR. COLOMBO: That is -- that certainly is
one reading of the Ninth Circuit's opinion. I submit
that the more correct reading, so to speak, would be if
the Court looks at the language that the Ninth Circuit
uses in -- in discussing this standard, they essentially
say, since counsel should have reasonably expected the
prosecution was going to present this forensic evidence,
he should have not only investigated it, he should have
consulted with experts. He should have presented them.
And I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We could take issue with
-- with the timing of that consultation, but let's
assume that it turns out afterwards that if he had
consulted an expert, that that expert would have told
him that one of those blood spots absolutely had to be
Klein's near the bedroom. You would have no quarrel
with saying it would have been ineffective for that
counsel to have failed to confer with an expert,
wouldn't you?
MR. COLOMBO: No, I would disagree with that
for the reasons --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You would say, even if
the expert were to give that kind -- an expert would
have given that kind of exculpatory information, that
that would not have been ineffective?
MR. COLOMBO: Let me start by saying this:
First of all, we can't know and no one can ever know
that Klein's, or Johnson's blood, for that matter, was
in this blood pool that the Ninth Circuit --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not talking --
MR. COLOMBO: -- focused its attention on.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I gave you a
hypothetical different from the facts of this case. I
take the Ninth Circuit to be saying, if you're in an
area, and you are a lawyer, where you have no expertise
and your case depends on a technical issue, it behooves
you to at least talk to an expert to find out if you are
on the right track. And if you fail to and you get
something that's completely exculpatory, you're
ineffective.
So I posed the hypothetical: If an expert
would have looked at all of these test results and said,
that has to be Klein's blood there, it can't be
Johnson's for this reason, you are positing that even
under that circumstance there would not have been
ineffectiveness for the failure to consult with an
expert? Is that what you are telling us?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes. And the reason why I say
that is because it's important to remember that the
critical forensic evidence in this case, that the jury
was --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep wanting to
return to this case, and I respect why you want to, but
I am positing a hypothetical that underlies, I think,
the Ninth Circuit's point.
MR. COLOMBO: In response --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It may well be in this
case that the consultation would have resulted in no
prejudice. That's different from whether it was
effective to ignore a consultation. Those are two
different questions.
MR. COLOMBO: I suppose, accepting the
Court's hypothetical as stated, that counsel was aware
of and failed to consult with an expert knowing that
that testimony would be presented, could be deemed
deficient performance under --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- do you think it
makes a difference whether the expert would have --
would have helped or not? I mean, counsel has to make
that decision of whether to call an expert ex ante, not
ex post. I mean, you -- we shouldn't evaluate his
decision on the basis of whether, even if it's a
1,000-to-1 long shot, it turns out that that testimony
would have been very successful.
Don't we have to examine it ex ante before
he knows what the result will be?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes, and I think it's
important to look at -- as this Court has described in
the Strickland case itself, we have to view from
counsel's perspective at that time. What did he know?
What could he have reasonably expected the prosecution's
evidence to be? How is he going to meet that evidence?
What tactical or strategic choices --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Justice Sotomayor's
hypothetical would include the situation where he
doesn't know that the prosecution is going to introduce
any expert testimony. He knows that there is blood
there. He should -- he should get his own expert,
whether or not the prosecution uses one. Right?
I mean, can it never be ineffective
assistance not to call an expert where -- so long as the
prosecution doesn't have one on the other side?
MR. COLOMBO: No, I would submit that it
certainly could be deficient performance if counsel
fails to investigate readily available evidence that
could lead to exculpatory evidence in support of his
client's defense. That's the hypothetical, I believe,
that Her Honor asked a moment ago.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, could? Really? Is
that your test? It could -- there's some remote
possibility?
MR. COLOMBO: Again, I think it would be --
it's going to be fact-specific depending upon the kind
of case. It may well be in a given case that forensic
testimony would not be controverted, would not be
disputed. It wouldn't be relevant, necessarily, to the
defense.
Let's say, for example, that there was no
dispute that the person who committed the offense left
DNA evidence at the crime scene, and it's clear that the
DNA evidence suggests that the perpetrator was the
defendant. Then the court -- then the defense attorney
isn't going to profit by consulting an expert to dispute
an indisputable issue.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't it the reality
that sometimes the defense doesn't want to have an
expert, because the expert may turn up findings that are
adverse for him, and it's better for the defense counsel
to just leave things murky and argue to the jury that
the State didn't produce the evidence, either? That's a
perfectly legitimate strategy, isn't it?
MR. COLOMBO: It is. And I think that in
many instances that would -- that would inform a defense
attorney's strategic choices as to how to present the
defense in a given case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Colombo --
JUSTICE ALITO: Unless the -- sorry.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Colombo, you -- you
say in any event, leaving aside the question of whether
there was ineffective assistance of counsel, even
assuming there was, there would -- there would be no
prejudice in this case.
MR. COLOMBO: That's correct. Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And could you just
summarize why you say there would be no prejudice?
MR. COLOMBO: Well, first of all, I think
it's important to recognize that the expert declarations
that were proffered by Respondent in support of his
habeas petition really don't challenge the testimony
that was presented in the State trial by the State's
experts, specifically the question of whether or not the
murder victim could have been moved from, supposedly,
the area outside the bedroom door onto the couch.
The testimony at trial suggested that that
distance was somewhere between about 20 and 25 feet.
There was no evidence at the crime scene that suggested
the victim had moved from the point where he was shot
with a fatal gunshot wound.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- the
pool of blood? There was one expert affidavit that said
something about -- that Johnson, standing up, could not
have produced that amount of blood.
MR. COLOMBO: I think the actual expert
declaration suggested that the prosecution's theory, as
the expert described it, could be eliminated, because
Johnson could not have bled into the blood pool
sufficient to have formed it by merely standing and
waiting for the police to arrive.
I think it's important to realize the
distinction between the prosecutor's theory which he
propounded in his closing argument versus the evidence
that the jury actually heard at trial from the State's
own blood-spatter expert that suggested in order for --
for Klein to have been moved from the point where the
blood pool had formed onto the couch where his body was
discovered by the police, there would have been some
trail or some indicia, some evidence that would have
suggested that he had to have been moved from that
point.
And the more important question, I suppose,
would be, as the dissenting opinion pointed out in this
case: Why would the victim have been moved if he had
been shot at that location? Why would he have been
moved onto the couch?
It certainly makes no sense for another
victim, who's already shot, who's intoxicated, who's
wounded and moving around in the house -- why would he
have wanted to have moved the victim of the gunshot
wound to the head from point A to point B? It just
doesn't make any sense. And there has never been
anything in any of Respondent's experts' declarations
that suggests a rational explanation for how or why that
could have happened. Without --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the -- on the no
prejudice issue, are you relying just on what
happened -- what was found at the scene of the crime? I
mean, you said it's implausible that Klein would have
been moved with no trail of blood at all. So, you say,
therefore no prejudice.
Any -- anything else that goes into your no
prejudice argument?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes. I think for all of the
reasons that are discussed in the dissenting opinion at
pages 193a to 194a of the petition for writ of
certiorari -- excuse me -- of the appendix.
As the dissenting opinion points out, it
certainly was -- there's no evidence in the various
experts' declarations that suggests, first of all, why
the jury would have believed Respondent's trial
testimony that after having essentially partied with the
two victims for several hours the night before, they
suddenly leave, go back to their place of employment,
come back two hours later to return property and a
firearm to another occupant of the house that they had
no reason to believe was actually there; then they are
suddenly surprised by these two victims; that there is a
spontaneous gunfight that ensues involving a firearm
that's never found, that's never attributed to either of
the two victims in the house, that could have only been
attributable to the Respondent himself.
So the jury had all of that evidence to
consider, and we balance that against these -- as I,
again, described them -- inconclusive and speculative
expert opinions that are proffered in support of
Respondent's habeas petition. The jury could not have
been persuaded to find the defendant not guilty, even
had that evidence been introduced.
So, necessarily, Petitioner could --
Respondent could not have been prejudiced by the failure
to introduce that evidence, assuming that that evidence
was, in fact, available and could have been presented in
this case at the time of Respondent's trial.
JUSTICE ALITO: Was there additional
physical evidence found not at the scene?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes. In fact, the -- the
other thing that really tied the Respondent into this
crime was that there was an expended casing at the crime
scene that matched perfectly with a loaded firearm
magazine with the exact same kind of bullets and a box
full of the same exact bullets in the Respondent's house
when the officer served a search warrant, along with the
stolen gun safe and some evidence that there was
marijuana there, which the victim -- the surviving
victim was -- admitted to be a marijuana dealer.
JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you a question
about California procedure?
Is what happened here unusual? Is there --
doesn't -- does the prosecution have an obligation to
provide notice before trial of its intention to call
expert witnesses?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes. Under California
discovery rules, the prosecution would have to disclose
to the defense any evidence it intends to introduce,
either by way of lay testimony or expert testimony,
before the trial commences.
JUSTICE ALITO: And if the defendant
requests that, does -- what's the defendant's reciprocal
obligation, if any?
MR. COLOMBO: The defendant would have to
disclose any witnesses that he or she intends to
introduce at trial, including expert testimony and any
reports supporting such experts.
Unless the Court has any further questions,
I'd like to reserve my remaining time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Colombo.
MR. COLOMBO: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gardner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD GARDNER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GARDNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Court has invited briefing in the
additional question presented on the application of
AEDPA in this case, and in light of the Court's many
questions this morning, I want to address that. But I
did want to clear up one piece of information that seems
to be confusing in the record, and if I can start with
that.
This was in response, I think, to a question
you asked, Justice Ginsburg, regarding the -- the
prejudice prong of the Strickland claim. And the
question was: Why is it -- why is it not -- why is it
harmless? And counsel suggested that there was an
absence of blood between the blood pool and the couch.
Detective Bell testified to that.
And I just want to clear up, because I know
this -- this bit was confusing in the briefs, too: That
is not what Detective Bell testified to. If you look at
pages 181 and 195 in the reporter's transcript in
Exhibit R5, you will see that Detective Bell says, yes,
there were drops leading away from the couch; yes, there
were drops leading away from the blood pool.
And in fact, Exhibit R5 is a picture of the
couch, and you can indeed see --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the point
was that there was no trail from the bed. I mean, the
theory was that Klein was removed from the bed to the
couch.
And I thought that the point that the --
that counsel for the State emphasized was, did the -- if
someone were moved from the bed, taken to the living
room couch, you would have expected to see a trail of
blood from the bed. And there wasn't that.
MR. GARDNER: Indeed. But the State's
theory -- the defense theory was that the body had been
moved from the blood pool -- not the bed -- the blood
pool to the couch. And the State's response, in its
briefing and today at oral argument, was that there was
no blood trail between the blood pool and the couch.
And, indeed, that's not what Detective Bell testified
to. He said there were drops outside the blood pool,
drops outside the couch, and when asked if there was
blood in the carpeting in between, he said he did not
remember how much blood there was in between.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so the idea is
that Johnson drags Klein. This is your theory, right?
Because you are not suggesting he could have lifted
Klein and walked him over, are you?
MR. GARDNER: Yes, I think he could have
lifted him, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Really? Did you
have an expert testify to that?
MR. GARDNER: No.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did you get expert
testimony about that or an expert report about that?
MR. GARDNER: No. There was no -- there was
no expert testimony about the ability of someone to --
to lift a weight.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you think you
can assume that he could lift the weight. How much did
Klein weigh?
MR. GARDNER: I think he weighed between 150
and 160 pounds.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And Johnson?
MR. GARDNER: I think about the same, Your
Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And you say
that he could have dragged him from the pool to the
couch because there were drops along the way.
MR. GARDNER: I'm saying that -- that the
testimony and -- and the suggestion that there was no
trail of blood between the blood pool and the couch is
not consistent with what Detective Bell testified to.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. --
JUSTICE ALITO: And what is your theory
about why he -- why Johnson would have a motive to go
through this exertion? He's -- he's wounded. And let's
say there really was a gun -- a gun fight, and Klein
fell someplace else. Johnson wants to make it seem like
Klein was -- that there wasn't any gun fight.
Why -- why is it so valuable to him to move
Klein's body from the location where you think he fell
to the couch?
MR. GARDNER: Well, if he's -- if he falls
in the bedroom doorway, Your Honor, and he falls in a
crossfire, then Johnson is in some ways culpable. Now,
we don't know what the extent of his culpability is, but
if he's involved in firing the first shot, he is
culpable.
Putting Klein on the couch and having as
State's theory that Klein is shot in cold blood on the
couch eliminates his culpability, or at least eliminates
the risk of it.
JUSTICE ALITO: But he could have -- if he's
going to make up a story, he could have made up the
story that Klein jumped up and he was shot without
having engaged in any firing himself, and he fell
wherever he fell. Putting him on the couch doesn't seem
to -- unless I'm missing something and I wish you'd
explain it -- doesn't seem to aid this purportedly false
story very much.
And if you weigh whatever benefit there is
from that against the exertion of moving this guy, it
doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. But
maybe there's something there that's not apparent.
MR. GARDNER: Well, I can only say that if
Klein is caught in a crossfire, then Johnson is
culpable. And let's remember, he has drugs in the
house. He has scales. He has all sorts of drug --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't he wipe up the
blood? I mean, what -- what good is it to simply put
him on the couch when you leave a pool of blood showing
that that's where he was shot?
MR. GARDNER: Yes, I don't doubt that in
retrospect he could have come up with a better plan,
Your Honor.
(Laughter.)
MR. GARDNER: But I do think it's important
to realize that this plan, at least on its face and
initially, in terms of his adrenaline response, is going
to get him out of a crossfire scenario.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What other --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there's a lot
of talk about the importance of this pool of blood, but
as I read Detective Bell's testimony, he never posited
-- or talks about how that pool was formed. Only your
expert does that.
What Bell does talk about, however, is that
there's a high-velocity blood splatter in front of the
couch and that the pooling of blood on Klein's face
shows that he was shot there.
Your experts do nothing to refute that
testimony, which was really the basis of -- of Bell's
testimony. He had nothing to say about the pool of
blood. He talked about why Klein was shot where he was
shot. And there's no expert testimony to refute that.
So how do you get past there being a
reasonable probability of a different verdict when there
is nothing to refute the critical testimony at issue,
that Klein was shot where he was shot because there's
high-velocity blood splatter in front of him and because
the pooling on his face shows that?
MR. GARDNER: Let's take both the
high-velocity blood spatter and the pooling, Your Honor,
but let me start with the predicate. And you are right,
Detective Bell did not testify at all about the
formation of the blood pool, and that's why this case
isn't about anticipating a State's expert about the
blood pool, but about getting your own for your own
case.
But turning to the specifics of your
question, the high-velocity blood spatter. It actually
wasn't in front of the couch, Your Honor. It was to the
side and below the arm. And let's remember Detective
Bell's testimony about how the homicide occurred,
because the State's theory was not that Pat Klein was
shot while he was lying on the couch, but that he was
sitting on the couch.
And so what's -- what's most interesting
about the high-velocity blood spatter, since he's shot
in the head, is that there is none on the wall
immediately behind the couch. This was a matter of some
confusion in the briefs as well, but I think it's been
cleared up. There's no high-velocity blood spatter
behind, on the pristine white wall.
So the question is: If he's shot while
sitting up, the high-velocity blood spatter that Bell
testifies to travels, oh, about 4 feet over the couch,
and then two drops sink down. Now, in terms of the jury
evaluating that testimony, it's important to note that
Detective Bell gave a description of what high-velocity
blood spatter is, and he said it's a fan-like pattern of
atomized blood. And when you look at these two drops,
these two drops alone that travel 4 feet and then drop
straight down to fall on a plastic bag, you see, as
defense counsel pointed out in his closing argument,
that they are the same size as blood drops found in the
kitchen on Exhibits R18 to R22.
And Detective Bell's entire theory for why
these were high-velocity was their size. There was
never any dispute that there was no shooting in the
kitchen.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what other
expert evidence should Richter's counsel have pursued
before deciding upon his course of action in this case?
Put aside the blood-spatter expert. What
other experts did he need to consult?
MR. GARDNER: Putting aside the
blood-spatter issue -- and these were raised in the
lower court but not addressed -- there were -- he
promised the jury ballistics testimony as well, which he
didn't produce.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. We have got a
blood-spatter expert, a ballistics expert. Go on.
I thought, in their habeas proceeding, you
said he should have consulted a serologist and a
pathologist. Okay, that's four. Why wouldn't he have
wanted to talk to an expert on the effects of alcohol
and drugs on people's different perceptions of the
events?
MR. GARDNER: Well, I think the chief reason
is, is that that wasn't part of his theory. If you
look -- and really, the guide to this, Your Honor, is
defense counsel's own theory, because defense counsel
stands up in opening statement and he promises the jury
a theory. And the theory isn't you're going to hear two
stories, and you have to assess credibility.
His theory, as he explained to the jury, was
the physical evidence will show you Pat Klein was not
shot on the couch.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, he had not received
notice from the State that they were going to call any
experts, so why wasn't it reasonable for him to assume
they're not going to call any experts, they're not going
to be able to pull experts out of their pocket in the
midst of the trial, and the judge isn't going to allow
them to do that without providing a -- without granting
a recess? What seems to have happened here seems pretty
unusual.
MR. GARDNER: Well, if this case were about
anticipating the State's decision to call an expert, I
would agree, but it's not. And the reason it's not is
because we have an insight into what defense counsel's
theory of the case was before the State ever started its
case, Your Honor. I mean --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the Ninth
Circuit said that part of the ineffective assistance was
failing to consult an expert in planning his defense and
in preparing his defense, not simply responding to the
State's expert in the middle of trial.
MR. GARDNER: I agree, Your Honor, and if I
said something that sounded like I didn't, then I
misspoke. My point is that that's exactly the theory.
Once defense counsel decides on his defense -- in this
case, I think he picked the right defense. He told the
jury the physical evidence would prove Pat Klein wasn't
on the couch, and he could have done that.
But despite promising the jury that the
physical evidence would prove this, he never consulted
with someone. And once --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you explain the
blood pooling in the face for me? You talked about the
high-velocity, but --
MR. GARDNER: Yes, I did. I didn't get back
to that. Thank you, Your Honor.
The testimony was, of course, about the
blood pattern flow on the face. And when you read
Detective Bell's testimony carefully, that testimony has
nothing to do with where Pat Klein is shot. It has to
do with the angle of his face after he's shot. So if
he's shot on the bedroom -- in the bedroom doorway and
falls and that's the angle, the blood flow would be the
same. So it really -- the blood flow pattern really has
little to do with where he was shot, but just the angle
of his face.
And getting back to the blood spatter
itself, the blood pool itself, what's interesting in
this case now is that, even after all these years, the
State has never disputed the fact that the absence of
satellite drops means the State's theory is false.
Gunner Johnson could not have deposited that
blood, because there's no satellite drops, which means
it had to come from another source. The only other
source is Pat Klein.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did I understand you
-- I just want to step back to the prior answer.
You think what counsel did here would have
been effective assistance but for exactly what he said
in the opening statement?
MR. GARDNER: If -- I'm sorry. If the
question is, but for the opening statement, would we
still have this argument, yes, although it would be much
more difficult to establish what his theory was. The
opening statement doesn't change the Strickland
analysis. It simply gives us an insight, an easier path
into knowing what counsel's theory was, much like --
much like the case of Wiggins v. Smith, where the Court
looked at defense counsel's opening statement in the
penalty phase repeatedly to see what was his theory and
what didn't he do. And when there was a suggestion made
in Wiggins v. Smith that, in fact, counsel's theory was
something else, the Court said no, look at his opening
statement. We know what his theory was.
So it doesn't change the standard, but it
gives us a very keen insight into exactly what he was
thinking and when he was thinking it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gardner, what about
the argument that all this is beside the point because
the argument for prejudice is so weak, given all the
other evidence that Mr. Colombo referred to?
MR. GARDNER: Well, it will come as no
surprise to know that I disagree with that argument,
Your Honor, and -- and for a couple of reasons.
The -- the cases really came down to Gunner
Johnson v. Petitioner Richter. Who was the jury going
to believe? Even on the record that counsel has
described, the jury deliberated 14 hours. And remember,
that record included a surviving eyewitness, and if you
believe the surviving eyewitness, the case is over.
The jury deliberated over 14 hours, asking
for reinstruction twice and a rereading of testimony
three times. And I think there's good reason for that
pause.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, Johnson
had given so many inconsistent statements at the outset
that he was a weak prosecution witness.
MR. GARDNER: I -- I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me the defense
could have pinned a great deal of hope on that.
MR. GARDNER: Well, I think -- actually, I
agree with the predicate of the question, Your Honor,
and that is Johnson had given a number of stories. He'd
given four or five different stories. And after all, he
knew both Branscombe and Richter. When he first spoke
to the 9-1-1 people, they said: What happened? He
said: Five people came in and shot me. Then he said
four, then he said three. And when they said, Who, he
said: I don't know. So clearly Gunner Johnson was a
compromised witness, Your Honor.
But the fact that the State has a
compromised witness is not the reason not to research
the physical evidence and enhance your client's
credibility. It's more of a reason to do it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with the
ammunition back at Richter's home, that the -- the gun
safe is found there and the unlikely story about them
going -- having the zeal to clean up their workplace and
then coming back?
MR. GARDNER: Well, let me take them one at
a time, Your Honor. And in a sense, the ammo and the
gun safe, the answer is -- is very similar. All parties
agreed in this case that several weeks before the
incident, Gunner Johnson had stored all his belongings
at my client's house. And, so, the only dispute was had
the -- the gun safe included. And this is one of the
unusual features, is that the State's theory requires us
to believe that this happened so he could rob a gun safe
that had been at his house for weeks.
The question was had -- had the material,
the gun safe and the ammo -- who's was it and had it
been taken back to Gunner's house? The ammo is found in
a place with two other things. It's found with a scale
used for measuring drugs, and it's found with shotgun
ammunition.
Now, the record shows that Gunner Johnson
had a shotgun, and Gunner Johnson was a drug dealer. So
the defense theory, of course, is that this ammo wasn't
my client's. It was Gunner Johnson's and hadn't been
moved back. Similarly, as to the safe, there was
conflicting testimony as to whether the safe had ever
been moved back.
So, that really is the explanation. And
that, I think, is why the jury had such pause about this
case when it heard the case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean the case
against Gunner you've just described, would it have been
enough, and wouldn't that have justified counsel's
decision to focus on credibility rather than expert
physical evidence?
MR. GARDNER: I think not. And -- and --
and we know this again for two reasons. And let me
start by saying the fact is that when counsel was asked,
that wasn't the reason he gave. It's not as if he -- he
came to the depo and he said this was my tactical
reason, and so we can say, okay, that's a reasonable
tactical decision. That wasn't the decision -- reason
he gave.
When asked did you decide not to present or
why didn't you present this blood-spatter testimony, he
said I simply didn't know it was out there. And after
all, let's keep in mind this was only his second
trial -- his second murder trial. He didn't know what
was out there. So, he didn't make that tactical
decision. And that's the first reason.
The second reason, I think, is that -- and
almost every case that has ever addressed this -- and I
have cited most of them -- has come to the same
conclusion. When there is a credibility determination,
when a defense -- any defense lawyer worth his salt
knows that there's a credibility determination to be
made, the jury is going to believe either this story or
my client's story, it at least behooves you to
investigate to see if the physical evidence can support
your position. You can always make --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did -- did counsel
have to investigate the other aspects? I mean, we're
talking -- we're focusing on the scene where the
shooting took place. Did he have to consider experts
with respect to the bypass, where they threw the guns,
Richter's apartment, the vehicle that was used? One
thing counsel said is he thought about hiring a tire
expert because of the vehicle. He has to look at the
possibility of expert testimony affecting every aspect
of the various scenes that were pertinent in this claim?
MR. GARDNER: I don't believe so. And -- and
the reason, again, comes back to the same focus this
Court had in Wiggins, another failure-to-investigate
case. What we know is that counsel suggested to the --
told the jury in opening statement, this is about the
physical evidence. The physical evidence will show
this.
When counsel -- when it's clear that that's
counsel's position in a case, it's simply application of
the Strickland test. It's unreasonable for counsel not
to at least have investigated the physical evidence that
he told the jury would show that Klein wasn't on the
couch.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does -- what
happens -- I know you have an answer that that's not
this case, but what -- what happens if the defendant
tells his lawyer, look, I did it, I'm guilty? And the
lawyer decides that the best thing to do is try to pin
it on a guy whose nickname is Gunner?
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does -- does -- what
else is the lawyer supposed to do? He thinks no matter
what -- what physical evidence is found, it's got to cut
against his client because his client did it.
MR. GARDNER: Well, in a situation where --
where counsel's investigation will not be exposed to the
prosecutor, and -- and there was questions before about
how California procedure works. And, indeed, once you
decide to name -- to call a witness, you name him and he
becomes, you know, exposed through cross-examination and
for investigation. But at least in terms of your
private investigation of a case, the ABA standards are
fairly clear that even an admission of guilt doesn't
affect your ability or your obligation to investigate.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if -- if the expert
says that the pool of blood all belonged to -- I guess
it's Johnson, I certainly think ethically that you could
not argue otherwise to the jury?
MR. GARDNER: I think ethically you couldn't
argue otherwise to the jury.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So, that's a
reason why defense counsel in this case and, the Chief
Justice puts, in many cases prefers not to have experts,
just so they can punch holes in the State's case.
That's a -- that's a legitimate strategy. And this
counsel was very -- an adept cross-examiner. There's no
doubt about that.
MR. GARDNER: I -- I don't disagree, except
that again we come back to the -- the notion from
Wiggins, which is you can't defend a tactical judgment
that wasn't made. And, in fact, when counsel was asked,
is this the reason you did this, he said no. I didn't
call a blood-spatter expert because I didn't know it was
out there. I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I come back to your
response to the Chief Justice's question about counsel
who knows that his client is guilty, and you say the ABA
standards say that even when that's the case, you have
an obligation to get an expert witness to confirm that
the client is --
MR. GARDNER: I'm sorry. I thought -- I
thought the hypothetical was counsel's client has said
he was guilty, not that counsel knew he was guilty.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. GARDNER: The ABA standards say that the
duty to investigate, the broad duty to investigate on
defense counsel exists irrespective of the client's
statements to his lawyer.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We've never adopted the ABA
standards, have we?
MR. GARDNER: In that regard, no, you
haven't.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That standard seems to me
quite silly.
(Laughter.)
MR. GARDNER: I -- I -- you know, I can
understand that, Your Honor, but from practical
experience, I will tell you the fact that a client
admits to something doesn't mean he did it or she did
it. That's the real world consequence we face as
defense lawyers. Often our clients tell us things, and
you can't always believe them, whether they say they're
innocent or whether they say they're guilty.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm sure they often
say they're innocent when they're guilty, but I'm --
I'm -- I'm astounded that they often say they're guilty
when they're innocent.
MR. GARDNER: Well, you know, I would
suggest the false confession literature that has come
out, and there's plenty of it to show that, in fact,
that's not an infrequent occurrence.
JUSTICE SCALIA: To -- to the police,
perhaps, yes, but to his own counsel? I -- I'm -- I'm
not aware of any literature to that effect.
MR. GARDNER: In which case I'll come back
to the answer the Chief Justice suggested moments ago,
that that's not my case. It seems like a safe haven at
this point.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your
case -- your case does involve the AEDPA issue. Perhaps
you want to turn --
MR. GARDNER: It does, and so --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to that now.
MR. GARDNER: I was trying to use that as a
segue into that, Your Honor. Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It worked.
MR. GARDNER: It worked. That rarely
happens, Your Honor.
And let me turn then to the AEDPA issues in
this case, because on March 28, 2001, this California
Supreme Court denied the petition for writ of habeas
corpus in my client's case with an order that said the
petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied. That same
day in five other cases, noncapital cases, the
California Supreme Court denied the writ saying the
petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied on the
merits. And the State's position here today and in the
briefing is that the Federal court should simply ignore
that difference. And I don't believe that's the case
for several reasons.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is your answer to
the -- to -- to the representation that In re Robbins
settled that when the California Supreme Court says just
denied, it's on the merits?
MR. GARDNER: Well, actually I agree and I
disagree. In re Robbins does settle the matter from a
State law perspective, but not as the Attorney General
has suggested. In re Robbins says a few things.
First, it says that when we deny a case on
the merits, we add the phrase "on the merits."
Then it says that when we find a procedural
default, we cite to that default so that everyone knows.
And then it says -- and this was in response
to a question I think you asked, Justice Scalia -- they
say a third thing. They say sometimes we'll find both,
that it's meritless and it's defaulted, and we will say
both. We will cite a default, and we will say it's
denied on the merits as well, trusting that the Federal
courts will give deference to --
JUSTICE BREYER: But what they cite it for,
actually, is they make a slightly different argument in
their brief. They say going back to 1974, there are at
least three cases in the Ninth Circuit that have said
when the California Supreme Court says nothing, just
denied, we take that as a decision to reach the Federal
issue and deny it on the merits.
Now, not in your case, but in most cases
that will benefit a defendant, because it will avoid the
question of whether there's an adequate and independent
State ground of a procedural nature. So, what they're
saying is that that's the Ninth Circuit's statement in
three cases, and the California Supreme Court over a
course of 30 years has never said to the contrary, which
it had plenty of opportunity to do, and in other
instances where the Ninth Circuit was wrong, it did do
So, that, I think, is a fairly strong
argument. Now, you're going to -- the only reason that
you're not out of court on your own interpretation is
because you'll say that the State waived the procedural
issue. And then they'll come back and say so did you.
So, what -- what is your response to all
that?
MR. GARDNER: Well, I -- there's a whole
bunch there, so let me see if I can -- if I can tease it
out. It is true that the Ninth Circuit has had this
process, this procedure for a long time, and, of course,
it developed in a pre-AEDPA world, when the fact whether
something was on the merits or not didn't really matter.
The only question was, Was it defaulted? And if it was
defaulted, it might bar Federal review. Whether it was
on the merits was really irrelevant because, before
2254(d), that really didn't matter.
So that's where -- and I agree with the
State -- that's where those cases come from. I don't
believe, however, that the waiver argument is really
implicated here, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, look, for example, in
Hunter v. Aispuro -- they quote it as saying the
following: The California Supreme Court's denial of a
State habeas petition, quote, "without comment or
citation constitutes, a decision on the merits of the
Federal claims." End quote. And then they have three
other cases roughly to the same effect.
Now, what you're saying is that this Court
should hold to the contrary, and by the way, in doing
that, we will bar many Federal habeas petitioners from
the Federal courts, because what it will mean is that
there is an adequate and independent State ground in
case after case, which perhaps is an irrelevant feature.
But, nonetheless, the silence of the California Supreme
Court is significant, I think, when faced with those
pretty clear interpretations of what their silence means
by the Ninth Circuit.
MR. GARDNER: Yes. And actually if the
Ninth Circuit were the only voice in the fray, Your
Honor, I think the argument would be stronger, but the
Ninth Circuit's voice isn't the only voice in the fray,
and that brings me to Ylst. In Ylst, of course, the
Ninth -- and Ylst v. Nunnemaker is a case which is part
and parcel of this history from the Ninth Circuit of
saying silent denial is on the merits.
In Ylst v. Nunnemaker that's exactly what
the Ninth Circuit said. And it came to this Court, and
the State actually argued that it wasn't on the merits.
And, indeed, this Court held that you cannot tell from a
silent denial whether it's on the merits or not. That's
the first response, Your Honor, is that there are
additional voices other than the Ninth Circuit. The
second is that well after Hunter v. Aispuro comes the
Robbins footnote and in the Robbins footnote --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm having a very hard
time with your reliance on that footnote because the
very last paragraph of that footnote says when
Respondent's asserts -- and I'm shortening the
introductory line -- a State procedural bar and when
nevertheless our order disposing of a habeas corpus
position does not impose the proposed bar or bars as to
that claim, that signifies that we have considered
Respondent's assertion and have determined that the
claim or subclaim is not barred on the procedural
ground.
MR. GARDNER: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the footnote itself
says unless we invoke the procedural bar, we're not
applying it.
MR. GARDNER: I think that's right, Your
Honor, but that's not the only thing the footnote says.
The footnote says when we deny on the merits, we say on
the merits; when we cite a procedural bar, we mean a
bar; and if the State has raised a bar, as they did
here, and we don't rely on it, that means we haven't
relied on the procedural bar.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.
MR. GARDNER: When you put those together,
what it means is there was no majority for a decision on
the merits, otherwise they would have said on the
merits. There was no majority for a decision on
procedural default, otherwise they would have said
default. And that's what a silent denial means, and
that's exactly what this Court said in Ylst. You cannot
tell because there are seven judges, there are different
claims, there are different possibilities. That's why a
silent denial is there in State court. It's
precisely --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. There --
there's no majority for either ground, and yet you find
in favor of the State? How can that be?
MR. GARDNER: Well, I -- you say either
ground. There are -- there are multiple grounds for
procedural default, Your Honor, under State law. There
are many possible procedural defaults.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you're -- you're
positing that the only time they do not say either
procedurally barred or on the merits is when they don't
have a majority for either one?
MR. GARDNER: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How can they render a
decision in favor of the State, then, if there's no
majority for either disposition?
MR. GARDNER: The question is, Why
deliberate to a majority when they sit around the
conference, the seven judges -- let's say two judges
believe there's a procedural default of untimeliness.
Two judges think it's timely but think it should have
been raised below. Two judges think it's both timely
and it didn't need to be raised below, but it hasn't
been pled with sufficient specificity, and one judge
thinks it's improper on the merits. There's seven
judges; they all believe it should be denied, but
there's no majority for any position.
There's no reason for the California Supreme
Court -- and this is addressed more in the amicus brief
by the California Academy of Appellate Lawyers. There's
no reason for the California Supreme Court at that point
to spend a day, two days debating it when all seven
judges agree there's a reason to deny the petition.
JUSTICE ALITO: But under your example,
isn't there a majority for the proposition that there's
a procedural default, but disagreement as to the
particular procedural default?
MR. GARDNER: That could be. And -- and
what the California -- I'm sorry.
JUSTICE ALITO: If it's just a binary choice
between procedural default and merits, isn't there --
and everybody agrees it should be denied, then there's
going to be a majority for one or the other, right?
MR. GARDNER: That is true, and I have been
unclear and I apologize for that. It is not a binary
choice between default and merits; it's a choice between
which default and merits. And there are many defaults
under State law. When the court denies on timeliness
grounds, it will cite Clark. When the Court finds that
it has been pled with insufficient specificity, it will
cite Swain --
JUSTICE ALITO: Is there more than one
possible procedural problem here?
MR. GARDNER: Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO: I thought it was just
timeliness.
MR. GARDNER: Well, timeliness was the only
one raised by the State, but -- but to be sure, like
this Court, the California Supreme Court has never been
bound in terms of its procedural default findings by
what has been raised and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What others could apply
in this case?
MR. GARDNER: Well, at the risk of not
wanting to argue against my client, I could give you
some -- some that could apply that haven't been
suggested and, therefore, most certainly are waived.
But the California law often requires that you file your
habeas petition in a lower court first. Reviewing
courts often deny petitions for failure to file in a
lower court first.
There is a requirement that says you must
plead with sufficient specificity. That's often relied
on by reviewing courts. There is a requirement that
says you must attach all readily available documents.
That's another --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: With this confusion, your
version, your colleague's version, when the district
court -- the district court denied relief, did you ask
the district court, please certify this question of what
a silent denial means, certify it to the California
Supreme Court so we will have once and for all an answer
of what a silent denial means?
MR. GARDNER: The answer is no, I didn't
request certification. When we were in district court
and when we were in the Ninth Circuit, both sides
accepted the existing framework the Ninth Circuit had
established applies to a silent denial, but only under
-- only through the lens of independent review. The
Court's added question has put both of those at issue.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. GARDNER: Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Colombo, you
have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J. COLOMBO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COLOMBO: Thank you.
I think it's important to remember this is
an AEDPA case. It has always been an AEDPA case. We've
never asserted this case was not an AEDPA case. The
Court has had a very spirited discussion this morning
essentially conducting a de novo Strickland review of
the claims that are presented in the district court in
this case.
It's important to remember that we have to
view, as this Court described in Woodford v. Visciotti,
a Strickland claim through the lens of the applicant's
burden to demonstrate that the State court's resolution
of the Strickland claim on the facts of his case was
objectively unreasonable.
Whether this Court were to choose to find
that the California Supreme Court's determination, if it
were reviewed de novo, was improper is different from
determining whether or not the State court could have
reasonably concluded, on the factual record presented to
it, that the applicant's claim failed to -- to show a
basis for relief. That --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is it fair to say that this
-- in this case, that every party in the lower courts
assumed this was going to be a merits-related issue and
that some deference was due, and that nobody ever said
anything about it being a procedural issue where there
would be a procedural bar of some kind that was either
waived or not waived?
MR. COLOMBO: That's correct. The --
JUSTICE BREYER: The first time anybody
mentioned this procedural issue was when?
MR. COLOMBO: When Respondent's counsel
filed his brief in opposition in this Court.
JUSTICE BREYER: That was on the merits
brief in opposition?
MR. COLOMBO: That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: There was nothing before
that?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It wasn't part of the
cert -- the question -- we added the question.
MR. COLOMBO: Well, I would submit that if
there was a dispute about the applicability of AEDPA
deference to the California Supreme Court's summary
denial in this case, it should have been raised much
earlier than when we got to this Court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. I'm saying they
didn't raise it to start with; we added the question.
MR. COLOMBO: Yes, that's true.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it wasn't as if they
were trying to get around their own waiver?
MR. COLOMBO: No, I wouldn't suggest that
Respondent's counsel was avoiding that. I'm suggesting
that if this was a legitimately disputed question, it
could have been addressed much earlier.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You've lost me.
I thought you said -- I thought you said that they
raised it in the brief in opposition to the petition for
cert?
MR. COLOMBO: No, it was not raised in the
opposition to cert. It was not raised -- it was not
presented until the merits brief --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Until the merits brief in
opposition?
MR. COLOMBO: Yes. I wanted, if I may, just
touch a couple of points real quickly. On page 23 in
footnote -- I believe it's 6 of our reply brief, there's
a discussion about what the detective's testimony was in
regard to this blood spatter near the couch where the --
where the murder victim's body was found. I think it's
important to remember Respondent's counsel talked about
whether or not this spatter would have been consistent
with having been shot on the couch if there were blood
spatter behind the armrest.
What the detective testified to and what's
described in our brief is the detective said because
this was not a through-and-through exit wound -- that
is, the bullet lodged in the victim's head -- that the
spatter would have been what he described as back
spatter, meaning the blood would have flown out from the
victim's head outward, and that was consistent with what
the evidence was at the crime scene that the detective
observed when he was there after the murder was
committed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the drops
between the blood pool and the couch?
MR. COLOMBO: The detective described those
as essentially insignificant, that they didn't reflect
anything other than that someone was moving around in
the house, which was consistent with what the crime
scene investigators had discovered when they first
responded to the 9-1-1 call from the -- Mr. Johnson to
the police.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any reason not to
do this? I'm just thinking from our point of view -- I
mean, I think it's probably correct what you say:
Nobody mentioned a word about this procedural issue
until the brief in opposition on the merits, not the
cert brief. And the reason they did was perfectly
legitimate: We'd asked the question.
Well, if we were wrong to do that, could --
and if we took the opinion as being a question of
reasonable deference, et cetera, and went into it, is
there anything -- any reason not to put in that opinion
somewhere, given Ylst and given the Ninth Circuit, it
would be helpful if the California Supreme Court, for
future reference, explained what their practice does in
fact mean, whether it's procedural or whether it's on
the merits?
MR. COLOMBO: I would submit that that would
be helpful but unnecessary.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,
counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon at 11:05 a.m., the case in the
