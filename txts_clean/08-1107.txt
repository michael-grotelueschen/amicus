ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. SRINIVASAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The diversity statute deems a corporation a
citizen of, quote, "the State where it has its principal
place of business," closed quote. The Ninth Circuit
erred in holding that Petitioner Hertz is a citizen of
California, even though Hertz is headquartered in New
Jersey and conducts over 80 percent of its operations
outside the State of California, and even though, under
the court's approach, national corporations could
regularly be deemed California citizens if they conduct
operations in that State that are proportional to the
State's population.
The better reading of the statute, in our
view, is that it points to the location of the
corporation's headquarters, the site from which a
corporation directs and controls all the company's
operations throughout all of its locations. And that is
particularly the correct reading when the statutory
language is considered in light of two considerations.
First, the strong preference for simplicity
and ease of administration in jurisdictional rules; and
second, Congress's purposes in 1958 to preserve
diversity jurisdiction for corporations in 48 States and
to deny access to diversity jurisdiction only in one
State, the State where the corporation had its home or
principal place of business.
Now, with respect to the ordinary meaning of
the statutory text, the critical phrase is "principal
place of business." And dictionary definitions of that
term define the term "principal place of business" as
corporate headquarters, and that is fortified by Federal
and State laws, which also define the term as "company's
headquarters" --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the problem
with every test is that you can find an exception that
makes the application ridiculous.
Let's assume that we accept that
headquarters or nerve center may have some applicability
to a corporation that has a business in a variety of
different States.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That's --
your situation is perhaps the most attractive --
MR. SRINIVASAN: Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because whether
California has 20 percent and Florida 14 or 15 percent,
to me the differences are not terribly substantial. I
can imagine McDonald's having 1 percent in every part of
the world, and how do you choose then? California would
say, then you -- you go back to headquarters. But I
don't know why you start there.
But let's posit the simpler situation.
Headquarters in New Jersey, but everything else is in
California. Your test would ignore completely that --
and it depends on how you define "headquarters." If
they have three corporate executives, that's the entire
extent -- or let's say one corporate executive who
started the company and who lives in New Jersey, and he
flies out to California half the time and runs the
business from there but happens to live in New Jersey.
Then you would say diversity is still New Jersey,
correct?
MR. SRINIVASAN: We would, Your Honor. But
let me -- let me start first with accepting Your Honor's
premise, that in the situation of a multistate
corporation with -- with diverse operations, the
principal place of business would be the headquarters.
Now, I take your point that there are
situations in which the test may not seem so
straightforward, but we think even in the -- the
hypothetical that Your Honor posits, the better
answer -- at least our first submission would be, the
better answer is the headquarters would control. And
that's for a couple of reasons.
Although, again, the one exception that we
would have to our rule is exactly Your Honor's
hypothetical, and let me just bracket that. Now, the
reason we think, first and foremost --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you have not
articulated a -- at least to me, a meaningful principle
in which to set that exception. It has to be tied
somehow to the test and why the test in some situations
would have applicability and others may not.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. And let me -- let
me --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because I don't know the
difference between one headquarters and two places to do
business or three, but I can still see that some
factoring has to be done when the places of business are
more limited.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I -- well, we think
first and foremost that the headquarters' role would
apply even in Your Honor's situation, and I will get to
that to the exception -- fashioning the exception in
just one second --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your case doesn't
call for that judgment, because you have a multistate
corporation, and it -- I assume you would be satisfied
with saying that when a corporation has dispersed
operations, it doesn't have its business center or its
headquarters -- doesn't have its business center
dominant in any one State, that it's dispersed, then you
take the headquarters, because there's no way to pick
among -- choose all the others, and it certainly isn't
worth the labor to try to do that.
So you could have a rule that says,
dispersed across many States, you pick headquarters.
And that -- you don't have to urge anything further.
MR. SRINIVASAN: No, absolutely, Justice
Ginsburg. And we would certainly accept the resolution
of the case in -- in that light.
If the Court were to announce a rule that
says, multistate corporations with diverse operations,
the principal place of business in that situation is the
headquarters, I think Your Honor is correct that
certainly we would prevail under that and that would be
entirely acceptable to us. But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why would we say
that? Just because it wins your case and it solves your
problem? I mean, it seems to me, to do that, you
abandon your principal argument, which that -- which is
that "place" doesn't mean "State."
MR. SRINIVASAN: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And to talk about the whole
State of California as the principal place of doing
business -- I mean, if Congress meant that, it would
have said, the principal State in which business is
done.
MR. SRINIVASAN: That's -- that's correct,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want to throw
away that good argument, do you?
(Laughter.)
MR. SRINIVASAN: We certainly don't want to
throw it away. We certainly don't want -- first and
foremost, we would like to prevail. And I think even
under the narrow approach --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would never get to
California's thing about State. If you say multistate,
you pick the place. The headquarters is the place, it's
within a State.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. And -- and that's why
we would accept that result, Justice Ginsburg. We
certainly would. Let me just put that out there first
and foremost.
Now, with respect to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were you done with
your -- were you done with your answer to Justice
Sotomayor's hypothetical?
MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know that I, in
fact, started the answer, Mr. Chief Justice --
(Laughter.)
MR. SRINIVASAN: -- with respect.
The answer is that even in that situation,
for the reasons that Justice Scalia highlights, we would
say that the headquarters controls. And let me give two
-- two principal reasons why.
The first is that even if the operations are
in one State and the headquarters are in a different
State, the headquarters still is where the direction and
control comes from. And I think the ordinary meaning of
the phrase "principal place of business" in that
situation would still direct attention to the
headquarters.
And the dictionary definitions that we
identified in -- in our brief and every Federal and
State law that defines the term "principal place of
business" defines it at headquarters -- as headquarters,
without any exception for the hypothetical situation
that Your Honor posits. But the other --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what constitutes
headquarters?
MR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many executives have
to live there? What else has to exist there? And then
what is the default rule if those things don't exist?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. Your Honor, I think
-- and that -- that is the sort of different set of
questions which is other ambiguities with respect to the
definition of a headquarters in certain situations.
Now, by and large, the headquarters is
relatively straightforward. It's made in public filings
which are an easy place to look, and if you look at the
experience of the Seventh Circuit, which of course has
applied the headquarters approach across the board over
the course of several decades, I think we can see that
that test has been straightforward and it is simple in
application, in the main.
Now, that is not to say that there are not
issues about the definition of headquarters at the outer
perimeters. There are. And I think the place I would
look first and foremost is: Where does direction and
control for the corporation come from? That is the
situs at which the headquarters would be found.
And I would look also to what a corporation
itself identifies as headquarters in public filings. In
-K filings and under the Model Business Corporations
Act, corporations have to report their headquarters in
annual reports. And of course they are doing those
reports for other reasons other than establishing
jurisdiction in a particular case, so I think they come
with an air of objectivity about them. That's where I
would look.
Now, I would make this other point, though,
about the ambiguity that Your Honor points to with
respect to the definition of a headquarters. That --
that is not at all an ambiguity that only applies to our
test, because under Respondent's test and under the test
of every court of appeals, they take into account the
headquarters.
Now, we would think that that is
dispositive. The other courts consider it at least
highly relevant, albeit not dispositive. But whatever
ambiguities --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why did the others all go
through some through total, totality of the factors
test? I mean, obviously, you could pick the
headquarters. You'd say Congress wanted one place;
headquarters is a logical choice, end of -- but most
circuits have made it more complicated than that. The
Seventh Circuit is the only one who said, keep it
simple, as you urge -- headquarters.
Why are the other circuits resistant to the
solution that you are proposing.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, first in a situation
with a multistate corporation with dispersed operations,
as we point out in footnote 2 of our reply brief, I
think the courts of appeal are generally in agreement
that the headquarters would control in that situation.
Now, with respect to whether you would have
an across-the-board headquarters rule, Justice Ginsburg,
I think what happened is, the first court to consider
this question was the Third Circuit in the Scott case,
pretty soon after the statute was enacted in 1958. And
that court, with respect, didn't wrestle with the
ordinary meaning of the statutory terms, and it didn't
wrestle with the strong premium on simple and
administrable jurisdictional rules. And then that
doctrine sort of took on a life of its own, I think.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it -- they -- they
do it in different ways.
MR. SRINIVASAN: They do.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Some say business
operations, some say headquarters.
MR. SRINIVASAN: There -- there is a variety
of different approaches. I think all of them share the
common feature that they consider, essentially, a
totality of the circumstances. And all of them, in our
view, share a common flaw, which is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does -- how do the
bankruptcy courts do it? I mean, you brought out that
"principal place of business" was -- was a term that the
bankruptcy courts had been using before the amendment of
32, 1958. But I -- I don't think that the -- that it
is inevitably headquarters for the bankruptcy courts. I
mean, there's -- sometimes it is in other places, isn't
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the bankruptcy courts
-- I think the fairest assessment of the bankruptcy
courts as of 1958 was that it was a model.
Now, since then, the Collier's treatise, for
example, would tell you that the majority and
predominant rule is the headquarters rule, even in the
bankruptcy context. Pre-1958, I think there was a
conflict. That's what the treatises said and that's
what we explain in our brief. But there certainly were
some courts that adopted a headquarters approach, even
in the bankruptcy context.
But I think one thing I would caution the
Court about is assuming that just because some courts in
the bankruptcy context, because of bankruptcy-specific
considerations -- and a specific consideration was the
felt need to have the assets of the bankrupt estate
within the purview of the court so that the court could
administer the estate -- that Congress would have wanted
to import every judicial application down to every
nuanced detail in the bankruptcy context over to the
jurisdictional context, where we know that Congress
thought that simplicity was a real virtue.
And I think, as Your Honor's opinion in
Wachovia v. Schmidt a few terms ago points out, there is
no reason to assume that Congress would have taken one
word in the venue context and applied the exact same
meaning to that same word in the jurisdictional context.
And here, because of the strong preference -- excuse me
-- in favor of simplicity and administrability in
jurisdictional rules, that is a particularly poignant
reason why the headquarters approach, in our -- in our
point of view, should govern in all circumstances.
Now --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the case -- this is
purely hypothetical, but suppose Hertz were to be
bankrupt, file a petition in bankruptcy, where -- New
Jersey would be the place, on your -- or the assets are
dominantly someplace else, so it would be another place?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think, if -- if
what you are asking, Justice Ginsburg, is, where would
the principal place of business be under the bankruptcy
statute, the majority rule now, under the Fifth Circuit
case Commonwealth Oil Refining and the Seventh Circuit
case Peachtree, would show that the majority rule now is
that the principal place of business would be New
Jersey.
And one point I would like to get to in that
regard is the sort of oddity of saying that the -- the
principal place of business of a company like Hertz
would be somewhere other than New Jersey. The Ninth
Circuit has a view that the principal place of business
of Hertz is California, based on the fact that Hertz
conducts 20 percent of its business in California.
But it is important to bear in mind that
this statute is a zero-sum game. So that if Hertz is
deemed to have its principal place of business in
California, such that it is disabled from getting access
to diversity jurisdiction in California, the consequence
is that Hertz would be enabled to gain diversity
jurisdiction in every other State -- and I'm putting to
one side Delaware, the State of incorporation -- but it
would be enabled to gain access to -- to diversity
jurisdiction in every other State.
So the consequence would be that if Hertz
were sued in a State court action in Park Ridge, New
Jersey, the site of its headquarters, Hertz could get
Federal court jurisdiction in that jurisdiction on the
theory that it's an out-of-State company, it's a
California company, because it performs 20 percent of
its business in California.
Now that -- the oddity of that, in our view,
is particularly poignant if one takes into account a
company like Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is universally
recognized to be an Arkansas corporation because it is
headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, but Wal-Mart
also, it's undisputed, does substantially more business
by any of the measures that the Ninth Circuit considers
significant in Texas. It has more employees there; it
has more stores there; it generates more revenues there,
by a significant factor well in excess of 50 percent
over and above any other State.
But the consequence of deeming Wal-Mart a
Texas corporation based on the amount of business it
does in Texas would be not only that Wal-Mart would be
disabled from getting Federal court jurisdiction in
Texas, but that Wal-Mart would be enabled to get Federal
court jurisdiction in Bentonville, Arkansas, on the
theory that even in Arkansas, Wal-Mart would be an
out-of-State corporation, a Texas corporation, because
of the level of business that it conducts in Texas.
And we don't think that is the result that
Congress would have envisioned in 1958 when it enacted
the Principal Place of Business provision. Instead,
what Congress presumably had in mind is that
corporations, as a general matter, are identified with
the location of their headquarters.
So in the Wal-Mart situation, Wal-Mart
rightly is universally acknowledged to be an Arkansas
corporation because of the presence in that State of its
headquarters.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all you are
talking about is not necessarily nerve center, because
in reading the examples in your brief, what you are
talking about is: Where is the place where they have
the most important, significant, influential contact?
Now, the Ninth Circuit has defined that as
the place where business is done; you are suggesting
that it's the place where the nerve center is. But it
goes back to begging my question: Why -- just simply
their declaring it on a tax form doesn't make it
important, influential, or significant contact. There
has to be something more to the test, and it can't be
just what I declare my headquarters to be. There has to
be some form of activity in that place.
MR. SRINIVASAN: There does, Your Honor, and
we think -- I guess the -- the comparison I would make
is to an individual, because an individual can't declare
that he or she is a domiciliary of a particular State
and have it be so for citizenship purposes. There has
to be something behind that, and so too with
corporations.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- that's the
point.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Exactly, and we -- we share
that view. A corporation couldn't simply declare that
its headquarters are located in a -- in a location where
it has a mailbox, for example, and have that be
dispositive for citizenship purposes. What --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there -- is there
something to a rule that says headquarters is
presumptively the nerve center, but a challenged party,
whoever that is, can rebut it?
MR. SRINIVASAN: I think certainly it would
be a vast improvement over what the Ninth Circuit has.
So I would say that as a starting point, Your Honor. I
think -- in our view, of course, a principal submission
is the headquarters controls in all -- in all
situations, and the cost of having, you know, a
rebuttable presumption would be: What does it take to
rebut it? That would be question. And I think--
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the point
that I raised, which is that the headquarters is not an
important, consequential, or substantial. You can rebut
it if you can show that it is a shell headquarters.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. And I think in that
situation, I guess -- I guess there is two different
ways that one could look at that. One is to say that
you could rebut it, but the other is to say that it is
not the headquarters.
And I guess that's the way that I would look
at it, is to say that if the corporation identifies a
location at which it in fact doesn't direct and control
the operations of the corporation throughout, it
wouldn't constitute the headquarters.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but --
MR. SRINIVASAN: So I guess that's where I
would place the load-bearing weight. It may be
semantic, but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the problem,
which is, the party comes in, alleges by summary
judgment that -- in a summary judgment motion: This is
my corporate headquarters. The other side's going to
have to come forth with evidence that shows something.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. And if -- and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that it's always a
rebuttable presumption.
MR. SRINIVASAN: There is, Your Honor, and
if the other side were able to show that the location
that the party identifies as -- as its headquarters does
not, in fact, function as a headquarters, in the sense
that suppose there is no executives there, or suppose
that the officials that are there in fact don't direct
and control the company's operations in other locations.
Well, then, that -- that would be a real issue.
But there are checks against that, because
corporations identify their headquarters in other public
filings, and in the main, those headquarters are the
locations in -- from which the chief executives direct
and control the companies' operations --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I actually do not know
whether public filings define what "headquarters" mean.
Is there a -- I know you have said it in your brief, but
what I didn't know is whether those public filings
define the activity necessary to designate a place as
"headquarters."
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, they -- they do in
the following sense, Your Honor. For example, with the
-K report for publicly traded companies, I think the
question that is asked is not the location of the
headquarters but the location of the principal executive
offices. And so I think, by definition, in answering
that question the principal executives would be located
at that -- at that location. Now, if they weren't, we
would certainly take Your Honor's point that there could
be a back-and-forth about that, but that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know, but didn't
Congress pick "a principal place of business"? And we
know that they looked at the bankruptcy courts. There
are lots of expressions in other statutes. Some say
"headquarters." Some say -- well, there are a variety
of things, but Congress picked this particular term,
"principal place of business."
And I was thinking, when you gave the
example of Texas, that the idea of diversity is you are
not going to get a Federal forum where you are at home.
And so one would think, well, if Wal-Mart is doing so
much in Texas, it's really no stranger in Texas. Why
shouldn't there be diversity in Texas?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, in -- in response to
the latter point, Your Honor, I think the one thing we
do know from 1958 is that Congress didn't think that a
corporation should be disabled from getting diversity
jurisdiction anywhere where it does a substantial
business, because it had that proposal before it, and it
rejected it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It rejected it, yes.
MR. SRINIVASAN: It instead chose an
approach whereby a company is disabled from getting
diversity jurisdiction in one, and only one,
jurisdiction, the jurisdiction in which it has its
principal place of business.
And I think what Congress had in mind is
that corporations, as a general matter, are identified
with their headquarters. And that is why Wal-Mart, for
example, is universally recognized as an Arkansas
company. It may be that Wal-Mart does substantial
business in Texas, substantially in excess of other
States, but Wal-Mart also does substantial business in a
variety of jurisdictions. But Congress decidedly didn't
have the rule that says wherever Wal-Mart does a
substantial business and is a well recognized company,
it should be disabled from getting to Federal court. It
limited it to one jurisdiction.
And we think the best reading of the phrase
"principal place of business" is the situs of the
headquarters in that there were -- with -- with respect
to the bankruptcy decisions, Your Honor, there -- there
were bankruptcy courts that did have a "headquarters"
approach. And, in fact, the one bankruptcy court of
which I am aware that looked at the meaning of the
ordinary language -- we cite the -- the relevant -- the
portion of the court's opinion at page 50 of our opening
brief in footnote 5. It is the First Circuit's opinion
in the Burdick case.
And what the First Circuit said was that a
corporation's, quote, "principal office," rather than a
factory, mill or mine, according to ordinary
understanding and speech, constitutes the principal
place of business within the meaning of the Bankruptcy
Code."
And so even before 1958, I think there was
definitely a sense out there that the term "principal
place of business" does mean headquarters. And this
gets to Your Honor's other question which is: If
Congress really meant "headquarters," why wouldn't they
have used the term "headquarters" instead of "principal
place of business"?
And I think our answer to that, with respect
to Your Honor, is that "principal place of business" is
an alternative formulation for "headquarters." And so I
don't think one can glean too much from the fact that
Congress chose "principal place of business" rather than
"headquarters" when "principal place of business" in our
view is a reference to the headquarters.
And this Court's opinion last term in the
Oswell Harlow versus United States case is a good
example of that, because there the statute that was at
issue used the term "facilitate" rather than the term
"aid or abet." And one could have readily made the
argument that because the statute uses the term
"facilitate" rather than "aid or abet," that normal
principles that accompany aiding and abetting liability
shouldn't apply in the statute. But the Court rightly
in our view reached the contrary conclusion, and it was
based on the notion that the term "facilitate,"
according to Black's Law Dictionary, means the very same
thing as "aid or abet." And once you cross that bridge,
then you can apply aiding or abetting principles to the
term "facilitate."
And here, likewise, the term "principal
place of business," according to Black's Law Dictionary,
means "headquarters." That's how Black's Law Dictionary
defines the term. And so the fact that Congress chose
one alternate formulation versus another, I don't think
speaks too loudly to the question of --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about her argument
that -- that Hertz has this New Jersey headquarters, but
its reservation center is in Oklahoma?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure, and -- and, again, I
would look at the public filings. In the public filings
in the 10-K, for example, Hertz universally identifies
its headquarters as Park Ridge, New Jersey. And the
reason is that the chief executive officials are all
located in Park Ridge.
Now, there is a large administrative
apparatus in Oklahoma City, and, according to the
affidavit, its administrative activities are performed
in Oklahoma City to a lesser extent. And that is at
paragraph 11 of the affidavit, which is at pages 29a to
a of the appendix to the petition.
But I don't think there is any real dispute
that Hertz's main headquarters are located in Park Ridge
rather than Oklahoma City. In point of fact, what you
have in Oklahoma City -- and -- and this isn't spelled
out in the -- in the affidavit, but what you have in
Oklahoma City is essentially the rental call center and
plus principal back-office duties like information
technology support. But what you have in Park Ridge is
all of the company's chief executives. So the decision-
making locus for the company's most important decisions
is absolutely in Park Ridge, New Jersey, rather than
Oklahoma City. And there is no dispute on the point
that is before the Court.
This Court comes -- this case comes to the
Court on the assumption that Hertz's headquarters are
located in Park Ridge. The question for the Court is
whether that headquarters location should be dispositive
for purposes of defining a company's principal place of
business.
Now, if I could -- if I could turn for one
moment to the cost in terms of simplicity and
demonstrability of an alternative formulation if the
Court were to accommodate a formulation that didn't look
to the headquarters, we see three potential categories
of costs that are brought about by the -- the proposed
approach of Respondents in what the Ninth Circuit has
established.
The first is the one that underlies the
strong preference in favor of simple, demonstrable,
jurisdictional rules. And that is just the time and
resources that would be invested at the threshold
jurisdictional stage in defining whether the case is --
is before the proper court. That in itself is reason
enough, in our view --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Not all diversity suits
have major law firms in them and a lot of resources to
spend in -- in discovery to determine more complex
tests.
MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. Yes, that's
our point, Justice Kennedy, and I think a "headquarters"
test is simple and straightforward in that respect, and
a "totality of circumstances" approach isn't.  But there
is also two additional costs that I would point out
about a "totality of circumstances" approach.
One is that you can have the very real
possibility because of the indeterminacy in that
approach that different courts would reach divergent
conclusions about the citizenship of the very same
corporation. And as we point out on page 40 of our
brief, that has already happened. Two district courts
in the Ninth Circuit alone in two California courts
reached divergent conclusions on the citizenship of
United Airlines. One court concluded that United was an
Illinois citizen, and another court concluded that
United was a California citizen. And that is not
altogether surprising that you would have those sorts of
divergent conclusions given the open-ended nature of the
"totality of circumstances" approach.
The third cost that I would point to is the
possibility that because of the indeterminacy in the
approach you could have a situation in which a district
court finds there is jurisdiction, proceeds to have a
trial on the merits and renders -- renders judgment on
the merits, and then several years later the court of
appeals would reverse the judgment because the district
court had gotten the jurisdictional input wrong at the
outset. And, again, that also, as with the situation
with divergent conclusions on the citizenship of the
same corporation, is not just a problem of theory. It
has actually happened.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- even when the
direct -- the -- even subject-matter jurisdiction is
precluded after final -- final judgment after direct --
so that's nothing new. It is the same example you gave.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think -- I guess my
point is that precisely because subject-matter
jurisdiction can be raised at any point --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not any point in the
direct -- up to denial of cert on direct review. After
that it's precluded, even subject-matter jurisdiction.
You can't collaterally attack on that basis.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure, right. I guess what
my point is that you could have a situation where a
trial court has reached a resolution on the merits.
Several years -- several years later the court of
appeals on direct review would reach the conclusion that
the district court got it wrong on subject-matter
jurisdiction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. SRINIVASAN: And there is a case that we
cite in our brief, the Diaz -- Diaz versus Pep Boys
case, that involve that situation.
If the Court has no further questions, I
would like to reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Schneider?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD M. SCHNEIDER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SCHNEIDER: Thank you. Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
For 50 years every circuit save the -- save
the Seventh had agreed -- has agreed on one overriding
principle: That courts must perform a balancing in
determining the principal place of business of a
corporation, and that balancing must include a
determination of where the corporation's people and
property are.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is -- is that a fair
description of what the Ninth Circuit did here? Did
they perform a balancing, or did they look solely to
where most of the sales were?
MR. SCHNEIDER: The -- the Ninth Circuit
specifically in this case noted that 43 percent more
employees for Hertz are in California, 75 percent more
property, 60 percent more revenue, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: More than -- more than
what, more than any other single State?
MR. SCHNEIDER: That's correct, Justice
Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't say the --
the "principal State of business." It's the "principal
place of business." Is there a difference between the
two?
MR. SCHNEIDER: I think I have two answers
to that, Your Honor. The first answer is that Congress
was using a term of art that was imported from the
Bankruptcy Code.
In all of the Bankruptcy Code cases prior to
58, the 11 USC 11 cases take an aggregation approach
when they look at it State-by-State, so, if we raise
principal place of business as a term of art that
Congress imported into this statute, then we have to
look at an aggregated State-by-State approach.
The other answer, I think, is more of a
semantic answer, which is how did Congress define the
word "place"? Certainly, the English language provides
that a place can be a building, as Hertz would have, or
a place could be a State, as we -- my place of birth,
for example, is New York State.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why -- why didn't they
say place of doing business? That's not the terminology
that they used.
MR. SCHNEIDER: They didn't, and Congress
was --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be more
consistent with an aggregation of -- of all of the
factors the Ninth Circuit starts with.
MR. SCHNEIDER: Your Honor, Congress chose
the phrase "principal place of business" because, to
quote the legislative history, there were many cases on
the books, and it was an easily understood phrase.
I think what Congress intended to do was to
not have us end up here, to take a phrase which was
known in the case law and to import it --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, what's very
clear from all of the articles I have read in the lower
court decisions is that Congress may have thought it was
picking a well-defined phrase, but, in fact, it wasn't,
that the Courts below are confused about what they were
doing before the statute.
So I don't know why importing the belief
that something was clear into a reality that it's not
helps us.
MR. SCHNEIDER: Your Honor, in answer to
Justice Scalia's question, I believe it was clear, from
all of the case law, that we were talking about place
equalling an aggregation of all of the activity in the
State.
With regard to your question, we have cited
in our brief two district court opinions that performed
a scholarly review of all of the case law at the time
that Congress passed the 1958 amendments. Particularly
of import is the Inland Rubber case.
And what the court found in the Inland
Rubber case is, while there was two lines of thinking,
there was the -- what came to be known as the nerve
center line of thinking and what came to be known as the
business reality line of thinking.
The nerve center test could almost all be
explained by the fact that, in those cases, the
corporation only had one place of business, there were
some outliers, but for the most part, the two judges, in
the Gilardi case and in the Inland Rubber case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why do you -- why do
you think that the circuits courts -- the vast majority
of them, the third, the first, the second, the fifth,
they all start with the proposition that, if a place has
far-flung businesses, then the nerve center test should
start the inquiry and control it more than in a
situation where there are lesser places of business?
MR. SCHNEIDER: Yes. That's the total
activities test, Your Honor, and the total activities
test would put initial weight on the nerve center, but
if one -- and then, of course, weigh whether or not
there is a substantial predominance of all of -- of all
of the other factors somewhere in the country, which,
frankly, is not a lot different than the Ninth Circuit
case -- test.
The Ninth Circuit simply does it in the
other way. It asks --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's a big
difference.
MR. SCHNEIDER: It asks the same question,
whether or not there is a -- a substantial
predominance -- finds substantial predominance, not just
predominance, but substantial predominance.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- you know, to me,
the word "substantial" usually means closer to 50
percent. I'm having a hard time understanding what the
appreciable difference is between 20 percent and 14 and
the balance being spread over so many other places.
What -- that seems very arbitrary in terms
of the place that generates the most money. That's it.
That's the place you are at home.
MR. SCHNEIDER: I think, to understand it,
one must look at the purpose of diversity. The real
question is, is diversity to be used as a sword by a
corporation, such that a corporation can choose its
place of diversity jurisdiction, or is it a shield to
protect the corporation, a truly foreign corporation,
from local bias?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's what --
but that goes back to the point, if we are talking about
shields or swords, Congress had before it a provision
that would say, anywhere you do business, you are not a
foreigner, because you are there. The people are going
to perceive you as a business -- the local business that
is doing business in that location, and Congress
rejected that.
So foreign has to have a meaning that was
somewhat different. And you don't think the corporate
headquarters where management is, where the direction
for the operation of the business is coming from, is the
place that needs the most protection in this system
because they are the ones making the decisions, and so
aren't they the ones who need to be protected from local
bias?
MR. SCHNEIDER: Courts have found that
corporations are best known where they have most of
their people and their property. That's because
employees go out in the community, property is bought
and sold in the community, so the local people will know
the corporation more where they have their people and
property than, necessarily, where they have the
headquarters.
Until this case began, I had no idea where
Hertz headquarters are. There is many corporations in
the State of California, that I have no idea are
headquartered in the State of California.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem with your --
your approach -- and California is unique in this
respect, is -- California is a very large State, lots of
business, and you are comparing to the next State that
has the next number of employees -- you know, Florida.
If I were entertaining your approach, I
would think, well, you would compare California against
the whole rest of the nation and not pick for a
dispersed -- a corporation that is widely dispersed.
California is going to be the big winner in
this. It's going to be able to keep all those cases in
its State court because so many multi-State
corporations, I imagine, would come out, just the way
Hertz does.
Am I right, that, under your analysis, the
one place where, if you say, we don't want Federal
courts to be dealing with corporations that are at home
in the State, but in the State of New Jersey, under your
view of things, a New Jersey citizen could sue Hertz in
Federal court in New Jersey, right?
MR. SCHNEIDER: That is correct, Your Honor,
unless, of course, Hertz were to change its place of
incorporation to New Jersey.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why do you say,
well -- why is it that the Ninth Circuit's method,
California versus Florida, instead of California and
let's see what the rest of the business is -- is, in the
whole United States?
MR. SCHNEIDER: I think the answer, Justice
Ginsburg, to that question goes back to how the phrase
"principal place of business" was looked at under the
Bankruptcy Code, and in the Bankruptcy Code, it was, in
fact, a State-by-State analysis, rather than a State
versus country analysis.
Now, Justice Ginsburg, you asked me, did it
mean that all corporations were going to end up being
California corporations? California -- the Ninth
Circuit has been doing it this way for 50 years. Every
other circuit has had -- save the seventh -- has had
some balancing test for 50 years, and it has not come to
pass that all corporations are California corporations.
A matter of fact, if you think of a
corporation that sells skis, they are likely going to be
a Colorado corporation, or they are going to be a Utah
corporation. A -- a corporation that sells mining
equipment is likely to end up in West Virginia or one of
the mining States.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand why,
somehow, a Californian is more likely to identify with
Hertz, simply because there are more Californians and,
hence, more Hertz outlets, than a New Jerseyite is
likely to identify with Hertz.
Per capita, there are probably as many Hertz
outlets in New Jersey as there are in California. The
only reason that you come up with California is it's an
enormous State. It has 10 percent of the population.
But as far as the citizens of the State
identifying with that -- with that company and,
therefore, the unfairness of -- of letting that
company -- you know, remove to Federal court, New Jersey
and California are absolutely the same.
MR. SCHNEIDER: Congress made a decision in
rejecting the any place where you are doing business
test, that it would not prevent corporations from
removing cases in any State where they are doing
business.
The question in diversity jurisdiction is
not whether or not a corporation should be allowed to
use the Federal forum to decide if that's the best forum
for it, but the question is a different one. Will there
be bias in the -- in the State court?
And because Hertz does so much business in
California, it's hard to argue that we bias by being in
the State court in California. Remember, this case --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they cannot be
advised by the State court in New Jersey either. The --
you correctly pointed out that Congress said place of
business. It didn't even do as it did with -- it didn't
do as it did with -- with corporate citizenship, that is
you could be a citizenship of as many States as you
incorporate in. But if it's got to be one place, so why
not just keep it simple and say presumptively it's the
business headquarters, in a particular case you could
show otherwise.
MR. SCHNEIDER: Congress had two goals,
Justice Ginsburg. The first goal was to prevent gaming
of the system. The simplest test is also the most
easily --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would be a phony
headquarters. But nobody is suggesting that -- that the
headquarters of Hertz in New Jersey, that that's a sham
set-up.
MR. SCHNEIDER: But even a -- even a real
headquarters wouldn't prevent gaming of the system.
If -- if a corporation truly wanted to stay out of State
court in a State where it was doing significant
business, even all of their business under Hertz' test,
they would only have to actually move their headquarters
out of that State.
There is a second reason that Congress
passed the '58 amendment --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that phenomenon? I
mean, I can see that as a hypothetical, but does it
happen in the real world, that a corporation moves its
headquarters in order to escape the Federal courts in a
particular State?
MR. SCHNEIDER: Because the test is only a
Seventh Circuit test, it wouldn't do any good for a
corporation --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it is one of the
factors in other -- in other states as well. It's part
of the totality of the circumstances. You certainly
increase your odds to move your headquarters.
MR. SCHNEIDER: It would, but it wouldn't be
dispositive. We do know that corporations move for all
sorts of economic reasons. They move for tax reasons,
they move because --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why would they move
simply to avoid a Federal court or to gain access to the
Federal court in a particular State?
MR. SCHNEIDER: There is -- as witnessed by
congressional findings in the Class Action Fairness Act,
there is a perception that State courts in certain
States are not good for corporations. Whether that --
that perception is a real perception or whether it's not
a real perception isn't before us today.
But if a corporation has all of its people
and all of its property and is doing all of its business
in one of those States, the corporation shouldn't be
allowed to game the system by simply moving its
headquarters, it's real headquarters out of that State.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we are not talking
about all. I mean, that would be -- that's why you make
it a presumption, the headquarters is a presumption
which could be rebutted. But you are not talking about
all business. You are talking about California where
there is a sizeable amount of business, simply because
it's the size of the State, the population of the State.
And I would understand your position better
if you would say, well, we would measure against the
entirety of the United States. But California is going
to come out the winner much more often than any other
State under this test simply because of its size.
MR. SCHNEIDER: With respect, Justice
Ginsburg, I don't believe that the case law has borne
that out. Again, I have read no studies that say
corporations are more often California citizens simply
because of the population of California -- that doesn't
mean that the study hasn't exist -- doesn't exist. I
simply haven't read it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't worry about
private individuals gaming the system, do we, by -- you
know, in -- in order to get into or out of Federal
court, establishing residence in a different State? We
don't worry about them gaming the system, do we?
MR. SCHNEIDER: We do, Justice Scalia.
There is a fact-intensive test for citizenship for
individuals based on their intent to stay in a place.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. But -- but you can
have a genuine intent to go somewhere else, and I don't
know that people do it for foreign reasons because they
want to get in or out of Federal court. You really
don't worry about that, it seems to me.
MR. SCHNEIDER: I do believe it is less
likely that an individual would either have the
sophistication or, frankly, the litigation volume to
make such a decision? But a corporation may, in fact.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I know some rich
individuals that might have the incentive.
MR. SCHNEIDER: I would like to turn, if I
may, to the second reason that Congress passed the '58
amendment and that was because of the notion of
overcrowding of the Federal docket because too many
diversity cases -- because there were too many diversity
cases because most litigation was happening far away
from the facts.
Suits involving corporations generally arise
where they have a lot of contacts with the public, where
there people are and where their property are. If we
allow a corporation to move all of its litigation where
the bulk of its people and property are to Federal
court, Congress's second goal --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Schneider, can I just
inject this thought? It goes back to Justice Kennedy's
question. I don't think we are concerned about the
defendants gaming the system. I think one other very
important concern is plaintiffs sometimes in small
communities want to sue somebody, and sometimes they
would much rather be in Federal court, because sometimes
the judges are better than the local judges, and so
forth. So there are a lot of reasons why plaintiffs
want to get into Federal courts.
And it seems to me it's important to have a
rule that makes it easy for the plaintiff to decide what
is the citizenship of the defendant, can I get into
Federal court or not. And I see it as a great argument
in favor of a very simple rule to benefit plaintiffs.
MR. SCHNEIDER: The -- again, for 50 years,
Justice Stevens, plaintiffs and plaintiffs' lawyers have
been able to under the various tests figure out where
corporations are citizens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But you must acknowledge
that it's a lot easier for a plaintiff -- there is some
place to get on the internet and say where is their
principal place and they get a simple answer. If you
get a question, well, I got to analyze their business
all over the country to decide, that's a formidable
obstacle for a -- for a plaintiff to overcome.
MR. SCHNEIDER: It may or may not be,
depending upon the corporation. The vast majority of
corporations are local corporations, so we are really
just talking about --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- of an interstate
business who are commonly defendants in a lot of
lawsuits -- in a personal injury suit, and the question
is, can I easily decide what the place of incorporation
of that defendant is.
MR. SCHNEIDER: That's correct, Justice
Stevens. And because most of those entities are public
corporations, there is a lot of information available in
FCC filings, et cetera, as to where they are actually
doing business. You can also simply look out your door
and figure out whether have I seen a lot of Hertz
outlets where I am.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is -- under
the Ninth Circuit test, where is -- what is the
principal place of business of Starbucks?
MR. SCHNEIDER: Under the Ninth Circuit
test, the principal place of Starbucks, there is a case
that says Starbucks is in California. Let me give you,
Mr. Chief Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a surprise.
(Laughter.)
MR. SCHNEIDER: I was -- I was surprised as
well. But -- but let me give you the numbers so that it
makes sense, because I have read the case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is -- where is its
headquarters.
MR. SCHNEIDER: Headquarters is in Seattle,
Washington. But over -- that's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the very first
little shop was there.
MR. SCHNEIDER: That's my understanding,
yes. However, over 100 percent more workers from
Starbucks are in California than Washington.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me what
0 percent means? Are the number of workers in Seattle
inconsequential? Is there one worker there or are we
talking about 1,000 in --
MR. SCHNEIDER: I don't know the total
numbers of the workers.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that important?
As Justice Scalia said that per capita California is
going to dwarf anybody anywhere if you are going to have
a multi-location place of business. So don't you have
to know the raw numbers?
MR. SCHNEIDER: I -- I don't know the raw
numbers from Starbucks, I'm sorry. I just read the
opinion. And what the opinion tells us is that
Starbucks has 10 percent of its employees in Washington
and 27 percent in California. Over 300 percent more of
its gross revenue comes from California than any other
State, 200 percent more of its retail stores are in
California than in any other State.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about, I guess,
mail order houses? I mean, what's the principal place
of business of Eddie Bauer?
MR. SCHNEIDER: It would -- it would be,
Your Honor, wherever there is a substantial predominance
of its people and property. I would assume -- and I
don't know the facts of Eddie Bauer, but I would assume
Eddie Bauer has a central location from which it does
its sales, which it does its factory work, where it is
shipping things from.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would -- would it
make a difference if, say -- it may well be the case, 30
percent of their business is in California?
MR. SCHNEIDER: No. But by business you
mean revenue, Your Honor?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.
MR. SCHNEIDER: The test we posit, Your
Honor, focuses on people and property. The test would
look first to the location of employees, tangible
properties and production activities, and then second to
income earned, purchases made and where sales take
place.
Mr. Chief Justice, did the Court have
interest in the jurisdictional argument?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I can only speak for
one member of the Court, and that one doesn't.
MR. SCHNEIDER: Okay. Then if the Court has
any questions about the -- our jurisdictional argument,
I would be happy to answer them. And without further
questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Srinivasan, you have four minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. SRI SRINIVASAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SRINIVASAN: Your Honor, just one point
and I will be brief.
The idea that corporations would switch
their -- location of their headquarters in order to
achieve jurisdictional results hasn't been borne out in
any example in which I'm aware. And there is a
fundamental reason why.
When a corporation decides to relocate its
headquarters, it's making a very important business
decision about what is the location from which its
direction and control is going to emanate. That is not
a gamesmanship decision.  That's a bona fide decision
about where its headquarters are going to be located and
where its most important decision -- business decisions
are going to be made.
If the Court has no further questions --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That means that its
principal officers and their families have to move.
MR. SRINIVASAN: It does.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the biggest
disincentive it seems to me.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.
If the Court has no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:56 a.m., the case in the
