CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 13-975, T-Mobile
South v. the City of Roswell, Georgia.
Mr. Fisher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Local governments violate the in-writing
requirement of Section 332 when they fail to issue a
document separate from the administrative record that
specifies the reasons for denying an application to
construct a personal wireless facility.  Any other
construction would flout the very purpose of this
provision, which is to enable meaningful judicial
review.  Indeed, allowing local governments to deny
applications without specifying their reasons would
require district courts across the country to embark --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not actually what
the court below said.  It said that it could discern the
reasons from the record.  That's a very different
statement than saying there are no reasons set forth.
MR. FISHER:  Justice Sotomayor, I'm not sure
the Eleventh Circuit did actually specify what the
reasons were.  It did pronounce that it believed that
the administrative record contained reasons.  We don't
deny that there are a bevy of potential reasons in the
district courts -- I'm sorry, in the administrative
record.  I counted nine or ten as I read the transcript
and the minutes.  The problem is we don't know which one
of those were the City's real reasons for denying the
permit, and therefore, we can't have the expedited
proceeding that Section 332 contemplates.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how far does your
argument go?  Suppose the -- suppose the instrument of
denial, the letter, does not list any reasons, but it
incorporates by reference or makes reference to some
other document that sets out the reasons.  Is that
sufficient?
MR. FISHER:  We think that if the denial
letter was clearly -- clearly directed us to some other
document and said -- and said where the reasons were,
and that document was contemporaneously available, we
think that would be enough.
Now, neither of those things are present
here.  There's no explicit reference to any particular
reasons in the minutes.  It just simply says the reasons
are available, and of course, as the Solicitor General
has pointed out, the minutes were not available.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Well, suppose
that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Just to follow up, I'm sorry
to interrupt.  Suppose the letter doesn't make a
specific reference to some other document, but there is
some other document known to the parties that has been
approved by the town council and sets out the reasons,
that would not be sufficient.  There has to be an
express reference in the instrument of denial.
MR. FISHER:  Right.  I think the question
is, what does the decision say?  That's the statutory
term.  And so, the decision needs to provide the
reasons.  Now, you could have a situation like the
Omnipoint case in the Sixth Circuit where instead of
getting a separate letter like we got in this case, you
get a resolution from the city council specifying the
reasons, and we think that would be enough as well.  All
we want to know is why -- why the application was denied
so that we can decide, first of all, whether to bring a
suit or try to negotiate with the local government.  And
second of all --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, that's not --
I'm sorry, go ahead.
MR. FISHER:  And second of all, so the
district court can do the streamlined work that Section
332 contemplates.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's not all
you want.  Let's say on Monday you get a letter that
says your application is denied.  And on Friday the city
council says the reasons we denied the application were
because of this, this, and this.  Is that enough for
you?
MR. FISHER:  No, it would not be enough --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.
MR. FISHER:  -- because the letter needs to
tell us why.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It doesn't matter
that four days or three days, whatever is later, there
is a resolution that doesn't say it's denied, it says
the reason we denied it is this.  That's not good
enough?
MR. FISHER:  Well, I think you'd have it in
a timing question, the Solicitor General frames, whether
that was substantially contemporaneous.  We think that
it --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know.
MR. FISHER:  -- needs to be in a single
document.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It has to be in a
single document.  What if it's stapled together?  You
know, here's one, it says denied.  And here's one
saying, the next day, the reasons we denied it is -- are
these.
MR. FISHER:  I think stapled together would
be just fine.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  What if
they're not stapled together?
MR. FISHER:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I
misunderstood.
(Laughter.)
MR. FISHER:  Make it easier for myself.  No,
we think that the statutory term is definition -- sorry,
is decision, is a singular.  So it needs to be put
together.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But decision -- decision,
Mr. Fisher, often means just denied.  There -- there is
one statute was mentioned in the brief at -- this is 47
U.S.C. 546 (c)(3), "The franchising authority shall
issue a written decision."  That's one sentence.  Next
sentence, "Such decision shall state the reasons
therefore."  So the requirement of a decision alone
doesn't necessitate that reasons be given.
MR. FISHER:  Justice Ginsburg, we think it's
fine to look at other provisions of the Communications
Act.  That one particular provision stands apart from
the several other provisions that the Chamber of
Commerce cited around page 10 of its brief and that we
cite in our brief where the word "decision" is used by
itself and in context clearly to mean a specification of
reasons.  Where the Communications Act contemplates no
statement of reasons, it uses words like "notify" or
"order."  And so we think it's perfectly fine to look at
the whole Act.  That one provision is the only
countervailing piece of evidence.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your bottom line is
because of this supposed default, you get your -- your
application is granted, and that seems odd when the
thrust of this arrangement is that the decision should
be in the hands of the local governing board or the
local council or something.  And then to say because of
the procedural lapse, then you emerge the winner and it
doesn't matter what good reasons the town might have
had.
MR. FISHER:  Well, there's two important
things about that, Justice Ginsburg.  First is the
ordinary remedy is an injunction.  We think that's the
ordinary remedy.  That's an equitable remedy that, of
course, isn't absolute.  And the second reason is, is
why that's the remedy.  Remember, the whole purpose of
this Act is to defeat local intransigents.  In other
words, process is the problem, not the solution.  So
simply requiring additional process, additional time,
additional reasons, that's exactly what the Act is
designed to solve, that problem that existed before
1996.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I suppose that could
be left up to the district court on remand.
MR. FISHER:  Of course, Justice Kennedy.
The Eleventh Circuit didn't reach the remedy question.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me ask you, I think we
would have a much different case if at the time of the
written notice, they appended the official copy of the
transcript.  Is the problem here that the transcript was
too late?
MR. FISHER:  That's one problem, but it's
not the only problem.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because it seems to me you
don't make the lateness part -- you don't make the
lateness argument that the government makes in your --
in your question presented.  You do say that there has
to be a -- whether documents stating the application
been denied but providing no reasons.  So I suppose we
can imply from that that you think that the later copy
of the transcript is -- is just not applicable.
MR. FISHER:  That's right, Justice Kennedy.
We think that's one problem, but it's not the only
problem.  Even if the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But do you -- I'm
sorry.
MR. FISHER:  Even if the transcript had been
attached, there still wouldn't have been, based on this
letter, a specification of reasons.  And I'd be happy to
walk the Court through exactly why that's so if you
have a question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, before you do
so, why is the transcript required?  They had minutes
that summarized the testimony.  Your position is not
that the transcript had to be attached.
MR. FISHER:  No, it's not.  I think Justice
Kennedy asked me if the transcript had been attached,
and so I was saying that -- taking -- taking that
question as -- as I got it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if the -- I'm
sorry.
MR. FISHER:  The minutes would be enough --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I may not have
followed this.  If the transcript were attached, what?
MR. FISHER:  Then that would not be enough
on its own --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, okay.
MR. FISHER:  -- because the letter would
still need to tell us where in the transcript the
reasons were.  And I'd like to walk the Court through --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fisher, you're deriving
all this from the word "decision" and "decision" as even
the dictionary you principally cite, Blacks Law
Dictionary states, "decision," you know, can mean one of
two things.  It can mean an opinion or it can mean a
judgment, and people refer to it -- use that word to
refer to either.  So why should we interpret it your
way?
MR. FISHER:  For two reasons, Justice Kagan.
One is because the overall context of the Act and the
substantial evidence review requirement and the overall
purpose tell us that "decision" needs to specify
reasons.  You can't conduct substantial evidence review
until you know what the reasons are.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that only suggests
that you need reasons.  It doesn't suggest that the
reasons have to appear in a decision as opposed to some
other document.
MR. FISHER:  Fair enough.  So one other part
of the Act, which is the expedited review provision, I
think, also is instructive.  The idea that Congress had
in mind was that parties could show up in a district
court and go straight to the question whether evidence
in the record supported the city's decision.  Congress
did not contemplate what we would have under the City's
approach or even the Solicitor General's approach, which
is an entire first phase of litigation devoted to
figuring out what those reasons are.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the larger problem
here, of course, is that under your view, the Federal
statute says that a local legislative body has to act
like an administrative agency, and that raises very
serious concern under Federalism.  In the -- in the law
of zoning, generally -- forget this Act -- in the law of
zoning generally, if you go to the board of supervisors
and want to rezone the property from agriculture to
multi-family residential, do we say that due process
requires them to give some reason?  Is there anything in
the law of zoning generally that says you have to give
reasons?
MR. FISHER:  I don't think generally.  If
there were a liberty interest or a property interest at
stake --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It would be like Goldberg
v. Kelley for – zoning.
MR. FISHER:  Right.  And we cite in our
brief the Wolff v. McDonnell case, which says that when
liberty or property interests are at stake, minimal due
process requires a specification of reasons.  And it's
not the only time that cities provide specifications of
reasons.  They do it on their own.  If you look at J
(a)(84) and if you look at Footnote 4 of our reply
brief, we cite numerous instances where the city takes
it upon itself already to provide reasons for denials of
permits.  They do it --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher, could you
explain how you are disadvantaged?  Now, first of all,
what happens on remand to the district court in your
view?  The Eleventh Circuit rendered its decision, the
case is remanded, what happens on remand?
MR. FISHER:  Well, as the case stands now,
we prevailed in the district court and the district
court gave us an injunction allowing the site to be
constructed.  The city took an appeal to the Eleventh
Circuit which reversed on the question of whether the
Act was violated.  So I think what would happen, after
this Court rules, it would go back to the Eleventh
Circuit with the case in that -- in that posture.
If I could say a couple more things about --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then what would -- then
if this Court should uphold the Eleventh Circuit, then
what happens?
MR. FISHER:  If you uphold the Eleventh
Circuit, then we go back down to the district court and
are going to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what happens there?
MR. FISHER:  And I think there we're going
to have to have one of these prolonged proceedings to
decide what -- first of all, what the reasons are.  The
city has already filed one brief in the district court,
before this case started to go up on appeal, where it
took the position that there were three reasons for its
denial:  Property values, the fact that T-Mobile
allegedly already had sufficient service in the area,
and compatibility with the neighborhood.
The city, in this Court, has offered some
different reasons.  The Solicitor General offers a still
different take on the transcript and the minutes.  And
so, first we have to have in the district court one of
these first mini hearings that I've been describing.
And then we would, perhaps, then be able to litigate the
question Congress contemplated, which is substantial
evidence followed by some other arguments we might make.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Fisher, assume, and
just for the sake of argument, that we do say that a
separate writing that clearly sets forth or sets forth
the reasons for denial is adequate.  I understand you to
say that this is not adequate because it's not clear
presumably; am I correct?
MR. FISHER:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under this board's
rules, do -- I'm assuming the board has to be unanimous,
majoritarian voting rules, but why does every council
member have to have the same reason?  Can't different
people say no for different reasons?
MR. FISHER:  I think, Justice Sotomayor,
they might be able to.  The ordinary course would be a
letter that provides reasons that speak for the entire
council.  But I wouldn't deem it impossible for a letter
to come to us that says two city council members voted
to deny the application for this reason and two others
voted to deny the application for another reason.  We
can still use that to go into district court and the
district court could still do its job.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh.  So your --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you say you can't use
it in this case.  You say that that factor renders
the -- the giving of reasons inadequate.
MR. FISHER:  No, Justice Scalia, it's not
just the multiplicity of people on the board stating
different things.  It's the fact that we don't know
whether those statements constitute reasons.  And this
is one thing I really would love to give you a couple of
examples.
There are many problems, first of all,
arising out of the first question whether or not what
citizens and experts say can constitute reasons.  The
Solicitor General says:  Well, there has to be a clear
indication that the voting members agree with that.
Well, what if somebody just says, that's a good point,
we'll take it into consideration?  Or, thanks, you know,
I'll -- I'll think about that?  What about the fact that
a member, him or herself, might say something with an
equivocal tone.  For example, Dr. Price said:  I'm not
sure how to assess property values here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, doesn't that --
MR. FISHER:  Does that count as a reason?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  All of these kinds of
examples, don't they only suggest that a State or a
locality would be well advised to write up a little
paragraph that clearly states its reasons?  But, you
know, if they want to take the risk that a district
court is going to say, gosh, I just can't find the
reasons in this record, it's all too muddled.  If they
want to take that risk, what in the statute prevents it?
MR. FISHER:  The nature of substantial
evidence review, which has a limiting principle --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  But I mean, substantial
evidence review requires reasons.  If they want to take
the risk that their -- that their minutes or their
transcript will not allow the district court to do
substantial evidence review, then, you know, they'll
lose.
MR. FISHER:  But, Justice Kagan, substantial
evidence review requires them to defend only on their
actual reasons.  And what the city wants to do is have a
record of over a hundred pages where anything it can
find a foothold in, the lawyers can come in and make an
argument that that's why they denied something.  That
not only frustrates process, but even, Justice Kennedy,
to your question about Federalism, it starts to
frustrate Federalism, because now Federal courts are
deciding why local government -- local governments --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I'm surprised that --
that you're willing to accept that there does not have
to be a reason or a number of reasons that -- that the
city council agrees on, that, you know, seven members of
the city council, each -- each one of them has a
different reason, and that's okay.  Do you think that
that's what the statute means?
MR. FISHER:  Well, I'm not sure, Justice
Kennedy -- Justice Scalia.  It -- you don't have to
decide that in this case.  The Solicitor General
reserves it in a footnote.  I'm not sure that just like
this voting body can reach a decision without a single
reason -- you know, these local government boards I
think are really acting in an adjudicatory posture here,
so I wouldn't want to preclude that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  But one can interpret
the statute as demanding that they have a reason.  Now,
to be sure, that's contrary to normal legislative
action.  Congress doesn't have to have a particular
reason for a statute.  Every -- every congressman can
have a different reason, and it's still valid.  But I --
I would read this as saying the city needs to -- when it
denies, it has to have a reason for denying.  I don't --
I don't know how else you read it.
MR. FISHER:  I certainly won't argue with
that.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then what's the
disagreement?  I mean, what's the disagreement between
you and the Solicitor General?  Justice Brandeis said
years ago, which I thought was a great statement of law
which doesn't ordinarily appear:  Before we can say
whether an agency decision is right or wrong, we have to
understand what it means.
MR. FISHER:  Uh-huh.
JUSTICE BREYER:  You get some piece of
paper, you can't figure out what it means, well, then
they'll send it back or they say no.  That's what judges
do with administrative agencies all the time.  Your
question says, do they have to have reasons?  Yeah.
Their question says can it appear in a separate
document?  Why not, as long as the document is given
about the same time?  So what's the problem?
MR. FISHER:  The problem -- we do agree with
the Solicitor General, you need reasons.  We also agree
with the Solicitor General that they need to be clear.
Where we part ways with the Solicitor General is on the
proposition that the ordinary administrative record can
meet that clarity standard.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Sometimes it could,
sometimes it couldn't.  It depends on what it says.
MR. FISHER:  Well, let me -- let me just
talk about the record in this case, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's the -- I know.
You want -- that's what you really want to say.  You
want to say the record here isn't good enough.  But it
seems to me that the one thing we're not deciding is
whether the record here is good enough.  Rather, the
questions have been put to us in general terms; we can
answer them in general terms.  We probably even might be
able to write an opinion in three paragraphs, clear.
MR. FISHER:  What I want to use is the
record here to be illustrative, Justice Breyer.  There's
nothing unusual about this record in the sense that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah, yes.  But to do that, I
would have to know quite a lot, wouldn't I, about --
about the situation of your client, about the situation
of the city council, about what was actually meant by
what they said about the context.  You understand the
problem.
MR. FISHER:  Well, let me -- let me just
give you a few examples.  At JA 336, 338, and 340 are
the parts of the minutes that the city and the Solicitor
General rely on.  And they say things, for example, in
equivocal ways, as I was describing.  We don't know
whether that was a reason.  We also have a temporal
problem that arises sometimes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  As I understand the SG's
position, the SG says there were five members of the
council, three of them talked about the incompatibility
of this tower with the neighborhood.  So what in that
statement do you contest?
MR. FISHER:  That statement is --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think that three of
them did not base this on the incompatibility of the
fake tree with the neighborhood?
MR. FISHER:  I'm not a hundred percent
certain they did, because the motion, as is set forth in
JA 340, comes after all of those statements.  There are
many other statements, Justice Kagan.  One -- one -- one
council member said:  I don't think cell towers should
ever be able to be built in a residential neighborhood.
Another asked whether T-Mobile could use different
technology to establish the cell site.
So we don't know whether these statements,
which also were right around the same time, also are
things the city could defend on.  And I'm not sure the
Solicitor General even has taken a position as to
whether or not there are any other reasons in the
record.  The Solicitor General has told us there's one
thing we can consider.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  The Solicitor General only
needs one.
MR. FISHER:  Well, no.  They don't
necessarily need one, Justice Kagan, because in the
district court we're going to challenge for substantial
evidence those reasons.  So it's going to be very
important if in the district court we can show, as we
think we can, that substantial evidence does not support
the city's incompatibility argument.  Then the question
is going to be is there another reason in the record,
and we haven't -- we have, perhaps, conflicting answers
from the -- from the other two lawyers in the room
today.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, then you're going to
reach the question that Justice Scalia had a view of,
which was, you know, if two people think X and two
people think Y and one person thinks Z, is that
sufficient?  But as long as you have something that
three people think, why isn't that sufficient?
MR. FISHER:  It's not sufficient because we
can't guarantee that that is why they voted.  These are
statements that come before a vote.  And just like in
this oral argument today, there's going to be many
concerns and questions that precede the vote.  The vote
may be for a different reason.  You don't know -- I'd
like to think that every answer I give today is going to
assuage any question that I get, but that's not
necessarily the case.  And it's not necessarily the case
that something a local council person says for a round
of applause in the room is exactly why they're going to
vote 10 minutes later on the application.
If I could reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. O'Connell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MS. O'CONNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
It's our position that a local government
must provide reasons when it denies permission to
construct a cell tower so that a court can conduct
substantial evidence review as contemplated by the
statute, but those reasons don't necessarily need to be
included in the same document as the city's written
denial of the application.  It's fine for the city to
give its reasons in some other document like meeting
minutes.  If the local government relies on a separate
document, that document must be available at the time
the written decision is issued.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where does that come
from?  There's nothing -- Ms. O'Connell, there's nothing
in the statute that says that the decision doesn't have
to have the reasons, something has to have the reasons.
It has to be, you say, fairly contemporaneous.  I don't
see anything -- you -- you are inserting something into
the statute that is not there.
MS. O'CONNELL:  The -- the primary reason
why we're saying it has to come out at the same time is
because otherwise it would frustrate the judicial review
provision, where the applicant has 30 days under the
statute to decide what action to take based on the
denial.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But wouldn't it more
sensible, then, to take a suggestion that has been made
that we run the 30 days from when reasons are given, run
30 days from when the minutes are available?  I don't
know why you have chosen a route that would say this
applicant wins automatically, no hearing, no nothing.
It doesn't matter that town's council had good reasons
for it, they weren't contemporaneous, that's the end of
it.
MS. O'CONNELL:  I think one reason why,
Justice Ginsburg, is because it's difficult to read the
statute that way.  The 30 days runs from the final
action of the local government, and the local government
has to issue a decision in writing.  It would be
difficult to say once you have a letter in hand that
says, dear applicant, your application has been denied,
that you don't have a written decision.  The applicant
would be left to wonder whether reasons are coming at
all, and if so, what those reasons are going to be.  And
I think if you follow that to its logical conclusion,
if -- if you didn't have reasons and didn't know if they
were coming, I guess what you would do, then, is wait
150 days from the day you filed your application and
then file a lawsuit saying, they didn't act on my
application in a reasonable time, which seems not
correct, given that they sent --
JUSTICE BREYER:  How does it work in -- in
the ordinary agency, which I should know but I don't?
The Federal Power Commission, a blessed memory, is faced
with an application by El Paso Natural Gas to add an
extension in a little area of New Mexico.  The power
commission denies.  There are five votes.  One person
says I'm denying because we don't need the gas; a second
person says I'm denying because it's ugly; a third
person says I'm denying because it blocks certain
animals from getting to their feeding place; and the
other two vote to grant, all right?  That's arisen in
the course of the last 100 years, something like that.
How do the courts handle that?
MS. O'CONNELL:  In footnote 6 of our brief
we describe some cases along those lines, where -- I
mean, in this case we think that you have a majority,
three of five given the same reason --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But if -- I just want to
know how it works in the case I put.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.  In -- in the cases
we describe in footnote 6, some courts have said and the
D.C. Circuit did assume in one case that we cited that
you need a majority, but other courts have said that
it's okay as long as -- if everybody gives a different
rationale, as long as you can get to a majority; you can
conduct substantial evidence review of each of those
rationales.  And we think that makes sense here because
the statute gives reasons why you can't deny an
application.  It doesn't say there are only certain
permissible reasons why you can't.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But doesn't the
Administrative Procedure Act require providing reasons
when -- when there's a grant or a denial?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes.  And we agree that
reasons are required.  The question Justice Breyer was
asking was what if you don't have a majority in -- in
support of any particular rationale, and the response is
we've cited some cases in footnote 6.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't -- don't you have to
give the reasons with the decision under the APA?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So how can you give it
if -- if there is no majority for any single reason?
MS. O'CONNELL:  You would just -- you would
give the rationales of each individual council member.
This is not -- it's not a problem that's unique.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Has this Court ever held
that?  Because I would never hold that.
MS. O'CONNELL:  No, no.  It's not a --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's absurd.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Justice Scalia, we cited
some cases in footnote 6 of our brief that indicate that
other courts have allowed that to occur.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm -- I'm a little bit
confused by that because -- and this is what troubles me
the most.  You get five council members, five different
reasons.  At what point does he win, meaning if he
proves that three of them were wrong in their reasons,
so there wasn't a majority vote for anything?  That's
what he has to do?
MS. O'CONNELL:  There weren't a majority of
council members that gave a reason that wasn't
prohibited by the statute or was not supported by
substantial evidence.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a --
MS. O'CONNELL:  And it's not a problem
that's unique to this particular context.  That comes up
sometimes in agency decisions where there's a
multi-member body that's heading the agency.  The cases
in footnote 6 --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you want us to write an
opinion that says under this Act agencies have to comply
with SEC v. Chenery?  Or pardon me, city councils have
to comply with SEC v. Chenery?
MS. O'CONNELL:  We think that by requiring
that decisions be in writing and supported by
substantial evidence and then also by providing for
judicial review of those decisions, implicit in the
statute and explicit in the legislative history is that
the local government has to give reasons.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Either under general laws
of zoning or under any similar Federal statute, have we
ever imposed -- has the Federal Government ever imposed
requirements like this on a legislative body?
MS. O'CONNELL:  I don't think so, but it's
not -- I mean, we realize that this is a little bit of
an anomaly in this statute, that normally a city council
can do whatever it wants and it's not required to give
reasons for its decisions unless it's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it just a legislative
body?
MS. O'CONNELL:  No.  In this case, we think
it's acting sort of as a --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  I would -- I would
consider this as an adjudicative body.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.  It's -- it's not
making laws that would apply prospectively, but taking
a -- a specific ordinance that already exists and
applying it to the facts of this case.  But in any
event, that is the one thing that we think the statute
does require local governments to do that could be
different from its normal procedure, is to give reasons.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What does the -- what
does the Petitioner do with the one council member who
didn't give reasons?  What does that person count as?
MS. O'CONNELL:  So -- so if he didn't give a
reason, then I think you just don't count his -- his
vote toward the -- the people that gave a rationale.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What happens if --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It was four people who
were there.
MS. O'CONNELL:  There were five.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There were five.  One
didn't speak, so you don't count his or her vote.  So
it's a split vote.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes, but there were still
three people that gave incompatibility with the
neighborhood as their -- as their reason.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if -- what if three
people say, this is -- this is incompatible with the
neighborhood, and then later other -- another member or
other members provide other reasons, and those other
reasons are either invalid under the statute or not
supported by substantial evidence?  Under that
circumstance, is it -- can it be inferred that the final
vote of those who previously expressed the view that
this was bad for aesthetic reasons was the reason for
their vote?  That seems to be Mr. Fisher's argument, and
what's your answer to that?
MS. O'CONNELL:  I think -- I want to make
clear that we're not saying that when you look through
the written administrative record to determine what the
reasons are, that you read through the whole transcript
and that anything that came up during the hearing, like
what happens when the power goes out or can't you make
these things smaller or something like that is the
reason why a particular council member voted, just as we
wouldn't think questions at oral argument are your
reasons for voting to affirm or reverse.
But in this case, you can pretty easily see
that at the end of the hearing, the mayor said, okay,
now, if everybody is finished giving their testimony,
let's hear from the council, and they went down the line
and everybody said what they thought about it.  It's
those that we think are the reasons  that  each person has
given.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. O'Connell, I think part
of Mr. Fisher's arguments is that if everyone agrees
that reasons have to be given, what sense does it make
to require judges to scour the minutes and to scour the
transcript and to try to make these judgment calls
about, you know, when an individual council member has
given a reason?  Why not at that point, once we're in
the mode of requiring things, why not just require that
the reasons be stated in the two or three sentences that
the council or other body promulgates?
MS. O'CONNELL:  It's not our position that
such a requirement would be difficult to comply with.
The reason we oppose it is because we don't think
Congress went that far.  By requiring that decisions be
supported by substantial evidence and providing for
judicial review, we think Congress imposed a requirement
that reasons be given.  But other than that, they have a
savings clause that says that, other than what they
specifically said, nothing else should interfere with
the decision-making process of local governments.  And
so if it's part of that decision-making process to
normally talk about it at a meeting and give the
decisions orally and then write up a summary that's
written, then we don't think that the statute should
be --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think Justice Kagan is
not disagreeing with you.  She is saying, yes, reasons
must be given.  And reasons  aren’t  given if there's just
this exchange in which a congressman -- a councilman
expresses a certain fondness for a particular view.
What -- what is the big deal of requiring either that
the full council give its reasons or if you think it's
enough that different councilmen have different reasons,
each councilman say, I am voting against this for this
reason?  What is the big deal about that?
MS. O'CONNELL:  There is certainly not a big
deal about it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Especially since you're
making the council do the same thing.  You're making
them give reasons, right?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So why not say you have to
spell the reasons out?
MS. O'CONNELL:  I think the -- that is part
of substantial evidence review and part of Chenery, that
the reasons have to be clear.  That's not part of our
test.  It's inherent in substantial evidence review, and
we do think the statement has to be sufficiently clear
to conduct substantial evidence review.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Carothers.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CAROTHERS
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. CAROTHERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The Respondent in this case, the City of
Roswell, its amicus, the Solicitor General, and the
Eleventh, Fourth, and Eighth Circuits all agree that
332(c)(7)(B)(iii) neither explicitly nor implicitly
requires that reasons be provided in the written denial
itself as long as there are reasons provided elsewhere
in the written minutes or transcript.
In this case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So when do you think the
statute of limitations runs?
MR. CAROTHERS:  That's a very good question.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The 30 days?
MR. CAROTHERS:  I have -- I have pondered
that because it is an issue in this case, but also, it's
an issue going forward.  It's not really an issue in our
case because the 30 days, when it ran, there had already
been the approval of the minutes, the written denial had
gone out, and the appeal was able to be timely.  There
seems to be a split in the Federal circuits as to
whether that should be --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Was -- was able
to be timely, which means if all of that comes in 5 days
before the deadline, it is still able to be timely?  I
thought they were given 30 days to decide whether --
whether to go forward or not and you're saying it's
enough if before the 30 days has totally expired,
they -- they can figure out what the city council
decided.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Justice Scalia, that is
essentially correct, but what we are saying is we
believe that the 30 days should run, as Justice Kagan
suggested, from the approval of the minutes.  If you
have the minutes approved --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in this case -- in
this case, May 10th the minutes were approved, and May
13th the suit was filed because the time ran out on May
14th.
MR. CAROTHERS:  That's correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you think that's
sufficient?
MR. CAROTHERS:  I think it is only
sufficient for this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The 30-day period is so
there can be a carefully reasoned decision whether or
not to file a suit.  Under your view, you have only 3
days.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Justice Kennedy, that --
that is what happened in this case.  That is not --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought you were taking
the position, in answer to the government, that says you
have to have it contemporaneous because of the 30 days
that the company has to make up its mind whether to seek
judicial review.  But I think you made the suggestion,
which I then put to counsel, that just have the 30 days
run from when the reasons are available.  So instead of
having it run from when they send you a letter that says
denied, treat that as not final until the reasons are
given.  I thought that was your position.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Justice Ginsburg, that is
exactly what we're saying, and for three reasons.  One,
the approval of the minutes -- we've talked about
substantial evidence, we've talked about the substantial
evidence has to be affirmed by reasons given somewhere
in the record.  The way to know what that is, it doesn't
talk about a letter.  It talks about final action in
(B)(iv) and, therefore, the final action of those
minutes is the approval of those minutes.
Secondarily what that does is, when the
minutes are approved, the applicant, if unsuccessful,
has the opportunity to have 30 full days, knowing what's
in the record, in order to file the appeal, and that
dovetails with the recommendation of the Solicitor
General about the contemporaneous minutes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So are you saying --
MR. CAROTHERS:  Excuse me.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you saying that
the actual decision is the minutes --
MR. CAROTHERS:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- as opposed to the
letter you've sent?
MR. CAROTHERS:  That is correct.
The letter is a more or less, while the
Petitioner does not like this word, it is a
notification.  It is a statement that it has been
denied.  Why is that?  Because, as this Court has
referred to it and other courts have referred to it,
this whole telecommunications jurisprudence across the
country is a patchwork, and in this particular instance,
there are jurisdictions that don't require any
notification, there are jurisdictions that require
something be entered on the minutes, there are
jurisdictions that require a letter, there are
jurisdictions that require a certified letter.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In your view, if they had
waited 60 days before they approved the minutes, then we
wait until then for the time period to run?
MR. CAROTHERS:  That is correct, Justice
Kennedy.  The only -- the only impediment to any of this
is the shot clock, and I think that -- and I think that
if the 150 days starts to run, there's going to be a
problem if the local government hasn't approved their
minutes by that time.  That may well not give the
applicant a record that does not have substantial
evidence in it.
JUSTICE BREYER:  The facility placing --
everyone loves cell phones, apparently.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  Nobody likes towers,
apparently.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  So Congress passes a law.
It says:  You've got to have towers, I'm sorry, and the
local community can stop it, but they can't stop it for
one of three substantive reasons; and in addition, they
have to show that their decision was rational, which is
done -- or reasonable, which is done by having a record
with substantial evidence.  That's what this means to
me.
Now, your clients and others aren't used to
being agencies, but they're being treated like agencies
and, therefore, the simplest thing is to read this two
things together, just what Justice Kagan said, write the
decision and give your reasons because otherwise there
is no way to know whether there's substantial evidence
or not.  It's in the same clause.  It's in the same
phrase.  The words are right there.  It says "decision
supported by substantial evidence."  I know -- that's, I
think, the basic argument.
The Solicitor General doesn't go that far,
but if we don't have simplicity, we'll have 2 million
different ways of going about this between different
cities and counties.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why couldn't the city
council or this legislative body have waited until its
official minutes and sent the letter that day with the
minutes?
MR. CAROTHERS:  That they could have, and I
think that is what the Solicitor General is
recommending.  That was certainly not the law at the
time, but that that is -- the way to have
contemporaneous minutes is to have the writing be
basically at the time that it's approved.
One of the problems is -- and one of the
problems with this decision to deny a request is in
order to state those reasons, it has to have the very
minutes approved in order to look at it and say, these
are the reasons.
Now, I would suggest to this Court that that
will only start a new inquiry, and that is the minutes
-- excuse me, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand -- I
don't understand what you're saying, it requires a
written decision.  Okay.  And the city council here
issued a written decision to the phone company saying,
we have decided to deny your request.
Now -- and you're saying that is not a
written decision, you have to wait until the minutes are
written up.  So, what, were they lying when they said,
we've decided?
MR. CAROTHERS:  I think what I'm saying,
Justice Scalia, is that the writing that is sent --
we've had a lot of verbiage in the briefs about what is
a decision and how to characterize that decision and
whether it has some sort of opinion to it or whether
it's just, this is what we did.  The statute -- in the
-- requires substantial evidence in a written record which
necessitates reasons.  Those can only be ascertained by
the official minutes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But then you're agreeing
with your opponents, it seems to me .  You have the
document, the document says "denied," and there it gives
the reasons for denying so people can see if there's
substantial evidence.
You're just saying it was the later
document.  They're saying it was the earlier document.
I don't know.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Well, Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But do you agree with them
on that, that one document --
MR. CAROTHERS:  I don't agree with him on
that, Justice Breyer.  But I agree with what you just
stated, that the minutes, when approved, they have
substantial --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I don't know if they
should be called "the minutes."  I'm not an expert on
that area of city government.  I don't know whether you
want to call the document "minutes" or whether you want
to call the document "written decision."  That seems to
be not before us, but what is before us is whether the
decision has to have in it the reasons so that we can
tell if it's supported by substantial evidence.  You
agree on that one?
MR. CAROTHERS:  Again, I agree, Justice
Breyer, as you have stated it.  I disagree that that
particular decision is the one that is sent out right
after the hearing, and in my proposal it wouldn't be
sent right after the hearing.  It would be sent after
the minutes,  so you would have the collective record
which is referred to by the Eleventh Circuit, which
could be --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that endorses more
or less the SG's position.  What you're saying, I think,
in answer to the question presented, the written denial
doesn't have to itself as a document, provide the
reasons, but when it's sent it has to have attached to
it, referenced, something that is available telling you
the reasons.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Well, and I'm not sure it
has to tell the reasons if it attaches that, because the
reasons will be in there and it'll be up to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Something that --
MR. CAROTHERS:  -- the district court to
either ascertain, glean, clearly indicate --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it's ineffective unless
that exists.  So that what was given here in writing was
not a decision, but what?  A we intend to decide when
the minutes are finally written?  A prediction?  What
was it then --
MR. CAROTHERS:  I would characterize --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that the phone company
got?
MR. CAROTHERS:  -- it as a notification of
the denial, but the specific --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It hasn't been denied yet.
You're saying it's not denied until the minutes are
written --
MR. CAROTHERS:  I would --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- which is, you know, God
knows when.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Well, it has to be done with
the minutes, and you've got the shot clock running, but
you can't have -- you can't make the applicants --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you shouldn't send
anything out then because according to you, there has
been no decision.  You shouldn't send out a notice that
we've decided.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Going forward, Justice
Scalia, that is our recommendation --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what you ought to
do.
MR. CAROTHERS:  -- and I think that if you
adopt, as Omnipoint has and Helcher and some other
Federal cases, that, in fact, it should be the approval
of the minutes, then I think that whole issue goes away.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it sounds like you're
changing your position.  Page 34 of the red brief, that
given the plain wording of the statute, whether a
document from a -- the question is, whether a document
from a State or local government stating the application
has been denied but providing no reasons can satisfy the
statutory requirement.  And the simple straightforward
answer is yes.
So now you're changing your position.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Justice Kennedy, I don't
believe I am stating the position.  What we're saying is
it satisfies that portion of the statute.  It doesn't
satisfy the substantial evidence in the written record
which has got to be -- which we contend, separated by
the word "and," the conjunctive, that is a separate
requirement.  And one of the things I think that I want
to -- the point I want to make is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But where -- but surely,
under your view -- I'm not convinced that your position
hasn't radically changed -- but surely under your view,
what you've explained to us at page 34, the 30 days
begins to run the minute the notice is given.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Justice Kennedy, again, I
think when we use words like "notice" and "decision,"
the letter -- or the statute says, "Decision in writing
of the denial."  That doesn't mean that is elevated to a
decision by this Court or a decision by a lower court
that has all of the findings and conclusions and the
reasons, because the reasons are going to come from the
minutes, and that's why we're advocating that the
minutes be the start of the 30-day period, and there can
be a confluence of the letter --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you --
JUSTICE ALITO:  That may be what the -- what
the statute means in light of the practicalities of the
situation.  Now, since it talks about substantial
evidence review, there's an argument that a
municipality, when it makes a decision like this, should
be treated pretty much like a Federal administrative
agency.  But on the other hand, municipalities are
sometimes very small.  These -- these bodies are --
consist of lay people who are not learned in the law,
they may not have attorneys available to them who are
very knowledgeable about Federal telecommunications law.
So can you say something about that
situation?  Is any of that true with respect to -- to
Roswell?  And what do you think Congress may have had in
mind in a situation with respect to the treatment of
local governing bodies like Federal administrative
agencies?
MR. CAROTHERS:  Well, Justice Alito, that is
a multi-tiered question.  Let me see if I can answer it.
Number one, the amicus brief that was filed
on behalf of the City of Roswell basically lays out the
fact that you are exactly correct, there are lots of
municipalities and local governments throughout this
country that have trouble dealing with a pretty
sophisticated Federal statute.  The City of Roswell has
a relative degree of sophistication, it has attorneys,
and it has planners and can do that.
But no court has ever held, including this
Court, that the Chenery-type analysis for what needs to
be an administrative decision has an application to a
local government.  If you look, for instance, that --
that -- there is lots of argument from Petitioner that
there's something wrong with what Roswell did.  And if
you just look at, specifically, they had evidence in the
record, they had people who said this, this, this, this,
and this.  You had four council members, three of whom
said aesthetics, not right for the area, diminution of
property value, and the other one --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Carothers, I wonder
whether what Justice Alito pointed out about the nature
of local governments, which you agreed with, whether
that doesn't suggest that we should try to keep our rule
quite simple.  In other words, given that nobody in
small local governments has access to great lawyers or
knows a lot about communication, that we should just set
up a rule that enables them to comply simply.
And that rule, honestly, would be
Mr. Fisher's rule.  It would just say, in your decision,
write a sentence or two saying why.  Because otherwise,
if we don't have that rule and every judge has to look
through the minutes and the transcript and anything else
in the record to decide whether a reason is clear
enough, there are going to be a lot of local governments
that are going to get kind of caught, and the judge is
going to say, I'm sorry, it's not clear enough, even
though if the government had spent just five minutes, it
could have made it clear enough.  And maybe we should
just say, do that so that you don't get caught.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Well, Justice Kagan, I -- I
don't object to that as long as the minutes are the
final decision and so the 30 days can run from there.
But then you're going to have that decision that's not
going to come out for a couple months until the city
attorneys and the planners have time to digest the
decision of the record in orders to formulate that.
And I will suggest to the Court that if, in
fact, that occurs, it starts the process over because
then the challenge is going to be the statements in the
letter do not accurately reflect the minutes, they
misstate the minutes, they mischaracterize the minutes.
In fact, they're a post hoc rationalization of what was
in the minutes.  We are going to have yet another line
of inquiry and challenge which could be avoided if we
simply waited for the letter and approve the minutes --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that inquiry and
challenge will be left up to judges to figure out what
the minutes say, don't say, and what the reasons were.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Well, Justice Sotomayor,
as -- as I read the jurisprudence, the fact is the
substantial evidence in a written record and to see the
reasons is pretty much left up to the district court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Let's go
back to, we had five members here.  One didn't talk.  Do
you agree we don't count that person?
MR. CAROTHERS:  Correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Now, do we
need a majority rule, a majority of the council people
giving a reason?
MR. CAROTHERS:  I don't believe that is the
case, Justice Sotomayor, and I will say it because of
this.  It could be, but let's leave that situation.  The
situation we have here was we had three persons of a
pretty like mind, the aesthetics, the land use, the
diminution of property values, that made a determination
and said, we -- we think that these are real bad.  Then
you have a pretty long motion by Dr. Price --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, they said that before
the vote.  We don't know why they voted.  What -- what's
the big deal of having a city council say, we deny this
request for the following reasons:  One, two, three?
That would be very clear; there'd be no problem at all.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Justice Scalia, I think that
is exactly what happened in that -- in this case by the
majority vote on Dr. Price's motion.  Now, I will
concede to you that the council members did not stand
and say I'm voting for Dr. Price's motion because of
this, this, and this.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose we issue an
opinion in this case that says that the -- the formal
instrument of denial must say in simple terms the reason
or reasons for the denial.  All right?  Let's say we
issue that opinion, and six months later something like
this comes up in some rural municipality.  Let's say
they've got 1,000 people.  And how likely is it that the
members of the governing body there, or their attorney,
if they have an attorney, will be familiar with our
decision in T-Mobile South v. City of Roswell?
MR. CAROTHERS:  Well, I don't know the
answer to that exactly, Justice Alito, but I will say
that whatever the decision is in this case --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You know, I know that
everybody in the country hangs on our every word.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO:  And they're all going to
read this opinion.
MR. CAROTHERS:  What everybody in the
country has, Justice Alito, is they have people knocking
at the door to put up cell towers.  So this is a topic
that many, many cities are attuned to.
But what I am attempting to say and urge the
Court is to adopt, I think, all of the concerns the
Court raises.  If the 30 days runs from the approval of
the minutes, then you have the opportunity to have a
writing --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Please articulate your
rule, because you just said to us earlier that not every
body of this type has -- has minutes, or minutes that
become the statement of reasons.  So what's the rule, a
general rule about what's the final decision and when
the time starts to run, assuming --
MR. CAROTHERS:  Justice Sotomayor, what I
would -- what I would craft and -- and what I believe to
be the appropriate rule is the denial letter simply says
denied.  That's what the statute says.  It doesn't
require any reasons.  It could have required reasons.
So put that issue aside.  And then that the approval of
the minutes be the final action that triggers the
running of the 30 days.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How does that rule --
now we're forcing minutes on every -- on every city
council to have contained the statement of reasons?
MR. CAROTHERS:  Justice Sotomayor, I don't
know how to answer that.  I don't know of a jurisdiction
that does not have some form of minutes or ratification
of the previous actions and discussions they've taken,
which are generally approved at the next meeting.
I think, in fact, if they're going to have
substantial evidence in the written record, whenever
those minutes are approved, they had better get into
doing minutes because that is what's going to be
required.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why -- why do we have to
say?  Why don't we take word for word almost what the --
what the court said?  What this statute requires is that
there be a written denial -- well, we can forget whether
it's separate or not -- describing the reasons for the
denial and containing a sufficient explanation to permit
the court to evaluate the evidence, period.
Now, that's what the city has to do.  And if
they produce something that's a mess because it's a
98-page thing of minutes and the court can't figure out
what it is, you'll get a decision like this.  If, in
fact, somebody summarizes at the beginning, these are
the reasons that we have denied and therefore we do deny
it, it won't be a problem.
MR. CAROTHERS:  Well, Justice Breyer, I
simply would argue that the minutes have to have
substantial evidence, which is -- or have to have the
reasons, which is supported by the substantial evidence.
And if the court can't discern what those are, they're
not going to survive the substantial evidence test.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, you -- you spoke
of the -- the statutory requirement of a denial letter.
Where -- where is that?
MR. CAROTHERS:  Justice Scalia, the -- the
statute indicates that in (B)(iii), any decision by a
state or local government or instrumentality therefore
to deny a request --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. CAROTHERS:  -- shall be in writing.
That is what I referred to as the denial letter.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not the denial
letter.  That's what you're referring to as the minutes.
You say it's the minutes that comply with that.
MR. CAROTHERS:  No, Your -- Your Honor, I am
saying that the minutes do comply with this --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, and constitute it.
MR. CAROTHERS:  But a simple notification
letter of the denial does not comply with it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There's no requirement of a
notification letter, whatever.  There's just that
provision that any decision shall be in writing and
supported by substantial evidence.  So why are you
imposing this obligation of a denial letter on these
poor, ignorant council members?
(Laughter.)
MR. CAROTHERS:  Your Honor, I am not trying
to impose that on them, but we -- I think we have to
take the statute as it's written.  We have to have some
meaning to what that is.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm taking it as it's
written.  You're making up a denial letter.  There's --
there's no requirement of a denial letter.  So if,
indeed, the decision is the minutes, you -- you don't
have to do anything until the minutes are published.
MR. CAROTHERS:  And I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose you have to give
a copy of the minutes to -- to -- to the loser.
MR. CAROTHERS:  That -- that is correct.
And, Justice Scalia, to the extent we're
talking about the same thing, I believe that the
decision from when the time should run is, in fact, that
approval of the minutes, which has the reasons based
upon the substantial record.  I don't see that that,
whether it's a denial, whether it's a notification,
whatever it is, it doesn't have to have reasons.  So
really, it doesn't help the applicant and doesn't help
the city, but we're trying to give the words in the
statute some effect.  We do not want to give them the
effect that it is a decision and glorify something
because a decision can be no.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Everybody else like you
thinks that there has to be a denial letter, right?
Is -- is that a unique perception that -- that you have
come to, or is it generally thought that you have to
have a denial letter?
MR. CAROTHERS:  I think -- I think there is
a perception, because of what the statute says, that
there has to be a denial letter, but it doesn't have to
have reasons.  And if you don't have the reasons in the
denial letter, you -- it's not fair to the applicant to
start the appeal time running for the 30 days.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did you take that position
in the district court?
MR. CAROTHERS:  Justice Kennedy, I'm
struggling to answer that question because we didn't get
very far in the district court.  We never really got a
chance to talk about substantial evidence because the
court decided:  I'm not going to reach that prong of
(B)(iii); I'm going to say that I can't understand --
excuse me.  Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:  Thank you.  I would like to
make a point about our rule and then turn to the
practicalities.
First, to -- to -- I think that what came
before me helped under -- helped explain why a separate
letter specifying the reasons for denial is not only
required by the statute, but is the only way to make it
work.
If you look at the minutes that the city
issued here, and they're in the back of the Joint
Appendix -- remember, as I think it's been noted, cities
don't have to issue minutes, and so you're not always
going to have minutes.  But on the theory that the
minutes here would have been enough, look at the
minutes, and if you want to look later at J.A. 338,
J.A. 336, and J.A. 340, there are some of the reasons,
as the Solicitor General put it, potential reasons,
offered by various council members before the vote.
But if you look at J.A. 340, you'll see that
all of those are separated from the motion, so the
motion doesn't incorporate any of the reasons, not even
what Dr. Price said before she made her motion.
So imagine yourself a district judge getting
this set of minutes.  You don't know what the city's
reasons were for denying the permit, and that's the
problem that T-Mobile has and that's the problem the
district judges  have.
And I want to turn to Justice Alito's
question -- and, Justice Kennedy, I think you also asked
about the Federalism implications for local governments.
First of all, let me start with the City of
Roswell.  The City of Roswell's own code, and this is at
J.A. 84, requires it to give a separate document with
reasons if it denies an application to construct a cell
site on city-owned property.  All we're asking the city
to do is do what it already does with respect to
applications for city-owned property.
Now, you also point out there are rural
areas in the country that have smaller staffs and
jurisdictions.  At -- at page 13 of our reply brief we
cite statutes from other States like New Hampshire,
Nevada, Idaho, that already have as a matter of State
law the rule that we pronounce -- I'm sorry, the rule
that we propose.  The rural jurisdictions in those
States don't seem to have difficulty doing it, and I
think the reason why is because, as has been said a few
times today, it just requires a few sentences usually.
Just tell us what the reasons are and tell the district
court what the reasons are, so that when we get into
court we can have the streamlined proceeding that
Congress imagined, and that it can be done, as the
statute itself requires, on an expedited basis.
That's all we're asking for today, and we
think that any other rule is going to create problems at
the lower -- I'm sorry, before you ever get to court and
even more problems once we get to court.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fisher, suppose that I
think that you're right about that, but then the
question is did Congress require that.  And I take it
that the SG is really saying, no, Congress required
reasons, it required that by saying that there was
substantial evidence review, but that it didn't require
the reasons to be in any particular form, and, indeed,
there's a savings clause which says that all doubts go
to the State and local governments in this area.  So
notwithstanding that this is going to actually get State
and local governments into some trouble, and
notwithstanding that district courts are going to
struggle with it, we should go with the SG's rule rather
than with yours.
MR. FISHER:  We think the best reading of
sub (iii) is that Congress actually did require this.
As the city itself pointed out, it separates
the notion of a decision in writing from whether it has
substantial evidence in the record that supports it.  So
when you ask what the decision in writing is, you
need -- we think the best reading of that is that's the
reasons.  The reasons have to be supported by
substantial evidence, and you can't ask the substantial
evidence question until you know what the reasons are.
And I think also, for the other reasons that
we've pointed out and the Chamber of Commerce pointed
out, how the Communications Act uses the word "decision"
in a particular way.  It uses the word "decision" in
other statutes to signify that an explanation is -- is
something embedded in that, not as -- as -- as is often
the case, and the city itself characterized the denial
letter today, I think aptly, as a notification.
Well, the Communications Act uses the words
"notify" and "notification" to refer to other kinds of
advisements that need to be given.  That's not the word
Congress chose here.
So, Justice Kagan, I agree, but if you look
at this statute you might wonder to yourself if you
misread the words in a vacuum which are -- which rule
comes out of it, ours or the SG's.
But we know from City of Arlington, as this
Court said, that the limitations in sub (iii) are
limitations that Congress did intend to impose and the
best reading of those limitations are the ones that we
have given.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
