CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
This Court granted certiorari to decide
whether ERISA's statute of limitations bars claims for
breaches of fiduciary duty regarding investment options
that were added to a plan more than six years before the
suit was filed.  The answer is no.  The statute does not
bar such claims for three reasons.
First, ERISA's fiduciary duties include
monitoring existing investment options and removing
imprudent ones.  Second, each failure to review and
remove an imprudent investment option starts a new
statute of limitations.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  One of the things that I
was looking for, Mr. Frederick, in the record is some
evidence as to what exactly that monitoring entails.
I -- I took your brother's responsive brief as saying it
can't be a complete due diligence that you do when you
buy something, otherwise, the funds would grind to a
halt.
So where in the record is there some proof
of what the monitoring -- or what the level of
monitoring should have been and what the breach was
here?
MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Sotomayor, we were
precluded at summary judgment from making the argument
that the continued imprudence of maintaining these
investment options was a breach of fiduciary duty.  The
district court's summary judgment order -- and I would
direct the Court to Petition Appendix 262 to 263 --
barred us from bringing imprudence claims as to the
funds added in 1999.  At page 180 in the Petition
Appendix, the district court explained that applying a
circuit precedent known as Phillips, the plaintiffs had
to prove that there was a change in circumstances
significant enough to make the continued investment in
that investment option an imprudent one.
So the theory that we were precluded by the
summary judgment order from advancing was the theory
that keeping this investment option available during
this time period was imprudent.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But if -- if we agree that
there had to be some significant event or change that
would trigger the -- the need to reexamine this
investment, then we would affirm.
MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
MR. FREDERICK:  What -- what happened at
trial was that after the summary judgment order, the
judge barely opened the door to say if, plaintiffs, you
can show that there was a significant enough change,
I'll allow you to prove that there was -- that it was
equivalent to the new selection of an investment option,
and -- and we lost on that issue as a factual matter.
That was affirmed on appeal.  And --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's your position?
That -- that every -- every stock that is owned has to
be reviewed every year as though it was a new purchase?
MR. FREDERICK:  No.  Our position is that
the periodic duty to monitor requires at least some
familiarity with the filings of that particular fund and
an awareness of what the expenses and performance of it
are.  This expense ratio information, Justice Scalia, is
readily available on the Internet; it is readily
available with a phone call or two.  It is part of the
SEC filings.  And unlike an initial review where a fund
manager would look at thousands of mutual funds in the
industry, all that we're saying here is that the trustee
should have looked at what was publicly available
information about the very mutual funds that were part
of this particular plan.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You also said, did you
not, that -- that there was this committee that met
periodically to review investments?  I think you said
they met quarterly.
MR. FREDERICK:  Correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that there had been,
as a result of those quarterly reviews, changes --
MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- in investments.
MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.  And, in
fact, the district court found that as to a fund that
was being reviewed in 2003, they discovered that there
were institutional shares available and they immediately
switched to the lower cost institutional shares.  But
the district court further found that as to the other
funds that were added in 2002, the trustees had never
made an inquiry about the availability of lower cost
institutional funds.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That was one of the
questions I had in my own mind.  Did you ever argue
below that once they found out about the
institutional -- the institutional funds, that that was
a changed circumstance?
MR. FREDERICK:  Well, it was only as to the
one fund that had been changed, but the court recall in
its summary judgment order on page 262 had said, you're
barred from bringing claims of imprudence as to the
funds added in 1999.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Unless there were
changed circumstances.
MR. FREDERICK:  Unless there were
significant changes, so significant -- and this was the
holding of the prior Ninth Circuit and the Fourth
Circuit and Eleventh Circuit precedents that would be
tantamount to adding a new fund.  So just simply because
there are existing institutional share funds for mutual
funds out there was not deemed by the district court to
meet that standard.
And in their post-trial brief, and this is
at the docket at page 3 -- docket number 381 at page 13,
which we quote in our reply brief, "Edison said we had
gone beyond what the district court summary judgment
order was and, therefore, we were precluded from making
arguments about the imprudence of the 1999 funds."
JUSTICE ALITO:  If we forget what happened
at earlier stages of this litigation, and I think that
the parties' positions have clarified, when you put it
that way, as this has progressed, what -- on what point
of law do you and Mr. Hacker now disagree?  I'm not sure
you disagree.  You certainly do not disagree about what
the answer to the question presented is.  You both say
no.  It is not categorically barred.  So on what point
of law do you disagree?
MR. FREDERICK:  I think that the point of
law that we disagree -- and I would urge you,
Justice Alito, to ask that question to Mr. Hacker,
because their brief is somewhat schizophrenic.  At the
beginning, they say no, and at the end, they say yes.
They ask you to affirm the Ninth Circuit on the merits,
and the Ninth Circuit held that there was a significant
change in circumstances.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, but forget --
MR. FREDERICK:  And that is the point,
Justice Alito, where I think we disagree.  We do not
believe that ERISA's statutory standard, which is at
1104(a)(1)(b), and it says that the standard by statute
is what a reasonable investor would do under the
circumstances then prevailing, would require the
introduction of an added burden to overcome, which is
that there had been significant changed circumstances
since the initial investment.
That lookback within the limitations period
looks at whether or not the investment option is an
imprudent one.  And it doesn't matter whether there had
been significant or insignificant changed circumstances
since the initial option.
And let me point to you the fact that the
district court here adopted this principle and this rule
to lead to really absurd results.  The Ninth --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I will ask Mr. Hacker.
But I -- you understand him to take the position that
unless there are some changed circumstances, a trustee
can simply make no inquiry about the continued prudence
of assets purchased in the past.
MR. FREDERICK:  That's actually --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You just sit on them.  You
don't even think about whether this is still a good
investment or not.  That -- that -- you think that's his
position.
MR. FREDERICK:  Well, Justice Alito, whether
that's his position anymore is of no moment to me.
That's the position of the Fourth Circuit in the David
case, the Eleventh Circuit in the Fuller case, the Ninth
Circuit in this case applying the Phillips case.  So
those are the cases that we urged as conflicts that
should be resolved in favor of a statutory construction
that says the duty to monitor and remove imprudent
investments is part of ERISA's fiduciary duty.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And if I could just ask
again, Mr. Frederick, what that duty includes in
addition to the changed circumstances situation.  In
other words, just on a continuing basis -- and tell me
in a way that includes this case but isn't limited to
this case -- on a continuing basis what is a trustee
supposed to do under the prudent person's standard?
MR. FREDERICK:  Sure.  Three things.  One,
look at the performance on a regular basis, a periodic
basis.  Number 2, look at the expenses and determine is
there a cheaper way to get the same investment for less
money that's coming out of the beneficiaries' assets.
Number 3, has there been an -- an alteration in the
management such that one ought to look further and more
deeply into it.
And at the very least, Justice Kagan, one
would think you'd look at the SEC filings for that
mutual fund to determine whether or not there had been
something that would require a -- a determination of
imprudence.  And that's not heavy lifting.
The district court here found that as to
the three funds added in 2002, the trustee had never
even called the mutual fund to say, hey, we've got
$3 billion in assets.  Do you think we could get a
better rate for the expenses charged to the
beneficiaries?  They never even asked the question.
So at the very least, you could write an
opinion that says, there's a tribal issue of fact as to
whether or not the burden was so great on the fiduciary
that it couldn't do the simple thing that the district
court already found as a matter of fact had been
breached with respect to the 2002 funds.
Now, it with respect to one of the 2002 funds,
there were two funds that were still being held by the
plan at the time of judgment.  One was added in 2002.
The other was added in 1999.  The district court, as
part of its order -- post-trial order, ordered Edison to
change the 2002 fund.  At that time, the retail share
expense ratio was 24 percent higher than the
institutional, and the district court ordered that that
be changed so that the institutional share class be
available.  As to what the '99 fund, the Alliance
Capital Appreciation Fund, the district court didn't do
that, even though the expense ratio was 37 percent
higher from the retail share to the institutional share.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I would think,
Mr. Frederick -- tell me if you disagree with this.  I
would think that it's possible that a decision to buy
one of these funds with high expenses would be imprudent
in the first place, and yet, it might be prudent not to
switch midstream.  In other words, there are costs to
switching midstream.  You have to tell everybody about
it.  I'm not sure what the costs are.
But is -- is it possible that a decision
that was imprudent in the first place, to -- to buy,
that it, nonetheless, could be true that a hold decision
is prudent?
MR. FREDERICK:  It -- it's theoretically
possible, and in the world of Supreme Court
hypotheticals, Justice Kagan, maybe there is a situation
in which that would make sense.
In the real world of investing, what we're
talking about here is economies of scale.  The only
difference between the retail share class and the
institutional share class is that the institutional
shares have more money invested in the exact same
assets.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you think both parties
agree that there is a duty, a fiduciary duty every so
often, and that's -- I don't know how often, to do some
kind of prudence review of the investments you still
hold?  You agree to that.  That's your point.
MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So I should ask the other
side if they agree to it.
MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, if they do agree to
that, my guess is that they will possibly, from what
they've read, is they're going to start arguing that the
Ninth Circuit never held to the contrary.  They are
going to say, Oh, yeah, but it wasn't clearly put to
them.
And the more I look into it, I'm not so sure
it was so clearly put, but I can't quite say whether it
was waived either.  And -- and so what should we do
about that?  Should we -- I'm pretty sure that they
didn't raise this as an objection in their reply brief
on -- in this Court, in the cert petition.
MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Breyer, this has
been waived in six different briefs that the other side
has filed.
JUSTICE BREYER:
right to make that.  Okay.
about that.
do?
MR. FREDERICK:
JUSTICE BREYER:
MR. FREDERICK:
JUSTICE BREYER:
You say they waived their
That's correct.  Now --
Let me assume you're right
And let me --
Now, still, then, what do I
MR. FREDERICK:  Okay.  What I'd like you
to --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Because I -- even if they
waived this argument, there is a problem with me
suddenly, or any of us, describing this fiduciary duty,
the nature of it, whether it's violated here or not,
when there is no real lower court opinion.
MR. FREDERICK:  There is.  That's -- that's
incorrect, Justice Breyer.  That assumption is not
correct.  If you look at Petition Appendix pages 18 and
19, there are two passages where the Ninth Circuit got
the law wrong, and we ask you to reverse and to disavow
those two passages.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So the opinion, in
your view, could be just this.  Here are the two
passages.  They said you don't have a prudence
obligation to review unless there are changes.  They are
wrong about that.  There is a prudence review.  Send it
back.
MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.  And allow
the district court to have a trial.  We lost summary
judgment.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I don't want to start
that.
MR. FREDERICK:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, they might find
there is enough to get to the trial.  I don't know about
all of that.
MR. FREDERICK:  Right.  But the two passages
start midway down page 18 of -- of the Petition Appendix
where the court said, "Characterizing the mere continued
offering of a plan option without more as a subsequent
breach would render the statute of limitation
meaningless."
That's not -- that does not take into
account the continuing duty that the fiduciary has to
periodically review and --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I am sure some -- some such
duty, but I am -- life is too short.  You're -- you're
going to ask every Federal district court not only to
determine whether a particular purchase was sensible or
not, but to say year by year whether you've done a
careful enough review.  I mean, I -- I just -- I just
don't think courts are capable of doing that.
The -- the other side offers some help by
saying if there's a changed circumstance, you've got to
do it.
MR. FREDERICK:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and you yourself
say, Oh, well, this is a very special case, because it
was obvious.  Any fool would know that there are two
classes of these stocks and the one class has a much
cheaper expense to holding it.  Why not say that
where -- where there's been a change of circumstance or
the imprudence of holding it is obvious?
MR. FREDERICK:  Well, that's putting
barnacles on the statute Congress didn't put,
Justice Scalia.  And if you take the 53 million
Americans that rely on 401(k) programs for their
retirement assets and you tell them year after year
after year you have to pay expense ratios that are much
higher than they should, you're depleting retirees'
assets in a way Congress did not envision when it
enacted the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The expense ratio is
handled -- is handled in -- in what I propose.  Where
it's obvious on its face that you -- you continue the
investment in the same company, but you -- you just get
a different class of stock and you get lower charges.
MR. FREDERICK:  Well, I don't think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's obvious.
MR. FREDERICK:  The -- it's --
Justice Scalia, there's no basis in the statutory
language for the rule.
If I could save the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Saharsky.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MS. SAHARSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I think the Court's questions today
recognize that there are ultimately two issues that will
need to be resolved in this case.  Only one of them,
though, is before the Court in the question presented.
And those two issues are:  First, whether this claim for
ongoing monitoring and failure to switch the funds is
timely; and then the second issue is, is there breach of
fiduciary duty within the limitations period.  As
Justice Kagan asked, what does the monitoring duty
entail, et cetera, et cetera.
And although I'm happy to answer questions
on that second issue, I just want to make the Court
aware that the reason it's not briefed in any kind of
extensive way is because it's not the question on which
the Court granted cert.
If I can just turn to the first question, to
look at the nature of Petitioner's claims.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's fine.  Would you
just -- just give us a hint as to whether the government
agrees with Mr. Frederick?
MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.  I mean, we filed a -- a
brief in support of him.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah.  So -- so you agree
entirely that there's no -- no particular test --
MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, let me --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- not -- not obviousness
or not change of circumstances?
MS. SAHARSKY:  Let -- let me be as concrete
as possible really, and I think there's really two
answers to your question.
Okay.  The first is the legal standard
that's in ERISA, which is the Court recognized in the
Fifth -- Fifth Third case is one that depends on what a
prudent investor would do under the circumstances then
prevailing.  That's the legal test.
But then there's a question to the second
part about how you would apply that legal test to an
on -- a claim of imprudent ongoing monitoring.  And I do
think that depends on the circumstances, but I'd like to
give the Court four data points.
The first is that the duty for ongoing
monitoring is not the same as what you would do when
initially putting the funds in place.
The second is, is that what typically
happens out in the world is that after the funds are put
in place, there is -- there are benchmarks set; and in
this case, there were the investment criteria set,
performance, expense ratios, et cetera, that would be
revisited at a periodic basis.  I think as
Justice Ginsburg pointed out, there are quarterly
meetings in this case to look at those investment
criteria, and those include performance and expenses.
The third thing is in terms of how you prove
this or how you establish it, there's a -- there's not a
checklist that can be checked in every case.  The way
that this is litigated typically, and what happened in
this case, is that an expert is on the stand and says,
Here's what I would do as a prudent investor under these
circumstances.
But then the fourth data point, which I
think is actually a very important one, is that the
ongoing monitoring duty is not limited to circumstances
in which the fund changed so much that it's like a new
fund is being put in place.  You have a duty to look on
a periodic basis and, really, how are you going to know
if there have been changes unless you looked.
And just to make it clear, the Ninth Circuit
did not say, Well, whether you should make a change or
not depends on whether the circumstances change.  The
Ninth Circuit's changed circumstances was fundamental to
its limitations ruling.  They looked at the limitations
period as running only from the initial time a new fund
is put in place.  And so what this changed circumstances
had to do with is whether there was something that
changed about the fund that made it like a new fund
being put in place.
And just one other point.  The argument that
was being made below by Respondents, and it's not clear
to me to -- to -- the extent to which they continue to
believe it, is that you have six years from when the new
fund is put in place, and that's it.  Other -- after
that, unless the fund changes so much that it's like a
new fund, these funds are basically insulated forever
from any scrutiny, which is a problem for the reason
that Mr. Frederick pointed out.
And really one of the reasons the Department
of Labor is here today is you're talking about a long
time horizon, and to say that people's investments
can -- the -- the value of their funds can really be
decreased in that way without any scrutiny is -- is
unfair.
But I'm also happy to answer questions that
the Court has.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  You started
with the first.  What was the first thing?  Remember,
you said that's the second question.  But --
MS. SAHARSKY:  Oh, yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the first question?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That you are not going to
address.  Exactly.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to hear the one you
weren't going to address.
MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes, yes.  Well, the question
that was -- to make sure I get to this, of course.  The
question that was teed up for the Court was, is there --
is -- is the fact that the funds were put in place
outside of the limitations period something that would
preclude you from bring -- bringing a case about what
happened during the limitations period.  And that's how
we listed -- the question presented was listed in the
petition.  It was the question that was presented also
in the opp.  It's the question that we presented.
No, the fact that the selection was --
happened more than six years ago does not preclude you
from bringing a monitoring claim.  Those are different.
You're not challenging the initial selection anymore.
You're challenging the ongoing monitoring.  But what the
Ninth Circuit did was really limit the claim to --
related to the initial selection.
And -- and just to be clear.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  And that's
because they have this changed circumstance rule where
it has -- the change can only be something like a new
fund?
MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.  They understood that,
and they -- they described that in the record to be like
a new fund.
And I'd just -- one other point I would like
to address is with respect --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, though.  It
seems to me that -- that you -- you're -- you're
misdescribing them when you say that they said it's only
the purchase that can be subject to scrutiny.  I -- I
think they -- they did say that the holding can be
subject to scrutiny as well so long as there has been
some change in circumstance.
MS. SAHARSKY:  The change --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, you can say that, you
know, that refers you back to a -- to a new -- new
purchase standard, but it's still -- they -- they say
that within that period, you can bring a suit.
MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  If it is the
equivalent -- the changed circumstances are the
equivalent of bringing a new fund.  The reason that I
was trying to clarify that is because I think a
person -- an ordinary person could just be talking and
say, well, should I make changes to the fund or not?  It
depends on if circumstances change.  But that's not --
the Ninth Circuit wasn't addressing that merits question
of whether they had breached the duty of prudence or
they hadn't breached the duty of prudence.  They were
limiting the claim on statute of limitations grounds
because it either had to be a fund -- a new fund being
put in place or changed circumstances that made it like
a new fund.  So that's -- that's what I meant to say and
hopefully am more clear about that.
I guess if I could just say on the first
question presented, the one that we think is before the
Court just to make clear because there is disagreement
in the circuits about this, that we essentially want the
Court to hold three things.
The first is that Plaintiffs can bring a
claim for imprudent monitoring and retention of funds
based on what happened within the limitations period.
That's timely under the statute.
The second is that the Ninth Circuit was
wrong to say that the only way the claim can be timely
is either if it's from the time of a new fund or based
on this changed circumstances that make it like a new
fund because there is an ongoing duty of prudence that
runs for the fiduciaries under the statute.  And that's
really why we got into this case at the court of appeals
stage and why we're here now is that ERISA has ongoing
fiduciary duties, and both the courts below and
Respondents were arguing against that and finding
against that below.
And then the third thing is that we think
that the Court should remand for consideration of the
merits of this.  And I know that the Court has questions
about the merits because you just wonder what need --
would need to be done for the monitoring whatever else.
But that's not a claim that was really addressed at all
below.  It wasn't something that we briefed in any kind
of detailed way before this Court or that was briefed
below because these claims were really cut off at the
outset.  So although the Court could provide some
general guidance, it is, after all, a statutory
standard.  It depends on the facts and circumstances.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So if I could just
understand that, essentially, you want us to say, look,
there is this prudent person standard.  It applies
throughout to monitor and as well as to the original
purchase, but then we're not really going to tell you
what that prudent person standard is, that we will
instead let the lower courts deal with that in -- in
considering this case.  Is that what you want?
MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.  That the courts would
need to depend on the facts and circumstances -- figure
out under the facts and circumstances whether there was
a breach of the duty of what -- based on what happened
within the limitations period.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you want us to say
that whatever it is, it isn't solely whether there's
been a change in circumstances so extreme as to amount
to purchasing a new stock.
MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.  That's right.  And
that -- that's the trust loss sources.  We say that, you
know, you have a duty to look from time to time.  You
can't just set the funds and hold them and forget about
them.  And the duty to look isn't triggered by something
external that's like a new fund being put in place.  You
just -- you have a duty to look.  And it might depend --
how often you look might depend on the circumstances,
and how deep you look might depend on the circumstances,
but you have a duty to look.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But when Mr. Frederick said
before, he said something like anything -- any periodic
review, you're going to look at the returns, you're
going to look at the expenses, and you're going to look
to see whether there's a change in the -- in the, you
know, basic nature of the company or something.  You
agree with all of that; is that right?
MS. SAHARSKY:  Yeah.  I think that's fairly
typical, and it actually was -- those were the
benchmarks that were set by the investment committee in
this case, that they had five investment criteria, and
the first of them -- the first three of them were you
always look at performance, you always look at the
expense ratio, and you look at the management of the
fund.  And actually, I think that follows from ERISA
that you need to look at both performance and expense
ratio on a regular basis because the first fiduciary
duty that's listed in Section 1104 is to -- to act for
the exclusive -- the exclusive purpose of paying
benefits and defraying the reasonable expenses of the
fund.  ERISA itself tells you to look at expenses.
If the Court has no further questions, we
would urge you to reverse and remand for a consideration
of the merits.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Hacker.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN D. HACKER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HACKER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I agree to be sure that there are no serious
differences between the parties with respect to the core
legal question on which this Court granted review.  For
that reason, it is our primary submission that the Court
ought to dismiss -- dismiss the writ as improvidently
granted rather than --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hacker, I don't know
what that means.  It seems to me when I read your brief,
that your brief is supporting the -- the Ninth Circuit's
position, which is that it's only when significant
changes occurs.
MR. HACKER:  We -- we are not supporting
that position because that's not the Ninth Circuit's
position.  I don't think the opinion can reasonably be
read that way because it wasn't the issue before the
court.  The issue before the Ninth Circuit was the same
issue that Petitioners raised -- or that the district
court addressed, which was that there's no continuing
violation theory under ERISA, i.e., you cannot bring a
claim that addresses the initial selection and says
that was imprudent --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, the district court
said more than that.  It did say there has to be a
change in circumstances.  Mr. Frederick told us -- and
you can tell us if he was wrong -- that they did not
have any opportunity in the district court to say there
should be these periodic monitorings because the court
said after the initial investment in the fund first when
you buy the plan.  After that, there's no obligation
other than if there's changed circumstances.  Then you
have to take another look.  That's what the district
court -- as I read it -- said, and that hemmed in these
Plaintiffs and they couldn't say.  We're talking not
about a continuing violation, ongoing monitoring not
necessarily triggered by a change in circumstances.
MR. HACKER:  With all due respect, Justice
Ginsburg, the district court opinion does not say that.
It cites the Phillips case on page 180, describes the
holding of Phillips.  And it says in Phillips -- this is
talking about Phillips, not this case -- it says in
Phillips, "The Court rejected the notion that after the
first alleged breach of fiduciary duty, any failure to
rectify the breach constituted another discrete breach."
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Where -- where are you
reading from?
MR. HACKER:  Page 180 of the Petition
Appendix.
"The Court" -- and it goes onto say, "The
Court said that although the trustee's conduct could be
viewed as a series of breaches, the statute of
limitations did not begin anew because each breach was
of the same character."  It's referring back to the
failure to rectify.  Nowhere in that passage and nowhere
anywhere in the district court summary judgment opinion
or at trial is there a hint or whisper of a suggestion
that the Plaintiffs would be prohibited as a matter of
law from trying a claim that says we want to challenge
the monitoring process during the repose period, and
here's the problems that we have with your monitoring
process.  Here's all the flaws we want to identify.
Here's the things we think a prudent fiduciary should
have done, and here's the things you didn't do.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Hacker, Mr. Frederick
cited Petition Appendix page 18 and 19.
MR. HACKER:  Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He said that is a
statement of the Ninth Circuit law that Petitioners
think is incorrect and that they would like to have this
Court correct.
MR. HACKER:  A couple points on that one if
I may, Your Honor.
First of all, the passage that Mr. Frederick
pointed to on page 18 says, "Characterizing the mere
continued offering of a plan option" -- and I agree with
him, the key words are the next two that follow --
"without more as a subsequent breach would render
the" -- "the statute meaningless," et cetera, et cetera.
The "without more" is clearly referring to establishing
a breach of the duty to monitor in that process.
If you don't come into court and show that
there was a problem or flaw in the monitoring process,
you can't win a claim -- a challenge to the monitoring
process.  What you don't get to do -- the Ninth Circuit
is responding to the argument they  made, which was that
we want to come into court and say we establish that the
-- that the fund was initially selected through an
imprudent process, and therefore, the fund was initially
imprudent and as long as it stayed in the plan, it was a
continuing violation.  And we don't have to talk about
the monitoring process.  And the reason --
JUSTICE ALITO:  On what point -- on what
point of law do you and Mr. Frederick now disagree?
MR. HACKER:  We certainly don't disagree on
the -- the question presented.  We disagree, I think,
and it became clearer today, with a couple of points
that Mr. Frederick made.
First of all -- and this, I think, was in
response to your question.  Mr. Frederick said that the
continuing duty to monitor and -- to go back to my point
about the dismissal of the writ.  I would be surprised
if this Court wanted to be the first to elaborate what
the duty -- duty to monitor looks like on an absent
record like this one.  But Mr. Frederick wants you to
say that the -- the duty to monitor includes a
continuing duty to look for cheaper funds.  With respect
to a fund like this when there's 40 funds in the lineup,
his theory is that on a periodic basis, whether it's
daily, or monthly, or quarterly, or annually, every time
you look at the fund, you ought to be looking at whether
or not there is a cheaper option.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I don't think --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean -- I mean, at a
higher level of -- level of abstraction than that.  Not
as applied, not the particular things that need to be
done.  He says in his reply brief, "No precise rule
dictates how often a fiduciary must review the portfolio
or how detailed periodic reviews must be.  Rather, as
with trust administration, generally, the duty to
monitor is subject to the reasonable person's standard;
that is, the fiduciary must engage in the kind of review
that a reasonable, prudent fiduciary would conduct under
the circumstances."
Do you disagree with any of that?
MR. HACKER:  Not a word of it.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Hacker, here's
what you say -- here's what you say in your brief.  What
you say in your brief is, "After the initial selection,
the fiduciary may conduct much less intensive periodic
reviews monitoring only" -- "monitoring only for
significant changes in the value and risks of the
investments."  That presents a very different view.
MR. HACKER:  That's -- that comes straight
out of trust law, because that is what the typical duty
to monitor is what you're looking for are significant
changes because, as Mr. Frederick says, and I fully
agree, how else -- I think it was Ms. Saharsky,
actually -- how else would you know if there had been
changes if you're not looking for them?
We are not suggesting -- I think
Ms. Saharsky was wrong about this.  We aren't saying,
neither Court below said in any respect --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  As I see the difference, you
say you're monitoring only for significant changes in
the value and risks of the investment, and they're
saying, look, you have this periodic duty.  One of the
things you're looking for is significant changes; but
you also, on an ongoing basis, just like ordinary people
do with their own investment portfolio, you look at the
return, you look at the expense.
In something like this, it's not like we're
scouring the whole universe for cheaper funds.  It's
like we realize, oh, look, it's the exact same fund with
cheaper expenses.  In something like this, you make the
change.
MR. HACKER:  Right.  There's three things
that I would say about that.  First of all, there was a
trial on that.  Contrary to everything you just heard,
there was a trial on whether or not they could and
should -- the fiduciaries could and should have switched
the share classes.
The court went on and on, took over the
questioning to ask whether or not that should have
happened here; and there was evidence in the record as
to why it didn't happen here.  And I can go into that
evidence.  And it was in the letter I provided to the
Court last week to show that everybody understood that
that was a claim at -- at stake.
And what happened was their expert
ultimately said, I don't think, during the regular -- he
would not endorse the proposition that during the
routine, periodic monitoring that everybody agreed our
fiduciaries conducted, that they would have caught this
kind of problem.
And as the second point, the reason is,
you're not looking in the periodic monitoring to see
whether each of the funds in the lineup is the cheapest
one available.
Now, they say it looks easy here because it
was just a different share class in the same fund, but
that's actually a different investment.  In order to
switch, you don't just press a button and switch into
the institutional-share class.  You have to sell the
institutional -- the retail-share class; buy new shares
in the retail-share class; make all of the changes with
respect to that kind of change, with respect to each
participant who is already invested in the retail-share
class.
And the evidence at trial, uncontradicted by
plaintiffs and their expert, was that that kind of
change causes disruptions that employees don't like,
which is why the monitoring process generally was
limited to looking for changes.  Now --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, really, are you
saying -- what kind of disruption could be worth, on an
ongoing basis, for people who have invested in funds for
30 and 40 years and where there's a significant
difference in fees, what kind of disruption could be
worth the price of that?
MR. HACKER:  Well, but -- but the problem
is -- and this is the third point I was going to make,
is --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why don't you answer
that one?
(Laughter.)
MR. HACKER:  Well, because it's not just --
it's -- it's oversimplifying the kind of disruption
we're talking about.  It would be easy for any one
person, if it were as simple as, oh, I understand my
investment is now cheaper today.  But that's not how it
works.  Employees don't -- the evidence -- there's
evidence on this.  I'm not just making this up.
There's record evidence that the cost of
removing and switching, there were costs that the
fiduciaries cared about.  But the key point is to think
about this:  If you're selling the institutional -- the
retail-share class to move into the retail-share class,
at that point -- and this is Mr. Frederick's own
argument.  You're supposed to be looking for cheaper
options, not just necessarily the -- the
institutional-share class.  You would have an
obligation.  If we just switched into the
institutional-share class, I -- and there was one other
option anywhere in the market that was a comparable
investment but less expensive, I assure you
Mr. Schlichter and his firm would have showed up the
next day with a lawsuit suing us for breach of the
fiduciary duty for failing to shift into the cheaper
option that was available when all we did was simply
switched to the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's -- that's the nature
or --
MS. HACKER:  -- institutional-share class.
JUSTICE BREYER:  You're talking about the
nature of the fiduciary's duty to continuously monitor.
Isn't that your subject?
I'd like before doing that, since you seem
to agree there is some such duty, but you may disagree
of what it consists of and nobody so far in the lower
courts has really gone into that, probably we should
send it back on that, say they agree about that.
But then you want it dismissed because you
say that that issue wasn't fairly raised.  All right.
So I look at the cert petitions; and in
their cert petition on page 18, 19, 20, et cetera, it
seems to me pretty clear that they're saying the mistake
in the Ninth Circuit was ignoring the continuing nature
of a trustee's duty under ERISA to review plan
investments and eliminate imprudent ones.
MS. HACKER:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  They're quoting the Seventh
Circuit.
So when I read that, they're making the
argument pretty clearly.  Add that that's -- there is
this nature, that there is this duty.  And they say the
Ninth Circuit didn't hold that.  The Ninth Circuit
thought it existed only when there was a change.
So I looked to your reply to that.
You do not, to -- to -- I can't find a place
in your reply -- in your reply to their cert petition,
in either, where you say they have an incorrect
assumption here because you should dismiss this case and
never hear it because that isn't what the Ninth Circuit
said.  Rather, the Ninth Circuit said a different thing.
Now, where -- where do you say that?  I
couldn't find it.  And if you didn't say it, it seems to
me that you have waived, in a sense, the argument that
they have waived in a different sense.
All right.  You see the point.
MR. HACKER:  Right.  We -- we definitely
argued and pointed out, which is on the face of the
opinion true, which is the next paragraph of the opinion
after the -- the "without more" cite that the court
recognized a continuing duty.  It acknowledged the
existence of a continuing duty, and this is in the --
our cert opposition and explicitly says, "Therefore, the
district court was correct to allow them to assert a
changed circumstances theory."
That's clearly in the cert opp.  On pages 8
through 10, we're explaining --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what you say, I have
this that you said.
The Ninth Circuit held that a statute --
that "a claim challenging the selection of mutual
funds" -- da, da, da -- "is barred by the six-year
statute if the claim challenges funds that were selected
more than six years before, and the claim does not
allege that any materially new circumstances arose
within the previous six years."
So that sounds like the very
characterization of the Ninth Circuit that they are
saying was mistaken.
MS. HACKER:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So it seems as if you are
agreeing that the Ninth Circuit made a mistake.  You are
agreeing they should have put this in, and I guess you
also agreed that in their brief in the Ninth Circuit,
they did say, "Edison had a continuing duty to ensure
that each of the plans' investments was and remained
prudent, was and remained prudent within the six years,"
et cetera.
So -- so they raised it in the Ninth
Circuit.  You agree the Ninth Circuit made the wrong
holding --
MS. HACKER:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and -- and you agree
what the right holding is.  All right.  So what's --
what is the argument we should dismiss it?
MR. HACKER:  Well, there are a few problems
in that, but most of them just quibbles.  Okay?
First of all, the -- the description you
read of the cert -- from the cert opposition is
describing accurately what the Ninth Circuit said with
respect to what it was they were arguing.
Remember, the changed circumstances theory
was introduced by the Plaintiffs' own expert.  When it
came into the trial, the judge expressed puzzlement as
to why the Plaintiffs were talking about changed
circumstances because he thought their claim was going
to be what you hear it is today.  And then the --
the expert disavowed --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because they thought that
was the circuit law, that they had to show changed
circumstance; otherwise, they wouldn't have a monitoring
claim.
MR. HACKER:  There was no circuit law like
that, there was no precedent saying that.  And doctor --
and this was not Plaintiffs' theory.  Plaintiff
specifically said we have a broader theory.  It appears
at page 33 of Volume 1, the first morning of the -- of
the trial.
Nelson Wolff, counsel for Plaintiffs,
explains that our theory is not limited to changed
circumstances.  That was Dr. Pomerantz's own theory.
And the court ultimately says, I will hold
the Plaintiffs to whatever Dr. Pomerantz said.
But there's an even clearer answer to this,
which is we know that the Plaintiffs did not think
themselves limited to proof of changed circumstances
because half of the trial, fully half of the trial was a
challenge to the money market fund, one of the funds at
issue below.
And the argument -- and the only argument
Plaintiffs made with respect to the money market fund
was that it was too expensive.  The money market fund
was added in 1999, and it was -- 18 basis points were
paid to the -- the -- the record keeper, the service
provider, of the money market fund.
And throughout the period, through a post
period, the money market fund stayed in the -- in the
lineup.  And the Plaintiffs' only argument at trial
which they were allowed to make -- the Court didn't
suggest there was any limit and Respondents didn't
suggest any limit -- was that it stayed too expensive.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What about this --
MS. HACKER:  They never pointed to any
changed circumstances.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- about this result?  Two
paragraphs:  The parties agree that there is this
ongoing monitoring, et cetera.  The Ninth Circuit did
say changed circumstances.  It's wrong about that.
Nobody here in the reply brief to cert
really raised the question of whether it had been
properly raised; and, therefore, we remand the case to
apply the law insofar as is in the proper procedure to
do it, something like that.
MR. HACKER:  That would -- I don't disagree
with most of that.  The only point I would make is I
don't think there's a reason to remand.
I do think the Ninth Circuit, in referring
to the continuing -- whenever you hear "continuing
duty," that doesn't mean they raised the argument.
Their point below -- quite different from what you here
in this Court today -- their point below was because
there's a continuing duty, it follows that whenever
there's a prudent fund in the -- in the plan on day 1,
it's a continuing violation as long as it stays in the
plan.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hacker, here is what you
argued to the Ninth Circuit -- what you argued to the
Ninth Circuit.  ERISA's 6-year limitations period bars
challenges to funds added to the plan more than 6 years
before this action was filed.  Then you got exactly what
you wanted from the Ninth Circuit with the single
exception that the Ninth circuit added a fact, that by
the way, that doesn't apply to changed circumstances.
Then you described to this Court what you got from the
Ninth Circuit, in the terms that Justice Breyer said,
which was exactly that the only kind of monitoring claim
available to a plaintiff is when there are changed
circumstances.
And then you file a brief in which you
sometimes say that the Ninth Circuit is completely right
and then you sometimes purport to be agreeing that the
Ninth Circuit was wrong.
Now, to me, that's raising a lot of dust for
something that is pretty clearly what the Ninth Circuit
said, what you asked for, and what is wrong?
MR. HACKER:  The last point I was going to
make, which I didn't get a chance to get back to it,
Justice Breyer, was we do think it's appropriate, if you
don't like the language that the Ninth Circuit used, if
you it don't read it the way I do, and think that the
Ninth Circuit is announcing a categorical rule that says
nobody can proceed on a monitoring challenge unless they
approve changed circumstances, that's not the argument
we believe is the correct argument.  And we do not argue
that that's required anywhere in our brief.  If you
think that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  That was -- that was --
MR. HACKER:  But if you -- if you disagree
with that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- page 22.  It's in your
summary of the argument.  “A fiduciary may conduct much
less intensive periodic reviews, monitoring only for
significant changes.”
MR. HACKER:  That's during the periodic
monitoring process.  But it can still be a breach.
We're not resisting the point Justice Scalia raised,
that if the plaintiff thinks that something was so
galactically imprudent on its face, that any proper,
reasonably prudent review process would identify and
remove the fund, then that can proceed, or at least it's
not barred by the statute of repose.  That's a
permissible type claim, because of course it's an
argument that there's been a breach of the duty of
prudence during the repose period.
It is true as a general matter, that that is
not pulled out of whole cloth.  That's straight from
trust law that, as a general matter, what you're looking
for in the periodic review process is changed
circumstances.  And that goes back to my earlier point
that it cannot be, it cannot be and you should not write
in whatever opinion you write, you should not endorse
Mr. Frederick's proposition that during the periodic
review process, you actually do have a duty to
constantly look and scour the market for more cheaper
investment options.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you certainly do, if
that's what a prudent trustee would do.
MR. HACKER:  And there's no evidence, in all
of the trust -- none of the trust law sources, zero of
them that either side cites, suggests that that's what a
prudent fiduciary would do.  If that was an argument to
be made -- that could have been made below, their expert
would have made it, because there's nothing in the
district court summary judgment opinion that precludes
it, and we know from the way they litigated the money
market fund, which was only a challenge to um -- the
continuing high fees, allegedly high fees, with
absolutely no argument by them, or suggestion that they
needed to show changed circumstances.
The whole trial was about whether or not
they could prove a breach of the duty to monitor.  We
accept that a breach of the -- a challenge to the duty
to monitor can proceed -- excuse me, an argument that
the duty to monitor was breached can proceed, but -- and
here's the key point that I think Mr. Frederick is
overlooking -- it has to be a challenge to the duty to
monitor.  It has to challenge the monitoring process
itself.  It cannot be, simply because of the continuing
duty, that it follows that you have a per se duty to
pull out a fund that should not have been selected
initially.
This is a point Justice Kagan made and she's
absolutely right about that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about just saying
that the changed circumstances seems to have confused
everybody?  The Ninth Circuit used it.  You used it
repeatedly.  This Court should X that out and then
you're in perfect harmony.
MR. HACKER:  And that was the point I was
getting to earlier.  I do agree that if the Court is
uncomfortable with the language used in the Ninth
Circuit, it obviously doesn't have to endorse that
language.  The Court can write whatever opinion it
believes is appropriate.
But we think the question really is, as a
court of review reviewing the judgment, the question is,
is the judgment incorrect.  And there's no basis for
challenging the district court judgment, and there's no
basis for challenging the Ninth Circuit's judgment
affirming that judgment.
And the analysis, what's going on in the
Ninth Circuit opinion -- again, if you don't like the
language or think it's susceptible to misunderstanding,
the point the Ninth Circuit was simply making is one I
think this Court should endorse, which is that there is
no continuing violations theory.  A plaintiff has to do
more than simply say there was an imprudent fund one
day, and because you have a continuing duty, you
therefore have to remove it.
What a plaintiff in that situation has to
show, is a violation, a breach, of the continuing duty
to monitor, so then the case becomes about what the
scope of that duty is.  And I want to make two points
where I do think there is some disagreement between us
and Mr. Frederick on that.
The first is that, and I agree with what
Ms. Saharsky said, it's absolutely true that there is a
fundamental and major difference between the process for
selecting funds initially and the process for monitoring
existing funds.  When you're selecting funds, you're
going through this comprehensive review of the market;
when you're monitoring them, you're basically looking
for changed circumstances.  That's what you're reviewing
for.
And the reason for that is the enormous
disruption, both to the fiduciaries, the enormous work a
fiduciary would have to do if literally every month or
literally every quarter -- these were periodic quarterly
reviews we did.  Every quarter you have to go through
all 40 funds and investigate to see whether that fund
was the cheapest available funds that provided the kind
of investment profile that fund provided.  And then do
it for the next fund, and then the next fund, and then
the next fund.  Every quarter.  That's the point --
that's the argument Mr. Frederick is suggesting and you
won't find any source of -- either under ERISA or trust
law or DOL guidance that endorses that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He didn't say the
cheapest fund.  He said there is a stock difference
between the retail and the institutional cost.
MR. HACKER:  Well, the only difference with
respect to the particular fund, I don't disagree, is
the -- is the fees.  But there is still a difference
between -- it's not the same thing.  As I said before,
not just pushing a button to jump into the institutional
share clause -- class.  One of the reasons for that is the
second point I want to make generally about the duty to
monitor, which I think Mr. Frederick and I fundamentally
disagree on, in answer to Justice Kagan's question I
believe was, he said it's only the most distant Supreme
Court law school hypothetical that there might ever be a
difference between the duty that a fiduciary has in the
initial selection process and the duty a fiduciary has
with respect to whether or not to remove a fund, that
that's just an imaginary kind of situation.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I don't think he said
that.  I asked a very particular question relating to
this particular fund, saying what kind of disruption --
is there any kind of disruption that would be worth the
price of holding onto a fund that is the exact same as
another fund except that it has much higher fees.  And
he said, as to that particular case, no, there wouldn't
be.
MR. HACKER:  I understood the question to be
more -- the question and the answer to be more general.
But it's even better if you talk about this specific
case because there is evidence on it, which tells you,
by the way, that there was a trial on this and they
understood they could do it.  Dave Bartel, Barbara
Decker, Marvin Tom and Daniel Esh were all witnesses
submitted by Edison, subject to cross-examination both
by plaintiff's counsel and the court who would examine
them at length.  All of them testified that with respect
to this particular type of change, the changing -- the
question by the court in particular, why couldn't you
just switch?  It seems like it's easy, why didn't you
just do it?  And reasons given were, and there was zero
contradictory evidence, was that there's participant
confusion when there's a switch, even if you might think
it's a good one, they don't like change unless there's a
performance change.  There's a stability issue um -- and
there are transition costs of any kind.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  How might a lessor of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How was there
investor confusion?  It seems to me one sentence saying,
well, we have been paying .3 percent, this is
.2 percent, that's why we're changing.  They're not
going to, you know, running out in the halls screaming
that there's confusion about that.
(Laughter.)
MR. HACKER:  But it was -- first of all,
that's contrary.  The ultimate question is answered by
the evidence in this case, but the -- and the evidence
was -- it's not just -- you know, it seems simple to us
in retrospect that this could be easily explained.  The
point is investors didn't like, excuse me, the
participants didn't like changes in the lineup.  The
union had even grieved an effort to change --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  They don't like changes.
They would rather have fees?
MR. HACKER:  No, what they care about is
performance, and this is performance --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hacker --
MR. HACKER -- fee.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- the day when you get from
your mutual funds a notice that says, by the way, you're
a preferred investor, we're switching you, it's the
exact same fund under a different name, now you don't
pay fees -- that's a red-letter day for an investor.
MR. HACKER:  But that's not how it works in
this situation.  Again, there was a trial on this.  The
plaintiff's tried to make this argument.  Their expert
could have made exactly this argument, and what he said,
he wouldn't endorse the proposition that this was the
kind of thing you would catch in periodic review,
because it's not what you're looking for.  You don't
look for less expensive options.  And I haven't heard an
argument from the other side that says as a general
matter with respect to the breach of -- with respect to
the duty to monitor, your duty is limited only to
whether or not there's a cheaper share class and you
don't actually have a duty to look for other cheaper
options.
I don't understand why that would be.  If
it's true that you have a duty as a matter of law, and
that we don't respect your fiduciary decision and
judgment because you could have switched to a cheaper
share class in the same fund, it would seem to follow,
as night follows the day, that you also would have a
duty to switch to a different fund if it's available and
provides the same investment profile --
JUSTICE ALITO:  With respect to all or some
of these funds, did the plan qualify for the
institutional shares or did it have to get a waiver from
the administrator?
MR. HACKER:  That was an issue tried at
trial.  With respect to the three funds that were added
in 2002, they had to get a waiver, but the court found,
based on expert -- this expert's testimony that they
would have gotten the waiver had they asked.  There was
not evidence with respect to these three funds because
the plaintiff's expert put on a different case.  He
wasn't making this kind of -- there was lots of
inquiries.  The court kept asking what was the
eligibility rules, couldn't you just switch as soon as
you became eligible.  But it turned out, if you look at
the transcript, which is not very long -- particular
citations I provided last week -- the plaintiff's expert
went a different way.  He wanted to put on a case that
says, I can tell you why they should have removed the
fund -- identified and removed the fund because it would
have been --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Just so I understand this,
you're saying that as to some funds, it was necessary to
get a waiver.  As to others, the record doesn't show
whether it was necessary to get a waiver or not?
MR. HACKER:  As to the three funds that
remain in the case, the record is not clear on that.
There was inquiries, the court asked about that, and
there wasn't evidence.  Because when we came to trial,
we thought the plaintiffs were arguing what
Dr. Pomerantz argued, which is that the only way we ever
would have had a duty to identify this problem -- this
is Dr. Pomerantz, their own expert's view -- was the
only way we would have had a duty to identify this
problem is if there was sufficient changes within the
funds to have triggered the full due diligence review.
JUSTICE ALITO:  This is a very big pension
plan and it seems odd that it would not have enough
funds to qualify for institutional shares.  These
institutional shares must be restricted to -- I don't
know what, the most gigantic investor in the world.
MR. HACKER:  Right.  And again, there's
evidence on this.  The point there is simply that you
don't look at the overall assets of the whole fund
because as to any one investment, you know, there might
only be a $1 million or $500,000 invested, and so,
that's the -- that's the threshold issue.
The counterpoint is the one that their
expert made, which is, yeah, but the fund can expect
that -- the mutual fund can expect greater investments.
So in my experience, he said, they'll often waive for
precisely that reason.  But that's the reason; it wasn't
like an automatic thing.  And there isn't evidence as to
what the -- what the remaining funds -- at least the
evidence was ambiguous as to what that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  That seems like a
potentially important point, but maybe it's not.  I
mean, if -- if the investment advisor can simply look at
the criteria for getting institutional shares and see that
the fund would qualify and the costs for those would be
less, then that seems like a more obvious switch to make
than if you look at the criteria and you see that you
don't qualify and you would have to inquire about
whether you could get a waiver.  Maybe in the industry,
it's well known that you can obtain a waiver, but it
seems like a somewhat different inquiry.
MR. HACKER:  But these are exactly the kinds
of things you would have a trial about.  You would have
an expert asked about that, and there would be testimony
as to whether or not a reasonably prudent fiduciary
would have the kind of process that would not only ask
all of the questions that we asked and looked at
regularly, but also would ask and add to that criteria,
is there a cheaper alternative?  And I don't think
you're going to see any case law that says, well, that
can be limited to is there a cheaper share class in the
particular fund?  The criteria would -- if it allowed
for that, would be is there a cheaper alternative.
And the reason doesn't exist is, it would be
so extraordinarily demanding on fiduciaries to
constantly, on a monthly or quarterly basis, to be
looking at the whole market to see whether there was a
cheaper share class.  That's not how anybody operates in
their own life, in their own investments, in their own
consumer purchases.
That's not the way people behave.
Particularly fiduciaries make a decision, they determine
whether it makes sense at a given time, and then they
look to see if anything's changed to make it imprudent.
It is true that if something, as I said, is so
transparently imprudent that any reasonable process
would catch it, that claim can survive the statute of
limitations.  But they had an opportunity to bring that
claim.  That was the claim that they themselves
described.  That was the claim the courts thought they
were going to bring.  But instead, they brought a claim
based on their own expert's theory that we should have
captured the problem, identified the problem and removed
the funds because of the changes within the funds that
should have triggered the full due diligence review.
Absent that, there's no requirement for that kind of
review.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Frederick, four minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:  In the their post trial
brief, they said on page 13 -- this is Docket No. 381 --
"By challenging the prudence of maintaining retail share
classes of the three name-changed funds, plaintiffs have
done what the court" -- this is the district court --
"has forbidden, by attempting to resurrect claims that
were properly held barred by the 6-year statute of
limitations."  On page 15 of the petition appendix, the
Ninth Circuit said, "These claims have been barred by
the statute of limitations."
We had argued that in our court of appeals
brief, that these are proper claims.  We raised it in
our cert petition.  There's a conflict for you to
resolve between the Second and the Seventh Circuits on
the one hand, which say that an ongoing monitoring claim
is proper under ERISA, and it resets the statute of
limitations, and the three circuits led by the Ninth,
the Fourth and the Eleventh that say you only start the
limitations period from the initial selection date.
So I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Answer his point,
however.  I mean, there's some force to his argument
that you can't have every three months, a sort of
general market evaluation of whether something should be
selected or not.
MR. FREDERICK:  And I think I disavowed
that, Justice Sotomayor.  We're not saying that every
three months the have to look at thousands of mutual
funds.  Here, there's publicly available information,
it's on the Internet, you can ask the question and
you'll get an answer, that the retail share class is
more expensive than the institutional share class.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He says your -- your
expert would not commit that a -- during a prudent
monitoring, this would have been caught.
MR. FREDERICK:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, I
think that the distortion of the record based on what
the expert testified was because the expert was
concerned about running afoul of the judge's summary
judgment order, which had said, I'm not hearing anything
about the 1999 funds unless you can tell me that the
changes were so significant that that change would
warrant a review of the type you would do from an
initial review.
Look, there are a lot of interesting fact
questions.  This Court does not need to resolve them.
All this Court needs to do and all we ask you to do, is
to rule that our claims for imprudent monitoring were
within the statute of limitations because they were
within the 6-year period.  The case should be remanded.
We lost on summary judgment.  We're entitled to go to
trial as to whether or not there are triable issues of
fact.  That's all we're asking and that's all that you
have to decide.
If you want to decide a little bit more
about what the content of this monitoring duty -- you
can say look at expenses, look at performance, look at
publicly available information --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I, for one, am not ready
to do that, because I'm not a trier of fact for what a
reasonable investor would do --
MR. FREDERICK:  I -- Justice Kennedy was
absolutely right when he said it's what a reasonably
prudent investor would do, and that's the standard.
That's all we've been arguing for and that may be
different in different circumstances --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not -- I'm very -- I
don't, as you may know, I have just a little invested so
I don't know much.  But it seems to me that in 2003,
when they were made aware of the institutional class,
that I would have looked at my portfolio and seen if I
had retail class.
MR. FREDERICK:  Well, we think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, whether it was
prudent to stay in that because of expenses or other
things, I don't know.
MR. FREDERICK:  Well, the district courts
found the case easy as to the 2002 funds, but felt
constrained as to the 1999 funds because they had been
selected before the 6-year period of the limitations.
And that's why, if this case goes back to the district
court, we believe we have a strong argument that as to
the imprudence of maintaining the 1999 funds within the
6-year limitations period, we have a strong argument.
And -- And just to take one point of fact,
Justice Sotomayor, there was a fund added in 1999, an
Allianz fund; in footnote 7 of the red brief, they say,
finally they got around to getting rid of it in 2011.
So for 10 years, the 6 years before the lawsuit was
filed starting in 2001, in 2011 beneficiaries had to
incur costs of as much as 37 percent more.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
