Stores.
Mr. Feigin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FEIGIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The payments in this case fall squarely
within FICA's definition of wages, which includes all
remuneration for employment.  Consistent with the
purpose of FICA to fund the Social Security and Medicare
programs, this Court has construed the term "employment"
broadly to encompass the entire employer-employee
relationship.
The payments here, which were paid only to
Respondent's employees and were keyed to the employees'
positions, salary levels, and length of service, clearly
were part of the employer-employee relationship.
Two particular features of the statute, I
think, make especially clear that separation-related
payments like this are covered.  First, the basic
definition of wages, both historically and currently,
has been subject to specific exclusions for certain
types of separation-related pay such as retirement pay.
Those exclusions would be unnecessary if the basic
definition of wages didn't cover separation-related
payments.
Second, one of the historical exclusions,
which was in the statute from 1939 to 1950, was for
certain types of dismissal payments.  When Congress
eliminated the exception for certain types of dismissal
payments in 1950, the accompanying House report made
clear what would already have been in any event implicit
in the repeal itself, which is that from that point
forward, all dismissal payments, which were -- Congress
understood in the House report to include any payment on
account of an employee's involuntary separation, would
be considered wages under FICA.
Respondent's reliance in this case on
Section 3402(o) is misplaced.  Section 3402(o) is a
substantive rule of income tax withholding, but is
expressly limited in its effect to Chapter 24, which is
the income tax withholding chapter, and related
procedural provisions.  It has no bearing on the
definition of wages for purposes of FICA.  In any
event --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, don't we have a
decision that says that the -- the term "wages" should
be interpreted the same way for FICA purposes and income
tax?
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, two points about that,
Your Honor.  First of all, nothing in this Court's
decision in Rowan suggests that this Court or any court
needs to look to substantive rules of income tax
withholding to determine the basic definition of wages
for purposes of FICA.
I think it's clear from the preamble to
Section 3402(o) that Congress was focused on Chapter 24
and was trying to solve a specific problem within
Chapter 24, the income tax withholding chapter, and it
didn't intend to send essentially shock waves through
the Internal Revenue Code that would affect the
definition of wages in other chapters.
Second, Respondent's view, I think, would
undercut the basic principle animating Rowan, which is
the idea that the definitions of wages should be
congruent for purposes of administrability.
Respondent's reading, which would say that none of the
payments specified in Section 3402(o)(2)(a) can possibly
be considered wages for FICA purposes, but nevertheless
must be treated as wages for withholding purposes, would
require employers to keep separate track of wages for
the two different purposes and report them separately
when they do W-2 forms for the employees or their own
941 tax returns.
Now, Respondents have conceded that Section
3402(o) did not modify the preexisting definition of
"wages" under either FICA or the income tax withholding
chapter.  Instead, their argument seems to be that the
definition of "wages" in FICA, even before Section
3402(o) was enacted, contained a hole precisely the size
and shape of the definition of supplemental unemployment
compensation benefits that Congress later codified in
Section 3402(o)(2)(a).
Now, they haven't pointed to a single
statutory provision, regulation, or revenue ruling that
would have given Congress that view.  There is simply no
reason to believe that that hole existed before the
enactment of Section 3402(o) and its common ground that
it doesn't exist after Section 3402(o).
It's also important to understand why
Congress enacted Section 3402(o).  Congress enacted
Section 3402(o) in response to a suggestion by the
Treasury Department in 1969 that there was a problem
with supplemental unemployment benefit payments.
"Supplemental unemployment benefit payments" was a term
that the IRS itself had used in a series of revenue
rulings that considered certain payments by employers
that were intended to supplement State unemployment
compensation benefits, and the IRS in those rulings had
determined that those benefits were not wages.
Now, the IRS in 1969 informed Congress that
because these benefits were considered non-wages, it was
creating a problem, namely, that income taxes weren't
being withheld and the recipients of the payments were
receiving large income tax bills at the end of the year.
Congress enacted Section 3402(o) to address
that specific problem.  It did not intend to modify the
definition of wages.  It -- nothing in the Section
3402(o) can be taken as a commentary on the definition
of wages that was enacted --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Either then or now, were
the supplemental unemployment benefit payments subject
to FICA withholding or are they now exempt under the
present --
MR. FEIGIN:  So supplemental unemployment
benefits, as defined by the IRS in its revenue rulings,
were subject neither to withholding nor to taxation
under FICA.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And after (o) was passed?
MR. FEIGIN:  After (o) was passed, those
wages --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's obviously subject to
Federal income tax withholding.  What about FICA?
MR. FEIGIN:  They still were not subject to
FICA tax.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay.  And is that still
true now?
MR. FEIGIN:  That's still true now under the
current revenue ruling, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why -- I might have
missed a step here.  Why were they getting big tax bills
if they're not wages?
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, they were still
considered to be income under the revenue rulings.  So
the effect of that was that they were receiving
pavements during the year that were considered income
and as to which they would owe income tax, but the
income tax wasn't being regularly withheld as -- as it
is supposed to be on wages, and therefore at the end of
the year, they'd receive a large income tax bill for
those payments.
If the Court has no further questions, I'll
reserve the balance --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I have a question about
the effect of the government's position.
In the States, if these -- if we say these
benefits qualify as wages for FICA purposes, then what
about the States that say we will supply unemployment
compensation only if there is not another source of
unemployment compensation?
MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, if the Court adopts
the government's position in this case, there's not
going to be any change in the States because the
government's position is the status quo.
Now, there are certain States that do look
to the Federal definition of "wages" in order to
determine whether an individual qualifies for
unemployment benefits under State law.  And if the Court
were to reach some other conclusion in this case than
the one the -- the government is urging, it is possible
that there could be some effect in those States on
qualification for State unemployment benefits.
But since State unemployment benefit
qualification is largely a matter of State law, the
States could adjust to that however they saw fit.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it ever to the
long-term advantage to the employee to have FICA
withholding, so that the employee's account is greater
and the benefits are greater?
MR. FEIGIN:  So for -- certain employees may
want that -- certain payments to count as wages because
the definition of "wages" for FICA purposes is identical
to the definition of "wages" under the Social Security
Act.  And under the Social Security Act, the accrual of
benefits is based on -- on wages.  So some employees may
want to have earned more wages.
However, in this case, they're not making
that argument.  They're simply arguing that they
shouldn't have to pay taxes on these payments which were
made, again, only to employees, were keyed to the
employees' positions, salaries and length of service and
clearly meet FICA's definition of "wages."
If the Court has no further questions,
I'll --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the payments were
not keyed to the length of service and to salary?  It
was just a flat severance payment.
MR. FEIGIN:  We still think that would meet
the basic definition of "wages" under FICA, Your Honor,
and would still count as wages and be taxable under
FICA.  I think this case is even easier than that
because the payments were clearly keyed to critical
aspects of the employment relationship.
Indeed, in the case of the post-petition
payments, the payments were expressly conditioned on the
employee's willingness to remain performing services for
Respondents during the pendency of the bankruptcy
proceedings.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in the Coffy case, the
Court drew a distinction between compensation for
services and payments that are contingent on the
employee's being thrown out of work.  But that -- why
doesn't that apply here?
MR. FEIGIN:  So Coffy was addressing not
FICA, but a statute that dealt with veterans' rights
returning to work after a period of military service.
As construed by this Court, that statute drew a
distinction between a reward for length of service, to
which the returning veteran was entitled, and short-term
compensation for services rendered to which the
returning benefit -- returning veteran -- excuse me --
was not entitled.
Now, that distinction doesn't exist under
FICA.  Even if a particular payment is considered a
reward for length of service, as this Court held that
the payments in Coffy were, it would still be
remuneration for services under FICA's definition of
wages.
For example, if you were to give an employee
an award after 20 years of service, that would clearly
be a reward for length of service and would qualify as
such under Coffy, but would not be remuneration for
employment.
Now, the specific question you asked,
Justice Alito, about the difference between payments
that are part of the continuing employment and payments
that occur at the end of the employment relationship, is
also not a distinction that FICA draws.
As I said earlier, there are a number of
historical and current exclusions for certain types of
payments that are triggered by the end of the employment
relationship.  For example, from 1954 to 1983 the
statute expressly excluded retirement pay.  I don't
think there is a reasonable reading of the basic
definition of "wages" under FICA that would include
retirement pay but exclude severance payments.
And again, I think it's very pertinent here,
and probably the best piece of evidence we have in this
case about congressional intent, that Congress from 1939
to 1950 excluded from the basic definition of "wages" in
FICA certain types of dismissal payments, by which it
meant payments on account of involuntary separation; and
then it eliminated that exclusion in 1950, making clear
both as a statutory matter and it's clear in the
legislative history that such payments, that is payments
on account of involuntary separation, would from that
point forward be covered as wages under FICA.
If the Court has no further questions, I
will reserve my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Hertzberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. HERTZBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HERTZBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The Government -- the Government agrees that
some SUB payments are not wages.  Where the dispute lies
is what SUB payments are covered by FICA and which are
not.  If the payments meet the definition of SUB payment
under the statute, then they are not wages and not
subject to FICA.  The Government's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What are you saying, "SUB
payments"?
MR. HERTZBERG:  Supplemental unemployment
benefits.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not hip.
MR. HERTZBERG:  The Government says they are
now wages if they meet the definition as they
particularly see it in a particular revenue ruling that
they issue at some point in time; and that's where the
dispute lies.
It is our position that SUB payments is not
remuneration for services because it is contingent, as
indicated previously on the Coffy case, upon losing your
job.
There is a problem on the public policy
issue that the Government is telling the Court today,
and the problem is if what they say is SUB pay is tied
to State unemployment benefits, then it is not wages and
subject to FICA.  They say if it's -- if you receive
supplemental unemployment benefits but you do not
receive State unemployment, then it is subject to FICA
taxes and is wages.
So, what they are saying to the Court is if
you have the ability to receive both the supplemental
unemployment benefits and the State unemployment
benefits, then we are not going to tax you with FICA
taxes, but if you only receive less, being just the
supplemental unemployment benefits, then it is going to
be wages and then it's going to be subject to FICA
taxes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you win at all if I
think their regulation is irrational and contrary to the
statute?
MR. HERTZBERG:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know that's not before
us, but --
MR. HERTZBERG:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- how do you win,
assuming I just say I don't pay any attention to the
regulation?
MR. HERTZBERG:  Your Honor, it's our
position that the statute is clear.  When you look at
the definition of "wages" under the FICA statute and the
withholding statute, they are almost identical.  And if
you look at the Rowan case, the Rowan case says that you
should read the statutes consistently for ease of
administration.  It is clear --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't it easier to
withhold taxes on both?
MR. HERTZBERG:  Pardon me?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't it easier to
withhold taxes on both?
MR. HERTZBERG:  Well, what they are
withholding on the withholding is income taxes.  They
are not withholding wages.  And that's why -- because it
doesn't fit the definition of wages.  If you look at
3121, which is the FICA statute, supplemental
unemployment benefit is not remuneration for services.
They're only --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If it is treated for
income tax purposes as wages, why shouldn't it be
treated for FICA tax purposes?
MR. HERTZBERG:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What your are saying is
on the income side they are treated as wages; on the
FICA side they're not treated as wages.
MR. HERTZBERG:  Your Honor, supplemental
unemployment benefits are provided to an individual to
provide a safety net when they lose their job, to cover
them during the period while they seek new employment.
To then tax the individual with FICA taxes doesn't make
sense, because you are taking away the money that the
individual needs as a safety net; and to take money away
in order to provide for the funding of Medicare or
Social Security doesn't make sense.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why are they giving them
the money, just out of love?  I mean, they don't give it
to me when I retire.  They only give it to their
employees when they retire.  What -- what are they
paying them for?  Aren't they paying them for faithful
and good past services?
MR. HERTZBERG:
they're --
JUSTICE SCALIA:
just being generous?
No, what they're doing is
No, they are -- they are
MR. HERTZBERG:  They are putting in place a
plan in order to protect the employee in the event of a
layoff or a plant closing.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why don't they do that for
me?
MR. HERTZBERG:  I don't know, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There are some severance
payments that do count for FICA purposes, isn't that so?
MR. HERTZBERG:  Your Honor, "severance" is a
generic term, but payments such as dismissal payments,
some are treated as wages for FICA purposes; but we
believe the definition is different for supplemental
unemployment benefits.  Under -- dismissal payments are
for involuntary termination.
It can be because of a firing or a
cancellation of an employment contract, where
supplemental unemployment benefits are based upon a plan
and are given to an individual because of a plant
closing or a layoff.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if Section 3402(o) did
not exist?  Would these severance payments fall within
FICA's definition of wages then?
MR. HERTZBERG:  No.  And the --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And why not?
MR. HERTZBERG:  The reason is that because,
if you look at how they are treated, even the Government
acknowledges that some supplemental unemployment
benefits are not wages.  And if you look as far back as
1960, when 501(c)(17) was enacted dealing with trusts
and their exemption from the taxes, the definition of
"supplemental unemployment benefits" has always had its
own definition.
And it's always been treated -- in 1977, for
example, the revenue ruling that the Government issued
said that supplemental unemployment benefits of any kind
are not -- are not -- wages and subject to FICA.
In 1986 Congress reenacted the withholding
statute and the FICA statute with the knowledge that
1977 revenue ruling was in place; and therefore, it's
presumed that FICA taxes are not -- or that supplemental
unemployment benefits are not subject to FICA taxes.
The Government has stipulated that the
payments made in this case to the Quality Stores
employees met the definition of supplemental
unemployment benefits.  And as I began to indicate, the
Rowan case said that you should read statutes
consistently and for ease of administration.
When you look at 3121, being the FICA
statute, along with 3401, the definition of "wages" is
almost identical.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It is, but it -- really, if
you have anything -- the definition is very broad.  I
mean, it says "'wages' means all remuneration for
employment."  All remuneration -- wages means all
remuneration for employment paid basically for any
service of whatever nature performed by an employee.
Now, I agree with you that it's the same
definition for the withholding.  But Congress, it passes
the withholding change with conflicting interpretations.
So it wouldn't be the first time that Congress passed a
statute to say:  We don't care what the conflicting
interpretations are; ignoring that, you are going to
withhold this money, period.  And it said, whether it's
other than wages or not.
I grant you, they might have thought they
had to pass it, but so?
MR. HERTZBERG:  Well, if SUB --
JUSTICE BREYER:  We could also look at it as
they didn't have to pass it.  It was subject to
withholding anyway.
MR. HERTZBERG:  If SUB pay was wages, there
would have been no need to pass 3402.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, no, there would have
been a need, if different people think different things.
So you want to be sure.
MR. HERTZBERG:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, Congress does that
quite a lot.  It -- it -- on certain, different people
tell them different things.  They say, we don't care; do
it anyway.  And that's what this statute basically says:
Withhold anyway.
MR. HERTZBERG:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And maybe -- could we say
that?  Could we say, well, in our opinion you are right.
Both statutes cover supplemental unemployment benefits.
It's never come up in the other context since this
because Congress wanted to be sure it was withheld.
MR. HERTZBERG:  I don't think you can, based
upon when you look at what the statute says, 3402(o).
It says that they should be treated as if they are
wages.
If they were already wages, there would have
been no necessity of treating them if they were wages.
If you also look at the title of the section, it says
"other than wages."  It's clear that if it was wages,
they wouldn't use the word "other than wages."
And if you look at the legislative history
also, it says in three different places that they're not
wages and also indicates it's not remuneration for
services.
So the reason that 3402(o) was enacted was
because of the 1968 Treasury regulation that had the
reporting of supplemental unemployment benefits on a
1099 form.  That's clearly not a wage form.  If it's
wages, you report on a W-2.  So there would have been no
need for enactment of 3402(o) if they were already
wages.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could you review again,
what is -- what is the relevant distinction between
dismissal payments that are subject to FICA and payments
that are not?
MR. HERTZBERG:  Your Honor, dismissal
payments are involuntary termination.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It has to be involuntary?
MR. HERTZBERG:  Yes.  And there -- and that
also is the beginning part of when you look at SUB
payments.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And SUB payments are all
voluntary?
MR. HERTZBERG:  All involuntary
terminations.  But that's where they differ at that
point.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You -- well, you told me
that the dismissal payments are involuntary.  How about
the supplemental?  Are they ever and always voluntary?
MR. HERTZBERG:  No, they're -- they're
involuntary payments, also, or based upon involuntary
termination.  The difference is supplemental
unemployment benefits are paid pursuant to a plan, and
they are also based upon a layoff or a plant closing.
And a dismissal payment, for example, which
is a separate category, and treated separately in the
Treasury regulations, is an involuntary termination.
And that's where it ends.  And it can be based upon a
loss of employment through a firing or a cancellation of
a contract.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll take it that you're
right, that the Congress that passed the withholding statute
thought it fell outside of the definition of wages, but
they were wrong.
Now, that wouldn't be the first time either.
So -- but Congress did think it.  So what weight am I
supposed to give to what Congress thought then about
what an earlier Congress, namely, the Congress that
passed the wage definition in the withholding statute
thought?
MR. HERTZBERG:  You should give it, Your
Honor, a lot of weight.  And the reason you should is
because in 1986, the withholding and the FICA statutes
were reenacted in full, including 3402(o).  And at that
point in time, there was a revenue ruling in place that
said that all supplemental unemployment benefits are not
wages and not subject to FICA.
And under the legislative reenactment,
Congress would have been presumed to have been aware of
that revenue ruling that was in place.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, yes.  But that was so
much the more so, you see?  They had authority saying it
wasn't wages.  That doesn't mean that authority was
correct.  And -- and so that's why they passed the
statute.
MR. HERTZBERG:  But what the important
aspect is, is that it's not remuneration for services.
In the Coffy case, which was not directly dealing with
whether it was remuneration or not, indicated that
supplemental unemployment benefits are given to an
individual because of the loss of a job.
And as I indicated in the -- even the
government has indicated that some supplemental
unemployment benefits are not wages and subject to FICA.
Where we differ is, is that we say all of
them are not wages and not subject to FICA.  What the
government says is, no, we'll issue a revenue ruling and
we flip flopped our position several times on the
different revenue rulings, but whatever revenue ruling
we happen to issue at this point in time will determine
whether the supplemental unemployment benefits qualify
as wages for FICA purposes or are not wages.
It's our position that the statute is clear.
When you look at it, especially in light of 3402(o),
and -- because there would have been no reason for
enactment of that section if supplemental unemployment
benefits were wages already, because they would have
been subject to FICA.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the government
explains 3402(o) on the ground that there had been prior
admin -- IRS administrative decisions exempting certain
types of SUB payments from the definition of wages.  And
that -- that can explain that language.  The language
that they are -- that SUB payments are to be treated as
if they were wages doesn't necessarily mean that all of
those SUB payments are not wages.
It does necessarily mean that at least some
of them -- or suggests at least some of them are not
wages.  So what's wrong with the government's
explanation of the language along those lines.
MR. HERTZBERG:  Because I think the language
is clear.  And the language is clear because it says --
in the title, it says "other than wages."  If any of
them were wages, they wouldn't have used the word "other
than wages."  But looking at the statute itself and
using the traditional tools of statutory interpretation,
it says in the statute that they are to be treated as if
they were wages.  If they were already wages, there'd
have been no need for the statute.
And the legislative history shows us what
Congress was thinking at that point in time, because it
says in three different places, these are not wages and
also it indicates it's not remuneration for services.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was the earlier statute
definition of wages for tax purposes, was that reenacted
at the same time?
MR. HERTZBERG:  Yes, in 1986.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you really have -- you
call into play the principle that you should interpret a
statute to make sense and not interpret any provision to
be superfluous, right?
MR. HERTZBERG:  Correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you say that the
government's interpretation renders (o) superfluous.
MR. HERTZBERG:  Absolutely, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We'll ask him about that.
MR. HERTZBERG:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Feigin, 18 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FEIGIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
I first want to address Justice Sotomayor's
question.  Justice Sotomayor, if you believe that the
revenue rulings that the IRS has issued are irrational
or invalid, the only colorable reason for believing that
is because the payments that those revenue rulings
classify as non-wages are clearly wages under FICA's
basic definition.
And if you believe the revenue rulings are
invalid for that reason, then that is all the more
reason to rule for the government here, because
Respondent's position would create an even bigger hole
in the statute that would classify even more payments as
non-wages and is even less consistent with the statute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You were touching at
what I was thinking.  Why don't you answer
Justice Scalia's point.  Why is (o) not superfluous?
MR. FEIGIN:  So, Your Honor, we acknowledge
that the revenue rulings are not consistent with the
statutory text of FICA.  The revenue rulings accept
certain payments from classification as wages that the
plain text of FICA unambiguously classify as wages.  The
revenue rulings are a continuation of a practice that
began in the 1950s and '60s, which was a somewhat more
freewheeling time in the history of statutory
interpretation.
And to the extent the IRS would defend these
in a case in which they're challenged in court, it would
not be because they're consistent with the text of the
statute, but simply because Congress has taken the
revenue rulings as a given and passed statutes that
effectively assumed that the revenue rulings are being
effective, as Justice Breyer pointed out.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have to acknowledge,
though, that if you read -- if you read the two sections
of the statute together, the one seems to be
unnecessary.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, a couple points on that,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Wages" means all
remuneration, including cash value of all remuneration,
including benefits.  And then (o) says "extension of
withholding of certain payments other than wages.  For
purposes of this chapter, any supplemental and
unemployment compensation benefit paid to an individual
shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages,"
suggesting that it really isn't.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, first, just to pick up on
the textual point --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, there would have
been a way to fix the revenue rulings without doing it
this way.  Couldn't they have done it some other way
without enacting a statute that contradicted itself?
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, first of all, Your Honor,
just to pick up on the textual point that Justice Alito,
I think, was adverting to earlier.  Saying that
particular types of payments shall be treated as if they
were wages made during a payroll period doesn't mean
that it's categorically impossible for such payments to
have qualified as wages to begin with.
As Judge Bryson pointed out in the -- his
opinion to the Federal Circuit in the CSX case, which is
cited in our briefs, if you were to say to treat all men
as if they were 6 feet tall, that wouldn't mean that no
man could possibly be 6 feet tall.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, unless it was in a
section that said how to treat men who are not 6 feet
tall.  The title of this section (o), "extension of
withholding to certain payments other than wages."
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, your Honor, it says --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, it -- it clearly
suggests that these are not wages.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, first of all, Your Honor,
it says, "certain payments other than wages."  Second, I
would point you to the part where it says, "treated as
wages for a payroll period."
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. FEIGIN:  And that actually has some
significance in that it allows the employer to treat
these as wages paid during the employer's normal payroll
period, so the withholding can be performed in the same
way that the employee would have withheld for normal
payroll period payment and avoids the need to apply the
rules that would govern in circumstances where payments
are made outside of a payroll period.
And these are payments that could well have
been made outside a normal payroll period, but this
directs that they be treated as payments within a
payroll period.
I would again point the Court back to the
historical reason why 3402(o) exists.  It was enacted,
as I discussed earlier, following a suggestion by the
Treasury Department that there was a particular problem
with withholding that needed to be solved.
Now, Justice Scalia, I suppose Congress
might have solved that problem in different ways, but I
think what Congress did here is it simply tried to solve
the problem once and for all.  It just declared that
these payments should be treated as if they were wages
so that withholding would occur, thereby solving the
problem that the IRS identified.
And it enacted a definition of supplemental
unemployment compensation benefits that everyone agrees
is broader than the set of payments that the revenue
rulings up to that point had accepted.  And there are a
couple of very good reasons Congress would have done it
that way.
One is that, because of the IRS's
case-specific approach to each of its revenue rulings,
it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for
Congress to craft statutory language that precisely
captured the contours of the payments that the IRS
either was treating or might later treat as non-wages.
Second, again, the supplemental unemployment
benefit plans that had evolved in the 1950s continued to
evolve and take different forms.  And I think the IRS
just wanted to hedge against the possibility -- excuse
me.  Congress wanted to hedge against the possibility
that the IRS might later decide that a plan structured
slightly differently from any plan that it had
considered before should also be considered nonwages.
And there was absolutely no downside to
Congress writing the definition in 3402(o)(ii)(a) more
broadly than the IRS rulings had thus far had an
opportunity to construe.
That's because, again as the Federal Circuit
pointed out, there is no practical harm done if you
treat -- if you are instructed to treat a particular
payment as wages and that payment already is wages.
Now, Your Honor, to your point about
surplusage, first of all, I don't think the canon
against surplusage would help you construe FICA here
because I think FICA is unambiguous.
I do not think there is any way to read the
definition, "remuneration for employment," considering
that it clearly includes separation-related payments, as
somehow again having a hole that is precisely the size
and shape of Section 3402(o)(2)(a).
In any event, the only way this would be
superfluous is if some court were to hold, on an issue
that is not presented to the Court in this case, that
the IRS has absolutely no administrative authority to
craft administrative exceptions to the definition of
wages for policy reasons, as it did in the revenue
rulings that underlie the enactment of Section 3402(o)
here.
If a court were to reach that conclusion,
then Section 3402(o) might not have any operative
effect.  But Congress in 1969 clearly could not have
believed that the revenue rulings were ineffective or it
never would have enacted Section 3402(o) in the first
place.  There's no other reason Congress could have
thought that certain types of supplemental unemployment
benefits were excepted from the definition of "wages."
My friend on the other side mentioned these
1968 regulations.  Those regulations only applied to
payments from trusts.  They didn't apply to payments,
like the payments at issue in this case, that come
directly from the employer.  Those regulations did not
purport to construe the definition of "wages" in either
FICA or the income tax withholding statutes.  And in
fact, since 1957 there has been an income tax
withholding regulation that specifically says that any
payment on account of an employee's involuntary
separation does constitute wages for withholding
purposes.  And Congress was presumably aware of that
regulation.
And again, I would just like to address one
final point.  I think opposing counsel's argument about
this 1986 reenactment doesn't make a great deal of
sense.  I think the argument is that when Congress
reenacted the statute in 1986 it was somehow adopting
the then-current interpretation of the IRS in a 1977
revenue ruling.
I don't think that the enactment of Section
3402(o) originally in 1969 can be taken to have left the
IRS with sufficient flexibility to change its practices
during the 1970s, but that the reenactment of that very
same language in 1986 would be taken to freeze for all
time and -- the current IRS practices and foreclose the
IRS from ever modifying those practices in the future.
Finally, Respondents point to the
legislative history of 3402(o), which does contain some
statements that supplemental unemployment compensation
benefits aren't wages.  I think some of the reason for
that legislative history is confusion about the
nomenclature.
There were "supplemental unemployment
compensation benefits," which was a statutory term, and
"supplemental unemployment benefits," which was the term
the IRS used.  I think it is clear that Congress must
have been looking at the IRS revenue rulings, again
because there is simply nothing else that could have
possibly given the IRS the impression that any of these
types of payments weren't wages to begin with.
And I think it's very important that the
Court not just look at the legislative history
piecemeal, but look at the entire historical backdrop if
it decides to get into any of that at all.  But we think
this case is very easily resolved on the plain text of
FICA, which clearly includes these payments.
We don't even think there is a need to look
at Section 3402(o), which is limited in effect to the
income tax withholding provisions and was enacted to
solve a specific income tax withholding-related problem
and not to affect FICA's basic definition of wages.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about that we should
just ignore their revenue rulings, including the current
one, and just deal with the statute?  Is that what you
are suggesting?
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, the revenue rulings
aren't directly at issue in this case, Your Honor,
because all the revenue rulings do is specify that
certain payments -- not the type of payments that are
issued in this case -- are not wages.
And nobody contends that the revenue rulings
have any effect or any special bearing on this case,
because this is a case about payments that both the IRS
in its revenue rulings and Congress under the plain text
of FICA would classify as wages.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I think part
of the -- the point is that the broad, capacious
definition of "wages" at least doesn't seem as broad to
the IRS since they are carving things out, maybe not
willy-nilly, but at least they don't seem that it's as
broad as you do -- they don't seem to think that it's as
broad as you do.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, two points to that, Your
Honor.  First, again, these exceptions first came into
existence in the 1950s and 1960s, and I quite candidly
don't think the IRS was as careful about fidelity to
text as a modern legal observer would be.
Second, if this Court were to believe that,
notwithstanding the fact that the IRS's revenue rulings
aren’t directly at issue in this case for the reasons I
said to Justice Ginsburg, if this Court believes that it
cannot rule for the Government in this case on the
statutory question without concluding that the revenue
rulings are invalid, we still think the Court should
rule for the Government on the statutory question.
We think the statutory text is clear, and
that is the IRS's position notwithstanding the revenue
rulings.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And then what happens to
the State compensation schemes which the revenue rulings
seem to have been trying to accommodate?
MR. FEIGIN:  So if this Court were to
conclude that the Government is correct on a -- as a
statutory matter, but we're to make clear that
revenue -- the current revenue ruling, Revenue Ruling
90-72 was invalid, that might have some effect on
individuals' eligibility for unemployment benefits under
State law in those States that incorporate the Federal
definition of wages as part of the calculation for
eligibility for State unemployment benefits.
If that creates any bad results, States will
be able to fix them, and I don't think that it should
preclude this Court from holding what the plain text of
FICA I think in this case requires.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
