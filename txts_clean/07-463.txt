CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

Institute.
Mr. Kneedler.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit's affirmance of a
nationwide injunction in this case is contrary to
bedrock principles of Article III standing, of the
availability and scope of judicial review under the
Administrative Procedure Act, and the granting of
equitable relief. As this case was decided by the
district court and as it comes to this Court, it
involves a stand-alone challenge to two regulations that
govern the procedures to be followed by the Forest
Service in deciding whether to approve individual
site-specific activities in national forests.
The two regulations provide that
site-specific actions that are excluded from either an
environmental impact requirement or even an EA under
NEPA are also not subject to special noticing and
comment and administrative appeal provisions applicable
to the Forest Service. The Ninth Circuit sustained the
district court's nationwide injunction as to those
procedural regulations standing alone, not as part of a
challenge to a specific site-specific activity.
The court did so, moreover, on the basis of
an affidavit from one member of one of the organizations
who could not begin to establish standing under this
Court's decisions by showing an imminent injury by
virtue of harm to a site-specific activity; and the
Court affirmed the nationwide injunction applicable to
all forests with respect to all projects listed in ten
categories identified by the district court, including
national forests and projects that don't even -- that
are not even included within that one declarant's
generalized interests in certain natural forests.
For the multiple combination -- combination
of multiple reasons, we think the Ninth Circuit's
decision cannot stand.
First, as with respect to standing, the one
declaration on which both the district court and the
court of appeals rely is the declaration of Mr. Bensman,
which is reproduced in the petition appendix. And on
page 70A and 71A are the only allegations of -- that go
to injury at all with respect to the particular
regulations at issue here from paragraph 15 on to -- the
bottom of 71A on, those are allegations concerning other
regulations that are no longer at issue.
JUSTICE BREYER: Standing itself, I mean,
it's a little unusual. Suppose -- I mean, Congress here
has passed a statute and the statute specifically aims
at a class of litigants. And it says to the class of
litigants, if you are a member of it, we are telling you
what we want the agency to do and that is to promulgate
a certain appeal procedure.
Now, if you are a member of the class that
frequently litigates and you frequently take advantage
of that procedure, why aren't you heard as a litigant,
at least enough for Article III? And we know as far as
prudential standing is concerned, Congress wanted to
give you standing, so I think would it take care of
that.
Are you saying no matter -- that just normal
litigants in the courts who reappear time and time again
in certain kinds of cases, don't have standing to
challenge a procedural rule, if Congress under Article
III and Congress specifically tells them they can?
MR. KNEEDLER: Congress has not specifically
said that they may challenge --
JUSTICE BREYER: Let's imagine that Congress
did, Congress did say: By the way, lawyers who have
handled 17 tort cases in the last year where the value
has been more than $500,000 and who will sign an
affidavit saying they intend to continue in that branch
may appeal from the court's promulgation of the
following general rule, dah, dah, dah. And that
Constitution prohibits Congress from doing that?
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, first of all, I don't
think it could be lawyers. It has to be a party.
JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Those who -- fine,
forget that, yeah.
MR. KNEEDLER: I think there would be
substantial doubt that Congress could do that, because
let me explain why, and this goes to a point that
Justice Scalia was making in the prior argument.
Procedural wrong is not Article III injury.
The injury in this case comes from the application of
the regulation in a specific site-specific --
JUSTICE BREYER: You mean Article III and at
Westminster -- at Westminster, when Westminster,
whatever they had, they must have had some procedural
rules, and sometimes they had general procedural
rules -- I don't know what the history is; I could look
it up. But I would be amazed if the lawyers at that
time or the clients who had certain cases were not
permitted to challenge those rules as contrary to some
other rules.
Do we know the answer to that?
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, if -- if Congress --
JUSTICE SCALIA: In a particular case, I
suppose.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. Generally.
Because you have a special procedure, here's what you
can generally challenge our rules.
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, if I could make, again,
several points. Congress has not passed such a statute.
And there may be room in particular situations for
Congress to pass a special statute that would identify
particular interests that could then be taken into
account in terms of whether Article III standing would
be established.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, then your answer is,
if Congress says you can do it, have a general
challenge to people who generally appear, your answer is
if Congress says they could do it, Article III doesn't
stop them?
MR. KNEEDLER: No, I -- what I said, that
would be a different question.
JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. What's the answer to
that different question?
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it might depend on a
particular -- it might depend on a particular case. In
the Whitman case the court says that the statutes
providing for direct review of regulations eliminate
prudential limitations on ripeness in that case, but
they wouldn't eliminate the bedrock principle of
standing. It would be necessary to show a threatened
injury. Now, it --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Kneedler, don't we have
to assess the need for -- for showing a specific
threatened injury on a -- on a somewhat elastic standard
in a case like this? Because the claim is made on the
other side that if we do not allow, if we do not find
standing to challenge the regulation per se, there are
going to be a number of specific instances which in
practical terms can never be challenged when that
regulation is applied.
There were one or two instances, as I
recall, of cases in which on your theory there could be
no challenge because the announcement of the action was
made on the very date that the action was taken. So
that if we do not find sufficient elasticity and
standing to allow a challenge to the regulation on
behalf of people of the sort that Justice Breyer
described, there will, in fact, be a preclusion of any
challenge to a lot of specific actions.
What's your answer to that?
MR. KNEEDLER: Several answers if I may. In
the declaration on which standing was based in this
case, that claim is not made. And that is the only
declaration that was made -- that was submitted before
the district court entered its judgment. There was an
argument made like that after, after the fact.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Assume for the sake of
argument that it is made in this case.
MR. KNEEDLER: Okay. Then --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What should you respond?
MR. KNEEDLER: It is conceivable in a
particular case that a person who -- who claims to be
injured by that could sue to prevent that injury, but it
would not be a challenge to the regulation as
regulation. It would be because specific, threatened,
site-specific activities in which there would not be
notice given in advance or there wouldn't be -- wouldn't
be time, threatened to injure them. It would again be a
challenge to the application --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But your response to that
is going to be, I presume, that in fact, absent a
specific activity before the court, the -- the challenge
is not ripe. So that if you are going to stick to your
position elsewhere in this case, they are going to fail
in that enterprise.
MR. KNEEDLER: And -- and -- and that may --
that may well be right, but that would be a separate
question.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand -- I
don't understand your response. If -- if someone has an
interest in -- in stopping a particular action that
would be governed by -- by -- by this general
regulation, surely that person could -- and is -- is --
is threatened proximately by that action, that person
could certainly bring an action seeking to stop the
action on the ground that this regulation is invalid.
MR. KNEEDLER: That was my -- that was my --
and that was my point.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that would govern that
particular action, but it would also be -- be precedent
for invalidating the regulation in other cases. I --
presumably other courts would -- would similarly say
that the regulation is invalid.
MR. KNEEDLER: Right. And that was the
point I was trying to make. And if I -- if I could
explain -- if I could explain the same point --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask
this one follow-up question, because I want to be sure I
understand your position. Supposing the plaintiff in
his declaration cites three or four cases in which the
action was taken so promptly they didn't have notice in
order to object. And then he says but so -- they -- all
this was too fast for me. Now I want to -- want to do
just what the plaintiffs are trying to do in this case.
Would he have standing then?
MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I -- if there was -- if
there was a category of cases in which that was likely
to happen. Most of the -- most of the -- he may well
have standing in that situation to challenge maybe an
upcoming -- it's an unusual APA suit because -- because
only final agency action can be challenged, but
conceivably a threatened final agency action --
JUSTICE STEVENS: You would agree that with
that scenario he would have standing if his only injury
in this is exactly the same as the plaintiff in this
case?
MR. KNEEDLER: No. The injury would come
from the threatened on-the-ground activity, not the
actual --
JUSTICE SOUTER: He doesn't know that in
advance. That is the premise of Justice Stevens's
question, and it is the premise of mine. There -- the
point is being made by them that this happened so fast
that the threat has been realized before they could
respond to it.
MR. KNEEDLER: If -- if I -- if I could make
a broader point here because there -- there may be
certain categories, certain instances in which that
might happen, but it is -- it is the exception, not the
rule. And -- and the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I will -- I will assume for
sake of argument it is the exception, not the rule.
MR. KNEEDLER: But --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume we have got
the exceptional case. Would there be standing?
MR. KNEEDLER: In -- in the exceptional case
there probably would be standing.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So that if in
Justice Stevens's hypo one could show that there had
been three or four or five instances of action so fast
it was impossible to challenge it, there would with that
as a predicate be standing to challenge the regulation
as these people are trying to challenge it?
MR. KNEEDLER: Not -- no, and that -- and
that was the point I was --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. KNEEDLER: -- not -- not in the way they
are trying to challenge it, because they are trying to
challenge it across the board.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Tell us how they could
challenge it, then? Tell us the right way?
MR. KNEEDLER: What they would have to do is
bring a -- a -- on a -- a particular national forest
where a particular person visited and visited a
particular area and there has been a pattern of
particular activities that occurred without his knowing,
he -- he -- in that situation he might well have
standing to challenge a similar --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if it's the forest
next door that he is worried about and they have not
tried a -- a -- a kind of quickie lumbering action in
the forest next door before, he would not be able to
challenge it.
MR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. The -- the
-- standing has to focus on the particular site-specific
place where the individual has visited and if there is a
repeated pattern of a similar type of activity that he
doesn't know about and maybe --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, why -- why
-- why is that so? I am reading this ARA statute, and
it seems to give people a right to notice, an
opportunity to comment, and to undertake an
administrative appeal.
Why isn't this statute that says, interested
public, you have those rights, you have essentially a
right to a seat at the table, why isn't this statute
like FOIA, like the statute that the Court considered in
the Atkins case, in the FEC case involving information
about APAC?
These were people who said: We are
concerned about saving our forests. That's why Congress
said that before these actions occur, there should be
notice to the interested public, comment, and we are
being cut out from that seat at the table. It doesn't
do us any good after the project has been authorized.
We want to be there when the decision is made to take
action.
MR. KNEEDLER: If I could respond in several
ways. First of all, the due process clause imposes
limitations on agency action, but that doesn't mean that
-- that somebody can go into court and challenge agency
procedures as violative of the due process clause until
there is a specific proceeding going on and -- and
completed in which there has been a violation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this statute says
says before there is a specific action you have a right
to notice, comment, and administrative procedures.
MR. KNEEDLER: There is no indication at all
in the passage of that statute that Congress meant to
confer a judicially enforceable right to obtain those
without complying with the usual APA provisions for
judicial review.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe he has no --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose the statute says
anybody in the country can sue to stop a violation of
the due -- due process clause. Would that statute be
valid?
MR. KNEEDLER: No. You -- you would have to
-- you would have to show a particular injury and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The Article III
requirements cannot be eliminated by Congress?
MR. KNEEDLER: That is -- that is correct.
And -- and there is no indication at all that in this
statute, which was just intended to modify the Forest
Service's intent to change its internal decision-making
processes -- and Congress wanted to restrict what --
what the Forest Service was going to do -- that it
thereby meant to change the fundamental nature of the
agency's own internal regulations which would not --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is that different
from FOIA? I mean there anybody can request anything.
You don't have to show anything beyond -- well, you only
have to show curiosity. You say: The statute gives me
a right to ask for this information.
MR. KNEEDLER: Well -- and the -- the Forest
Service has -- has procedures for notifying people of --
of proposed projects that were in fact invoked in this
case, and we point this out in our brief. There are
really two separate types of procedures.
One is the so-called Schedule Of Proposed
Actions, which includes all the actions in which there
would be a decision memo issued by the Forest Service,
which includes at least all of the projects that
respondents are claiming should be -- should be covered.
That is published quarterly. It -- it is available on
the web. It is also available in person. One of
Respondents' declarants here on behalf of the Sierra
Club says that by using that so-called SOPA, that
schedule, he reviews every project in all 11 national
forests in California. There is also, in addition to
the SOPA -- and will submit comments when necessary.
In addition to the SOPA, the Forest Service
has what are called scoping regulations which -- in
which every on-the-ground project is looked at to see
whether it needs -- there needs to be NEPA compliance
through an EA or an EIS, but also what is the nature of
public participation that is required.
In that scoping process the Forest Service,
the -- the local personnel at the Forest Service, will
look to see who is interested in the particular project.
The way this works on the ground is an organization like
the Sierra Club through its declarant in the -- in the
joint appendix will have somebody monitoring this SOPA,
the Schedule of Proposed Events, and will say: I see
that you have a -- a certain project listed. I am
interest in that. Please notify me when you are about
to take action to thin this -- this area or restore this
burned area. Please notify me.
When that happens, the Forest Service then
sends out a letter, a so-called scoping letter, asking
for comments. So this is not a situation in which the
-- the organizations of the declarants in this case have
been excluded. To the contrary, these are all people
who pay very, very close attention to what the Forest
Service is doing.
The one declarant on which the court of
appeals relied for standing on page 71a of the -- of the
petition appendix, he specifically refers -- the only
specific projects he refers to are timber projects, and
the injunction here goes much broader than timber
projects -- but he said that for example, in the
Allegheny National Forest they put out scoping comments
for a series of 20 timber sales. He knew about those
timber sales and he was able to comment on them. And
the -- the declarants on whom the standing was based to
challenge the Burnt Ridge Project, which is no longer in
this case, in that case the Forest Service -- and this
is in the administrative record -- sent out 1,300
letters to people who had expressed an interest in that
project before it was undertaken. Mr. Marderosian, who
also monitors forest projects --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could any one of those
have brought suit?
MR. KNEEDLER: Anyone -- anyone who claimed
to have used that area could have brought suit. Some of
the -- some of those -- some of the people -- people
submit comments.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I mean -- but the
letter alone, I don't know what the criteria were for
the addresses.
MR. KNEEDLER: Those were people who had
expressed an interest in the -- in the project.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, okay. Okay.
MR. KNEEDLER: And Mr. Marderosian submitted
a 23-page comment to the Forest Service with respect to
the Burnt Ridge Project, and that is the other
declarant. These are people whose profession or
avocation -- serious avocation is following the Forest
Service. So this is not an instance in which -- in
which notice is not generally furnished.
I would like to make the same point I was
making about standing in connection with the -- with the
Administrative Procedure Act as well. Section 702 of
the -- of the APA says that a person who is aggrieved by
agency action is -- may seek judicial review thereof.
The -- the agency action that is subject to judicial
review has to be the agency action that causes the
injury. The procedural regulation does not cause the
injury. It is the on-the-ground activity, the
site-specific decision -- the action, the agency action
approving the site-specific action that causes the
injury. That is what the person is entitled to judicial
review on.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you are saying that
this statute is just unenforceable, because the statute
is supposed to operate before the project?
MR. KNEEDLER: It's -- it's -- it's by no
means unenforceable. In the Burnt Ridge Project that
was at issue in this -- in this case, the plaintiffs
challenged the Burnt Ridge Project when it was completed
on a number of grounds, that it was not properly
categorically excluded from NEPA, that it didn't comply
with the forest plan, but also that it had been approved
without complying with the -- with the ARA appeals
procedures.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that was before
the project was undertaken?
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. An injunction, a
preliminary injunction was obtained, and tellingly, and
I think this is also instructive for ripeness purposes,
there was a PI issued but not because of a violation of
the -- of the ARA; the district court concluded there
was a likelihood of success on some of these other
objections, substantive objections to the project, not
procedural objections --
JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, but --
MR. KNEEDLER: -- and enjoined it and then
the Forest Service went through the project and the --
and the plaintiffs dropped their challenge.
JUSTICE BREYER: And I am pursuing this, but
I'm actually having a hard time with this. Suppose --
suppose Congress passes a statute; the statute says
every citizen of the United States has a right to
receive notice of a certain set of Forest Service
actions. Everybody. We want everybody who wants it to
have notice.
Now, if somebody really wants that notice
and they don't get it, can they sue?
MR. KNEEDLER: At some point that would
begin to look like FOIA, yes. But --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Sorry.
MR. KNEEDLER: But --
JUSTICE BREYER: In any case, I'm trying to
make it look like FOIA.
MR. KNEEDLER: But --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's just what I am
trying to do, and you say yes, they probably could, at
least if you are just supposed to get a piece of paper
that says "Notice." Now suppose Congress says, if you
can show you are the kind of person who regularly asks
and needs such notices, and if a regulation is
promulgated interpreting this statute, you can challenge
that reg prior to enforcement. Now does that violate
Article III?
MR. KNEEDLER: I believe it -- I believe it
probably does, unless you can show that there is an
imminent --
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose they did this.
Suppose they said each agency has the legal power to
promulgate regs interpreting FOIA as to when you get the
thing, and when you don't, and moreover people who are
regular FOIA requesters can challenge those regs prior
to enforcement; what about that one?
MR. KNEEDLER: Conceivably. But I -- what
-- what I --
JUSTICE BREYER: I am looking for a
principle that is going to help me.
MR. KNEEDLER: Congress has not done that
here and this is why I wanted to shift to the APA,
because this is subject to review under the general
standards of the APA. Even if we can assume that there
would be Article III standing to challenge a
threatened -- a threatened, another one in a series of
similar projects like off-road vehicle use or something
which might occur before someone would be able to -- to
-- to challenge it, that doesn't apply to timber
projects and other things that take much longer to plan.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, I don't even
agree with you that a -- that a citizen-wide notice
provision confers standing, because it's close to the
APA.
MR. KNEEDLER: No, I didn't say --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Close -- close to the FOIA.
In FOIA, an individual citizen demands a certain
document which the law entitles that person to. This is
a concrete deprivation --
MR. KNEEDLER: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of something concrete.
And --
MR. KNEEDLER: I didn't -- I didn't -- I
didn't mean to concede that there would be standing.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought you were
doing it. And I certainly don't --
MR. KNEEDLER: No, because you are right.
And here the agency's procedures allow somebody to
request to be put on the mailing list about a particular
project. And that's the way you make it -- make it
known and in fact that happened here. And also the one
declarant -- it's perhaps instructive, the only other
kind of notice other than this sort of situation where a
person says I want to be notified when a particular
project is going -- is going to take place, the only
other form of notice is publication in a local newspaper
of record that each national forest has which shows that
this is -- that this notice provision is localized with
respect to people who are going to be aware of what's
going on in the forest and who are following it. But
the declarant Mr. Bensman, when -- for another purpose
is noticing or is pointing out this publication
requirement in a local newspaper, says that his
organization doesn't want to subscribe to local
newspapers, that would be too much of a burden for them
to have to follow what is going on in newspapers.
That's the -- that's the only kind of
additional notice the statute ever provides for. The
other kind of notice is the notice you get if you
previously expressed an interest in the project, in
which you basically demanded something along the FOIA
lines that Justice Scalia was referring to.
But again, back to -- back to the -- you
call it ripeness, you call it the proper subject of
judicial review as this Court said in National Wildlife
Federation, based on section 702 of the APA, ordinarily
a regulation may be challenged only when it has been
reduced to manageable proportions by a concrete
application of the regulation to the individual's
particular circumstances. It's the application to the
person's circumstances that gets challenged. In this
context, it would be the application of the regulation
that says there is no right of appeal in connection with
the approval of a site-specific activity. If you think
the project was approved in violation of the ARA because
you weren't given a right -- after you got your notice
you weren't given a right to appeal, then you could
challenge that in court on the ground that it was
approved without following the agency's procedures.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the
other side says that that doesn't make too much sense
because the issue in every case is going to be the same,
a purely legal issue, and so waiting for the application
doesn't make any sense.
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I don't think it is a
purely legal issue. The Respondents concede that not
all projects are subject to this statute, and the
district court --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is where do
you draw the line?
MR. KNEEDLER: And that -- that's why it
can't be purely a legal question. As soon as you -- and
the district court acknowledged that environmentally
insignificant projects are not covered by the act, and
so that requires them an as-applied determination as to
whether a particular type of project or even the
particular project is one that is -- that is covered by
the act. And not only that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that you said
the government's position is that the line is to be
drawn for cases that don't require either an EIS or an
EA. Those -- in those cases you don't have to do this
notice, comment, appeal thing. And I thought the other
side is saying, no, that's the wrong place to draw the
line. It would be the same thing in every case, from
the government's point of view, no environmental impact
statement, no environmental assessment required, no
notice and comment. And they are saying you put the
line in the wrong place.
MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but that doesn't
answer where the line ought to be. And even if the
government is wrong as to a particular project, that
means the line has to be somewhere else. It may be that
certain kinds of timber projects should be subject to
appeal but that doesn't mean that some other road
maintenance project should be subject to appeal.
If I may reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Kneedler.
Mr. Kenna.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATT KENNA,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court.
This facial challenge to the Appeals Reform
Act regulations could have been brought outside the
context of the Burnt Ridge Project, as long as we had
shown that it had been applied to a project and
continued to be applied to the plaintiffs on an ongoing
basis.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What if there -- what if
there was not a regulation on this subject, but the
agency, by its constant practice, applies a certain
procedure in all of these cases, would you have it --
the power in the abstract to challenge the agency's
consistent application of a certain procedure?
You could certainly do it in a particular
case, if the agency did something that was unlawful, you
could certainly challenge it? But let's assume you
don't have a particular case, you just object to the
fact that in all of its cases the agency is doing this
thing that is wrong.
Will you have standing to challenge that?
MR. KENNA: The question of rightness in
standing need to be treated a little differently for
that. As far as the rightness question I think it would
be a much more difficult case than here, but I would
think could you do that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You would have standing?
MR. KENNA: You would have to show, as Your
Honor is indicating --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Your complaint is I don't
like the way the agency behaves?
MR. KENNA: Not on that pure basis. No.
You would have to show that -- or we would have to show
some concrete harm from where it's been applied.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you make a
difference with respect to the regulation? Why does the
mere fact that this agency lawlessness happens to be
reflected in a regulation, why does that suddenly alter
the standing calculation? You either have been harmed
or you haven't been harmed.
MR. KENNA: Justice Scalia, I don't think it
changes the standing calculation. I think it does
change the rightness and final agency action especially
question somewhat, makes it much more clear. But we
don't rely on procedural injury here. Even though I
think there is potentially room for it along the lines
of Freedom of Information Act.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Ninth Circuit
relied on it at least as an alternative ground, correct?
MR. KENNA: Well, I think what the Ninth
Circuit did was similar to what the court did recently
in the Winkelman v. Parma School District case where
most of the discussion was about the procedural harms
that the parents of the autistic school children were
suffering. There was only one brief sentence tying it
to the concrete harm, but it did tie it to the concrete
harm. And I think that's what the Ninth Circuit did
here. And certainly the district court very much went
into tying the procedural harm to the on the ground
harm, and that's what it based its decision on.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, to read
just one sentence to you from the National Wildlife
Federation case, because I think it's the biggest hurdle
you face. It's on page 15 of the government's brief.
It says: "A regulation is not ordinarily consider the
type of agency action ripe for judicial review under the
APA until the scope of the controversy has been reduced
to more manageable proportions and it's factual
components flushed out by some concrete action applying
the regulation to the claimant's situation."
It seems like a high hurdle for you to
surmount.
MR. KENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, I think that
needs to be read in combination with the footnote 2 to
that decision, which says of course if you have a
regulation applying a particular measure across the
board --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the Abbott
Labs exception, isn't it? I don't think anybody
suggests that that is applicable here.
MR. KENNA: No, I don't think that's the --
I think the Abbott labs exception is an exception to
where the plaintiff cannot show that the regulation has
been applied to its situation yet.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's when his
primary conduct is nonetheless going to be affected?
MR. KENNA: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the drug
companies have to do something. Well, they don't -- you
know, they have to do it before they can -- they don't
have to wait until they are sent to jail to say that
their conduct has been affected.
MR. KENNA: Yes. But I think where as here
the regulation has been applied to the plaintiffs on an
ongoing basis, it's conceded that it was applied
thousands of times nationwide.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have not
pointed to a particular fact under any of these
affidavits when it was applied to any of the plaintiffs.
In what the National Wildlife Federation case said,
"Some concrete action applying the regulation to the
claimant's situation. "
MR. KENNA: We have the Burnt Ridge Project
itself. And then once we have shown standing, it
becomes a matter of mootness.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You haven't shown
any standing with respect to the Burnt Ridge Project on
an ongoing basis because that has been settled. It's
outweighed -- it's out the door.
MR. KENNA: Right. I think the court's
initial standing analysis is at the time the complaint
is filed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's in for a
penny, in for a pound. If you show standing with
respect to discreet action D, you can challenge A, B,
and C?
MR. KENNA: No, Your Honor, I would
respectfully say that the focus is on the beginning.
And then as the -- as this Court said last term in Davis
v. FEC, then it becomes a matter of mootness, and
between that case and the Laidlaw case, that is a lower
hurdle. So once we had the standing -- and the
Marderosian declaration is worth looking at, because it
talks about harm from the Burnt Ridge Project itself,
which the government concedes, as well as from
application of the regulations to be denied notice,
comment and appeal throughout the Sequoia National
Forest.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I think you never completed
your answer in commenting on the National Wildlife
Federation statement with reference to footnote 2. What
is it that footnote 2 tells us in light of which we must
read what the Chief Justice quoted?
MR. KENNA: Well, the footnote 2 says, of
course, if you have a particular regulation applied to a
particular -- to a category of circumstances across the
board, of course you may challenge it. And I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that all it says? No, I
think it speaks of categories across the board that
affect -- that immediately, concretely affect the
person complaining of the regulation, which is the case
in these areas where you have a regulation requiring
drug companies to have certain -- on pain of criminal
penalty to print certain things on labels. That
immediately affects them.
I think that is what footnote 2 is about,
not about -- not about any regulation that is across the
board. That wouldn't make any sense.
Where is footnote 2. Let's read it.
(Laughter.)
MR. KENNA: There is many cases where it was
not an effect on primary conduct yet a facial challenge
was permitted. In fact, this Court has never rejected
before a facial challenge to a regulation that is
published in the Code of Federal Regulations where it
has been applied on an ongoing basis.
So, in Sullivan v. Zebley, it was child
disability benefits, it was a benefit referring
regulation, which said we see no reason to force as
applied challenges instead of a facial challenge.
You have Thomas v. Union Carbide, which was
not a regulation telling Union Carbide how it had to
manufacture its pesticides, but rather how it would
affect arbitration -- it's arbitration when it got into
disputes, which is like National Park's case, which was
held unright not because of that fact, but because it
had not yet been applied.
When you look at all of these cases that
rejects facial challenge where either the regulation has
been applied and has not -- and then the court gets to
the question of whether it affects primary conduct.
JUSTICE BREYER: The problem they are asking
you on this -- it was at least a problem for me -- I
think it's tough on rightness is because the government
is saying here: Look, you want to challenge it outside
the context of a particular action that you don't like.
Well, there's never going to be an action, never going
to be such an action that we are going to take that you
won't find out about, that you will not be able to
challenge in that context if you are really hurt. There
isn't one. You can't name one that's ever been or
imagine one that ever will be, okay?
Now, is that so?
MR. KENNA: No, Justice Breyer, that's not
so. The joint appendix at page 101 discusses an
instance where Mr. Bensman did not get notice at all.
The issue with --
JUSTICE BREYER: You see where they are
going next. And if you -- suppose that the thing you
just told me, too, has problems or suppose it's pretty
hard to find one, then the -- why this has never been
decided and why it's difficult. Because I would start
with Abbott Labs and say there are three considerations.
How easy is it now to solve the legal problem? Here?
Perfectly easy. Nothing's going to change.
Factor two, how likely is it that they will
work with this legal rule and change it around here?
Zero.
But three, what kind of harm is it going to
cause to the plaintiff if you were to deny him relief
now? And they are saying here that's also zero or next
to zero. So what do you do if the factor that cuts one
way is zero and the factor that cuts the other way is
zero, or near zero?
Now, I have to admit I have never seen a
case on that. I don't know if there has been one
before, and I don't know exactly what to do. And if you
can go read the appendix, maybe I can escape the zero.
MR. KENNA: Well, I think even apart from
the appendix, even apart from the assertion that there
are -- the fact that there are certain actions that will
receive no notice, I think the fact of the matter is we
did what the court has instructed us to do, and that is
we brought a facial challenge in a concrete example with
the Burnt Ridge timber sale project. Now, it's passed.
Now it becomes a question of mootness, and I think the
mootness question is easier to solve because the Court
has said that it's a lesser hurdle than standing, and we
have shown through the Bensman declaration that it's
continuing to be applied to the plaintiffs on an ongoing
basis, that they suffer harm by not being able to get
these procedures which caused them on-the-ground harm
because the forest is not protected as well as it would
be with it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I now have
footnote 2, and it refers, as you say, to a particular
measure that applies across the board to all individual
classifications. It goes on to say, which is final,
"and has become ripe for review in the manner we
discussed in the text." Then we say, or Justice Scalia
says, "it can of course be challenged under the APA by a
person adversely affected. And although that may have
the effect when they get a general decision invalidating
a program, it says that a quite different from
permitting a generic challenge to all aspects of the
program as though that itself constituted a final agency
action."
So you still have to become ripe for review
in the manner discussed, which was the sentence that I
read to you earlier, and the challenge can only be
brought by a person adversely affected. I don't see how
footnote 2 undermines the sentence I have read to you at
all.
MR. KENNA: Well, in that footnote, it's
saying it's quite different from permitting a generic
challenge to all aspects of the land-withdrawal review
program. And I think that was the problem in Ohio
Forestry, where you had this broad program left with
facts to sort through and apply, but the opinion in Ohio
Forestry said, of course, though, if the plan had cut
out someone's right to object to trees being cut, that
would be the kind of action that would be challengeable.
And so I think what that later part is talking about, in
National Wildlife is saying, this isn't the kind of
action we allow challenges to. It's not final agency
action. It's not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it says -- it
says, if it's become ripe for review in the manner
discussed in text. In other words, if it has been
applied to a particular individual adversely affected
then, quote, "a person adversely affected may bring a
challenge. " And I don't -- that seems to me to be a
restatement of the sentence I read you earlier.
MR. KENNA: But that gets us to the standing
question. And here the Marderosian declaration showed
he was affected both with regard to the Burnt Ridge
Project and other projects on the Sequoia National
Forest. We have the Bensman declaration that talks
about how he was harmed in his local forest from not
being able to comment on timber sales, and we have the
subsequent declarations.
And I would also point out in the Lujan v.
Defenders case, both in the note 8 and Justice Kennedy's
concurrence, there's a discussion about how, in
Robertson v. Methow Valley, for instance, a standing
declaration didn't even need to be raised because it was
obvious that, in that case, that the plaintiffs were
amongst the injured because they were a local group in
their local forest.
You know, here we have an assertion
uncontroverted by the government that these are being
applied on every forest on an ongoing basis -- it's
stipulated to that. To contend that the Sierra Club is
not injured, especially in light of the declarations
that we've submitted --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be like
in footnote 2, the general program. Yes, they are
saying these types of activities we don't do the notice
and comment and appeal. That's the general program.
But you have to wait until it's applied to a particular
individual who is adversely affected.
MR. KENNA: Well, all I can say, Your Honor,
is I thought we did that by bringing it in the context
of the Burnt Ridge sale and then it's a matter of --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you had had a ruling
on where you draw the line in the Burnt Ridge case, then
that would have been precedent for all these other
cases, but it was settled, right, so you didn't get a
determination?
MR. KENNA: Yes, Your Honor, we never
brought an as-applied challenge to these regulations in
the context of the Burnt Ridge sale.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are seeking a
different line. And, by the way, I don't know what the
line is that you are seeking. But the government says
if you don't need an EA, then you don't have to give
notice, comment, et cetera. What would be your standard
for when you need notice and comment?
MR. KENNA: Well, it's right in the language
of the Appeals Reform Act. There are two parts that are
important. One is, it says, "a proposed decision
implementing a forest plan shall be made subject to
notice and comment." And then section C states that
"any decision approving such an action shall be subject
to appeal." So you have two elements: That there is a
decision approving something and it implements a forest
plan.
Now, that's the way it worked under the
Forest Service before the Appeals Reform Act was passed
and what Congress meant to keep in place substantively
with a different procedure through the ARA. So a
Christmas tree permit, for instance, an original
Christmas tree permit is exempt, not because it's
insignificant. We've never conceded, and that's what
the whole merits were about, that it's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You need a permit to have a
Christmas tree? Where is this?
(Laughter.)
MR. KENNA: I'm sorry, Your Honor. So if
you want to go and cut your own Christmas tree --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I know what you're talking
about.
MR. KENNA: You know, I get one every year.
I just go down to the local Kreger's hardware store; I
pay my $7 to the clerk. There's no exercise of
discretion, and you can you go and cut your own tree.
Now, that is exempt, not because it's environmentally
insignificant, which, you know, it probably is in most
cases, but because there is no decision approving it.
And that's the way it has always worked, and that's
where we think the line needs to be drawn, although, of
course, the merits were not raised by the government
here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You cut down a tree
in the national forest without approval?
(Laughter.)
MR. KENNA: I did get the permit, Your
Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh.
(Laughter.)
MR. KENNA: I think the other kinds of cases
that are useful to look at are, for instance, Blum v.
Yaretsky for standing, and that was the nursing home
case where nursing home residents that had been denied
-- they had been sent to lesser nursing home facilities,
they were on assistance -- challenged the way in which
that was being handled. And the Court said, you know,
the historical basis for these plaintiffs is that they
have been denied their -- they have been in these
situations and it's perfectly likely that they are going
to be in again. Another case would be the Northeastern
Florida Chapter of Contractors v. Jacksonville case,
which I am afraid we did not put in our brief, but that
was where victims of reverse discrimination had been
regular bidders on construction contracts, and they were
held to have standing because it was obvious they were
going to suffer these harms again and there was not even
a discussion of the declarations.  Here, we --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not unusual. I
mean, standing looks not just to harm that has already
been suffered but to harm that is imminent. And if
these people are regular bidders and they say, you know,
I'm likely to bid on this next project, that's fine.
But these people are -- you don't know any specific
project. They are just people interested in forests
throughout the United States.
MR. KENDALL: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's quite different from
saying, "I am about to suffer harm, imminent harm, to
me." I don't see anything -- you know, anything except
in the case that was settled that has that kind of a
connection.
MR. KENNA: Well, Justice Scalia, I would
suggest that the way those two cases I discussed the
plaintiffs were treated is similar to here, where you
have members who -- it's uncontroverted that they are
constantly using the national forests and commenting on
forest appeals. And we have a reference to 20 specific
timber sales. They weren't mentioned by name, but it's
always been this Court's jurisprudence to elevate form
-- I mean, elevate substance over form -- so it's not a
creative pleading exercise that can either get you in or
out of standing; it's a commonsense inquiry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Tell me the two cases again
that you are relying on for this.
MR. KENNA: Blum v. Yaretsky, and that we
cite in our brief; and then Northeastern Florida Chamber
of Contractors v. Jacksonville. That's a 1993 case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And what's that? What's
the cite for it?
MR. KENNA: 508 U.S. 656 1993.
Now, getting back to the ripeness issue in
particular, as we go through the list of cases, it seems
that the facial challenges have always been permitted in
situations similar to this. The key question is, has it
been applied? So National Parks Conservation
Association hasn't been applied. No prediction that it
might be applied, therefore not ripe. Thomas v. Union
Carbide, I think, is particularly instructive because
there the case preceding that was held unripe because
there had not yet been an arbitration under the federal
insecticide law. But by the time the case came to the
Court, there had been an arbitration that had passed,
and on that basis the Court said yes, this is a ripe
controversy because here it's been applied, and there
was no finding of mootness even though that arbitration
was done, and that's the same situation that we have
here.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can I go back to standing
for a minute.
MR. KENNA: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: You may have looked this up
and may have found something here.
Suppose an organization that has a purely
ideological interest, so it can't get into Federal
court, nonetheless can go before an agency; but they are
not going to get into Federal court. Now, suppose that
agency then has a reg that they think is lawful and
makes their life more difficult. I guess that the fact
that they suffer a procedural injury would not get them
into court. They are already somebody who doesn't; they
don't. So I can imagine cases saying that.
Contrast that with the case with a person
who has a very concrete specific injury, a terrible
allergy to chemical X, and they often litigate that
there is too much chemical X, and now they are before an
agency and they frequently complain about chemical X,
but they don't have a particular case, but they will
often be there. Now, the agency promulgates a
procedural regulation that hurts those people who
normally have a concrete injury. All right? There I
wonder if that purely procedural injury cannot serve as
a basis for standing.
Now, do the cases ask -- so I am contrasting
the two kinds of questions, and I wonder what you found
in the cases as to the second kind, as opposed to the
first kind; and you are free to answer this as one word
"nothing; go look it up yourself, which is a fair
comment.
(Laughter.)
MR. KENNA: Well, Justice Breyer, you know,
of course our case is not that typical because we think
we have on the --
JUSTICE BREYER: You think you are like the
second?
MR. KENNA: Right. I think there is room
under the -- so the FEC v. Atkins cases is the
informational injury case. Then there is the Havens
case which stated that groups that sought to fight
redlining in loaning for -- discriminatorily loaning in
neighborhoods had organizational standing, not
representational as we claim here through our members,
but actual representation in and of themselves. And I
think when you combine those cases together, I think
there is some room for that finding that there is that
injury.
But I would -- I would point out here that
the -- we don't claim it, and even though the court of
appeals, again, talks quite a bit about it, it
ultimately tied it back. And even if it didn't do a job
that this Court found to be sufficient, I think the
focus really has to be on the district court, as that is
what originally looked at the declarations and did a
very good job of discussing the on-the-ground injuries
suffered combined with procedural injuries.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you about
Northeastern Florida? I have dug that out. I don't
think it -- it supports what you say. In its complaint
what was going on here is that there was a -- a minority
business preference adopted by the City of Jacksonville,
and some contractors who were not minorities sued saying
that this was in -- in violation of the Constitution.
And what happened -- what the Court said
about standing was in its complaint petitioner alleged
that many of its members regularly bid on and perform
construction works. Now, if it had stopped there it
might fit your case, but then it went on to say, "and
that they would have bid on designated set-aside
contracts but for the restrictions imposed."
As I read the case there were designated
contracts, of which they said we would have bid on them
but we didn't because of this -- what the case involved
was the assertion by the city that you don't have
standing unless you can show you would have been awarded
the contract. And we said, no, no, you don't have to be
awarded it, but if indeed you were -- you would have
been a bidder in that contract but for this law, that's
enough for standing.
So that's not this case.
MR. KENNA: But I think the record supports
the same kind of assertion. So, for instance, if you
look at Tim Bensman's declaration at page 71a of the
petition appendix, it says how on those timber sales he
would have commented and appealed them if he was given
the opportunity, and he would like to go back there if
he could preserve the quality of those areas that he
visited.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And where is
"there"? He would like to go back where?
MR. KENNA: He would like to go back to the
areas in -- where those 20 timber sales are, some of
which he had been to before and would like to return to.
And I -- and the supplemental declarations, when this
came up again and the government pressed, because they
asked for more specifics, those specifics were provided.
And so, for instance, at the joint appendix
at page 90 you have Eric Wiberg using the Weiser River
drainage and talking about he wasn't going to get notice
of that. Only because he happened to be personally
familiar with the area was he able to communicate his
views to the Forest Service, and it actually ended up
changing what the Forest Service did because he just
happened to find out and he happened to know it. So
that's a specific --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This isn't one of
those after-submitted declarations, is it?
MR. KENNA: That -- that latest one I
referred to is. Yes, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, don't we
generally not look at after-submitted declarations in
determining standing?
MR. KENNA: Your Honor, I don't think that
is correct. I think the Court can look at any documents
in the record which show standing at the time of the
suit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you -- if
yesterday you submitted a declaration, we would look at
that?
MR. KENNA: Well, the cases that the
government provided for rejecting declarations were
offers submitted to this Court or certainly an appellate
court and I agree that is more problematic, or it would
have been more problematic if the district court had
excluded the documents and said it's not going to look
at them. We would be looking at an abuse of discretion
standard as was at issue in Lujan v National Wildlife
Federation. But certainly when a, an appellate court
takes up a record from a district court it is entitled
to look at all the evidence submitted and especially
when it's a case like standing -- or an issue like
standing where it's a constitutional question that is
important and you may look at all the circumstances --
there is no reason to reject a later filed declaration.
But again, we don't rely on those alone. We
think it's the totality of everything that supports --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The later filed,
where along the district court proceedings were they
filed?
MR. KENNA: They were submitted -- after the
judgment setting aside the regulations, there was
litigation over the government's stay motion pending
appeal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you lose that
again, you figure, well, I've got some more -- I can get
some more declarations. The reason we don't look at
after-submitted declarations is because there has to be
under the normal rule, an end to litigation at a
particular time. It seems to me this would be an
endless process. You know, every time the district
court identifies a particular flaw, you would say okay,
here's a declaration, and then they say, well, here's
another basis, well, here's another declaration. I'm
not sure that that's what our cases sanction.
MR. KENNA: Well, the -- the district court
didn't find a flaw. It found that we had standing. It
was -- the government reiterated its standing argument
in the context of the stay. This essentially opened the
door by arguing again, "hey, you have no standing," in
addition to "we should get a stay because of the
equities." And so it seems perfectly appropriate in
that circumstance to submit additional declarations. We
didn't just file them out of the blue because we
thought --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You filed them after
judgment, right?
MR. KENNA: We did. But they -- I think
also the issue is there's been the many decisions of the
Court which say, you know, standing after the fact isn't
going to do you any good. And what I think it's
important to keep clear here is that the declarations
were later filed, but they referred to events going on
before the judgment came down.
So, we have declarations at the time of the
complaint, very specific; the government concedes they
are very specific; they talked about both the Burnt
Ridge sale and the regulation. We have the Bensman
declaration at the time of the merits consideration,
which showed the case was not moot, that he was still
being subjected to these regulations and being denied
notice and comment. And then we have additional
declarations after the fact of the government -- I'm
sorry of the district court's decision, which buttressed
all of the above.
And it seems appropriate under that
circumstance in light of the statements by the Court
that I discussed in the Defenders case and elsewhere,
that standing is a practical inquiry, that standing
should be found in such circumstances.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you want to say a word
about the Ninth Circuit making a law for the entire
nation, on a controversial question that normally the
court would just rule for its own area?
MR. KENNA: Well, I think there is a
difference, Your Honor, between setting aside a
regulation under the Administrative Procedure Act and
what would normally be some sort of nationwide
injunction such as where you had, say, challenged a
local timber -- local forest service district for not
analyzing NEPA correctly, and the Court not only set
aside that action but said, and "oh, by the way anywhere
else in the country that's doing it like this, you are
enjoined, too."
I think it's a very different question where
you have a regulation that's being challenged under the
APA. And it's always been the Court's assumption that
setting aside a regulation, which the APA commands a
district court to do, also using its discretion, means
that it is set aside without geographic limitation. And
so I think, you know, the Ninth Circuit may have said a
bit much to saying it was compelled by the text of the
APA but I do believe the district court properly weighed
the Mendoza interests.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. KENNA: Thank you, Your Honors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler, you
have three minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER: Several points, Mr. Chief
Justice.
First, the Burnt Ridge Project illustrates
the way that we think an issue like this should be
resolved and shows why the sentence from National
Wildlife Federation that you quoted, Mr. Chief Justice,
disposes of the case, and that is that a regulation --
particularly a procedural regulation whose only
relevance is in an agency proceeding for approving a
site-specific activity -- that can only be challenged in
connection with that site-specific activity. That's
what the sentence in National Wildlife Federation was
driving at; that is what Section 702 says; when you can
challenge the agency action that aggrieves you and that
is consistent with what the Court said in National
Wildlife Federation, that a -- a court should intervene
only when and to the extent that someone is harmed.
This regulation can only harm someone in connection
with --
JUSTICE STEVENS: That is not what it says.
It says this is our ordinary practice it doesn't say
it's the limit on our practice.
MR. KNEEDLER: He was talking about
injunction. I was talking about --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you were talking
about --
MR. KNEEDLER: -- ripeness under the APA but
it ties in -- it ties into the injunctive relief if I
just could address that for a moment.
Injunctive relief is -- is discretionary and
Section 702 of the APA says nothing in the statute limit
a court's ability to deny relief on appropriate
equitable grounds. And this is best illustrated by the
-- suppose a regulation was challenged by the defendant
in a criminal conviction and the plaintiff says the
regulation is invalid on its face. The APA says set it
aside, but surely the district court dismissing that
indictment would not be setting aside the regulation on
a nationwide basis. The effect of a declaratory
judgment even one rendered in the course of dismissing
an indictment, if you call that a declaration, is -- is
governed by the law of judgments, not by -- not by a
court reaching out and extending its ruling to people
and forests and projects that are not before -- not
before the Court.
And the Burnt Ridge Project shows the way in
which this could be challenged. A particular project
where there was not an appeal, if someone wants to
object to the project on that ground or any other
ground, he -- he can challenge that project, and there
may be other grounds on which that project might be
invalid which is an additional reason not to anticipate
a legal defect but to -- but to wait until it's applied.
The final thing I wanted to say is about the
claim of procedural injury and that this might be like
FOIA or something like this. I think it's instructive
that the -- that the ARA is not written in terms of
conferring rights on individuals. It's a direction to
the Forest Service to prepare a -- to establish an
appeal mechanism, in other words, do what the agency
normally does to establish procedures for administering
things. There is certainly nothing in the text that
suggests that it was intended to confer the
extraordinary sort of right of immediate access to the
court for purely procedural grounds. It was just meant
to fine-tune the agency's own internal administrative
procedures, which Section 706 of the APA makes clear can
only be challenged in a challenge to the final agency
action in which the procedures are applied.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr.
Kneedler. The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the
