CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 11-1274, Gabelli and
Alpert v. the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Liman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS LIMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LIMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This case concerns the statute dealing
exclusively with penalty claims brought by government
agencies to punish conduct made unlawful by statute.
Congress provided a clear and easily administered
statutory time limitation on the government's power to
punish: 5 years, except as otherwise provided by
Congress.
The case does not concern -- the statute
does not concern the government's power to seek remedial
remedies such as disgorgement and injunction.
Consistent with -- Congress's normal approach in penal
situations, Congress fixed a statute of limitations for
penalties. The court below, for the first time over the
century the statute has been in existence, sweepingly
concluded that unless Congress clearly directed
otherwise, the statute and the 5 years did not begin to
run from the time the defendant violated the law, the
ordinary rule for statutes providing for accrual, but
instead --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Liman. Mr. Liman,
you -- you are typing this a penalty case. The
government says yes the accrual is the ordinary rule, but
discovery is the rule when there is fraud, and fraud is
alleged here. So how does the Court decide whether to
type this case a penalty case, as you urge, or a fraud
case, as the government urged -- urges, when both
captions fit?
MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, I think there are
two answers to that. First is that the Court doesn't
need to decide, Congress has decided. Congress made it
quite clear that the rule of accrual applied to all
penalty claims. And as this Court held in
Clark v. Martinez, the same word in a statute cannot be
given different interpretations depending on the
underlying statute to which it is applied.
The second reason, though, Justice Ginsburg,
is that it is not correct to say, and this Court has
never said, that either the Bailey rule or the injury
accrual rule applies to a statutory fraud claim where
the government is seeking to punish. That would --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me.
Justice Ginsburg points out that you're talking about
the statute, but the statute uses the term "accrual."
Is it correct to say that the term "accrual" is not used
in statute of limitations for crimes -- generally -- for
crimes?
MR. LIMAN: For -- for crimes, the general
word that is used is time period from the violation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. And this -- and
this talks about accrual. So that is indicative -- is
indicative of the fact that Congress is using a civil
analogue in the drafting of this statute.
MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, it indicates that
Congress is using accrual as it is understood at common
law. Common law, it means when the claim becomes ripe
and the plaintiff has the ability to sue. What that
means is, as the D.C. Circuit said in 3M -- and we think
the D.C. Circuit got it right on this -- that you look
to the underlying statute pursuant to which the
government is seeking a penalty to see when the claim
became ripe.
In a penalty situation, and under the IAA,
which is what this concerns -- it doesn't concern a
common law fraud claim; it doesn't concern a claim where
there's even any element of deception that's required.
It's a breach of fiduciary duty. What the IAA says is
that the government can sue when the violation occurs.
Now --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Liman, I understand
your argument, but I have a fundamental difficulty,
okay?
Bailey and Exploration Company, with
statutes not too dissimilar from this one, who read the
discovery rule into a fraud claim, both for a civil
litigant and for the government. The only way that I
can tease out a potential difference between Exploration
and this case is somehow that the penalty in this case
is not for injury, but for punishment, as you called it.
Government as enforcer, rather than government as
victim.
Some of us would say that the common wheel
is injured whenever someone breaks a law, so that that
distinction between enforcer and victim makes no sense.
How do you answer that point?
MR. LIMAN: Justice Sotomayor, let me give
you the precise answer to that, which is that in this
case where the government is seeking a penalty, it is
not acting on behalf of underlying investors, and the
recovery is not one that is brought by way of damages or
disgorgement.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's acting as a
sovereign to protect what it thinks is an ordered
society. And if you break that order, you are injuring
the society. That -- that's the best --
MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, I think that is the
articulation that the government would have to make.
don't think it holds up, for several reasons. First of
all, it would represent an extreme departure from
anything this Court has ever held or, to our knowledge,
any court has ever held with respect to the application
of the discovery rule.
Second, when you're talking about penalty,
you're not talking about recovery to -- to victims.
Third, when we're talking about implying a rule, which
is what the government's argument is here -- it's not an
argument to follow the plain language, it's an argument
to depart from the plain language -- you should look at,
and the cases direct you to look at, the policy
concerns. And when you're talking about discover -- a
discovery rule with respect to the government as
enforcer, the rules don't work. They don't work for
several reasons.
First of all, when you've got an injury, a
party who is injured, the statute of limitations has a
natural start date that is not in control of the
plaintiff. There is a relationship to the underlying
violation. And that can be readily measured. None of
that is true when you're talking about the government in
a law enforcement capacity.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Liman, what you
suggested, when we talked about the discovery rule, is
that it has its basis in the notion that a defendant with
unclean hands who has committed deceptive conduct
preventing the plaintiff from understanding that he or
it has a cause of action -- you know, shouldn't be
entitled to the benefit of a statute of limitations.
And if that's the understanding that lies
behind the discovery rule, I guess the question for you
is, why doesn't it apply in this case, as well as, in
a case where the person bringing the action has
himself suffered a harm?
MR. LIMAN: Justice Kagan, I've got two
answers to that question as well. The first is that --
that I don't think is the basis for the -- for the
discovery rule at bottom. The basis for the discovery
rule -- if you look at this Court's opinion in -- in
Rotella, if you look at the Seventh Circuit in Cada, the
D.C. Circuit in Connor -- is the notion that when the
plaintiff cannot discover the injury, doesn't know that
it's been injured, and cannot reasonably know that the
plaintiff's been injured, the plaintiff cannot take the
steps that other plaintiffs would take to investigate
and determine whether they've got a cause of action.
That's not applicable in a government
enforcement context because you're not talking about
there the government as a victim. The government may
not know of the underlying transaction, will not know of
the underlying transaction, unless the government asks.
The second reason is that there is a strain
that -- in the Bailey line of cases -- that really
speaks in terms of equitable tolling and fraudulent
concealment, that sort of a notion of unclean -- unclean
hands. That's not in this case because the government
affirmatively took it out. But we would submit --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How did the government
take it out? I mean, the point here is that there was a
concealment. There was a hiding of what was -- the
impermissible action.
MR. LIMAN: That's -- that's not correct,
Justice Ginsburg. If you'd look at the -- at the
opinion below and you look at the complaint, the essence
of the allegation, which we have not yet had a chance to
disprove before you on a motion to dismiss, is that
there were misrepresentations and omissions made to the
board of the mutual fund. There was no
misrepresentations made to the investing public. That
allegation is not in the complaint. It would not be
accurate. And there is no allegation whatsoever that
anything was hidden from the government or was in any
way concealed from the government. The records here
would have been available -- were available for the
government to look at, at any time.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Liman, finishing up
a point you were just on previously, what's your
position with respect to fraudulent concealment?
Doesn't your theory preclude even the application of
that to tolling of the statute?
MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, I think you could
and should conclude -- that if you reach that issue.
don't think you need to reach that issue.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me about --
MR. LIMAN: Our theory doesn't require you
to come to that conclusion.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is -- it's nice for
you to say that. But tell me, having announced your
theory, how the next step is avoidable? Under what
theory would we say you can't have a discovery rule, but
you can have a fraudulent concealment rule?
MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, in the -- using the
same type of theory and the same methodology that the
Court employed in the RICO context, in the Claire case,
and in the Rotella case, one can read the statute, I
think you have to read the statute, here to say that
"accrue" means accrue. It's the time that the
government can first sue.
That does not necessarily resolve the
question of whether there are equitable exceptions that
the government or any party could affirmatively assert
to toll the statute of limitations, not to delay the
accrual of the statute of limitations.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. -- Mr. Liman, you
acknowledge that a civil action could be brought
beginning from the time when the injured plaintiff
discovers the fraud, right?
MR. LIMAN: That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're really not
arguing for what you might call a total statute of
repose. It seems to me odd that the defendant would be
relieved from prosecution by the government, but not
relieved from a suit for sometimes very substantial
damages by -- by an injured plaintiff who doesn't have
to sue until he's discovered the fraud.
MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, respectfully, we
don't think that's not odd at all. If you look in the
securities context, there is a 5-year statute of repose.
And it would be odd to think that the same Congress that
passed that 5-year statute of repose limiting even the
ability of an injured plaintiff without the tools of the
government to bring a private suit for damages, that's
the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. But that 5 years
doesn't begin to run until the private plaintiff
discovers the fraud, right?
MR. LIMAN: That's -- that's not correct,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No?
MR. LIMAN: Under Title 28 1658(b) the 5
years runs from the time of the violation. It's exactly
coextensive with 2462, and it's not an accident that it's
exactly coextensive.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Liman, how does it
work with a disgorgement remedy? I take it that that's
still -- that you are not challenging the disgorgement?
MR. LIMAN: We are not challenging the
disgorgement in front of this Court, and if this Court
reverses the Second Circuit that -- that issue will
remain in the case and the SEC's claim for disgorgement
will remain, and that's really been the way --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't apply --
you don't say it's too late for them to sue for
disgorgement?
MR. LIMAN: 2462 applies exclusively with
respect to penalties, fines and forfeitures. It does
not apply with respect to equitable remedies.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So is there any statute
of limitations on disgorgement?
MR. LIMAN: There is none. There is none.
JUSTICE BREYER: Does it apply to Social
Security? Does it apply to Veterans Affairs?
MR. LIMAN: The -- there is a Social
Security statute that --
JUSTICE BREYER: Does this statute apply to
Social Security?
MR. LIMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Does it apply to Veterans
Affairs? Yes or no or you don't know?
MR. LIMAN: I don't know on Veterans
Affairs.
JUSTICE BREYER: What about Social Security?
MR. LIMAN: Social Security, there is an
underlying statute --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then, I'm asking about this
statute. Does it apply?
MR. LIMAN: The answer is yes. The answer
is yes. It applies to a broad range of statutes, unless
Congress otherwise provided. In fact, there are very
few penalty statutes to which it does not apply.
JUSTICE BREYER: Defense Department?
MR. LIMAN: It does apply to a number of
Defense Department statutes. I'm hesitating --
JUSTICE BREYER: Antitrust?
MR. LIMAN: I'm not sure on antitrust. But
I believe that it applies to -- it does apply to a
number of unfair trade practices. Antitrust, there may
be a separate statute.
JUSTICE BREYER: FTC, you don't know?
MR. LIMAN: FTC, yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: It does apply to FTC, okay.
So Social Security, FTC. Veterans Affairs we don't
know, antitrust we don't know. Okay.
MR. LIMAN: One of the notable features,
Justice Breyer, is that if you look across the U.S.
Code, the government makes a point of saying: Well,
Congress uses penalty -- acknowledges that Congress has
used penalty when -- the word "penalty" when the
Congress has -- I'm sorry, it has used the word
"discovery" when Congress has wanted the statute to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Liman, I'm a little
confused in your answer to Justice Scalia. You said
that the underlying case has a 5-year statute of repose
for a civil claim. If Bailey applies, however, those
claimants who have -- under your theory, who have been
directly injured. The presumption would apply of
discovery, if they were claiming a fraud.
MR. LIMAN: No -- no, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you just arguing
that under this statutory scheme there is no application
of the discovery?
MR. LIMAN: This -- this Court has held in
the Lampf case that Bailey and Holmberg do not apply to
securities fraud case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because of the
alternative language of 5 years.
MR. LIMAN: Well, in Lampf it was 1-year and
-year.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.
MR. LIMAN: And in the Merck case, the Court
made clear that the 5 years was the statute of -- the
statute of repose.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I thought
those involved.
JUSTICE BREYER: Medicare, Medicaid?
MR. LIMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN: It is true, though, isn't
it, that Justice Scalia pointed to an anomaly that could
easily exist in other contexts because this isn't only a
statute about securities violations. So that you might
have in other contexts in which this statute applies a
world in which a private individual could sue, but the
government -- could sue after the -- the period of
time --
MR. LIMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- the 5 years, but the
government could not.
MR. LIMAN: Yes, Justice Kagan. And we
don't think that's an anomaly. We don't think it's an
anomaly for two reasons. First of all, in the private
context, as again I mentioned, the statute, the start
date for the statute of limitations is not in the
control of the plaintiff. That's a critical point.
It's critical in this Court's jurisprudence from Hubrick
forward. It -- there is a natural start date from when
the injury would be known to a reasonable plaintiff.
Not true with respect to the government, who may not
even know of the transaction. And -- but what it -- so
it's -- I don't think there's an anomaly because there
are different statutes of limitation.
JUSTICE KAGAN: And I take it that your view
would be that a case like Exploration, it's different
than this case because it does have a natural start
date; is that the idea?
MR. LIMAN: Number one, it does. And number
two, the relief being sought in Exploration was the
cancellation of a patent, so it was the government as a
party to a transaction. And what the Court really said
in Exploration, what the Court, in fact, said in
Exploration, is that there is no reason why the same
rule applied the same way couldn't benefit the
government, as well as the private plaintiff.
What the government is seeking here is not
the same rule and would not be applied in the same way
because you are talking about a transaction that is a,
frankly, a private transaction that there is no reason
that the government would know anything about. The
claim ultimately here is a claim about what was said in
a private conversation between the advisor to a mutual
fund and the mutual fund -- fund board.
So Exploration, what's notable is that the
government doesn't cite a single case where the
discovery rule has been applied to a party who is not a
victim or that it's been applied -- where it's been
applied and a penalty hasn't been -- a penalty has been
at issue. I mean, neither of those circumstances. We
are talking about a statute ultimately where the plain
language is clear and the government is invoking a
statutory canon not to try to interpret language of the
statute, not even to fill a gap in a statute, but to
override it. The canon that they say overrides the
plain language doesn't exist.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In a civil -- in a civil
action brought by an injured investor or private party,
can that plaintiff, the injured investor, the private
party, in the ordinary course plead and rely upon an
earlier government determination that there had been a
violation and so that that's presumptive showing of
liability?
MR. LIMAN: Your Honor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, the SEC
makes an investigation, finds a violation; can a private
investor then rely on that as a presumptive showing of
liability?
MR. LIMAN: Yeah. I think the lower courts
are mixed on the extent to which you can rely upon the
actual allegations in a complaint.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, not the allegation.
It's an ultimate finding.
MR. LIMAN: Absolutely.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then under your rule.
The plaintiff would be deprived of that.
MR. LIMAN: No, that's not correct,
Your Honor. Under our rule the plaintiff has exactly
the same rights, regardless of how this case is
determined. The plaintiff's cause of action will turn
upon the underlying --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if the government's
statute of limitations runs out and the private investor
is on his own, then the private investor doesn't have
the advantage that exists in other cases of reliance on
a -- SEC finding as a presumptive showing of liability.
MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, that -- that -- our
argument only applies with respect to penalty. The
government has huge powers with respect to disgorgement
and injunctive relief. So, if the government believes
that there is a wrongdoing, the government still has the
ability to bring a claim and the private investors still
have the ability to rely upon the government's
enforcement action and whatever findings come out of
that. So there is nothing in our argument that
diminished, to any degree, the recovery abilities of a
private plaintiff.
In fact, as we've highlighted, that 5-year
period for the -- in the securities laws puts a premium
on the SEC acting promptly. And I would note that
that's something that is not accidental. If you go back
in the legislative history and look to the SEC's
reaction to the Lampf decision, the SEC urged a 5-year
statute of repose, saying that that struck in the
private context the right balance between repose when
you're dealing with complex commercial transactions and
enforcement and -- and recovery.
There's -- the position that the SEC is
taking now is a novel position that to -- to our
knowledge has not been taken by other regulators and
hasn't been taken by the SEC until -- until quite
recently. This statute's been on the books for quite a
long time, and it's notable that agencies have not urged
that -- that interpretation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there no statutes,
Mr. Liman, that say the claim accrues when the injury is
discovered, that use both -- both terms?
MR. LIMAN: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.
missed the question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there no statutes
that use both terms, "accrues" and "discovery"? A
statute, for example, that says, this claim accrues when
the injury is discovered?
MR. LIMAN: There are statutes that use that
kind of language, and that's precisely our point because
it reflects that Congress recognizes the difference and
could, if Congress wanted, provide that a claim for the
violation of the IAA or for any other statute accrues
when it is discovered.
If there are no further questions, I would
like to reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Wall.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court:
I think Justice Kennedy started us off in
the right place by focusing on the statute and its use
of the term "accrual." And when counsel concedes that
that term had an established meaning at common law and
this statute picks it up, I think he gave away his case
because there were a cluster of concepts. One was the
general rule governing accrual: It accrues when the
plaintiff can -- has a right to sue.
But there was a specific principle for cases
of fraud and concealment. And I don't think there is
any basis in law or logic for Petitioner saying that
this statute meant to pick up one of those concepts and
not the other concept.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think the common
law held that it didn't accrue. I think it was an
exception to the accrual rule, that, even though it
accrued earlier, we are going to allow a later suit
where -- where discovery is made later. I -- is that
the way those cases were framed, that it didn't accrue
until discovery?
MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I don't want to
fight about it too much because from the government's
perspective, it doesn't matter --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are making the
argument, so you ought to fight about it.
MR. WALL: It doesn't matter how it's
labeled. It doesn't matter whether we label it as an
interpretation of the statute or an exception for cases
of fraud or concealment. The result is the same.
But I will say you are right, in some cases
it was described as an exception, but as long ago as
Kirby in 1887 and as recently as Merck --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And never in a criminal
case, right? Do you have a single case in which the
discovery rule was -- was applied in a criminal case
with respect to a penalty or a criminal sanction?
MR. WALL: No, not in --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not a single one.
MR. WALL: Well, no. The criminal context
is fundamentally different. This Court has said that
those statutes are construed liberally in favor of
repose and are presumptively not subject to --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the question
because I certainly agree with Justice Scalia that this
is not an SEC statute, this is not a securities statute;
it is a statute that applies to all government actions,
which is a huge category across the board and it's about
0 years old.
And until 2004 I haven't found a single case
in which the government ever tried to assert the
discovery rule where what they were seeking was a civil
penalty, not to try to make themselves whole where they
are a victim, with one exception, a case called Maillard
in the 19th century where they did make that assertion.
They were struck down by the district court, and the
attorney general in his opinion said, the district
court's absolutely right; of course, the government
cannot effectively abolish the statute of limitations
where what they're trying to do is to gather something
that's so close to a criminal case.
So my question is: Is there any case at all
until the year 2004, approximately, in which the
government has either tried or certainly succeeded in
taking this general statute and applying the discovery
rule where they are not a victim, they are trying to
enforce the law for the civil penalty?
The reason I brought up Social Security,
Veteran's Affairs, Medicare, is it seems to me to have
enormous consequences for the government suddenly to try
to assert a quasi-criminal penalty and abolish the
statute of limitations, I mean, in a vast set of cases.
And that -- you know, I have overstated that last remark
a little bit, but I want you to see where I'm coming
from, which isn't so different from the -- from the
questions that have been put to you.
MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, most or many of
the penalty claims that are being brought under Section
62 and other penalty statutes don't deal with fraud or
concealment, and I grant you that it is a problem --
JUSTICE BREYER: All I'm asking you for is
one case.
MR. WALL: So in -- it's a problem of fairly
recent vintage, to be sure --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, it is not a problem of
fairly recent vintage. I'd say for 200 years there is
no case. The only case, as far as I have been able to
discover, which is why I am asking, is that what created
the problem of recent vintage is that the Seventh
Circuit, I guess, or a couple of other circuits decided
that this discovery rule did apply to an effort by the
government to assert a civil penalty. That's what
created the problem. Before that there was no problem;
it was clear the government couldn't do it.
All right. Now, you will tell me that I'm
wrong by citing some cases that show I'm wrong. And
that's what I'm asking. I want to be told I'm wrong,
sort of.
(Laughter.)
MR. WALL: And I guess what I want to tell
you is there aren't cases out there one way or the
other. There aren't cases endorsing or declining to
adopt the discovery rule in the context of fraud or
concealment with civil penalty actions --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You'd expect that - you'd
expect there to be some cases in a couple of hundred
years.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, I haven't found one.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Fraud is nothing new, for
Pete's sake.
MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, it's not that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This is brand-new assertion
by the government that -- tell -- is there much
difference between the rule you are arguing for and a
rule that there is no statute of limitations?
MR. WALL: Absolutely there is. Since --
look, in 1990 the Commission was given the right to seek
civil penalties, so it could only have brought these
actions for the last 20 years. In those 20-plus years,
we have seen 25 reported cases dealing with 2462 and
civil penalties. In 19 of those cases, the Commission
brought its action within 5 years of the end of the
fraud. It used the discovery rule only to reach back
and get the beginning of the fraud.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that
ignores the point that has been raised, is that this
statute does not just apply in the SEC context. How
many cases have you found across the board in the range
of those areas that Justice Breyer catalogued?
MR. WALL: There are cases from the 1980s
and 1990s dealing with concealment, and in our view the
justification is the same for concealment as fraud.
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, we are asking the
same question, but in 30 seconds I am going to conclude
there is none. What I want is a case before the year
00 in which the government sought a civil penalty and
was not trying to recover money or land that it had
lost, and I want the name of that case in which they
said that the discovery rule applies.
The two that you cited, Amy and the case of
Broderick's Will, did involve the government being
injured by losing land or losing money, something like
that. So I have those and I don't think they count, but
I will look at them again. Is there anything else you
would like to refer me to?
MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I don't think
there is anything on either side of the ledger, I will
be very upfront, other than the Maillard case, which I
think even courts at the time, an exploration company,
the court of appeals recognized --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a matter of there
being nothing on either side of the ledger. What's
extraordinary is that the government has never asserted
this, except in the 19th century, when it was rebuffed
and -- and repudiated its position. It isn't just that
there are no cases against you. It's you've never --
the government has never asserted it before.
MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, there were very
few civil penalty actions in which -- that involved
fraud or concealment, in which the government would have
needed to invoke it, or did invoke it and was rebuffed
by courts. I mean, this is a fairly modern problem, and
the question is do all of the same concepts that
compelled one answer in these other contexts compel the
same answer here or does a rule that blankets the
waterfront --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, this is a very
modern problem, but how about the statute of Elizabeth,
which talked about penalties as being a criminal
sanction, but permitted private individuals, not the
government, to seek the penalties and keep it. So you
cite the statute of James, and I look at the statute of
Elizabeth, and try to find the analogy between which
one.
MR. WALL: Well, if this were a criminal
penalty, the government agrees --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even though private
parties could keep the money back then.
MR. WALL: That's right. But what the
Court's been clear on is that there are civil penalties
and there are criminal penalties and which side of the
line it falls on invokes a different set of background
rules and legal norms. The Congress denominated this as
a civil penalty --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I move you to
another issue? If a party can defeat the government's
claim of discovery by showing that the government wasn't
reasonably diligent, how does a party ever accomplish
that? Aren't you going to raise the law enforcement
privilege, the -- some other privilege to block --
discovery?
MR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor, discovery is
playing itself out in cases like these in district
courts. Privilege has not been a very major issue and
the reason is defendants are by and large pointing to
things in the public domain -- private lawsuits, public
filings with the Commission, public statements -- to say
those put the Commission on constructive words --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, if they fail
there, don't you think that they are going to also fail
because they are not going to be able to look at your
records to figure out exactly what you knew or didn't
know?
MR. WALL: No, not invariably. I mean, the
way this plays itself out in the district court is the
Commission says that it didn't know and a defendant
points to something in the public domain and says either
that put you on constructive notice or --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it depends really
on how many enforcement officers the SEC has, is it
reasonable for them to have been aware of the particular
item in some publication. Maybe if they've got 1,000
people reviewing it, but maybe not if they have 10; and
that's just not the -- I mean, it's not just the SEC;
it's all these other government areas.
It seems to me that it's going to be almost
impossible for somebody to prove that the government
should have known about something. And which part of
the government? I mean, it's a big, big government, and
particular agencies -- well, you say, well, the Defense
Contractor Board should have known, but does that mean
that the U.S. attorney's office or the Defense Counsel's
office should have known?
It seems to me that, at least with respect
to that aspect, you really are eliminating any real --
it's certainly not a lot of repose if the idea is, well,
I've got to establish that this particular government
agency should have known about this.
You certainly can't sit back and say, well,
years has gone by and --
MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, they can't
point to a single case where it has been difficult here,
and it hasn't been difficult --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can't point to
a single case?
MR. WALL: Where it's been difficult in
order to make that determination. And it hasn't proven
difficult --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it's
significant if you can't point to a single case?
MR. WALL: Well, I think there are -- where
you should expect those cases to exist, yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are -- are there cases
discussing whether or not a government agency has been
diligent in pursuing a fraud, a fraud investigation?
You see, in the private context we have some sense of
what the plaintiff has to do to protect the plaintiff's
rights. He has to be diligent. But to transpose that
to a governmental agency -- suppose the agency's over --
overworked or underfunded? I don't -- which way do you
come out when the government says that?
MR. WALL: Justice Kennedy, not just this
statute. There are other statutes, the False Claims Act
and others, that have specific provisions requiring
courts to determine when a government official would
reasonably have been on notice of certain circumstances.
That hasn't proven difficult in those contexts. It's
not difficult here.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well I have the same question
that Justice Kennedy just asked? What if a claim could
have reasonably been discovered by a government agency if
it had more resources, but given the resources that it had
it couldn't have reasonably discovered the claim? Would
the discovery rule apply there?
MR. WALL: I -- I don't think so,
Justice Alito. I mean, I think we could say that there
might be circumstances where the Commission would be on
constructive notice and not a private plaintiff because
of its expertise. It would see something in the public
domain that should be meaningful to it that might not be
meaningful to a private plaintiff --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The False Claims Act
example you give is indeed a private plaintiff kind of a
case.
MR. WALL: That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you can say the
government, having been cheated, should have known it
was cheated. But we are talking here about prosecution,
essentially, prosecution for a civil penalty rather than
a criminal. By the way, doesn't the rule of lenity
apply whether the penalty is criminal or civil? So if I
think the word "accrual" is, at best, ambiguous,
shouldn't the tie go to the defendant?
MR. WALL: No. The court's been very -- I
mean, in all of the civil cases applying the fraud
discovery rule, the court has never looked to the
criminal analogies. The canon here is that ambiguities
get construed for the sovereign, not against it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But my question is broader
than that. Does the rule of lenity not apply to all
penalties?
MR. WALL: I don't think it applies in the
context of a civil penalty. I don't think the -- I
don't think the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you sure of that? My
belief is the contrary.
MR. WALL: I can't say that I focused on it
specifically, but I think if the Petitioner said --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's an important
issue in this case, surely. I mean, if "accrual" is
ambiguous and we have a rule of lenity, we should
interpret it to favor the defendant.
MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I don't --
Petitioner certainly couldn't claim that this civil
penalty should have to be proved beyond a reasonable
doubt, or that they are entitled to a constitutional
right to counsel. I don't know why one legal norm among
them all should change in the civil context and not the
others.
JUSTICE BREYER: The reason would be that
the -- you know, once you start talking about applying
this to Social Security, for example, or to Medicare,
for example, or to DOD, for example, you have somebody
who did commit some fraud and they kept the money. You
know, she had five children not four, or she has five,
not six. And I can understand it being fair when the
government catches her -- you know, 18 years later, they
say, We want our money back. Okay. I say that's fair,
not necessarily merciful, but fair.
But then to go and say, and in addition we
want this civil penalty, even though -- of course, we
couldn't have discovered it. Don't you know there are 4
million people who get Social Security or 40 million or
something, and we can't police every one. And so
suddenly, I see I am opening the door, not just to
getting your money back, but to also you're having what
looked like criminal penalties years later without much
benefit of a statute of limitations.
That is at the back of my mind. And I'd
like to know, having brought it up front, what -- what
your response is.
MR. WALL: Absolutely. There are anomalies
on both sides of the coin and I just want to touch on
both very briefly. Take the example you gave. In that
situation, the defendant's fraud or concealment
would allow it or him to escape paying civil penalties,
but not private damages.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's right.
MR. WALL: This Court has never privileged a
private lawsuit above a government enforcement action in
the securities context --
JUSTICE BREYER: But this is not the
securities context. This is the context of -- that's
why I started down the road I was down.
MR. WALL: But even in that context, imagine
if there's a private right of action, the private
plaintiff will be able to recover damages and the
government will not --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, because you have two
people who are hurt, where two people have been hurt.
For example, I wrote the case in Burk and we had the
statute of limitations and Congress focused on this.
And it wrote a two-tier statute. And it wrote a
two-tier statute in large part because it was concerned
about the problem you mention. You have a victim. So
you're either going to let the defendant keep the money
or the victim gets it back. I understand that, but this
is not that context. This is like a criminal context,
where not only are you getting your money back, but you
also want to assess a kind of criminal penalty. And in
that situation, I see a pretty clear line and I don't
understand why the government is so anxious to change
what has long been the apparent --
MR. WALL: Justice Breyer imagine the opposite,
which is far more dangerous. Imagine a bank makes a bad
loan to a veteran, or a bank tells the FDIC that it's gotten
mortgage insurance to help lower income families buy
homes, and then that fraud or falsity escapes detection
for five years. The Veterans Administration or the FHA
then is barred from bringing a civil penalty action, and
there is no private right of action.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's correct, you have a
fraud and you can't put them in jail either, but you can
get your money back.
MR. WALL: But the reason there's no private
right of action in those contexts is, in part, because
government agencies can seek civil penalties. And I
cannot imagine that the Congress, which allowed agencies
to seek civil penalties, where here they had existing
remedies, would have thought that the only people who
could get away without paying them are the ones who
commit fraud or concealment and that remains hidden for
five years.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the reason --
the reason there's no private action -- right of action
is not because the government could seek civil
penalties, it's because Congress hasn't provided a
private right of action.
MR. WALL: That's right because it thought
that the agencies could seek civil penalties and that
was sufficient.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, your case--
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it didn't -- it
didn't necessarily think, and that's why we have a case,
that they could seek civil penalties 10 years later,
years later, however long, so long as they were busy
doing other things and didn't have a chance to know.
MR. WALL: No question. And in the average
typical case, the time that Congress afforded is enough
and we're not here claiming any different, but that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it is a generous
period. It's -- it's 5 years. And, Mr. Wall, maybe you
can explain the SEC's pursuit of this -- of this case.
The alleged fraud went on from 1999 to 2002. It was
discovered in 2003. The SEC waited from 2003 to 2008 to
commence suit. What -- what is the reason for -- for
the delay from the time of discovery till the time suit
is instituted?
MR. WALL: Justice Ginsburg, there was a lot
of back and forth between the parties, document
exchanges, they wanted to make additional submissions.
The government hoped that there would be a settlement
that would encompass all the defendants. Ultimately,
there was a settlement that only went to the fund and
Petitioners did not settle and then the government put
together and brought its case.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Wall, I'll go even
further than Justice Ginsburg. I mean this case actually
seems to me a good example when Mr. Liman said there's
no natural starting point and Justice Kennedy and
Justice Alito referred to just -- this is a -- this is a
decision about enforcement priorities. The government
had decided not to go after market timers. And it
changed its decision when a State attorney general
decided to do it, and it embarrassed them that they had
made that enforcement priority decision, and then the
government made a different enforcement priority
decision. But that's not the kind of situation that the
discovery rule was intended to operate on, is it?
MR. WALL: Justice Kagan, I don't think
that's fair. We didn't go -- it wasn't market timing
that we discovered. What General Spitzer announced was
there are advisors that are permitting market timing,
but misleading investors about it and they're doing it
in return for investments in other funds that they
manage, what are called sticky asset agreements, and
then we started doing market sweeps for those
agreements.
And I don't think we can ignore the evidence
here because we shouldn't decide the case based on
feverish hypotheticals. There are 25 reported cases
brought by the Commission involving this statute, 19
were brought within 5 years and they were just reaching
back to pick up the beginning of the fraud. And the
other six, including this case, the longest lag time was
six and a half years from the end of the fraud to
bringing the complaint.
And the reason is these are dynamic markets.
There's a lot going on in the public domain that puts
the commission on notice, inquiry or constructive, and
starts the clock running. Not only have we not seen a
, a 15, a 20-year case, we haven't seen a 7-year case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if all that's true,
and this is a point I want you to -- I'm not sure I am
right about this point, but remember your banking case
now, we're sounding like that, I thought -- doesn't the
doctrine of fraudulent concealment still apply? That
is, if the defendant, in fact, takes any affirmative
action to hide what's going on, the statute will be
tolled. Is that right?
MR. WALL: That's right, but that --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. As long as
that's right, then in all your banking cases, there are
bank inspectors all over these banks, I hope -- you
know, about once a month or so --
MR. WALL: But Justice Breyer, that's --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- or once a year. And so
the chance of there -- the chance of this somehow
escaping notice without fraudulent concealment, which
would allow the government to extend the toll strikes me
as small, but am I right?
MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I want to be
clear. In the government's view, the concealment would
apply, though Petitioners or others like them will be
back here making exactly the same arguments. The
government's point is just at equity fraud and
concealment were a pair and the justification was the
same for both.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, perhaps I've missed
something. I -- I came in here thinking that both
parties were willing to concede for purposes of this
case that there was a fraudulent concealment. Is
that -- is that wrong?
MR. WALL: I -- I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, for purposes of
presenting the statute of limitations issue that's
before us.
MR. WALL: I don't think the Petitioners are
disputing it here, but I think Mr. Liman acknowledged
earlier that, if pressed, his arguments could be
leveraged to get rid of the concealment doctrine, too.
JUSTICE SCALIA: He didn't concede that
there was fraudulent concealment. All he conceded is
that there was fraud, but later concealment to cover up
that fraud I don't think has been conceded.
MR. WALL: Oh, no, no, not -- I didn't --
I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. I wasn't trying to mislead.
This is not a concealment case. This is a fraud case.
JUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was the
opposite. In other words, I thought both parties, for
purposes of this argument, are assuming fraudulent
concealment has nothing to do with it. We are not to
consider fraudulent concealment.
MR. WALL: This is a fraud case, not a
concealment case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right when I say that?
MR. WALL: Yes. I was just trying to say
that once you say there is a concealment exception, the
fraud exception follows from equity because they were of
a piece. And once you say there is not a fraud
exception, the same arguments will be leveraged to get
rid of a concealment exception. And the reason that
equity treated them as -- of a piece was the deception
was the same. The fraud was self-concealing or even if
it was non-fraud, the defendant could conceal, but
either way --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that concealment is
sort -- you know, it's sort of a self-starter. You --
you -- it -- it doesn't apply always. It applies when
there is concealment, and the person who is being
subjected to the longer statute of limitations is on
notice that if he fraudulently conceals, he's extending
the statute. So I -- I don't think that the one has to
go with the other. Maybe they're both equitable
doctrines, but that doesn't -- that doesn't mean that we
have to apply them to this statute.
MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, for 300 years,
English and American courts looking at this problem have
said where the defendant's misconduct, be it fraud or be
it concealment of a non-fraud, but where the defendant's
deception prevents a plaintiff from knowing that he, she
or it has a cause of action, equity suspends the running
of a statute of limitations. Those -- that has been --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And for 300 years, that has
been said only with respect to civil actions, not with
respect to the government's attempt to exact a penalty.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's correct.
MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, this is a civil
action. I don't think even Petitioners are disputing
that.
JUSTICE BREYER: I assume that we are on the
same ground, but I don't know that you have -- I mean,
I'm worried about your giving up the fraudulent
concealment. I mean, you wouldn't give up equitable
estoppel, would you?
MR. WALL: If I gave up anything on
fraudulent concealment, I didn't mean to.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. I mean -- I
mean, there's nothing --
(Laughter.)
MR. WALL: I want to be very clear, I give
up nothing.
JUSTICE BREYER: If we were to say -- if
we -- if the Court were to hold, it seemed to me, and
this is again tentative to get your response, but if the
-- if the Court were to hold the discovery doesn't --
rule doesn't apply, there's nothing in that that says
equitable -- equitable tolling doesn't apply, nothing in
that that says equitable estoppel doesn't apply, nothing
in that that says fraudulent concealment doesn't apply.
Now, you've shaken me a little bit on the
fraudulent concealment, but I don't know about the other
two.
MR. WALL: Well, all the same arguments are
going to apply. Petitioners --
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, not the equitable
estoppel.
MR. WALL: Oh, sure.
JUSTICE BREYER: Equitable estoppel, the
person comes in and says, oh, yes, I'll tell you all
about what I did, but by the way, I won't assert a
statute of limitations defense, I promise. And the
Court says, hey, you just asserted one, you can't.
MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, Petitioners in a
future case would be back here saying: The text of the
statute says nothing about equitable estoppel. And even
if you've applied it to everybody else's actions, you
can't apply it to me because I'm somehow different.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you will say nonsense
in that future case, won't you?
(Laughter.)
MR. WALL: That's -- I'll be as right then
as I am now.
(Laughter.)
MR. WALL: I mean, Petitioners' argument has
this sort air of unreality. You've applied it
everywhere else he says, but not to me. Think how odd
that is, Justice Scalia, that where you have a
background canon that says ambiguities get construed
for, and not against, the sovereign. When the sovereign
sues quasi-sovereign to enforce the laws, that is
somehow a subordinate interest and the sovereign alone
cannot take advantage of the Fraud Discovery Rule.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Wall, why is it that you
don't you have any cases? I mean, you said way back
when: This didn't come up, this is a modern problem.
So explain to me why this is a modern problem. This is
obviously an old statute. Are you saying that this
statute has not been used very -- was not used very much
until very, very recently?
MR. WALL: There are -- that's right. There
are very few cases that deal with this statute at all
and, obviously, in this context because the Commission's
only had the ability to bring civil penalties for about
years.
But I think that is not a problem unknown to
the law. Again and again, facing garden variety
limitations provisions written just like this one, this
Court applied the fraud discovery rule. And now they
come in and say, oh, but you've never applied it to this
statute. That's true, but everything about this statute
is identical as a matter of text and history to the
statute of Bailey.
The cause of action equally accrued there,
and this Court's applied it across bankruptcy, land,
patent cases --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But what you're running up
against is a skepticism, that -- you know, the
government, which has not -- asserted this power for 200
years, is now coming in and saying we want it. And
the question is why hasn't the government asserted this
power previously?
MR. WALL: I -- there are just very few
cases on it. I think there are very few civil penalty
actions that are being brought at all, certainly to
which this statute apply, and certainly that deal with
fraud or concealment and reach outside the 5-year
period. And I don't have a great answer for why there
aren't cases. All I can tell you is that -- it isn't
like there are cases rejecting our arguments. We just
see an absence of case law.
But what we do see are -- is cases like
Exploration Company, where the government comes in, is
really suing in a sovereign capacity, to redistribute
land from some private land owners to another by
annulling their patents. And this Court rejects
basically exactly the same arguments Petitioners are
making and says it applies equally to the government
when it brings an action as to private plaintiffs.
Now, an action for civil penalties? No, the
relief here is a little different, but if one looks back
at the briefs the arguments are exactly the same. They
made exactly the same claims that the sky was falling
there, and for 100 years they have not been true. There
is nothing important about this statute as a matter of
text, structure or anything else from the other statutes
to which this Court has again and again applied the
rule. And the justification is the same. It's the
defendant's misconduct which keeps the plaintiff from
knowing of her cause of action.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you made
the point earlier that it would be very odd that it's
only the sovereign that doesn't benefit from the
discovery rule when other people can. But it's when
it's the sovereign that's bringing the action that the
concerns about repose are particularly presented. You
know, the sovereign, with all of its resources, can
decide to go after whomever it discovers, however many
years after -- whether it's the Social Security
recipient that Justice Breyer mentioned or -- or anyone
else.
So I at least don't find it unusual that
it's the sovereign in particular that doesn't get the
benefit of whenever you happen to find about it rule.
MR. WALL: No question in the typical case,
but what equity has always said is in cases of fraud or
concealment the defendant is not entitled to repose
until there is discovery of the fraud. And equity has
never looked at the identity of the plaintiff, the
elements of the cause of action, the plaintiff's status,
role, party to what happened in the case. That is
never --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you agree that
when we're talking about the interests in repose that
the one plaintiff we should be particularly
concerned about is the government?
MR. WALL: I -- I don't think that there's a
basis for separating as between private damages lawsuits
and civil penalties. I think when Congress sets a
statute of limitations, that's a limitation on the
various forms of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What about criminal
penalties? Would your argument be different with regard
to criminal?
MR. WALL: Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Incidentally, what makes
something a civil penalty? You just call it a civil
penalty and -- and you don't have to prove it beyond a
reasonable doubt, and you get the benefit of this
extension that you are arguing for?
MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, two very
important things. Yes, our argument would absolutely be
different in a criminal context. In cases like Marion
and Toussie, this Court has explained how statutes of
limitations function in the criminal context is very
different. They are presumptively not equitably tolled,
whereas civil statutes are presumptively equitably
tolled.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What makes -- what makes a
penalty a civil penalty?
MR. WALL: In Hudson v. United States --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, a penalty is a
penalty as far as I'm concerned if the government's
taking money from me.
MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, the Court walked
through in Hudson v. United States the test for
denominating a civil from a criminal penalty. The main
thing is what Congress denominates it, although you can
look behind that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's nice.
MR. WALL: Here, there is no question that
this is a civil penalty. It was denominated by Congress
that way, it functions that way, it is phrased that way.
I think even Petitioners and all of their amici -- not a
single person on that side of the case has attempted to
argue this penalty is criminal rather than civil under
Hudson.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That isn't my point, that
it is criminal. My point is, it doesn't seem to me to
make a whole lot of difference as far as these issues
are concerned.
MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, the Court has
always said that whether the penalty is civil or
criminal carries with it a different set of legal rules
or norms, and no party has ever successfully come into
court and said, well, it may be civil, but it's a little
criminal-like, so I should borrow from the criminal
context.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the --
what about the Halper case?
MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, I think Hudson
overruled Halper in large part, and no one here has
asked this Court to label this a criminal penalty. They
have asked the Court to call this a civil penalty and
yet say the fraud discovery rule does not apply. That,
there is no precedent for.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Liman, you have 5 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS LIMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE Petitioners
MR. LIMAN: Just a few points in rebuttal.
First of all, with respect to whether this
is a criminal penalty and whether the rules of lenity
apply, this Court has held in the Commissioner v.
Ackerly case that the rule of lenity applies to civil
penalties.
Just as an --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What
case?
MR. LIMAN: I believe it's Commissioner
against Ackerly. It's cited in one of the -- one of the
amicus briefs.
Second, the concession that you just heard a
moment ago, that the statute would not apply as the
government says it should apply if this was deemed to be
a criminal penalty, we submit under this Court's
reasoning in Clark v. Martinez, it just gave away the
store in the government's case because if it is
possible -- as the government has now admitted it's
possible -- and I don't want to get into all of the
permutations of Hudson -- but if it is possible that the
label of civil penalty does not -- is not dispositive as
to whether a penalty is civil or criminal, then, as the
Court held in Clark v. Martinez, the lowest common
denominator applies.
One has to interpret this statute so that it
is applicable across the range of statutes. And if
that's so, then it follows, it runs from accrual as that
word is commonly understood.
Next point. The government said that there
are no cases where the Court considered the -- the claim
that it is making. We would point the Court's attention
to the Rotella case, in which in the context of a
private plaintiff, who did not have the resources of the
government, the argument was made that the RICO statute
should have a discovery of the violation-type principle.
And the argument was made there that RICO
can encompass a pattern of fraudulent acts. And the
plaintiff in that case said, as the government says
here, fraud can be concealed, can be complex, can be
difficult to discover.
And the Court unanimously had a response to
that. The response was that, at least as soon as you
know the injury, where there is an injury element, the
difficulty of discovery of the actual violation doesn't
defer the running of the statute of limitations. It
would defeat the purposes of a statute of limitations.
The government also argued that the problems
of privilege are not significant ones. We would point
the Court's attention to the Joint Appendix in the
Second Circuit, where the government asserted privilege
with respect to our questions about its investigations
of the counterparty to this alleged quid -- quid pro
quo.
The Court also asked a question of whether
there are any cases in which courts have dealt with
government agencies being diligent, and the claim being
the government agency was not diligent. The Court has
dealt with that in a related context, in the
Heckler v. Cheney context. And in the Heckler v. Cheney
context the Court held that type of issue, how an
administrative agency treats facts that are -- that it
discovers and whether it chooses to bring a claim or
not, whether it chooses to believe that they are in
violation of a statute, the agency is charged with
administering is not fit for judicial review. No
different result should apply here.
Just two more points. The False Claims Act
has a -- which has an explicit discovery rule, also has
a statute of repose. It would be very odd, indeed, if
the one circumstance where Congress, one of the few
circumstances where Congress chose to use the word
"discovery," was where the government was injured, and
they -- Congress chose to impose a statute of repose,
where, as they say in the 100 or other statutes that use
language, fraud-like language, Congress intended there
to be discovery and no repose.
And that really ties into the last point,
which is that there are, by our count, if you look at
fraud, misleading, false statement-type statutes, there
are somewhere like 80 or 100-type statutes that use that
kind of language that would be applicable if this Court
affirms the Second Circuit.
This case was in -- the government says this
case was an outlier. There is no reason to believe this
case will remain an outlier.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case in the
