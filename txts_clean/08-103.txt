CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

Mr. Sims.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. SIMS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SIMS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Second Circuit's decision vacating for
lack of jurisdiction a settlement agreement that
compensated authors for all their arguably infringed
works in the face of Congress's direction that Federal
district courts shall have jurisdiction over any civil
action arising under copyright is wrong for three
reasons. First, even -- first, the decision is
incorrect under the unanimous holding three years ago in
Arbaugh that where Congress affords unqualified subject
matter jurisdiction, other statutory provisions argued
to be jurisdictional that do not clearly restrict that
jurisdiction won't be deemed to do so.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a lot harder
case than Arbaugh, though. Arbaugh involved the
definition of an employer and then the scope of the
statute. This one says no suit shall be instituted.
MR. SIMS: Well, Arbaugh relied heavily on
the Zipes case, and the Zipes involved a statutory
threshold condition much like the one here. You
couldn't bring a Title VII action unless you filed a
particular kind of piece of paper with the EEOC. And
Zipes and Arbaugh both held that those statutory
conditions or essential ingredients were not
jurisdictional, and the Court relied, heavily I think,
on the fact that jurisdiction was separately provided
for and the provisions at issue weren't.
The second point I want to make is that,
even putting the clear statement rule of Arbaugh to one
side, statutory text, structure, purpose and history all
point to classifying 411(a) as mandatory but not
jurisdictional.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you are
right that Arbaugh at least set forth a clear statement
rule, but I think that's significant only going forward.
I don't know that Congress, when it passed this
provision, could have been aware of the clear statement
rule that Arbaugh articulated.
MR. SIMS: Well, the Court did apply --
reiterate and apply the Arbaugh rule in the Rockwell
case with respect to a provision that had predated
Arbaugh, and nothing in Arbaugh said that.
But in any event, our second point is that
if you look at the traditional indicia of not only text
but also structure, history and purpose, this provision
should be ranked as mandatory but not jurisdictional.
And the third point I want to get to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree with the --
with the government that it's mandatory for the district
court but prohibited to the court of appeals? The
government has this hybrid where, because of the public
purposes served by registration, not only can but the
district court should raise the failure to register on
its own, but then the government says once you have a
final judgment in district court, it's no longer open
for the court of appeals to raise it on its own.
Do you agree with that or do you say it's
for the defendants to raise, and if they don't raise it,
too bad?
MR. SIMS: Justice Ginsburg, we certainly
agree with the government with respect to the court of
appeals. With respect to the district court, on the one
hand, my clients don't -- are satisfied with the
government's position. On the other hand, as Justice
Scalia's decision, I think, in Day v. McDonough pointed
out, the traditional default rule really is that
defenses are up to defendants to raise.
In this particular kind of situation where
there is no reason at all, I think, to suspect that
defense counsel will not raise 411 whenever -- none of
the cases that Ms. Merritt raises for example, involve
situations of waiver, where the issues weren't raised
until the court of appeals -- I think that the Court can
rely, frankly, on defendants and on the ability of
district judges to nudge defense counsel when they need
nudging.
But if the Court felt that the provision was
important enough so that it wanted to impose on district
courts the obligation of strict policing, I think it
could. But as I say, I have been practicing copyright
law for 25 years; I've never seen a defendant who either
missed a defense or chose not to raise it.
The third point I want to raise if there is
time is simply that, even if 411(a) were deemed
jurisdictional at the outset of the case with respect to
its language which talks about instituting, nothing in
either its text or purpose suggests that Congress meant
to deprive district courts of their usual power to
settle cases with respect to approving settlement
agreements.
In this case, because the plaintiffs
complied with 411(a) at the front door by alleging
properly that they had complied with the obligation, we
think the district court had jurisdiction to send the
parties to mediation and then necessarily to approve the
agreement they returned with three years later. Now
with respect to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can -- can I ask you, one
of the points made by the amicus is that, if I recall it
correctly, that what -- what Congress had in mind in
phrasing it this way was to enable -- enable the party
who had not gone to the Copyright Office to go after
dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, and the implication
is that if it were not held to be jurisdictional, there
would be a merits dismissal because of the failure to
have gone to the Copyright Office first. And therefore
would not -- the plaintiff would not be able to come
back to the court.
MR. SIMS: I don't understand the amicus to
be making that argument. If Your Honor is referring
to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't --
MR. SIMS: -- the third -- the third
sentence of 411(a), I think that's the principal
argument she makes as to why this satisfies Arbaugh and
we think, quite to the contrary, the third sentence of
1(a) --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I didn't -- I didn't
think it related to the third sentence. I -- I thought
she said the whole purpose of Congress was to make sure
that you'd be able to come back, that your failure to go
to the Copyright Office initially would not result in a
merits dismissal so that you could not later go back and
then rebring the suit. If it was jurisdictional, just a
jurisdictional dismissal, the jurisdiction could be
cured by going to the Copyright Office and your suit
could then proceed.
MR. SIMS: Your Honor, I think that the --
because of the way 411(a) is phrased, dismissals under
1(a), whether we are correct that it's not
jurisdictional or whether they are correct that it is, I
think ordinarily --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You would be --
MR. SIMS: -- without prejudice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You'd be able to come back
anyway?
MR. SIMS: Absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought.
MR. SIMS: That's the nature of this
requirement.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought you'd
say.
MR. SIMS: Yeah.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.
MR. SIMS: With respect to the Arbaugh --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- if the statute of
limitations had run, could you still come back?
MR. SIMS: The problem in this case, and
really the reason why the settlement agreement has
turned out the way it did is there is no effective --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, not -- not
necessarily in this case, but in -- but in a typical
case.
MR. SIMS: There is no effective statute of
limitations in these cases, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I said in a typical case.
MR. SIMS: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or is it just --
MR. SIMS: In -- in a case where the
infringement is the existence of something on the web,
then there is no statute of limitations effectively,
because the argument would be that the making available
is an infringement.
We don't think that the last sentence of
1(a) satisfies Arbaugh or indeed is -- is any evidence
toward this being jurisdictional. The last sentence was
inserted, as the history makes perfectly clear, to solve
the problem created by the Vacheron decision that the
Second Circuit had decided in 1958. And in that case,
what justice -- Judge Hand had done, and other courts
have done it, too, is to say it is -- district courts
cannot review the registrar's action in denying
registration, and that has to be done in a separate
mandamus action, at that point in Washington, D.C.
So the lesson simply is Congress's way of
saying very clearly: We want to get rid of that
rigamarole and we want to allow all this to be done
efficiently. But the statement that this could be done
even if the registrant didn't show up is not at all any
statement, much less a clear statement, that this was
intended to be jurisdictional. Now --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Sims, it has been
pointed out that you have taken inconsistent positions.
That is, back in the district court before there was a
settlement, you urged before the district court that
1(a) was a jurisdictional bar and that that precluded
certifying a class that included the non-registered
copyright holders. You did make that argument in the
district court, and now you are saying -- you are
confessing error, that was wrong?
MR. SIMS: Your Honor, I don't think it's
fair to say that we made that argument. We did -- we
did issue, we did say that sentence in one or two
places, and the argument --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The argument --
MR. SIMS: But I think it's -- I think it's
different, because the issue in the district court was
the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the
settlement and there was an attack on the different
valuation for unregistered claims. In that context we
relied on 411(a). The argument would have been exactly
the same had we said, as we should have, that 411(a) is
mandatory but not jurisdictional. We were guilty of
exactly the loose language that this Court was guilty of
in Robinson and Smith, as it pointed out in Eberhart or
Kontrick.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and --
MR. SIMS: But as -- but as the Court
decision in that case said, there was no need to
overrule Robinson or Smith because really what was going
on there was the Court had been saying the rule was
mandatory, and the additional language that was
jurisdictional was loose language.
Our argument never focused on the ranking of
1(a). It was always rooted in the existence of the
rule which did justify, and on the merits of the appeal
back in the Second Circuit we will again argue did
justify, a different valuation of the claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you shouldn't use
loose language, especially when it's the same loose
language, supposedly, that seems to have been used by
all the courts of appeals and all the district courts.
MR. SIMS: Not all the courts --
JUSTICE SCALIA: For years and years.
MR. SIMS: Your Honor, the first court of
appeals which said that 411(a) said -- not held -- was
jurisdictional was in 1990. That's well after the 1976
act, and the original act had been -- I mean, the 1909
act, which it was patterned after, had been nearly
0 years earlier. There was no court of appeals that
ever said that the 1909 act was jurisdictional, and when
this Court had that case in the Washingtonian case in
the 1930s, there was no reference to it being
jurisdictional by either the majority or the dissent.
And I think Washingtonian is particularly interesting
because there the district court had originally held
that it was jurisdictional and then sua sponte recanted
a few days later and issued another position. And that
is in the record of this Court in Washingtonian and it
was pointed out by Professor Ben Kaplan in the report to
the register and to Congress in connection with the 1976
act.
So the issue was raised for people to think
about if anybody had. But Congress did not in 1976 or
at any time earlier say that this was intended to be
jurisdictional or was jurisdictional. So if -- if
passing the Arbaugh argument with respect to text,
structure, history and purpose -- the structure I think
is particularly telling, because in this case the
provision of jurisdiction is in Title 28, the provision
of registration is in the Copyright Act. They've been
separated --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But still it's a statute
and didn't this Court say in Bowles that a statutory
qualification on the right to sue is generally
jurisdictional?
MR. SIMS: I don't think the Court said
that. I think that the Court said that in Bowles with
respect to time limits for appeal. I think Bowles is
quite clearly limited to time limits for appeal, and the
Court's decision rested on -- heavily on stare decisis.
With respect to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought they made a
distinction to distinguish the other cases, the one -- I
forgot -- the one involving Criminal Rule 33, on the
ground, well, that's a court rule, but when Congress
makes the qualification then it's jurisdictional.
MR. SIMS: But this doesn't involve a time
limit. This involves, as Arbaugh and Zipes did,
ingredients of the claim, preconditions to the claim,
threshold steps with respect to the claim, and I think
there is no reason for the Arbaugh approach not to
apply. But in any event the structure is telling here;
the language is telling as well.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you are
talking about the language, what about John R. Sand &
Gravel? That said we held it was jurisdictional when
the statute said: "Suits shall be barred." The
language here is "No suit shall be instituted." That
sounds pretty close.
MR. SIMS: I think not, Chief Justice
Roberts. The language here has been used in copyright
statutes in 1831, as our reply brief points out, and
includes the language for statutes of limitation and for
copyright notice. And all of those have always been
deemed mandatory. None of them has been deemed
jurisdictional.
Again, Section 507 of the Copyright Act, the
statute of limitations provision here, has almost
exactly the same language as in 411. John R. Sand I
think the Court treated as in Bowles --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that was -- that
was a statute of limitations provision, right? It shall
be barred after six years?
MR. SIMS: Well, John R. Sand involved a
special situation of suits against the government and
considerations of sovereign immunity.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the Court said
it was mandatory. I don't remember when they used the
word "jurisdictional."
MR. SIMS: Well, I think John R. Sand held
that provision was jurisdictional, but I think the
decision went off on -- on stare decisis, and the fact
that the Court had, with respect to the Tucker Act and
matters of suits against the government, taken a
different position.
Those, I think, are really the only
carve-outs, the statutory time limits for appeal and
suits against the government, from the general Arbaugh
rule.
So here Congress has used this language
repeatedly. This Court's own forms for copyright
infringement, which were first promulgated in the 1930s,
have patterned our argument and are contrary to the
amicuses'. They have always treated the registration
provision of the model complaint differently from the
jurisdictional provisions. Those are in separate
sections, not next to each other even.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have forms for
copyright infringement actions?
MR. SIMS: You do. The Federal Rule --
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Live and learn.
MR. SIMS: And because they haven't changed
very much in 70 years, you probably haven't spent much
time with them.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It'S Form 19.
MR. SIMS: Yes. It was originally Form 17.
We have gone through the history. But I think there is
really only one change and in every respect it is
identical to what it was in 1938. And, again, as I say,
it separates out the registration provision from the
jurisdictional provision.
If Congress had wanted to make registration
jurisdictional, it would have been extraordinarily easy
to do so. All they would have had to add at the
beginning of 411(a) is "notwithstanding anything in 1338
and 1331."
We have -- we have included in our brief as
an appendix about 60-odd Federal statutes, which carved
out jurisdiction otherwise provided by 1331 or other
provisions, and 411(a) looks nothing like them. They
all look, roughly, like each other.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask a sort of basic
question I never understood about this case. As I
understand it, the end-of-the-line concern of the
fairness of the settlement, and particularly to people
who have copyrights who have never been registered. Am
I right, that that's what --
MR. SIMS: Well, not -- not quite. There
were -- there were ten authors who objected, I mean, as
a group, and they wanted more money for unregistered
authors. There were, needless to say, tens of thousands
of other authors who didn't object, but it is true that
the objectors wanted -- thought that they had gotten a
bad deal.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But those were people who
owned some registered copyrights, but had other works
that were not -- had no registered copyrights. Is that
right?
MR. SIMS: I --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Were there any of those
people who had no -- no copyrights at all?
MR. SIMS: Well, they -- I don't know, Your
Honor, whether the objectors had any registered works.
I know that the named plaintiffs had more unregistered
works than registered works.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But they had some
registered works?
MR. SIMS: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You see, one of the -- one
of the risks involved here is whether people who had no
registered works are being adequately protected by this
Class C settlement.
MR. SIMS: Yes. This is not a situation --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And just to get the
question on the table -- I don't want to take up much of
your time. I don't understand how it makes any
difference whether you say the rule is mandatory or the
rule is jurisdictional, in terms of the fairness of the
settlement, at the end of the line.
MR. SIMS: I don't think that has anything
to do with the fairness of the settlement. I think we
are here because the Second Circuit blew up the
settlement and said we can't settle this case, and the
only way it was settleable was to give the publishers
and the databases complete peace by clearing all off of
this off.
And so --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- that,
certainly, would be open. If you are correct that the
Second Circuit shouldn't have cut this off at the
threshold by saying it's jurisdictional, the question of
the fairness of the settlement is what you were
contending.
MR. SIMS: That is correct, Your Honor.
I would like to reserve the balance of my
time. But the -- the adequacy and fairness of the
settlement is back in the Second Circuit on remand.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Anders.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER ANDERS
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Statutory prerequisites to suit like Section
1(a) often fall into one of two distinct categories.
They are either jurisdictional and therefore unwaivable
or they are not jurisdictional and are fully waivable.
Section 411(a)'s registration requirement falls in the
middle of those two extremes.
It is not jurisdictional, but it should not
be fully waivable. The provision does not speak to the
power of the courts to decide cases and therefore it
does not limit the court's jurisdiction to adjudicate
infringement suits.
But, because of this phrase and mandatory
language, the requirement should be strictly enforced
whenever the defendant asserts it, and because the
requirement serves important public interest that are
independent of the concerns of the parties to any
individual suit --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your position is that
the district court really should have dismissed this
case at the outset?
MS. ANDERS: I think that, in the ordinary
case, the district court should -- when -- when the
defendant waives the requirement, which would be the
rare case, when the defendant doesn't assert it. When
the defendant waives the requirement, the district court
should consider whether accepting that waiver would
undermine the public interest behind 411.
Now, in this particular case, it may not
have been an abuse of discretion for the district court
to consider those interests and decide that here it
would have been acceptable to accept the defendant's
waiver and permit the resolution to go forward because,
in this case, the periodicals that -- that are
involved -- the works at issue were primarily already in
the possession of the Library of Congress, because they
had been registered as -- the periodicals themselves had
been registered.
So the Library's interest is not as strongly
implicated here. In addition, this is a case in which
there was going to be settlement, so the Court wasn't
going to need to adjudicate the copyright claims and
therefore the opportunity for the register's views to be
taken into account was less important.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe this is the same
question. Are you representing the interest of the
Library of Congress?
MS. ANDERS: Yes, we are representing the
interest of the Library of Congress.
So I think in this case it may have been
appropriate for the district court to conclude that --
that it could let someone go forward, notwithstanding
the fact that some unregistered copyrights were
involved.
But after adjudication on the merits, the
defendant has waived the requirement, and, having come
up, Section 411(a), like any other non-jurisdictional
rule, should be subject to the general principle that
issues that are not raised below should not be
considered for the first time on appeal, absent
extraordinary circumstances.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You were candid to say
that this is in a hybrid category, that the government
was taking an intermediate position. Do you know of any
other provision where the district court has an
obligation to raise the question on its own motion that
is yet not jurisdictional?
MS. ANDERS: I believe this Court has
recognized that waiver doctrines in general are
discretionary, and so, particularly in the area of res
judicata, the Court has recognized in the Plaut v.
Spendthrift Farm and Arizona v. California that the
Court has some discretion to enforce res judicata on its
own motion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Very, very limited. I
think Arizona didn't say any time there's -- there's a
preclusion plea, the Court can raise it on its own.
MS. ANDERS: That's correct. I think also
the plain error rule presupposes that there are some
errors that the district court has a responsibility to
correct on its own, even though neither party has
brought the error to its attention. So in other words,
the district court has the obligation to issue a legal
ruling that neither party has asked for, and I think
that kind of regime is appropriate here because the
public interest at issue, the Library's interest and the
interest in the public record of copyright, those don't
depend on the defendant's litigation decisions -- they
shouldn't depend on the defendant's particular strategic
decisions within a particular case.
The Library's interest will always be in
having every work registered and the public interest and
public record will be the same.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your discussion
of that, including in your response to Justice Ginsburg
and in your brief, do you think that that's within the
question presented, rephrased?
MS. ANDERS: I think it is fairly within the
question of whether the rule is jurisdictional or not, I
think, is -- also encompasses the question of how the
rule should be enforced, assuming that it is
non-jurisdictional, of what should happen in this case.
So I do think that the -- the
characterization of this rule as a mandatory or a
waivable rule is -- is within the question presented.
So I think that the regime we're proposing best gives
effect to the mandatory, but non-jurisdictional language
that Congress used in Section 411(a).
And it also protects the public interest
that the requirement serves, which, again, the
compilation of a public record of copyrighted works in
the copyright office, which allows a robust licensing
system under the Copyright Act.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But how -- how would we get
to hold what -- what you say is the law? It seems, to
me, once we decide it's not jurisdictional and once we
agree with you, that it doesn't -- at least in this
case -- didn't have to be raised sua sponte by the
district court.
That's the end of the case, and so why do we
have to engage in the further discussion, well,
ordinarily, the district court must raise it on its
own and -- you know, and, if it doesn't ordinarily --
you know, the appellate court should.
Why do we have to get into that?
MS. ANDERS: I don't think you have to get
into it, Justice Scalia. I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Which means we shouldn't.
(Laughter.)
MS. ANDERS: Well, that may be the case, but
I think we are simply trying to -- trying to explain to
the Court what we think how the rule should be applied
in the district court, in the -- in the ordinary case,
and then, in the rare case, this one, where the
defendant has waived, and permitting the settlement to
go forward, it wouldn't adversely affect the public
interest that are normally in force here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have an
example of the non-ordinary case? I mean, you seem to
say, either -- I guess it's not always after judgment
that it shouldn't be implemented, I guess. But when
wouldn't it be after judgment?
MS. ANDERS: I think that the -- that in
general, the requirement would be considered waived if
it's not raised before judgment. We can't think of a
case in which the extraordinary circumstance would be
fulfilled.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's more -- so
it's more or less jurisdictional after judgment?
MS. ANDERS: No, I'm sorry. What I meant to
say was that I don't think this rule could ever be
enforced, in the first instance, on appeal if it has
been waived below. I think the general civil rule for
non-jurisdictional requirements is that if it's not
raised before judgment, it's lost on appeal --
circumstances --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's normal, but
not invariable.
MS. ANDERS: Well, I think that's the
rule -- that's the rule that this Court has applied to
constitutional rights with the plain error rule, and
also, with respect to structural constitutional rights
that might implicate other public interests, the general
rule is that if the requirement has not been raised
during the -- during the trial stages of the case, then
it can't be enforced for the first time on appeal.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless it is plain error.
MS. ANDERS: Unless it's plain error, and in
this situation, if the plain error standard applied, or
something even more -- even more heightened in the civil
context, we can't think of a case in which registration
requirements --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty plain that the
things haven't been registered. I mean, right? And
it's pretty plain that if they hadn't been registered,
the district court should not have proceeded with the
case. So I don't know why it wouldn't normally be plain
error in -- in the court of appeals.
MS. ANDERS: Well, I think those -- those
circumstances would be true in most cases in which the
-- for some reason, the requirement hadn't been reached
at the trial stage. So I don't think that the
extraordinary circumstance is present here that would
justify overturning the independent interest in judgment
that our legal system has, the finality of judgment, the
rights of the parties in relying on that judgment and
--
the judicial resources expended.
You know, I think in some ways we can think
of this requirement as sort of like a filing fee, that
it's -- it serves interests beyond those of the parties
at the district court, and therefore you wouldn't think
of it as waivable at the instance of the defendant. But
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There really are, in
our recent decisions, it seems to me, two different
lines of authority. There is the Bowles and the John R.
Sand and Gravel, which treats these sorts of things as
jurisdictional, and the Arbaugh line that doesn't. And
it does seem to me that the language here, "No suit
shall be instituted," sounds an awful lot like "suit
shall be barred," or the other language in -- in Bowles.
MS. ANDERS: I think it's similar to a lot
of language that's used in statutes of limitations,
which are traditionally considered non-jurisdictional,
that no statute -- no suit shall be instituted.
I think what's important is that it speaks
in terms of the actions of the parties, because the
parties institute a suit, not the Court. So it doesn't
speak in terms of the power of the Court. And there's
no evidence, I don't think, that Congress intended to
withdraw the broad grant to jurisdiction in 1331 and
38. I think Bowles and John R. Sand are cases in
which the Court's own precedents had previously treated
the rules at issue as jurisdictional, had accorded them
jurisdictional consequences. So those are cases in
which the Court relied on stare decisis, but I don't
think that we have any similar situation here. There's
no --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the
congressional reaction to the Second Circuit's decision?
It provided that the -- there was to be no
jurisdictional bar in criminal matters. Didn't -- it
didn't affect jurisdiction in criminal matters, but it
didn't say anything about civil matters. So isn't that
some kind of reflected acceptance that in some of the
civil -- in civil cases, it would be jurisdictional?
MS. ANDERS: I don't think so. I think, in
enacting that, Congress had recognized that the
incentives for registration should stay in place in the
civil context, but that making an exception wouldn't --
wouldn't make a difference in the criminal context.
I think Congress still spoke of it as a --
as a non-jurisdictional requirement in the legislative
history, so I don't think that there is any indication
that Congress has ratified the Second Circuit's decision
here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Ms. Anders.
Ms. Merritt?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH JONES MERRITT
AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT
OF THE JUDGEMENT BELOW
MS. JONES MERRITT: Mr. Chief Justice and
may it please the Court:
We will start with the statutory language as
the Court has been discussing for the last half-hour.
Section 411(a) appears on page 1 of the
Petitioner's brief. It uses, first, the mandatory word
"shall" in commanding that no action shall be
instituted.
It does not contain a limitations period, as
statutes of limitations do. It simply says, "No action
shall be instituted." No waiver --
JUSTICE SCALIA: "Until." That's a
limitation period.
MS. JONES MERRITT: Until?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Until preregistration or
registration has been made.
MS. JONES MERRITT: That's correct, Justice
Scalia, and that makes --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's our limitation
period.
MS. JONES MERRITT: That makes -- it's a --
it's a requirement that registration be made. It is
quite analogous, although stronger than the statute in
the Hallstrom case. The hybrid argument that the
Solicitor General was referring to is the Court's
decision in the Hallstrom case, which was a provision of
the environmental statutes that is common in several of
those statutes providing: No action may be commenced
until a notice is filed.
Our provision here is stronger. It says:
"No action shall be instituted," instead of "No action
may be commenced." Even if this case is not -- even if
this statute does not impose a jurisdictional limit,
which I will strongly argue that it does, it at the very
least imposes a mandatory command like the statute in
Hallstrom. And there is no reason in this case to
reverse the Second Circuit, even if this is a mandatory
provision.
As you will recall, in Hallstrom, the
parties had gone through four years of complicated
environmental litigation. Went up through the court of
appeals. The court of appeals reversed, saying, you did
not comply with this notice provision. This Court held
that it did not need to decide whether that provision
was jurisdictional in the strictest sense of the term,
because it was at least mandatory. And the Court
reversed despite that time, sent the case back.
In fact, I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, you
asked about whether the mandatory issue would be within
the Court's grant of certiorari. The grant of
certiorari in Hallstrom referred to the jurisdictional
issue and the Court decided that rather than get to the
strict issue of jurisdiction, it would decide on a
mandatory forum.
But there is no reason, if we are -- if the
Court wants to avoid the jurisdictional issue and to
endorse the mandatory hybrid one, the Second Circuit
should still be affirmed in this case. The parties
raised Section 411(a) quite clearly to the district
court. They used this provision as their major defense
of both the substance of the settlement's fairness and
the representation. The representation was the major
issue that the objectors raised in the district court.
And so both parties, the Plaintiffs and the defendants,
argued in their briefs -- and it's simply not a few
sentences; we've provided the parts of the record in the
appendix to our brief -- that the reason that this
settlement should be upheld was because of this
mandatory, they called it then, jurisdictional
provision. That was an essential argument that they
made to the district court and that they then repeated
to the Second Circuit in the merits briefs long before
the circuit said, then: Wait a minute; you are making a
curious argument here that this is a jurisdictional
provision that upholds your settlement, but that we
still have the ability to look at this settlement if
it's jurisdictional.
I would like to return to the language of
Section 411(a). As I have argued, it begins with this
mandatory language, "No action shall be maintained."
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In -- aren't there
statutes that have exhaustion requirements, or like the
EEOC filing requirement, that say, you can't sue until
you have gone to X administrative agency? And those are
not considered jurisdictional.
MS. JONES MERRITT: That's correct. That's
correct, Justice Ginsburg. Many of those statutes refer
specifically to exhaustion. The Prison Litigation
Reform Act, for example, that some of the parties cite,
refers specifically to exhaustion of remedies after the
"no action" sort of language.
Every jurisdictional statute has its own
language and its own story. We could say they are like
Tolstoy's unhappy families; they are all different. And
in this case, the story of the Copyright Act and its
language is very distinctive, both in the public
purposes that it furthers and in the language that it
uses.
Again, on the statutory language, we have
the very mandatory language, "no action shall be
instituted." No modifiers; there's no provision for
waiver. The Solicitor General's assistant mentioned
that this statute is like fee waivers. It's not at all
like a fee waiver, because the statute for fee waivers
explicitly gives the district judge authority to waive
the fee in the case of an in forma pauperis plaintiff.
This statute contains no waiver for the parties. It
contains no discretion for the district judge.
And in the last word of -- the last sentence
of this very short three-sentence provision, Congress
referred explicitly to jurisdiction. And I would like
to look very closely at that word, because any plain
reading of this section will show -- shows that Congress
intended the entire provision to refer to the
jurisdiction of the court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that -- that
last sentence is just relating to the court can -- has
authority to decide this particular issue,
copyrightability, even though the registrant has chosen
not to enter the suit. The sentence simply says, court,
you have authority to decide this question.
MS. JONES MERRITT: That's the most
immediate reference, Justice Ginsburg, but the three
sentences work together. And if we look at the three
sentences, they appear on the first page of the
Petitioner's brief. The first sentence creates two
categories of cases: Those that the Court may decide
and those it may not. Let us say for now we are not
meaning what that power is. We are simply saying two
categories of cases, one the court may decide, the other
one it may not.
The second sentence then adds a small group
of cases to this first category, the one that the court
may decide. As opposing counsel mentioned, Congress did
that in response to a particular case, the Vacheron
case. Vacheron itself was built on a line of cases
holding that the previous section like 411(a) was a
jurisdictional limit.
The reason that courts could not consider a
copy -- an application for -- a petition for
infringement complaint, I'm sorry, from a person who had
not yet gotten registration was because they construed
that predecessor as jurisdictional and therefore, they
had no jurisdiction to hear an infringement claim until
this person instituted a mandamus suit and got the
certificate from the registrant.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought
that cut against you in the sense that the same
paragraph Congress used the word "jurisdiction," but
they didn't use that in the provision that you are
arguing, does deprive the court of jurisdiction.
MS. JONES MERRITT: No, Mr. Chief Justice,
because when Congress revised this statute in 1976, it
had before it 60 years already of courts construing its
language, no action shall be maintained, which was the
previous 1909 language as a jurisdictional limit. There
had not been any resistance to that notion.
Even courts as early as the 1920s in the
Lumiere case, the Second Circuit did not hold there was
"jurisdiction," but it held that this provision was
unwaiverable. What the parties want to do here, of
course, is to waive the provision.
So the language was working quite nicely for
Congress. No action shall be maintained, they switched
it to instituted to make clear that they meant at the
beginning of the action. There had been a few parties
who had argued during the early 20th century that if
they snuck in the door, they could remain inside -- or
I'm sorry, once they got inside, they could file the --
certificate, and the courts rejected that, but Congress
cleared up that particular problem.
So Congress knows that its first sentence is
working quite well. Congress then adds this second
sentence to -- these, of course, are people working with
the Copyright Office, experts in the area of copyright
law. Congress adds the second sentence which adds the
small category of cases to the ones that may come before
the court. And then in the final sentence, Congress
gives a clarification about that final group of cases.
As Justice Ginsburg said, the -- Congress
made clear that when the registrar decides not to appear
in these cases, the Court may still go on and has the
power to decide these cases.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not -- it's not
a very big deal to register your copyright, right?
MS. JONES MERRITT: It is not at all a big
deal, Your Honor. In fact, for freelance writers one
may register an entire year's worth of work on a single
form for $65.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- but -- but
doesn't that mean that it would be odd to make
jurisdiction over an action for infringement hinge on
whether you've, you know, dotted an "I" and crossed a
"T"?
MS. JONES MERRITT: Not at all, Your Honor,
because again, the copyright statute has a different
history than other jurisdictional statutes. Before
09, owners of copyright had to dot every "I" and cross
every "T" within a limited period of time. If they
didn't, they lost their entire ownership in the
copyright.
What Congress wanted to do in 1909 was to
give copyright owners a longer period of time to comply
with some of these formalities. But, it still wanted to
preserve the public interest that registration serves.
We haven't talked yet about the major public
interest that Congress had in mind here. It is
ironically the very problem that gave rise to this
lawsuit, trying to find the owner's of copyrighted
works.
Before using a copyrighted work, any person
needs to find the owner to ask permission. The
electronic databases in this case have argued that they
are somehow special, that because they need to obtain
many permissions, they shouldn't have to do it.
Universities, libraries, archives obtain as
many or more permissions as electronic databases in
every year. For large universities like Harvard
University or the Ohio State University, we have to
obtain permissions for every article that is distributed
in course packs to our students.
If one of those articles is a freelance
work, written by Mr. Muchnick, for example, we have to
track him down and get his permission to use that
article.
So the registration system was Congress's
response to this problem of finding the owners of
copyright. In this --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it true, though,
that -- that most copyright holders, most people who
write articles, freelance articles, even if it's only
$65, it's not -- it's not worth it because they really
don't expect to get -- they don't think anybody is going
to infringe, in the first place, and if they did what
establishes to be, just wouldn't be economically
worthwhile? So I think it's a fact that most copyrights
are not registered, isn't it?
MS. JONES MERRITT: The beauty, Your Honor,
though, of the solution that Congress adopted with the
registration, moving the registration to a
jurisdictional element rather than to an element of the
claim, as it was in the 19th century, is that the
copyright owner may do this any time. Copyright lasts,
of course, for the lifetime of the owner plus another
years after death. Sixty-nine years after my death,
my heirs could register my copyright if they are finding
that somebody is now making a lot of money off of my
works. And they could then bring an infringement suit
against that person.
It's odd to think of a jurisdictional
restriction as being a looser element than a claim
element, but in this particular story of copyright, it
What Congress did was to say, we want people
to own copyrights immediately without complying with
formality. And in 1976, Congress even extended that to
unpublished works, so I already have a copyright of the
notes I have in front of me and in the e-mails I print
last night and so forth.
What Congress said, with this huge sea of
copyrighted works, before somebody can bring an
infringement action in the Federal court, we want them
to confer a public benefit. We want them to register
the copyright so that other people can find the owner
and request permission.
What will happen in this case under the
terms of this settlement is that the defendant who did
not take time to find the owners of these works, even
though the owners of these works were easier to find
than many of the very elusive of works that archives and
historical societies search for, they did not find --
look for the owners because they thought it would be too
difficult.
This settlement now gives the defendants a
perpetual right to use all of those works without ever
identifying the owners, and without the owners ever
being identified on the national copyright register,
which is what Congress wanted.
If I want to create a competing database for
any of the defendants, I have to undertake the arduous
work of tracking down all the owners.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there's some that
can't be found. So if we take your position, there's
some that can't be found, we just can't create our
database.
MS. JONES MERRITT: Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that's the problem
that's underlying the fairness of this thing.
MS. JONES MERRITT: I'm --
JUSTICE BREYER: In terms of if we take your
approach, no matter how hard it is to find owners, you
are just out of luck. That is to say, there will not be
databases collected, because they cannot be complete
because we cannot find the owner. If we take the
position that it is sometimes waiverable, that obstacle
disappears and now it's a question of the fairness of
the situation.
MS. JONES MERRITT: Justice Breyer, that
concern exists for everybody, not just for electronic
databases. In fact, there is -- the copyright --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's right. I just
wonder why Congress would have ever wanted this kind of
provision to serve as that kind of obstacle in any area.
MS. JONES MERRITT: Because Congress wants
to protect the rights of copyright owners. Congress has
more than 200 years' experience balancing these two
interests. And, in fact, as we speak, Congress is
considering orphan works legislation to address that
specific issue. What Congress has -- and that
legislation would apply to all types of works,
electronic databases, national archives, historical
documentaries.
And what Congress is proposing in that
legislation is quite illustrative. Congress says that
if somebody makes a diligent search and cannot find the
owner, then the person may use the work --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the underlying
fairness. There might be -- maybe they will win on
that. I don't know what the merits of that are. But
certainly an absolute bar might sometimes help some
copyright owners, but many times it will hurt them,
because since they can't be found they can't be
compensated. And if we set up a system and put some
money in it, so if they are ever found they will be
compensated, that will help them.
So that's why I ask the question, why would
a Congress, that wants to help copyright owners create
this kind of system? When all the things you are
talking about can be brought into play when we consider
the fairness of the system.
MS. JONES MERRITT: This is a -- the system
that Congress put in play is, Your Honor, one in which
copyright owners have an absolute right to control the
disposition of their works. That is the current system,
even without getting to the jurisdictional issue.
Congress may change that disposition, and that is within
Congress's control. What they have been trying to do is
to balance the interest of the copyright owner with the
interest of the public in using works. And that is the
perennial challenge in copyright law, how to balance
those two interests.
Section 411(a) is actually a vital cog as
part of that balance, because what Section 411(a) does
is it says to the copyright owner don't worry about all
this business of registering or anything else, you have
your copyright, and you will have it for your life plus
years. If it ever becomes important to you to bring
a lawsuit, then you can register at that time, come into
court. It's a deal that Congress has offered to
copyright owners in order to strike this particular
balance between the public interest and the private
interest.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do they -- if they are
just suing, not for money but for an injunction, do they
have to register before bringing an injunction suit?
MS. JONES MERRITT: Yes, Your Honor, they
do. In order to bring any action -- if the injunction
is based on infringement. So we're -- if the plaintiff
brings an action for infringement and the remedy they
seek is an injunction, then the copyright must be
registered first.
There are some cases in the lower courts in
which we have a plaintiff who has a longstanding pattern
of infringements that a particular defendant has been
engaged in against that plaintiff. The Owen Mills case
is an example. A local photography studio was upset
because a photo duplicating shop kept copying their
copyrighted photographs. They entered an action for
infringement, had registered several of the photographs.
The Court issued an injunction that covered future works
as well, but those were all works within the same
judicial controversy. So an injunction could reach
further than a single registered work as long as we are
talking about one single controversy.
In this case we don't have an injunction, we
have damages, and we have thousands of different
controversies. As the Court knows the class action
rules do not change the substantive law or the rules of
-- of jurisdiction. We have here thousands of different
controversies that have been aggregated for convenience
under rule 23(b)(3), but the court must have
jurisdiction over each of those controversies. Or if we
take the alternative route of Hallstrom, the hybrid
approach, and we say that this is a mandatory
requirement. Congress has been quite clear about this
mandatory requirement, and that mandate must be
satisfied with respect to every controversy in this
class action.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- I just hate
to reveal my ignorance on something like this, but I had
the same problem with your opponent. I really don't
understand why it makes any difference whether you call
a requirement mandatory or you call it jurisdictional in
terms of the fairness of settlement, all the
considerations you are discussing. It seems to me as a
practical matter it doesn't seem to make any difference.
MS. JONES MERRITT: It depends on the brand
of mandatory, Your Honor. There are in this case three
different proposals before the Court. I, as appointed
amicus I have argued that Section 411(a) is
jurisdictional which I think the clear history and
language of the statute, which I will still come back
to --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But would you not make all
the arguments directed at the fairness of the
settlements and so forth if it were merely mandatory?
MS. JONES MERRITT: Yes, because then the
two versions of mandatory are -- the flavor of mandatory
that the Solicitor General urges is that the district --
this is very mandatory, as in Hallstrom -- even if a
party doesn't raise the issue, the district court sua
sponte should raise the issue on its own.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- so mingle -- rule.
I think Ms. Anders answered that question. In this
situation it would be appropriate for the judge to
accept the waiver.
MS. JONES MERRITT: That was -- that was
what Ms. Anders argued. I disagree with that, because
the public interest that Congress has put forth here
would not be satisfied. The parties in this case argue
the same public interests that parties argue in every
copyright case. The plaintiffs in a copyright case
always argue that their interest should be protected
even if they haven't complied with Congress's mandates.
The defendants in a copyright case always argue that
allowing them to copy the plaintiffs' works would give
the public greater access to those works. There are no
special public interests here.
In fact, the electronic databases in this
case have been superseded technologically.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we -- if we are
talking about the ordinary case, and someone sued for
infringement apart from this settlement in the context
that we are in, certainly it's not going to raise that
question whether it's mandatory, optional or whatever.
What defendant who is sued for infringement wouldn't
say, judge, I'm relying on 411(a); they haven't
registered their copyright; they can't sue me? I can't
imagine a defendant in an ordinary copyright case who
wouldn't raise it.
MS. JONES MERRITT: Actually there are quite
a number, Your Honor, just as there are defendants who
will waive statutes of limitations. There are times
when a defendant would rather have the resolution on the
merits, because that then would not allow the plaintiff
to come back into court and sue again. Or the
defendant -- the plaintiff in this case might have sued
-- that you are referring to -- might have sued for
infringement, and the defendant wants to make clear that
it has the right to use this work. That would then
establish that principle with this plaintiff with
related works or with other works.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then let's switch to the
plaintiff. If the plaintiff is in it for money, for
real money, for damages, the plaintiff's going to
register because then the stakes are such that $65 is
well worth it, if the plaintiff thinks it can get a
large infringement award.
MS. JONES MERRITT: The problem, Your Honor,
is that there are many naive people who believe that
famous movies and novels have infringed their freshman
college essays. There are cases exactly like that in
the courts. And in fact the case I cite in the brief is
one in which the author sued the university, claiming
that the department of English obviously had released
his freshman essay to Hollywood, because this movie
built upon his fresh man essay.
In those cases, and this is another
distinction, Justice Stevens, between mandatory and
jurisdictional, the defendant doesn't even have to
appear. The district court can sua sponte dismiss the
complaint for lack of jurisdiction. We cite I believe
seven or eight cases in the brief where exactly that
happened, including two different cases --
JUSTICE BREYER: They wouldn't waive it
then. I mean, the problem, I take it, realistically is
this: let's take a group of people who want to make
databases; now they want to use copyrighted material.
There is a subset of people who have written it they
can't find, so they say here's what we will do. We will
take $100 billion, and we will put it in a fund, and
like ASCAP, that fund can administer this money for the
benefit of anyone who turns up.
Now, maybe that's illegal under some law.
Maybe the class isn't right. Maybe they can't get
proper representation. Maybe it's inadequate, et
cetera. But what I don't fail to see -- what I fail to
see, is how -- whether you could do that or not do it
has anything to do with registration, because we are
talking about the people who aren't here, all of whom,
if you ever bring suit when he's found, will register
the copyright. The only reason they haven't registered,
we don't know who they are, that's why. Maybe they have
registered, for all we know.
MS. JONES MERRITT: All of the people who
haven't registered yet, Your Honor, will not be able to
bring suit, because the class action will extinguish
their claims. That's the important --
JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe they can't do that
because it would be an unfair result. But where is it
in this provision of law that's designed to stop that
ever from happening?
MS. JONES MERRITT: This provision, if we go
back to section --
JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe it won't, by the way.
MS. JONES MERRITT: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: It depends on what the
terms of the settlement are. We could have a subclass
that allows a subset of those people to come into court.
No reason you couldn't. So I don't know whether or not
it's true that they won't register when they are found.
MS. JONES MERRITT: Justice Breyer, once
again the Copyright Act itself already makes that choice
that no person may -- and I'm not talking yet even about
the jurisdictional provision -- no person may use
another's copyrighted work without their permission.
JUSTICE BREYER: In 1909 Congress thought
all this through with the databases and so forth?
(Laughter.)
MS. JONES MERRITT: Oh, yes. The database
issue -- sometime -- sometimes -- in 1976, by the way,
Congress did because LEXIS and Westlaw existed before
76. The -- but the databases are a red herring here.
Sometimes, technology is different, and,
sometimes, it's not. The Library of Congress recently
did a project in which they sought 7,000 permissions for
a single project because they were digitizing the
letters of Hannah Arendt.
They sought those permissions. They -- if
they could not get permission, if they couldn't find the
author or if they didn't get an okay from the author,
they had to leave the work off of the web site because
they are following copyright law.
They have a copy of the original work that
was given to them or that they purchased, and they may
display that, but, if they are going to make a copy of
the work, then they have to comply by copyright law.
I mentioned a moment ago that the databases
here have been superseded by technology, and that is
another way in which technology is not -- is not
different in this case. It is now possible for works to
be scanned in photographic form or PDF form and put in
to electronic databases that are fully searchable, and
that does not violate copyright law.
If you compare, for example, law review
articles on --
JUSTICE BREYER: But why doesn't it? Just
out of curiosity. You are making a --
MS. JONES MERRITT: Because it is -- it is
part of the original collection -- I'm sorry. If the --
if the publisher of the collected work consents to that.
I am thinking of this case in The New York Times --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you say if somebody
who owns the copyright.
MS. JONES MERRITT: Yes. But who owns --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. No. No. But what we
want to do is we want to have, in our database, all of
the material written about slavery, and, lo and behold,
there are 4,000 books that we can't trace. Who, now,
owns the copyright 100 years later? And there is no way
to get those into our database. Whether --
MS. JONES MERRITT: That's correct. That is
correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, that's a
sort of loss, and my same point, that maybe that's as it
should be, but it's rather surprising that this law is
the law that will answer that question.
MS. JONES MERRITT: This law relates to the
question, Your Honor, because this law relates to the
access to the Court.
The way it relates to the question is that
what Congress was trying to do was to give people like
you and me information about those copyright owners, so
that we could find the owner of the book on slavery.
And, as a way to maintain that register,
which Congress started in 1790, it said, to the authors
of copyrighted works, if you want to use our courts, the
judicial powers of the United States, you need to confer
this benefit, so that Justice Breyer could find you, if
he wants to include your work in the database. And that
was the story that Congress did.
I would like to say just one more word about
the word "jurisdiction" in the third line of Section
1(a) because we were interrupted there. The parties
have offered no convincing explanation for that word,
other than to show that Congress understood this whole
provision was jurisdictional.
It refers, most immediately, to
registrability, but that was not a new issue in 1976.
Courts have always decided registrability. And, as the
rules of civil procedure make clear to us, a party's
absence never deprives a court of subject matter
jurisdiction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the rulemakers got it
wrong in Form 19, when they did not write 411(a) as
jurisdictional. They say copy the 1331, 1338, that is
jurisdictional, and then they put the certificate
requirement below the line -- below the jurisdictional
line.
So that was -- well, that was wrong, in your
judgment.
MS. JONES MERRITT: As the -- as the
Congress made -- I'm sorry, as the Court made clear, in
issuing those forms, they are advisory only, and they
are not -- they are not intended to give legal advice to
counsel about what the issues in the case are.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I suppose, if you picked
up any copyright complaint, you will see the
jurisdictional allegation will say 1331, 1338, and
nothing about 411.
MS. JONES MERRITT: And that is quite
common, Your Honor, because, in many situations, what
Congress has done is given a general grant of
jurisdiction in 1331 or 1338 and then pulled it back for
a subcategory of cases, which is what 411(a) does.
In those circumstances, not just in
copyright, but in all sorts of areas, the complaint will
plead jurisdiction under the general grant and then may
show that it satisfies the condition later.
This is -- we are not arguing that -- and
the Second Circuit has not argued that 411(a) is a
jurisdictional grant. It is a section that takes back
part of the jurisdictional grant in 1331 and 1338.
Congress has more than 200 years' experience
working with copyright law, as the questions today have
revealed -- I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your
sentence.
MS. JONES MERRITT: And the questions today
have revealed striking the balance between the public
and the private interest is a difficult one.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MS. JONES MERRITT: Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Sims, you have
two minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. SIMS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SIMS: Thank you, Your Honor.
I, first, want to correct the misimpression
given that the databases think they are special. The
databases haven't thought they don't need to get
permission. They thought they had permission under
Section 201(c), and this Court had the case and
decided -- two of you believed we were right, and more
of you believed we were wrong, but the databases took no
position that they had no obligation.
They got the rights by contract from the
publishers, with representations and warranties, and
that's why, when this case was instituted, they went to
mediation. They resolved this in a way. They got money
from the publishers, who were exposed under
representations and warranties.
The authors were represented by the three
major national freelance author groups in the country,
and this was a way, we thought, to address this problem
responsibly and without taking the Court's time.
Now, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts, you said a
couple of times that you wonder whether the language
here, "No action shall be instituted," doesn't sound
jurisdictional, and exactly to the contrary, the Court's
decision of Jones v. Bock, which, I think -- if I am
remembering, you authored, but, in any event, it was
within a year or two, said that was boilerplate language
used all the time for statutes of limitations that are
not jurisdictional. And, indeed, that is correct.
In the footnote of our reply brief, we list
three times in the 19th century when that very language
was used for statutes of limitations. And, if you put
it into LEXIS or Westlaw, you will get a zillion
statutes with respect to -- exhaust nonjurisdictional
statutes.
So I think, quite to the contrary, that --
that is the language Congress uses when it wants
something to be not jurisdictional.
Now, Ms. Merritt began with the word
"shall," in 411(a). I want to be clear. This case was
instituted in compliance with 411(a). The named
plaintiffs registered their works and came into court.
It went to mediation, and the next thing the court knew,
it had a settlement agreement to review, and it did
review under Rule 23.
She relies on the Hallstrom case, but, of
course, the Hallstrom case, which did avoid saying
whether it was mandatory or jurisdictional, involved the
enforcement of a mandatory -- at least mandatory rule,
on the application of a party, and that's what the Court
does, and that's why, to some extent, other than with
respect to settlement agreements, this case doesn't
matter a lot because the defendants will always be
raising this defense.

Ms. Merritt, you were appointed by this
Court as an amicus to defend the judgment below, and you

On behalf of the Court, thank you for doing
so. The case is submitted.
