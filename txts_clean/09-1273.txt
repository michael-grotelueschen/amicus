CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Clara County.
Ms. Blatt.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
There are three reasons why section 340B
entities do not have a cause of ation to enforce the
pharmaceutical pricing agreement between the Secretary
and manufacturers.
The first reason is that this common law
breach of contract suit is indistinguishable from an
implied right of action to enforce the statute, a right
Respondent concedes it does not have.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't understand that.
A private contract is just that. Two parties go into
the contract. They set the terms of their deal. No one
forced the manufacturers to enter into this deal. So
why isn't the issue exactly what the circuit court said:
What was the intent of the parties to the contract? You
want to make it Congress's intent, but this is a private
deal between you. And Congress may have specified some
terms to include, but --
MS. BLATT: Yes. And the -- what is being
challenged here is the contractual term that
incorporates in haec verba the manufacturer's ceiling
price obligations under the Act, and a third-party
beneficiary's suit to enforce the contract asserts the
same right, seeks the same remedy, and causes all the
same disruptions as a right of action to enforce the
statute.
And another way of saying that is, if the
case begins with the premise that Congress foreclosed
0B entities from bringing an implied right of action
through the front door, Congress did not leave the back
door open to essentially the same suit.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you answer the
point that, if Congress wanted to make this a pure
regulatory statute, it wouldn't have even required a
contract? It would have just passed a statute that says
anyone who wants to -- to sell to the -- to the States
or to the 340B entities -- you can't charge more than
this price.
Why do we even need a contract, unless
inherent with it is some discretion in the agency who's
administering it?
MS. BLATT: Right. Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Discretion that is
consistent with normal contract principles.
MS. BLATT: Right. Well, our position is
obviously that the parties had no discretion to confer
Article III power on courts to enforce an Act of
Congress, and this is. But the -- the basic answer is
that there has always been a huge difference between the
settled rule that parties to a statutory contract are
enforceable -- they have a cause of action to enforce
the contract, because Congress spoke with unambiguously
clear language that the parties could sue. That's the
way statutory contracts must work. They must be
enforceable.
But your answer, sort of as a practical
matter, what's the difference, is this is a -- this is a
contract, and we do think that the Federal law of
contracts and contractual remedies flow between the
parties to the contract. It's a bilateral agreement,
it's not a regulation, and the Secretary made specific
enforceable promises. And there's obviously no even
operation of the statutory mandate without the contract.
But the reverse, in terms of the -- the
long-settled rule that parties must be able to sue to
enforce a contract, there's an equally settled rule that
beneficiaries under a statute do not have the right to
enforce it unless there's a cause of action.
Now, the test that I think Respondent
advocates and that the Ninth Circuit applied is a test
this Court has long since discarded, which is: Well,
I'm a beneficiary, and this is a good idea, and this is
sensible. Even if you don't buy our test of you have to
imply the implied right of action, these lawsuits are
neither sensible nor a good idea and not what Congress
intended. And here's why.
And it is basically the second and third
reasons. So no matter how you come at this case and the
lens through which you look at this, I think everyone
should come out to the same place, which is that neither
Congress nor the Secretary nor the manufacturers signed
up to what is in essence -- would be over 14,000
lawsuits against 500 manufacturers challenging the
pricing for over 35,000 medications under Medicaid.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your adversary claims
you gave up your argument that the contract doesn't make
the manufacturers a third-party intended beneficiary.
Have you given up that argument?
MS. BLATT: No. I think that the -- that
the whole thrust of the petition -- and obviously the
primary argument is that this flouts the implied right
of action jurisprudence and it -- it conflicts with
congressional intent in all events. But one of the
harms, and sort of illustrating just how bad the
decision was, is this conferred rights that the parties
never imagined and that the Secretary did not -- did not
intend.
But I -- I think that, in our view, even if
the Secretary had wanted to, it's not the Secretary's
decision nor was it the manufacturers' decision to go
contract by contract and say this multi-billion dollar
health care program that incorporates another, even
bigger multi-billion dollar health care program -- we're
going to turn this over to Federal enforcement, when on
the face of the statute reflects a deliberate decision
by Congress to withhold --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Private enforcement.
MS. BLATT: Private enforcement -- to
withhold a private remedy in favor of 340B entities and,
instead, channel exclusive authority to the Secretary to
enforce it. And those three specifics, in addition to
the disruption, are that Congress gave manufacturers,
but not 340B entities, a private reimbursement remedy
and a private --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- I'm not
sure of the answer, but is it different in this case or
unusual that the agreement is between the Federal
Government and private entities, as opposed to what I
think is the more typical situation in which these cases
come up, where it's, say, an agreement between the
Federal Government and a State?
MS. BLATT: Well, all your Medicaid cases,
obviously, under State plans --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.
MS. BLATT: -- and a lot of your implied
right of action jurisprudence is dealing with Spending
Clause legislation as to State entities. But there are
a number, a number -- the Rehabilitation Act, the
Davis-Bacon Act, and a fair number of health care
programs -- where the government contracts with private
parties as a public welfare mechanism to get to what I
think are conceded are beneficiaries.
Here, there's a number of beneficiaries.
It's not just the 340B entities. It's the patient
population that's being served and, obviously, the
Federal fisc. So --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, would you
explain the function that the contract mechanism serves?
I mean, you could just have this -- you could just have
the statute say: Thou shalt not charge more than the
ceiling price. Period.
What -- what is accomplished by having the
contract reflecting the terms of the statute?
MS. BLATT: Well, I don't think it's any
different than Mobil Oil or Jackson Transit, where
Congress wants to specify the terms of the contract, and
the contract incorporates in haec verba the statutory
terms. And if there's a breach of that, there are
contractual remedies that flow.
But I agree with you that there's not a
whole lot difference between our position and the
Government, because the Government is absolutely correct
that it's in haec verba and identical, and the statutory
obligation that we're talking about that's incorporated
into the contract is that a certain ceiling price must
be charged.
But the -- the other sort of practical
function is only manufacturers who enter into this
contract are subject to these price controls. So if
they -- a pharmaceutical manufacturer doesn't want to
participate in the program, they're not covered.
And in a typical regulation and I think
general sort of Spending Clause analysis, someone who
accepts Federal funding has considered sort of implicit
consent to the funding obligations because they're
taking the money. But here's there's an express
manifestation both by the Secretary who signed the
agreement and the contractors, the pharmaceutical
companies who signed the agreement.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Before the statute was
amended by I think the Patient Protection Act and there
was a breach of the agreement, did the government assess
penalties?
MS. BLATT: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because -- and the reason
I'm asking this is that you indicate that the government
had a contract remedy. It seemed to me it had a
regulatory remedy.
MS. BLATT: It has got a lot of remedies.
It has -- but it --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What was the contract
remedy that it had at the time this case arose, which
was before the -- these mechanisms.
MS. BLATT: Yes. They're -- right. We are
still -- today is no different than yesterday, because
nothing has happened to implement the 2010 health care
reform except that there are now more civil monetary
penalties than there were.
But the government has statutory penalties,
civil monetary penalties, a right of audit. It can
bring suits under the False Claims Act and can terminate
both this agreement and the Medicaid rebate agreement.
But as a -- the government has contractual
remedies, too. I mean, why Congress, I think -- a
sensible inference for why Congress picked contracts is
that this is -- this piggybacks off the Medicaid rebate
program, and that uses contracts. And that instead --
that in turn, rather, used contracts because the States
had negotiated rebate agreements with drug companies way
before 1990. And so Congress continued the contract
feature.
And then, since the pricing components under
this program are the same pricing components under the
Medicaid rebate program, both programs are parallel and
that both use agreement, one is the Medicaid rebate
agreement. In this case, it's the pharmaceutical --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Blatt, you said that
there's not a whole lot of difference between your
position and the Government's. What is the difference
between your position and the Government's?
MS. BLATT: Well, the Government says a
contract is not a contract even though it says it's a
contract. Our position is this a contract.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make much
sense, does it?
MS. BLATT: The -- the Government sees this,
I think, as just a unilateral -- that the manufacturers
walked in and said we're here and happy to be bound.
But the agreement on its face says the Secretary makes
the following agreement; the Secretary promises this.
The most important promise the Secretary
made to manufacturers is that the Secretary said that
she would not terminate the agreement without good
cause, 60 days' notice, and certain conduct that the
manufacturer did would not constitute grounds for
termination.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What did the manufacturer
promise in exchange for a contract? You do need
consideration. What did they promise that they weren't
already obliged to do by law?
MS. BLATT: Well, the billions and billions
in price discounts they were not obliged to do unless
they -- they signed the contract. But the contract goes
through a ton of manufacturer responsibilities. The
manufacturer -- if the Secretary thinks that there is
reimbursement that's owed, the Secretary can order
reimbursement, and the manufacturer has -- it's a --
it's a pretty substantial --
JUSTICE BREYER: So what is Santa Clara
County supposed do? They -- they think they're being
overcharged. And in your opinion, they -- the company
doesn't, but they do. So what are they supposed to do
if they're right? How do they get the money?
MS. BLATT: Well, the way they have been
getting the money, and for better or worse until 2010,
they have been at the mercy of the vastly larger
Medicaid rebate program, which is run on behalf of the
States. And because this program is so small compared
to that program, all the enforcement activity, which is
all the False Claims Act settlements that Respondent
cites in his brief, that's how, as a practical matter,
it's been enforced.
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm interested in
procedurally what are they supposed to do?
MS. BLATT: Oh, pick up the phone and either
call the manufacturer, the prime vendor --
JUSTICE BREYER: The manufacturer says:
Okay, you're wrong. I'm not; I'm undercharging you.
Now what happens.
MS. BLATT: Ultimately, if they can't get
the Secretary to --
JUSTICE BREYER: He's busy.
MS. BLATT: If she's busy and won't return
the calls, Congress said you can't enforce it --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, Why can't they -- can
they, for example, file a claim with the -- with the
Secretary and say we would like the Secretary to order
them to give us the money; they're violating this? They
go to an administrative law judge. Is there an
administrative remedy of some kind that would be
reviewable in the courts for reasonableness?
MS. BLATT: There's just -- right now,
there's just an informal, non-mandatory --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why is it
reasonable, then, to think that the Secretary would have
entered into a contract which is going to benefit them
and there's no remedy?
MS. BLATT: Because the statute itself said:
We're going to go out of our way to give manufacturers
remedies, make this confidential; manufacturers have
rights of audit, but 340B entities don't. The Secretary
-- here's a vast arsenal of things at your disposal, and
it's channeled through that regulatory regime.
JUSTICE BREYER: But normally under the law
from Marbury v. Madison onward, where there's a wrong,
there's a remedy.
MS. BLATT: But --
JUSTICE BREYER: And the remedy could be
administrative, could be judicial, et cetera. But
you're saying there's none?
MS. BLATT: No. I think 30 years have said
that we're not going down that road. I mean, in
Gonzaga, there was a breach of the statutory provision,
and students presumably are harmed when private
information gets disclosed. But every private right of
action case where you've said no, the argument has
been --
JUSTICE BREYER: But in such cases, there
very often is an administrative remedy --
MS. BLATT: That's true.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and the person always --
any individual in the United States can go ask any
agency to do anything, and there is even review in
instances of a refusal to withhold -- a withholding of
action.
MS. BLATT: There's always an APA action
against the Secretary. I just think --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there here? You said
there was.
MS. BLATT: Well, I think it would be hard
to bring an APA action.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a False
Claims Act action?
MS. BLATT: Yes. Yes. And False Claims
Acts are brought. There's a lot of them, and there's a
multitude of settlements that are outlined in the
briefs.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, to the extent that
you're objecting to the disruption of the Secretary,
there is disruption when it's a private party bringing a
False Claims Act.
MS. BLATT: Well, it's not a private party.
It's the private party who's assigned the claim. I
mean, the case is brought in the name of, and it is a
case by the United States. And that's significant
because the United States has complete and total control
over that case. Here, the problem -- it's bad enough --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if the United States
doesn't take over the case, just lets the qui tam
relator --
MS. BLATT: Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- proceed?
MS. BLATT: Yes, that's right. It's still
brought in the name of the United States with heightened
pleading requirements, and they actually have to allege
a knowing false statement.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you emphasize
that the contract has the language in haec verba of the
statute. What if -- what if it doesn't?
The statute imposes certain provisions. The
pricing I guess is the key one. But in a private deal,
when you're arranging for the delivery of, you know,
pharmaceuticals, you could have a lot of provisions.
It's got to be delivered by this much. You've got to
have this much inventory. You've got to -- whatever.
I mean, what if the contract here included
terms beyond those in the statute? Could those be
enforced by the third-party beneficiaries?
MS. BLATT: Yes. And there is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes?
MS. BLATT: If it's not enforced in the
statute -- only if -- and I think it's significant that
plaintiffs always lose under a third-party beneficiary
because the bar is so high. The government always
enters into contracts on behalf of somebody, and the
government rarely intends to confer enforceable rights,
and the parties rarely do it.
But if you had an express provision outside
the statute that said we intend to confer enforceable
rights on third parties, and it's not an enforcement of
the statute at all, then all your jurisprudence for
determining congressional intent aren't being subverted
and aren't being undermined.
I could give you an example. I mean, it
could be anywhere from something just completely outside
the statute. Together, the pharmaceutical companies
could say we hereby agree to make a contribution every
year to the clinic or hospital for a holiday gift. That
would be an odd contract. I don't see the Secretary
entering into third-party beneficiary contracts. A much
more efficient way would just be to contract with the
entity itself.
But I think this is just another way of
saying that a lot of the energy and breath in the court
of appeals would be saved in going through why the
common law doesn't confer it because congressional
intent, by and large, is going to line up with the
Secretary, the party's intent.
But when you're talking in haec verba, and
this could not be more precise because it's the exact --
it's actually not even 340B. The allegation is it's a
violation of the Medicaid Rebate Act pricing reporting
requirements. It's -- congressional intent is all that
matters.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this a contract with the
Secretary or a contract with the United States executed
on behalf of the United States by the Secretary?
MS. BLATT: It is a contract executed by
HRSA, the administrator of -- an agency within, and he
or she, whoever the administrator is at the time, enters
it on behalf of the Secretary. So the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: On behalf of the --
MS. BLATT: So it's in the name of the
Secretary.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's in the name of the
Secretary?
MS. BLATT: It says -- I mean, it's in the
Pet. App. starting at around 169. It says the
Secretary. And you don't have the signature page, but
I've seen them. They're all signed by the administrator
of HRSA, which is the -- the organization within HHS,
not CMS but HHS, that runs the 340B program. But if I
could -- actually, I'll just save the remainder for
rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Anders.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The pharmaceutical pricing agreement should
not be construed to permit 340B entities to bring suit
to enforce drug manufacturers' price reporting
requirements for two reasons: First, the PPA is not an
ordinary contract, and it does not transform the 340B
program from a regulatory scheme into a contractual one.
Like a Medicare provider --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- is it a
contract at all?
MS. ANDERS: It's not an ordinary contract
in that it doesn't give rise to contract rights in
the -- in the regulated entities. This is very similar
to Medicare provider agreements, in which a health care
provider who wants to enter into the Medicare program
and provide services agrees -- signs an agreement in
which he agrees to abide by the statutes and regulations
set forth in the Medicare program and, in return for
that agreement, is given the opportunity to participate
in the Medicaid -- in the Medicare program.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how do we distinguish
between what you call an ordinary contract and this sort
of a contract, if it's any kind of contract?
MS. ANDERS: Well, I think when the statute
directs an agency to enter into an agreement for the
sole purpose of memorializing the parties' opt-in to the
regulatory scheme and directs -- directs what the terms
shall be, so here provides statutorily what the
reporting requirements will be, that's when the
contract is simply a regulatory mechanism.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are you telling
me you're taking -- then your -- then your co-counsel is
right; you're agreeing with her totally. If Congress
wrote the statute, said these are the terms we want to
give you in a contract, you figure out how to implement
and enforce this, and the Secretary says I don't have
the resources to enforce this, I'm going to write a
contract that gives the 340B entities a private cause of
action, the manufacturers can take it or leave it --
you're taking the position that the Secretary is without
authority to do this?
MS. ANDERS: I think it would be a difficult
question. I think it would be a difficult argument to
say that the Secretary was completely without authority.
I think what has happened here is the Secretary has
reasonably interpreted the statute in providing for an
agreement between the Secretary and the manufacturers to
simply mark the opt-in.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that begs the
question that Justice Alito asked you, which is: If we
go your route, which is, is this a regulatory or some
sort of other contract, how do we tell the difference,
and do we need to go that far? Isn't your position -- I
thought half of your -- other half of your position was
that this is not a third-party intended beneficiary.
All the terms of the contract are between
the manufacturer and the Secretary and the obligations
to the Secretary, not the obligations to the third
parties.
MS. ANDERS: That's exactly right. I
think -- to take the first part of your question, I
think the Court can tell when this is a regulatory
contract when the statute itself simply directs the
agency to enter into an agreement that -- that contains
the terms that are set forth in the statute. And when
you look at the statutory scheme as a whole, it is a
regulatory scheme.
The government is not acting as a
contracting party here. It's acting as a regulator. It
has the authority to impose administrative penalties
which would be reviewed under the APA. There's no
transaction that's taking place with the government.
The only rules governing the conduct are statutory. So
that's why we think you can tell that this is not an
ordinary contract. It's a regulatory one.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a different --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You mean -- you mean
there's no negotiated element to it? It's what the
statute -- it's the same as Ms. Blatt said? It's -- the
contract repeats the words, the terms of the statute,
and that's it; is that what you mean?
MS. ANDERS: That's right. This isn't a
negotiated agreement. The Secretary has simply repeated
the terms of the statute in the agreement. That's
exactly right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could do this, I
guess, by regulation, right?
MS. ANDERS: I think that would be one way.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Issue a regulation
saying manufacturers who participate in this program
agree to do, you know, whatever your contract says.
MS. ANDERS: I think that would be one way
to do it, yes. Throughout this area, though, Congress
has often used agreements to mark entry into the
regulatory scheme, including in the Medicare provider
area, where you do have these agreements with health
care providers. But it would be very odd, then, to say
that the -- the entire area is regulated by breach of
contract law rather than by the, you know, hundreds of
pages of regulations and statutory provisions that
govern the providers' rights there.
JUSTICE ALITO: Could you tell us whether
you agree with the Petitioner's argument in part D of
its brief that private suits would seriously disrupt the
comprehensive statutory scheme, in light of the position
that the Government has taken in other litigation
involving actions brought by States, In re
Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price
Litigation in the District of Massachusetts?
MS. ANDERS: We do agree with the
Petitioners that -- that permitting third-party
beneficiary suits here, if you construe this as a
contract, would interfere with the government's ability
to administer the statutory scheme. This is a national
pricing scheme that's put together by the Medicaid
Rebate Act, which has -- which is heavily regulated.
Allowing 14,000 covered entities to bring individual
suits in different courts without HHS consultation,
without the benefit of the government's input, could
lead to substantial dis-uniformity despite the fact that
these are supposed to be national prices.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're walking away from
your position in the District of Massachusetts? The
States do not have, according to you, the right to
enforce the rebate program?
MS. ANDERS: No. That's actually an
important point. I think in the Medicaid context the
States have a cooperative relationship with the Federal
Government. And so they receive some of these funds
directly, and they have -- in fact, in the Medicaid Act,
it is contemplated that they have their own enforcement
responsibilities. So when States bring State law fraud
suits, State law FCA suits, they actually -- they
consult intensively with HHS. And so, in that respect,
those suits represent the government's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: An implied cause of
action? Is that what you're saying those State suits
are?
MS. ANDERS: Those are actually State law
suits that were involved in the Average Wholesale
Price --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is that regulatory
scheme any different than the one involving the PPA?
MS. ANDERS: Well, the Medicaid Act itself
gives States an enforcement responsibility and says that
they are to use their efforts to find fraud and the
prosecute it. And so States actually have a whole body
of State law, State law false claims act --
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that the State of
California says we'd like our counties to be able to
enforce this. Then what happens?
MS. ANDERS: Under the Medicaid Act, there
would be --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose that
California -- if California wants to say we could bring
this suit like Massachusetts did, you agree they could.
And then they say, all right, but we don't have the
time; we want the counties to do it. Couldn't they do
that?
MS. ANDERS: Well, we think it's very
different when you have covered entities --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what's the difference
between --
MS. ANDERS: -- bringing even a fraud suit.
JUSTICE BREYER: What's the difference
between a State doing it itself through its attorney
general and the State saying we'd like the county to do
it through its county attorney?
MS. ANDERS: Well, there's consultation with
the Federal Government at the front end when the State
-- when the State brings a suit. And so the government
has a chance to coordinate, to avoid dis-uniformity.
But when you have covered entities, you know, thousands
of them, potentially bringing suit in different --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. California
comes to you tomorrow and says the attorney general
says: You know, this is a problem. You don't have time
to enforce this. There should be some enforcement, and
we want to enforce it. And, moreover, we'd like each
county affected to enforce it.
Do you have the authority? Is there any
reason you wouldn't say go ahead?
MS. ANDERS: Well, in that sort of
situation, you might be able to have a State law fraud
suit --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to analogize it
to the Massachusetts one. You say they can just go
ahead and do it, and they say, you know, Santa Clara
County is just as big as Rhode Island. And you say the
AG of Rhode Island can bring the suit; am I right? And
so why can't the -- why can't Santa Clara do it?
MS. ANDERS: Well, in the covered entity
context, the concern is that, because you have so many
of them, if you -- if you start permitting covered
entities to bring suit, you know, this is essentially a
pre-emption question, but you then have 50 different
State regimes, State court regimes, put onto -- grafted
onto, the Medicaid rebate requirements.
This is supposed to be a uniform pricing
scheme. And so once the requirements become
dis-uniform, it becomes very difficult for HHS to
administer the scheme in the way that it's supposed to.
I think it's also important to point out
that the recently enacted Affordable Care Act will
provide the exclusive administrative remedy for claims
exactly like Respondent's once HHS puts that into
effect. So Congress, in looking at the scheme, to the
extent it had concerns about enforcement by covered
entities -- the way it reacted was not to create a
private right of action or provide for breach of
contract enforcement but was simply to give the agency
enhanced authority in order to adjudicate the claims
itself.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It identified the
problem that the individual beneficiaries did not have a
remedy? They -- or that courts had indicated that they
didn't and they thought there should be a remedy?
MS. ANDERS: There were -- there were OIG
reports raising concerns with oversight and enforcement
at a general level, and the way Congress reacted to that
was to put in place this administrative remedy which
will allow covered entities to bring these claims and
will allow HHS to have the first opportunity to
determine the meaning of the AMP and best price
requirements, and to take into account --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt said nothing
has been done. It just went into effect on January 1st,
but are there -- are there plans to implement it?
MS. ANDERS: Yes. The agency is moving
ahead with that. The agency has already issued an
advanced notice of proposed rulemaking back in the fall.
And it has solicited comments about how the -- the
administrative scheme should look. That comment period
has closed, and so now the agency is in the process
of -- of moving forward with the regulatory --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I understand your
position clearly, in a regulatory contract situation
like this one the Secretary is without authority to
decide he or she can't enforce the statute and to confer
expressly by contract third-party beneficiary rights to
the -- to the people receiving the benefit? That's the
position you're taking?
If the Secretary had written a provision
into this contract telling 340B entities you can sue,
that would have been, according to you, ultra vires?
MS. ANDERS: I think it would be difficult
to say that the agency would have been totally without
authority to do that. It's not a question you have to
answer here, because I think the PPA clearly shouldn't
be construed to confer third-party beneficiary rights
because that would be inconsistent with the statutory
scheme.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice.
I'd like to start with Ms. Blatt's answer to
your question about whether a provision of the agreement
here could confer third-party beneficiary rights. She
said yes, so long as the wording wasn't specifically
prescribed by Congress. In so doing, she concedes that
this is a contract, that normal rules of contract law
apply, that the fact that the Secretary has entered into
the contract is of no moment, and that third-party
beneficiary rights are an inherent part of normal
contract principles.
So now we're left with the question, does it
matter that Congress wrote the particular words that the
Secretary used in the agreement?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Is the --
MR. FREDERICK: We submit that the answer is
JUSTICE SCALIA: Third-party beneficiary
rights are part of normal contracts, but the third-party
beneficiary has rights under -- under the normal
contract only when the parties intend him to have
rights. It's not that every -- every contract which --
which has a benefit for some person allows that person
to sue. There has to be an intent. And I -- I have
trouble finding that intent here, either on the -- on
the part of the Secretary -- would the Secretary have
had that intent when -- when Congress clearly did -- did
not have the intent to allow private individuals to sue?
MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, you find the
intent in part II(a) of the agreement, which is set
forth in the petition appendix. And in part II(a), the
manufacturer who agrees voluntarily to enter into this
agreement agrees that the entity -- that the entity will
be charged only a set ceiling price.
That is a voluntary agreement of a duty by
the manufacturer that runs to the third-party
beneficiary covered entities --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you didn't -- you
didn't hear my question.
MR. FREDERICK: -- who are specified in the
agreement.
JUSTICE SCALIA: My question was the mere
fact that there's a duty to a third party in the normal
contract does not give that third party the right to
sue, only if the contracting parties intend the
third-party beneficiary to have a right to sue.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, that's not the
standard, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought the --
MR. FREDERICK: The standard for a
third-party beneficiary, as set forth in the Restatement
and as recognized by this Court, is whether or not the
parties objectively intended to create intended
third-party beneficiaries whose right to bring the suit
would enforce the contract. And that's precisely what
we have here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me where --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I thought when this
case went back to the -- to the district court, the --
the agency's position was this is a total surprise to
us, 14,000 suits or whatever it is. No, we never -- we
never envisioned making the individual whatever you call
them -- the 430B --
MR. FREDERICK: The 340B entities.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: We never envisioned
making them the beneficiaries and -- and allowing them
to sue. That would be quite disruptive of our program.
That, I thought, was the position the Government took.
MR. FREDERICK: The Government cannot argue
for subjective intent of an agreement written 18 years
ago. This Court's decisions in contract have always
held that the objective intent as expressed by the words
of the contract are what courts are to construe.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I don't
understand why what Justice Scalia said isn't the same
as what you said. You said no, Justice Scalia,
Restatement of Contracts. But what he said the question
is whether or not did the parties intend -- and it's an
objective intent -- to confer these rights on a third
person. And -- and you said no, no, that's not it. But
then it seems to me that your answer that you gave was
just what Justice Scalia said. I -- I missed something.
MR. FREDERICK: Okay. Here's what I think I
misunderstood perhaps from Justice Scalia's question.
For third-party beneficiary rights to create an
enforceable breach of contract claim, the parties to the
contract do not have to have a provision in the contract
saying "and therefore the intended third parties get to
bring a breach of contract claim." That's never been
the accepted law.
The law has always said if the parties
intend to create third-party beneficiaries and bringing
of that suit to enforce the contract would be within the
objective intent of the parties, such a suit is
permissible.
Now, I want to caution that what is
different about this suit from the kinds of implied
rights of action suits that the drug companies here
claim to be so disruptive is that all we're arguing for
is the bargain that the manufacturers agreed to
undertake.
JUSTICE ALITO: Could that be -- could there
be --
MR. FREDERICK: That bargain was -- was the
discount. It's the delta between what the counties paid
and what they should have paid under the discount
program ceiling price arrangement in the plain terms of
the agreement.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could there be --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Third-party -- I'm
sorry.
JUSTICE ALITO: Could there be a
third-party -- a suit by an intended beneficiary and a
purported intended beneficiary, if it is clear that
Congress intended, to the extent it can intend
something, for those beneficiaries to get the benefit of
the price but did not intend for them to be able to sue?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO: So if there were --
MR. FREDERICK: I think indirectly here,
Justice Alito, that the patients here certainly are
incidental beneficiaries, insofar as those who can't
afford to pay for the drugs get them for free at the
county's expense. This is county money that we're
talking about here. Or if they have some limited
insurance, they're able to get the drugs at a discount.
So they are certainly incidental
beneficiaries, but because they are not named and
because the intent of the program is to provide the 340B
entities with discounted drugs so they can extend scarce
dollars farther, they have no right to sue.
JUSTICE ALITO: If there were a provision in
the law saying expressly there is no private right of
action under this statute, would you be able to make the
same argument?
MR. FREDERICK: No. Our argument rests on
the silence of contract with respect to how enforcement
would concur. It has long been the case, though, that
where the parties intend to displace a third-party
beneficiary's rights, the objective intent of the -- of
the agreement is what is understood.
JUSTICE ALITO: There's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -- I'm sorry.
don't understand the distinction that you're ignoring in
the law. I thought it was very clear that proof that
you merely received the benefit in a -- by a contract is
not proof that the parties intended to confer on you an
enforceable right; is that correct? Is that the
statement of the common law?
MR. FREDERICK: That is how the Restatement
frames it. It's a -- it is a difficult line I think
sometimes to understand the difference between an
intended beneficiary and an incidental beneficiary.
Certainly, the manufacturers here are incidental
beneficiaries --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No matter how --
MR. FREDERICK: -- because they have access
to this market.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No matter how you want
to draw this line, if the issue is what's the objective
intent about enforceability, if I look at the PPA, it
makes the manufacturer's obligation one-way to the
government to provide the pricing information. It gives
only the government the right to institute the informal
dispute resolution system that the contract specifies.
This is not the new law. This is the PPA as it existed
at the time. It gives only the Secretary other
enforcement rights.
What am I missing? Where in the contract is
there one provision, one sentence, one anything that
requires the manufacturers, other than the price
benefit, to do something that could be characterized as
enforcement?
MR. FREDERICK: But that is the key,
Justice Sotomayor. The price discount is where all the
action is in this program. These prices, between 1990
and 1992, were being raised by the drug manufacturers as
against these entities, and the whole point of Congress
enacting this statute was to confer the same discounted
drug program to the covered entities as had been done
through contracts to the State Medicaid rebate program.
And that's why the provision in the
amendment -- sorry, in the agreement that says thou
shalt not charge the covered entities more than the
ceiling price is exactly where you find the intended
third-party beneficiary rights, because that's their
money that's being spent. It's not Federal --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true -- that's
true, you know, of -- I was thinking maximum resale
price maintenance. You could -- the distributor and the
manufacturer agree on the maximum resale price. Pretty
unlikely that they intend the consumers who are intended
to benefit to be able to have a lawsuit. And I think,
well, gee, I don't know. And what the Government is
arguing is, sure, the point you make favors you, but
they say there are two major points here that favor them
about background. I want to hear what your reply is.
One of them is Congress, in the statute that
it incorporated here, didn't want a private person to be
able to enforce it. And the second one is it's going to
create a mess. All right? So they say those are two
background features here that favor them.
So what's your response?
MR. FREDERICK: Number one, there's no
evidence that Congress intended there to be a departure
from normal operating contract principles, and this
Court, in Winstar, in Mobil Oil, in Jackson Transit, in
Central Airlines -- all said that when Congress uses
contracts or agreements, it intends to incorporate the
full cluster of the common law rights as they've
existed. And third-party beneficiary rights have been
recognized for 350 years, even before the founding of
this republic.
Now, as to the disruption, I think it's a
canard, because what we're talking about here is one
price that would govern all 14,500 covered entities. So
if Santa Clara gets the discount price for Lipitor, say,
that is the best price, and it will be charged and
chargeable to all of the 340B entities across the
nation.
So in terms of administrability, one suit
actually can solve the deficiencies in the government
enforcement program, and the government can participate
in this suit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which way does
that cut? That seems to me to put an awful lot of power
and authority in the hands of one beneficiary and one
lawyer saying -- all they have to do is filing a suit
saying, look, we get a hundred doses of Lipitor from
this program; we think we should get less.
And if they win, the whole country's -- the
pricing of Lipitor under this program has changed.
MR. FREDERICK: Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That strikes me as
an argument in favor of leaving the enforcement with the
Secretary.
MR. FREDERICK: No, I think it's an argument
that may misunderstand some of the benefits that class
action practice can provide, where there is a uniform
way of analyzing the problem, because these prices,
Mr. Chief Justice --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't have to
be a class action, does it?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, it doesn't. This was
brought as one for the efficiency purpose of obtaining
exactly the effect that you are identifying, which
is that if it is more efficient --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's why it was
brought as a class action?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, it was brought as a
class action because the County of Santa Clara stands in
exactly the same position as the other 57 counties of
California and the other counties in the United States
who are overpaying for drugs that the manufacturers
are --
JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think
about -- is the -- I'm not sure I'm right at all here,
but as I understand the development of this argument
today, it's open to you and the other 57 counties to go
to the State AG, and you say you bring the lawsuit,
okay? Or make us -- make me -- the lawyer says make me
an assistant AG for this purpose. And I launch the
lawsuit in the name of California, and then I can get to
the same place.
What do you think of that?
MR. FREDERICK: I don't know that the
State -- because these are entities that are not defined
in the agreement. The -- this is a different agreement
than under the Medicaid rebate agreement, which is set
forth in the joint appendix, where the States are the
third-party beneficiaries of those agreements.
I'm not sure that the State actually has
standing to bring these particular claims. That is not
something that has been tested. But what I would say is
that if you reject our argument here, you are
substantially undercutting the ability of the States to
bring the same kinds of overcharging claims against drug
manufacturers under the Medicaid rebate program.
That's what the States' amicus brief here
makes clear. The SG has a very fuzzy footnote at the
very end of the Government's brief that does not set
forth a clear standard that differentiates why 340B
entities' third-party beneficiary rights are any
different from States' rights under the Medicaid rebate
program.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was because
the States have been given a role in the statute itself,
where the 340B entities have not. I thought that was
the -- the Government's position, that the States have a
role in the Medicaid program, and that's an entirely
different thing than this program, where these entities
have no statutory role, say the drug manufacturers and
then HHS.
MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I don't
think that was the basis for Judge Saris's opinion in
the District of Massachusetts, which looked at the
third-party beneficiary theory of the States in giving
them a place at the table in bringing these kinds of
claims. And to the extent that that analysis bears out
anything, it tends to cast doubt on the Government's
theory that these are somehow regulatory contracts that
suggest a blurring of the normal lines between
regulation and contract.
That theory, the regulatory contract theory,
has been rejected by this Court in Winstar and in Mobil
Oil, where the Government tried to argue that because it
was implementing regulatory policy through contracts,
somehow normal contract principles don't apply, and this
Court rejected that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the Government's
footnote doesn't -- doesn't rely on the contract. It
says that -- and it wasn't purporting to say the basis
that the court applied in the District of Massachusetts
case, but it was explaining why, in the Government's
view, it's a different situation.
And what it said, it's a different
situation, not because of a different contract, but
because in that other situation, Medicaid -- the
Medicaid rebate -- Medicaid generally is, quote, "a
cooperative Federal-State program."
I mean, their point is that the States are
explicitly given authority for enforcement in that.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And here the entities
you're representing are not.
MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, and that is
why resort to the normal canons of construction that
this Court has long applied to government contracts is
what is most pertinent here. The Government, I don't
think, can point to a specific provision of the
cooperative federalism that empowers States to engage in
any greater enforcement power than a normal third-party
beneficiary under this Court's normal cases, and back to
Central Airlines and American Surety, which, a hundred
years ago, recognized a third-party beneficiary's right
to bring suit on a breach of contract and held that the
absence of a specific enforcement power in the statute
was not enough to deny the normal operation of law for
the breached party to sue for that breach.
That's common in the law.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The big -- the big
difference, it seems to me, Mr. Frederick, is that the
States are sovereign. They can enforce their own laws.
The entities at issue here are not sovereigns. They're
not enforcing their own laws. They are trying to
enforce Federal law. But under the -- under the
Medicaid program, the States, using their own fraud --
fraud actions, whatever else, have a role to play.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Scalia, I
think if you took that argument to its logical extreme,
you would have come to a different answer in the Arthur
Andersen case, where, there, you recognized a
third-party beneficiary's right to invoke a statute to
get an arbitration agreement upheld.
And I think you would have come to a
different result in the Miree v. DeKalb County case, in
which the Court said that just because there is an FAA
contract with a local airport authority does not deny a
third-party beneficiary right to sue if there is an
adverse effect on adjoining land because you would have
said that, because the adjoining land owner had no
specific enforcement authority, that person or entity
would be out of luck. I think the -- this Court's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's Miree.
That's 1977. And a lot of your argument, it seems to
me, is in the earlier world of implied right of action
jurisprudence that has changed dramatically in the last
years.
And what concerns me is when you are talking
about the same language, the mere fact that the
government has decided to go through a contractual
mechanism to advance this program doesn't allow you to
use that to get an end run around all of the implied
right of action jurisprudence of the last 30 years.
You're on stronger ground before that.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, let me address that
directly, Mr. Chief Justice, because Justice Rehnquist,
who was not any fan of implied rights of action, was the
author for the Court's opinion in the Miree decision.
And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that was
pretty well -- that analysis was certainly consistent
with the established jurisprudence in this area then.
But it started changing very quickly thereafter -- I
think about 1980 -- and then consistently went in the
other direction, to the point now where I think the
jurisprudence is pretty clear that we're not going to
imply a private right of action at all.
MR. FREDERICK: We're not asking you to
imply a private right of action, Mr. Chief Justice.
We're asking you to honor contract principles that have
long --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The result is the same,
Mr. Frederick. And that's -- I mean, it was a central
point in this last brief. You can call it whatever you
want. It's -- Congress has not provided for a private
right of action to enforce the terms of the statute.
The contract embodies the terms of statute. So it would
be passing strange if Congress, as we now read Congress,
said we want private parties out of this; this is to be
between the agency and the manufacturer to say. The
same exact result. The same aim can be achieved through
this third-party beneficiary route. And I think that
said, that is the -- I mean, that is what stands out
about this case.
And so how do you respond to that? What's
the difference between suing because the statute has
been violated and suing because the contract has been
violated?
MR. FREDERICK: A contract is a voluntary
agreement entered into between the drug manufacturer and
the Secretary. The manufacturer can choose not to
participate.
So in every one of the implied right of
action cases that you have dealt with, a -- an outside
entity has been forced to comply with a statute or law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the statute wouldn't
apply to someone who doesn't want to be in the program.
MR. FREDERICK: But the -- Justice Ginsburg,
those cases all involve the imposition of duties on the
part of an entity or actor out in society.
Here we're talking about voluntary action.
The drug manufacturers can decide not to participate and
not sign the agreement.
And they have the right, under the
provisions allowing termination, to terminate the
agreement at will with no reason whatsoever. But --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But so do the --
it's the same situation with the States under Spending
Clause legislation. They don't have to sign up, but if
they do, then the issue is, is there an implied right of
action on the beneficiaries? And our cases for the last
, 30 years have said no.
MR. FREDERICK: But the remedy is different,
Mr. Chief Justice. And that is a key difference. All
we're talking about here as a remedy is the difference
between what they promised to charge and what they
actually charged. The remedies --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're told that
whatever you say -- that's all we're talking about. We
are told that computing the price is a very intricate
business and that many of these disputes have been about
what is -- what should the ceiling price be.
MR. FREDERICK: There --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There would not -- the
ceiling price is out there, and there's no dispute about
it. It's just a question of getting the manufacturers
to charge that price and not a higher price. The
question is: What is the ceiling price?
MR. FREDERICK: And there are two ways to
calculate it. Under the more complicated formula that
is designed to enhance the profits of the drug
companies, it is a more complicated endeavor.
All of these cases, Justice Ginsburg, all of
them, have been with the simple formula, which is has
the drug company given its best price to some other
purchaser in the market. That's where the False Claims
Act cases that they acknowledge do not create such an
intrusion into the program that somehow they can't be
brought --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- and then
they have control over them. And they don't have
control over these suits.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, no, the difference in
a qui tam case, as your question earlier to my colleague
earlier acknowledged, Justice Ginsburg, is the
government doesn't have to intervene in a False Claims
Act case.
What's different there is that there has to
be some inside whistleblower who can pass through the
very difficult hurdles of a False Claims Act case;
whereas here we're talking about benefit of the bargain.
The manufacturers agreed by contract they were only
going to charge a ceiling price, and we assert, based
on, you know, quite extensive reports by officers of
Inspectorate General that they have not been charging
that price. They've been charging in excess of that
price, and all we're asking for is the delta.
And the Government in its Massachusetts
submissions has acknowledged that this type of best
price litigation is not so complicated because all one
needs to do is figure out did the drug companies sell
the particular drug to some other entity for a lower
price; and if that's so, that's the price you apply
across the board to all the 340B entities.
The argument about distraction and
intrusion, Justice Ginsburg, I would respectfully
submit, is a gross overstatement of what actually
happens in this type of litigation. And to the extent
that there are complexities, the complexities are
introduced by the drug companies for the sole purpose of
masking what price they are charging to the 340B
entities. Because all these various mechanisms, the
bundling of drugs, the use of kickbacks and payments to
purchasers are all designed to mask what the true price
of the drug is.
And if Congress intended anything in the
program, and in getting the Secretary to implement this
program through statutes, it was that the 340B entities
who are providing drugs and medical service to the
poorest of our citizens should be entitled to the
benefits of the collective market created by these 340B
drug purchases. And that's all that we're asking for
here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you take the position
that nothing has changed as a result of the new
legislation? That is, Ms. Anders told us that this
statute is going into -- to become effective. There's
going to be procedures, better procedures than there
were before. Is there still this third-party
beneficiary suit, despite the possibility of going to
the agency?
MR. FREDERICK: We don't know, Justice
Ginsburg, is the simple and plainest answer I can give
you. And the reason we don't know is because the
Secretary has already missed the first statutory
deadline for issuing implementing regulations.
There was no statement of rules in the
notice of proposed rulemaking, as is ordinarily the case
for agencies. The Secretary simply put out for comment
that we are going to develop procedures and rules. So
we don't know whether or not the Secretary will express
some further intent as to how these new rules are to
apply.
But I would submit that this Court's cases
are very clear, that a later enactment of Congress is
not intent of what an earlier Congress has stated, and
the absence of any specific remedial provision coupled
with the use of agreements carries with it the ordinary
presumption that Congress intended for that cluster of
common law rights to be associated with the agreement.
And that's certainly been the way this Court
has enforced contracts involving the government itself.
If there are no further questions, we'll
submit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Frederick.
Ms. Blatt, you have 3 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. BLATT: Yes. If I could just talk about
the drug companies, Lipitor, and the common law. And if
you want, I can also talk about States.
We take, obviously, deep umbrage at the
suggestion that the drug companies are somehow against
these clinics. Any Internet search will show you that
the amount of discounts given under this program equals
the amount of free drugs that are given to these same
clinics.
And I'd also -- probably even a better
response is you can look at any rebate release issued by
the Secretary of HHS or any page of their CFR, and if
you think it's simple, I would be shocked.
On Lipitor, it's not the case that the
Central District of California decides nationwide what
the price of Lipitor is. The -- under the other side's
view, the Southern District of Texas, the Northern
District of New York, and the District in Alabama would
all decide.
And what's really bad -- it is bad enough to
have 14,000 suits over 35,000 drugs, but what he's
talking about, best price and average manufacturer price
that determines the State rebate program -- because the
rebate program is a rebate, and the ceiling price
program is a ceiling price, when one of the pricing
components goes up, such as average manufacturer price,
the States benefit. They get more money. But,
generally, 340B entities -- their ceiling price goes up.
So what's good for the 340B company -- or entity is bad
for the States.
And that's not disputed. He just says it's
hypothetical. But he's asked for millions and millions
and millions and millions and more millions of
transactions that go to that very pricing component.
Common law. On pages 9 to 11a of the
petition appendix is a good three or four citations to
the third-party beneficiary Federal common law. And the
courts go out of their way to say it's not enough to be
a direct beneficiary. The analysis is exactly the same
under implied right of action. Is there clear and
unambiguous intent to confer enforceable rights? It's
the same.
We just think because it's in haec verba
with the statute, it's congressional intent that's
controlling, not the parties.
I could talk about States if you want.
Otherwise, I'm happy to just ask for the decision to be
reversed.
All right. Then we would ask that the
decision be reversed.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the
