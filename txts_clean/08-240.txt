CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear argument

Service v. Shell Oil Products, and the consolidated case.
Mr. Lamken.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN
ON BEHALF OF SHELL OIL PRODUCTS
COMPANY, LLC, ET AL.
MR. LAMKEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
Congress enacted the PMPA to regulate two
specific, but important, actions: Franchisors'
termination of the franchise prior to the conclusion of
the franchise term and the franchisors’ non-renewal of
the franchise relationship at the end of the agreement's
term.
The statute responded to complaints about
franchisors exercising broad contractual rights to
terminate the franchise relationship that was not
addressed by -- for trivial violations or at will, that
was not previously addressed by State law. But Congress
left all other aspects of the franchise relationship to
State law.
Because the term "terminate," at the very
least, requires an end, we and the United States agree
that the First Circuit erred in upholding a so-called
constructive termination, where the dealers continued to
receive each element of the statutory franchise -- that
is the premises, the trademark, and fuel --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Lamken, am I wrong that
you don't really object to the recognition of
“constructive termination,” if that phrase is used the
way it is used elsewhere in contract law?
MR. LAMKEN: We don't believe that in contract
law constructive termination exists or in the analogous
State franchise statutes that existed at the time that
the Congress enacted the PMPA.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I thought -- I thought
that if you had a lease and the landlord fails to
provide heat, that you can move out and he will be
deemed to have constructively evicted you.
MR. LAMKEN: That's right. The term
"constructive eviction" we would -- we believe does
exist, along with "constructive discharge." But the
precise terms that Congress used here were "terminate,"
"non-renew," and "cancel," which are drawn from the law
of contracts and the U.C.C., in particular, and from
State franchise statutes. We --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- on that point,
the government differs with you. The government says,
as Justice Scalia suggested, there can be such a thing
as constructive termination, and you must terminate.
MR. LAMKEN: Yes. It's not so much that we
differ; it's that our fallback position is the same as
the government's, but they do not endorse our primary
position, which is that there is no such thing as
constructive termination.
We believe it would be a mistake to recognize
constructive termination in this context for three
reasons: The first is the one I already mentioned, is
that, in the most analogous context that existed at the
time Congress acted, State franchise statutes that used
terms like "terminate," "non-renew," "cancel," the terms
that Congress used, there was -- the notion of
constructive termination was frankly unheard of.
Even today, under those statutes it is not a
well-accepted concept, having been rejected by
approximately half the States to have considered it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but all -- under
one view, all the dealer is doing is mitigating damages.
In other words, the deal is off. He's in effect been
terminated. You're saying, well then, he has to pack up
and leave. He can stay and still reduce the damages you
are going to have to pay.
MR. LAMKEN: On the contrary, Your Honor.
It's not so much -- there isn't a mitigation of damages,
any more than an employee claiming constructive
discharge, for example, would be mitigating damages by
staying in her job. The settled rule, even when
constructive claims are recognized, is that an employee
claiming --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there --
MR. LAMKEN: -- constructive discharge must
move out, must quit the job, and the tenant claiming
constructive eviction must leave the job. That is the
nature, even where constructive discharge and
constructive termination -- constructive eviction
claims, are recognized. That is the settled rule.
If you have something else, for example,
there’s a breach of contract, you can claim your breach
of contract, and you can sue for damages while
continuing to operate. But if you're going to claim
that it wasn't a mere breach of contract, but in fact it
was a constructive termination, that you've lost all the
rights to continue to operate -- you may not get fuel,
you may not get --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've lost the
rights to operate at a particular level. In other
words, if they say -- I don't know how the deal works,
but, you know, you've got to charge $10 a gallon or, you
know, you've got to close the convenient mart or
whatever, you have lost the right to operate at that.
The terms of the lease under which you were operating
have been effectively terminated. That doesn't mean you
can't still make money, and it doesn't mean you have to
give that up, but --
MR. LAMKEN: Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but the deal has
been terminated.
MR. LAMKEN: I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you
have confused breach with termination. The failure to
give the rights on the terms provided in the lease or
the agreement would be a breach of contract. But
termination in contract law has long been understood to
be something entirely different, which is the absolute
refusal to provide the elements such that it's obvious
to any observer that there is -- these elements will not
be resumed.
Corbin on Contracts, for example, describes
termination as occurring "when either party, pursuant to
a power created by agreement or law, puts an end to the
contract,” “extinguishing future obligations of both
parties to the agreement."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What did Williston say
about it? Contract --
MR. LAMKEN: Pardon.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does Williston
say about it?
MR. LAMKEN: Williston didn't actually address
that. Corbin addresses it because he talks about the
U.C.C., and the U.C.C. in turn says: "On termination,
all obligations" --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is leaving the
premises the sine quo non of a termination?
MR. LAMKEN: It's the sine qua non of any
termination under this statute, we would believe, if you
recognize constructive termination.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But aren't there -- aren't
there some operators that own their own premises?
MR. LAMKEN: That's right. That's why it
would have to be a determination of one of the three
franchise elements. The way the statute's written, each
of the different --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So only one of the three
would suffice in your view?
MR. LAMKEN: That's right. Each of these
separate elements is treated as a franchise, and you can
have the termination of any one of the three, and that
is a termination of the franchise --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just --
MR. LAMKEN: -- defined within the agreement.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just testing your view,
suppose there are two franchisees, and in each case the
oil company reduces the amount they're paying for the
gas. One franchisee can't afford it, leaves, quits --
termination. The other franchisee has a considerable
amount of savings, and he protests, but he stays in
business. Different result?
MR. LAMKEN: Well, in our view the result
would be the same in both. Neither of those would be a
termination, because --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. In my first, he
ceases to operate and he moves out of the premises.
MR. LAMKEN: Right. In our view it has to be
the franchisor that terminates, not the franchisee. But
if one accepts the construct of the constructive
termination, those would be different results, because,
at the very least, termination requires an end to one of
the franchise elements. And the individual who sues,
having not -- having -- still receiving all the
franchise elements, hasn't been terminated in any sense
of the word.
But the key thing is he actually has a breach
of contract action. Raising the price unreasonably on
an open price term has long, uniformly, comprehensively
been addressed by State law, like U.C.C. 2-305.
So the answer always is you can sue for
breach of contract. And Congress wasn't worried about
the fact there might be breaches of contract that
ordinary contract remedies don't sufficiently remedy.
Congress's concern was the exercise of contractually
broad rights to terminate and non-renew the
relationship. And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the government comes up
here, as I think they will in a few minutes, and tells
us that there is such a thing as constructive
termination, do you know what hypothetical they give us
to illustrate how that would work? I mean, it's their
argument, but I'm curious. I will be curious to know
how you would respond to that.
MR. LAMKEN: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, there is a
small universe of cases in which there is a constructive
termination without leaving the premises, without
severing the fuel, et cetera.
MR. LAMKEN: I don’t --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just don't know what
they're going to -- how you would respond to that?
MR. LAMKEN: Yes. I think the government
doesn't think that constructive termination extends to
cases where you continue to receive all three franchise
elements. They would believe that constructive
termination requires at least one of those three
elements to end, just as it does --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your position is that the
franchisor has to be the one to terminate?
MR. LAMKEN: That's our position, yes. The
franchisor has to be the one that exercises the
termination. The notion of constructive termination,
where the franchisee effectively abandons the premises
in response to conditions it thought intolerable, that
that is a constructive termination, and it was not a
concept that existed under the most analogous statutes
under the contract law from which the terms
"termination," “non-renewal” --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that the franchisor can
do outrageous things -- triple the rent, double the
price of the fuel -- and you would say, even so, there’s
-- that doesn't count as a termination because the
franchisor hasn't terminated?
MR. LAMKEN: That's right, and precisely
because all those things were comprehensively and
uniformly addressed by contract law, uniform contract
law. The --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you'd just have a
magic words test.
MR. LAMKEN: No, it does not reduce -- I mean,
because we -- we agree that there can be a termination
by deed as well as by words. For example, the outright
refusal to provide the fuel, provide fuel at all, would
be a termination. You don't have to say we are hereby
rescinding all of your rights under the contract. At
some point, it becomes obvious, clear to any observer.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but what happens after
that? Don't you take the position that the station
owner then has to refuse all other elements of the
contract, right?
MR. LAMKEN: If -- no, our position would be
that where the station owner abandons in response, that
would not be an actual termination. The government
would take the view that that’s a constructive
termination.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, wait, wait --
MR. LAMKEN: And the problem this gets you --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said there is a
termination by the company if it fails to provide one of
the three basic elements, right?
MR. LAMKEN: Yes, that is correct, Justice
Scalia.
--
JUSTICE SCALIA: That is a termination?
MR. LAMKEN: That is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What response has to be made
by the station owner? Anything?
MR. LAMKEN: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: He can continue to take the
other two elements?
MR. LAMKEN: Well, it's particularly -- I
mean, since the franchise is described as having three
elements --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes or no?
MR. LAMKEN: He can continue taking the other
two elements.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And there has still been a
termination?
MR. LAMKEN: Well, there has been a
termination of the franchise, which is defined as having
three -- effectively three separate franchise
agreements. Each of the different elements is treated
like it's a different contract or a different agreement.
So if you terminate one, there has been a termination of
the franchise, because the franchise is defined to
encompass all three elements. You’ve got to get --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the government’s
JUSTICE SCALIA: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is all one contract, isn't it? You are saying --
MR. LAMKEN: No --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying you can
terminate a third of the contract?
MR. LAMKEN: Yes. Oftentimes these are in
separate contracts, and in this case there are actually
two contracts as opposed to three. And, yes, the way
the statute's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And they are not contingent
on each other, so that at any time the company could
terminate one of them and stick the station owner with
the other two?
MR. LAMKEN: Well, one could imagine a
situation where the trademark is withdrawn, but you can
continue to be a lessee of the premises and market the
fuel as an unbranded --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not continues to be. You
must continue to be.
MR. LAMKEN: Yes. But the contract could be
written that way, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That sounds like a very
strange way to write the contract.
MR. LAMKEN: Well, the way Congress wrote the
statute was to define the franchise --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about writing
the statute. I'm talking about writing the contract.
MR. LAMKEN: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really think that
that's how those contracts should be interpreted?
MR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, sometimes they are,
for very good reasons, written as independent contracts
and sometimes they will be dependent contracts,
depending on the nature of the relationship between the
parties.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is -- what is the
difference between your understanding of an implicit
termination, which is what I take it you have just been
describing, and a constructive termination?
MR. LAMKEN: I think an implicit termination
is one that’s objectively viewed as ending the nature of
the relationship of the parties. The contract's over.
You no longer have the right. Fuel will not be coming.
You may not use our trademark, or you may no longer use
our premises.
A constructive termination, as I understand
the concept, could be something -- and this is the
difficulty with the concept -- something like charging
too much, an excessive price, which is a breach of
contract, which would prevent a reasonable franchisee
from continuing to accept that element.
JUSTICE ALITO: So if the franchisor
completely refuses to supply gas, that's an implicit
termination?
MR. LAMKEN: That's as good as --
JUSTICE ALITO: But if he charges $1,000 a
gallon, that's not a termination?
MR. LAMKEN: Right. That's correct. And the
difficulty is -- that would be a breach of contract
remediable under State law. And the difficulty is, the
moment you move this into the issue of price, suddenly
the issue of price -- how much the franchisor can charge
is a question of Federal law, in a statute that just
talks about termination and non-renewal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you -- you put
forth this dichotomy between breach of contract and
constructive termination. I don't know why something
can't be both.
MR. LAMKEN: Oh, in fact, in order to be
constructive termination, something would have to be a
breach of contract. I think the government would
concede that. It has to be wrongful. For example,
insisting on your ordinary contractual rights cannot be
a constructive termination. It must also be a breach of
contract, which is precisely why it doesn't add very
much to -- it’s unlikely that Congress intended to
incorporate it, because those things that already
breached the contract were already addressed by State
law. There was no --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And could you, Mr. Lamken,
straighten out what happened in the district court?
Because I take it there was an award for breach of
contract as well as one for termination and they were in
an identical amount. So what happened to the breach of
contract?
MR. LAMKEN: Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The award?
MR. LAMKEN: The actual damages here -- the
amounts were overlapping. And so everything that they
will recover, the amounts of compensation recovered for
termination, are covered by the breach of contract
claim. The difference between the two is about
$1.4 million worth of attorney's fees and expert costs
that are covered by the PMPA, but would not be provided
under contract law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a rather significant
difference.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What does the company have to
do in your view to effect a genuine termination and not
a constructive termination?
MR. LAMKEN: It may do -- one, issue the
notice that’s required, say that they are terminating,
that this is -- in the words of contract, we are
extinguishing the future operations; or they can engage
in conduct which an objectively reasonable observer
would have to understand gives that exact same message.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that constructive
termination?
MR. LAMKEN: No, it's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the conduct is you
stopped sending me the gas you are supposed to send me.
MR. LAMKEN: It's an actual termination. And
the problem is, once you get into -- you get into
constructive termination, you get the question of:
Well, is it a constructive termination to raise the
price by 1 percent or, as the case entirely involves
market --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand what
your number two consists of unless it consists of an act
that the other side would call constructive -- or the
government would call constructive termination.
MR. LAMKEN: I think sometimes there is an
unclear line between what some people call an implicit
or informal actual termination --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MR. LAMKEN: -- and what other people would
call a constructive termination.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think there’s always an
unclear line between those two.
MR. LAMKEN: But I don't think -- in the
highly unusual case of $1,000 per gallon or things like
that, that might be the case. But in the ordinary cases
you see a 1 percent increase in gas prices in highly
volatile petroleum markets. For example, in this case,
where Shell raised its prices considerably but was still
charging less than Exxon and Chevron, as the joint
appendix 225 and 237 made clear, that's what you end up
with as claims for constructive termination, if you
recognize constructive termination.
But Congress was worried about actual
terminations, the exercise of contractual rights, broad
contractual rights, to terminate that were formerly not
regulated, not breaches of contract that were already
regulated by -- comprehensively, by State law.
If I may reserve the remainder of my time for
rebuttal. Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. O'Neil.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID O'NEIL
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING SHELL OIL PRODUCTS COMPANY, LLC, ET AL.
MR. O'NEIL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
The government agrees with Shell that, because
there was no termination or non-renewal in any
meaningful sense of the word, the dealers failed to
state a claim under the PMPA. But, Justice Ginsburg,
you are correct: The government parts company with
Shell about what the term -- word "termination," does
cover. Shell would limit the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When would you -- when
would you measure your constructive termination? At
what point would the statute of limitations begin to run
or stop under your definition?
MR. O'NEIL: When the franchisee is actually
forced to end one of the statutory elements of the
franchise in response to the franchisor's conduct. And
that's the same test that would be applied in the
constructive discharge or constructive eviction context.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you -- you would say
that the franchisee in this situation would have had to
say: I can't pay the increased amount of rent without
the subsidy; I'm going to stop.
MR. O'NEIL: That's correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm going to leave the
premises.
MR. O'NEIL: That's correct. And that is the
same rule that -- that would apply to any other --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what about the
statutory right for a preliminary injunction? When
would that right kick in, in this situation?
MR. O'NEIL: It --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because the preliminary
injunction stops the change of a contract price -- of a
contract term, obviously, or it continues it. So when
-- at what point would --
MR. O'NEIL: If a franchisee is faced with
franchisor conduct that will leave the franchisee with
no alternative but to abandon a statutory element, then
the franchisee in that situation can go in and say that
he is in the equivalent position to someone who has
received a piece of paper saying: You are hereby
terminated. And we would say that for purposes of
seeking preliminary injunctive relief, that the
franchisee can claim that he has been terminated for
those purposes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And for -- if for whatever
reason the judge says no at the preliminary injunction
stage, that's the end of it; the franchisee just has to
leave the premises?
MR. O'NEIL: Well, a judge would only deny a
preliminary injunction if either there were no serious
question going to the merits on the termination question
or if the balance of hardships did not tip in the
franchisee's favor. And then the franchisee would be in
a very difficult position to claim that it was in some
kind of catch-22, because by definition the judge would
have found that the franchisor is in a worse condition
by having to continue the relationship.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the franchisor stops
delivering gas. There are three -- three different
obligations under the contract. What does the
franchisee have to do to show that he has accepted it as
a termination? Why does he have to leave the premises?
That's another contract, is -- is what the --
MR. O'NEIL: Justice Scalia, we -- we agree
with Shell on this. The statute defines "franchise" by
three elements: The supply of fuel, the use of the
leased premises, and the use of the trademark. So
someone who is still on a gas station premises that had
the Shell sign above them but that had no fuel would not
be operating a gas station franchise, and that would be
a termination even if the franchisee did not actually
pick up and leave the premises. So we would call that a
termination.
JUSTICE ALITO: If the conduct on the part of
the franchisor is raising the price of gas, how does the
factfinder determine whether it's sufficient to justify
a constructive termination? And assume that the
franchisee leaves -- the price of gas is raised, and
this particular franchisee says: I can't operate if gas
is sold to me at that price. What's the standard for
determining whether there was a constructive
termination?
MR. O'NEIL: The test is, first of all,
whether the franchisor's conduct was wrongful -- in
other words, in violation of the agreement between the
parties; and whether a reasonable franchisee in those
circumstances would have no alternative but to do what
that franchisee did and to abandon the premises.
JUSTICE ALITO: But what's a reasonable
franchisee in that situation? Presumably some have a
small profit margin; some have a bigger profit margin.
Some could operate if the price of gas is raised; some
could not. How is that to be determined?
MR. O'NEIL: Well, it's the same kind of
question that juries ask all the time -- juries answer
all the time in constructive discharge and constructive
eviction cases.
Indeed, we think it may be easier to answer
that question in this context, because constructive
discharge and constructive eviction will often turn on
intangible psychological factors like the level of
indignity that an employee would suffer before leaving
his job. Gas station franchises are operated for -- to
make money, and if it would be impossible for a
franchisee to do that, then a reasonable franchisee in
those circumstances would have no choice but to --
JUSTICE ALITO: You are putting a jury in sort
of the situation of a -- of a rate regulator, aren't
you, if you do that?
MR. O'NEIL: No.
JUSTICE ALITO: Was it a reasonable rate?
MR. O'NEIL: No. The question is whether it
would be so intolerable -- not whether the rate is fair,
but whether it would be so intolerable that a reasonable
franchisee, a rational franchisee who is economically
motivated, would have any alternative but to abandon it.
And if the franchisee could continue in business, then
it is not a constructive termination. The franchisee
might have a claim for breach of contract, but as long
as -- as long as it would not be a fitting response to
actually abandon the premises, then that is not a
constructive termination.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Up -- up to that point, which
supposedly a jury can find, the tipping point where a
reasonable franchisee would abandon -- up until then, he
has a contract claim, right? And then at that magical
point, the contract claim is converted into a claim
under the statute?
MR. O'NEIL: When --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't the contract claim
alone enough?
MR. O'NEIL: Well, Justice Scalia, the whole
point of the PMPA was that State law remedies were
inadequate in that narrow context where the franchisee's
very existence was threatened.
JUSTICE SCALIA: "In the context of
termination" is what the statute says.
MR. O'NEIL: Yes, and under well-established
background principles of the law that Congress was
drawing on when it enacted the PMPA, termination was not
limited solely to explicit termination.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what are these --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What background principles
were they? I don't know about constructive termination.
There was constructive discharge and constructive
eviction. But --
MR. O'NEIL: The relationship here is in
essence one of landlord and tenant. And so it was
natural for Congress to draw on that body of law, as
well as the body of law governing the termination of
other kinds of relationships like employment, for the
meaning of the -- of "termination" under the PMPA.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. O'Neil, I thought that
there were some cases, landlord-tenant cases, where the
tenant is not required to leave the premises because, as
awful as the situation is, the tenant has no place to
MR. O'NEIL: Justice Ginsburg, I am not aware
of those cases, and I think the general rule is the one
that -- that is -- is broadly stated in the cases, which
is that if the franchisee -- excuse me, if the tenant
wants to claim constructive eviction, they need to leave
the premises. That is a bedrock principle of the law,
that in order to claim constructive eviction, you
actually have to leave.
JUSTICE BREYER: So what happens -- in other
words, suppose the landlord here really wants the guy to
clear out, so he puts thumbtacks on the ground and
horrible-smelling things all over. And then the
franchisee leaves, but the franchisor says: Hey, I
didn't want you to leave; that's your problem. I mean,
that's constructive eviction or constructive
termination?
MR. O'NEIL: That's exactly right, Justice
Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now suppose it's the same
situation, but this person, the franchisee, being quite
indefatigable and daring, finds a way of sneaking
through the barbed wire that has been put up. And
there’s one pump they forgot, and there’s a car that
comes up, and he serves that person. Now is it
constructive eviction?
MR. O'NEIL: No, and that's where --
JUSTICE BREYER: No?
MR. O'NEIL: That's where an objective
standard is important, because we don't look to the
particularly clever --
JUSTICE BREYER: Objective? You’d say any
sensible person would clear out immediately. There are
lions and tigers roaming the gas station.
(Laughter.)
MR. O'NEIL: That's exactly right, and that's
why --
JUSTICE BREYER: And suppose he doesn't,
though, that he doesn't clear out because he's not
sensible, and he just desperately needs the money.
MR. O'NEIL: If the franchisee does not leave,
then he does not state a claim for constructive
termination. And that is how the law operates in every
other area in which this doctrine applies. So if a
civil rights plaintiff claims discrimination on the
basis of race or gender, she cannot stay in her job and
at the same time claim that she was fired. I mean
that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do about the
claim of -- of the -- the Petitioners that only one of
the three contracts has been terminated?
MR. O'NEIL: Well, as I said --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The other two continue --
continue in effect?
MR. O'NEIL: As I said, if one of the three
elements of the -- of the statutory franchise has been
terminated, then that is a termination under the Act.
And that's how the Act defines franchise. It defines it
by all three elements of the franchise, and so if one of
them is terminated, that is a termination.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you -- we often
talk about price adjustments as causing the disputes
between the franchisee and the franchisor. To what
extent in these sets of contracts is the right of the
franchisor to adjust the price controlled by terms of
the contract?
MR. O'NEIL: In general, these are open --
open-term price contracts, so that in these -- in these
leases, for example, Shell had the right to set the
price of fuel using a formula that it formulated in its
discretion.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But is the formula required
by the contract, or it’s just its own discretion to use
the formula?
MR. O'NEIL: It's just in its discretion to
use the formula.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I see.
MR. O'NEIL: It's an open price term. But
U.C.C. 2305 would imply in most contracts a -- a
requirement that, where there is an open price term,
there can't be unreasonable increases in the -- in the
price.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. O'NEIL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Farraher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. FARRAHER, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF MAC'S SHELL SERVICE, INC., ET AL.
MR. FARRAHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
In this case, the jury determined that Shell
and Motiva engaged in conduct designed -- prohibited by
the PMPA when they raised rent to force dealers out of
business and convert their stations to direct
operations. Nevertheless, Shell and Motiva argue that
conduct designed to force the dealers out of business is
insufficient to invoke statutory protection because the
dealers were not deprived of any of the statutory
elements of the franchise, and they remained in business
for some period following the rental increase.
If accepted, the practical effect of Shell and
Motiva's position will allow franchisors to circumvent
the PMPA and terminate franchises at any time, at any
reason, by simply increasing the burden on their
operations.
JUSTICE ALITO: Now, these Petitioners
remained in -- in business, is -- that's right?
MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor --
JUSTICE ALITO: Did they make money during
this period?
MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, some of the
Petitioners --
JUSTICE ALITO: All but one remained in
business, isn't that correct?
MR. FARRAHER: Some of the Petitioners
remained in business, certainly, post-elimination of the
subsidy. The amount of time varied from person to
person.
JUSTICE BREYER: But if they do something
reasonably designed -- a reasonable person would clear
out, then why not clear out?
MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor, we have to
take this in context. This is a -- these are small
business owners who have invested their livelihoods in
operating these franchises. They are trying to keep the
business operational against perhaps all odds and
perhaps --
JUSTICE BREYER: So what's the test?
MR. FARRAHER: Pardon me, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: What's the test? Because if
you say we are going to give an action to a person who
didn't clear out, although the franchisor was trying to
get him to clear out, you are then going to convert into
a Federal action every single breach of contract or
serious breach of contract that there is, which is the
precise opposite of what Congress wanted when it passed
this statute.
So, what is your test as to we know that your
case is the lions and tigers case?
MR. FARRAHER: Justice Breyer, I believe that
you hit on two points: First off, what is the test
sufficient to invoke a constructive termination? And
then, secondly, a point that the panel has addressed is
whether or not abandonment of the franchise is required
by the statute.
JUSTICE BREYER: I wouldn't put it that way.
I’d say constructive termination means you didn't
terminate. Okay? That's what "constructive" means. It
means you didn't do it. But sometimes a franchisor
could act in such a way that the law should treat it as
if he really did. All right? I can imagine a test for
that.
But we have the second problem here, is that
even if the conduct was designed -- it's equal to
terminating it -- this individual didn't leave.
MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: So he was still there running
the business. That's the part I would like to test for.
MR. FARRAHER: The test, Your Honor -- first
off, with respect to whether the conduct is sufficient
to force a termination, we believe the First Circuit's
standard of materiality, which is effective to end one
of the components of the statutorily defined franchise,
is sufficient.
With respect to the second part of your
question, which is why didn't these dealers leave the
station, and --
JUSTICE BREYER: No. I want to know your test
for deciding -- even though the first part is met, how
you apply it when the person didn't leave? I understand
a person who left. He left.
MR. FARRAHER: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: The franchisor says: I
didn't tell him to leave. And then you go look to see
if the franchisor's conduct was so bad, it was the same
as if you told him to leave. I've got that part.
The part I don't have is what happens if he
doesn't leave? Because one thing we know, the conduct
wasn't so bad that this person left, because he didn't
leave. That's that second part that's bothering me.
MR. FARRAHER: And Your Honor, I'm not sure
there’s a test for that, but certainly the statute
doesn't contemplate that the dealer would have to leave.
For example, the injunctive remedy in the statute would
allow a dealer to come in --
JUSTICE BREYER: I need -- the injunctive
remedies in the State court?
MR. FARRAHER: They are different, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right. But the
reason I need a test is because the other side is
saying: I know what the test is; the test is he has to
leave.
MR. FARRAHER: But that --
JUSTICE BREYER: So if you -- if you can show
me some cases or a test or something where he didn't
have to leave, even though the franchisor's conduct was
so bad that a reasonable person would have left, then
I'm on to something and I know where to go.
MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor -- and the point is
that I don't think the franchisee need necessarily leave
as contemplated by the statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Breyer asked you
for a test. Maybe this would help you. If you are the
trial judge, how do you instruct the jury to determine
when there has been a constructive termination? You
have to have an instruction.
MR. FARRAHER: And that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm quite frankly amazed
that you say you don't have a test.
MR. FARRAHER: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You’re coming up here and
telling us that there’s such a thing as a constructive
termination, I mean -- but then you don't have a test
for it?
MR. FARRAHER: We do have a test, Your Honor,
and the test is whether or not the conduct has
effectively eliminated an essential component of one of
the three elements of the franchise. In this case, the
First Circuit used a materiality standard that said that
the lease was effectively ended. And in the context of
the statute, the franchise as defined by the three
elements, what the judge asked the jury to determine
was, was the agreement that Shell entered into with
these franchisees, with the essential component being
the subsidy, was that effectively eliminated --
JUSTICE ALITO: What does that mean,
"effectively eliminated"? The -- the First Circuit
said, if "the breach of the lease was such a material
change that it effectively ended the lease, even though
the plaintiffs continued to operate the business" -- I
have no idea what that means. What does it mean to
effectively end the lease even though the lease
continues?
MR. FARRAHER: Yes, Your Honor, Justice Alito.
The statute contemplates a distinction in the
relationship between a franchise, which is a set of
contracts, and a franchise relationship. A franchise
relationship continues after the expiration of the -- of
the franchise.
In this case here what the judge was charging
the jury was -- what the question was, was the breach of
the lease so material that it effectively ended the --
the agreement that Shell had entered into with its
dealers, regardless of the fact that there was some
relationship that continued with the parties afterwards?
In other words --
JUSTICE ALITO: I know, but could you put that
in somewhat more concrete terms, or can you not get any
more specific than to say the lease is effectively
ended?
MR. FARRAHER: We -- we think that that
certainly was a sufficient standard. The circuit courts
that have decided the issue have arguably employed a
lower standard. They have talked about a breach of one
of the franchise agreements being sufficient. But
certainly we believe the First Circuit set an
appropriate standard here with the materiality being --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any
area of the law, other than this one, if you are right,
in which a termination includes a non-termination; that
is, where a constructive termination includes situations
where the operation continues?
MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, certainly in our --
in our briefs we have referred to cases where
constructive evictions in some settings will allow a
tenant to stay in a premises. Certainly, the -- the
majority of the cases decided in the discharge context
or an eviction setting do require what you have
suggested, which is an end in that the person leaves
their employment or leaves their --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I may be incorrect. I -- I
thought your friends for the Petitioners said there is
no case in which there’s a constructive eviction but
where the lessee remains on the premises. Maybe I
misheard.
What is -- what is your principal case where
the lessee remains on the premises, but there is a
constructive eviction?
MR. FARRAHER: Justice Kennedy, on page 38 of
the main brief in the footnote, we've cited two cases in
New Jersey that allow for that proposition. Certainly,
conceding that the majority of the courts have held that
an -- the tenant leaving the premise in a constructive
eviction setting is a necessary prerequisite to the
claim. But we also recognize that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we -- can -- perhaps
to bring this to more practical terms, you can walk
through with me. I'm going to assume that if a
franchisor changes a rent term and the franchisee
refuses to pay, wouldn't the franchisor at some point
give a notice of termination? What franchisor is going
to sit through months and months and years of waiting
for payment before kicking someone out? Is it -- is
that rationally going to happen in any situation?
MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, I would -- I would
concede that in all likelihood, a franchisor would take
some affirmative conduct, whether that be through a
notice of termination or other step. But, yes, that
would happen.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or -- or, so that in
almost all situations, at least with respect to the
leased premises, in a breach of the leased premises, the
termination would be -- would have to happen.
MR. FARRAHER: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why do we need to make
a constructive eviction theory when, on a practical
basis, there always in this situation has to be a notice
of termination, at least with respect to the premises
part?
MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor, I -- I
respectfully disagree. And I think the government and
Shell would both concede that written notification,
although required by the statute, is not necessarily
always going to be given.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know. But at some point
the franchisor is going to have to take over the
premises, either by trying to evict the person or
locking them out. No -- no rational franchisor is going
to raise rent, not have the franchisee pay, and fail to
terminate the agreement.
MR. FARRAHER: That -- that may be true, Your
Honor. But in this case here what Shell's position is
that they can -- they can -- and -- and put such
intolerable conduct at issue, for example, raising the
rent by several hundred percent, and that doesn't
constitute a termination in any respect, even if -- even
if the dealer were to leave.
They argue that they must affirmatively
withhold one of the statutory elements of the franchise
from the dealer.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the franchisee could
always just stop paying the rent. He doesn't have to
leave the premises.
MR. FARRAHER: That's right, Your Honor. And
again -- again the statute doesn't contemplate -- and --
and we have to, again, go back to the statute to
recognize what the word "termination" means in the
context of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act.
Certainly, Shell envisions that it means that there must
be an end to the relationship.
The Solicitor would concede, I believe, that
the dealer could remain on the premises if there was
such sufficient conduct to force them out of business
that a reasonable person would think they have no
ability to continue in business. But then the Solicitor
imposes a condition that that franchisee must seek an
injunction in order to have a claim under the Act.
Our position is that the injunction is a form
of a relief to protect the franchisee, to maintain the
status quo. But the existence of a claim under the
statute does not depend upon whether or not the
franchisee seeks the injunction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you didn't -- you
didn't -- well, you sought an injunction, but Judge
Zobel thought it was -- it came much too late.
MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, this -- this case
has had a -- a long history to it. The case was
initially filed as In the matter of Tsanikilides in the
U.S. district court and assigned to Judge Zobel. Our
prior counsel did seek an injunction. It's not clear on
the record why that injunction was withdrawn at the time
that the Tsanikilides case was dismissed.
But then when the Marcoux or the Mac's Shell
case was re-filed, it’s correct that the dealers did not
initially move for injunctive relief. And I think there
were two reasons for that. Number one, it was always
contemplated with Judge Zobel that this matter would
proceed on an expedited basis, that discovery would lead
to trial within a very short period of time.
And, number two, even though there is a
relaxed standard for injunctive relief, it was not clear
that the dealers would be able to sufficiently meet
their burden of proof to demonstrate to the court that
an injunction should be issued.
Again, we are dealing here in a practical
effect of asking an oil company on a national basis to
be enjoined from implementing this change in rent that
they had brought about.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain to me --
the question I brought up before -- what was the
difference of the elements between the recovery that the
jury gave for constructive termination and for breach of
contract?
MR. FARRAHER: The damages awarded were
precisely the same, and the judge instructed the jury
that, in fact, there would be no double recovery for
the -- for the dealers here, that they would only
recover once. The breach of contract was pled as an
alternative theory. And the difference being that under
the PMPA the dealers were also awarded their attorneys’
fees and expert witness fees as well, which was a -- a
number north of a million dollars.
JUSTICE BREYER: The problem that -- that I
see here is that if in fact you are right, that the --
the franchisor -- he breached the contract in your view.
Did that breach rise to a termination? Did it rise to
that level?
Now, it's simply a question, since he breached
the contract, of what court you are going to sue in, in
your view. If this isn't a termination, you sue in
State court; if it is a termination, you sue in Federal
court.
So, why -- why wouldn't we say, well, let him
sue in State court, because if the person stays on the
premises, everything becomes blurred. If you require
him to leave the premises, then it's clear. If you were
to let him stay on the premises and also argue it's a
termination, we are going to have people coming into
Federal court because they think there are more damages
or something, I guess, or whatever reason. There will
be a whole lot of unclear cases. So it's better to have
a clear line.
MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor, again, the --
the reason that the dealers are coming to Federal court
is because Congress enacted a statute to protect them --
JUSTICE BREYER: You are going to say they
have a right to, but the other side thinks they don't.
So it doesn't answer my question to just refer to the
fact that you have a right to. My question is a
practical question: What's the harm of sticking to the
clear line that is normally there in other cases, in
this case not depriving your client of a remedy at all?
MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: Just saying he goes to State
court to get it.
MR. FARRAHER: I disagree with the Court that
the client is not being deprived of a remedy. The
remedy available in the statute in one part is
injunctive relief. And while the dealers did not avail
themselves of that in this particular case, the lesser
standard and the lack of a need to show irreparable harm
protects the franchisee under a Federal cause of action
as distinguished from a contractual-based cause of
action.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a million
dollars, right? That's the difference. You get
attorneys’ fees and expert fees in the Federal action,
and presumably you don't in the State action.
MR. FARRAHER: We -- we -- we do in this case,
Mr. Chief Justice. But in a case where a dealer comes
to the court for relief and they have available to them
the injunctive remedy, which does not require the
irreparable harm component be demonstrated, it keeps the
dealer in business. Certainly Congress intended to
protect franchisees. They intended for competition in
the marketplace to continue. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you have the
option, right? If you accept the idea that there’s a
constructive termination under your view, even if you
don't leave, I guess you have the option to stay in
business or to leave at any time.
MR. FARRAHER: They certainly do, Your Honor.
And -- and what happened here, obviously, is that the
oil company imposed such onerous conditions that they
expected dealers would leave. And, in fact, in
Massachusetts within the time period of the
elimination -- the formation of Motiva, within a 5-year
period thereafter, the numbers dropped almost by 50
percent.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you have a choice, you
know. So, here's your choice, dealer: Stay there and
sue in State court, and by the way, if they are charging
you too much money under the contract and you are really
hurting doing -- putting lions and tigers, whatever they
are doing, go get an injunction in State court. See?
They have injunctions in State courts. That exists.
MR. FARRAHER: They certainly do.
JUSTICE BREYER: Or, you have the other
choice. Move out.
MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then if you move out, you can
sue under Federal law, and you will get all these other
things like the extra million dollars or something. So,
move out and get the extra money, or stay there and sue
under State court. Why is that a bad choice?
MR. FARRAHER: It's -- it's a bad choice, Your
Honor, because it puts the dealer in a position of
having to determine whether they should abandon their
lives’ works in order to benefit from a -- from a
Federal cause of action. It's a bad idea because in the
oil company's view, we don't get to make that choice,
even despite their bad conduct unless they affirmatively
stop providing us with one of the -- one of the
statutory elements of the franchise.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, your -- your
approach puts -- puts the company -- the oil company in
a very strange position. It doesn't know whether it has
a contract or not. It -- the contract is terminated if
your client says it's terminated. If he doesn't say
it's terminated, it's not terminated. I mean, a very
weird contract where you -- you’re subject to the whim
of the other party as to whether the contract continues
or not.
MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, I think in the --
with -- again, with the injunctive relief available, a
court could in the initial stages without the aid of
discovery determine whether -- what the parties'
obligations are during the course of the litigation.
Here the dealers continued to pay the exorbitant rents
that were being charged. So I would argue that the oil
company was at no point in time harmed by virtue of the
claim and then the proceedings that ensued.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't know. They --
you know, if they knew that they were pulling out and --
and were claiming a termination, they might have been
looking for somebody else to take over the franchise.
MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor, I think, as a
practical matter, that would not have happened during
the pendency of the litigation. So, again, to the
extent that the -- an injunction had been sought, it
would have helped to preserve the status quo, and in
this case, again, here, the oil company was not in any
way, shape, or form harmed by the dealers' pursuit of
their claim because they continued to pay their rent,
for those that remained in business, and those that went
out of business obviously stopped.
Your Honors, if I may turn to the other claim,
which is also present in this case here, the claim of
the non-renewal, both the government and Shell have
suggested that the statute imposes some sort of a
mandatory mechanism requiring the franchisor to give
notice and then the dealer seeking an injunction within
days in order -- in connection with the non-renewal
claim.
I think, as a practical matter, we need to
start with the proposition of what the jury found here,
and the jury found that, in this case, the oil company
added new terms to the lease specifically for the
purposes of converting the franchise-operated stations
to direct operations. They wanted the dealers out of
business, and they wanted to take over operations of
their stations.
Had the oil company issued a notice of
non-renewal when the parties didn't reach agreement on
the terms of the agreement and this case had proceeded
to a trial, there is no question, but that the result
would have been exactly the same as the result is here.
So the question we are facing is whether or
not this mechanism that they have advanced as being
the -- the only way, the exclusive remedy to proceed is,
in fact, such, and we would argue that, in fact, it is
not. Both the government and the Solicitor have
conceded already that, while the statute requires notice
in the normal course, that, certainly, notice can be
side-stepped, and that conduct can give rise to notice.
The next question then would be whether or not
the dealer must seek injunctive relief as a prerequisite
to maintaining a claim, and we argue that there is
nothing in the language of the statute suggesting that
the injunction is mandatory.
JUSTICE BREYER: The theory of it is to
protect the dealer, and the dealer here is faced with a
company that says, we are not going to renew your lease.
And they are unreasonable, and the dealers think. The
statute says: Fine, don't renew it, okay? And, here,
we’ll give you a really good deal, so you won't be hurt.
If you really think he's wrong, go sue for an
injunction. And, second, we are going to give you extra
bonus damages and attorneys' fees and all that stuff.
So we protected you a lot.
Now, why should there be a third thing that
the statute says nothing about, which nobody's ever
heard of? You just stay there, and you say: I'm going
to just do business every day, just like nothing
happened, and I write the words under protest.
I mean, why would Congress have gone to all
that trouble if that's all you have to do?
MR. FARRAHER: Well, certainly, Your Honor,
the language of the statute itself, while the -- while
Congress provides for injunctive relief, which would be
applicable equally to non-renewal claims as it would to
termination claims, and while the statute speaks to
notice, again, applicable to both, there is absolutely
nothing in the statutory language that says this is a
mandatory exhaustion of remedies.
You must seek an injunction --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, but there is a purpose,
and the purpose is that this system at least brings a
judge in to see if that dealer really does have enough
of a claim to get this relaxed injunction. But your
system leaves it 100 percent up to that dealer. It
could be heard of that dealer really doesn't have a good
claim, and all he does is write the words "under
protest."
MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: But you don't have a judge in
it, at that stage, under your interpretation.
MR. FARRAHER: We think that our case,
certainly, is distinguishable from the other two
circuits that have addressed the issue. In our case,
our dealers filed a lawsuit before they were presented
with the leases for signature. They told the oil
company that they were signing under protest, with a
reservation of all their rights.
It was the oil company that presented the
leases to them on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. They
said, there will be no negotiation of these terms, and
you must sign, and if you don't sign, we are going to
issue a notice of non-renewal. And then that pins the
continuation of the dealers' business on the hopes that,
even with a relaxed standard, a trial court is going to
issue an injunction.
And I certainly don't think that the statute
or the Congress intended for the dealers to risk their
businesses on the likelihood of getting the injunctive
relief --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I ask you,
have you accepted the majority's reasoning in the Dersch
case, the Seventh Circuit case, with respect to 2805(f)?
You haven't raised that argument in your brief, so
obviously, you have accepted their view that 2805(f)
doesn't apply to the right to preserve your claims of
improper --
MR. FARRAHER: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Are you
-- are you asking whether we accept the proposition that
the -- the waiver of rights --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Seventh Circuit said
there’s no implied right of action under 2805(f).
MR. FARRAHER: The Seventh Circuit, if I
understand the case correctly, Your Honor, says that
there’s no implied cause of action under 2805(f)
standing alone, that if a franchisor is insisting upon a
term that includes a waiver, as in connection with
non-renewal, then the Dersch decision in the Seventh
Circuit would say that that might be actionable under
02(b)(3) because they have introduced a term that is
not agreed upon and is designed for the purposes of
forcing the dealers out of business.
I don't know that we have taken an opinion,
whether or not there’s an independent or implied cause
of action standing alone under 2805(f).
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I would have thought
your strongest argument would have been that, if we have
a statutory right not to waive any of our Federal or
State rights, if there has been a non-renewal on
reasonable terms, there has been a breach of that
obligation under the statute, then you had a right to be
renewed under reasonable terms, and if they are giving
you unreasonable terms -- "unreasonable" being defined
within the statutory constraints -- they impose
conditions that were imposed in bad faith to drive you
out; those are the two conditions -- then you had a
right to sue for that, non-renewal, because you had a
right to renew on reasonable terms.
MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, I appreciate the --
the argument, and, certainly, I -- I think it is
supportive of the dealers' claims in this case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but why didn't you
make the argument in your briefs? That's why I was
asking you whether you agreed with the Seventh Circuit's
reasoning, and that's why you didn't raise it or -- what
am I missing, that's making that argument not --
MR. FARRAHER: I think it --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- one that you relied
upon?
MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, I can't answer, in
hindsight, why we didn't raise it in the brief, but I do
hear the position that you are advocating and think it
is supportive of the -- of the dealers' position here.
If there are no additional questions --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just getting back to
the constructive eviction, I took a quick look at the
Marini and Ireland case that you cite, and I think
the -- the Petitioner is correct. There, the tenant
left part of the premises, and it was a constructive
eviction as to that part. And it's a 1970 case.
I just don't think you have many cases to help
you in the constructive eviction area. It's kind of
like the Holmes -- Sherlock, not Oliver Wendell --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that says the dog doesn't
bark. I mean, there is this huge body of
landlord/tenant law, and you have just a few cases, and
one of them, at least, doesn't appear to support you.
MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, I -- I guess the --
the best response I have to that proposition is that we
are not dealing in a traditional landlord/tenant context
here. We are dealing under a statutory scheme that
Congress enacted to protect franchisees, and we need to
look within the meaning of the statute as to what
termination means.
I would also say that, in the landlord/tenant
context, while the, perhaps, outdated notion of a
constructive eviction would require the tenant to leave,
cases seem to suggest, in a more modern sense, that the
relationship between the landlord and the tenant is more
of a contractual relationship in nature and, as such,
allows for the traditional remedies available under
contract law, in turning -- including self-help and
rescission, et cetera.
If there are no further questions, thank you
very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Lamken, you have 5 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN
ON BEHALF OF SHELL OIL PRODUCTS
COMPANY, LLC, ET AL.
MR. LAMKEN: Thank you.
I believe the debate in this case comes down
to about three issues: The first is what is the
relevant background principle we think Congress was
looking to when it used the words “terminate,”
“non-renew,” and “cancel” in the statute. We think the
most analogous background principles they would have
been looking to were contract law and the State
franchise statutes that existed at the time Congress
acted. I --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Lamken, isn't it
true that the statute, as a whole, expressed Congress's
feeling that the common law rules were really not
sufficient because, under the common law, of course,
they could just non-renew because they wanted to take
over the franchise themselves. And under the statute,
that is not permissible. So there’s a major change
that's created by the statute, which suggests, to me,
that maybe they didn't want to adopt all the preexisting
common law.
MR. LAMKEN: Right. There was a deficiency in
the common law, but it was limited to one point, and
that was termination and non-renewal. It wasn't that
breaches of contract -- and as the government has
explained, a breach of contract here is a precondition
to a constructive termination claim -- were
insufficiently remedied by State law. That was not the
issue before Congress.
The issue before Congress was that there was a
contractual right to terminate at will or for trivial
reasons or to non-renew for no reason or bad reasons
even, and that is what Congress regulated, was
terminations and non-renewals, in that sense, not
breaches of contract that turned out to be really bad.
The second thing is that because there was a
comprehensive State remedy, there is particularly little
reason to read this statute, this narrow statute,
expansively, particularly given that this is an
expressly preemptive -- a potentially conflict
preemption statute, which could have the effect of
displacing State law.
When you're looking at a statute that’s
narrowly looking at termination or non-renewal, you
would not ordinarily expand those terms to include
really bad breaches of contract, because that has the
potential to displace State statutory and potentially
State common law under the preemption clause.
And, finally, the last piece that comes up is
the problem of evasion. The issue becomes sort of,
well, people can just get around this statute if there
is no constructive termination cause of action. And the
answer to that is: There is no problem with evasion,
because everything that’s covered by constructive
termination has to be a breach of contract. State law
has this comprehensively covered. Increasing the price
terms on an open price term? U.C.C. 2-305, under which
plaintiff's recovered here, has that covered. So the --
extending the Federal statute really adds very little.
And the second point is that even under the
PMPA today, constructive termination has been rejected
-- every -- except in the narrow area of assignments,
under the theory that an assignment followed by a breach
is somehow a constructive termination, a theory which I
don't think we or the government thinks makes any sense.
But that's where it exists. And yet there’s no record
outside the area of assignment of these grand evasions
by boosting up all the prices in violation of the
contract.
And the risk of expanding constructive
termination here is it projects Federal law into
deciding whether or not it's going to prohibit
particular price terms, particular conditions,
particular things dealing with the rent and the
premises, something that Congress stayed away from and
left to the States. What Congress regulated here were
the narrow issues of termination and non-renewal, not
the substantive content of the franchise relationship.
If there are no questions, we ask that the
judgment with respect to termination be reversed and the
judgment with respect to non-renewal be affirmed.
Thank you.
