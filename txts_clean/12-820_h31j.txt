CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 12-820, Lozano v. Alvarez.
Mr. Regan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAWN P. REGAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REGAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
I represent Manuel Jose Lozano, a father who
loves his daughter.  Respondent kidnapped that daughter
and concealed her from Mr. Lozano, first in the United
Kingdom, for nearly eight months; then in France, then
in the United States.
In Abbott, this Court recognized child
abduction to be one of the worst forms of child abuse
and that the Convention, therefore, aims to deter and
prevent child abduction from occurring in the first
instance.  Equitable tolling furthers that aim.  By
contrast, the rule adopted by the Second Circuit
provides a playbook for thwarting the Convention --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. -- Mr. Regan, you --
you want us to apply equitable tolling in a field,
family law, where the interest of the child is always of
paramount importance and running all through family law
is -- is that concern.  And changed circumstances figure
very large.
So decrees that might be final in another
area of law are not because, if circumstances change,
then the child custody may change.  So it seems to me
that this area is hugely unfit for equitable tolling
that would leave out consideration of the child's best
interests.
MR. REGAN:  Justice Ginsburg, we believe
that equitable tolling does provide, within the context
of the Convention, consideration -- the opportunity for
courts to consider the interests of the child.  And
that's most poignantly illustrated by some of the cases
in which it has been applied.
If I may provide an example, an example in
Respondent's brief, Mendez Lynch v. Mendez Lynch, on
page 31 of their brief, it's a case in which the Court
found equitable tolling is available, and it found
equitable tolling applied factually.  The Court,
however, considered the facts and circumstances of the
child's life, including those facts and circumstances
that relate to the extent to which the child is settled.
But it considered those facts and
circumstances within the rubric of the Article 13
analysis, and that is consistent with what other courts
have done in what I would -- what I would term more
natural Article 12 --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that equitable
discretion, or is that still equitable tolling?
Because, as I understand equitable tolling, if it
applies and, say, there's a 6-month suspension, the
child must go back, so that there's -- so that the --
that the weighing that you're talking about just
doesn't -- doesn't come into play.
MR. REGAN:  Thank you, Justice Kennedy.  And
I think this is important because I think this -- this
illustrates how foreign courts have miscomprehended
equitable tolling, how it would operate -- how it
operates within the context of the convention.
Equitable tolling would prevent the
abducting parent from taking advantage of the Article
12.2 exception, that -- that the child should not be
returned because the child is now -- because the parent
has met that minimal routine showing of the child is now
settled.  He's going to school, he or she is -- has some
friends, so on and so forth, that they are living a
normal life here.
What it does not prevent -- and Mendez
illustrates this, as do other cases -- it does not
prevent the Court from looking at the Article 13
considerations.  So, for example, as in Mendez and other
cases, the Court will still consider if the child -- if
the child is of sufficient age and maturity to testify,
such that, if this Court should take into account his or
her views or objections to return, the Court can do so.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where is Article 13, so
we can look at it?
MR. REGAN:  I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where is it in the
materials?
MR. REGAN:  Mendez v. Lynch?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Article 13, which you're
referring to.
MR. REGAN:  Oh, Article 13.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'd like to read it.
MR. REGAN:  I'm sorry.  Article 13 is -- it
is at -- I'm sorry.  It's at 135a of the Petition
Appendix.  Excuse me.  Article 13 is at 136a.  Excuse
me.  135a is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and it does
provide -- just while people are looking at it, it does
provide that, even though there's, in your view,
equitable tolling, there are still circumstances in
which the child would not go back, if there's a grave --
grave risk?
MR. REGAN:  Grave risk of harm.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Grave risk of harm to the
child.
MR. REGAN:  Or if the court finds that it
would be an intolerable situation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, again, as Justice
Ginsburg questions, it seems to me indicates, there are
two different axes here.  One is the best interest of
the child, and the other is an adequate deterrent so
that parents don't abduct.  But those axes don't cross
very often, if at all.
MR. REGAN:  I respect, Justice Kennedy, it's
difficult to balance them.  They're somewhat
incommensurate or -- you know, competing considerations
or -- but both very important.  We think that equitable
tolling properly balances them within the structure of
the Convention because equitable tolling, again, it --
it prevents this Article 12.2 exception, but it doesn't
prevent the Article 13 exception.
In fact, in many ways, what we're talking
about is not inconsistent with what the English court
does or did in Cannon.  In Cannon, the court said if --
where there is concealment and subterfuge, there will be
a heightened burden for establishing settlement.
Now, in this --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that still -- but
Article 13 still is different from what's in the best
interest of the child.
MR. REGAN:  I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, it's true that all
we're talking about is for the -- during the time in
which the hearing takes place, but these hearings take
years, and expert witnesses are not available or readily
available.
MR. REGAN:  Well, Justice Kennedy, to your
point about timing and essentially provisional return, I
do think -- you know, courts -- district courts have
shown great adeptness at dealing with those issues.
They've entered conditional orders that require the
child be returned at a time when the proceeding -- when
the testimony is necessary.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Excuse me.  Let me give you
this example.  Suppose a child is abducted at -- at age
one and is concealed for 10 years, and then the location
of the child is discovered.  The other parent files a
petition.  So that, if there's equitable tolling, the
petition was filed within one year.
But during those 10 years, the child has
become very well settled in the new country, has learned
the language of that country, the customs developed,
gone to school, developed relationships, and so forth.
Under -- if there is no equitable tolling,
but the abduction can be taken into account under the
doctrine of equitable discretion, that's -- that's one
thing.  But the way you read this, the way you read the
Convention, the equitable tolling would mean that the
petition was filed within a year, and unless one of the
conditions in Article 13 was met, for example, a grave
risk that the child's return would expose the child to
physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the
child in an intolerable situation, then there would
be -- then the child would have to be removed.
So there is that major difference, isn't
there, between those two positions?
MR. REGAN:  There is a significant
difference.  And we think that that significant
difference is warranted and necessary in order to
achieve the effect of deterrence because the Second
Circuit's rule essentially says to abducting parents, if
you abduct your child and you conceal your child for 12
months, you will be rewarded.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's true.  The
position of the Respondent and the government would give
a great incentive for parents to abduct children and
hide them for a period of time.  But on the other side,
as my example, I think, illustrates, your rule would
mean that a child who is very well settled in a
particular location would have to be returned to the
other country for purposes of the custody determination.
So why do you think the Convention should be
read one way, rather than the other?
MR. REGAN:  Justice Alito, I hope to make
abundantly clear that our position, equitable tolling,
would not mandate that that child be returned.  All it
does -- but it's significant --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how would it not?
MR. REGAN:  It -- it changes the question
that the court asks.  Absent equitable tolling, the
courts -- the question on which -- the question before
the court is, is this child settled?  And the factors
the courts looked at -- the courts have looked at it,
and it really -- they're -- you know, "settlement" is
not defined in the Convention, and Congress has left it
to courts to decide.
And courts look at --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, which of the
articles -- which of the provisions in Article 13
would -- would prevent the return in the hypothetical
that Justice Alito just gave you?
MR. REGAN:  Courts have looked at -- and
I'll say it -- in the decades --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, what -- what does
Article 13 allow the court to consider?  It says, "It's
not bound to order the return if the person,
institution, or other body having care of the person of
the child was not actually exercising the custody rights
at the time of removal or retention."
Well, you know --
MR. REGAN:  That's known as acquiescence.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That wouldn't have -- or
had consent to or -- that wouldn't apply in his
hypothetical or in this case.
MR. REGAN:  It's really B.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  B, "There is grave risk
that his or her return would expose the child to
physical or psychological harm."  I mean, we have no
reason to believe that -- that your client would --
would harm the child or -- or that the parent in Justice
Alito's hypothetical would harm the child, "or otherwise
place the child in an intolerable situation."
I don't see how any of those things would --
would come to the assistance of the child in -- in
Justice Alito's hypothetical.
MR. REGAN:  If I may explain by way of
illustration, in some of the cases, what courts have
looked at.  And let me give -- Blondin is another
example cited in our brief, cited by the Solicitor
General, a Second Circuit -- the well-known Second
Circuit case.  That's a natural Article 12.1 case.
Petition is filed before the period of one year expires.
The Second Circuit looked at -- or Judge
Chin -- then-Judge Chin in the district court, looked at
the child's facts and circumstances related to
settlement as part of that grave risk analysis.  There
was expert testimony, as there often is in these cases,
that the child was suffering from potential -- from
post-traumatic stress disorder.
Experts testified that return of the
child -- the child should not be returned because it
presented a grave risk of harm to the child.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Physical or psychological
harm.
MR. REGAN:  That's correct.  And there are
cases, Mendez v. Lynch and others.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It might be now and then,
but in the routine case that Justice Alito just gave
you, I don't see how there's any -- any reason at all
not to yank the child back from wherever he's been for 10
years.
MR. REGAN:  If I may answer in two ways, in
the example Justice Alito gave.  With a 10-year-old
child, it's -- it's very likely that the court would
hear from that child.  I think the more difficult
example is -- let's make that child 7 or 8.  But --
and -- and there's no evidence these cases have
occurred.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Which court?  Which court?
To use the --
MR. REGAN:  United States court.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but Article 13 does
not say the child -- the child can state -- well, let's
see.  "The child objects to being returned."  I guess
you could limit to that.  "May also refuse to order the
return of the child if it finds that the child objects
to being returned."
MR. REGAN:  That's been universally adopted
by the courts hearing testimony.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that's the one
exception, yes.
MR. REGAN:  But -- but the grave risk
exception, and courts have applied this, it really -- it
really just -- it -- it changes the question, like in
Cannon.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in a sense, what
you're saying is that it's not an automatic -- it's not
an automatic rule.  The more you argue that Section 13
is applicable, the more you're watering down the very
rigid rule that you want, in order to say that there has
to be deterrence.
MR. REGAN:  I understand that point.
However, there is a difference.  And so what we're
trying to balance here, and I think -- it's not we.
What the Convention balances -- what courts applying the
Convention have found is the proper balance, is not for
courts to say, well, let's try and figure out what the
best interests are.
In fact, the Convention couldn't be clearer,
and Congress couldn't have been clearer that that is not
where it -- that's where it least wanted courts wading
into those waters.
JUSTICE BREYER:  The Convention says, in the
preamble, that the parties -- that's countries -- are
firmly convinced that the interests of the children are
of paramount importance in matters relating to their
custody.  Okay?  Paramount importance.  So the provision
you're talking about, Article 13, says, well, would
returning the child lead to physical harm, psychological
harm, or otherwise put the child in an intolerable
position.  So they mean intolerable.
So I think this would be a pretty typical
case.  The husband says he was fine.  The wife says, no,
he kicked me in the stomach and did a lot of other
things.  The judge hearing the two sides says I can't
say the husband's right.
MR. REGAN:  Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So we don't know.  Now,
your idea is to send the child back to the husband
unless the child gets up there and chooses between
parents.  That's pretty tough on 8- or 9- or 10-year-old
children and -- very tough.  And you're going to keep --
the -- you're going to send it back to the father in
this situation, unless the mother can prove it's
intolerable, either because of physical -- I mean, my
goodness, a physical or psychological, you have all the doctors
saying he should stay in New York.  A typical problem
for a family court judge, really tough.
So you have the Convention, which says in
the preamble, look to the interests of the child.  You
have every other country saying, that's what it really
means; in other words, they're against you.  You have
the Department of State, in charge of the treaty, saying
that's what it really means and otherwise against you.
And so what do you have going for you?  That isn't your
fault that there isn't too much going for you, but
nonetheless, I'd like to know what it is.
MR. REGAN:  I think we have a lot going for
us.  You've asked -- I think you've hit, Justice Breyer,
on just about every issue that I could possibly want to
address today.  But -- and -- and let me say, I -- I
respect the position of the 8- or 9-year-old child, the
difficulty.  I was that child before a judge on the --
giving that sort of testimony, so I certainly appreciate
it.
But on this -- this question of best
interests, the Convention makes the decided choice if
courts -- the Convention defines how courts are to
determine that best interest.  It doesn't say courts
should determine what is in the best interest of the
child.  It says look at whether the child is settled
under Article 12 or, if that's not applicable, you may
look at Article 13.  Other than that, the presumption is
the best interest of the child is for return.
You mention that the State Department is
against us, which I'm happy to take the opportunity to
address here.  We don't believe that the State
Department's views should be accorded great weight in
this situation.  Their brief does not speak to the
diplomatic consequences of equitable tolling.  It
doesn't speak to -- it doesn't speak to the idea that
equitable tolling will somehow impair our ability to
recover children abducted from the United States.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, Mr. Regan, aside
from the position of the United States, which -- which
has changed, you made that point, the determination
that's being made at this stage is really one of venue.
It's where the main bout will be fought out.  And so we
don't want that to linger for a long time.  We want that
decision to be made with dispatch.
And as one of the amici brief informs us,
many of these what you call kidnappers happen to be
badly abused women and if you -- if they had to go under
Article 13, then they would have this full-blown, was he
really the abuser?  Doing it without equitable tolling,
that question is reserved for the main -- for the main
bout.
I suppose if we had a case where the judge
isn't certain was the father abuser or not, that judge
would feel an obligation to stretch out this venue
determination, to see if it's an Article 13 situation.
MR. REGAN:  I think, Justice Ginsburg, the
domestic violence situation, which I am entirely
sensitive to and appreciate, illustrates the difficulty
of these cases and -- and that courts can't really
figure out what's -- who's right or who did what in
these circumstances.  Most of -- usually all of the
evidence is overseas on that issue.
What the Convention -- the approach the
Convention decides on taking is that, first, there is no
self-help remedy certainly for concealment, that -- that
nothing excuses concealment of the child.  And, in fact,
to the extent you said there's a goal and a value of
shortening these proceedings, to the extent equitable
tolling disincentivizes concealment, it does that.
I mean, the opposite rule says, if you
conceal, i.e., you extend that period of time during
which there's no relationship, you'll be rewarded.
It's an enormous incentive.  And our point
is there is the proper safety valve.  The standard under
Article 12.2 is so pedestrian, it is essentially have
you failed to be -- aside from abducting your child,
since then, have you failed to be a normal parent?  Is
your child in school?  Does he or she go to ballet
class?  Do you take him or her to church?  Do they have
friends?  All those things were satisfied here.  Can you
be employed?  What's your legal -- what's your
immigration status?
Now, this case illustrates just how simple
and routine that is to achieve.  And here, she didn't
have a job.  She's not here legally.  I guess the
court found that she had the depth and quantity of
friendships that your typical pre-kindergartner has, and
that was enough for her to defeat return.
The Convention properly balances these
things by saying where it presents -- and courts have
done this.  The district courts are doing this.  No one
says -- you know, the State, the Solicitor General and
our Respondent -- points to a single case where they
say, here's equitable tolling and boy -- you know, the
court got it wrong.
Here was the wrong outcome because they
applied equitable tolling as they have been doing for
nearly two decades.  Courts can do this.  But the
question, as it is in Cannon, can't be as simple as
well, are you -- are you doing fine here in the United
States.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Regan, Justice Breyer
pointed out that all other countries seem to disagree
with you.  That's obviously a concern of ours when we
interpret a treaty, that all other countries interpret
it in a -- in a single way.  Do you contest that?  Are
there any other countries that apply equitable tolling
rules?
MR. REGAN:  We believe that it's neither
surprising nor momentous that foreign courts have failed
to adopt equitable tolling.  It's not surprising because
they lacked the presumption that we do.  It's not
significant for two reasons.  One, we think -- as I've
alluded to, I think they miscomprehend equitable
tolling.  The Cannon court calls it "too crude," that it
won't allow for an accounting of the child's interest.
And as -- as the courts in the United States have been
clear, it does.
It provides --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they may be wrong.  Who
cares if they're wrong?  The point is a treaty should be
interpreted uniformly by all the parties to it.  And
you're telling me, well, all the rest of them interpret
it another way, but they're wrong -- you know, everybody
is out of step, but me.  That's -- that's just not
right.
MR. REGAN:  Not at all, Justice Scalia.  And
it was actually -- your question relates to my third
point.
What those decisions reflect is that the
Convention leaves room within Article 12 for the
operation of domestic law.  Article 12 speaks to
commencement of proceedings.  You must commence
proceedings within one year.  It speaks to settlement.
The Convention -- it is Congress in ICARA that defines
how one commences proceedings.  It says you must file in
a court that has jurisdiction.  That's Section 11603(b)
and (f)(3), which are at 117 through 121a of the
Petition Appendix.
Congress decides that's how you -- how you
stop that period, by filing in a court having
jurisdiction.  Other countries provide nation -- courts
of nationwide jurisdiction.  Some countries provide that
the central authority itself will file the petition for
the applicant or will file in its own interest on behalf
of the child.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  None of that is covered by
the treaty.  Yes, each State may apply its own law with
respect to matters not covered by the treaty, but I do
not read that to say -- to mean that each State may apply its
own law in interpreting the provisions of the treaty and
so can create exceptions on the basis of equitable
discretion when the treaty has none or because its
courts use that in another -- in other contexts or
create an exception on the basis of equitable tolling.
This is a matter of interpreting the treaty,
not of bringing into effect some other principle of --
of State law that overrides the treaty.  That's how I
read that provision.
MR. REGAN:  Our position is that, if you
look at the drafting history here, the drafting history
was preliminary draft Article 11 provided for two
periods, automatic return, if you will, return subject
to the Article 13 and 20 defenses, if you filed within 6
months; or for a period -- a discovery rule capped at
one year, if you didn't know the whereabouts of the
child.
Some countries said those periods are too
short.  Some said they're too long.  Some said we don't
want to have to deal with this discovery rule issue, we’re
concerned about the evidentiary burdens.  What's
important is what the drafters did.
They extended that first period to a year,
and then, with respect to this discovery rule concept,
they said, we're going to give you Article 18, it
provides for return at any time; we're going to provide
Article 34, which the explanatory report highlights, is
meant to provide for invocation of domestic law or
rules, particularly where 12.2 is implicated.  And it
left for countries to define the -- to define key
elements of Article 12.2.
In doing --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  That's
turning legislative history, in my mind, on its head.
They considered directly, if you study the
SG's brief, a discovery rule that would have codified
equitable tolling.  And there was lengthy discussion
about it and a decision that they wouldn't do that,
that, instead, they would expand the period to a year
where automatic return was required, and they introduced
the best interest of the child after that year, and that
that was now a balancing of all interests, the parents'
and the child's.
And you're right, they had other provisions
that would affect the possible return or lack thereof,
and they never wanted to stop a court from returning a
child if it in its equitable discretion decided it was
appropriate.  But you're turning that legislative
history on its head a little bit.
MR. REGAN:  Justice Sotomayor, we believe
that the State Department's reading of that history --
of that drafting history, is oversimplified because
there were objections to that period, to that -- to that
discovery rule that weren't simply to a discovery rule
as a general matter.  It was that some countries said,
we don't want to have to deal with that.  Other
countries said, it needs to be longer.
And so the choice that was made was a choice
to give countries flexibility to determine how they want
to calculate that period, when it should be set, and
potentially to employ equitable tolling.  The
jurisdiction convention --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Don't use up your time.
MR. REGAN:  The jurisdiction convention is
consistent with that idea.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MR. REGAN:  I'd like to reserve my time.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Moskowitz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAUREN A. MOSKOWITZ
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the court:
To reverse the Second Circuit's holding and
to apply equitable tolling to Article 12 would be
squarely at odds with the Convention's text, purpose,
and drafting history, as well as contrary to the
post-ratification understanding and interpretation of
every other signatory state to consider the issue.
Your Honors, we ended on a note of drafting
history, and to return to Justice Sotomayor's question
about turning that a bit on its head, I agree.  The
drafting history specifically shows that the countries
considered two periods, one of prompt return, return
forthwith within 6 months of the removal; and 6 months
from the discovery of the whereabouts of the child, if
the child were not known.
And what the drafters thought -- some
thought the period needed to be longer, but there were
countries that wanted it to be shorter.  There were
countries that were very concerned that the child would
become settled in the new environment, such that
uprooting that child again, just for purposes of having
a custody determination in the -- in the former country
of habitual residence would be contrary to that child's
interest.
So they struck a balance.  They -- they
negotiated over -- over several drafts and finally
arrived at a single period of one year, but that wasn't
going to be a cutoff.  Instead of having a statute of
limitation -- statute of reposed construct, they said
the obligation is going to continue, and it's going to
continue until the child turns 16, unless it is
demonstrated that the child is now settled in her -- in
its new environment.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But what -- what troubles me
about your position is that it undermines the best
interests of children in a very powerful way, insofar as
it does not deter and, indeed, encourages -- provides a
great incentive for parents to abduct their children.
And that was the central purpose of the Convention, to
prevent harm to children and also to parents, but
centrally to children who are abducted.
And if you have a rule that says if you can
abduct the child and you can hide for a year, which
isn't very difficult, then all you have to do is provide
some evidence of settlement, and you are going to -- you
are going to win, you are going to deter return.
Am I wrong to be concerned about that?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, your concern is
not wrong, but I think it's not founded on what -- what
will happen here.  I don't think it encourages abduction
and concealment because that -- those facts of
concealment are going to be taken into account into
whether the child, in fact, is settled.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, all right.  Perhaps
that's the solution to the problem then.  I wonder if
you would accept that, that there is no equitable
tolling, let's assume for the sake of argument, but
abduction is a strong factor that weighs against the
return, that weighs against the failure to return the
child, not just something that can be disposed of in a
sentence, which is basically what the district court did
here, but a very strong factor that has to be taken into
account in the exercise of equitable discretion.
Would you disagree with that?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  A bit, Your Honor, and
it's -- the abduction itself is the -- what triggers the
Convention to begin with.  Every single case that is
heard under the Convention involves a wrongful removal
or retention.  There will be illegal abduction every
time.  And the drafters in fact absolutely were trying
to address that harm to children.
And they -- the paramount interest of the
children were designing this Convention, and they did
state that there were two --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think they had it in
mind, not just the interest of children, but the
interest of parents.  It's simply not true that, in all
cases involving children, the paramount interest of the
child governs.  That's not the case, or else, we would
remove many children from their parents in this country.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
MS. MOSKOWITZ:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
Absolutely, Your Honor.
Parents have rights.
Absolutely.
And that is one of the
things that this treaty considers.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, it does not
consider, ultimately, the custody determination and with
which parent the child should live.  That is expressly
not part of the Convention, and that is what --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the --
whether or not the child is settled in a particular case
is certainly going to be a significant consideration in
the custody determination, isn't it?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, Your Honor, I would
presume so.  But as well as any wrongful acts of either
or both parents would be taken into account in a
full-blown merits best interest of the child custody
determination.  What the Convention is trying to address
in the instances of where a child is now settled in a
new environment after having been at least one year in
the new environment is, should the child be uprooted in
anticipation of that full-blown hearing.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the fairness --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The problem is
you're each -- you're each using the child as the tool
in the objective that you have in representing the
parents.  On the one side is the allegation of
inequitable conduct in concealment.  On the other side
is the interest in settlement.  That's a dispute between the
two parents, and the child is being used as -- as -- I
don't know what -- you know, a tool in implementing
those conflicting considerations.
And to the extent that the Convention was
designed to deter that kind of kidnapping, it adopted
a -- a fairly strict rule.  And you're each trying to
say, oh, the rule doesn't mean what it means because,
don't worry, we'll take those considerations into
account in addressing custody; and on the other side,
well, don't worry because there's not that much
difference between 12 and 13.
So how are we supposed to decide between
those two conflicting considerations of the parents
while maintaining the paramount concern, certainly not
the exclusive one, but the significant one, in the
interest of the child.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  And just
to address the one point that the Petitioner raised of the,
don't worry about Article 12 because there's Article 13,
those are completely different constructs.  In fact,
Congress recognized that, when it set a different burden
of proof for defenses under Article 13, as opposed to
the well settled -- settled analysis under Article 12.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that cuts
against you in some respects.  You say there is such a
big difference, and therefore, it is very important that
the kidnapping parent do the best he or she can to
conceal the child's presence, so they get beyond 13 and
into 12.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  No, Your Honor, because if
the parent is concealing the child -- for example, if
the parent is moving from place to place to evade
detection or changing the child's name or not enrolling
the child in school to avoid detection --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My gosh, all it takes is
moving to Peoria.  I mean, I don't mean to denigrate
Peoria, but all it takes is moving to a place that has
no connection to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Justice Sotomayor is from
New York.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes, obviously.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Obviously.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Those are us from
the Midwest think it's actually easier to hide a child
in New York.
(Laughter.)
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I do have a point -- a
question though.  What sense does this make when -- that
a child who -- a suit is filed within the year, but the
litigation takes two or the child who -- the filing is a
day after the year, and the litigation takes a year and
they're both in the same situation.  Why should those
two children be treated differently?  Why should one
have the benefit of settled now and the other not have
it?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What sense does it make
when, as Justice Alito indicated, part of the central
purposes of the Convention is to avoid the kidnapping of
children?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, absolutely, that
is one of the objectives of the Convention, and it
exists because that was presumed to be contrary to the
interest of children, and I don't dispute that in the
majority of the cases, that's true.
But the concept that the drafters had to
grapple with this issue -- they wanted to deter child
abductions, absolutely, but they also recognized that,
at some point in time, it wasn't going to be just about
children at large.
It was going to be about --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't Article 13
enough protection?  It has to do with -- and unlike
Justice Scalia, I don't think it's psychological or
physical harm necessarily by the parent, but by the
situation.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The return.  You agree
with that?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  I do think
it -- it should be broader than that.  I think there are
courts that -- the Article 13 defense is supposed to be
narrow, just like the Article 12.2 settled exception,
but the settled exception isn't enough -- excuse me,
Article 13 isn't enough because the drafters wanted
Article 12, too.
They wanted to be able to take into account
the situation of the child after this one year.  And why
one year and not one year including the hearing, I think
it was a balance.  The drafters were concerned both that
it was going to be too long and that it was going to be
too short.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Moskowitz, going back to
Justice Alito's question.  Could you tell me how you
think this works?  You said, in response to Justice
Alito, that sometimes concealment can be a factor in
determining whether a child is settled.  And I presume
you mean if somebody conceals the child by moving the
child from place to place, the child would not be
settled.
Is it also a factor in determining whether a
settled child should nonetheless be returned?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, I -- I -- that's
the question of whether and to what extent there is
discretion to return a child -- a settled child under
Article 12.  And I think --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Or under Article 18.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, Article 18 -- my
understanding of Article 18 and the government's
interpretation of Article 18 is that Article 18 was
designed, not as a duty or something arising under the
Convention, but a recognition that the Convention is not
an exclusive statement and not intended to occupy the
space on child abduction and return.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think your answer to
Justice Kagan's question has to be no, or else I don't
understand what we're doing here.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, I struggle with
this because I think that there is a reading of the
plain language that says no, but it's -- there is a
general feeling that there should be some sort of escape
hatch --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what is the answer?
I'd like a straight answer in your opinion because
Justice Kagan's case, the mother kidnaps the child.
They live in a grain elevator -- a nicely refurbished
grain elevator, in Peoria for a year.  And after the
year, a month later.  The father finds both of them,
goes to a family judge -- a very tough job by the way --
and the family judge reads this, and he says, well, I
have to admit the child is settled here now in Iowa.
All right.  It's settled.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But send the child back to
London, he's going to be just about as settled.  I mean,
really, it's not that much difference, but I can't say
the child is not settled.
The father says this is the most unfair
thing I've ever seen.  She hides out for a year.  The
child would be just as well back in London.  Almost as
well.  Who knows?  Maybe better.  But now, what can the
family court do -- judge do?  That's the straight
question we've been trying to get your answer to that,
and it isn't an answer to say -- you could say, if
that's the answer, I don't know.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, in -- in that
question, there's -- there's the question of what can
they do under the Convention and what can they do.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, what can they do?  I
just want to know if the family court judge will say
please settle this, and the two of them won't.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And so, now, what can the
judge do?  Is the father simply out of luck or not?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  No, Your Honor, because a
full-blown merits, best-interest-of-the-child analysis
under the -- the custody-type family court proceeding
that is envisioned to follow a return petition under the
Convention will take all of those facts into account.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but prior to that.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Prior to.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  If you could go back to --
do you agree with Justice Scalia, that, really, at that
point, there's nothing to do?  Once the determination
has been made that the child is settled, there is no
remaining discretion that the judge has?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, I think there is
some discretion under Article 12 to return the settled
child, but it cannot be under a set of facts that were
completely within the minds of the drafters when they
chose the one-year period.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you say -- I don't
understand what you're saying.  Give us an example.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, it's hard to
come up with a specific example, but there can't -- it
can't be --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You just don't want to say
no.  It seems to me your case requires you to say no,
and it's no help to me to say, well -- you know, there
may be some exceptions that I can't describe.  Tell me
the exceptions if there are any.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, the -- the
exception to whether a child that is found to be settled
after all the facts --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  -- of concealment are taken
to -- into account, there -- there should remain some
discretion --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Under 13, right?  Is that
the discretion you're talking about?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  No, Your Honor.  It's the
discretion under Article 12, but it's in the same vein
of there is discretion under Article 13 and 20, as well.
The way that the language is written in Article 13, for
example, states that the State is not bound -- I'm on
136a of the Petition Appendix -- that the State is not
bound to order the return if it is established.
So it -- it's not saying that the return
must be denied if these defenses are established.
There's slightly different language in Article 12, which
I think is a reflection of the different drafting --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you -- you're
confusing me.  Let's say I'm the judge who has to decide
this.  The one-year period has just past, and I have
evidence that this child who is now two years old has
some friends, goes to play with the friends, goes to the
park, has become accustomed to some American customs,
knows the neighborhood.
So the child is settled to that degree.  And
you say even if there's been very elaborate -- a very
elaborate effort of concealment, no proffered
justification for the abduction, no indication that
there would be any serious harm if the child were sent
back to the U.K., you say that's just too bad.  That's
your answer?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  No, Your Honor.  I think
some of the factors you pointed out, for example, that
there would be no serious harm if the child were
returned, not necessarily physical harm or intolerable
situation under Article 13, but there -- Article 12
settlement does take into account roots.  It's not
routine, it's not --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But can you give me any
authority?  I read that exactly in Article 12, but
you've now given me a different impression.  What
Article 12 says is that, if it's less than a year, the
child is returned forthwith.  If it's more than a year,
the child shall be returned forthwith, unless -- unless
it is demonstrated the child is now settled in its new
environment.
It doesn't say you don't return it if the
child is now well settled in the environment.  It just
says you don't have to return it forthwith.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So I would have thought
that that would have opened room for discretionary
factors, but you have not given me a case that said that
that's so.  You have not given me anybody who said that
what I thought was the natural reading and which you'd
like to be the natural reading, you've not given any
support for the proposition that it is the natural
reading.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I -- I assumed from
your brief that that was not the reading you were giving
it.  And that is not the reading it has to be given,
frankly.  I read it the other way, "shall order the
return unless it is demonstrated that the child is now
settled."
I assume that to mean in which case you
shall not order the return.  Isn't that the way you've
been reading it?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  No, Your Honor.  We do in
our --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, it is not.  Okay.
Well, then, gee, we don't have a lot to argue about here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, if that's the case, if
you're reading it that way -- I mean, I was reading it
Justice Scalia's way, too.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  The first clause says,
"shall" and the second clause says, "shall not."  But
there is an alternate reading where the first clause
says, "shall," and the second clause essentially says,
"may or may not at your discretion."  But, boy, that
would open up a big discretionary hole if you read it
that way, wouldn't it?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  No, Your Honor.  It
shouldn't be read that broadly.  It's certainly -- and
the House of Lords in England, in In re:  M, did find
that there was a residual discretion after finding a
child was settled.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So I should read that case
because the language says, "Unless it is demonstrated
the child is now settled, you return it forthwith,
unless it is demonstrated the child is well settled."
Well, now, it's demonstrated well settled.  Does that
mean I cannot return it?  Or does it mean I don't have
to return it?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And I say -- or you say I
read that case in the House of Lords, and I will
discover it means you don't have to return it.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  That's the way the House of
Lords interpreted it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And they relied on
Article 18, didn't they?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  No, Your Honor.  They found
the discretion within Article 12.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Moskowitz, what do you
do about Article 13 in that case, which begins,
"notwithstanding the provisions of" Article -- "of the
preceding Article 12, the judicial or administrative
authority requesting is not bound to order the return of
the child if the person" -- blah, blah, blah.
That says to me that, under 12, you are
bound, and you're telling me, well, you're really not
bound under 12.  You have discretion anyway.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I, frankly, didn't
understand that that was your argument in this case, and
it -- it puts the whole case in a quite different light.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Article 12, you are
absolutely bound to return the child, unless you meet
one of these exceptions within the one year, forthwith
return.  Prompt -- prompt return is the idea of the
first clause of Article 12.  Article --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the one year.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Correct.  And under Article
12.2, that's saying the child -- the court shall --
shall also order the return after this 1-year period,
unless it is demonstrated.  And the question is what
happens if it's demonstrated, and that's do you have to
return still, or can you -- or do you have to keep the
child here?  And I think what the -- generally, the
courts have found -- and it's not unanimous
internationally; it's not.
Hong Kong says --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In many cases, this would
be an example.  The cost of experts to testify about the
child's adoption or adaption or settlement in New York
would be very substantial.  The experts who had examined
the child, the experts who knew about the school, the
school's officials themselves, would all have to go to
England to testify.  Is that a factor that the courts
consider, or is that not -- not relevant?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, I think those
facts are exactly why the settled exception exists.  It
recognizes that the -- the reason to get the child
immediately back under the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In other words,
"settlement" is a code word for saying ease of producing
witnesses?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  No, Your Honor, it's not,
but it certainly is a recognition that the -- the
justification for return and prompt return is in part to
return to the status quo ante of where child was for
purposes of having a custody determination.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I -- may I ask you, I
think your brief -- I may not be remembering it
correctly, but I think you -- you said no equitable
tolling, and everybody in all the other countries agree
on that, but there is equitable discretion.  I think
that you -- and the question is, is there this equitable
discretion notion?
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Briefly, please.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you.
They're -- the courts are divided
internationally on whether equitable discretion exists
to return a child that has been determined to be
settled.  But I think, on balance, there should be some
level of equitable discretion to return a settled child,
but not under -- simply because of facts of concealment
that were firmly within the minds of the drafters when
drafting Article 12.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MS. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. O'Connell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MS. O'CONNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the government's
position on -- on this question we've just been
discussing, whether Article 12 is absolute or whether
there is discretion even within Article 12, even though
specific elements of discretion are contained in Article
13?
MS. O'CONNELL:  It's our position that,
under Article 12, there is discretion to return a
settled child and that that comes from Article 12
itself.  As you pointed out, the language of Article 12
says that, if more than a year has passed, the court
shall order the return of the child, unless the child is
settled in her new environment.
And that -- I mean, I think it's clear that
that could be read in two ways, and the Court has said
that, when the "similar except shall" formulation -- and
we cited in our brief the Department of Commerce v. U.S.
House of Representatives case.  The "similar except
shall" language, it's interpreted depending on the
context in which it appears.
And we think it's very clear from the
Convention that in the context of the Convention and
specifically Article 12, that the better reading is that
a settled child may be returned.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why doesn't the context
include Section 13, which -- which lists specific
reasons why you can depart from 12?  I mean, it seems
very strange to say, and in addition to that, there's a
whole pot load of other reasons within -- within 12
itself.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, Article -- it's true
that Articles 13 and 20 are written in expressly
discretionary language, but those are sort of set out as
exceptions to the rule of Article 12.  Article 12 is
written up differently, but there's nothing in the
Convention that ever says that a child has to stay in
the country where she has been abducted to.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's -- what's the -- an
example of where a settled child might be returned?  A
very -- two very good parents, and the child is very
adaptable, and so the child can -- is well settled now,
but the child will be well settled in the new
environment at well.  Is that the -- is that the
hypothetical?
MS. O'CONNELL:  In exercising the discretion
the court should be -- it's not just a free --
free-wheeling discretion that the court is exercising
under Article 12.  We think it's guided by the purposes
stated in the Convention.  So, yes, first, you look at
whether the child is settled, and that could be enough
to defeat the presumption that an abducted child should
be returned.
You can also look at whether the child could
easily resettle if the child was sent back.  For
example, a 10-year-old child who was in school and had a
lot of friends and a routine in London was abducted to
the United States for a year.  That child may not -- may
be settled in the United States, but she may not have a
difficult time resettling.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You would expect all the
signatories to this treaty to come up with essentially
the same exceptions, under -- under what you say is --
is the interpretation of Article 12?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, it seems to me it
just makes that article impossible to apply consistently
country to country.
MS. O'CONNELL:  No, I don't think so.
And -- and, the other signatories have -- have almost
all, I mean, I think the Hong Kong court does say that
it doesn't have discretion, but it said, in that case,
nevertheless, it would, even if it had discretion, it
wouldn't order the children returned.  But the other
courts of signatory countries that have interpreted
Article 12 have all found a discretion, whether it be in
Article 12 or in Article 8.
And if I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Have they exercised it --
have they exercised it, that discretion which they say
is there?
MS. O'CONNELL:  I mean --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Have they exercised that
discretion not to apply the -- the mandatory requirement
of Article 12?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes.  I mean, courts in the
United States have done that.  I think courts in -- in
other countries --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm talking about foreign
courts.
MS. O'CONNELL:  -- have as well.  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  If I understand the way you
think this works, you don't -- there's not even a
presumption that a settled child will stay, right?
You're just saying, once you've found a settled child,
the obligation to return the child goes away, but at
that point, it really is a kind of "all things
considered" inquiry, with no presumption operating at
all, just in light of the purposes of the treaty?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, I think the -- the
last part, Justice Kagan, is the most important part,
that it has to be guided by the objectives of the
treaty; that it's not a free-wheeling, best interests of
the child analysis or where this child should be, but
you could take into account the principle in Article 12,
that it's harmful to uproot a settled child, but you can
also weigh against that the idea that this Convention is
really geared in the first place toward preventing
abduction.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would think it
would be very unusual for a family court in that
situation not to go ahead with the custody proceeding
before it because it would think the child is settled.
Now, do I send the child back.  So that they can do the
custody proceeding in England, or just go ahead and do
it here?  Don't you think most family court judges would
say, let's just go ahead and do it here?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, if there's -- if
there's reason to send the child back, even -- even a
settled child, we think that the purposes of the
Convention should -- should prevail there.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What kind of
reasons -- what kind of reasons would there -- would
there be?
MS. O'CONNELL:  That the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  To send the child
back?
MS. O'CONNELL:  That the parent engaged in
behavior like concealing the child that is -- that is
not condoned under the Convention, that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you would visit
on the child the behavior of the parent?
MS. O'CONNELL:  We think the court -- I
mean, the court has discretion, we think, to order a
child's returned even if she's settled.  I mean, that --
that discretion could be abused if a child has been in
the United States, for example, for 5 years, and the
court says, well, the child was being concealed, so we
will send the child back.
But -- but we think -- and there will be
some cases in which the court could probably not abuse
its discretion by deciding the case either way.
But, yes, we think on the one hand equitable
tolling is not a good way to deal with this problem
because Article 12 specifically wants courts to take
into consideration the interest of the child --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, whatever fears
my colleagues have, I've only found two -- or I should
say my clerks have only found two published decisions in
which courts have returned the child, so it's not as if
they are ignoring the settlement issue.  In fact, some
might say that they are not giving abduction enough
weight in -- in enough cases.
But I -- the Hong Kong court who said there
might not be discretion to return a settled child was
not the highest court of Hong Kong, either.
MS. O'CONNELL:  That's -- that's right.  I
don't think any of these decisions are from the highest
court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so, if we're going
to give uniform meaning, the uniform meaning of
international weight is that abduction is one factor for
a court to consider in its equitable weighing on
settlement because that's the whole purpose of the
Convention.  That's a central reason in the preamble.
MS. O'CONNELL:  That's right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But isn't there --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There's always -- isn't
there always abduction?  As your friend has pointed out,
the whole treaty only applies where the child has been
abducted, so you say, oh, well, there's a special
exception to the rules of the treaty where the child has
been abducted, but that's what the treaty applies to.
MS. O'CONNELL:  We understand that an
abduction is going to take place in every case.  I think
we are looking for something more than what happened in
this case, some sort of concealment that happened, so
that the parent that is left behind and looking for the
child cannot find him.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't know what sense -- I
don't know what sense that makes.  Let's say a child is
abducted in Mexico, and let's say that the parent who is
left behind is not a rich or sophisticated person, and
now, the child is brought to the United States.
And the parent in Mexico has a year to find
the child in the United States, doesn't speak English,
can't easily find a lawyer to handle the case.  He's got
an enormous country to try to find the child in the
United States.  How in the world is that going to be
done?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You don't need to do very
much concealment.  You can go to Peoria.  You can go to
New York City, and -- and it's going to be an enormous
struggle to find that child within a year.
MS. O'CONNELL:  The first thing I'll point
out is that Article 12 -- the drafters assumed that
there was going to be some difficulty in locating
children, and they decided on this one-year period, but
also point out the State Department dedicates
significant resources to finding children that are
thought to have been abducted to the United States.
They have access to all sorts of federal law
enforcement databases to try to determine if the child
has come here.  They have --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How -- how would that aid
be invoked?  Take Justice Scalia's example.  The parent
left behind in Mexico, no resources of her own or his
own.  How would the State Department get into the act?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Typically, the left-behind
parent will approach the central authority in his or her
own country and typically with an idea of what the
abducting parent's connections are to other countries.
And so, if the United States is singled out as a country
to which the child might have been taken, the Mexican
central authority would contact the United States
central authority, and immediately, somebody would be
assigned to start looking for that child within the
United States.
And there are a great number of resources
that are channeled toward that through the State
Department in working with other Federal agencies,
the -- the crime databases, the Federal parent locater
service that's used to track down people in the United
States to pay child support.
It works with State law enforcement agencies
who can check school records and driver's license
records and things like that, so it's not like it's -- I
mean, it is difficult.  We are acknowledging that it's
quite difficult.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How -- how separate are
the two concepts of the best interest of the child and
the interest in policing parents, so they don't abduct?
At what point do they intersect?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, I mean, we think --
the Convention starts with the presumption that a
settled child should be returned, and so the starting
presumption is always that you should not abduct the
child --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The child settled, that's
when the abduction took place.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Excuse me?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You said it started that a
settled child should be returned?
MS. O'CONNELL:  That -- that an abducted
child should be returned.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, abducted.
MS. O'CONNELL:  When the -- a determination
that the child is settled can overcome that presumption,
and then the other equitable factors, like concealment,
come into play.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Scalia?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You know, I have one more
question.  At the end of the day, now that I understand
the government's position, I don't see any difference
between your position and -- and the position of -- of
the Petitioner here, except that he wants to call it
equitable tolling, and you want to say we can take
concealment into account under Section 12 --
MS. O'CONNELL:  No --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and not apply the
absolute rule, where there's been concealment.  I don't
care whether you call it equitable tolling or not.
MS. O'CONNELL:  I think the positions are
quite different because, under an equitable tolling
analysis, putting aside that you may be able to satisfy
a different Convention defense, like one under Article
13 or 20, under an equitable tolling analysis, the court
would be prohibited from taking into account whether the
child is settled in her new environment in determining
whether to send her back.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Regan, five minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHAWN P. REGAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REGAN:  I would agree --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That is, in fact, the
central difference, isn't it?
MR. REGAN:  I would agree with Ms.
O'Connell, that there is a difference.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  A huge one, whether the
court can --
MR. REGAN:  The difference is not that a
court cannot take the facts and circumstances of the
child's life into account.  It can.  That is -- that is
the Mendez case.  That's Reyes Olguin.  That's Blondin.
There are innumerable cases that show that.  They can --
the Court can take that into account.  It's just a
question of what is the question to which the Court
applies those facts.
Under our circumstance, it's not this
Article 12.2, is the child doing fine here?  Is the
child living a normal life?  It's a different question.
Is the -- is the goal and motive and presumption for
return going to be defeated here because it would
present a risk of harm to the child?  We think that's
the right question because that's the only question that
deters concealment.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you -- can I ask you
how it works here?  I realize I don't know.  A year has
passed.  The father never found out where the child was.
Now, he suddenly finds out.  He runs to Iowa.  The judge
looks at this Convention, and he says, well, the year's
passed.  You've lost, let's say, and I don't have to --
I don't have to return him forthwith.  The child's not
going to suffer intolerable injury.  I can't use that.
I don't have to return him forthwith.
Now, I look, is he settled?  Yes.  He's
settled.  All right.  End of the matter.  But do we now,
in the discretion of the father, have a custody hearing?
The father can say, yes, all that's true, but I should
have custody.  And he goes, and under Iowa law, we see
who is entitled to custody.  And he has something going
for him.  Namely, the mother's acted pretty badly,
unless she has excusing circumstances in abducting the
child.
Does that happen or not?
MR. REGAN:  Well, the custody proceeding
would occur in a different court.  Of course, it
wouldn't occur in the Federal --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it would go to the
family court, so is that -- would that happen?  Could
that happen?  Of course, I think.
MR. REGAN:  Of course.  Of course.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  If the answer is of
course, what we're talking about here is, on the one
hand, we don't want to encourage abductions.  On the
other hand, we don't want to treat the child as a yo-yo.
MR. REGAN:  Absolutely.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So the question is whether
the custody hearing will be in a family court in Britain
or whether it'll be in a family court in the United
States.
MR. REGAN:  That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the correct
question; is that right?
MR. REGAN:  That is the question.  And also,
the question is how do we deter --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So our issue about whether
there's discretion or -- it's a little bit secondary
because we can have a big, full-blown hearing about who
should have custody, though, it will be in a different
court.  It's true.  You lose.  There is more incentive
to kidnap the child.
It's also true, if you win, there is a much
greater likelihood that the custody hearing will be in
Britain, rather than the United States, which is the
yo-yo problem.
MR. REGAN:  And our concern here, Justice
Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, go -- now,
say what you want to say.  Now, if I understand it
correctly.
MR. REGAN:  Our concern is the deterrence
and prevention, which is the goal of the Convention.
Justice Scalia asked about other nations in uniformity.
And there could be no better reflection about the room
created in Article 12 and that this -- that the
uniformity is not -- or that this is not a problem where
we need to be so concerned about uniformity.
In 2006, through the special commission
process, the meeting of the -- of the members of the
Convention, the United States specifically apprised the
other nations that it was employing equitable tolling in
the 12.2 context.  As the government concedes, no one
else disagreed.  No one expressed any concern about the
United States doing that.  That's a clear reflection
that there is this room in Article 12.
Government's and Respondent's position is
that concealment may be taken into account.  The problem
there is the Respondent still has this enormous
incentive to conceal, which is the purpose -- that's the
primary goal, to prevent that from happening, concealing and
abduction.  That's the goal of the Convention.
But also, there's no standard.  They haven't
articulated a standard.  The government doesn't
articulate one.  It -- it amounts to a standard that
says concealment matters, unless it doesn't.  That's an
enormous -- that ephemeral standard is very difficult
for a respondent to overcome.  It's very difficult for a
district court to apply.  And what it does is it creates
this incentive to conceal because no one even knows what
the question is.
Equitable tolling defines the question
within the context of the Convention.  It says, by
tolling, this is the question you should answer.  If
there's not to be tolling and there are lots of
courts -- lots of cases where courts have found we
shouldn't toll because the child wasn't concealed or the
parent didn't exercise due diligence finding the child,
then we'll ask the Article 12.2 question, whether the
child is settled.
The bottom line is equitable discretion will
result in the abduction of more children.  Equitable
tolling will disincentivize that.  I would urge the
Court to look at those cases I mentioned, Mendez,
Blondin.
Reyes Olguin is another one.  2005, Westlaw
67094, a 2005 case in the Eastern District of New York,
Judge Gleeson where return was denied under these
circumstances.  Now, that's a natural 12.1 case, I
believe.  But the court looks at factors of settlement.
Excuse me.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the
