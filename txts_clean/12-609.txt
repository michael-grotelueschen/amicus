CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 12-609, Kansas v. Cheever.
General Schmidt.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEREK SCHMIDT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHMIDT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Once the Respondent made the trial decision
to make his mental status an issue and then supported
his argument by introducing, as evidence, the testimony
of a mental health expert who had examined the
defendant, he no longer could properly claim the
protection of the Fifth Amendment to avoid like kind
rebuttal by another court-appointed expert.
When the Kansas Supreme Court allowed the
Respondent to do just that, it committed constitutional
error and should be reversed for three reasons.  First,
this Court's cases point to the opposite conclusion.
Second, allowing this mental for mental expert rebuttal
is consistent with this Court's precedent with the
purposes of the Fifth Amendment, and it is fair.
And third, a holding that is consistent with
the Kansas Supreme Court's rule would have the effect of
undermining the truth-seeking function of the trial by
excluding relevant evidence from the jury, especially in
the mental health context where the jury has to make an
assessment based upon --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, that would --
that would be true, the last would be true, even if the
defendant had not sought to introduce expert evidence of
his own, right?
MR. SCHMIDT:  It -- that would be true, Your
Honor.  We're not asking for a rule that that's -- that
is that broad.  We're asking for a rule of parity that
allows that, once the defendant has opened the door by
putting his own expert on, the government may respond in
kind.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but just -- I have
the same concern as Justice Scalia.  I mean, that makes
your case easier, but it seems to me that the defendant
puts his mental capacity in issue and then testifies
himself, but with no expert, the State can still call
its own expert so far as the -- so far as the Federal
constitution is concerned.  There might be some Kansas
rules about it.
MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, that may well be
true, and the language of this Court's precedence
through Smith and Buchanan, for example, suggests that
the rule may be broader than the minimum that we're
asking for today.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, the issue is not
whether the State can call its own expert.  The issue is
whether the State can compel him to speak to its
expert --
MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- without which the expert
can testify, right?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes, Your Honor.  The -- the
Fifth Amendment, of course, is implicated when we're
talking about a mental health expert who has conducted
an examination of the defendant and the Respondent.
That's what we believe is appropriate here, in terms of
the parity rule.  Once the defendant puts on his expert,
who has done so, the government may respond in kind.
JUSTICE GINSBERG:  General -- general --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If I could just make -- it
seems to me that it's not necessary to make our decision
depend on whether or not another expert has been called.
That makes your case easier.  And sometimes, when we
write opinions, we take the easiest route.
But I take it, under your theory, even if
the defendant had not called his own expert, we would
still have the same issue before the Court, and you
would take the position that a prosecution expert can
testify.  Now, whether or not he can use the previous
statement, that's -- that's the second point.
MR. SCHMIDT:  And, Your Honor, the -- the
hypothetical Your Honor posits is closely related to the
second question Kansas presented, which was not granted
in this case, which would be the impeachment use once
the defendant himself has testified.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But he -- the defendant
would have to introduce the issue of his mental state,
either by his own testimony or an expert, but there's an
oddity about this case.
Do I understand correctly, General Schmidt,
that, if there had never been a Federal proceeding, if
this case had proceeded from start to finish in the
Kansas courts, there would have been no Welner evidence,
there would have been no prosecution expert, because it
wouldn't have been allowed under Kansas's own rules?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, Kansas law makes
the distinction between voluntary intoxication as a
defense and mental disease or defect as a defense.  And
it does provide a mechanism under the mental disease
pleadings for the obtaining of a court-ordered mental
evaluation, not under the other.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This -- this case was
voluntary intoxication and -- and under Kansas
procedure, the -- the prosecution could not have called
a witness absent insanity or a mental disease; is that
right?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Justice Ginsburg, it is
correct that Kansas could not have called a witness
under a voluntary intoxication defense -- could not have
obtained a court-ordered mental evaluation.  That is
correct.
The reason I didn't merely say yes is we do
have some disagreement with the other side that would be
dealt with in the courts below as to whether this truly
was a voluntary intoxication defense, since the other
side's expert did put the long-term effects on the
defendant's mental capacity into issue based on his
methamphetamine use.
JUSTICE ALITO:  General Schmidt, am I wrong
to think that the issue in this case is whether there
was compulsion at the time when the statement was made
to the -- the court-ordered expert?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Justice Alito --
JUSTICE ALITO:  That's the issue.  It's
not -- it wouldn't be a question of whether there was a
violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege at the time
when the statements were later introduced in the Kansas
trial.
Isn't it very well settled in this Court's
precedents that the introduction of statements
obtained -- that the introduction of statements at a
trial is not -- does not implicate the Fifth Amendment
privilege?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Well, Your Honor, the -- the
compulsion question is a threshold question.  And to the
extent this Court has recognized, for example, in cases
like Ventris, that there are truly compelled statements
in a Portash or Mincey sort of circumstance, that
threshold issue would resolve it.
This is not that case.  In fact, any
compulsion that might be involved here is much closer to
what happens when a defendant makes a trial decision to
offer himself as a witness and go on the stand, and
then, as a matter of operation of law, must subject
himself to cross-examination.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's the issue, as I
see it, but maybe I'm wrong -- correct me if I'm wrong,
and maybe Mr. Katyal will -- that the issue is whether
there was unconstitutional compulsion at the time when
the statements were obtained.  But I thought it was very
well settled that if there -- there wasn't compulsion at
that time, then the later introduction of the statements
into the -- into evidence at the trial does not
implicate the privilege against self-incrimination.
MR. SCHMIDT:  That would certainly be true,
Justice Alito, absolutely.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So what happened in -- in
State court really is -- is irrelevant to this.  This
is -- everything that -- everything important here was
done under Rule 12.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure and that's -- and that's the issue.
MR. SCHMIDT:  If the compulsion test settles
the matter, Justice Alito, yes, that is correct.  Even
if it doesn't settle the matter, we think there was then
subsequently a waiver at the time the evidence was
introduced in the State's trial.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but why doesn't it
settle the matter as a -- as you understand the case
that's being presented -- as a constitutional matter?
Sure.  Kansas may have some rules, maybe the judges say
I'm not going to hear this, this -- this is a State
rule, but insofar as the -- the Federal constitution is
concerned, why doesn't that settle it?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I think it can.
There is some dispute between the parties on whether
there is a sort of category of compulsion, called
something else perhaps, which doesn't rise to the
Portash-Mincey constitutional bar standard.
For example, the Respondent has argued that,
although this may not be like Portash and Mincey, there
is still, nonetheless, some inappropriate burden upon
the choice that was made and that that is somehow
constitutionally suspect.  So I'm merely trying not to
concede the ground that, even if -- and I agree with
you -- there was not constitutionally barred compulsion
here, still, there is a way for Kansas to prevail in the
case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But sort of coming back to
Justice Ginsburg's question, the Kansas Supreme Court
held that the introduction of -- of the allegedly
compelled testimony given to the -- to the psychiatrist
violated the Federal Constitution.  But why didn't --
why didn't the Kansas Supreme Court simply hold that
there was no -- no right on the part of the prosecution
to obtain that rebuttal evidence or to introduce it
since this was a case of voluntary intoxication?
You -- you tell me that Kansas does not
allow this just for voluntary intoxication, and that
was -- that was the defense he was raising, right?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I don't know why
the Kansas Supreme Court chose to settle this by
interpreting the Fifth Amendment in a manner that we
believe is incorrect, but nonetheless, that's what they
did.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what they did.  So
when -- when we send it back, is it still open to them
to decide that, under Kansas law, the testimony was not
introducible?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I suspect that, if
this case is remanded, there will be a variety of other
issues presented to the Kansas court, and it will have
to determine how to resolve them.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One issue is whether the
expert, the government's expert, went beyond the scope
of the direct, the experts for the defendant.  That's an
open -- that would be an open issue because I think
Rule -- the Federal Rule 12.2 is very clear that the
rebuttal testimony cannot exceed the scope of the
defense expert's testimony.
MR. SCHMIDT:  Justice Ginsburg, it may well
be likely that, upon remand, the scope issue would come
before the Kansas court to be resolved under principles
of Kansas evidentiary law.  In this case, of course,
while it's been argued at some length by Respondent, we
don't think the scope question is necessarily or
properly in front of this Court.
It was a threshold determination made by the
Kansas court that the Fifth Amendment keeps our rebuttal
witness off the stand at all, and we have to get past
that in order to get to related questions.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that is, as you say, a
question of -- of Kansas law, so it would be odd for us
to resolve that anyway.
MR. SCHMIDT:  Well, Your Honor, I think that
is a question of Fifth Amendment law.  The Kansas
Supreme Court interpreted the Fifth Amendment as
creating a bar upon Dr. Welner's testimony.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm saying the question of
whether the -- the cross-examination went beyond the
scope of the direct and whether that invalidated it,
that wouldn't be resolved under the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, but rather under Kansas law, right?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I believe that is
correct.  As a practical matter, this Court has
recognized, in the Fifth Amendment context, that there
are outer constitutional bounds with respect to scope,
for example, the relevancy statute you recognized in
both Brown and Magatha.
But those are not implicated here.  And as a
practical matter, the sorts of allegations that
Respondent is now making, although they weren't objected
to at trial with respect to specific aspects, would be
matters resolved under the Kansas Rules of Evidence.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Should we say anything
about that?  I mean, one of the things he testified
to -- that is, the government expert testified to -- the
defendant was one of those unusual people who was
actually exposed to a variety of different people in his
life.
He had people who were criminal types.
There were drug users.  He found himself identifying and
looking up to people alternatively described as "bad
boys" or “outlaws.” Looking up to them, being impressed
and awed by them and in certain circumstances, wanting
to outdo them.
Well, that doesn't seem to have much to do
with the issue that the defendant put into the -- wanted
to put in, in the Federal court, which was he wanted to
ask about his -- about his -- his words exactly are "a
defense of insanity," which can be interpreted broadly,
namely, whether he is insane or not.
So we both have the government expert saying
no, he's not insane, and the government expert going on
to give an explanation of why he shot the sheriff. So is
that -- is that, in your opinion, something we should
say that's a serious question, whether that exceeds it,
et cetera?  What should we say about it?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Justice Breyer, if the Court
wishes to speak to scope, I think it could reaffirm that
the constitutional standard, as it suggested in both
Magatha and Brown, is reasonably related or relevant to
the -- the direct examination.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So your words
would be, because they have introduced what we'd say as,
the defense has introduced an argument, that even if
it's proper for the introduction of the government's
expert witnesses under the Fifth Amendment, it still
cannot be beyond -- go beyond what is -- what's your
exact word, "reasonably" --
MR. SCHMIDT:  "Reasonably related" was the
phrase.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- reasonably related to
the defense of insanity that the defendant himself
raised, and then that would be an issue for the Kansas
court to decide.
MR. SCHMIDT:  And on the facts here, Your
Honor, we think there are very good facts on both sides,
that I suspect this Court doesn't want to --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you'd bring up
arguments why this is okay, and they would bring up
arguments why it isn't reasonably related, and Kansas
would decide.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I go back to the
line drawing?
MR. SCHMIDT:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I go back to the
line drawing?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes, ma'am.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  A question that some of
my colleagues have focused on. If we're to say that this
was not compelled speech, presumably, there'd be no
reason the government couldn't use this report, whether
or not the defendant put his or her mental state at
issue, because if it's not compelled, you could use it
as affirmative evidence, correct?
MR. SCHMIDT:  If it is not constitutionally
impermissible in the nature of the compulsion, yes, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Seems a somewhat --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If I may finish?
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes, sure.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Assuming that I'm
troubled by that holding, then what's the line we draw
with respect to the question Justice Kennedy asked you
as to when it is permissible.  You're saying, let's just
rule on the base.  When the defendant puts on an expert,
we can rebut with an expert.
But the broader question of if he puts his
mental state at issue without an expert, could you do
it?  Could you still put on his examination?  I'm not
sure you've really answered that question --
MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- which is how broadly
do we hold?  There's a waiver whenever you put in your
mental state at issue, or is it a waiver only when you
use an expert, and then the government is free to
respond with a compelled statement?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor.  I
think, if the Court wishes to go beyond the rule that
we're requesting in that regard, I would suggest it
analyze the factors that were articulated by the Court
in the Murphy case in 1964.  That would be the case
where the Court catalogued the values that are protected
by the Fifth Amendment prohibition on
self-incrimination -- mandatory self-incrimination.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't that an academic
question in this case?  After all, this expert for the
government came in when the case was in the Federal
system.  The Federal system has a rule that, when the
defense puts on an expert, the government can counter
it.
So the -- the limit would be -- I mean,
Kansas doesn't provide for this?  The Federal Rules
provide for it in a very limited way.  So to talk about
using it beyond the scope of the Federal rule seems to
me not the case that's before us.
MR. SCHMIDT:  I believe it is not the case
before us, Your Honor.  I believe we wouldn't want to
concede there are other circumstances where it might be
constitutionally permissible.
Mr. Chief Justice, with permission, I'd like
to reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you.
Ms. Saharsky.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY,
FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. SAHARSKY:  Mr.  Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
When a defendant puts his mental state at
issue through the testimony of an expert who's examined
him, the State may rebut that testimony with its own
expert who examined the defendant.  The Fifth Amendment
does not allow a defendant to put on his side of the
story and then deprive the prosecution of any meaningful
chance to respond.  And we think the close analogy here
is the situation where a defendant himself takes the
stand.
To the extent that the question -- the Court
has questions about scope of the government's ability to
respond, we think that those are answered, like the
General said, by the questions about when the defendant
takes the stand reasonably related to the subject matter
that the defense put on.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even if -- even if
the defendant does not submit an expert of his own, but
simply puts his mental state in issue?
MS. SAHARSKY:  I think that that's a
different case.  The Court's cases -- Estelle, Buchanan,
Powell -- have addressed an expert-for-expert situation.
And the specific rationale there is that this mental
health opinion testimony is different in that you really
can't have an expert give an opinion without examining
the defendant.
If we're talking about the defendant's
testimony, you know, he's not qualified to be an expert.
He can give factual statements about what happened to
him and what was happening at the time of the crime, but
he's not giving an expert opinion.  So, to us, it does
seem to be a different question about whether it's
really reasonable to have an expert to rebut that
testimony.  The Court just doesn't need to decide that
question in this case.
There's also a second question that the
General alluded to, which is, if he makes factual
statements during his mental examination, the defendant,
and then also gets up on the stand at trial, testifies
and says something contrary -- you know, whether you
could use those for impeachment purposes, the court
didn't grant that question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why would it only be
for -- why would it only be for impeachment purposes?
It's directed at some statements that he said, which are
not going -- not terribly pertinent to the mental
diagnosis, but valuable evidence, and the defendant
takes the stand; can the government call -- here's this
person, he happens to be the doctor that took the -- the
examination, but he learned some things here that we
think are helpful.
MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, I think this goes back
to the questions that Justice Alito started asking
about, which have to do with where there is compulsion
here, if at all.  This is a -- a unique situation in
that there is a court-ordered mental exam, but it only
happens as a result of the defendant's choice to give
the notice of putting on the defense, and then the
evidence for the exam, at least under the rules, never
comes in until he puts on his evidence first.
It's really a parity principle that the
Court recognized in Estelle and in Buchanan.  In those
cases, we read them to -- for the Court to have said
that there is sufficient compulsion in the ordering of
the exam to raise Fifth Amendment questions.
But when the defendant opens the door, the
Fifth Amendment just doesn't give him any right to -- to
stop the prosecution from responding.  But if the Court
wanted to find that there was no compulsion and these
statements could be used for any purposes, we think that
would be more than the Court said in those prior cases.
But this is a different situation in that it
is the defendant's choice that -- that affects whether
this is ever going to come in.  This is not the type of
Portash-compelled testimony, where you're set before a
grand jury and have to either self-incriminate, be in
contempt, or commit perjury.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Saharsky --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't the question here
whether Rule 12.2 is constitutional?  Everything that
was done here seems to me to have been done in
compliance with Rule 12.2 of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, so if there's -- insofar as the
taking of the statement is concerned, which I'm
suggesting is the issue and not the later introduction
in the Kansas court.  Am I wrong on that?
MS. SAHARSKY:  Well -- well, if the question
is, is Rule .12 constitutional, we think the answer is,
pretty clearly, yes.  If you look at the way that that
rule has evolved, it's evolved in response to this
Court's decisions about the understanding of the Fifth
Amendment, that there's a like-for-like principle, that
when the defendant puts this in issue, that the State
can respond in kind.
The Kansas Supreme Court thought that there
was a separate issue because of the specific Kansas
rules.  But as the General suggested -- you know,
those -- the Kansas rules may be a -- there may be a
Kansas problem that has a Kansas law solution, but
Federal constitutional law just doesn't depend on -- on
the State rules of evidence.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm wondering whether you
way over read the cases that you rely on because in all
of those cases what we were talking about was an
examination that had specifically requested by the
defendant.  Now, here, that's not the case.  The
defendant has asked for something and has opened the
door, conceivably.
But the examination that we're talking about
is one that the State has compelled and that the
defendant does not wish to undergo.  That's a big
difference between this case and all the ones you rely
on.
MS. SAHARSKY:  That's a factual difference
from, for example, Buchanan and Powell.  But we think
the key principle is the one that comes through in the
Court's cases that, if the defendant opens the door, the
State can respond.  And we think that the Court -- that
the Court repeated that principle numerous times.  In
Buchanan, it said, on page 425 of the decision, defense
counsel is on notice that, if you open the door, the
government can rebut.
And it's actually interesting.  I think
every member of the Court understood, although it wasn't
clear from the majority opinion, that that could mean a
separate examination.  And I would point the Court to
Justice Marshall's dissent, footnote 5, where he says,
"Of course, you could have your own separate
examination."
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Not to belabor this, but
the -- the holding of the case is that the prosecution
may rebut this presentation with evidence from the
reports of the examination that the defendant's
requested.
MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  That -- that was the
specific holding based on the facts of that case, but
because the Court --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean -- I guess the
question is that you say it's a factual difference; it
might be a factual difference between compulsion and
lack of compulsion.
MS. SAHARSKY:  Okay.  And if the Court wants
to say that there is sufficient compulsion here in the
ordering of the mental state exam, despite the fact that
there was the initial choice by the defendant, we would
say the defendant's choice at trial to put on his
testimony is what makes this -- this evidence available
to the government to use in rebuttal.
So it's fine that Buchanan does not decide
the exact facts of this case.  You could say that the
holding does not decide this case, but we think it comes
pretty darn close because the Court's rationale was
whether the defendant opened the door.  It said, again
and again, did the defendant open the door, and if he
does, the State needs this evidence to have any
effective means of rebuttal.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait.  I mean, all
the State -- I think it oversimplifies it to say that
when -- when the defendant puts it at issue, the
government can respond.  Yes, the government -- the
government can respond with whatever evidence it has,
but the issue here is not whether the government can
respond.
The issue is whether the government can
compel the defendant to undergo a psychiatric
examination.  That's -- that's quite a different issue
really from whether the government can respond.  Of
course it can respond.
MS. SAHARSKY:  That's right.  The rule that
we've -- we're asking this Court to adopt is -- you
know, the same one that we think was at least hinted at
in the decisions in -- in Estelle v. Smith and in
Buchanan, which is when the defense is putting on an
expert above his mental state that is testifying to an
opinion based on an examination, that the State also can
have its own expert that testifies as to mental state
based on an examination.
We think this is a unique situation.  We
think that's all the Court needs to do to decide this
case.  To put it simply --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  More precisely, it's not
that the State can have its own expert.  It's that the
State can compel the defendant to testify to an
expert -- can compel the defendant to speak to a
psychiatrist.  That's really the issue, not -- not
whether the government can respond.  Of course, it can
respond.
MS. SAHARSKY:  Sure.  The implication is
that the -- the State has the same access to the
defendant as the defense expert had because the State's
expert is unable to come up with an opinion without a
personal examination of the defendant.  This was
explained very well in your decision for the plurality
of the D.C. Circuit in Byers, which is --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So is that a waiver theory?
Because Justice Scalia's opinion was not based on a
waiver theory.  But my understanding of your brief was
that you were arguing about waiver, is that right?  That
the -- the defendant here has waived the ability to say
that he's being compelled?
MS. SAHARSKY:  We've called it a waiver by
the defendant's conduct for two reasons.  One, that's
what this Court called it in Powell, when it was
describing its holding in Buchanan; two, that's what
this Court has called it -- and I'd point you to page 15
of the gray brief -- in the cases about what happens
when a defendant takes the stand, that, in the act of
taking the stand, he has waived his Fifth Amendment
rights.
But you don't have to call it a waiver.  The
point is that the Fifth Amendment does not extend so far
as the defendant claims.  It doesn't allow him to both
put on his side of the story and then claim that the
government can't have a chance for any meaningful
rebuttal.
So -- you know, we -- we really don't think
that that label matters.  We think that the Byers D.C.
Circuit plurality, we think that the Pope decision that
was well before this Court's decision in Estelle by
then-Judge Blackmun, which said -- you know, call it
either way -- you know, the result is the same, which is
that this evidence can come in.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you suggesting that
the government can answer in -- in a like manner as the
defendant?  The defendant opens the door by experts,
then the government can call experts?  That is not to
say that a defendant simply offers his own testimony,
the government can do something that -- that the defense
has not opened the door to.
MS. SAHARSKY:  That's right.  The State has
an expert who examined -- the defense has an expert who
examined the defendant; the State can use an expert who
examined the defendant.  It's a parity principle there.
It's a different question about trying to rebut or
impeach the defendant's own statements.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I'm presuming that
if a defendant takes the stand and says something
completely contrary to what he tells a government
psychiatrist, that you would rely on the Brown line of
cases, that you could cross-examine him on the contrary
statement to the psychiatrist.
MS. SAHARSKY:  Again, we think that's the
second question presented that the court didn't grant,
but there are good arguments for why the defendant, once
he opens the door, should not be able to slam it shut.
Also, we think this Court's cases, like Ventris, that
have to do with the recent cases on impeachment, would
go to this.
Now, there's a question about whether it's a
difference that it's the defendant's own statements, as
opposed to an expert's opinion, based on his statement.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that would be a
different issue.  I'm just talking about whatever
statements he made.  But don't -- the light is on.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, your time
has expired.
MS. SAHARSKY:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr.  Katyal.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The State is trying to use Scott Cheever's
words to execute him.  That's wrong for many reasons,
but the simplest one is that, whatever the scope of the
Fifth Amendment waiver may be in this case, the
prosecution here exceeded it.  Scott Cheever's words
were uttered in the context of an uncounseled,
un-Mirandized, 5-1/2 hour jail exam that the State made
him undergo as the price for putting on his voluntary
intoxication defense.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr.  Katyal, if this had
played out entirely in the Federal court, the
examination of the defendant was pursuant to Federal
Rule 12.2.  Your argument seems to be that Rule 12.2
violates the Fifth Amendment.  I mean, the mental
examination was ordered in the Federal court after the
defendant said, I am going to put on a couple of
witnesses -- expert witnesses, to testify to my mental
state.
Rule 12.2 says, when a defendant does that,
then the government has the right to have the defendant
examined by its expert.  So the broad argument that
you're making seems to lead inevitably to the conclusion
that Rule 12.2 is unconstitutional.
MR. KATYAL:  Your Honor, we think that
that's partially right.  That is, our argument
ultimately does invalidate a small part of the
application of 12.2(d), and for that reason, we think
that the Court should avoid that constitutional question
by focusing on the scope question, which is a federal
Fifth Amendment question, Justice Scalia, not one of
Kansas law.
And if I could walk you through our 12.2
thinking, 12.2(d) excludes testimony from the defense
expert, or it may.  It's permissive.  And so to the
extent that a trial judge -- a Federal judge, excluded
evidence that the defendant wanted to put on because he
didn't -- because he didn't submit to the exam or the
like, we do think that that application would be
violated.
JUSTICE ALITO:  That would be -- that's not
a -- that's not a self-incrimination question, though,
isn't it?  It's a due process question.  It's an
unreasonable limitation on the defendant's ability to
put on a defense.
MR. KATYAL:  Your Honor, it's the clash
between -- it's just like Simmons.  It's the clash
between two different constitutional rights, the right
to put on an effective defense on the one hand or the
right that is burden -- the right of self-incrimination on the
other.  And it's that choice, Your Honor, which we find
makes the compulsion necessary -- compulsion --
JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but there wouldn't be at
that point -- suppose the Federal rules simply said you
can't have an expert testify about mental condition,
period.  That's a -- that raises a due process issue,
and maybe there would be a serious due process question
involved.
MR. KATYAL:  Quite --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.
MR. KATYAL:  Quite right.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Up to that point, we're not
quite at the Fifth Amendment.
MR. KATYAL:  Quite right, Your Honor.  But
when a State like Kansas offers the voluntary
intoxication defense -- makes it part of the State's
burden to prove as an element of the offense and then
conditions that by saying, well, if you put that
evidence on, you then have to pay the price, submit to a
5-1/2 hour, uncounseled, un-Mirandized investigation
that goes far beyond what the voluntary intoxication
is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You're - you're -- the
State admits that all that they could put on is
information from the psychiatrist that is reasonably
related to the defense that the defendant raised.  Do
you disagree with that?
MR. KATYAL:  No.  We -- Your Honor, we
agree, and we think that this case, obviously --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Then we both
agree --
MR. KATYAL:  We agree on the legal standard.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  You both agree that
the test is "reasonably related."  So we could simply
say that.  They both agree.
MR. KATYAL:  And that's what we think you
should say, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And now, we send it back to
the Kansas court and say, we are not going to go through
the record here because you should do it.
MR. KATYAL:  That's precisely right, Justice
Breyer.  Both sides are agreeing on the legal standard.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Then why are we here?
Everybody agrees.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, that is -- that is,
ultimately, what we think -- and it avoids the
constitutional question by doing that.  And this case
has never -- this Court has never squarely held that the
legal proposition that both sides are now in agreement
on --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But Kansas decided the
constitutional question, and we can't send it back
unless we reverse the Supreme Court of Kansas.  So you
say we're going to dodge the constitutional question?
How can we?  I think it has been decided by the Kansas
Supreme Court.
MR. KATYAL:  Your Honor, I think you can
vacate the decision of the Kansas Supreme Court and
remand for them to look at whether or not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  On what basis can we
vacate?  We can't vacate a decision, unless there's
something wrong with it.  What's wrong with it?
MR. KATYAL:  Well, that it -- that it
reached to ultimately decide this constitutional
question on 12.2 that it didn't have to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's -- that's error?  I
mean, I understand it's general policy you don't reach a
constitutional question unless you have to, but I've
never heard of the proposition that, if a court
unnecessarily reaches a constitutional question, it can
be reversed, that we can send it back and say, don't
reach the constitutional question.
MR. KATYAL:  Your Honor, I certainly think
that's available to you, particularly in the context of
this case, in which there is such an interrelationship
between the scope issue and the ultimate merits question
of the Fifth Amendment.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think so.  Kansas
decided the constitutional question.  We took the case
in order to decide that, and I think we have to decide
it.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, Justice Scalia, if I
could just try -- try -- if you look at even Kansas's
opening brief at page 9, at page 12, at page 40, at page
42, it's all about the scope question.  That's their
opening brief.  And so we think that they are integrally
bound up.  Be that as it may, it might not --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the scope question
wasn't decided by the Kansas court, and they wouldn't
get to it, unless they held that, yes, you can have this
rebuttal testimony.  Then the next question is, if you
can have it, how far it can go?
But the anterior question, can you have it
at all, is the question the Kansas Supreme Court
answered, no, you cannot have it.  And we can't send it
back to them without -- I mean, if -- if you can't have
it at all, then it's irrelevant that the scope was too
broad.
MR. KATYAL:  That's quite right.  Our
broadest position -- and we think the one that -- that
also disposes of this case, is the idea, as Justice
Scalia was saying to my colleague on the other side,
that what's at issue here is not whether or not the
State -- whether or not the State can follow where the
defense has led, but rather how can they follow.
And here, the State is doing something that
there is literally -- that this Court has never squarely
authorized.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr.  Katyal, would you --
you said, in answer to my question, that Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 12.2 violates the Fifth Amendment in
small part.  Can you be explicit?  The rule, as I
understand it, says if the defendant is going to
introduce evidence concerning his mental state, then the
government has a right to have the government's expert
examine the defendant and rebut what the defendant's
experts say.
That's what the rule is.  And then it says,
you can't go beyond the scope of that issue -- of the
mental state.
MR. KATYAL:  I think that's mostly right.
I'd like to be a little bit -- break down the rule a
little bit.  12.2(d) has the provision which says that
if you -- that the price of not submitting to the exam
is the exclusion of the defense expert, so we think
that -- it's a permissive rule, but if it's applied, we
think that's unconstitutional.
There are other points of 12.2 which don't
raise --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You think it's
unconstitutional to say to the defendant, you have a
choice; if you introduce this testimony, then the
government can follow where you have led; if you don't
introduce the testimony, then of course, the government
has nothing to rebut?
MR. KATYAL:  I don't think that's what
12.2(c)(4) says.  Rather, what 12.2(c)(4) says is
that -- that the State can introduce expert testimony on
an issue regarding mental condition on which the
defendant has introduced evidence.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.
MR. KATYAL:  And it's not clear to me
whether or not that's talking about a Buchanan
situation, one in which the defense has requested the
exam or not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It says, "on which the
defendant has introduced evidence."  The evidence is the
defendant's expert.
MR. KATYAL:  Exactly.  And so to the extent,
Your Honor, that it's used to -- to introduce, as it was
in this case, evidence that -- that the defendant's own
words against him, yes, we think that 12.2 raises a deep
constitutional question, something which this Court has
never --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, there is nothing
unusual about saying, if the defendant introduces
certain evidence, he has to forfeit some of his Fifth
Amendment self-incrimination rights.
MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It happens every time the
defendant chooses to testify.
MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He need not testify, but if
he introduces that evidence, he must submit to
cross-examination and has to incriminate himself.  And
this is, it seems to me, quite similar.  He need not
introduce the evidence of the psychiatrist, but if he
does, he has to forfeit his Fifth Amendment right not to
talk to a psychiatrist.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, we agree with the first
75 percent of that; that is, that, certainly, it's the
case that when the defendant takes the stand, they are
subject to cross-examination.  Cheever took the stand.
He is subject to cross-examination.  Cheever's expert
takes the stand, Evans.  He is subject to
cross-examination.
But the question here is whether or not the
State can go further and force someone to submit to a
mental health evaluation and use that against them.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that.  But
it's still -- it's still the same -- the same
correlative system playing --
MR. KATYAL:  No, it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If the defendant does one
thing, he has to accept what goes along with it, and
that includes waiving or forfeiting his -- his right not
to incriminate himself.
MR. KATYAL:  I don't think so.  I don't
think that's how it plays out.  So, for example, if this
were an accounting case -- a criminal accounting case,
and the defendant had talked to -- the CEO of the
company had talked to an accounting expert, walked them
through all the books and so on and said, here's what
happened, and so on, and the expert took the stand, I
don't think the state could then force their expert to
talk to the defendant and have that evidence introduced
against the defendant.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not getting into the
defendant's mind.
MR. KATYAL:  Oh, I think that cuts the other
way.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's only the psychiatrist
who can get into the defendant's mind when he is -- when
he is raising a mental capacity defense.
MR. KATYAL:  And, Justice Scalia, that
precisely cuts the other way.  This Court, in Couch v.
United States, said that's the heart of what the Fifth
Amendment is about, the intrusion into a defendant's
mind, and here, this case is a perfect illustration of
that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's just the fact
that the evidence here is based on the defendant's
statements.  If you had a physical object, you wouldn't
say it's the -- the murder weapon.  You wouldn't say
that, if the defendant submits a study about the murder
weapon, the ballistics, this and that, you wouldn't say,
well, all the government can do is cross-examine the
defendant's expert.  You say, no, they get to do their
own study.
The reality of what makes this different is
that here, when you're submitting and preparing
psychiatric evidence, it's based on -- the ballistics
testing is statements from -- from the defendant, and it
seems to me unfair to say the defendant's expert has
access to that ballistics evidence, but the State does
not.
MR. KATYAL:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think what
does the work in your ballistics example is precisely
that it isn't the defendant's own words; it's something
else, and so it's wholly outside of the Fifth Amendment.
What we are talking about here in this circumstance is
Scott Cheever's own words to the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  I understand
that.  But it just so happens that the way you do the --
the testing on the evidence when you're talking about
psychiatric evidence is to ask questions of the
defendant.  That's how you do it.  That's the parallel
to whatever ballistics tests they do on the -- on the
firearm.
MR. KATYAL:  Yes, but I think the Fifth
Amendment imposes a different value judgment of our
founders, based on this type of situation in which you
are peering into the defendant's mind.  I think that's
what the language in Couch v. United States is all
about, that there is a difference between --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, we're going -- we're
going right back -- the defense expert here peered into
his mind.  It's set out in the appendix.  It's confusing
because there's a Dr. Evans and also an Attorney
Evans.
MR. KATYAL:  Exactly.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the -- the expert is
Dr. Evans.  He peers into the defendant's mind.
Now, are -- is this case any different and
any better for you because it happened in State court?
Suppose everything here happened in the Federal court,
would you have a constitutional objection?
MR. KATYAL:  We would have a constitutional
objection.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that constitutional
objection would be?
MR. KATYAL:  Exactly what I was saying to
Justice Ginsburg, that this choice -- a Simons-like
choice was forced upon the defendant.  He could either
put on his defense --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So in your view -- in your
view, the defendant can be interviewed by his own
psychiatrist, but not by a prosecution psychiatrist?
MR. KATYAL:  That -- that is correct, Your
Honor.  But, of course, the State can cross-examine
our -- our psychiatrist and every word --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Katyal, if that's
your position, then you must disagree with the D.C.
Circuit decision, which was already mentioned, United
States against Byers, which took the position that,
where the defendant leads, the government may follow.
For the very reason that the defense expert
has access to the defendant, you can't disarm the
government by saying, we're not going to let you have a
counter-expert.  All you can do is cross-examine the
defendant's expert.
MR. KATYAL:  We -- we do ultimately
disagree, Your Honor, with the bottom-line holding in
the Byers case that -- that yourself and Justice Scalia
was on.  We think that that reasoning -- the way that
the Court got there was to say that there was a
policy-based reason under the Fifth Amendment that
allowed this.  It wasn't waiver, which you've been
hearing about.
It was a policy-based reason.  And frankly,
I think that, ultimately, this is a -- the governments'
argument, both governments, is an argument in search of
a theory.  We've heard a bunch of different ones.  We've
heard the Byers one about policy.  We've heard Justice
Alito's question --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I didn't know that it was
policy.  I thought it was -- it was saying it is just
like the defendant gets on the stand; he's subject to
cross-examination.  The defendant puts on experts; the
government must be treated equally, must be able to put
on its own experts.
And as far as waiver, that's a fiction,
isn't it?  The defendant could say, 100 times, I'm going
to testify, but I'm not waiving my Fifth Amendment
privilege.  It wouldn't matter if he said that 100
times.  He will be exposed to cross-examination.
MR. KATYAL:  But, Justice Ginsburg, we think
that Byers -- ultimately, the language, the way it got
there was purely policy.  And we think that this Court
has, in the 30 years since Byers, really changed to the
game on the use of policy-based reasoning when it comes
to the Fifth Amendment.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but if that's policy,
why isn't the -- the cross-examination analogy policy as
well?  I mean, they are both based on some notion of
what is parity and what's reciprocity and what's -- you
know, what's appropriate to ask the defendant to bear
once the defendant decides to become a witness in a
proceeding.
So they are both the same kind of policy.
You want to call it that, but it's -- it's -- one is no
more policy than the other.
MR. KATYAL:  I don't quite think that's
right.  The text of the Fifth Amendment is that a
defendant can't be "compelled" to be a witness.  And
once a defendant takes the stand and acts as a witness,
then it seems to me that is behavior inconsistent, as
Berghuis v. Thompson suggests, with the invocation of
the Fifth Amendment privilege.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you give me the -- can
you give me the black letter formulation that you are
asking this Court to adopt?  It violates the Fifth
Amendment when?
MR. KATYAL:  When a defendant is forced to
undergo a psychological examination as the price for
putting on his mental state defense, at least -- at
least when it's an element of the offense.  We don't
think you have to get into, as our brief explains,
affirmative defenses like the Federal defense --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  When you say as the price
for putting on his defense, you mean as the price for
introducing the testimony of a psychological expert?
MR. KATYAL:  That is correct, Justice
Scalia.
JUSTICE BREYER:  The authority for that is
what?
MR. KATYAL:  It's -- it's several cases, but
I think Simmons is the best case.  Justice Harlan's
opinion for seven justices --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean -- you know,
the obvious, it's not a question of policy.  But one
thing, the Fifth Amendment prevents you from being a
witness against yourself, you didn't take the stand.  So
what you did was introduced three psychiatrists, and
they said, this man was totally insane, he could form no
will whatsoever, totally insane.
The government says, we have seven
psychiatrists who would like to examine this man, and
they'll come to the opposite conclusion.  The judge
says, okay, examine him, under compulsion.  And they say
he is totally sane.  And they each have reasons.
Now, you're saying, in that case, the
government cannot put any of those seven on the stand?
MR. KATYAL:  Oh, disagree entirely.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Really?
MR. KATYAL:  The government can put experts
on, psychiatric experts, but they can't put on --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but they -- they
base their testimony on an examination compelled by
the --
MR. KATYAL:  That's the problem, absolutely.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So you --
MR. KATYAL:  And that is wholly foreign --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But that -- that puts the
government in a -- in an impossible position.  The
defense is allowed witnesses who've examined the
defendant and -- oh, you mean you're only limiting it to
the case where the defense witnesses don't examine the
defendant?
MR. KATYAL:  I'm saying that -- that in a
circumstance -- that, either way, if it's the price for
putting on the defense, then, yes, it's
unconstitutional.
JUSTICE BREYER:  You're -- I'm giving you a
hypothetical.
MR. KATYAL:  I don't think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Psychiatrist A, hired by
the defense, examines the witness.  He says he is
totally mad.  All right?  That's his conclusion based on
the examination.  Psychiatrist B, who works for the
government, has examined the witness under compulsion.
All right?  And he's done it under the authority of 12.2
because the defendant, just as here, made a 12.2 motion
and said that this was a -- all right, just like here.
He examines him.  He comes to the conclusion
this man is as sane as -- whatever the most sane thing
is.  All right.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's his conclusion.
You're saying the government can put on its
witnesses, but the Fifth Amendment prohibits the --
sorry, the defense can put on its witness, but the --
the Fifth Amendment prohibits the defendant from putting
on its own witness?
MR. KATYAL:  No.  The Fifth Amendment
prohibits --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That means it's
something -- I can't imagine how the Fifth Amendment can
say that.  But go ahead.
MR. KATYAL:  That is not our argument.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What is your argument?
MR. KATYAL:  The prosecution can still put
on an expert witness; they just can't --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  They put on my
witness, my imaginary psychiatrist A.
MR. KATYAL:  Your imaginary psychiatrist
can't be put on under our system and, indeed, under
Kansas's own system, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that may be, but does
the Federal Constitution -- it's my example.  It's my
example.
MR. KATYAL:  I think it does.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Because --
MR. KATYAL:  This Court has never once
accepted the idea that a -- that the government can
force someone to talk to your psychiatrist B and
introduce his own words against him.  That's what the
Fifth Amendment is about, and I understand, sure, the
government isn't going to have the evidence that it
wants.
It's going to be the price of the Fifth
Amendment.  That's what it --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose we -- suppose
we agree with you, and the response is the adoption of a
new Federal rule of evidence or a State rule of evidence
that says that evidence of a -- that an expert who
testifies for the defense as to the mental -- the
insanity or mental state of a defendant is very
unreliable, if there has not been an opportunity for the
defendant to be examined by another expert and,
therefore, is just inadmissible.  You can't do it at
all.
Would there be a constitutional problem with
that?
MR. KATYAL:  If it's -- it's simply a rule
of evidence that doesn't condition one right against the
other, no, I don't think so.  It would go back to your
earlier question --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What do we do with this?
The defense says, my defense will consist of the fact
demonstrated by an expert that my heart is too weak to
have made it up the stairs.  All right.  And I have
Mister -- Dr. Smith, who has examined my heart, and he
will testify it's impossible I could have been on the
third floor, I would have been dead.
So the government says, we would like to
have you examined by our doctor, Dr. B, who we believe
will -- and the judge orders it.  All right.  So now,
Dr. B says, his heart is sound as an ox, and he goes to
it.  You're saying the government could not put that
Dr. B on the stand?
MR. KATYAL:  I think that's right, Justice
Breyer.  The idea that the government can force someone
to undergo a mental -- or, excuse me, a physical
evaluation and maybe extract stuff from their body as
the price for putting on a defense, yeah, I think that
raises some Fifth Amendment questions --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Katyal, assuming the
incredulity of my colleagues continues with your
argument, which way would you rather lose?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On a waiver theory or on
a lack of compulsion theory?  And pick one and tell us
the reason why that's preferable to the other.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, certainly, I think lack
of compulsion is not something that really is being
advanced by the government in this case.  Even their
opening lines of their oral argument are focusing on
waiver, not that.  And I think it would raise any number
of concerns, like the ones you suggested, to go on a
compulsion theory, that it would allow introduction of
evidence, even if the defendant hasn't led in that
direction.
But I would like to try and take another
shot at persuading your colleagues --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Katyal, could I go back
to the cross-examination analogy?  Because you say your
case is different, but I think you'll have to explain
that one to me.  It seems to me that the
cross-examination cases say you can't become a witness
halfway.  Once you've decided to become a witness, you
have to subject yourself to all the things that every
other witness is subjected to.
And it seems to me that you haven't
convinced me that the same point isn't true here, that
the person, Mr. Cheever, has decided to become a
witness, essentially, by giving an interview to his own
expert and allowing his own expert to speak about what
Mr. Cheever has told him.  And so -- you know, he can't
do it halfway.  Now, the government has to get its shot.
Same way.
MR. KATYAL:  I don't quite think that the
cross-examination cases go so far as to say that it
leads to the same way and gets you so far as to say that
if someone testifies by -- if an expert testifies using
the defendant's own words, that that opens the door to
the prosecution doing so.
There is something unique about the Fifth
Amendment, and the idea that the government can peer
into someone's mind and extract information out of them
in an uncounseled, un-Mirandized 5-1/2 hour session, and
have that used against them at trial.  And the price
that Cheever paid here was an extraordinary one.
He put on a defense that has been a defense
for hundreds of years, the idea of voluntary
intoxication, and he was told the cost of doing that was
that this exam took place and all of this evidence
ranging about outlaws and so on was introduced --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's something of
an overstatement because he also had the psychiatrist
who testified that, in his expert opinion, he did not
have the requisite mental state, and he -- and he
prefaced that by indicating how many people he had
examined that had used meth and there was neurotoxicity,
so this defense expert did testify to that.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, he certainly testified
to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So I think you quite
overstate when you say the fact the defendant testified.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, what the defense expert
testified to, voluntary incapacitation under
methamphetamine, and, certainly, the prosecution expert
did that as well, but then the prosecution expert went a
lot further to talk about his -- it's a suggested
anti-social personality disorder, to suggest outlaws,
and the outlaws evidence was introduced by the State
first in the context of direct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's scope issues.
That's not right issues.
MR. KATYAL:  Right, but I think it does bear
on when you think about whether the Simmons analogy
makes sense, whether or not forcing a defendant as the
price of the defense to open the door to all of this
evidence being introduced against him, that is not
really a choice at all.  That is ultimately --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Katyal, you have
conceded, I think, in response to Justice Alito's
question, that the rules could be changed to say,
defendant, you cannot put on these experts.  So how does
that maybe help defendants who want to put on a defense
of mental state?  You can't put it on, unless the
government can put it on.  That's the current rule.
But you're saying the response to it can be
this evidence is shut out entirely.  The government --
the government will have nothing to answer if the
defendant doesn't put on experts.  I'm not so sure that
would be a rule that defense counsel would put on.
MR. KATYAL:  I'm not sure that they would
favor it or not.  Our argument is simply that, when a
state such as Kansas recognizes the voluntary
intoxication defense and doesn't have all these witness
rules, that Cheever is entitled to put on that effective
defense and not have that right to clash against his
Fifth Amendment right.
And, indeed, the fact that the State has all
sorts of options available to it like expert -- like
expert evidentiary rules or even abolishing the
involuntary intoxication defense altogether is the true
answer to the policy concerns, not trying to jigger into
the Fifth Amendment, somehow some exception that allows
for psychiatric exams by criminal defendants.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'll bet you the
prosecution would accept your alternative in a
heartbeat.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No defendant can introduce
any psychiatric evidence.  That's a good deal for the
prosecution.
MR. KATYAL:  It may be.  It may not be.
That's something the legislature would hammer out, but I
think that's where the policy objection --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you need to
hammer out?  You said that the rule now is no good
because it allows government psychiatrists to have
access to the defendant -- compelled access.  That rule
is no good, but the alternative of not allowing this
evidence at all, what is there to hammer out?
MR. KATYAL:  We think that, if the Court
follows our rule, which suggests that you can't put the
defendant to this choice, the State has the option of
modifying the voluntary intoxication defense, possibly
making it an affirmative defense or putting restrictions
on experts, any number of things that may be possible in
that circumstance or the legislative process, not
through some Fifth Amendment interpretation of this
Court, to try and deal with a policy concern.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there really a huge
difference between mental state as an element of the
offense and mental state as an affirmative defense?  I
mean, in reality, doesn't -- doesn't the mental state
argument of the defendant function as an affirmative
defense to premeditated murder?
Government has the burden of proof on mental
state, but it -- it operates, as far as a defendant is
concerned, if the defendant is able to show this
voluntary intoxication, that would be a defense to
premeditated murder.
MR. KATYAL:  No, Your Honor, our brief at
page 36 points out that, under Kansas law, it's an
element of the offense, they bear the burden of proof.
In the Sixth Circuit decision in United States v. Davis,
I think, explains that in a circumstance like this --
like involuntary intoxication, the defendant is not
interjecting some new issue into the trial.
The defendant is simply rebutting the
premeditation argument, which is their burden to prove.
And if you accept their argument here, you're
essentially saying that the defendant's own words can be
used by the State to shoulder the load against him.  And
that is something foreign to the Fifth Amendment.
It may be something you want to do for
policy reasons, I understand that, but it is not
something this Court has ever accepted.
If there are no other questions?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
Mr. Katyal.
General Schmidt, you have four minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEREK SCHMIDT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHMIDT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I would just like to refocus on what has
happened in this case.  The Kansas Supreme Court
interpreted -- or we believe misinterpreted the Fifth
Amendment to say that, once the defendant had put his
own expert on the stand to testify in support of his
mental health claim after this expert had examined the
defendant, the government couldn't respond in kind.  And
it's that bar on our participating in the fact-finding in
front of the jury that we are seeking to have overturned
here.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I think what he's saying is
that, look, in Simmons, there is a Fourth Amendment
problem, and the defendant wants to testify in a Fourth
Amendment hearing.  And if he does, the State will take
that statement and use it at the trial.
So because of the reasons -- I'd say the
policies underlying the Fourth Amendment, the court
says, that's wrong.  He can go testify at the
suppression hearing, and then they can't use his
statement later.  So by analogy, he says, it's a similar
situation.  He says, it's the policy behind the Fifth
Amendment that says, if you're going to go see the
government under compulsion -- the psychiatrist, you
shouldn't be able to introduce that later.
I mean, I think that's, in my looking at
them -- because I'm trying to see if I got the argument
basically right, which is what I wanted to find out, and
now, what's the response to that particular argument?
MR. SCHMIDT:  I think, Your Honor, the
Simmons circumstance is not applicable here, and, in
fact, the Court would have to substantially expand
Simmons in order to find it to fit these facts.
JUSTICE BREYER:  You'd have to say then
there's difference between the Fifth Amendment and the
Fourth Amendment, and that difference would be what?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Well, Your Honor, in the
Simmons case, what the government sought to do was to
take the defendant's unvarnished statements from the
prior hearing and to introduce them without the
defendant having put those issues into the fact-finding
portion of the trial as affirmative evidence in the
government's case-in-chief.  In that regard, it is much
more like Smith on its facts, where the court said, even
in the circumstances we're confronted with here, on
those facts, we can't do it.
The court specifically said later, in the
Salvucci case, that it hadn't addressed the question in
Simmons as to whether or not the government could use
that evidence from the suppression hearing for
impeachment purposes, which is much more analogous here.
So it's an open question, even under
Simmons, even if it applied, and the Court would have to
extend it in that regard.  The Court, I would suggest,
shouldn't extend Simmons in that regard because, at the
end of the day, the other differing -- different factor
here -- and it goes to the line of question that started
earlier -- is that there is something different, as the
Court has repeatedly emphasized, in the nature that --
the actual nature of use and obtaining of mental health
evidence.  That's the ink that fires.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- what
happens if the defendant is going through this
examination, they ask him this, he tells them this,
that, and all of a sudden, they ask him a question, he
said, I'd rather not answer that.  I mean, is he
allowed -- allowed to do that?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why?  Because it
might incriminate me?
MR. SCHMIDT:  In fact, on the record here,
the government's expert, Dr. Welner, specifically
advised the Respondent, before the examination began,
that if at any point he wanted to terminate the
examination, he was free to do so.  So I think yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's a little bit
different.  I understand terminate, then they'd say,
well, look, you don't get to put your expert in.  But
what if it's just -- you know, particular questions?
What happens then?
MR. SCHMIDT:  Well, on -- on particular
questions, I suppose the Respondent could invoke at that
time.  But more importantly, before any of that could be
introduced at trial, there would be a report generated
by the expert, and all counsel, including the
Respondent's counsel, would have ability to review it
and seek some sort of pretrial order to keep out any
particularly offensive materials.
There are mechanisms to resolve any problems
like that, that might arise.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not quite sure I
understand why we shouldn't follow the Simmons analogy
because, as I understand it, we haven't ruled on the
last question of whether you can use the compelled
statements as impeachment.  But if we assume that to be
the case, most circuits who have addressed the issue,
and I think it may be all of them, have said you can
because there's a waiver of your Fourth Amendment right
when you take the stand to impeachment.
Why couldn't we follow a similar reasoning
here, which is, you're compelled to -- I'm sorry.
Forget it.  I can answer my own question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Don't forget it.
Why don't you try a quick response?
(Laughter.)
MR. SCHMIDT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Justice Sotomayor, I think the -- the key
difference in Simmons and the reason its reasoning
shouldn't be applied here is that the distinction we've
been drawing from the start of this case is that what we
want is a rule of parity.  We want to be able to rebut
what the defendant himself put in issue in front of the
jury, and that's not Simmons.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
