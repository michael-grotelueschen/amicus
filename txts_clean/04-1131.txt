CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear argument
first today in Whitman versus Department of Transportation.
Ms. Karlan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. KARLAN: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The Government now concedes that the Ninth
Circuit erred in holding that the negotiated grievance
procedure of the Civil Service Reform Act strips
Federal courts of their jurisdiction to hear
constitutional claims by Federal employees.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We’re not bound by that
concession. If that’s a jurisdictional question,
doesn’t matter whether the Government conceded it or
not, does it?
MS. KARLAN: No. That’s correct, but the
Government correctly conceded perhaps I should have
said.
So I think that the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That’s a different question.
MS. KARLAN: Yes. So the question before the
Court is not whether, I think, Mr. Whitman can receive
constitutional judicial review, but rather, where and
how he is supposed to do so.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I still think it’s whether
because I don’t agree with the Government. Can I do
that?
MS. KARLAN: Of course, you can.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So that is the question. I
mean, the question is open whether there --
MS. KARLAN: Yes. I -- I think, obviously,
the Court has an obligation to satisfy itself of the
jurisdiction. But I’ll point out then that you would
have had that obligation as well in NTEU against Von
Raab in which this Court addressed precisely the same
kind of case, litigated in precisely the same posture.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it raised? Was that
objection, the jurisdictional question, raised in the
briefs and --
MS. KARLAN: It was raised in the district
court and the Government chose not to raise it in the
court of appeals or here. But, of course, you have, as
Justice Scalia said, an independent obligation to
satisfy yourself of your subject matter jurisdiction.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But our cases say that where
we don’t speak to a jurisdictional question, it is not
regarded as having been decided.
MS. KARLAN: No. I’m not saying that you
decided it in NTEU against Von Raab, Justice Scalia.
I’m just saying that given that you were apparently
satisfied with the theory, you should be satisfied here
too as well.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even if you assume
that Von Raab decided it, you have a quite different
situation here. The issue isn’t whether there will be
any judicial review. The issue is whether there will
be judicial review for the minor grievances, even if
they happen to involve a constitutional issue, that are
-- that are not -- for which judicial review was not
provided. Any major employee action -- judicial
review, as I understand it, is available, and it is
only relatively insignificant actions for which
judicial review is not available. Isn’t that right?
MS. KARLAN: No. With all respect, Justice
Scalia, I think that’s incorrect.
The Civil Service Reform Act provides for
judicial review of personnel actions, and if you go
back to the opinion for the Court that you wrote in
Fausto, you’ll see that you repeatedly referred to them
as personnel actions there.
Now, a warrantless search of a Government
employee, as this Court’s opinion in Bush against Lucas
says at note 28, is not a personnel action, and
therefore, there is no way of obtaining review of it
through the Civil Service Reform Act. But it is not in
any sense here a minor violation of Mr. Whitman’s
rights.
JUSTICE SCALIA: He could have refused -- he
could have refused the search, in which case if there
was any significant personnel action taken against him
for refusing it, he would have had judicial review of
whether the search was constitutional or not.
MS. KARLAN: Yes, Justice Scalia, but he
would have to bet the ranch to do it. And I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That’s often the case where
-- where, in -- in order to challenge a governmental
action, you -- you have to be willing to -- to go to
court by resisting it.
MS. KARLAN: Justice Scalia, I think that’s
incorrect when it comes to Government agency actions of
this kind. That’s what the Abbott Laboratories case
that we cite in our brief makes quite clear.
And I think last week, just last week, this
Court understood precisely that problem in talking
about the doctor who faces the abortion statute in
Ayotte. And several members of the Court pointed out
that to risk your license there or to risk, in this
case, a job that our client has held for 20 years in
order to challenge whether his Fourth Amendment rights
are violated is not normally how judicial review should
be accomplished.
And so the question here really is how
judicial review should be accomplished, and we’ve
maintained all along that the way judicial review
should be accomplished here is the way that it’s
accomplished in all sorts of cases, by bringing an
action in the Federal district court seeking injunctive
relief.
Now, what the Government --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though if -- if
-- do you concede that if he had, for example, refused
the testing and been fired and it was a major personnel
action, he would have to go through the statutory
procedures before bringing that -- the constitutional
claim on review of those administrative procedures?
MS. KARLAN: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn’t it seem
odd -- and this is sort of the logic of -- in Fausto
and some of the other cases -- that when you have a
major action, you have to exhaust before you can go
into court, but if you have something that doesn’t
qualify as a major adverse action, you get to go to
court right away?
MS. KARLAN: I can see why that might seem at
first a little strange to you, Your Honor. But the
point of the CSRA is to deal not with major versus
minor actions. It’s true that minor actions you get
administrative review and not judicial review, but
that’s about personnel actions. Mr. Whitman is not
challenging a personnel action here. He’s challenging
a warrantless search. The warrantless search was the
non-random, arbitrary urinalysis and breathalyzer to
which he was subjected.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that search was a
consequence of his employment. It -- this wasn’t a
search of a -- of a citizen who had no connection with
the Government. It was a search that he was required
to submit to as an employee. So to -- to describe it
as unrelated to employee action seems to me
unrealistic. The only reason he submitted to it was
that if he didn’t, he would have -- he would have been
subject to an employee action.
MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Scalia. He was
required, as a condition of his employment, to submit
to constitutional drug testing. And his allegation in
this case is that this drug test was unconstitutional
and --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it becomes
unconstitutional when -- when you have one more test?
What did it become unconstitutional? The first test
was not unconstitutional.
MS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. It became
unconstitutional when it became clear that at the
Anchorage air traffic control facility, they were not
complying with the requirements both of --
JUSTICE STEVENS: How many tests did he have?
MS. KARLAN: Well, he alleges in his
complaint that he was subjected to 13 tests, and then
when he complained --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Over what period of time?
MS. KARLAN: Over a period of time of
approximately 5 years in which other employees were
subjected to no more than one or two.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So it’s maybe three --
three a year? Is that what it was?
MS. KARLAN: Yes, but he was picked --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And that’s
unconstitutional?
MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Stevens. His
allegation is he was picked seven times in a row for
random drug testing.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, somebody will be if
it’s random. If you have thousands of people, somebody
will be if it is random. If there were nobody who was
picked seven times, that would show it wasn’t random.
So, you know --
MS. KARLAN: Right, and --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- whether he has a good
constitutional claim here I guess is rather doubtful --
MS. KARLAN: Well, he may well not. He may
well lose on his constitutional claim, Justice Breyer,
and that’s not the issue before this Court. The
question is whether a district judge should decide,
should listen to the facts and decide whether this was
random or not.
I tried once to calculate what are the
chances of --
JUSTICE BREYER: What are they? How many
people are there? How many people are tested if you
try to calculate it? How many --
MS. KARLAN: I -- I tried to do it and I
couldn’t do it.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- in the Federal
Government?
MS. KARLAN: Well, it wouldn’t --
JUSTICE BREYER: All you do is you get a bell
curve and you ask the Library of Congress and they’ll
do it --
MS. KARLAN: Well, right, but it would be --
I -- I know. You know, I -- it -- my calculator
doesn’t go that high.
JUSTICE BREYER: No. It’s -- it’s not hard
to do.
MS. KARLAN: But it’s high.
JUSTICE BREYER: But it’s not hard to do.
You just ask someone at Stanford. They’ll do it for
you.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the --
MS. KARLAN: It’s the undergraduates that
know how to do that.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Regardless, this
is beside the point.
I -- all right. Can I -- I just want you at
some point to get to not just the constitutional
question. Maybe he can go in and raise his claim. I
don’t know if he should have exhausted or not, et
cetera.
MS. KARLAN: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: But I find it hard, in
reading this, to believe the following. Like any other
worker, I mean, normally you have a collective
bargaining agreement, and the union takes up your minor
thing. And here, what you’re saying is although if
it’s a major thing, like a personnel action, there’s a
special thing where you get in -- you know, you -- you
get into court way down the road. It’s very
complicated. This individual, even though he
classifies it as a grievance where the union is
supposed to take it up and the union tells him we’re
not going to take it up, we don’t believe in your
claim, that then he can run in to a Federal judge.
Now, that -- that I find surprising, and I’d like you
to explain how in your theory that works.
MS. KARLAN: Yes, Justice Breyer. The
problem with assuming that a union will take a claim
like this to arbitration is the following. Unions
generally do not take individual employee grievances to
arbitration, especially if you look at this collective
bargaining agreement, which requires the union to pay
the costs if they lose.
Now, on a claim like this, for the very
reason that you suggested earlier, it may be difficult
to figure out what the facts are.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position,
Ms. Karlan, was that he doesn’t even have to ask the
union. Justice Breyer is presenting a scenario where
he asks the union and the union says we’ve got better
things to do with our money.
MS. KARLAN: That’s right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I think your position
is he doesn’t have to ask at all. He can go directly
into Federal court under 1331.
MS. KARLAN: That’s correct. Just as, for
example, the employees did in the NFFE against
Weinberger case on which you sat in the court of
appeals where the Government again there tried to argue
there was no subject matter jurisdiction, and the court
really gave that argument the back of its hand because
traditionally the way that someone who wants to allege,
someone who is an employee or not who wants to allege,
that there -- that he’s seeking injunctive relief for a
constitutional violation, goes to the Federal district
courts under 28 U.S.C. 1331, not to a negotiated
grievance procedure that was not intended and cannot
operate in the way that the Government seems to hope --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why -- why can’t he?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? Because my --
when I first looked at this, I thought, well, this is
the kind of thing that should have been -- should have
been resolved at the grievance level, it shouldn’t have
even have to get to arbitration if he’s right. He
wants a survey to see if he’s being picked on. If he
is, there would be redress. So it seemed like this was
the kind of complaint that was best handled in that
kind of procedure.
MS. KARLAN: Well, I have two somewhat
different answers to your question, Justice Ginsburg.
One, which I’ll turn to in a moment, is about the
specifics of this case, but I want to give the more
general one first. And that is, that the negotiated
grievance procedures that unions set up are for the
benefit of employees who believe that that is the best
way of seeking to resolve their complaints, and most
complaints, quite honestly, will be done that way.
Most people are not going to go into Federal court,
especially not if all they can seek is injunctive
relief and they have to pay a filing fee and it’s going
to take a long time to go there.
Now, Mr. Whitman had two problems that made
it unlikely he was going to go through the grievance
process here. The first of these problems is that the
grievance process, as it sets -- as it’s set out in the
joint appendix, the two stages of which he has control
-- and I can return in a moment to what happens after
that. But the two stages at which he has control are
to talk to his supervisor and to talk to the facility
manager.
When it comes to drug testing of the kind to
which Mr. Whitman was subjected here, his supervisor
does not have authority over that. It’s done from
outside the facility. So talking to his supervisor
will not get him anywhere.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but that simply means
that the grievance procedure is more valuable in this
case than merely talking to his supervisor. And -- and
the -- the issue -- maybe -- maybe we’re missing it,
but the issue is why isn’t there a very good reason to
require him to go through the grievance procedure,
number one, to -- to cut down on needless Federal court
actions and, number two, under the -- sort of the
general policy of favoring what collective bargaining
agreements negotiate.
MS. KARLAN: Well, if his union had
negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that
required exhaustion, then it would be appropriate to
make him go through it, but they didn’t do that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but -- no -- no
question. That would be an easier case. But why
shouldn’t we require an exhaustion for those two
reasons and maybe others?
MS. KARLAN: Well, if I could go through the
grievance process, I think you’ll see why this
grievance process cannot be turned into an exhaustion
process without this Court, in words that Justice
Ginsburg used last week, inserting a lot of carets into
the statute.
That is, there are two stages of this
grievance process over which Mr. Whitman has control.
He can go to his -- his supervisor in an informal
conversation. There will be no factfinding. There is
no right to call witnesses. There is no right to
present evidence.
If he doesn’t like that -- and he has only 15
days to do it -- he can then appeal to the -- to the
supervisor of the facility. Again, he has no right to
present evidence. He has no right to any kind of
factfinding. He has no right to a reasoned decision.
Those are the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: He may not have any right to
it, but in fact, he may get some relief.
MS. KARLAN: Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER: The union may say, okay,
we’re going to take this one up.
MS. KARLAN: They may and I’ll turn to that
in just a moment, but let me add one more thing to the
answer I was giving a moment ago to Justice Ginsburg,
which is one of the problems here is that our client
alleges in his supplemental complaint that when he
first complained about this, he was singled out yet
again for retaliatory testing. And so this is
precisely the kind of case in which someone who is
being subjected repeatedly to retaliatory tests would
be worried.
Now let me turn to the question of --
JUSTICE O’CONNOR: Well, Ms. Karlan, let me
put one other element in here. Was -- was your client
specifically told by the FLRA to bring a grievance
under the collective bargaining agreement?
MS. KARLAN: He was -- he wasn’t told. He
was advised by someone who said the FLRA has no
jurisdiction here because this isn’t an unfair labor
practice. Now, of course, what the Government wants
him to do is to exhaust by going back to the FLRA which
has already told him that it has no expertise on this
matter.
So let me turn to that third stage of the
grievance process now, which is now he invokes
arbitration, or at least he asks his union to because
under section 7121(b)(1)(C)(iii) of the statute, only
the union can invoke arbitration. Now, this Court
noted, as long ago as Vaca against Sipes, that unions
invoke arbitration in only a minuscule handful of
cases, so that in Vaca against Sipes, it was 1 out of
0.
There was a recent study, the most recent
study I could find that was published, about Federal
Government employees, dealt with civilian employees of
the Army, and it looked at how often did the 31
different unions that represent civilian employees of
the Army actually invoke arbitration vis-a-vis the
number of grievances that were filed. And it found
that in the years it looked at, no more than 6 percent
got arbitration.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why isn’t the thing to
do here -- I -- I see that you are raising a
significant question in respect to -- at least in my
view, in respect to the -- an action that violates a
regulation that violates a statute. Leave the
Constitution aside, but it might violate a number of
practices, good practices, et cetera. But why isn’t
focusing on that the thing for the plaintiff here to do
is he goes to the union -- I’m just reading from page 6
and 7 of your brief -- and he says, I would like you to
invoke arbitration? And they might do it. Now, if
they do it and it comes out a way they don’t like,
he then -- they might file exceptions and they might
win.
But what you’re worried about is if they
don’t win or if they don’t do it, they can go to court
only if it involved an unfair labor practice or a major
adverse personnel action. That’s what’s worrying you,
I take it.
MS. KARLAN: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why isn’t it, at that
stage if he doesn’t get into court, you then say that
that isn’t true? They should be able to come to court
in other instances as well, making the same kinds of
arguments that you’re making now.
MS. KARLAN: Well, there are two reasons for
that I think.
One is he suffers an irreparable bet-the-farm
injury every time he’s searched unconstitutionally.
The second is that the statute simply doesn’t
say that. I can understand -- honestly, I can -- why
this Court is in favor of exhaustion requirements. And
if the statute contained one, it would be eminently
sensible for you to apply it.
JUSTICE BREYER: You -- you -- I -- I believe
that there are millions of instances, perhaps. Now,
I’m -- when I think something like this, I’m quite
often wrong. But I thought that the reason that
exhaustion is required is not always because statutes
require it. It’s partly because of the word final in
the APA, which applies here as well, and it’s also
because of the common law of administrative law that
requires people to exhaust their remedies.
MS. KARLAN: Absolutely, and I think if you
used this Court’s opinion in Madigan against McCarthy
as your template for thinking about whether to impose
an exhaustion requirement here, because I think, quite
frankly, that’s what you would be doing -- you would be
imposing one that doesn’t exist now.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but the -- the --
MS. KARLAN: The Court --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the whole right to -- to
go into court with a constitutional claim is absent
from the statute. And -- and so we may as well get
hung for a sheep as a lamb. If -- if we’re going to
recognize the one, I don’t see that we’re going too
much further in -- in saying it’s got to be conditional
on the other.
MS. KARLAN: I -- I don’t think so, Justice
Souter, because I think this Court has traditionally
allowed individuals who are bringing constitutional
claims for injunctive relief to seek that relief.
Nothing in the CSRA changed that, and if I can explain
why for just a moment, I think it’ll be helpful.
If you look at this Court’s opinion in Fausto
or you look at this Court’s opinion in Bush against
Lucas or the opinion in Karahalios, which I think are
the three leading cases from this Court construing the
Civil Service Reform Act in -- in this kind of fashion,
you’ll notice that they repeatedly refer to those
acts as being comprehensive with regard to personnel
actions.
Personnel actions is not a casual phrase. It
is a defined term in the CSRA. It’s defined in section
02(a), which is -- was discussed in the Government’s
brief at page 5, note 5. And you will notice there, if
you read it, that they do include -- indeed, Congress
in 1994 amended the statute to add to the list of
personnel actions orders for psychiatric testing.
There was nothing here that turns a drug test into a
personnel action.
Now, the CSRA is absolutely comprehensive in
its field, but its field is personnel actions. And
this case is not a personnel action.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the grievance procedure
covers it, and you took pains to point out to us that
when you go to the grievance procedure, you’re not
necessarily entitled to findings and -- and written
conclusions, et cetera. But there’s a reason for that.
The reason for that is that these things can be very,
very minor. So now you’re saying that just because of
-- the grievance procedure doesn’t entitle you
necessarily to findings, et cetera, that you can go
into court. But the only reason you don’t get those
findings is because we know, going in, that they’re so
minor. So now the most minor things go to court. That
seems very anomalous.
MS. KARLAN: Justice Kennedy, all sorts of
personnel actions might be minor and they might be the
kind of thing that the CSRA wants to have decided
administratively only or through exhaustion. This is a
Fourth Amendment violation. It is not minor. As this
Court held in Von Raab, the only thing that makes this
kind of test constitutional --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I have to interrupt you.
What is the Fourth Amendment violation?
MS. KARLAN: The Fourth Amendment violation
here is this Court said that warrantless, suspicionless
drug testing of Federal employees is acceptable only if
it has safeguards that ensure that there is no
discretion exercised in the field and that it’s truly
random.
JUSTICE STEVENS: As I understand, the
allegations are that there was random procedure in
effect, and he thinks maybe he’s been tested more
frequently than some other people. That’s all.
MS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. He alleges that
they are not, in fact, following the random procedures,
that instead, when it’s more convenient for them to
test him -- and I can understand why they want to test
him. Every time they test him he passes the test. So
why not ask Mr. Whitman who is a compliant, sober
employee, if you need another person to just round out
the numbers to --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but as I understand
it, the -- the system as a whole is not challenged as
violating the Fourth Amendment.
MS. KARLAN: No. The operation of the
system, as it applies to Mr. Whitman in Anchorage.
JUSTICE STEVENS: By having him take more
tests than would be produced by a purely random
selection.
MS. KARLAN: That’s correct. And then by
retaliating --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Have we ever said that’s a
Fourth Amendment violation?
MS. KARLAN: Of course it is, because you
can’t conduct a random --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If the computer
malfunctions, that’s a Fourth Amendment violation?
MS. KARLAN: No. And if the Government --
the Government in its answer in the district court does
not say there was a computer malfunction. They say we
don’t really even keep records back as long as he --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the relief that he
requested was to do a little more testing to see
whether he was being tested more than the average
person, as I understand it.
MS. KARLAN: Well -- well, yes. Of course,
he was proceeding pro se in the district court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is not -- did not
seem to me to be alleging a violation of the Fourth
Amendment.
MS. KARLAN: No. He -- he did. He said it
is not random, and then in his supplemental complaint,
he alleged that he was retaliated against for
complaining the first time around and was selected out
when he wasn’t on the list to be tested yet again.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. Karlan, if this
is indeed serious, are you sure that it’s not a
personnel action?
MS. KARLAN: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There is a residual category
in the definition of personnel action which says, any
other significant change in duties, responsibilities,
or working conditions. That’s the residual category.
But one of the specifically named categories,
before you get to that, is a decision to order
psychiatric testing. Now, if that kind of a decision
could be a personnel action, why couldn’t a decision to
conduct -- to conduct a drug test be considered a
personnel action?
MS. KARLAN: Well, two answers to that. One
is the fact that Congress -- in 1978 they first gave
the entire list of personnel actions. In 1994, they
amended that list to add psychiatric testing. This is
after the Government has already been engaged in urine
testing of Federal employees. If they wanted to say
drug testing, they would have said it. And for you to
add that is really --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I’m not adding it. There’s
a residual category at the end: or any other
significant change in duties, responsibilities, or
working conditions. I consider this -- you consider it
a significant change in working conditions.
MS. KARLAN: With all respect --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And he thought he didn’t
have to undergo drug testing, and what do you know?
He’s being picked on for drug testing all the time.
MS. KARLAN: Well, with all respect, Your
Honor, I think you would have to overrule the Fort
Stewart School against FLRA case that the Court decided
in 1990 to define working conditions to include a drug
test because there -- and it’s cited at page 28 of the
NTEU’s brief -- the Court says that the term, working
conditions, refers to, quote, circumstances or states
of affairs attendant to one’s performance of a job.
Now, drug testing is not attendant to his
performance of his job. It is the condition of his
holding the job in some sense that he pass the test.
And if he failed that test, he would, indeed, have to
go through the CSRA. But because he passed the test,
he has no way of getting into court.
Now, if I could turn --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why then would a decision to
order psychiatric testing qualify? Because it says, or
any other. Right?
MS. KARLAN: That’s --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Significant change in
duties, responsibilities, or working conditions. The
implication is that a decision to order psychiatric
testing is a significant change in duties,
responsibilities, or -- or working conditions.
MS. KARLAN: But if the -- but if Congress,
Justice Scalia, had thought that that catchall phrase
covered psychiatric tests, it would not have amended
the statute in 1994 to add them specifically.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It’s always good to be safe.
MS. KARLAN: Well, yes, and it’s good for the
FAA to comply with the Constitution. And that’s why we
think he should be allowed to go to Federal court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. -- Ms. Karlan,
you have a -- a statutory claim that essentially
mirrors the constitutional claim. The statute requires
the testing to be random and impartial. If we think
there’s a difference between the constitutional claims
and statutory claims with respect to their treatment
under the CSRA, how do you handle that? Does he have
to exhaust the statutory claim but not the
constitutional one?
MS. KARLAN: I don’t think that there would
be a difference with respect to exhaustion on those two
claims. The Government simply says he can never get
review of the statutory claim. So I don’t think anyone
here is arguing that there should be a differential
treatment with respect to exhaustion. It’s with
respect to whether you can get into court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you -- you agree with
the Government on that, that he can never get review of
the statutory claim.
MS. KARLAN: Oh, no.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, well.
MS. KARLAN: We spend rather a bit of time in
our brief explaining --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, don’t -- don’t appeal
to them on a -- on a point on which you don’t agree
with them. I mean --
MS. KARLAN: What can I -- what can I say?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I still don’t
understand how they proceed. Does he have to bring --
can he go right into court on the constitutional claim
even if the statutory claim has to go through the
grievance procedure?
MS. KARLAN: The answer to that would be yes.
He might end up being precluded, if he lost in Federal
court on the constitutional claim, from coming back on
the statutory claim.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the identical
claims have to proceed under two different routes.
MS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. We don’t think
there is exhaustion required with respect to either set
of claims.
If I may, I’ll reserve the balance of my
time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Stewart.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Although Congress has not clearly expressed
an intent to foreclose all judicial review of
petitioner’s constitutional claim, such review should
be conducted in a manner that is as consistent as
possible with the text and structure of the CSRA.
Because petitioner failed to invoke the grievance
procedures of the applicable collective bargaining
agreement, his suit was properly dismissed.
And if I may, just in a -- a moment or two,
summarize the Government’s position as to the steps
that an individual in petitioner’s position would have
to take in order to obtain judicial review of a
constitutional claim like this one.
First, the employee must make all reasonable
efforts to utilize the available administrative
remedies under the CSRA itself, including any
applicable collective bargaining agreement. So in this
instance, the first two steps of the grievance process,
talking to the immediate supervisor and then to the
facility manager, would have been within petitioner’s
control. And if those steps had proven unavailing,
petitioner should have requested that the union take
the case to arbitration, and then, if necessary, to the
FLRA.
Second, if at the end of the administrative
process an avenue of judicial review is available under
the CSRA itself, the employee must seek relief pursuant
to that provision.
And I think petitioner really concedes that
point to be true; that is, if petitioner were raising a
constitutional challenge to a major adverse action,
such as dismissal, petitioner concedes not only that he
would have been required to exhaust administrative
remedies by -- by appealing to the Merit Systems
Protection Board, but petitioner also concedes that we
-- he would have had to seek judicial review in the
manner specified by the CSRA, that is, by filing a
petition for review of the MSPB’s decision in the
Federal Circuit, rather than proceeding directly to
district court.
And finally, our position is that if at the
conclusion of the administrative process, judicial
review is unavailable under the CSRA, the employee may
then obtain review of his constitutional challenge
alone in district court, pursuant to the Administrative
Procedure -- Procedure Act.
Now, in some sense, there is an element of
untidiness in our position because what we’re trying to
do is reconcile Congress’ intent to adopt --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, can I just ask
one question? Because I didn’t quite follow it. I
thought you were describing a major personnel action in
-- in your description of the administrative review.
But if this is a minor or whatever, a lesser review,
would there have been an avenue through the
administrative agency?
MR. STEWART: There would have been, at least
for this employee, by virtue of the fact that he was
covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Through the collective
bargaining --
MR. STEWART: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But then supposing the
union is unwilling to grieve or take it up or he fails,
then what happens?
MR. STEWART: If -- if he requests that the
union take the grievance to arbitration and then to the
FLRA and the union refuses, our position would be that
he could then file suit in Federal district court under
the Administrative Procedure Act on his constitutional
challenge alone. That is, we think on the one --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And it would be in the
district court.
MR. STEWART: That would be in the district
court --
JUSTICE O’CONNOR: Now, that is if -- if the
union doesn’t agree to arbitration?
MR. STEWART: That is if the union does not
agree to take the case to arbitration and then to the
FLRA. If --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your difference --
what’s separating you and Whitman, it seems, is a
question of timing. The action that you’re describing
that would come at the end, after he’s used the
administrative process, is the same one that he is
seeking to bring at the front end. That is, it’s a
31 action --
MR. STEWART: I think --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and -- and it’s based
on the Government’s waiver of sovereign immunity for
nonmonetary claims.
MR. STEWART: It is in part one of timing,
but it’s not one of timing alone. That is, our
--
position is if Mr. Whitman had been successful in
prevailing upon the union to take the case to
arbitration and then to the FLRA, the position we’ve
taken in the brief is that judicial review, if the FLRA
had rendered an unfavorable decision, would most
appropriately be accomplished in the court of appeals
pursuant to the CSRA.
But our position is if the union is unwilling
to take the grievance to the point where the ruling can
be reviewed under the provisions of the CSRA itself,
that the APA remains available as a fallback.
But the -- the fact that it’s one of timing
doesn’t make it an insignificant difference. That is
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, you know, you
have here a statute in which Congress, with malice
aforethought, very clearly provides for judicial review
of any major personnel actions and does not provide for
judicial review of what it had regarded as
insignificant personnel actions. I can understand the
position, although I don’t agree with it, that the
constitutional provision which says Congress can -- can
make exceptions to the jurisdiction of the Federal
courts should not be interpreted to exclude significant
constitutional claims. But when Congress has gone to
the trouble of providing for judicial review of any
claims that are significant and just saying any other
insignificant action, even though a constitutional
violation is alleged in connection with it, if in fact
it does not harm you that much, we’re not going to
allow judicial review, what is -- what is wrong with
that? It seems to me that’s what Congress has said and
-- and you’re creating a scheme that simply contradicts
what Congress plainly said.
MR. STEWART: I mean, first, certainly if
Congress had said with absolute clarity that district
court review of claims like this is precluded, we would
defend the statute as constitutional.
Second, I agree with you that the fairest
reading, the most likely interpretation of Congress’
intent is that claims of this nature -- that is,
complaints about aspects of the employment relationship
that don’t rise to the level of personnel actions. The
fairest reading of Congress’ intent is that such suits
would be precluded.
However, this Court in a number of prior
decisions has required something more than that before
inferring that Congress has barred all judicial review
of a colorable constitutional claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Did any of them involve a
--
--
situation in which Congress took the pain to separate
significant actions from insignificant actions?
MR. STEWART: I mean, in some sense the CSRA
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, some of them involve
deportation and, you know, major -- major actions.
This is a case where Congress has -- has carefully
tried to say these are major actions for which you
should be able to get into the courts. And these other
things -- you -- you have these administrative
remedies, but that’s the end of it.
MR. STEWART: But I -- I think the flip side
of it is that some of those cases involved statutes
that appeared on their face to function as express
preclusions of judicial review. Here, we don’t have
that. Here, the argument as to why Administrative
Procedure Act review is precluded is not based on the
text of any CSRA provision standing alone. It’s based
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I’m -- I’m not sure
what the congressional intent would be to bifurcate the
constitutional and the statutory claims, especially if
they’re the same thing.
MR. STEWART: I don’t know that there was
necessarily an intent to bifurcate, but I think we had
the same --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that’s what -- that’s
what you’re asking us to say.
MR. STEWART: I think the Court had the same
situation in Webster v. Doe. That is, in Webster v.
Doe, the Court concluded that given the limits on
review of the CIA director’s employment decisions and
given the great sensitivity of hiring and firing
matters within that agency, the Court concluded that
there was simply no law to apply in review of the --
the claimant’s complaint under the Administrative
Procedure Act. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that
judicial review of the constitutional challenge
remained available.
And the idea was not so much that Congress
itself had manifested an intent to differentiate
between the two types of claims. It was that Congress
had treated the two types of claims the same but that
the type of evidence that will suffice to eliminate
judicial review of a non-constitutional claim is --
it’s less demanding than the type that the Court would
require before eliminating judicial review of a
constitutional claim.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if -- if -- under --
under your explanation of how the system works, you go
to district court with a constitutional claim. He’s --
he -- the district court doesn’t have to reach the
statutory claim first?
MR. STEWART: No. The statutory claim
wouldn’t be before the district court. Again, if -- if
the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that’s what I mean.
This is a very odd system where you have to immediately
go to the constitutional claim and you’re foreclosed
from looking at the statutory claim.
MR. STEWART: I -- I agree that it’s an
unusual system, but I think it -- and in a sense the
same situation would have been present in Webster v.
Doe, that is, the Court, when it came to review the
merits of the constitutional challenge, wouldn’t have
had any possibility of deciding the case on a non-
constitutional basis because non-constitutional
challenges would be foreclosed.
Now --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position on
the statute was that it doesn’t afford a right of
action, that it was just an instruction to the
Secretary. Maybe I misread your position on the
statute. We’re talking about 45-1048?
MR. STEWART: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the
Government’s position was there’s no right of action
under that statute.
MR. STEWART: There’s no private right of
action conferred by 45-108 itself. Now, in the
ordinary case, when a Federal statute places limits on
agency personnel and a particular category of
plaintiffs falls within the zone of interest that was
intended to be protected by that provision, then even
if the statute that limits agency discretion itself
doesn’t provide a private right of action, the
Administrative Procedure Act would entitle a claimant
to get into court and argue that the agency’s decision
was contrary to law, namely the relevant statute. So
if there were no question of CSRA conclusion, we would
agree that the claimant could go into court raising a
statutory challenge notwithstanding the absence of a
private right of action in 45-108 itself.
Here, we think that the evidence from the
comprehensive congressional scheme is sufficient to
divest the courts of jurisdiction over the statutory
claim. We don’t think that Congress has spoken with
the clarity that this Court has required to divest the
courts of jurisdiction over the constitutional
challenge.
JUSTICE O’CONNOR: Now, as to that, if -- if
there were a petitioner with some constitutional claim
-- let’s not get into the debate about significant or
non-significant -- covered by the collective
bargaining agreement, you say the petitioner can’t go
to court with the constitutional claim unless he first
persuades the union to seek arbitration.
MR. STEWART: No. We’re saying that he first
has to attempt to persuade the union to seek
arbitration. That is, he has to make all reasonable
efforts to utilize the full range of administrative
remedies. But it -- our -- our position is if the
union declines that request, then judicial review would
be available at the end of the day in Federal district
court.
JUSTICE O’CONNOR: All right. Now, did you
raise the exhaustion claim? Did the Government raise
it in the lower courts?
MR. STEWART: We didn’t characterize it as an
exhaustion argument. That is, the district court
alluded to the petitioner’s failure to exhaust in
dismissing the suit. However, we -- this is not a case
in which we have, up to this point, litigated the
merits of the Fourth Amendment dispute and then
switched to a threshold objection to adjudication.
We’ve always argued that the suit was barred by the
CSRA scheme, and we’ve always pointed out that the
petitioner did not take advantage of the administrative
remedies that were available to him.
Really, the only change in our position is
that we have been in the -- in this Court have been
willing to acknowledge that in the hypothetical case
where someone in petitioner’s position did make -- take
full advantage or make reasonable efforts to take full
advantage of the administrative processes, that
judicial review would be available.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I guess
you’re saying, as to the constitutional claim, it’s
obvious they have to exhaust.
There’s no reason why they don’t have to
exhaust in respect to the 12th test, which has already
occurred, and in respect to the 15th, which might be
threatened, if it does come about that it’s threatened,
they can go in, I guess, under 705 of the APA and ask
for an injunction. Any reason they couldn’t do that?
MR. STEWART: Well, they would first have to
get into court first. They would first --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. What they do is
they follow, like any other agency action. An agency
action has taken place. I think it’s unconstitutional
or you do. We exhaust our remedies and then get to
court at the end of the day and make our claim.
An agency action is threatened. I am
threatened with irreparable injury. I can go to court,
I think, at the time it’s threatened, and say I want a
protective order. I think 705 provides for that
specifically. And -- and, therefore, I’m protected. I
can’t imagine why they couldn’t do that if they have a
-- not just a plausible, but a -- a good claim that it
does violate the Constitution and they need the
protection. Is there any reason they couldn’t?
MR. STEWART: I -- I mean, again with the
caveat they would first have to avail themselves of the
administrative --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, they wouldn’t. Their
point is that the very -- availing myself of the
administrative remedy will work irreparable harm of --
in violation of my constitutional right. Now, maybe
that’s not true, but let’s imagine it’s true. Then
couldn’t they go in and ask for a protective order? I
thought that you could do that, but I might be wrong.
MR. STEWART: I mean, I think you’re --
you’re correct that you could do that in the general
run of cases under the administrative --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And is there any
--
reason that they shouldn’t be able to do that here?
Because they are going to say that -- I don’t know they
ever can make it out in this case, but they are going
to say that my having to go ahead with the number --
test number 15, which, by the way, may never be
threatened, but if it is, it will, the very fact that I
have to do it, violate an important constitutional
right that I need to have protected before undergoing
the text -- the test.
MR. STEWART: No. In -- in our view, in
harmonizing the -- the principle that judicial review
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. STEWART: -- will ordinarily be available
for a constitutional claim with the remedial scheme
established by the CSRA --
JUSTICE BREYER: You think they could not do
that under 705. So there is a difference between you
on that.
As to the statutory claim, I mean, I find --
but others may disagree with this. It’s my personal
view that the notion of private right of action in this
area simply mixes things up. It’s apples and oranges.
It has nothing to do with anything. That if a person,
in fact, is adversely affected or aggrieved by a
Government action, he usually, almost always, indeed,
can get judicial review eventually. But what you’re
saying there I take it is that may be so, but this
impliedly says no.
MR. STEWART: That’s correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, my question is do we
have to decide that. Because, after all, this
individual may get relief through the statutory
procedures that you admit are provided by asking for
grievance arbitration. He may, the first time he asks
for it, be given a piece of paper that shows him he
wasn’t hurt. Or he may have been hurt, and they’ll say
we don’t it again. There are a lot of things that can
happen.
Do we have to decide the issue today of
whether if he goes to the union, the union says we
won’t arbitrate, or they say we will and they lose and
it isn’t as an unfair labor practice -- do we have to
decide that issue as to whether a person in those
circumstances can then subsequently go into court?
MR. STEWART: No. I think you could
certainly decide the case on the ground that an
individual who has made no effort to utilize the
grievance procedures that are available under the
collective bargaining agreement, can’t bypass those
procedures entirely by filing suit into -- in Federal
district court. And it wouldn’t be necessary for the
Court to resolve --
JUSTICE BREYER: So we have to say the easier
matter is it’s clear that as to such matters, you must
exhaust. It’s so clear that there is no reason for us
to decide whether there is an implied repeal of the
right at the end of some days to -- to judicial review,
a matter which is disfavored in the law.
MR. STEWART: Well, certainly to -- I mean,
that is, justifiably to impose an exhaustion
requirement, the Court would have to find that the --
the exhaustion principle is in some sense implicit in
the CSRA.
JUSTICE BREYER: I might. My -- so I don’t
know why it wouldn’t be.
MR. STEWART: And I think that there’s ample
basis for the Court to do that -- that is, one of the
noteworthy features of the CSRA is that the act
authorizes judicial review of a wide category of
Government actions in different courts under different
circumstances. But there’s no provision of the CSRA
that ever gives a plaintiff a right of immediate access
to a Federal district court. That is --
JUSTICE O’CONNOR: Well, is -- is -- should
--
it be a little bit of a concern to us that the lower
court didn’t address it? Should it be sent back to
look at this exhaustion notion?
MR. STEWART: I mean, I think it’s clear --
it -- it is clear and undisputed that the plaintiff was
advised by the FLRA that the grievance procedure was
his available remedy and declined to invoke even the
initial step of the grievance procedure, and therefore
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was on the view
that it was an exclusive remedy. The -- the statute is
not written in -- in any way as an exhaustion
requirement. It says you’ve got a minor grievance --
issue. You go through the grievance procedure. There
is no judicial review at the end of the line. So you
would be converting something that Congress wrote to be
an exclusive remedy into an exhaustion requirement.
MR. STEWART: But I think -- I think that’s
why I said earlier that there was some element of
untidiness to our position. That is, we’re not
contending that this was precisely the scheme that
Congress envisioned.
But our -- our -- the Court’s task, I
believe, is to reconcile Congress’ apparent intent --
attempt to construct a comprehensive scheme that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you -- you have picked
one way to do that. You say go through the grievance
procedure. If there’s a constitutional question
remaining, if you haven’t been satisfied, then you
bring the action in court.
Another way to say is, well, as long as we’re
making this up, why not allow the -- the action to
proceed at once in court, but then the court to say,
I’m going to abstain while you go through the grievance
procedure.
MR. STEWART: I -- I mean, I guess we would --
we would resist the notion that we’re making it all up.
That is, whenever Congress -- whenever this Court
attempts to harmonize two distinct statutes to make
them -- in order that they would make sense taken
together, the result is likely to be that neither
statute will be read in precisely --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What’s the second statute?
There’s no second statute here. There -- there is your
concession of the fact that there has to be judicial
review. That’s what’s driving all of this. And -- and
generally speaking, when we find something to be
unconstitutional, we don’t rewrite a statute so that it
will be constitutional. We just say, you know, there
--
has to be judicial review.
MR. STEWART: There is a -- a second statute,
and it’s the Administrative Procedure Act, which would
generally allow an individual who is aggrieved by
Federal Government action to file suit in court. And
the question is whether Congress has manifested with
sufficient clarity its intent to divest the court of
jurisdiction under the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, if you assume
the APA is the remedy -- we’re talking about a district
court procedure -- how would you describe the final
agency action that would be challenged in that lawsuit?
MR. STEWART: I mean, it really depends upon
the extent to which -- it really depends on where the
administrative procedures go. That is, the APA is --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Let’s assume that the -- he
seeks a grievance, and the union refuses to grieve.
And then he then goes into -- into district court under
the APA. What would the final agency action be in your
view?
MR. STEWART: The final -- it’s -- it’s a
little bit hard to define. It would in some sense be
JUSTICE STEVENS: Very hard to define.
MR. STEWART: It -- it would in some sense be
--
the allegedly unconstitutional drug test that he’s
already been required to take.
One of the things that makes this --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So what would his relief
be? He can untake it.
MR. STEWART: Exactly. And one -- one of the
JUSTICE STEVENS: Because he can’t damages
under the APA.
MR. STEWART: One of the things that makes
this tricky is that under this Court’s decision of City
of Los Angeles v. Lyons, if an individual is subjected
to allegedly unconstitutional conduct but has no reason
to believe that it will happen to him again and damages
are unavailable, then the -- there is no standing to
seek injunctive --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but here, that’s
not this case because he said, and when I complained,
they did it again.
MR. STEWART: That’s right. And I think in a
sense what you could say is the -- the agency action
that he would be complaining about in the APA suit is
not so much the past drug test, it would be the
threatened or ostensibly threatened drug test. And his
basis for believing that they were, in fact, likely to
occur is that he had been subjected to unconstitutional
drug tests in the past.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But that’s not a final
agency action. The threat of another test isn’t a
final agency action, is it?
MR. STEWART: I would certainly think that if
-- if there were no question of CSRA preclusion, if we
were just looking at the APA standing alone, and an
individual said they’ve done this unconstitutional
thing to me time after time, my supervisor has
ransacked my office time and again or FBI agents have
shown up at my door every day and have insisted on
searching, I think even if damages were unavailable for
the prior unlawful actions, at some point we would say
the likelihood of repetition is sufficiently imminent
that a right of action should be available in court.
And -- but again, I think all of these are
perhaps potential alternative bases on which this
complaint could have been dismissed, but it doesn’t
alter the fact that an adequate basis for dismissal was
the failure to invoke the grievance procedures
available under the CSRA and the collective bargaining
agreement.
And I think it’s not simply a -- to say that
it’s simply a question of when the individual can file
suit is to presuppose that the grievance procedures
won’t work. And there’s no reason to assume that that
will happen. That is, Congress manifested -- Congress
in the CSRA enacted congressional findings to the
effect that collective bargaining and -- and union
activity in the public sector are in the public
interest. It specifically required that collective
bargaining agreements under the CSRA should contain
grievance procedures for the resolution of disputes,
and I think --
JUSTICE O’CONNOR: If the dispute were to go
to arbitration -- there are very limited provisions for
judicial review in the event there is a decision --
could the constitutional claim still go to court?
MR. STEWART: The constitutional claim could
go to court, and what -- what we’ve sketched out in the
brief is two alternative routes for judicial review in
the event that the grievance was processed to its
conclusion, that is, a finding by the FLRA.
On the one hand, it would be possible to
invoke the provision of the CSRA that specifically
refers to judicial review of FLRA decisions generally,
and that provides for review either in the regional
courts of appeals or in the D.C. Circuit.
However, it -- there is a difficulty with the
statutory language in the sense that that provision
that authorizes court of appeals review specifically
excludes FLRA decisions on grievances. And therefore,
if the Court felt like that sort of tweaking of the
statutory language was just too much to tolerate, then
the available remedy would be in the Federal district
court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right that the
statute as written says you don’t have any judicial
review for these kinds of actions? You go through the
grievance procedure, win or lose. That’s it. There is
no judicial review.
MR. STEWART: It doesn’t say you have no
judicial review. It -- the -- the provision that would
otherwise authorize judicial review in the courts of
appeals of FLRA actions is made inapplicable to
grievance procedures.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The statute does not
provide for judicial review --
MR. STEWART: Exactly, but the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as it does in the case
of major actions.
MR. STEWART: But the statute -- the CSRA
does not say -- does not purport to divest the courts
of the authority that they would otherwise have under
different statutes to adjudicate challenges to
employment decisions. Now --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, if -- if we’re
going to tweak the statute, isn’t the least possible
tweak -- and perhaps not a tweak at all -- simply to
consider this a personnel action?
MR. STEWART: If the Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if a decision to order
psychiatric testing can be one, why can’t a decision to
require drug testing be one?
MR. STEWART: That -- that would be a
possible tweak. I’m not sure if it would --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I’m not sure it’s a tweak at
all. It -- it just depends on -- on what you consider
to be working conditions. And in -- in many contexts,
we’ve given the broadest possible interpretation to
working conditions.
MR. STEWART: I think that would be a basis
for dismissal in this case. I was going to say I’m not
sure whether that would solve the problem from
petitioner’s standpoint because --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it would mean
you don’t get into court at all then. Right?
MR. STEWART: It would -- the -- the remedy
for a -- an alleged prohibited personnel practice --
and, I think, an unconstitutional personnel action
would be a prohibited personnel practice under the
statute. The remedy for that is to complain to the
Office of Special Counsel. Now, if the Office of
Special Counsel seeks corrective action with the Merit
Systems Protection Board and the MSPB issues a decision
unfavorable to the employee, then the employee, under
the terms of the CSRA itself, can seek judicial review
of the MSPB’s decision in the Federal Circuit. So
there would be a potential route --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even in the -- even
if it’s not a major personnel action?
MR. STEWART: Yes, if -- again, if the OSC
asked for a corrective action in the MSPB. Now, if the
OSC processes the complaint and concludes either that
the factual allegations are unsubstantiated or that the
allegations, even if true, wouldn’t constitute a
prohibited personnel practice and terminates the
investigation on that basis, there’s no avenue for
judicial review under the terms of the CSRA of the --
the OSC’s decision to dismiss the complaint. So I
think that the -- the route you’ve sketched out might,
at the end of the day, lead to judicial review without
any tweaking of the statute. But if the OSC dismissed
the complaint, we would still be left with the problem
--
of --
JUSTICE BREYER: What their brief says is
that they can go on a personnel, as opposed to major
personnel, to the OSC if, and only if, the complaint
has to do with whistleblowing.
MR. STEWART: That’s correct. And that --
that’s --
JUSTICE BREYER: And this doesn’t have to do
with whistleblowing.
MR. STEWART: That -- that’s correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: And therefore, even if this
were a personnel action, that route to the OSC is not
open to them.
MR. STEWART: That -- that is the position
that they’ve taken in the brief. The position of the
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that true? What do you think?
MR. STEWART: -- the position of the OSC and
the Department of Justice is that OSC’s jurisdiction
over FAA employees is not limited to whistleblower
complaints.
Now -- now, it’s clear that in the run of
complaints, with respect to employees of other Federal
agencies, I don’t think there’s any dispute between the
parties that OSC’s jurisdiction would extend beyond
whistleblower complaints. The -- the only point of
dispute is with respect to the FAA.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, let me just be
sure I understand. In the Government’s view, is it a
personnel action or is it not?
MR. STEWART: No, it’s not. And indeed, in
footnote 28 of this Court’s decision in Bush v. Lucas,
the Court specifically identified warrantless searches
as an example of conduct in which an employer might
engage towards its employees that would not constitute
a personnel action. And we think that’s good authority
for the proposition that an allegedly unconstitutional
drug test is not a personnel action.
Now, if the employee had refused to take the
test and been dismissed or disciplined, that would be a
personnel action.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in those circuits
which allow these cases to go to courts, has there been
any indication that the courts are flooded with a
number of these cases or --
MR. STEWART: Not -- no, not that I’m aware
of. Obviously, in -- in other circuits, we prevailed
on the -- the theory that the CSRA precludes review
even of constitutional claims.
And again, if I could return just for a
moment to the -- the point I was making earlier about
the grievance procedure. Congress has clearly
manifested a preference for the inclusion of grievance
procedures in collective bargaining agreements, and --
and given that express congressional preference, it
doesn’t seem right for this Court to assume that the
grievance procedures won’t work.
And this seems to be an ideal example of a
case that potentially implicates constitutional issues
but that still falls squarely within the expertise of
the union, the arbitrator, and the FLRA. That is, the
dispute here concerns whether, in fact, petitioner was
tested more frequently than his colleagues, and if so,
what was the explanation? Was it simply random
deviations? Was it potentially a -- a glitch in the
computer program that was used to generate a random
list of names, or was there some invidious motivation
as -- as petitioner has suggested? The resolution of
those types of questions falls entirely within the
expertise of the participants in the grievance process
even though constitutional law per se is not what labor
arbitrators are best at.
And so, I guess to -- to return for a second
to -- to Justice Scalia’s question about why shouldn’t
the CSRA be read to preclude judicial review of
constitutional claims altogether. I mean, we certainly
think that if -- in a sense, that’s -- that’s a debate
we would be happy to lose. That is, the Government has
not suggested that we have an affirmative interest in
preserving judicial review of those claims, and if the
Court were looking for a -- the simplest solution to
the problem, that solution would be -- have just as
much to recommend it as petitioner’s solution, which is
that you go straight into Federal district court.
However, we don’t think that Congress has
spoken with the degree of clarity that this Court’s
decisions demand to preclude all judicial review of
constitutional challenges, and we think the best way of
reconciling that presumption of judicial review with
the comprehensive nature of the CSRA scheme is to
provide that claims -- constitutional claims are
reviewable if, and only if, the plaintiff has made all
reasonable efforts to utilize the available
administrative remedies.
If the Court has no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Stewart.
Ms. Karlan, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. KARLAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I -- I think it’s clear at this point that
the Government really is asking this Court to rewrite
the CSRA on the fly. As late as page 48 of their brief
on the merits, they wouldn’t tell us whether our client
should go to Federal district court or to the court of
appeals. Then in response to Justice Scalia’s
question, they say, well, you could rewrite
02(a)(2)(A)(xi) and (x). And I think the CSRA is a
sufficiently detailed and comprehensive statute that
this Court has resisted rewriting several times.
JUSTICE BREYER: But it’s not rewriting. I
mean -- I mean, it’s perhaps.
MS. KARLAN: It is.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. You think --
fine.
The -- the -- but the -- the issue it seems
that could be dispositive of this, in respect to the
non-constitutional claims -- and this is why I want to
get your response -- is simply that it is a fair
implication from Congress having set up on non-
constitutional matters a system of arbitration to
require your client to go through that system before
seeking to get review of the non-constitutional matters
in a Federal district court. Now, that’s the normal
rule in administrative law. What is the argument that
it wouldn’t apply in your case?
MS. KARLAN: That the system of collective
bargaining negotiated grievance processes here is set
up in a way that does not filter it into judicial
review. And therefore -- in 1994, when Congress
amended section --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now you want us to hold you
don’t have judicial review --
MS. KARLAN: No, no.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- under the statute.
MS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. We think that
that goes straight under the APA.
Now, here’s the real problem with the
Government --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, but the answer --
please, I didn’t mean to cut off your answer.
MS. KARLAN: I know.
JUSTICE BREYER: I want to hear your answer
to the question that if I agree with you that on non-
constitutional matters, if this system doesn’t work for
your client, he gets review in a Federal district
court. Suppose I agree with you on that. What is the
argument against requiring him to exhaust the remedy
that is there, namely a request for arbitration --
MS. KARLAN: The argument against it --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- as an implication from
the statute?
MS. KARLAN: The argument against it in this
case, which stems, from among other things, this
Court’s decision in Zipes against TWA and in Heckler
against Day, is the Government waived any claim that
our client should have been required to exhaust. They
never raised that issue below, and this Court has
repeatedly held that a failure to raise a non-
exhaustion defense is waiver of that defense. You
should wait until you have a case where there has been
briefing and factfinding.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, is there
any other claim -- any other answer to the argument
other than they waived it?
MS. KARLAN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: What?
MS. KARLAN: And that is that when Congress
amended 7121(a) in 1994, they amended it to make clear
that it had no effect on judicial causes of action that
arose from elsewhere. That’s what the insertion of the
word administrative there was done. It was not done in
order to create an exhaustion regime, but rather, to
eliminate a preclusion regime. And we set this out
quite carefully in our brief, as do the two union
amici, as to what the purpose of the grievance
procedure is here. It is not to create an exhaustion
regime and certainly not to create an exhaustion regime
with what the Government, at least, concedes under the
statute, as now written, is not a personnel action.
That is, the CSRA is quite comprehensive with
regard to personnel actions, but it leaves to
traditional sources of judicial enforcement things that
are not personnel actions. And as this Court’s opinion
in Bush against Lucas makes absolutely clear, a
warrantless search of the kind to which our client was
subjected is not a personnel action and, therefore, is
not within the comprehensive scheme of the CSRA for
dealing with personnel actions.
Thank you.
JUSTICE BREYER: Did I -- could you give --
give the same answer --
MS. KARLAN: Absolutely.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- in respect to your
constitutional claim? Why, given the presence of
section 705 of the act --
MS. KARLAN: Well, we --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- one’s -- forget it.
MS. KARLAN: Oh, oh.
JUSTICE BREYER: Your time is up. That’s --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I get to say that.
Your time is up.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.
MS. KARLAN: Thank you, both.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is
submitted.
