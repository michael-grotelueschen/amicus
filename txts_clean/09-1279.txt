CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 09-1279, Federal
Communications Commission v. AT&T, Inc.
Mr. Yang.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The court of appeals has held that FOIA's
statutory protection for personal privacy in
Exemption 7(C) extends beyond the privacy of individuals
and protects the so-called personal privacy of
corporations. That holding is inconsistent with the
text of Exemption 7(C), FOIA's broader context, and the
statute's drafting history, and would lead to anomalous
results.
The word "personal," standing alone, refers
to individual -- an individual human being. "Privacy,"
standing alone, and even more so in the context of the
phrase "invasion of privacy," invokes purely individual
concepts. And the sum of those terms -- that is, the
statutory phrase used in FOIA, "personal privacy" -- is
greater than the sum of its parts. It's long been well
settled that corporations have no personal privacy.
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it true that there are
contexts in the law in which the word "personal" is used
to refer to a corporation? For example, you could refer
to personal jurisdiction over a corporation, couldn't
you?
MR. YANG: There are -- the term "personal"
is sometimes used as a term of art, and I think personal
jurisdiction is one of those. It is the modern, shorter
term of art for jurisdiction in personam and reflects a
distinction drawn still in the law between cases brought
in personam and cases brought in rem.
That -- the evolution of that term in the
law as a term of art does not reflect what the ordinary
meaning of "personal" is. It's just the same as the
term "personal property," which also invokes
long-established traditional distinctions between
property that could be recovered in rem or in real
actions versus property that might be recovered in
actions in personam.
So -- and, in fact, I think it -- it's
important to note that there are -- although maybe there
are some instances that -- I think there's one instance
that AT&T cites in its brief. Nothing -- it never cited
any use of the term "personal" to mean corporate or
pertaining to a corporation. And when -- when you --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- what about
personal appearances?
MR. YANG: A personal appearance, I think
that -- that supports our position as well. If you're
making a personal appearance, it's not something that a
corporation does. A corporation is a -- a legal
construct. It doesn't exist as a thing that can make an
appearance.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in ordinary speech,
the term "personal" is not -- the term "person" is not
used to refer to a corporation. That's -- that's
legalese. But in -- but since the -- the Administrative
Procedure Act defines a person to include a corporation,
why is it relevant here or dispositive here to look to
the ordinary usage of term "personal" as opposed to the
way it's -- it's used in the law? And in the law, it is
sometimes used to refer to a corporation.
MR. YANG: Well, I think that -- that point
actually reinforces our position, because although
"person" is used in certain legal contexts to refer
to artificial persons and corporations and the like,
"personal" is not.
And "personal," as we explain in our brief,
is not simply a grammatical alteration, an inflection of
the term "person." It has existed in its own right
since the late 1300s and has developed meaning that is
unique to the term "personal," which --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang, can we go back
first to this -- the request came in and, as I
understand it, the Commission said there are two
exemptions: The one for trade secrets, commercial,
financial confidential information; and then there was
one with Exemption 7 itself but as to the employee.
MR. YANG: Correct. There was an additional
exemption, Exemption 5, which protected internal
government communications. But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does the -- does the
Commission, unaided by AT&T, go through the papers and
decide what would be embarrassing for an AT&T employee,
as distinguished from the corporation?
MR. YANG: How does it do that?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. YANG: Well, I -- I don't think the
touchstone is necessarily embarrassment. What the
government does, following this Court's decision in
Reporters Committee, is tries to determine whether there
is a personal privacy interest about individuals, and
that is information that pertains to particular
individuals.
For instance, in this Court's decision in
DOD v. FLRA, the Court explained that, although an
agency released the name of individuals, it could
properly withhold the addresses, the home addresses, of
those individuals, even though that might be publicly
available in phone books, because individuals have at
least some small personal privacy interest in that.
So what the agency will do is try to
identify information pertaining to individuals and then
will conduct -- if there is certain information, will
try to conduct a balancing to determine whether there is
a public interest in disclosure, that is, whether
revealing this would disclose information against the
government.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in that instance,
does the corporation have standing to raise that
objection on the employee's behalf?
MR. YANG: Well, I think the corporation to
the -- in a reverse FOIA case, for instance, which is
what we have here, where the corporation is alleging
that the government's decision-making process is
arbitrary and capricious, it has Article III standing to
resist the disclosure of documents. If you're using
standing kind of like a Fourth Amendment concept of
standing, I don't think that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as an administrative
matter, can the corporation make a FOIA objection on
behalf of its employees?
MR. YANG: It can make an objection on its
own behalf, which is to say that the government has not
properly gone through the decision-making process by
not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. That's the
next -- that was going to be my next question: So the
corporation can raise FOIA on its own behalf?
MR. YANG: It's actually -- let me take a
step back. FOIA actions are actions which seek to
increase the amount of documents that the government has
released pursuant to a FOIA request.
We have also reverse FOIA actions, which are
actions under the APA and here under the Hobbs Act's
review provisions, that would give the court of appeals
jurisdiction. When there's a reverse FOIA action, the
claim is that the agency's final agency action is
somehow arbitrary, capricious, and not -- or contrary to
law. And so in this case, the FCC has certain
regulations which govern its processing of FOIA
requests. And AT&T's claim, as we understand it, is
that the FCC did not comply with its regulations, and,
therefore, its decision was arbitrary capricious because
its regulations required that it consider the personal
privacy interest of individuals.
And I should note that, with respect to
Exemption 6 or Exemption 7(C), the government itself
invokes personal privacy of individuals. That's what we
do when we process FOIA requests, because individuals
normally don't get any notice that there has been a FOIA
request. The government simply processes it and asserts
those rights, in a sense that they're rights, asserts
those interests on behalf of corporations -- on behalf
of individuals.
Going back to the text of the statute, the
term "privacy," and particularly an invasion of privacy,
invokes concepts that back to Warren and Brandeis's
right of privacy, the -- their article which explained
that or identified in the law certain human dignitary
interests that they gave the label "privacy."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, privacy
certainly isn't as limited as you argue "person,"
"personal," is. Corporations have private property.
They have private documents. The concept certainly
applies in the corporate context as it does in the
individual.
MR. YANG: I think the term "privacy," its
ordinary meaning, not the only meaning but the ordinary
and the commonly used meaning, does invoke individual
concepts. When corporations or other entities are at
issue, normally the more appropriate word would be
"confidentiality" or "secrecy." Those concepts --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have
confidential property or secret property. You have
private property.
MR. YANG: Well, true. But it's is not
privacy. When we're talking about the right of privacy,
those -- that word we think -- again going back to
Warren and Brandeis and up through the fifties and
sixties when Prosser was elaborating the law of torts in
his groundbreaking article on privacy, those concepts
apply only to individuals, and particularly when you
combine the terms.
I mean, the Restatement makes clear, and
back to Prosser it was clear, that corporations have no
right of personal privacy. So when Congress in 1974 was
enacting Exemption 7(C), there would have been no basis
for it to conclude that the rights that it was
conferring through the phrase "personal privacy" would
confer rights not -- beyond individuals, to
corporations, and by necessarily implication, if AT&T is
correct, foreign governments, State governments, local
governments. There's no predicate for those types of
entities having personal privacy in the law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Our cases assert, do they
not, that the exceptions to FOIA should be narrowly
construed?
MR. YANG: There are cases --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And we've said that on a
number of cases.
MR. YANG: In certain contexts, this Court
has indicated that exceptions are to be narrowly
construed. We think that, when read in context, those
cases and other cases of this Court explain that FOIA's
exemptions are to be given meaningful reach, because
what Congress was trying to do in FOIA -- and this is
somewhat against our interest in this case, and we
explain it more fully in our brief in Milner, which is
currently pending to the Court -- what Congress was
trying to do in FOIA was to establish a general
principle of disclosure, but in the exemptions it
identified very important interests that warranted an
exception from those general rules. And to narrowly
construe the exception, we think, would distort rather
than advance congressional purpose in enacting FOIA.
JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose Congress had used
the phrase "privacy of a person," "privacy of any
person." Would you make the same argument?
MR. YANG: Our argument would be a little
different, particularly in the context of Exemptions 6
and 7(C), where the phrase would be "an invasion of
privacy of any person."
We think, particularly when we're talking
about invasions of privacy, even though a corporation
might have a broader definitional meaning in context,
Congress in that case would still, we think, be
referring to individuals. But, of course, that's not
this case. That would make it a little bit more
difficult. We think we would probably still prevail on
that reading. But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Privacy
Act? The Privacy Act undoubtedly concerns individuals,
human individuals --
MR. YANG: Correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- not artificial beings.
But it uses the words "individual privacy" --
MR. YANG: Well, it actually uses both
phrases. It uses, as we explain in our brief, the
phrase "personal privacy" to explain that that's what
the Act was protecting. And then within the operative
portions of the Act, it uses "individual," but it does
so for a very specific reason. Congress was intending
to protect a subset of individuals, and it defined the
term "individual" to mean U.S. citizens and lawful
permanent residents.
So not all individuals would be protected by
the Privacy Act. Now, Congress did that, not because
had it used the phrase "personal privacy" it would have
been extending rights to corporations and foreign
governments, but because personal privacy would have
been too broad in that it would have -- even though it
would have been limited to individuals, it would have
included a set of individuals that Congress wanted to
exclude, that is, everybody who is not a U.S. citizen or
lawful permanent resident.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you a
question? I'm not sure I understood your response to
Justice Scalia. If there is ambiguity, if a term can be
given two meanings, and it's not clear -- and I know
you're challenging the clarity question here -- I
thought that Congress's intent to have full disclosure
would necessarily mean that where there's ambiguity as
to the meaning of an exception, then we should change
the narrowest meaning.
MR. YANG: Well, I think we disagree, and I
think this is why: No legislation pursues its primary
goal at all costs, and the FOIA exceptions that are at
issue here protect very important values that Congress
deemed to warrant exceptions from the rule. And so if
the Court were to put a thumb on one scale of that
balance that Congress has tried to strike, after using
all the normal tools of construction, we think that
would distort rather than advance the intent of
Congress.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.
We're not putting a thumb on the scale. Taking account
of the fact that -- that Congress has many objectives in
any legislation and that the limitations are as
important as the -- the substantive end, nonetheless,
when, having applied all of that, you end up with, gee,
I don't know, it's ambiguous -- you say, even in that
situation, we don't apply the rule that --
MR. YANG: Well, if you were to -- after
using all the normal tools that the Court does and
you're --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that's what
ambiguity means. It does -- it means --
MR. YANG: That's usually a very rare
instance, that you're exactly at equipoise. And -- and
we certainly aren't relying on narrow construction in
this case, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. The Government wants
to abandon the principle that we've set forth in our
cases --
MR. YANG: Well, we think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that exceptions to FOIA
are to be narrowly construed. The Government does not
support that.
MR. YANG: We do not embrace that principle.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though we did? I
mean --
MR. YANG: Well, we think that those
cases -- there are -- there are two lines of this
Court's decisions. Sometimes the Court explains that
exceptions are narrowly construed, and sometimes the
Court explained that its decision has given -- its
decisions have given the exceptions practical reach in
order to strike the appropriate balance that Congress
has tried to strike in FOIA.
Now, let me just say, our narrow
construction, to the extent the Court would want to
reaffirm it here -- we're not advancing that -- would
only help the Government's position.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your argument is based on
a case that will come before us. So -- but in this
case, it's to your interest to say, yes, that has been
-- that has been the Court's precedent, that FOIA
exceptions are to be narrowly construed.
MR. YANG: Well, the Government has broader
interests beyond a single case, and we think that,
again, we're not embracing strict construction in this
case. But, again, that would only help the Government's
position if you were to disagree.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not going to help
the Government's position if the Government doesn't want
to be helped.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm happy to leave you
where you put yourself.
MR. YANG: And we -- we accept that in this
case, and we think that the language of the text,
particularly when read in context in light of the
statutory history, and particularly when you take a look
at what's gone on since 1974 -- I mean, in the more than
years since, there has been uniform agreement that
Exemptions 6 and 7(C) apply only to individuals.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose -- I
suppose families have rights of personal privacy, don't
they?
MR. YANG: Well, in certain contexts, family
members, as this Court decided in Favish, can have a
right to personal privacy. But the Court in Favish
recognized that that was a very, you know, significant
departure from the prior understanding that the right of
personal privacy in FOIA protects information about the
individual, him- or herself, and recognized that there
was another strain of personal privacy, which from
longstanding tradition in terms of -- within our
society, the Court could draw on in saying that personal
privacy should also protect, at least in the context
of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in some
contexts -- in some contexts, personal privacy does go
beyond the individual?
MR. YANG: No, still it is individual. I
mean, those are individual members of the family.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Aggregations of
individuals?
MR. YANG: Well, no. I think an individual
member of the family has a personal privacy interest by
virtue of the relationship to the decedent in Favish.
Let me go back. Just -- I think I would be
remiss if I didn't remark upon this Court's decision --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. To go back to
the Chief's question, you do not deny that the
individuals who form the corporation, the officers and
the employees, are protected by the right of personal
privacy, and, indeed, you will -- you will edit any FOIA
responses to protect those individuals, even though
there are many of them, right?
MR. YANG: Correct. If there were --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But as individuals, not as
-- not as the corporation.
MR. YANG: As individuals, because the
information pertains to them.
Now, going to the American Express case,
which we explain in our reply, I think that is fatal to
the proposition that -- the proposition of AT&T that
there's a grammatical imperative that adjectives take
the meaning of a related noun.
In American Express, the Court construed the
Truth in Lending Act, which includes the definition of
"person" to include, for instance, corporations. It
then went on to construe a term, "consumer," which
concerns transactions primarily for personal, family,
household, or, at the time, agricultural purposes. The
Court explained that a transaction -- the transaction
that was conducted for a corporation's business
purposes, that it could not -- there was -- "it did not
fall within any of the purposes specified" -- that was a
quote -- in the definition of "consumer." That is, it
did not concern personal purposes. We think that's
fatal.
The Court, in fact, said it was the only
possible conclusion and that there was no other possible
interpretation of the statutory phrase, after repeating
the enumeration of those four factors three times and
then on the very next page saying corporate -- a
transaction for corporate business purposes could not
be fit within that definition.
Finally, I'd like to remark upon the
anomalies that this Court would set us forth upon if it
were to decide that corporations have personal privacy.
At least in the context of individuals,
there's an established body of law and societal
understanding of what a person, an individual, might
have a personal privacy interest in. But if we expand
personal to include corporations, foreign governments,
State governments, local governments, defining what
would be personal privacy of those institutions would
require an extraordinary exercise, a simple policy
judgment on the part of the agencies first and then the
Court.
And this Court in Favish was careful to
explain that that type of decision making would be
improper in that appropriate guides to -- to limit and
make objective a court and agency's decision making is
required.
Congress provided no benchmarks, never
addressed corporate, foreign governments, or any other
non-human entity in the context of personal privacy.
And, again, for 36 years, there's been
uniform agreement that personal privacy applies in this
context only to corporations.
If there are no further questions --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if an
individual has been -- individual human being has been
investigated by the FBI and a FOIA request is made for
records related to that investigation, would the name of
the individual not be turned over?
MR. YANG: Well, if someone is asking for an
investigation of Tony Yang --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes.
MR. YANG: -- our -- I don't -- I can't say
definitively, but I think I can probably answer that
that even -- even answering the question of whether
there is a responsive record answers the question. So
I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the point.
So really your adversary is saying that the same harm
that occurs to an individual -- putting aside the
difficulty of defining privacy more broadly, but the
same harm that occurs to an individual who is disclosed
to have been the target of an investigation is an
identical privacy right of a corporation, that a
corporation has the same negative effects as the
individual.
MR. YANG: I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I think they would
concede that privacy might need to be defined
differently for corporations. They're simply saying
this privacy interest is not.
MR. YANG: Well, the key point is that we
don't deny that corporations have some interest in
confidentiality that exists out there. For instance,
AT&T has relied upon the common law of defamation where
a corporation's business interests, business reputation,
is implicated. But even --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, parts of -- they
pled guilty already. So it is hard to imagine how much
exponentially more damaging --
MR. YANG: Well, to be fair to AT&T, there
was a settlement agreement in which they did not admit
any wrongdoing. So --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that presupposes
some sort of investigation. So that's public knowledge
already.
MR. YANG: That is public knowledge. But I
think the key point is that the corporate -- a
corporation's interests in maintaining its business
reputation has been not regarded as a personal privacy
interest. It's true that they have interests, and FOIA
protects those interests, for instance, interests in
confidential commercial or financial information under
Exemption 4.
And so what really the -- we come back to
the key point, which is when Congress used the phrase
"personal privacy," it would have had no reason in 1974,
or even now, to think that term would have referred to
corporations. The fact that corporations have other
interests and other rights that might be legitimate is
kind of beside the point because those interests are not
referred to in the law or otherwise as personal privacy
interests.
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Yang.
MR. YANG: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Klineberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY M. KLINEBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KLINEBERG: Thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether any
organization, including not only business corporations
like AT&T but also nonprofit organizations and political
associations, should be categorically excluded from
protection under Exemption 7(C), such that this
exemption will now offer less protection for privacy
interests than the Constitution and the common law.
This Court has consistently held that the
privacy protections under FOIA are broader. And the
text supports that position.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you include in this
the people, the persons that you say are shielded by
this privacy exemption, as Mr. Yang said, foreign
governments, State and local governments? Those have
all -- those all fall under the APA definition of
person.
MR. KLINEBERG: Justice Ginsburg, they do.
And we would agree that, as a matter of statutory
construction, the concept of personal privacy does apply
to those -- those other categories of actors. Now,
whether once that privacy interest is balanced against
the public's interest in disclosure, that balance may
well be different with respect to public or foreign
entities, but -- but certainly they -- they have a right
to personal privacy under the terms of the statute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you give us an idea
of -- the corporation has been shielded by Exemption 4
for its confidential financial information, trade
secrets; and its employees have been protected under
Exemption 7.
What is it, what would be -- would fall
within this privacy exception that would not be
confidential business information or relate to employees
of the corporation?
MR. KLINEBERG: Justice Ginsburg, we -- I
could give you two categories or kinds of examples. One
is, for example, a series of e-mails among corporate
officers -- granted, whose own personal names and
identifying information have been redacted, but in those
e-mails, they may engage in a frank exchange about the
competence and intelligence of a would-be regulator of
the corporation or a -- disparaging comments about
potential --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Why does that
relate to their privacy? I don't understand that. Why
does that relate to the corporation's privacy interest?
Anything that would embarrass the corporation is -- is a
privacy interest?
MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, the --
the answer is simply that these were communications,
conversations, that were occurring with an expectation
of privacy by the individuals involved on behalf of
their employer, and to the extent that they could be
used to harm the reputation or the customer goodwill of
-- of the company, they do, indeed, have a -- a personal
privacy interest in --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Anything that hurts the --
the -- the image or the goodwill of the company?
MR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, everything that
with -- that is intended to be private is certainly
subject to the balancing that we're asking for under
Exemption 7(C); indeed, that Congress provided, that if
it's -- it's an interest in personal privacy, then it is
to be balanced to determine whether the disclosure of
that document is unwarranted.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Klineberg, can you give
me any example of -- your -- your brief talks a lot
about the adjective "personal." But we're not talking
just about the adjective "personal." What about the
phrase "personal privacy"?
"Personal," yes, can indeed apply to
corporations sometimes, but there are certain phrases
where it clearly does not. For example, you talk about
personal characteristics. That doesn't mean the
characteristics of General Motors. You talk about
personal qualities. It doesn't mean the qualities of
General Motors. You talk about a point of personal
privilege. It's not a privilege of a corporation.
And I think personal privacy is the same
thing. Can you give me any examples in common usage
where people would refer to the personal privacy of a --
of a corporation? It's a very strange phrase to me.
MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Your Honor, as
Justice Alito asked my -- my colleague earlier, the --
the whole concept of -- of "person" as including a
corporation would surprise many people, the proverbial
person on the street.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I'm not talking about
that. I'll grant you that -- that "personal" could
sometimes refer to a corporation, although the
Government distinguishes it by etymology and so forth.
Never mind that. I'm talking about personal privacy.
Do you have any examples from the New York Times, from,
you know, Boswell, from anywhere, that anybody refers to
the interests of a corporation as the "personal privacy"
of General Motors?
I cannot imagine somebody using the phrase
like that.
MR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, we're not aware
of that phrase being used certainly in any statutory
context --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you were about to
give a second example of where, even though it hasn't --
personal privacy hasn't been used in -- but you said one
example is the two officials who are saying unpleasant
things about a regulator. And what was your other
example?
MR. KLINEBERG: Well, there's a -- there's a
sub-example within that category which is the
disparaging of an important customer, some unpleasant
comments about an important customer of the corporation
that could then be used quite -- quite clearly by a --
by a competitor to -- to harm the goodwill of the -- of
the corporation with respect to that customer.
But there is indeed another whole category
of documents that goes beyond the -- the context of
AT&T's interest here, and the example is internal
documents within, say, an environmental nonprofit
organization talking about their political strategies
for defeating an amendment to the Clean Air Act.
As an example, those political strategies
that were shared internally by -- by members of the
organization without any intent to -- to have them
become public would become subject to -- to automatic
disclosures, categorical disclosure, were the Government
to prevail in this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it's --
how does that work? If you have -- the president of the
environmental organization says something about whatever
it is -- we can lobby this guy to get this change -- is
he able to protect that on the grounds of his personal
privacy, even though the embarrassment would go to the
-- the organization as a whole?
MR. KLINEBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe
the answer is in most cases "yes," that in -- that the
identity of the -- the specific speaker and any
identifying information corresponding to him or her
would be protected.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why is it such
a big deal, then, to extend that to the organization as
a whole, if the individual's privacy is already going to
be protected?
MR. KLINEBERG: Indeed, Your Honor, I think
that is -- that is our position, that -- that the
personal privacy of the corporation is -- is affected by
such disclosure.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I mean
you're -- you're already protected, at least to a
significant extent, because the individual officers
would be able to assert a privacy interest, to the
extent at least that what you find embarrassing to -- to
the corporation is also individually embarrassing to
them.
MR. KLINEBERG: Right. But the -- but the
redactions that would occur would in all likelihood
simply be redactions of their names and perhaps their
titles, but their -- the substance of their comments
would certainly be -- would be disclosed under the
Government's view.
JUSTICE BREYER: Are there any examples that
you have? That is, in the last 35 years, has there been
any instance where the Justice Department or some other
law enforcement agency compiled a file for law
enforcement purposes, that in that file there were, for
whatever reasons, a bunch of conversations about the
organization's strategy, and it did not interfere to
release it with -- with anybody's personal privacy, but
it might interfere with that organization's strategy,
and so the organization, whatever it was, the NRDC or
something, was very upset about it?
Did you find a single example or a thousand
examples? Or how many examples did you find of that
happening?
MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Justice Breyer, one of
the -- one of the things that has puzzled us in this
case is why -- why it has taken 35 years --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, one reason might be
that this has really never been a problem because all
the legitimate -- or most of them, anyway -- that these
organizations that have interests in privacy are
actually taken care of by the other 17 exemptions here.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Another reason might be
that personal -- nobody ever thought that personal
privacy would cover this.
JUSTICE BREYER: This may be the first one.
That's why I want to know, is there -- one of the things
you would have looked for is an example of a real
problem of the kind you're talking about. I'm not
saying you don't have one. I would just like to know if
you found any, and what they are, so I could read them.
MR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, we haven't found
anything specific to the -- in response to your
question.
But I -- I will say that one of the
explanations for why this issue has become more
important today than maybe it has been in recent past --
there really are three reasons. One is that Exemption
, which Mr. Yang discussed, has been increasingly
narrowed by the courts of appeals to the point where
they specifically say, and, indeed, the Government
concedes, that -- that the reputational concerns and the
harm to customer goodwill is not the sort of harm that
Exemption 4 guards against.
And so that has become increasingly clear
among the courts of appeals, that the interests in
confidentiality that we're talking about under exception
(C) are not --
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, one possible reason
you don't find them is because it's very rare that a law
enforcement agency is going to try to subpoena the top
strategy of the -- of the NRDC, confidential strategy.
There might not be too many such records.
It -- another reason might be is that they
don't really care. Another reason might be -- I don't
know.
But if you haven't found any examples, what
we're back to -- or -- and maybe there are actual
examples of that -- of what you said to Justice Ginsburg
of the other instance, where the -- what was that first
one?
MR. KLINEBERG: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to know about the
example. What was the first one again?
MR. KLINEBERG: Well, the -- the first one
was comments -- comments about a regulator or --
JUSTICE BREYER: They're worried about
saying something mean about a regulator. Okay. Yes,
fine. Are there examples of that? Is this the first
one, and what's the empirical state?
MR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, it's a -- I
cannot point you to specific examples. They're --
they're sort of hard to -- hard to find in the -- in the
sense that they are -- that they're not typically
litigated, and they certainly haven't been litigated
under -- under this -- under this exemption before.
But -- but I think the other explanation for
why this matters today in a way that it might not have
mattered so much before, two -- two other reasons: One
is that -- that increasingly, FOIA is being used by --
by competitors and legal adversaries to obtain
information, not about what the government is doing, not
about what the government is up to, but about what
evidence the government might have gathered from private
parties.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that a reason to
change what was the understanding of Exemption 7? One
of the items that doesn't work in your favor was the
Attorney General's memorandum at the time of the '74
amendments.
MR. KLINEBERG: Well, actually, Justice
Ginsburg, at the time of the '74 amendments the only
existing Attorney General memorandum was that of
Attorney General Clark, which read "personal privacy" --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm talking about the --
Attorney General Levi.
MR. KLINEBERG: Right, and that -- that was
issued subsequent to the amendments in 1974, and that
was an -- an interpretive gloss on the recent
amendments.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, that's what I meant.
MR. KLINEBERG: Right. And so at the time
that Congress enacted the amendments, both under the
Privacy Act as well as Exemption 7(C), the -- the only
existing statement about what personal privacy might
mean would be -- would have been Attorney General
Clark's understanding that personal privacy can in fact
incorporate interests of corporations.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But if Attorney General
Levi's description, which was -- which was issued for
the purpose of telling all the agencies of the Federal
Government what this new statute meant -- and it had a
lot of ambiguities in it -- if that was wrong about --
about this subject, you'd have thought somebody would
have objected.
I mean, did some members of Congress who --
who had passed FOIA say this is outrageous; what about
the personal privacy of General Motors? I'm not aware
of any objections along those lines.
MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Your Honor, the --
Attorney General Levi's memorandum did not go into a
long discussion or description of the -- of the
analysis. It simply said it does not appear or does not
seem to apply to -- to corporations. And it's
absolutely true. There -- this is not -- this issue
hasn't -- hasn't really been litigated and presented.
But our position is that there is nothing in
the plain language that would indicate that Congress
intended to categorically exclude corporations. It is
certainly true that the legislative history at the time,
as the Government spends quite a bit of time exploring,
does suggest that what was -- what was in most people's
minds was protection of individual privacy. But there
is no indication that they intended to exclude --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it the burden of the
Government to show that they intended to exclude
corporations, or is it your burden to show that this
exception was meant to include corporations? I would
think the latter is where the burden lies in this case.
MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, our --
our burden is to -- is to defend our view of the
statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but if you're asking
the Government to show that the -- there was an intent
to exclude corporations, I don't think that's their
burden. I think it's your burden to show that this
exemption was intended to include corporations.
MR. KLINEBERG: I agree, Your Honor, that we
are -- our burden is to demonstrate to you why the words
"personal privacy" in the statute apply to corporations.
I think one of the background facts is that there is no
indication that anyone thought that it was not to be
included. But let me --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your
central argument is that because "person" is defined to
include corporation, "personal" in the same statute must
include corporate.
I tried to sit down and come up with other
examples where the adjective was very different from the
root noun. And it turns out it's not hard at all. You
have "craft" and "crafty." Totally different. "Crafty"
doesn't have much to do with "craft." "Squirrel,"
"squirrelly." Right?
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, "pastor" --
you have a "pastor" and "pastoral." Same root, totally
different.
So I don't understand -- I don't think
there's much to the argument that because "person" means
one thing, "personal" has to be the same relation.
MR. KLINEBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, let me
try to explain precisely what our proposed rule of
construction is, because I think there's been some
confusion, and I -- and I think the Government has --
has not properly characterized it, and certainly in
their reply brief.
We do not agree -- or we do not sign on to
the term "grammatical imperative," because our concern
with that phrase is that it might suggest that the rule
is to be applied regardless of the consequences, and
that is not our position.
Our position is that where the adjective
means "of or relating to" a term that Congress has
expressly defined, that definition should be applied, so
long as it makes sense to do so in light of the text and
structure of the statute as a whole.
So, in this case, Your Honor, "personal"
does -- is defined -- when you open up the dictionary,
the very first definition is "of or relating to a
particular person." "Person" is, then, defined by
Congress as -- to include not only individuals, but --
but corporations and other associations.
So in this particular context, it makes
perfect sense to look to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Klineberg, you have
read the brief of the Project on Government Oversight,
where they give dozens and dozens of examples to show
that, overwhelmingly, "personal" is used to describe an
individual, not an artificial being. And it is the
overwhelming use of "personal."
MR. KLINEBERG: Justice Ginsburg, we do not
dispute that personal is often, even many, many times,
used to describe an individual and can only be
understood in that context. Indeed, the Truth in
Lending Act argument that the Government made in its
reply brief is a perfect example. The word "personal"
there is -- is mentioned alongside "personal," "family,"
and "household."
And, indeed, even in that very same
statutory definition of "consumer," the word is referred
to as "a natural person." So, in that context, it would
be absurd or inappropriate to -- to borrow the concept
of the definition of "person."
All we're saying is when it is not absurd,
when it is not -- does not do violence to the statute,
under those circumstances, it makes perfect sense to
borrow the definition that Congress provided.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would be similar to
medical files and such, under Exemption 6, that uses the
same phrase, "unwanted invasion on personal privacy"?
So what would your reading do to Exemption 6, and how
would we create or even make sense of Exemption 6?
MR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, we don't believe
our reading does any -- any damage to this Court's
jurisprudence in Exemption 6, and the -- and the simple
reason is that while the words "personal privacy" in
Exemption 6 do mean -- and we agree with the Attorney
General Clark in this -- do mean that -- that -- the
same thing as it means in Exemption 7(C), but because --
precisely for the reason you said, Justice Sotomayor --
the personnel and medical and similar files limits the
likely scope of that privacy interest to individual,
natural -- natural persons. And that's simply not
because of the words "personal privacy," but because of
the company that those words keep in that -- in that
particular exemption.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? I mean, if you're
saying that personal privacy has some overlap with
individual privacy -- obviously, it has to if you're
going to give meaning to personal privacy -- don't we
have to give meaning to "and similar files"? And so
what would those be?
MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Your Honor, as this
Court said in the Washington Post case, the
understanding of "similar files" is defined by the two
benchmarks that are expressly provided, right?
Personnel and medical. So the kinds of files are
limited to the sorts of files in which individual
information is likely to be contained. In that case, it
was a passport file.
Again, our -- our argument is simply that
it's that part of Exemption 6 that does the limiting
work in terms of its scope. The words "personal
privacy" mean the same thing in Exemption 6 as -- as
they do in Exemption 7(C).
The -- the other point that I -- I certainly
want to make clear is that our position is that personal
privacy is only the first step in the determination
whether or not a particular document is disclosed,
because if the Government prevails, there will be no
need even to articulate a public interest in the
disclosure of potentially harmful documents. Instead,
they will be automatically available to any competitor
or legal adversary.
And all we are asking for and, indeed, all
that Congress provided for is that the privacy interest
be weighed against the public interest in disclosure.
And what the -- what the FCC did here was to
categorically exclude corporations from the protections
of Exemption 7(C). And -- and all we are saying is that
those interests are legitimate and just need to be
balanced. And what the government's obligations under
these circumstances are is that they need to weigh the
private interests in -- in the documents against the
articulated public interest in disclosure. And that
interest, of course, has to do with what the government
is up to. What do these documents tell us about what
the government is doing?
And if, as the amici on the Government's
side suggests, there are lots of public -- lots of
public value and public interest in the disclosure, then
that balance is more likely to be weighed in favor of
disclosure. And all we are asking for, though, is that
that balance take place. And what's happened here is
that -- is, as I said; it's a categorical exclusion that
simply is inconsistent with the terms that Congress laid
out in exemption 7(C).
Congress did not intend for FOIA to be a
tool for an organization's adversaries to obtain access
to harmful or embarrassing documents compiled for law
enforcement purposes where such documents do nothing to
open agency action to public scrutiny. If the
Government has its way in this case, the result will be
what this Court decried in Favish, which was that it
would be the failure to protect the privacy of citizens
against the uncontrolled release of information compiled
through the power of the state.
If there are no further questions, I urge
that the -- that the Third Circuit be affirmed. Thank
you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Yang, you have 6 minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. YANG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
AT&T appears to have changed or at least
modified its position somewhat from the position
articulated at page 14 of its brief. There AT&T
says, "By expressly defining the noun 'person' to
include corporations, Congress necessarily defined the
adjective form of that noun -- 'personal' -- also to
include corporations."
Now, AT&T has given up on the grammatical
imperative that guided exclusively the court of appeals'
decision in this case. There's nothing left. AT&T can
provide no example where the term "personal privacy" has
ever been used to refer to a corporation, much less a
foreign government or State or local government in any
context, whether it be FOIA, the law generally, or even
in common usage.
AT&T can provide no example of any problems
that have arisen in over 35 years of the government's
consistent administration of this provision. In fact,
all indications point in simply one direction. Personal
privacy applies only to individuals. The terms
"personal" and the terms "privacy" do that alone. And,
together, "personal privacy makes" that clear.
The legislative history, the decisions of
this Court pointing to the balance applying only to
individuals, individual rights. All point in the same
direction.
We would ask that the Third Circuit be
reversed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Counsel.
The case is submitted.
