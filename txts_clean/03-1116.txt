Mr. Bolick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLINT BOLICK
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1274
MR. BOLICK: Justice Stevens, and may it please
the Court:
For 124 years, as state power over alcohol has
ebbed and flowed, one principle has remained virtually
constant, that states may regulate alcohol by one set of
rules, not by two. New York and Michigan consigned out-
of-state wine, and only out-of-state wine, to the three-
tier system for closing the market to thousands of small
family-run wineries and their customers for the benefit of
a liquor distributor oligopoly.
Discrimination is the core concern of the
Commerce Clause, and it sends a powerful signal that the
state is engaged, not in legitimate regulation, but in
economic protectionism. The states and the liquor
distributors make a sweeping argument that this Court has
consistently rejected, that the Twenty-First Amendment
creates plenary state authority.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under your view, could
the three-tier system, itself, be challenged by a New
Jersey wholesaler wanting to sell in New York, or a New
York wholesaler wanting to sell in New Jersey?
MR. BOLICK: Yes, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, under your view, the whole
three-tier system has to go down?
MR. BOLICK: No, Justice Kennedy. So long as
the state does not discriminate against out-of-state
entities, it is free to, as this Court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under my hypothetical.
I don't know exactly how -- the way it works, you have to
be a New York wholesaler to sell to a New York retailer.
Under your view, a New Jersey wholesaler could sell to a
New York retailer.
MR. BOLICK: That is -- or a challenge, as you
ask the question, Justice Kennedy, could be mounted to
that, under the same theory that we're advocating here.
The state may have a different set of defenses that it
doesn't have here. But --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But so far as -- the rationale
is the same.
MR. BOLICK: The --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that, under
your rationale, that that in-state licensing system has to
fall if there's a New Jersey wholesaler.
MR. BOLICK: It has to pass constitutional
muster.
JUSTICE BREYER: And when you say there is no
precedent -- I mean, I think a much more modest claim than
you're making, the claim simply that a state cannot
discriminate against out-of-state liquor -- i.e., the
physical liquid -- which is really more modest and keeps
the three-tier effect -- now, your -- that claim, that
they couldn't do that, was really what was advanced in
Young's Market. I read the briefs in that case. The
briefs presented that Court -- you could have written
those briefs. And the difficulty for you is, it
articulated that more modest version very clearly, made a
tremendously strong case, that was not forbidden by
Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment. And this Court
squarely rejected it.
MR. BOLICK: Your Honor, Young's Market -- the
result in Young's Market was correct --
JUSTICE BREYER: The result, I understand, you
could put on the basis of there being no discrimination.
MR. BOLICK: Exactly.
JUSTICE BREYER: Reading Justice Brandeis'
opinion, I can't believe that that was the basis for his
result.
MR. BOLICK: The -- the cases that followed
Young's Market and purported to apply its reasoning took a
very sweeping view of the Twenty-First Amendment. The
Court began trenching on that very broad view immediately
in 1939.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why wasn't that broad
view appropriate, given the difference between the
language of the Wilson Act, which has had the words "to
the same extent and in the same manner," and the Webb-
Kenyon Act, which became the second section of the Twenty-
First Amendment, leaves out "to the same extent and the
same manner." It just says that "alcoholic beverage so
that the state can bar importation for delivery of, or use
therein, in violation of laws thereof." It doesn't say
"nondiscriminatory laws."
MR. BOLICK: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the -- there
was no need for the Webb-Kenyon Act to repeat the language
of the Wilson Act. The Wilson Act dealt with the question
of discrimination. The Webb-Kenyon Act dealt with
questions that arose subsequent to the enactment of the
Wilson Act. And as this Court has held in Craig versus --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe that's the Act,
but when they put it in the Constitution, why didn't they
adopt the language, "to the same extent and in the same
manner"?
MR. BOLICK: I think the reason for that is
because it was so obvious that the state could not, prior
to prohibition, discriminate. It was not only embodied in
the Wilson Act, but it was embodied in at least three
cases of this Court.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But it was not obvious to the
person who at least drafted the Webb-Kenyon in the first
instance, because as I -- as I understand it, there was an
anti-discrimination provision, and that was then dropped.
And do we know why it was dropped?
MR. BOLICK: It was dropped essentially because
it was redundant.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but is that a -- is that
on a legislative history record somewhere? Do we know
that?
MR. BOLICK: No, Justice Souter, that is not
expressly on the record. What is on the record, however,
is that the Court was aiming -- or, excuse me, the
Congress was aiming at specific Supreme Court decisions.
There -- and it -- and the one case that was clearest on
point on discrimination was Scott versus Donald, applying
both the Commerce Clause and the Wilson Act to forbid
discrimination. And there was -- there is nothing in the
legislative history to indicate that Congress intended to
overturn that decision. And as this Court has held in
Craig versus Boren, and elsewhere, by enacting the Twenty-
First Amendment, Congress clearly intended to incorporate
both the Wilson Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act and to restore
to the states the police power that they had before
prohibition. Emphatically, discrimination was not a part
of that police power. It was a very accepted context.
So, too, is it today. When the -- when the
liquor distributors in the states asked this Court to
overturn the Bacchus decision and to adopt a plenary view
of the Twenty-First Amendment, it is not just asking you
to overturn the Bacchus decision; it is asking you to
overturn cases starting with the Midcal decision in 1980,
the more recent Healy decision, and others, that have held
that the core purposes of the Commerce Clause and the
Twenty-First Amendment must be harmonized, that the
Commerce Clause was never intended to be obliterated.
And when you look at the core values of the two
clauses, they do not clash. The core purpose of the
Commerce Clause is nondiscrimination. The core purpose of
the Twenty-First Amendment is temperance. And if you have
a discriminatory statute, it sends a very strong signal
that, in fact --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's not only
temperance, but it's control over revenues.
Can you tell me, is the -- is there a New York
State excise tax on alcohol?
MR. BOLICK: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is it collected by the
wholesaler?
MR. BOLICK: Yes, it is.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. What is it, ten
dollars a gallon, or what?
MR. BOLICK: It's -- it turns out to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it on one --
MR. BOLICK: -- a few cents a bottle, yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It is on one --
MR. BOLICK: It's on -- it's -- and all alcohol.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under our cases, can the
California winery be required to remit the tax to the New
York State revenue authorities?
MR. BOLICK: We believe so, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that consistent with Quill?
MR. BOLICK: It is consistent with Quill. The
way that the states -- there are 26 states that allow
direct interstate shipment of wine, and the FTC has
examined their record to see if they are doing okay. And
one of the things that they do -- are able to do is tax
collection. New Hampshire, Louisiana, and Nevada do
collect taxes. The way they do it is by requiring a
permit in order to ship wine into the state. That takes
care of a number of problems, including all sorts of
accountability concerns that the state may raise.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What --
MR. BOLICK: Under --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- what do you make of the
argument that there's no practical way, except at great
expense, to audit compliance if they're out of state?
MR. BOLICK: Justice Souter, this is one of the
most regulated industries in America, of course, and the
model legislation that has been adopted by a number of
states includes record-keeping provisions, it requires
that wineries --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I will grant that's
required, but the argument, as I understand it, is, to
find out whether they're doing what they are required to
do, you've got to drop in unexpectedly and make an audit.
And that's one thing in the state; it's another thing
across the country.
MR. BOLICK: No, it's important to recognize,
Justice Souter, that under the three-tier system, which is
-- which is where the states of New York and Michigan are
saying that the other state wineries have to go -- the
three-tier system does not do that. The states already
rely on the Federal Government and the other states to
police the wineries.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're --
MR. BOLICK: Should they --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- saying they are not dropping
in to local wineries to do audits, in fact?
MR. BOLICK: They may, in some instances. It is
primarily a federal -- a federal activity.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What do we have in the record
on that?
MR. BOLICK: There is not -- there is not a
great deal on the record, either way, on that, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean by
"it's primarily a federal activity," that the Federal
Government polices compliance with the state tax laws?
MR. BOLICK: That's correct, Your Honor. Under
the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How does that occur?
MR. BOLICK: -- under the Federal Alcohol
Administration Act, any violation of a state law is a
federal offense and it is a violation -- so basically,
whether it's under-age access, whether it's taxation,
whatever --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But does the federal authority
make a routine audit to see that the state tax has been
paid?
MR. BOLICK: Basically, every single time that
there is a transaction, it is recorded by the U.S. Trade
and Tax Bureau.
And if it may please the Court, I'd like to
reserve the rest of my time --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. BOLICK: -- for rebuttal.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I have just one further
question. Justice Kennedy asked you, "What about the
wholesaler? What about the retailer?" What about
alcoholic beverages other than wine?
MR. BOLICK: Justice Ginsburg, very important
question. We are here today because a majority of states
have chosen to regulate wine distinctively. And a handful
of them, including Michigan and New York, have chosen to
do so in a discriminatory manner. So long as states do
not discriminate, in terms of direct shipping with regard
to other alcohol -- and they don't; there's a flat
prohibition across the United States, in terms of beer and
other types of spirits -- we will not be here, because
there would be no discrimination; there would be a single
rule, and that rule would be, no one gets to do it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Sullivan?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN SULLIVAN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS IN 03-1116 AND 03-1120
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, and may it
please the Court:
Nothing in today's case, Justice Kennedy,
requires you to take on the three-tier system, for the
issue that is presented here is a very narrow one.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's very narrow, but
the rationale is sweeping, and that's why I asked. I just
don't know if the in-state licensure system, which is the
cornerstone of the three-tier distribution system, can
survive under your rationale, assuming the hypothetical
where a New Jersey wholesaler has all of the -- you know,
the physical facilities and so forth that the New York
wholesaler does.
MS. SULLIVAN: All that we ask in this case,
Justice Kennedy, is that you strike down Michigan and New
York's decision to apply the three-tier system to everyone
except their own in-state --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I know, but what --
MS. SULLIVAN: -- producers of wine --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but you're -- all you're
asking is for a rationale that's sweeping.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, in our case, we
want to suggest that it is -- just as in Healy and Bacchus
-- that a law that discriminates in favor of in-state
producers and against out-of-state producers loses its
immunity afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment. As
Justice Scalia said in concurrence in Healy, a liquor
law's discriminatory character eliminates the immunity
afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment.
It's really the state's position, aided by their
wholesaler allies, that it is the sweeping one. Their
position is that every state law that regulates the
importation of liquor is, per se, valid if it has any
conceivable rational connection to a state purpose. So,
for example, if Michigan wanted to simply bar all
California wines, facially exclude California wines,
saying, "There are too many of them, it interferes with" -
-
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your answer to Justice
Kennedy, I glean from what you said, that if New York took
away the direct-sale privilege that in-state wineries get,
then out-of-state wineries wouldn't be any better off, but
they'd have nothing to complain about.
MS. SULLIVAN: That's exactly correct, Justice
Ginsburg. As you've said in the context of gender
discrimination, you can cure an equal-protection problem
by leveling up or leveling down. In this case, we would
suggest that the principle of free trade that was the
reason, the principal reason, for the framing of the
Constitution and has been reflected in over a century of
dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, suggests that you
should -- the remedy should be to open the markets to out-
of-state producers --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's a decision for the
state to make. I mean, the -- what --
MS. SULLIVAN: Correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not for this Court.
MS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't deny that a state --
that Michigan could bar all out-of-state wine -- not just
-- not just California, but they could bar all out-of-
state wines?
MS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Justice Stevens,
if it were in aid, and only if it were in aid, of the
states -- and necessary to serve the state's internal
purposes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: The only reason being given to
give a monopoly to local producers, that's their --
MS. SULLIVAN: That's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- whole purpose. But could
they do that?
MS. SULLIVAN: The state can have a monopoly if
it's, itself, a market participant. What the state may --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm saying just to look at
the -- just limit to the market to -- the only market
participants would be Michigan wine --
MS. SULLIVAN: Private --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- wineries.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, a state may not
discriminate against out-of-staters for the sole purpose
of economic protectionism.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm trying to think of
what Brandeis could have been thinking.
MS. SULLIVAN: In Young's Market.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's right. And this is
a reconstruction, because I have no doubt, and you have no
doubt, that Section 2 was meant to end that part of the
dormant Commerce Clause that would come under the name of
original package doctrine --
MS. SULLIVAN: Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- which meant that the foreign
liquor has to be treated better than domestic liquor.
Now, he's thinking, "Why is that? What is that package
doctrine?" And the answer is, the dormant Commerce Clause
-- it's part of the dormant Commerce Clause -- the dormant
Commerce Clause is the implication from the existence of
the commerce power in the Constitution. So if we have an
amendment that says "that aspect of the dormant Commerce
Clause doesn't apply," that means the dormant Commerce
Clause doesn't apply, because you can't divide the dormant
Commerce Clause into six different parts, or even two.
MS. SULLIVAN: But Justice --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, maybe -- I think that's
how he's reasoning.
MS. SULLIVAN: But --
JUSTICE BREYER: And if he is, and even if he
isn't, why isn't that right?
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, the Young's
Market language permitting state discrimination is,
indeed, broad, but it's been superceded by 40 years of
this Court's jurisprudence harmonizing the Twenty-First
Amendment with the rest of the Constitution. Remember,
Justice Brandeis, in Young's Market, didn't even think the
Equal Protection Clause applied to liquor imports, a
position that's inconsistent with Craig against Boren.
And nobody would suggest today that equal protection
permits a state to import only from male-owned wineries or
only import wine from white-owned wineries.
So there -- the 40 years of jurisprudence --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But Craig against Boren was --
MS. SULLIVAN: -- has been --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- had nothing to do with the
Commerce Clause.
MS. SULLIVAN: Correct, Your Honor, but if -- if
there were a law -- the states are claiming that any law
governing --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Nothing to do with
importation, either.
MS. SULLIVAN: But the dormant Commerce Clause
reflects a fundamental structural principle that is every
bit as much a part of the Constitution as the Equal
Protection Clause upheld in Craig v. Boren. Indeed this
Court, in cases from McCulloch to the Eleventh Amendment
cases and state sovereignty cases, has recognized that a
principle of the Constitution is no less fundamental
because it is a structural implication of the text. So
the dormant Commerce Clause stands on the same footing as
the affirmative power of Congress and on -- it's the same
footing as the Equal Protection Clause at issue --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think Congress --
MS. SULLIVAN: -- in Craig v. Boren --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- could enact a statute
authorizing the states to do just what they've done here?
MS. SULLIVAN: Absolutely, but it has not. And
the Wilson Act -- to go back to Justice Souter's question
and Justice Ginsburg's question -- Congress could
authorize it as it has done, for example, in the McCarran-
Ferguson Act, allowing the states to discriminate against
out-of-state industry with respect to the industry of
insurance. It has not done so here. Webb-Kenyon did not
authorize discrimination, and the Wilson Act forbade
discrimination for just -- reasons Justice Ginsburg
described. It said you may regulate imports of liquor in
the same manner as local liquor laws. And, of course, the
purpose of Section 2 was to allow to the dry states to
keep dry by preventing all those original packages from
piling up in the railway stations and being open to
bootleggers throughout the state, undermining the dry
policies of the state. Wilson forbade discrimination.
Web Kenyan didn't authorize it.
And in Congress' most recent articulation of its
view of the harmony between the Twenty-First Amendment and
the rest of the Constitution, the Twenty-First Amendment
Enforcement Act, passed in 2000, enacted in 2000, Congress
has a rules-of-construction section that says, "We view
any state plea to the federal courts to enforce their laws
as reflecting the jurisprudence of this court." And, in
fact, floor debate on that rules-of-construction section
reflected allusions to Bacchus, Healy, and the other cases
that said dormant commerce -- the negative implications of
the Commerce Clause, no less than the Equal Protection
Clause or the Due Process Clause or the Establishment
Clause, constrain the states in their regulation of
importation of liquor.
So with all respect to Justice Brandeis, Justice
Breyer, the Young's Market statements about discrimination
have been superceded.
What New York and Michigan have done here is say
that one set of exceptions apply only to in-state
producers, just as Connecticut, in Healy, said, "If you
just sell beer within our state, you don't have to face
price ceilings that you have to face if you do business
over in Massachusetts or Rhode Island." Just as in
Bacchus, the -- you struck down a decision -- an excise
tax exemption that said, "If you're an importer of liquor,
you have to pay an excise tax, but if you're a local
producer of locally produced wine and spirits, you get out
of that restriction."
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, we've got one difference
from Bacchus, because the claim that's being made here,
which I gather was not made, or made seriously, in
Bacchus, is there really is a need for differential
treatment for purposes of enforcement. Go back to the
enforcement of the tax law.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice --
JUSTICE SOUTER: How are we supposed -- what
standard are we supposed to use to judge that argument?
And, by that standard, how good is the argument?
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Souter, we believe the
standard should be strict scrutiny, though there must be a
necessity to serve --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Because --
MS. SULLIVAN: -- a legitimate --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- it's facial discrimination.
MS. SULLIVAN: Because it's facial
discrimination. It's absolutely undisputed. Michigan --
in fact, Michigan state concedes that they have flatly
banned out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to
consumers. There's no question that this is facially
discriminatory. But even if the standard were a more
deferential one in which all the state needed to show was
a reasonable need for discrimination, it can't come close
to doing that here. Neither Michigan nor New York has
shown that the facial discrimination here is necessary to
protect minors or to protect the collection of taxes.
Let's start with minors. The Michigan claim
that it's protecting against under-18 sales is belied by
the fact that Michigan is allowing 40 Michigan wineries
and, at last count, 7500 Michigan retailers to deliver
directly to consumers. The way to protect my -- so just
as in Craig v. Boren, the exception for young women to
drink 3.2 beer, as opposed to young men, belied the
state's interest in temperance. So the pattern of
exceptions here that Michigan has created belies any
notion that it's protecting under-18-year-olds from
drinking. And, of course --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But what about audits for
revenue --
MS. SULLIVAN: On revenue, the nondiscriminatory
means that's available to the state that Michigan and New
York have not shown any reason to reject -- 26 states have
adopted some version of this -- is to require an out-of-
state winery to get a permit. And that's a -- Justice
Breyer, one thing that's still left of Brandeis. You can
require a permit from an out-of-state winery, which would
be unusual to acquire from widgets or milk. But you can
require a permit, and, as a condition of the permit,
Justice Souter. The out-of-state winery has to agree to
submit to the state's jurisdiction, to submit to the
state's tax jurisdiction.
And, Justice Kennedy, whether or not Quill would
permit taxation if you were simply sending by common
carrier, our clients want to -- want to pay taxes, want to
sign up for permits, want to play on a --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --
MS. SULLIVAN: -- level playing field --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- well, they do today, I'm
sure, but --
[Laughter.]
MS. SULLIVAN: But, Justice Souter, to -- look
at the experience --
JUSTICE SOUTER: They -- you say they don't want
to go to California to do an audit.
MS. SULLIVAN: They certainly don't, Justice
Souter, but New Hampshire is a state that has actually --
your own state is a state that has on its Web site a set
of out-of-state wineries. It requires that they keep and
supply sales records on a monthly basis, that they keep
those records for three years --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe we're getting ripped off.
MS. SULLIVAN: I --
[Laughter.]
MS. SULLIVAN: -- think New Hampshire's done
very well collecting taxes from out-of-state producers,
Justice Souter. It's a leader --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Ms. Sullivan --
MS. SULLIVAN: -- in the field.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- may I -- may I -- I just
want to clarify one point. It was just -- the question
Justice Stevens asked. It's your position that if
Michigan allows Michigan wines to be sold and possessed
and consumed, that it must also allow out-of-state wine to
be sold, possessed, and consumed. Would --
MS. SULLIVAN: That's correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That is your --
MS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Justice Kennedy.
But to go back to the physical-presence
question, Justice Souter, Michigan is not now -- Michigan
officials are not now traipsing up to the upper peninsula
and all around the state to inspect wineries. The record
is clear on that. What Michigan does is require that
wineries in Michigan send samples and records to their
offices. And the Internet actually, if anything -- the
states say that the Internet increases the danger, but the
Internet also increases, in parallel, the power of the
states to police out-of-state wineries without an in-state
presence. Just as, Justice Stevens, the Internet may make
every speaker with a PC a town crier, as you said --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Could --
MS. SULLIVAN: -- in Reno versus ACLU --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- could a state --
MS. SULLIVAN: -- so it makes every interstate
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- could a state require an
out-of-state winery to keep its books online, subject to a
password, so that, with a password, they could go in and
audit the books across the country, by wire?
MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Souter, if it were
part of a -- an agreement to a permit that the -- that the
out-of-state winery is willing to make, then there's no
extraterritorial regulation there, that would be just
fine. So, yes, the state can, through Internet, so to
speak, -- Internet monitoring, through virtual monitoring
-- do all the work it needs to do to make sure that the
out-of-state winery is paying taxes.
And, by the way, Michigan does not collect
taxes, Justice Kennedy, through the distributors.
Michigan collects taxes from the wineries, whether they're
in-state or whether they're out-of-state wine shippers.
So Michigan can give no justification for why out-of-state
wineries have to go through the distributors for tax
purposes. They're not using the distributors as their
tax-collection agents now.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Commerce Clause, in effect,
protects consumers in states from entrenched business
interests that want to have protectionism, and you're --
you object to that and invoke the Commerce Clause to do
it. Under that rationale, aren't all the California
reciprocity laws invalid, as well?
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, reciprocity laws
-- yet -- possibly. They may be a necessary requirement
now that so many states are closed to states. They may be
a necessary mechanism for some states trying to get wines
to market in the way that the framers envisaged. It may
be a necessary, for now, to get into closed states. In a
world that we hope that you create, in which
discrimination is not allowed, they would be completely
unnecessary and possibly unconstitutional.
But to return to the key point here, Michigan
and New York may not facially discriminate in favor of
their own producers unless they can show that reasonable
nondiscriminatory alternatives are unavailable. And here,
Justice Souter, on any standard of heightened scrutiny,
they have not come close to making that kind of showing,
because there are all these other means -- means that have
been recognized by the 26 states that don't discriminate,
means that have been proven in states from New Hampshire
to Virginia, means that are not based on facial
discrimination. It's the discrimination that has to be
shown to --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just --
MS. SULLIVAN: -- be necessary here.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- be sure I heard your answer
to Justice Kennedy correctly. You'd concede that the
reciprocity laws are all unconstitutional?
MS. SULLIVAN: Not -- they are subject to
heightened scrutiny because they discriminate against out-
of-staters in a way that you could not -- for example, in
New Energy, you said that you can't have a preference for
-- you can't have a discrimination in Ohio in reciprocity
for Indiana. Reciprocity laws normally do violate the
principle of dormant Commerce Clause invalidation.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And you contend that they do
-- the liquor reciprocity laws, all of them are
unconstitutional.
MS. SULLIVAN: Not -- we contend that they would
be subject to strict scrutiny, and they could be upheld if
the state could show that they are closely tailored in a
JUSTICE STEVENS: They can -- that they can be
MS. SULLIVAN: -- way that these laws are not.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- upheld by making a showing
that you say is virtually impossible to make.
MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, that's not before,
and if there were other reasons --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I think it is --
MS. SULLIVAN: -- the state could --
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- it is an interesting
question as to whether that's a -- that's a -- you know,
that's a necessary consequence of this decision, in your
view.
you to reach the question of whether there are other state
defenses in other cases. The justifications the states
have given here are so terribly weak in relation to their
discriminatory laws that you should strike down these
laws, you should invalidate them, you should affirm the
judgement of the Sixth Circuit and reverse the judgements
of the Second Circuit.
Thank you very much.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Sullivan.
Mr. Casey.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1116 and 03-1120
Mr. Casey: Justice Stevens, and may it please
the Court:
For more than 70 years, the Twenty-First
Amendment has permitted states to restrict the importation
and delivery of alcohol by out-of-state vendors. There
are substantial differences between licensed in-state
vendors of alcohol and out-of-state vendors that are not
subject to the full extent of state regulatory and taxing
powers. Because of those differences, Michigan requires
that sales, including direct shipment of alcohol, be
performed only by licensed, strictly regulated, in-state
vendors. This importation regulation is a power expressly
conferred by the text of the Twenty-First Amendment. It's
consistent with the entire history of alcohol regulation
in this country, and it's consistent with this Court's
jurisprudence interpreting the Twenty-First Amendment --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now the Bacchus case cuts
against you, to some extent.
MR. CASEY: The Bacchus case was a very unique
situation that we believe is not in any way controlling in
the present case. It was not an importation case; it was
an exemption from a state excise tax on wholesalers for
alcohol that was already within the state's stream of
commerce.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I think what's
fairly implied in Justice O'Connor's question, you have to
look at the language of Bacchus, and the language of
Bacchus, in effect, restored the anti-discrimination
component of the Commerce Clause to liquor control. I
think that's a fair and necessary reading of the case.
Now --
MR. CASEY: I disagree that that is a necessary
reading --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I know it --
MR. CASEY: -- of the case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- involved pineapple wine and
all that. I know that, but --
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what we're talking about is
the language of the Court in that case.
MR. CASEY: Correct, but you're -- you have to
understand that language in light of the actual context.
There, the state did not even assert a Twenty-First
Amendment defense.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you have to
understand Young in the light of its context, where there
was no discrimination --
MR. CASEY: There was discrimination in Young,
Your Honor, and I'd like to get to that. But to focus on
Bacchus for a moment, the state never asserted the Twenty-
First amendment, and it was undisputed --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the question was
before the Court, because the dissent certainly raised the
question.
MR. CASEY: Correct. And we have suggested, in
our brief, that the Bacchus case is distinguishable and
not controlling here. We have also suggested that Bacchus
was incorrectly decided. We can prevail in this case
without overruling Bacchus, but we have suggested that --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, why don't you focus on
that? Because it's a little hard to plan on overruling
that case.
[Laughter.]
MR. CASEY: Well --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So why don't you at least
address how you would distinguish Bacchus? Because there
is a lot of language in there that cuts against your
position.
MR. CASEY: The only justification for the
statute in Bacchus was what the Court characterized as
"mere protectionism." That's not the situation with the
Michigan statute. Again, the Michigan statute involves
the paradigm -- or the quintessential Twenty-First
Amendment power of regulating importation; it's not an --
attacks on alcohol that's already an exemption from a tax
for two particular products.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no -- I mean, that --
MR. CASEY: Do you --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that rather lengthy
statement you made earlier, that the Bacchus case didn't
involve the importation of alcohol. But it did. I mean,
the only reason that the in-state exemption was held to be
unconstitutional was because you were treating out-of-
state sellers differently. How can you possibly say that
MR. CASEY: It was treating --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the case didn't involve it?
MR. CASEY: -- it was treating two particular
items of in-state production differently than all other
in-state items and out-of-state items; but it was a
taxation issue, not an importation issue. And as the
Court said in Bacchus and in Capital Cities, the correct
analysis in the -- in evaluating this kind of case is to
determine, first, whether the activity of the regulation
at issue is an exercise of a power conferred by the
Twenty-First Amendment --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why don't we focus on
the Court's rationale, which was stated very concisely by
Justice White. He said, "Hawaii's discriminatory tax
cannot stand." And then he said, "Whatever you can say
about the Twenty-First Amendment, one thing is certain,
the central purpose was not to empower the states to favor
local liquor industries by erecting barriers to
competition." That was this Court's explanation for
ruling the way it did, even though there was this infant
industry of pineapple whatever.
MR. CASEY: That was the first stage of the
Court's analysis. The Court went on to say it was not
supported by any clear concern of the Twenty-First
Amendment in combating the evils of an unrestricted
traffic in liquor --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, your opponents have said
that there isn't any clear countervailing interest here.
They're saying you can't claim you're protecting kids,
because you're selling to the kids at home; there's no
serious audit-collection problem; and the other regulatory
interests -- they didn't say this, but are, sort of, gauzy
the way they're stated. I mean, they're saying that, by a
process of elimination, what you get down to is nothing
but discrimination and protectionism. What is -- what is
your answer to that? Where is --
MR. CASEY: We --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the substantial interest?
MR. CASEY: -- we disagree wholeheartedly with
that. The Michigan --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I know, but --
MR. CASEY: -- the Michigan regulations do
promote the state's interest in temperance. They do give
the state a better --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you -- I mean, you say
that, but how? The very activity that you don't want them
to engage in, you're engaging in, or your local wineries
are engaging in, for example.
MR. CASEY: But the key is, with an in-state
licensee, the state has the ability to enforce against
that licensee, to inspect, to punish the licensee --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do we --
MR. CASEY: -- to hold them accountable.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- do we have a record of what
the state is doing with respect to its in-state licensees,
indicating what it could not do effectively to out-of-
staters? What do we have in the record?
MR. CASEY: The record in this case consisted of
a small number of affidavits, answers to interrogatories,
some surveys that were submitted as exhibits to motions
for summary judgement. Both sides submitted that type of
evidence. The District Court decided this was a question
of law, and specifically said that he did not consider any
of the factual evidence. So the record --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, should --
MR. CASEY: -- was not fully developed.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- should we send it back for
-- if we disagree with the rationale, should one or the
other of these cases go back for evidence on what, in
fact, the state is doing in relation to its in-state
licensees and evidence that it could not effectively do
the same with respect to out-of-staters?
MR. CASEY: Yes, if --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And what would you show? What
do you, in effect -- make an offer of proof.
MR. CASEY: We would show that the Michigan
requirement limiting sales and direct shipping to in-state
licensees is required because the state only has effective
enforcement authority over in-state licensees. But --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but wait a minute. You
-- it was suggested that the state could require a license
of an out-of-state supplier, and that that license could
be conditioned upon submission to Michigan's jurisdiction
in all respects. Is that not feasible?
MR. CASEY: Michigan does have a current license
for out-state seller of wine. You know, these players --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But could you not require
submission to --
MR. CASEY: We --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- Michigan's jurisdiction
for all purposes of enforcement?
MR. CASEY: Certainly, we could pass a law to
that effect. The problem is --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And if you -- if you did that,
could you require, as I suggested of Counsel on the other
side, that you -- that, as a condition of the licensing,
that the business records of these companies be placed in
some secure online fashion, that, with a password, you
could get into and do an audit across the continent just
as readily as you could do an audit next door? Could
Michigan not do that?
MR. CASEY: But there is no guarantee that such
an audit would be just the same as an audit of an in-state
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask, once we
accept the proposition -- I think this is the necessary
reading of Bacchus -- that the Commerce Clause applies to
liquor and prevents discrimination, it seems to me it's
just like any other commodity -- food, milk, et cetera --
and, in this case, you have a very substantial burden to
show that this discriminatory treatment is justified --
maybe strict scrutiny, maybe heightened scrutiny. And
this trial has occurred. You have had that opportunity.
I don't see why you have a right to go back.
MR. CASEY: Despite the lack of evidence in the
record and the fact that District Court did not consider
that evidence, the Sixth Circuit dismissed all of those
claims of the state and remanded for entry of judgement on
the Plaintiffs without giving us an opportunity to develop
that record. I also want to say --
JUSTICE SCALIA: See, I don't -- I don't
understand. Didn't you have an opportunity to develop the
record? I mean, this was --
MR. CASEY: There was --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a discriminatory matter. It
was your burden to show that whatever discrimination
existed -- assuming that we find the law the way Bacchus
seemed to say it is -- it was your burden to show that
there was some justification for that discrimination.
MR. CASEY: There --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You had your chance to show it.
MR. CASEY: -- there was evidence in the record.
There were affidavits from Michigan enforcement officials
about stings, about problem with enforcing --
JUSTICE SCALIA: All right, well --
MR. CASEY: -- against Internet --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- tell us what those -- what
that material is, and if we find that material sustains
your burden, that's fine, you win; and if it doesn't, you
lose. I don't know why we have to let you go back and --
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and retry the case.
MR. CASEY: Our key position is that before you
get to that kind of evidentiary burden, the legal question
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I'm interested in.
You win, either way. If it -- maybe if the Commerce
Clause -- dormant Commerce Clause discrimination principle
applies, you win, if we scrutinize strictly and say you
have a good justification. Whether you do or not, I guess
I'll find out from reading the record, but I'm more
interested in the first half, which is -- doesn't apply at
all.
Now, your opponent said, in response to my
pointing to Brandeis on this, that to support you, as to
precedent, Bacchus. Young's Market isn't any good
anymore. As to concept, you can divide the dormant
Commerce Clause into a -- you have to favor out-of-state
principle, which was the original package doctrine, which
has long since disappeared, and the anti-discrimination
principle, which hasn't disappeared. And her third part,
implicit, is, historically, this whole Section 2 was aimed
at the original package part; there is not a word in any
brief I saw that suggests any motive in Section 2 to get
rid of the anti-discrimination principle. I haven't found
a word in support on your side on that. So she says, "Put
those three things together, and we win." That's her
point. Now, what's your response?
MR. CASEY: We disagree with that entire
position. The text --
JUSTICE BREYER: I know you do.
[Laughter.]
MR. CASEY: -- the text of the Twenty-First
Amendment -- the text of the Twenty-First Amendment gives
states the right to control imports. The history of the
Twenty-First Amendment in the Webb-Kenyon Act clearly
demonstrate -- the purpose of the Webb-Kenyon Act was to
eliminate alcohol shipments from --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think --
MR. CASEY: -- the Commerce Clause.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that Michigan can prohibit
the importation of any wine, but still allow its own wine
to be produced, sold, and consumed?
MR. CASEY: Yes. That's precisely what
situation was with --
JUSTICE BREYER: I know you do, but the
principle of Webb-Kenyon, which was enacted when the
Wilson Act was already there -- very clear -- is to stop
the original package doctrine, stop favoritism of the out-
of-state liquor shipment, which meant, in a dry state, you
had to sell less. I mean, that's what it's there for. I
didn't find a word, in other words, contrary to what I've
just said; and if there are such words, now is the time to
point them to me -- to point them out.
MR. CASEY: The title of the Webb-Kenyon Act is,
"It is in -- an act divesting intoxicating liquors of
their interstate character in certain cases. The clear
intent of the Webb-Kenyon Act was to remove alcohol from
the Commerce Clause. The Constitution -- the Twenty-First
Amendment constitutionalized that Commerce Clause
framework." That's what this Court said in Craig v.
Boren. Craig v. Boren also said, "The Twenty-First
Amendment creates an exception to the operation of -- the
normal operation of the dormant Commerce Clause."
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then you are asking us,
I guess, not only to reject Bacchus, but who was the first
one that said that the Commerce Clause remains alive and
well? Was it Justice Stewart? And I forgot which case it
was. It was --
MR. CASEY: That may be. The Commerce Clause
remains alive and well, but the Commerce Clause --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the context of alcoholic
beverages.
MR. CASEY: In the context of powers expressly
conferred upon the states by the Twenty-First Amendment,
that's an exception to the operation -- the normal
operation of the dormant Commerce Clause. Commerce Clause
has to be read in light of the Twenty-First Amendment,
just as the Twenty-First Amendment has to be read in light
of the Commerce Clause and other provisions of the
Constitution.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's a different
argument than the one you made before, which seems to be
saying the Twenty-First Amendment trumps, not that the two
have to be harmonized.
MR. CASEY: When you read the two in light of
each other, the purposes of each, it is clear that the
purpose of the Twenty-First Amendment was to remove
alcohol from interstate commerce as a constitutional
matter, to prevent Congress from tampering with it in the
future, to give the judgement to the states as to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you --
MR. CASEY: -- the necessity for --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you say further than that;
you say the purpose was to allow that the states
discriminate in favor of home industry, if it chooses.
MR. CASEY: That is one of the purposes, yes.
In that -- in the case that was decided immediately after
the Young's Market, Mahoney, and Indianapolis Brewing, the
Court said, "Discrimination is permissible in this narrow
context, where the state is acting pursuant to its Twenty-
First Amendment powers and regulating importation of
alcohol."
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But that gets us back to
Bacchus and what to make of that.
MR. CASEY: I -- as I indicated, I don't believe
Bacchus overrules those cases; it didn't even cite most of
those cases. But --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the dissent seemed to
think so --
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- didn't it?
MR. CASEY: That's correct. But, as I said, we
believe Bacchus is distinguishable, because that was mere
protectionism, the state does have other justifications
here --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we've also said that
mere protectionism is permitted.
MR. CASEY: Mere protectionism is permitted. In
this case, if we have to present other justifications, we
have, and there are other justifications, unlike the
situation in Bacchus. So even if the Bacchus rationale is
good law, we still prevail on that.
Thank you, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Halligan?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN HALLIGAN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS IN 03-1274
MS. HALLIGAN: Justice Stevens, and may it
please the Court:
In answer to your question first, Justice
Breyer, the Twenty-First Amendment does not propose a
nondiscriminatory ban. The Court rejected that position,
not just in Young's Market and Mahoney in Indianapolis,
but also in Clark Distilling, the case in which the Court
upheld the constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Act,
itself. It held that the Webb-Kenyon Act operated to
remove any immunity that had been conferred by the dormant
Commerce Clause. Bacchus is not to the contrary. In
North Dakota, which follows Bacchus, the Court relied
again on Young's Market to say that the states could
impose different rules on out-of-state vendors where they
were necessary to protect the integrity --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you -- do you take the
position that your colleague on your same side takes, that
a state can permit only the sale, consumption, and -- of
its own wines, and bar all out-of-state wines?
MS. HALLIGAN: The express terms of the Twenty-
First Amendment would allow that if -- particularly if it
were necessary to advance the concerns of the Twenty-First
Amendment. For example --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, don't --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- don't put in the
qualifications.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just for local
protectionism.
MS. HALLIGAN: Simply for mere protectionism?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's just for local
protectionism. We want to promote our wines, and not
anybody else's.
MS. HALLIGAN: The terms of the amendment would
allow that, but I don't think the Court needs to explore
the outer parameters of the Twenty-First --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm trying to understand
what your --
MS. HALLIGAN: -- the Twenty-First --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what your theory is. And
so you are in agreement with your colleague that this
could be done, if New York chose. You can only drink New-
York-grown wines in -- sell and consume -- in the state of
New York.
MS. HALLIGAN: It could be done, but that
question really isn't presented here, because --
JUSTICE BREYER: But could Congress pass a law
forbidding it?
MS. HALLIGAN: That's a difficult question,
because --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. All right. But I need
an answer to it.
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE BREYER: Because, you see, what's going
to come next is, if you say yes, I'm going to say, "Well,
didn't it pass that law with the Wilson Act?"
MS. HALLIGAN: Let me answer both of those
questions, if I can, Your Honor. Certainly, this Court
has held, repeatedly, that the Twenty-First Amendment did
not, in any substantial way, completely repeal Congress'
affirmative power under the Commerce Clause. It said that
in Midcal and Capital Cities. But we would argue that if
Congress acted in a way which completely removed state
authority to determine whether or not alcohol could be
sold and the terms under which it could be sold -- for
example, if Congress said all states must be dry -- then
we would argue that the Twenty-First Amendment wouldn't
allow that, because that would completely eviscerate any
state authority.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How can that be? I mean, if
this is a constitutional elimination of the Commerce
Clause, how can Congress bring it back in simply by
enacting a statute?
MS. HALLIGAN: The legislative history makes
clear that the Twenty-First Amendment was intended to
eliminate the impediments posed by the dormant Commerce
Clause and authorize states to regulate it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you want us to read
it by its terms. It doesn't say anything about the
dormant Commerce Clause. If we read it absolutely the way
one of your arguments wants us to do, surely it excludes
Congress.
MS. HALLIGAN: By terms of our --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you don't want us to read it
absolutely.
MS. HALLIGAN: Your Honor, I don't think that --
again, I don't think that you need to decide those
questions in this case. This case goes to what's at the
very core of the Twenty-First Amendment, whether states
can decide who can sell liquor to their citizens and
whether or not states --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it also goes to the very
core of the Commerce Clause. And there are really two
classifications of dormant Commerce Clause cases. One is
-- and I think it's an improper use of the term "dormant
clause" -- is where there's discrimination. Only the
Congress can allow discrimination against out-of-state
products. That's one whole classification. And that's
what's -- and that's what's involved here.
MS. HALLIGAN: North Dakota indicates otherwise,
I believe, Your Honor. In North Dakota, this Court said
that, because, when alcohol flows across the border, it
poses unique risks to the regulatory regime, because the
state can't bring the alcohol within the full extent of
its regulatory and supervisory powers, that it may be
appropriate and necessary for states to impose unique
rules on out-of-state vendors. In North Dakota, the Court
did not say --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that's fine. And the
other side isn't denying that here, that if, you know,
they're -- discrimination means treating out-of-state
people differently without good reason.
MS. HALLIGAN: But there is good reason --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if you're willing to --
okay, if you're willing to acknowledge that, then we're
halfway there and we're just arguing about whether there
is good reason here or not.
MS. HALLIGAN: There is good reason here, Your
Honor. What's critical about New York's law, as well as
Michigan's law, is that it requires that any alcohol
vendor have a physical presence in the state. And that's
important for a couple of reasons. The state can't
meaningfully oversee traffic in alcohol with an out-of-
state entity. Petitioner suggested --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What is it doing with the in-
state entities? I mean, one of the claims is that nobody
is posting officers outside the in-state wineries, no
one's making substantial physical audits of in-state
wineries. Is that wrong?
MS. HALLIGAN: It is wrong, Your Honor. It's
certainly not the case that we have an SLA inspector
outside every entity that sells liquor. That would not be
possible. But it is true that the state liquor authority
can, and does, physically inspect the premises. They do
so to determine whether --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What do they inspect them for?
Their books, I suppose.
MS. HALLIGAN: Well, more than that, and this is
why the physical presence is important and why the
Internet hypothetical that Your Honor raised would not --
would not satisfy the state's concerns. What the state
can do is, it can go onto a premises, and it can count
whether the bottles on the shelves of that premises match
the records. That's the best way to detect whether or not
there is evasion. Because if you have --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And is there a record that the
state is doing that?
MS. HALLIGAN: There is not clear evidence in
the record with respect to that -- to that level of
detail, but that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't that the end of
that issue, then? I mean, it is your burden, isn't it?
MS. HALLIGAN: Your Honor, there is material in
the McKeon affidavit, which is in the Joint Appendix --
Mr. McKeon is the Chair of the state liquor authority --
but it's also the case that to suggest that because there
is some option out there -- and there's no firm evidence
that a less prescriptive rule would, in fact, satisfy the
state's concerns in preventing diversion and tax evasion -
-- but the possibility that's there's some rule out there,
because other states have adopted more lax rules, is to
treat alcohol like any other product. And the Twenty-
First Amendment reflects a consensus by this nation that
alcohol is unique, that it should not be open to --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the Twenty-First
Amendment at least recognizes that alcohol can be treated
as unique, and the issue here is whether you're really
doing that in a way that supports your claim of interest.
MS. HALLIGAN: Yes --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And, so far, the one specific
thing I've heard from you is that state inspectors do go
on winery premises, and they count bottles, and they see
if they match what's on the written record.
MS. HALLIGAN: They also draw on the assistance
of local law enforcement. And this is also --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if that's --
MS. HALLIGAN: -- set forth --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if that's really what New
York's concern is, then why does New York say, "Ah, but
out-of-staters, if only you establish an office here --
not a winery; an office -- you can operate, and you can
make the direct sales from that office, and even in" -- I
think your brief told us that, well, these small wineries,
out-of-state wineries, haven't got all that much to worry
about, because, after all, they could join together -- a
group of them could open an office. Now, that office,
owned by a group of out-of-state vintners is not going to
have bottles on the shelf, is it?
MS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor, it would.
That's -- the state laws requires that any licensed winery
have a government-bonded storehouse or ware-room --
storehouse -- storeroom or warehouse, pardon me --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, isn't the --
MS. HALLIGAN: The reason for that is because
physical products --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you envision this
combination of small wineries? You said that in-state
establishments might be jointly maintained by out-of-state
wineries.
MS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor. The state
liquor authority has not issued any regulations on this,
but presumably what they would say is, you could share a
space, provided that the physical property of each winery,
the bottles, is segregated so that the states can come in
and check whether or not each winery's products conform
with their records.
There are other reasons why a physical presence
is important, as well. First of all, the state draws on
local law enforcement extensively to identify illegal
activities, and that would not be possible with any entity
located out-of-state. Additionally --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What illegal -- I'm sorry --
you've got to be specific. What illegal activities?
Selling to minors?
MS. HALLIGAN: It could be selling to minors,
but it could also simply be sale out of an unlicensed
premises, where you are selling outside the proper hours
of sale, or sale outside of the three-tier system --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but if licensed premises
don't serve a state interest, then you can't require a
licensed premises, so that argument doesn't get too far.
MS. HALLIGAN: But, Your Honor, the principle
that having entities that sell liquor be licensed, is one
that is at the heart, not just at the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How does -- how does requiring
them to have an in-state office somehow prevent them from
shipping to minors from out of state --
MS. HALLIGAN: It --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- or from shipping to
consumers from out of state without paying you their tax?
MS. HALLIGAN: It --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How does the opening of an --
MS. HALLIGAN: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- an office in New York State
at all prevent that?
MS. HALLIGAN: It can't prevent it a hundred
percent, but no --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It can't prevent it at all.
MS. HALLIGAN: Your Honor, it can deter it, and
it can deter it significantly, because, first of all,
there is a much more significant opportunity to identify
the illegal activities; and, secondly, if a retailer or a
wholesaler or a manufacturer knows that, that operates as
a powerful deterrent --
JUSTICE BREYER: What did --
JUSTICE SOUTER: We seem to be talking -- may I
just ask one -- we seem to be talking about two different
things. Justice Scalia was assuming that, if you have the
license and some in-state warehouse, you can ship from
outside. And I -- is that the assumption? Or is your
argument that New York can require -- does require the in-
state warehouse, and you can ship into -- in New York, you
can ship only from that warehouse?
MS. HALLIGAN: To be clear, the state has not
issued regulations that specifically address that point,
because --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So the -- we don't know yet.
MS. HALLIGAN: We don't know. But in talking
with the state liquor authority, they have made it clear
that their intent would be to require that the liquor come
first to the in-state premises --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, even if -- I'm willing to
assume that. How does that guarantee that the out-of-
state winery will not, in violation of New York State law,
ship directly to minors or ship directly to consumers,
just simply bypassing its cache of wine in New York?
MS. HALLIGAN: There is no guarantee, Your
Honor, but there is never any guarantee --
JUSTICE SCALIA: There's no guarantee.
MS. HALLIGAN: -- that people won't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't -- it doesn't enable
you to enforce your law any more rigorously than without
having a requirement for a local office.
MS. HALLIGAN: That, I would respectfully
disagree with. It does operate as a powerful deterrent
and --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, your argument there is
that --
MS. HALLIGAN: -- as an investigative aid.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if they break the law, you
can shut down the warehouse; whereas, you can't
effectively do that if the warehouse is in California.
Isn't that your point?
MS. HALLIGAN: That's one of the points, but
also that we're much more likely to be able to identify
the illegal activities in the first place. The suggestion
that we would send inspectors to California or any other
place to look at books and count bottles is completely
infeasible. And the Twenty-First Amendment was intended
to allow states to deal with the regulatory challenges
that are posed when liquor comes across the border. If we
had to demonstrate that there was a hundred-percent
compliance, then we couldn't have any regulation at all.
That's not, I would submit, a --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, to what --
MS. HALLIGAN: -- reasonable measure.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to what extent does New
York take account of, say, the rigorous regulation in the
states from which this wine is coming? You say we must do
this to police for all kinds of things. But don't other
states -- California, Virginia -- don't they have laws
that their local wineries must meet?
MS. HALLIGAN: They --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is New York just saying,
"We're going to treat this thing as though it's totally
unregulated, anyway"?
MS. HALLIGAN: We're not suggesting that, Your
Honor. What we are suggesting is that relying on other
states to enforce law violations in New York State is not
a very feasible alternative. Additionally, there are 33
states that have agreed with New York, a number of whom
are states that have either reciprocal or unrestricted
shipping statutes, and said to this Court, "Please do not
prohibit the kinds of laws that are at issue in New York
and Michigan." So it's obviously important to the
regulators in those states, as well.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the states that do a
allow shipment from out of state? They don't care about
their --
MS. HALLIGAN: I can't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How many are there that allow
shipment from out-of-state wineries?
MS. HALLIGAN: I believe that the current number
is 26 states. I certainly can't speak to the regulatory
motivations of each of those states, or the reasons why
those laws might have been passed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It certainly suggests that what
-- that what you're arguing is not essential to the
state's enforcement of its alcohol laws.
MS. HALLIGAN: Well, a number of those states
have, in fact, joined New York and Michigan in asking the
Court not to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: States don't like federal
regulation --
MS. HALLIGAN: -- restrict that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- of any sort, of course. I
know that.
[Laughter.]
MS. HALLIGAN: Your Honor, I think that all the
Twenty-First Amendment requires the states to demonstrate
is that the regulatory regime that they have chosen has
some relationship to their goals of protecting the
integrity of the state's system. And that's certainly
what the Court suggested in North Dakota.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not sure. When you
have facial discrimination against out-of-state products,
I think you're -- the bar is a little higher than that.
MS. HALLIGAN: Well, that was the case in North
Dakota, as well. In North Dakota, the state imposed
regulations on out-of-state vendors that were extremely
onerous, so onerous that some vendors said they wouldn't
ship products at all. That was alcohol that was not even
destined for consumption within the state; but on a
federal enclave. And the mere risk of diversion into
unregulated and unlawful channels was enough to allow the
state to impose those discriminatory rules. The same is
true here.
Justice O'Connor, you also asked about Bacchus,
as well, and I would like to take a moment to address
that.
Bacchus is distinguishable in several ways.
First of all, Bacchus was a tax. And while we would argue
that taxes could be used to further states' interest in
suppressing consumption, for example, it is certainly not
at the heart of the -- of the Twenty-First Amendment in
the way that the direct regulation of alcohol across the
border is.
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but if you can't grant a
tax exemption -- and it seems to me, a fortiori -- you
can't grant a prohibition about importing at all.
MS. HALLIGAN: I, respectfully, would disagree
with that, Your Honor. If you can't address the alcohol
that flows across the border, which was precisely why the
Twenty-First Amendment was enacted, as well as Webb-
Kenyon, because the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm suggesting a tax on
imports is less restrictive than a prohibition on imports.
MS. HALLIGAN: Well, we would certainly, you
know, welcome the authority to do both, but importation is
what is at the heart of the Twenty-First Amendment.
Bacchus is also different, because, there, the state made
no effort whatsoever to defend the statute with reference
to any concerns related to the Twenty-First Amendment.
And Bacchus --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And according to the District
Court, in this very case, the State Attorney General
conceded that New York's measure allowing direct sales by
in-state wineries was designed to benefit local farmers.
MS. HALLIGAN: That was an off-the-cuff remark
by a single attorney, Your Honor, and that can't be taken
as dispositive, given the state's vigorous defense of this
statute. It also was regarding a provision that is not
even directly before the Court right now which confers no
different shipment privileges than are conferred on any
winery, whether in-state or out-of-state, that would
obtain a license to sell in New York.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Halligan.
MS. HALLIGAN: Thank you, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Bolick, you have, let's
see, about four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CLINT BOLICK
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1274
MR. BOLICK: Thank you, Justice Stevens. Three
very brief points.
There his a panoply of tools available to states
to police out-of-state wineries in direct shipping, as the
Federal Trade Commission has recognized. They can, if
they issue a permit, revoke that permit. And New York has
authority to issue such permits under Section 105-9. The
Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act, for which the
liquor distributors and states lobbied very hard, gives
injunction authority in the home federal courts. And, of
course, the federal agency, the Tax and Trade Bureau, can
revoke a permit if state law is violated. In the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Who's going to count the
bottles?
[Laughter.]
MR. BOLICK: Your Honor, the state -- the
Federal Government is able to count those, but the
evidence is that they don't. And that goes back to a
question, I believe, Justice Souter asked. In the
Michigan case, a question was posed in an interrogatory,
"What enforcement by -- is done of in-state wineries." In
that regard, the answer was, "None."
JUSTICE BREYER: How do you count bottles? I
would have thought the consumers have all the bottles.
[Laughter.]
MR. BOLICK: That's exactly right. And,
certainly in the directly shipping context in-state, that
is emphatically the case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think they were referring to
full bottles. I guess --
[Laughter.]
MR. BOLICK: With direct shipping --
JUSTICE STEVENS: They've all been drinking --
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- to arbitrators.
MR. BOLICK: With direct shipping, Justice
Scalia, we can personalize things.
In terms of the Bacchus case, as Justice
Ginsburg pointed out, New York, like Hawaii, conceded
protectionism. It is very rife in the legislative record
in 1970, when the direct shipping was extinguished. In
1995, when Governor Pataki vetoed a bill that would have
solved this problem, he said, and I quote -- and this is
in the record, the Joint -- the Second Circuit Joint
Appendix, at 442 -- he said, and I quote, "Since the vast
majority of this country's wines are produced in
California, I believe that this bill would inevitably lead
to a significant increase in mail-order wines from that
state into New York. This increase could, in turn, lead
to a decrease in sales for New York liquor stores and
their distributors, and shrink New York wineries' market
share. That is protectionism."
And, finally, the notion that small winemakers
could go to all 50 states and open offices in order to do
this -- if you could drive out to Middleburg and visit
Juanita Swedenburg's winery -- and she invites you to do
so --
[Laughter.]
MR. BOLICK: -- you will find Mrs. Swedenburg
selling wine, harvesting grapes, and bottling. This is a
ban on -- this is market foreclosure, sure and simple --
fewer than 600 wineries are represented on the stores of
New York's shelves, out of over 3,000 wineries --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The question --
MR. BOLICK: -- in the United States.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- really is whether the plain
language of the Twenty-First Amendment allows that very
protectionism.
MR. BOLICK: And I would refer you, in my brief
time remaining, to the brief, the Carter-Phillips brief
for the Napa Valley Vintners Association, the DKT Liberty
brief, which go into the history of the Twenty-First
Amendment, which was intended to restore the police power,
which did not include the power to discriminate. Our
clients cannot compete with the liquor distributors in the
political marketplace in their -- in their -- in their
home states. They can, however, compete in the economic
marketplace. The Commerce Clause protects that right,
that level playing field. The Twenty-First Amendment was
never intended to take it away.
We ask this Court, respectfully, to honor 124
years of precedent in the National Economic Union.
If there are no further questions, thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Bolick. The
case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in the
