CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

Mr. Bursch.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
No court has ever held that AEDPA and
Strickland can be satisfied by presumption based on a
silent record.  Yet that is precisely the approach the
Sixth Circuit adopted in granting habeas relief here.
The record doesn't say how attorney Toca
investigated or what advice attorney Toca gave, but
based on that record silence, the Sixth Circuit assumed
Toca was ineffective.  And under AEDPA and Strickland,
the presumptions run the opposite way.
Now, if there's one thing that the Court
takes away from the oral argument this morning, I hope
that it's -- it's this:  How upside down the Sixth
Circuit's analysis is when it says, on page 19A of the
petition appendix, that Toca was deficient because the
record contains no evidence that he advised Titlow about
elements, evidence, or sentencing exposure.
The correct question is whether the record
contains evidence that Toca did not do those things.
And that record silence is dispositive in favor of the
State on habeas review.
Now, if we could pull the curtain back and
see what really happened here, it may be the case that
Toca gave the proper advice, that he advised Titlow
about all the perils of going to trial, and that Titlow
continued to maintain her innocence.
Under Strickland, we're supposed to presume
that Toca did exactly that, especially when it's
Titlow's burden to satisfy the burden of proof, and she
failed to do that.
So I'd like to begin with our first issue,
which is AEDPA deference and the performance prong of
Strickland.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I just ask a question
about what you just said?  The record does show that
Toca came into the case very late in the day, and he
asked to have a postponement because he said, I have to
get up to speed.  I don't know anything about this case.
So Toca, himself, is saying, I'm not
acquainted with the case -- with the case.
MR. BURSCH:  Well, I don't think he's --
he's saying that, Justice Ginsburg.  He's saying I'm not
prepared for trial yet, but he says, I've got a lot of
materials here.  He goes through a very sophisticated
sentencing analysis with the -- the sentencing court in
this plea withdrawal hearing.
If you understand Michigan sentencing, if
you've got a manslaughter charge, there's a grid.  And
there's all kinds of different boxes that this could
have fit into, and he would have had to have analyzed
the evidence in order to determine that the two to five
range was appropriate for a manslaughter conviction and
to be able to then negotiate with the prosecutor about
whether that was or was not appropriate.
And so we know that -- that Toca did a lot
of work.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Was -- was the sentence that
was ultimately imposed after the trial for the
second-degree murder conviction within the guidelines --
within the Michigan guidelines?
MR. BURSCH:  Yes, it was.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What -- do you know what
those guidelines were?
MR. BURSCH:  I don't recall, but it's
something on the range of 15 to 20 years.  And when
we're talking about guidelines, it's important for the
Court to understand the difference between what the
guidelines called for, for manslaughter, and what was in
the plea agreement because Michigan's got this
indeterminate sentencing system, where you've got a
range for the lower end.
And so the plea deal was 7 to 15 years on
the lower end.  And a manslaughter conviction -- that
is, if they had gone to trial and lost for manslaughter,
the lower end was 2 years to 5 years.
And so it was entirely reasonable, from an
objective perspective, for an attorney, looking at this
record, at the time the plea was withdrawn, to say, yes,
if you want to maintain your innocence, the most likely
bad result at trial is most likely better than the plea
deal that you already have.
Sure, there's a risk that something worse
could happen, but this Court has said in Strickland and
Lafler and other places that bad predictions are not
deficient performance.
And so, really, when you get down to it,
it's really a problem with both the advice being
reasonable, but also the failure to carry the burden of
proof.  It's just the case that Titlow has not come
forward to demonstrate, as he was required to do -- she
was required to do, on the record, what Titlow -- or
what Toca did to investigate and what advice Toca
actually gave to Titlow.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When we're asking whether
the advice was reasonable, what force do we give to the
proposition that a well-counselled defendant was now
insisting that he wanted to change his plea?  And there
was only three days.  How do we –- how do we factor that in?  If --
if we look  just at what the counsel did --
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  I think that's an
important factor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- it may lead us to one
answer.  But if we know that a previously
well-counselled defendant had now changed his mind and
wanted to withdraw, how do we factor that in?
MR. BURSCH:  I think that's a significant
factor because, as you point out, before the ink was
even dry on the plea agreement, Titlow was already in
prison saying, I'm innocent, maybe I should be
withdrawing this plea, setting in motion a chain of
events that resulted in her firing the first attorney
and then hiring a second attorney.
And I don't think that the court of
appeals -- the Michigan Court of Appeals, articulated
any kind of a -- a per se rule about that -- you know,
certainly, we all understand that the ethical obligation
of the lawyer is that, if your client insists that they
want to maintain their innocence, you have to allow them
to do that.
But what the court of appeals did, at pages
100 to 101A of the petition appendix, it looked at that,
but it also looked at the other evidence.  It looked at
the Strickland presumption that Toca did his job.  And
then it says, at the very conclusion of that sentence,
based on all the proofs and arguments presented, Titlow
failed to satisfy her burden.  This instance is one part
of that.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you -- could you
explain the procedural situation before the Michigan
Court of Appeals?  There was a motion by the Respondent
for a remand to the trial court to create a record; is
that -- that correct --
MR. BURSCH:  That's correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- on the issue of
ineffective assistance of counsel?
And so the -- the question that the court of
appeals had to decide was whether the materials that
were submitted by the Respondent were sufficient to
justify the hearing.
MR. BURSCH:  That's correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And the court of appeals, I
gather, said they're not sufficient and cited, among
other things or principally, the fact that the
Respondent had claimed innocence, and that was the
reason for the -- the change of attorney.
So the issue really wasn't -- that was
before them was really not entitlement to relief, but in
the course of deciding whether there should be a remand,
they necessarily got to the issue of whether there was
an entitlement to relief.
Is that -- is that correct?  Or do I not
understand?
MR. BURSCH:  Just to be clear about Michigan
procedure, the defendant has an opportunity to ask for
what's called a Ginther hearing in Michigan, and that's
this evidentiary hearing to develop a record for an
ineffective assistance claim.
Titlow did not ask for that hearing in the
trial court.  She did ask for it in the -- the Michigan
Court of Appeals.  But under the Michigan court rules --
this is 7.211(C)(1)(a)(2) -- she was required to make a
proffer to justify that hearing on this motion to
remand.
And so the court of appeals, before it
issued its merits opinion, issues a one-sentence order
that says, that motion to remand is denied because you
have not proffered enough evidence to demonstrate that a
hearing is warranted.
And that makes sense because the only
proffer was the polygraph, the Lustig affidavit, and the
Pierson affidavit.  You know, it would be entirely
appropriate -- this often happens -- that Titlow herself
would have submitted an affidavit saying, this is what
Titlow knew -- or I'm sorry, this is what Toca knew,
this is what Toca advised, and I relied on that.
Or it sometimes is even the case, that the
previous defense counsel is willing to submit the
affidavit that says, this is what I knew, this is the
advice that I gave.  None of that was there.  And so
that's why you have this denial of the motion.
So now, in the context of that record and,
Justice Kennedy, the claim of innocence and this whole
thing being set in motion by that claim of innocence, it
was quite easy for the Michigan Court of Appeals to say
that, on the proofs presented and in light of the
Strickland presumption, there was nothing objectively
unreasonable about allowing Titlow to recall her plea.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  In just thinking about that
Michigan Court of Appeals decision, there is one sort of
troubling line in it to me.  It says, "When a defendant
proclaims his innocence, it is not objectively
unreasonable to recommend that the defendant refrain
from pleading guilty no matter how good the deal may
appear."
And one way to read this is it's a kind of
categorical rule, which says that, when the defendant
says he is innocent, basically your obligations to
properly advise him about a plea, go away.  Now, I
understand you not to read it that way.
MR. BURSCH:  Correct.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So could you tell me a
little bit about what you think of that question and why
you read the sentence the way you read the sentence?
MR. BURSCH:  Yes.  I think it would be very
difficult to defend the opinion if that was the only
sentence of analysis because we do not agree that a
simple claim of innocence by your client relieves the
attorney of any responsibility to do anything.  That's
not what happened here.
Four sentences before the sentence you just
read on page 101A, the court of appeals talks about the
Strickland presumption that the attorney is doing his or
her job.  Two sentences after that sentence you just
read, on page 102A, the Michigan Court of Appeals
specifically says, "On the proofs and arguments offered
by defendant, there is no ineffective assistance here."
And so that was part of a larger discussion
about attorneys who do their job when their clients are
claiming innocence.  And you have to put all that
together.
And I think it's significant, also, that the
Michigan Court of Appeals was giving Titlow the benefit
of the doubt here because, on page 100A, just one page
earlier, it assumes Titlow's position, that is that Toca
actually gave the advice to withdraw the plea.  We don't
even know that because we don't have credible evidence
in this record.
We don't have an affidavit from Titlow.  We
don't have an affidavit from Toca that indicates that
Toca ever gave that advice.  Again, if you could draw
the curtain back, it may very well have been, as we
assume under Strickland, that he totally and completely
advised about all the risks of trial before the plea was
withdrawn.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you clarify something
for me about habeas corpus law?
MR. BURSCH:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I have to imagine the
facts, so let's take it as a hypothetical.  That -- The U.S. --
the district attorney says, this lawyer was adequate,
and really, two factors make that obvious.  The first
factor is that the client said that she was innocent,
and taking that into account with the other things, that
could have justified, adequately, his withdrawal of the
plea and not convincing her not to.
Second, the sentence that the district
attorney wanted to give was more than a year greater
than the guidelines for manslaughter, and that could
have justified it.
Now, it writes -- the court then writes in
its opinion only the second reason and never mentions
the first.  Now, we go to habeas, and the habeas court
thinks that second reason is pretty flimsy there.  Gee,
she was exposing herself to murder, et cetera, it's
pretty flimsy.  The first isn't so bad, but they didn't
rely on it.  Okay.
So now, what is the habeas court supposed to
do?  Is -- should the -- should the defendant have gone
back to the State court first?  Is the habeas court
supposed to have its own independent hearing and make up
its own mind?
How does this work?
MR. BURSCH:  That's a delightful question.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm glad.  I would love to
know the answer.
MR. BURSCH:  And I want to start with a
record response to distinguish our case from your
hypothetical and then address the habeas question.  Your
hypothetical assumed that the State court only mentioned
one of the two reasons, and here, obviously, the court
of appeals talked about innocence.  We've discussed that
at length.
But on page 100A of the opinion, the court
of appeals also notes that the defendant moved to
withdraw her plea because the agreed-upon sentence
exceeded the sentencing guidelines range.  So they are
both here.
But assuming your hypothetical that we only
had one and not two, the question is really easy under
2254 because, so long as the decision was not a
misapplication of this Court's clearly established
precedent, there is no violation, even if their
reasoning might not have been as strong as it could have
been, had they mentioned the other reason.
So next habeas question, does the defendant
get an opportunity to have a Federal habeas hearing to
further develop the record about what happened?  And the
answer is no, because under 2254(e)(1) and (e)(2), there
is a presumption of correctness about everything that
was found in the State court system.
And there is no right to get a Federal
evidentiary hearing if you have not adequately pursued
your ability to develop the record in the State court.
And as Justice Alito has already pointed
out, it was Titlow's failure, not the State's failure,
to properly proffer evidence to get the Ginther hearing.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you make of the fact
that -- what do you make of the fact that, at the change
of plea hearing, the first attorney didn't mention the
claim of innocence, only mentioned the fact that the
sentence was above the guidelines?
MR. BURSCH:  I don't think that's
significant because those two things are not mutually
exclusive.  The defendant could believe, in her heart of
hearts, that she's innocent, and at the same time, the
attorney could acknowledge that there are facts in the
record already admitted that a reasonable jury could
conclude that you were guilty of manslaughter.
And so it would not be inconsistent for that
attorney to argue for a lower guidelines range in the
plea, and so there's really nothing inconsistent about
that.  But the important thing to understand here is
just the failure of the burden of proof.  The Sixth
Circuit is upside-down when it reads into the record's
silence ineffective assistance.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When you say the record
is silence -- silent, I am looking at the Joint
Appendix, page 295, and this is Titlow's statement.  "I
would have testified against my aunt...had I not been
persuaded to withdraw my plea agreement because an
attorney promised me he would represent me.  He told me
he could take my case to trial and win."
So that sounds like she was persuaded by
Mr. Toca to go to trial because she could win.  And he
had, at that point, not made any appraisal of the case.
MR. BURSCH:  Well, first, I have to disagree
with the premise of your question, Justice Ginsburg,
because there is no doubt that Toca made an appraisal.
He had -- you know, the quote from the plea withdrawal
hearing is "a lot of materials," and he made a very
sophisticated argument about what the guidelines range
should be, and that range was lower than the plea
actually offered.
But what you need to understand about this
testimony from Titlow right here, this was a plea for
leniency at sentencing.  This was not part of the
proffer to the Michigan Court of Appeals as part of the
motion for remand.  What -- what Titlow could have done
was submit her own affidavit or the affidavit from Toca
establishing whether this was actually true or not.
In addition, you've got to take the context
of this and juxtapose it against the other things that
Titlow was saying at this very same sentencing hearing.
And it -- it's remarkable, really, that she says both of
these things.
She says she feels sorry for her Aunt Billie
for being this manipulating and evil person and thanks
God that she did not do what Billie asked her to do.
And she says it was only because of her, Titlow, that
the truth came out.  So somehow, it's -- it's still a
claim of innocence, even after trial, even after there
has been a conviction.
If there are no further questions, I will
reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. O'Connell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. O'CONNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
There are two primary points that the United
States would like to make.  First, when evaluating
Strickland prejudice in the context of a rejected plea
offer, the statement of a convicted defendant that she
would have accepted the plea absent deficient advice
should be viewed with skepticism, and to support a
finding of causation, the statement should be judged
based on all the objective circumstances.
Second, when a Federal habeas court finds a
Sixth Amendment violation in the rejected plea context,
it should not categorically require the government to
reoffer a rejected plea deal.  That decision should be
left to the sentencing court, and requiring the
government to reoffer a rejected plea deal in a context
like this case where the plea agreement required the
defendant to do something other than plead guilty --
give testimony against her aunt -- it doesn't make
sense, and the government should not be required to make
the reoffer.
Every defendant who rejects a plea offer and
then is convicted after a trial will have an incentive
and will want to revert back to a plea deal that she
rejected beforehand.  The statement of a convicted
defendant that she would not have withdrawn her plea --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, years ago, one
of my colleagues, not on this bench, but a different
one, said to me -- you know, there's much to-do about
judges basing credibility on demeanor.  And he said, no
one does that.  What you base it on is the internal
consistency and logic of the testimony and how it's
corroborated by circumstances.
And he said, otherwise, you just rarely hear
anybody say, story makes sense, nothing corrupt-- story doesn't
make sense, the story's not corroborated, but the guy
looks like he's telling the truth.
I'm reading all the decisions that you cited
for me and not one, including in this circuit, relies
simply on that kind of statement.  Every one of them is
based on comparing the testimony to other factors; to
logic, to evidence, to objectives.
So I don't know what rule it is, what
objective evidence means.  Do you need corroboration the
way you need to prove a murder?  Is that what you want
us to announce?
MS. O'CONNELL:  I don't -- we're not asking
for any kind of a special rule that there has to
be -- you know, a certain amount of corroborating
evidence in addition to the defendant's statement.  I do
think it is just a general rule that you have to expand
out to all the objective circumstances to evaluate the
credibility of the defendant.
And what the Sixth Circuit said in this case
is, unlike some circuits, this court does not require
that a defendant must support his own assertion that he
would have accepted the offer with additional objective
evidence.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It said it, but it
didn't do it.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, to the extent that the
court was saying that the defendant's statement should
be credited or not credited alone, without necessarily
looking at everything, that's wrong.  And to the extent
that it -- that it looked to other evidence in the
record and to corroborating circumstances, the ones that
it pointed to were too weak, and they were also very
selective.
The court pointed to two things that the
court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, counselor, that's
what juries do all the time, selectivity.  That doesn't
move me.  What I want to know is, why do we announce a
rule that, somehow, suggests a limitation that can't
exist?  Meaning what judges look to, to determine
credibility relies on factors that you can't sum up in
one word?
MS. O'CONNELL:  All we're asking the Court
to announce or to clarify on this question is that the
subjective statement -- or the self-serving statement of
a defendant in these circumstances should be viewed
with skepticism and that the court should look --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Every court says that.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, to the -- there could
be confusion on what the Sixth Circuit's rule is.  I
mean, there is -- the Sixth Circuit believed that it was
announcing a rule or that it has a standard --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, are there rules in
this area?  I didn't think -- are there rules?  I mean,
doesn't every judge, whenever that judge is deciding a
factual matter or the jury, take into account from every
witness, whether that witness is making a pretty
self-serving statement?  I mean, that's a factor.
And I guess we could have some situations,
sometime, in some place, where a witness got on the
stand and said something that was totally in his favor,
but when you heard it, hmm, and you knew the case, hmm,
he's right.  And then that could happen with this kind
of witness, too.  It could happen.  I'm not saying it
very often does, but it could.
So why should we have any special rule for
these witnesses and not for any other?
MS. O'CONNELL:  We are not asking for any
kind of a special rule.  We are just asking that -- that
the Court clarify, if it addresses the second question,
that what the Sixth Circuit is saying, that you
essentially -- if you interpret it to mean that you
don't have to look out to all the -- the objective
circumstances to determine the credibility of the
defendant, that that's wrong.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you need to
give us some examples of things that don't count.  I
thought it was in your brief that you had said, look,
the fact that it turns out to have been a very bad
deal -- you know, the bargain was one year, and the
sentence after guilty was 20 years, that, I take it, you
say is not a corroborating factor.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Not in this case.  The --
the disparity between the sentence that a person
receives after the plea deal and the sentence that they
received after a trial is going to be present in every
case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.
MS. O'CONNELL:  In fact, it has to be for
prejudice.  That could be a corroborating circumstance
or something to support the defendant's statement in a
case where, like some of the court of appeals' opinions,
the defendant was misadvised on sentencing exposure.
The lawyer said, well, you should reject this plea deal
for 15 years because the maximum that you could get at
trial is 20, and so it's worth the risk.
But this defendant understood completely and
said multiple times, on the record, that she understood
that the -- the potential sentence for a murder
conviction was a life sentence and that that was back on
the table, if she withdrew the plea offer.
JUSTICE ALITO:  On the question of this --
of this sentence, what do you think were the -- the
range of reasonable sentences that could have been
imposed in compliance with our recent decisions?
You have -- you have the sentence that was
offered before the trial, but that was predicated on, A,
testimony and, B, not having to go to trial.  And then
you have the sentence that was imposed after the trial,
when there was no testimony and there was a trial.
So what was the -- what do you think a trial
court could reasonably do in that situation, just split
the difference?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, I think the trial
court has a lot of discretion under the Court's opinion,
but I think what -- what should have happened in this
circumstance is to go back to the sentencing court, not
require the government to reoffer this plea deal, which
just simply can't be -- can't be offered and accepted
anymore.
In fact, in the record, when you see it
being reoffered, they're saying we're offering
manslaughter in exchange for her testimony at a trial
that already happened.  It doesn't make sense.
In this case, there -- there should be no
reoffer.  We should go based on the conviction after
trial because of that, and perhaps there could be some
kind of a reduction of the sentence within the district
court's discretion to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why -- why -- you made
the point that this plea bargain could not be carried
out once the number one condition, the prosecutor said,
you testify against your aunt, and then we'll give you
this deal.  Once the aunt is tried and she doesn't
testify, there's no -- there's no plea bargain.
So why isn't that enough to decide this
case?  If you can't tell a prosecutor to renew a bargain
that can't be carried out, then it's become impossible.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, I mean, we think
that's right.  I don't know that it makes sense to say
that, because there is no remedy, that the Court
shouldn't address the first or second questions.
I mean, maybe if the Court thinks that
there's -- there's definitely no remedy and that this
20- to 40-year sentence should remain in place, but --
but, exactly, we don't think that the -- that the
government should be required to reoffer the plea
agreement in these circumstances.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But we're in a position now,
aren't we, where the State court can do exactly that,
can say the circumstances have changed and -- and so
leave everything undisturbed.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes.  The problem -- one of
the problems here is that the Sixth Circuit sort of
took, as a given, that in circumstances like this, that
the -- the original plea offer has to be reoffered.  And
what we think the court was saying in Lafler is that
that's one thing that's on the table.
It's not necessarily required in every case.
There could be other creative remedies, like there could
be a defendant who can no longer -- who missed the
opportunity to give the testimony she was supposed to
give, but perhaps she has information on somebody else,
and so maybe we could do a renegotiation of the plea.
The Sixth Circuit, we do not think, should
be just requiring after it finds a Sixth Amendment
violation that the government reoffer a plea agreement
in circumstances that are different from those in
Lafler.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But isn't that -- I
mean, the court didn't say that the court -- that the
court below -- the Sixth Circuit didn't say that the
court below had to accept the reoffered plea agreement.
It seemed inherent in Lafler and Frye that
what the Court was saying is that the court below has to
use its judgment on whether offer -- accepting the plea
is -- is right or giving another remedy is right.  All
of these arguments should be before that court, not
before us, as an absolute rule.
MS. O'CONNELL:  That's right.  And -- and we
simply think that the decision whether to require the
government to reoffer it in the first place should also
be something that's left up to the sentencing court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that's your only
point, which is that that should be an issue for the
court below?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes.  That this should all be
left to the discretion -- discretion of the sentencing
court to come up with an adequate remedy.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But some remedy has to
be offered --
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- if there is a
violation.
MS. O'CONNELL:  The -- the Court's opinion
in Lafler, I think, leaves that question open.  It says
that it could be the circumstances that the sentencing
judge determines that the most fair result is to leave
the conviction and the sentence in place, but the
sentencing court has that discretion.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Newman?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF VALERIE R. NEWMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. NEWMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
There is no question that the Michigan Court
of Appeals erred and created an end-run around
Strickland in finding the professed -- that if a
defendant professes innocence, that there's no need to
look any further to say that defense counsel provided
effective assistance.
There is also --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I agree with you -- I
agree with you and so does your adversary, but he says
there is nothing in this record to show what research
was done or not done.
The fact that the prior counsel's record
wasn't reviewed doesn't say that he didn't talk to the
prosecutor, doesn't say that he didn't look into other
record evidence, any of the discovery that had been
filed with the court, or any of the other circumstances
that could have informed him adequately.
MS. NEWMAN:  That is partially true, Justice
Sotomayor.  The record does show that, at every turn,
when Mr. Toca stepped into the courtroom, he asked for
more time and indicated he wasn't ready.  The record
does show that, as soon as the plea was withdrawn,
Mr. Toca said, I need more time.  I'm not ready to go to
trial.  And in all fairness, my -- my client deserves to
have a fair trial.  I'm not ready.
He's not ready to go to trial.  He doesn't
have a good handle on what the record is.  My brother
counsel makes an argument that Mr. Toca made a very
sophisticated sentencing analysis and, therefore, had a
grasp of the record.  I would disagree with that
interpretation of the record.
Mr. Toca came in and said that the
guidelines were two to five on the minimum sentence.
The prosecutor said, I don't know what the guidelines
are, and I don't care.  There's -- we don't even know if
his recitation of what the guidelines range was, was
accurate, so there is nothing on this record to show
that Mr. Toca even knew anything about the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you arguing that he --
he needed to be -- he needed to have enough material and
to have familiarized himself enough with everything
that's relevant to the case to be able to go to trial
before he could move to have the -- the previous plea
withdrawn?
MS. NEWMAN:  No, my argument does not go
that far.  What I'm arguing --
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Well, then I
don't understand what the argument was.
MS. NEWMAN:  The argument is that defense
counsel has a duty to investigate, that the defense
attorney has a duty to be able to inform the client of
the risks of either accepting a plea, withdrawing a
plea, whatever the case.  In this case, it's withdrawing
a plea that has already been accepted by the court.
This is a very significant step in this matter.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's true, but --
but you -- you have the duty, or -- or counsel for the
defendant has the duty to show that counsel did not do
that.  It's -- it seems to me you are putting the burden
on the other side to -- to prove that the -- that
counsel knew all this.  And that's not the way -- that's
not the way the game is played.
MS. NEWMAN:  I agree with that,
Justice Scalia, and we are not putting the burden on the
other side.  There is -- I will refer the Court to the
Pierson affidavit, which is in the Joint Appendix at
page 298.  That affidavit, in particular, paragraphs 6,
7, and 8, indicate that, at an arbitration hearing,
when Ms. Titlow testified and Mr. Ott or deputy --
Sheriff's Deputy Ott testified -- in arbitration
hearings, witnesses are put under oath, and the
affidavit is a sworn affidavit from an attorney.
So it is a notarized affidavit from -- about
testimony that was taken under oath, that indicates that
Mr. Toca approached Ms. Titlow while she was in jail,
while she was represented by counsel, that the approach
was, you should reject the plea and not testify against
your aunt.  That's the evidence that we have in the
record, and that is not just Ms. Titlow.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But just -- just to be
clear, isn't that after Titlow had asked for an attorney
because Titlow had talked with the jailer, who
encouraged Titlow to plead innocent?  So -- so you have
to include that preface to this statement, or it's quite
incomplete.
MS. NEWMAN:  Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or correct me if that's
wrong.
MS. NEWMAN:  I would say that's wrong, and
that's where the court of appeals was wrong again and why
the State court's findings are entitled to no deference
because the state court took that affidavit from William
Pierson and turned the words on its head.
The affidavit does not state that Vonlee
Titlow approached the sheriff's deputy and asked for a
new attorney.  The affidavit states that the sheriff's
deputy approached her.  He told her she should consult
with his attorney because his attorney was really good
and his attorney would be able to help her.
And so it's the sheriff's deputy,
unequivocally, from this affidavit, because it's the
only place that this evidence comes from, it's the
sheriff's deputy -- I'm sorry.  Were you looking -- it's
on page 298 of the Joint Appendix in William Pierson's
affidavit.
It's the sheriff's deputy that sets
everything in motion about innocence.  And why does he
do that?  Because he's in the courtroom when the plea is
entered.  And what is part of the plea?  Part of the
plea is that Vonlee Titlow passed a polygraph.  Well, to
a layperson what does that mean?  You pass a polygraph,
you are innocent, you didn't do the crime.
Well, in this case, that's not the situation
at all.  The passing of the polygraph cemented her guilt
in participating in this crime.  But what the -- what
she passed in the polygraph was that she was an aider
and abettor, so it was her aunt who took the pillow and
smothered her uncle, not Ms. Titlow, but she was
present.  She participated.  She accepted money after
the crime.
So everything that happened in the Michigan
Court of Appeals took the actual facts and turned them
on its head, which is why the factual findings are not
entitled to deference.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it -- is it
unreasonable to read the Pierson affidavit -- and -- and
you submitted that; isn't that correct?
MS. NEWMAN:  Correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  To read it to
mean that there were discussions between Deputy Ott and
Titlow, and Titlow said she wasn't guilty?  Ott said,
well, if you are not guilty, you shouldn't plead guilty.
I will refer you to an attorney.  If you want me to, I
could ask somebody to come and talk to me.
That seems to be a direct quote from -- from
Titlow.  Isn't that -- so isn't it reasonable to read it
that way?
MS. NEWMAN:  Justice Alito, that's one --
part of what you said, I would agree with, that the --
it does state in the affidavit, certainly, that he had
an attorney that was really good and could ask somebody
to come talk to me.  But the rest of the statements, I
would argue, are -- are inferences and not facts, and we
have facts in the affidavit.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So the point is that there
has to be some evidence.  You -- you are saying that the
court was wrong when they said your client said she
wasn't guilty.
Now, this affidavit doesn't show that.  I
mean, paragraph 6 doesn't say who spoke first, but
common sense suggests that the deputy sheriff wouldn't
have made that statement, unless she spoke first.  I
mean, does he go around saying to everybody, just
generally, oh -- you know, if you are not guilty, you
shouldn't plead guilty.
I mean, it says they had discussions, and
during the discussions, he told her she shouldn't plead
guilty if she wasn't guilty.
MS. NEWMAN:  It also -- it also says, with
all due respect, that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Where?
MS. NEWMAN:  -- the deputy approached her.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Where -- approached her --
MS. NEWMAN:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and had discussions with
her.  It doesn't say why he approached her.  I mean, I
just don't think people normally do that, they go to
every person in jail and say, you know, if you are not
guilty, you shouldn't plead guilty.
I mean, somebody might, but something
triggered that advice, and the affidavit doesn't tell me
what triggered that advice.  So I could infer that what
triggered the advice was her statement she was not
guilty, or I could infer this is an unusual situation
where, for some reason unknown, he brought it up.  I
don't know, from reading paragraph 6.
MS. NEWMAN:  And Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So whose burden is it?
MS. NEWMAN:  Justice Breyer, I would argue
that it's -- it's an inference that doesn't matter.
It's an --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
MS. NEWMAN:  -- in this case.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't matter.  Why
doesn't it matter?  Because if she went, he -- she
said -- you know, I'm not really guilty, he said, well,
you shouldn't plead guilty, she said -- but I have a
lawyer that will get rid of your guilty plea.  If it
went something like that, and then we assume the lawyer
was told about this -- it doesn't say, but that's a
reasonable assumption.
And then the court opinion of Michigan seems
to make sense that that was a reason -- that was one of
the reasons that made his conduct in -- in withdrawing
the plea or -- you know, not strongly advising her
against it.  That was one reason why that wasn't an
inadequate assistance of counsel.
Now, where have I made my mistake in this
chain?
MS. NEWMAN:  Well, in paragraph 8 of William
Pierson's affidavit on page 298, it indicates that it
was Frederick Toca who encouraged her to reject a plea
agreement to testify against the aunt.  So, again, we
have the attorney, who is not Ms. Titlow, who is saying,
I want to withdraw my plea.  It's the attorney who is
saying to her and encouraging her to reject the plea.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Ms. Newman -- you know,
I -- I'm -- this may be the first case that I have been
involved in as a judge -- and there might be others, but
myself, personally -- where, in a situation like this,
the defendant has not put in an affidavit to explain
what happened.
There is some force to your adversary's
argument that there's a really sparse record here, and
AEDPA deference requires the burden on you.  You can't
deny that.  I guess -- I don't know if you were
responsible, but what other circumstances that would
occasion a defendant not saying, this is what I was
told?
MS. NEWMAN:  I was not the attorney.  I came
into the case at this level, so I did not do any of the
litigation below.  However, there are -- there is record
evidence to support, not -- there is record evidence
that supports the claim and maybe was a strategic
decision by the attorney not to submit other affidavits
because the attorney was simply looking for a hearing to
expand the record.  So we have --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they didn't ask for
the hearing in the court below.  They only asked for it
at the court of appeals.
MS. NEWMAN:  They -- Michigan -- Michigan --
the way Michigan works is, within 56 days of getting the
transcripts, you can file in the trial court.  If you --
if you fail to make that 56-day deadline, then your
alternative is to go to the court of appeals and ask for
a remand.
So we don't know when the case got to the
attorney.  So I don't think that there's any inference
that can be drawn from the fact that, within that very
short time period, there was no motion filed in the
trial court.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Who was the attorney at that
stage?  I take it, it wasn't the trial attorney because
the -- a big part of the claim before the Michigan Court
of Appeals was that the trial attorney was also
ineffective.
MS. NEWMAN:  Right.  It was --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Who was it?
MS. NEWMAN:  It was an appellate attorney,
Liz Jacobs, was the attorney at that stage.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And she's -- is she with
your office or she's --
MS. NEWMAN:  She's not with my office, no.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But she was appointed.
MS. NEWMAN:  She was -- I don't know if she
was appointed or retained, but she's not with my office.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I ask you,
Ms. Newman, if you would agree that the Sixth Circuit
was wrong, at least to this extent, is there -- what is
the argument for directing a prosecutor to make a plea
offer that was never previously made?  The offer that
was made is impossible to carry out now.  The offer was
conditioned on her testimony at her aunt's trial.  That
didn't happen.
So there is no -- there is no plea bargain
offered.  And yet, the court instructs a renewal,
instructs the prosecutor to renew an offer that doesn't
exist.
MS. NEWMAN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg --
Ginsburg, as the Court decided last term in
Lafler v. Cooper, the point of the remedy is to put the
defendant as closely as possible back in the position he
or she would have been in, but for the ineffective
assistance.
In Lafler v. Cooper, the Court recognized
that there's going to be situations where circumstances
have changed, and there's going to be circumstances
where that is not possible to -- to do that exactly.
In this case, of course, she cannot testify
against her aunt because her aunt was acquitted and is
deceased; however --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then how could -- how
could the Court order the prosecutor to renew an offer
that can't be made?
MS. NEWMAN:  Well, it is an offer that can
be made if you remove the condition precedent.  So the
offer -- the -- the premise of the offer is a charge
reduction.  From first-degree --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the whole -- what
drove the prosecutor to make this bargain was he wanted
the testimony, so how -- how can that -- that's -- I've
never seen anything like this, where a court orders a
prosecutor to make a plea offer that was never made.
MS. NEWMAN:  Well, again, referring to
Lafler v. Cooper, the remedy goes -- the Sixth Amendment
right attaches to the defendant, not to the prosecution,
so the goal here is to remedy, if the Court finds and
agrees that there's a Sixth Amendment violation, to
remedy that Sixth Amendment violation.  If there is an
unequal burden to be borne by one -- one side or the
other, it has to be borne by the government.
And so, therefore, the way to remedy the
Sixth Amendment violation, it was a charge reduction, is
to reoffer the manslaughter plea, which has already been
done in this case, by the way.  My client has already
accepted that plea.
And then it's up to the trial court now
whether or not to accept the plea, reject the plea, or
do some sort of modification, which is exactly what the
Sixth Circuit ordered and is exactly what this Court
ordered in -- in Lafler v. Cooper, to allow the trial
court to have the discretion in fashioning a remedy that
both will take care of the Sixth Amendment violation and
can balance the concerns of the prosecution in what's
been lost in that process, but still be able to craft a
remedy.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know that it's so
strange to make the prosecutor -- to make the
prosecution submit an offer that can no longer be
accepted.  I mean, it doesn't seem to me any more
strange than to make the prosecution submit an offer
where the situation was at the beginning.  You do this,
and I will -- you know, I will prosecute.  The quid pro
quo was you avoid the possibility of conviction.
But here, she's already been convicted.  She
had a trial -- you know, by 12 fair, impartial jurors,
and she was guilty.  That's -- that's what the jury
found.  So it seems to me just as strange to make the
prosecution, now that we know she's guilty, submit --
submit that prior offer.
So, I mean, it seems to me quite weird, in
any event.  So one -- one incremental weirdness is -- is
not so bad.
MS. NEWMAN:  Justice Scalia, though, I think
you hit the point on the head.  She -- she was always
guilty.  And as my brother counsel stated, this case, in
some ways, is very, very similar to Cooper.  You have
comments on the record by Frederick Toca that the
prosecution is -- has made comments and -- and they
reference this in the appendix, they reference a
newspaper article, the prosecutor talks about the fact
that this is nothing more than a manslaughter case.
This is -- we're charging first-degree
murder, but really, it's sort of a -- in sheep's
clothing, it's really just manslaughter.  And Frederick
Toca is saying on the record, this is just a
manslaughter case.
Why should my client accept an
above-guideline sentence of a seven-year minimum and
have to testify against a codefendant.  She's going to
go to trial, and the prosecutor's already admitted this
is nothing more than a manslaughter case, so she'll be
convicted of manslaughter, and she's going to be in a
better position following trial and conviction, just
like in Cooper.
There was no question Mr. Cooper was going
to be convicted.  There was no question at all.  Defense
counsel gave the same advice.  You can't be convicted of
the charged offense.  You're going to be convicted of a
lesser sentence, and following that conviction, you will
be in a better position for sentencing than you will be
with this plea.
JUSTICE ALITO:  If that's the case --
MS. NEWMAN:  The facts are in all force.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Your arguments seemed to
be -- have had a head-on collision.  If this is nothing
but a manslaughter case, then why was -- what argument
do you have that Toca was ineffective in saying, let's
go to trial.  So if you're convicted of manslaughter
without the plea, you'll get your guidelines sentence on
the manslaughter case?
MS. NEWMAN:  Because it's for the same
reason in Cooper.  He was absolutely wrong, and he was
not aware of the evidence that had been marshalled
against Ms. Titlow, including their own confessions.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's not a
manslaughter case.  I thought you were just saying it's
a manslaughter case.
MS. NEWMAN:  I'm saying that his
representations on the record are similar to the
representations made by Mr. Cooper's attorney on the
record.  That you would -- in response to Justice --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the charge was --
that she was convicted of second-degree murder, right?
MS. NEWMAN:  She was convicted of
second-degree murder.  And in this case -- in Cooper,
the defense attorney never filed a motion to quash.  So
he never challenged the efficient -- the legal
sufficiency of the evidence.
In this case, attorney number one,
Mr. Lustig, did file a motion to quash.  He tested the
sufficiency, the legal sufficiency of the prosecution's
case for first-degree murder.
JUSTICE ALITO:  You have my head --
MS. NEWMAN:  So there's no question --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You have my head spinning.
I thought you were making the argument that there's
nothing unfair about requiring acceptance of -- about
the imposition of a manslaughter sentence because this
was a manslaughter case.  I thought you were making that
argument.
MS. NEWMAN:  I'm not making that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Did I misunderstand that?
MS. NEWMAN:  I'm not making that argument.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought your argument was this -- there
is a reason that they spoke about, which was, well, she
said she was innocent.  Now, as to that one, what they
wrote is the record discloses that the second attorney's
advice was set in motion by defendant's statement to the
sheriff's deputy that he did not commit the offense.
Now, you say that's just contrary to fact as
you point to the affidavit.  And the affidavit I read, I
think it's a little -- rather ambiguous in that respect,
and I can overturn that, or a Federal court can, only if
this factual statement I just read you is clearly wrong,
clearly.  So I have a tough time saying it's clearly.
And I know they overstated because they said
automatically, and that’s good -- well, that may be an
overstatement.  You have to read it in light of that
sentence.  But then you're making a second argument, I
take it, if this is right.  Your second argument is,
anyway, he was incompetent for a completely different
reason.
He didn't read the record.  And if he'd read
it, he never would have made the statement that this is
just a manslaughter case.  He would have seen that, if
she withdrew her guilty plea, she'd be tried for murder,
and then she'd get a really long sentence.
So that's an ineffective assistance of
counsel.  Now, what does the court in Michigan say about
that?  Nothing.  Nothing.  So now, I wonder.  Maybe
nobody made that argument to them, or maybe they made
it, and they rejected it sub silentio.  That's why I
asked my first question.  Okay?  So -- and you heard the
response.
Even if they had heard that argument and
they said nothing about it, they don't have to -- they
don't have to mention every argument made.  If they just
deny, we assume they deny it, and what we do is see
whether they were within their rights to deny it.
That's how we are supposed to look at it, does it
clearly violate Supreme Court law to deny it?
And there is going to be a factual part of
that and a legal part.  All right.  How do we deal with
that?
MS. NEWMAN:  Well, 2254 gives -- has
separate provisions for the legal aspect of that.
JUSTICE BREYER:  First of all, did anybody
make the argument as clearly as you have made it?  I saw
what it was, I think.  So that's -- did anybody make
that argument to the Michigan court?
MS. NEWMAN:  Not that I'm aware of.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  Okay.  Well, that's
the end of that, isn't it?  What you are coming for is
you have to proceed by asking for reopening in the
Michigan court and see if they say it's too late.  And
then -- you know, et cetera, they're all spelled out in
this opinion, which I can't remember, Cullen or
Pinholster or something, and this isn't an argument for
us now.
MS. NEWMAN:  It's just a factual argument
trying to respond to the Court's questions about what
happened in this case and about what is contained in the
record and what Mr. Toca did say on the record.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If I could move
beyond the particular facts to some of the broader
points that the Solicitor General has raised?  If you
don't have the requirement of at least some
corroboration, then all you have in every case is a
completely self-serving assertion, I wouldn't have pled
guilty – if you know, if I had known this or I had known
that.
And everybody will raise that argument.
Everybody raises ineffective assistance of counsel
anyway, and they will just add onto it this plea
assertion.  I mean, shouldn't it be -- the Sixth Circuit
really went out of its way saying there is no
requirement of corroboration at all.
MS. NEWMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, there is no
question the Sixth Circuit, in dicta, said that we don't
require it, but it exists in this case.  And the reality
is, as we discussed in our brief, that every circuit
looks -- it's a Strickland analysis.
Just like every other Strickland analysis,
the court looks at the entire record and makes a
determination based on the record.  And this Court has
always eschewed hard, fast, bright-line rules in terms
of telling courts what has to exist in order to make a
specific finding.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think the
Sixth Circuit was wrong in what you are characterizing
as dicta?  You think it was wrong to say that and that
the other circuits which require something in addition,
that that's the rule that we should adopt?
MS. NEWMAN:  I don't think -- no, I don't
think that any particular rule should be adopted.  I
think the rules that exist under Strickland are fine for
the circuits.  The rules have existed for decades, and
the circuits have no trouble figuring out when the
threshold is met and when it's not.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought --
maybe I'm misremembering, but the Sixth Circuit
distanced it itself from the other circuits, didn't it?
MS. NEWMAN:  Yes, it did distance itself by
stating --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, you are telling
me the circuits have always done this.  So the
Sixth Circuit at least thinks it's doing something
different?
MS. NEWMAN:  It may think it is doing
something different, but in this particular case, there
was objective evidence that they pointed to, and as the
Solicitor General mentioned, there's always going to be
sentencing disparity because you're going to have to
have a sentencing disparity in order to show prejudice.
So, in effect, there will always be objective evidence
that will support any subjective statement of a criminal
defendant, or you're never going to see a --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if there is
always going to be objective evidence, that's like
saying you don't have to have corroboration.
MS. NEWMAN:  Right, but for this Court -- my
point is, obviously, the Court can -- can set forth a
rule, but in doing so, I think we are going to run into
what Justice Sotomayor said earlier, in terms of judges
do this all the time, they -- they figure out who's
credible.  I mean, it's never just like here's these
things, but this guy's credible, so I'm going to believe
him.
It's the totality of the circumstances, and
it's always going to have to be a totality of the
circumstances.  So to say, here's the line, there has to
be objective evidence, then what is the objective
evidence?  How are we going to define objective
evidence.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the Sixth Circuit
was wrong when it said, we are doing something different
than the other circuits?
MS. NEWMAN:  They certainly did not do
anything different in this case.  In the other cases
that I have reviewed from the Sixth Circuit, I have not
seen a case that relied only on subjective testimony, so
I can't point to a case where the Sixth Circuit is doing
something different than any other case, and I don't
believe anyone else has pointed to a particular case.
So they might think they are doing something
different, but in reality, they are doing the same thing
as everybody else.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you about Mr. --
Mr. Toca's ethical lapses?  Are they -- do they have a
legal significance in this case?
MS. NEWMAN:  They certainly speak to his
credibility. In United States v. Soto-Lopez is a very
similar case out of the Ninth Circuit, where the Court
did rely on the fact that the attorney had significant
problems, ethical problems.  And in this case,
Mr. Toca's actions and his ethical problems go
hand-in-hand.
I mean, he approached a represented
defendant who was in jail and encouraged her to reject a
plea.  He did this on a very short timeline,
admitting that -- well, not admitting, but we know, from
prior counsel, that he had not even picked up the phone
to speak with prior counsel, who had spent almost a year
litigating this case.  He had not retrieved prior
counsel's file.  It appears from the record -- those are
facts.
In terms of inferences, it appears from the
record that he got his information from the media.  This
was a highly, highly publicized case.  He signed a
retainer agreement with a client who had no money, who
gave him some jewelry and the right to promote her
story.
So he had every -- he violated multiple
ethical rules, and those violations lead to the
conclusion -- a reasonable conclusion that the reason
for withdrawing the plea was to make the deal more
lucrative.  It is not lucrative if she pleads.
She had already pled, so she had already
entered a plea, and all that was left was sentencing.
That's not a very exciting story, if your entire
retainer agreement relies on the fact that you have the
media rights to sell this story.
So, yes, I would argue that the ethical
lapses are very significant in this case and lend
credibility to --
JUSTICE ALITO:  In what sense is his
credibility -- did his credibility figure in the
decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals?
MS. NEWMAN:  Well, it didn't.  There were
separate issues raised on ethical violations, and they
were denied by the Michigan Court of Appeals, and they
were denied by the Federal court.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you know whether the Michigan
Court of Appeals was ever presented with this argument
that, in fact, he gave the advice that he did because of
the peculiar fee arrangement that he had?
MS. NEWMAN:  They were specifically
presented with the conflict argument, and off the top of
my head, I apologize, I don't recall if that is
specifically contained in there, but I think it was.  I
mean, it was definitely briefed and argued, the ethical
violations.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And Mr. Toca is now, remind
me, disbarred for?
MS. NEWMAN:  Disbarred.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Forever?
MS. NEWMAN:  Yes.  He committed multiple
misdemeanors and a felony and, in part, was disbarred
based on this conduct in this case, so he is no longer
practicing law.  Last I checked, he is no longer
practicing law anywhere in the United States.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What was submitted to the
Michigan Court of Appeals?  Not the -- I am not talking
about the exhibits that were attached, but there was a
motion, a brief?  What was it?
MS. NEWMAN:  Yes, in Michigan, it's called a
motion to remand.  You are required under the court
rules to submit a brief in support of that motion to
remand, and you are required to submit a proffer.  So
the proffer --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It's not in the habeas
record, it's not in the record of the Federal Court.
And we've been unable to get it from the State court,
but it does exist?
MS. NEWMAN:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  This motion?
MS. NEWMAN:  Absolutely, yes.  You have to
file a motion to remand, and the court of appeals
specifically references that motion to remand and the
proffer by the affidavit in stating that normally they
wouldn't consider those, that proffer as substantive of
evidence, but in this case, inexplicably, they did,
which leads to another reason why the Michigan Court of
Appeals decision is unreasonable because it is the Michigan
Court of Appeals that failed to engage in further fact
finding.
So we take the record, as we get it from
them and under Williams and other decisions, if the
Court is the one that’s responsible for an inadequate record,
I mean we have what we have, and I would argue to
this Court that the record that we had supports that the
Michigan Court of Appeals erred both legally and
factually in its findings, and therefore, neither are
entitled to any deference.  And the Sixth Circuit’s habeas grant
should be affirmed in this matter. If there are no further questions -
Thank you, your honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Bursch, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
A few clean-up points, starting with this
idea that the actual predicate was wrong.  As we
explained in our briefing in the habeas pleadings in
this very case, Titlow already conceded that the factual
predicate was correct.
And, Justice Breyer, you asked about the
quantum of proof necessary to overcome that assumption
that the Court of Appeals made based on the record
before it, and actually, the legal standard under AEDPA
is not clearly wrong.  Under 2254(e)(1), which is
reprinted in our blue brief, it is presumed correct, and
that presumption can only be overcome by clear and
convincing evidence, and we don't have that here.
Second, with respect to the advice, my
friend on the other side points to Paragraph 8 of the
Pierson affidavit.  And it's a little ironic that they
put all their eggs in that basket now because, in their
briefing, they disclaim it as triple hearsay and say
this Court should not rely on it, and she said some
things characterizing that paragraph that aren't in
there.  There is nothing in paragraph 8 or the rest of
the affidavit that says Toca approached Titlow.  I don't
know where that comes from.
But assume that everything that she says is
correct and that Toca did give the advice to withdraw
the plea, that still doesn't mean that it's bad advice
when you apply the AEDPA and Strickland rubrics because,
as Justice Alito pointed out, the differentiation in the
manslaughter guidelines and what was actually in the
plea actually makes this objectively reasonable advice.
And, in fact, it's more than that because,
at the time the plea was withdrawn, consider all the
facts that were known from talking to the prosecutor,
looking in the police file and everything else that --
that Toca presumably did.  At that time, no one knew
about this critical Chahine testimony, which only came
out at trial, that it was actually Titlow who held Uncle
Don down while he was being smothered.
I mean, that completely changes the
complexion of this case.  And so to say that Titlow was
always guilty when all of her testimony up to the point
of the plea withdrawal had been, I told my Aunt Billie
to stop, and then I left the scene, that's just not
credible.
Point on the second issue, the prejudice
prong.  Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Sotomayor, you
note that the other circuits all look at objective
evidence, and we think that's the right way to approach
this.  And you're exactly right, Chief Justice, that the
Sixth Circuit takes a different approach.
The Sixth Circuit says, although some
circuits have held that a defendant must support his own
assertion that he would have accepted the offer with
additional objective evidence, we, in this circuit, have
declined to adopt such a requirement.
And you can see how that difference played
out in this very case because the Sixth Circuit didn't
look at all the other evidence that was in the record
that was contrary to this self-serving statement that
Titlow made; that Titlow had the plea in hand and,
before the ink was even dry, was already professing
innocence and talking to other lawyers; that she fired
Lustig and there was no reason to do that, unless she
wanted to -- to withdraw the plea; that she did not have
a propensity for truthfulness.
At trial, she lied about the fact that she
was drunk, when she was not, the night of the murder.
The evidence came out that she asked Chahine to lie
about the alibi, and she hid the murder weapon.  And
then you've got all these statements at the sentencing
hearing and post remand, where she's continually
asserting her innocence.  It's happening all the time.
When you consider all that objectively,
under the other circuit standards, clearly, that would
not be sufficient to establish prejudice here.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I --
MR. BURSCH:  That's the objective evidence.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I don't understand
what you're saying.  The other side says -- and I think
it's the standard -- that you look at the totality of
the circumstances.
MR. BURSCH:  Correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And what you're saying
is they didn't do that here.  It's not that -- they use
some objective evidence, you're saying they didn't use
other objective evidence.  I am --
MR. BURSCH:  Here's -- yeah.  Here's the
connector, Justice Sotomayor.  The reason they didn't
look at the other evidence is because they have a
different rule.  They don't think they have to look at
it.  They did look at things like sentencing
disparities.
As the Solicitor General's office explained,
that shouldn't come into play here because that was a
well-known disparity; it wasn't something that was
hidden by client's ineffective assistance.  And they --
the Sixth Circuit talks about the fact that she accepted
the plea once and then withdrew it.  Obviously, that
cuts both ways.
So all you are left with is the subjective
testimony.  And when you look at all the other objective
evidence, the evidence that other circuits would look
at, there's really only one possible outcome here.
So in sum, Your Honors -- oh, I guess I do
want to mention one other quick point since my light
hasn't gone yet.  The book deal, there was no book deal.
Look at page Joint Appendix 60, and I've seen copyright
assignments.  That wasn't the case here.  They were
trying to raise money for the trial.
And -- and this case had nothing to do with
the reason why Toca was disbarred.  That's at Joint
Appendix 302 to 317.  It was because he falsely put
someone else's license tabs on his license plate, and
that was a misdemeanor, and then he lied about it.
In sum, record silence under AEDPA and
Strickland means the State wins, not the convicted
murderer.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
