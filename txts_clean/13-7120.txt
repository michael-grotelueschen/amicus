CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

United States.
Ms. Menendez.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE M. MENENDEZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. MENENDEZ:  Good morning, Your Honor.
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:
The residual clause of the violent felony
definition of the Armed Career Criminal Act is
unconstitutionally vague because its text and structure
do not set out with clarity what predicate offenses fall
within its coverage and what do not.  Its vagueness is
proven by this Court's inability after repeated efforts
to discern a meaningful and replicable interpretive
framework that will guide lower courts.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Menendez, just to
clarify, you are contesting only the residual clause,
not the rest of the statute.  So if the statute ending
with -- it lists burglary, arson or extortion or
involves the use of explosives, you're not attacking any
of that.  It's just the residual clause; is that
correct?
MS. MENENDEZ:  That is correct, Your Honor.
And we believe, in fact, that the other
portions of this statute shed some light onto why the
residual clause is unconstitutionally vague.  For
instance, the other portions of the definition tie
qualification for violent felony status directly to the
elements of the offense in question.
The force clause requires that the use of
force or the attempted use of force be an element of the
offense.  The burglary, arson, extortion, and use of
explosives that Your Honor references are determined by
reference to the elements of the offense.  A categorical
analysis.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, I know that we are --
asked you to argue this vagueness issue, but when you
were here before, you didn't think that the statute was
vague as applied to your client.  As I remember, your
argument was it's clear that your client did not fall
within the residual clause, largely because he was
convicted.  The offense that's at issue is a possession
offense, and you argue that none of the specific
offenses listed is -- is a possession offense.
MS. MENENDEZ:  You're correct, Your Honor,
that when -- when we were here last time, we argued that
it is plainly not included for the reasons you mention
as well as others.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So if it's not plainly
included, why do we have to get to this issue at all?
Why should we reach out to decide a constitutional
question?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Certainly, Your Honor.  The
fact that we believe it's clearly excluded seems to be
at odds at the opinion -- of the opinion of the
Solicitor General in the United States, the Eighth
Circuit Court of Appeals and other courts.  The fact
that something that seems obviously not to fall within
the plain definition but is still held to fall within
the plain definition by numerous courts reveals the
vagueness of the residual clause.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But we get -- almost every
case that comes here involves a dispute among the lower
courts about what something means, about what the
constitutional rule is or what the statutory
interpretation should be.
So the mere fact that there's disagreement
about this, that shows that it's unconstitutionally
vague?
MS. MENENDEZ:  This goes far beyond mere
disagreement, Your Honor.  I can think of no other
instance in which the Court has endeavored so many times
in so few years to answer precisely the same question,
not merely interpreting the same 14 words, but asking
each time whether a single offense satisfies those 14
words.
JUSTICE ALITO:  In -- in James, in 2007, we
held that the residual clause -- we said the residual
clause is not unconstitutionally vague.  In Sykes, in
2011, we reaffirmed that.
Can you give me other examples of instances
in which the Court has overruled a constitutional
holding that has been twice reaffirmed within a period
of 8 years?  Has that happened frequently?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I think -- I
don't have a case at the ready for that question, but
what I can say is what doesn't happen frequently, is
that this Court has to grapple with such frequency and
is still unable to create an interpretive framework.
The heart of stare decisis is, in part, workability.
Precedent that remains workable and useful that applies
guidance to the lower court deserves greater deference.
And with due respect to this Court's understandable
hesitation to declare the statute unconstitutionally
vague, that precedent is simply proven not to be
workable.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, do you think the issue
is whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague or
whether this Court's interpretations of the statute
create the basis for a vagueness argument?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Can -- can a statute be
vague simply because this Court messes it up?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, that is not the
case in this case.  I don't know whether it's possible
for a statute to be rendered vague by poor
interpretation, but in this case the vagueness in here
is in the text and operation itself.  This Court's
repeated efforts to discern a useful interpretive
framework haven't caused the vagueness, but they prove
the vagueness.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose that you had a
State court meeting of judges for sentencing and they
agreed that, within their discretion to impose a
maximum, that they would impose a greater sentence if
the defendant had a rap sheet, some previous offenses
which created a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another. Now, this is within their mandatory
discretion, I understand that.
Would you say that's poor judging, that
that's vague?  That they'd be better off not -- not
saying it at all?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I think that
judges are tasked with deciding the individual case
before them, so --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  My hypothetical
is the judges say as a sentencing matter, as a matter of
policy in this jurisdiction, we will increase your
sentence if you committed an offense that categorically
poses a serious potential risk of injury, physical
injury to another.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think that's bad
judging?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I'm never going to presume to
accuse a judge of judging poorly, but --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, it's a hypothetical.
You can say it's bad; it's a hypothetical.
MS. MENENDEZ:  I think that that goes beyond
the task of judging, Your Honor, into the task of
legislating.  To decide that as a --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you -- you don't
think judges should give reasons for what they do?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  I
think the difference is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You absolutely do think
they should give reasons for what they do?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you say that this is a
vague reason?  This is -- this is bad reasoning, bad
judging?
MS. MENENDEZ:  The part of your hypothetical
that troubled me, Your Honor, was the idea that the
judges would get together and make policy decisions
unfettered to an individual case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, judge -- judges meet
all the time on sentencing policy.  They -- they educate
each other about what sentence is and they -- and
they -- and they announce the policy to say in this
court, we want all members of the bar to know that if
there's a rap sheet, prior convictions that have a -- an
offense which categorically is a serious risk of
physical injury to another, we will up the sentence.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think that's bad
judging?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I think that's verging into
legislating, and I think that that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can -- can they -- can they
do that, as a matter of law, not just as a matter of
recommending to their fellow judges?  Can they reverse
one of their fellow judges if -- if the fellow judge
does not adhere to that -- I've -- I've never heard of
such a thing.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The hypothetical is that
this --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I agree with you, it sounds
like legislation to me.  It's a hypothetical that's
fanciful.
MS. MENENDEZ:  I would certainly be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think it's bad
judging for a judge to say what his policy is going to
be for future cases?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Yes.  I think that a judge
should decide each case on the facts before them.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, wait.  There are a
lot of States that have guidelines and they're
legislated and there are committees that decide it;
there are judges on the committees.  So -- so I don't
know that that's going to help us, or at least not me,
too much.
I do -- I have counted up the number of
splits and so forth in your briefs and the others
presented to us, and adding in the cases, I -- I think
generously on the basis of what's decided -- what you've
presented to us, there are 14 splits.  That's over a
period of 20 years, and -- or so, 15 years, anyway.  And
there are literally, really, there are hundreds of
different crimes, thousands perhaps, by the time you get
the --
So I can't -- I don't know how to decide
whether 14 is a lot or a little.  I -- I'm really, I'm
genuinely -- I'm at sea on this, because maybe 14 is just
a few.  I mean, after all, every statute has uncertainty
at the edges.  Or maybe it's a lot.  Help me.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  Two things,
Your Honor.  I think first of all that more than the
number of splits is the fact that each of this Court's
efforts seems to answer the question before the Court
that has a very difficult time answering any of those 14
questions.  I think even --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, is there any example
that you can think of where that was a basis for holding
a statute unconstitutional?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, in the vagueness
cases that we have cited, one of the things often
discussed by the Court is that it isn't amenable to a
useful interpretive framework, that it isn't being
consistently applied by lower courts.
But the second --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I've never heard of that as
a criterion.  I mean, the common law had a method.  I
don't know -- and they even had crimes, you know.  There
were common law crimes.  We -- we have statutes.  The
government cites many which use such words as "risk of
harm" or "reckless" or -- they use words like we have
here, "serious risk" or "risk of physical harm."
They've cited a lot.  There -- there are other statutes
that involve words like that.  Are we holding all those
unconstitutional?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Absolutely not, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I know.  I understand you
think that.  All I need is help.
MS. MENENDEZ:  I'll answer your first
question and then turn to the focus --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, that is only the
question that I have.  The first one is the one.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, in addition to
the number of splits and whether 14 is a lot or a
little, 14 is -- is an enormous amount of times for this
Court to have to weigh in to resolve an unsettleable
question.  The exact same question, Your Honor; not
variance on a question, but precisely the same question.
But I think that we should also take
instruction from the lower courts and what they are
saying about their struggle.  We have cited half a dozen
circuits, and these are seasoned jurists who describe
this as everything from a black hole to impossible --
impossible to meaningfully and consistently apply.
So we're not just talking about counting the
number of disagreements.  We're also talking about a
completely unworkable framework that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Ms. Menendez, I -- I
suppose this is connected to Justice Breyer's question.
Do you think that there's some core that everybody, in
fact, does agree upon?  In other words, that there are
some offenses which people just say, well, of course
that fits within the residual clause.  It's not the kind
of thing that creates splits, it's not the kind of thing
that creates controversy, that there's a core of
agreement as to what it means and that all the trouble
is occurring on the margins.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, the margins here
are so much bigger than the core that even if we are
able to agree on a small number of things that might
clearly fall within the center, the fact is that the
vast majority --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What do you think is in the
core?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I think
kidnapping might be in the core.  A kidnapping that
doesn't fall within the force clause, which many would
do, might be in the core.
But, Your Honor, I think what's more
instructive is the fact that so many things that the
government even suggested are easy cases -- the examples
that they give on pages 8 and 9 of their brief -- on
closer examination, they're not that easy.  For example,
child abuse.  Now it's true that one circuit or multiple
circuits have held that child abuse counts, but the
Spencer case, which examined a Florida statute of child
abuse, found that it didn't account.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  The government says that to
declare a statute facially vague, all its applications
have to be facially vague.  And I guess you're
contesting that standard because you're admitting that
at least one thing that you can think of, kidnapping,
that there -- that that application would be
appropriate; is that right?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I think that it's
important to look at where the government's standard of
has to be vague in every imagined application comes
from.  It comes from Flipside v. Hoffman Estates, which
dealt with licensing and financial fines and, more
importantly, where everyone agreed that the conduct in
question there was clearly in the core.
This is different in all three respects.
This deals not only with an onerous sentencing penalty,
but a mandatory one where Congress has acted to take
discretion away --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you're not answering
the question, though.  The question is whether you agree
with the government that so long as there is something
that is clearly within the core, it's not vague.  Do you
agree with that or disagree with that?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I do not agree with that,
Your Honor.  I think that that's unworkable.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose you could have a
statute that criminalized annoying conduct, right?  And
according to the government, that would not be
unconstitutional, because there's some stuff that is
clearly annoying, right?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that's a perfectly good
statute according to the government, yes?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you do with all
of the statutes that are cited in the appendix in the
government's brief that they say uses such language as
"serious risk of physical injury to another," the same
words that are used here?  Except this says "potential."
What do you -- the -- the government suggests that all
of those statutes would be vulnerable under your
reading.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Thank you, Your Honor.
The -- the term "serious risk" is not on trial here.
None of those with the, perhaps, possible exception, we
believe, of the two described on the first page come
even close in operation or function to what the residual
clause does.  In almost every one of those cases, it's
either part of a limiting definition, it's subject to an
additional limiting definition, or it's one of several
elements which help narrow the conduct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or -- or is it also that
in most of the statutes that were cited, it depends on
the facts of the particular case?  It's the opposite of
the categorical approach.
MS. MENENDEZ:  And that is a very important
distinction, Your Honor, absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which means it's up to the
jury and juries, you know, don't -- don't have to be
clear.  They can be vague.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Well, juries are routinely
tasked with the question of something -- whether some
individual conduct, not an abstract imagination of
conduct, but actually what the defendant did constitutes
a serious risk.  That, combined with the fact that it's
usually part of a much narrower statute, prevents those
from being vague.
In addition, Your Honor, with respect to
your question, not one of those statutes, not one has
given rise to the expressions of frustration from lower
courts.  The 14 disagreements --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  But then, look,
that -- that's -- you've got -- you've got that.  But
it's not -- that can't be.  There's something odd about
this statute that's causing the problem and I can't put
my finger on it.  And what you've done is simply point
out that courts have had difficulty with it.  Well, that
isn't enough, I don't think.
Why?  The words seem clear enough.  What is
it about this that's led to this difficulty?  It
certainly isn't a problem to identify many cases where
there is a serious risk of physical harm.  But there's
something that's given rise to this, and I haven't yet
been able to articulate it to -- to myself.  You've
thought about it more than I.
MS. MENENDEZ:  I've thought about it a lot,
Your Honor.  I think there's several things that give
rise to the confusion.
One is the fact that it asks judges to
answer of -- an almost impossible-to-answer question.
They have to imagine whether an offense in the abstract,
and frankly, in its ordinary case, presents a
substantial risk.  How to even select the ordinary case
is something the statute gives no guidance about.  And
what degree of risk is required, where to get the
information regarding the risk; it's completely
imaginary and subjective and it's the --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose the -- suppose the
question of whether it's a serious potential risk of
physical injury to another were a factual question
submitted to the jury to be determined on the basis of
what your client did.  Would that be unconstitutionally
vague?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I think that
would go some direction towards solving the problem
because it would require fact-specific analysis by the
jury.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that a yes or a no?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I think that if it still had
the -- had the -- I think that would avoid the vagueness
problem, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, it would create
other problems, wouldn't it?  I mean, we'd be trying to
do this based on 20-year-old convictions and -- and
often on questions that nobody had an incentive to argue
or to litigate.  Wouldn't that be -- I mean, that's the
reason we went down this road, isn't it?
MS. MENENDEZ:  And Your Honor points out a
very good point about why I hesitate to think that
that's a solution.  It's an unworkable solution, but
might get around the vagueness if the parties were
entitled both to argue it to a jury and to relitigate
the specific facts.  But I don't think anyone is
imagining that recidivist statutes could function that
way in the courts.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I wasn't asking about
a recidivist statute.  I was asking about a statute that
imposed a particular penalty for possession of -- of a
sawed-off shotgun.  And it says or it -- someone is
convicted under a statute that has this language and the
possession of the sawed-off shotgun was -- had just
occurred.
Do you think you think that would not be
unconstitutionally vague?
MS. MENENDEZ:  If the jury was asked in this
offense to decide whether that possession presented a
substantial risk beyond a reasonable doubt, I don't
think that would cause the same problems, Your Honor.
I think another thing that -- that is
inherent in other parts of the violent felony definition
that's instructive about what's wrong with this one is
that when it requires the question to be an element of
the offense, as with the force clause or, for instance,
burglary, you -- all you need to do is look at the
elements of that predicate offense to determine whether
it qualifies.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Congress was trying to
do something here and some may think it's a good thing
to do, some may thing it's not a good thing to do, it's
a legitimate thing to do.  And that is to impose an
enhanced penalty for people who -- felons who possess
firearms and have a record of prior convictions for
certain category of offenses.
Now, if you don't use -- if -- if the -- the
residual clause is held to be unconstitutionally vague,
is there any other way that Congress could accomplish
that end?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Yes, Your Honor, I think
there is.  I think one solution would be to both tie the
risk to the elements.  So, for instance, you can keep
the same 14 words, but add in "has as an element the
pre" -- "creation of serious potential risk," and
anything that didn't fall within that, Congress could
simply add as an enumerated offense.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Why does that solve the
problem, has as an element the creation of a serious
potential risk?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Because then litigants,
defendants and judges would only have to look at the
criminal code of the State that has the predicate
offense and see whether it has as an element the
creation of risk.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, an offense that
prohibits the possession of a -- of a sawed-off shotgun
has as an element the possession of a sawed-off shotgun.
So you'd have to decide whether that element creates the
risk.  I don't see how that solves it.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Under my solution,  -- mere
possession of a short-barrel shotgun would not count
under Minnesota law because it doesn't require the
possession in connection with behavior that creates a
risk.  But if I may --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the jury would have
found -- would have found the -- the fact of the risk,
right --
MS. MENENDEZ:  Precisely, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- in the -- in the cases
that you're describing?
MS. MENENDEZ:  In my imagined solution, Your
Honor.  But frankly, it's up to Congress.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So -- so what you're saying,
essentially, is that all the statues in the back of the
government's brief would count?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But nothing else would.  In
other words, you have to have it listed specifically,
and this conduct created a serious risk of injury.
MS. MENENDEZ:  If Congress chose that as a
solution, yes, Your Honor.  I think that this
demonstrates why this needs to be left to Congress.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Extortion doesn't have
that.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Extortion is an enumerated
offense, and that would pose the additional solution,
Your Honor.  Anything that doesn't have --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any crime like
that?  What is the crime like that?  I mean --
MS. MENENDEZ:  There's 200 crimes like that.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in the first one, use,
attempted use, threatened use of physical force, and
you're simply adding to those -- to those three
categories, you'd say, or risk -- or serious risk of
what?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Has as an element the
creation of a serious risk or a serious potential risk.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Of?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Of injury to another.  It's
up to Congress how they would choose to define it, but
if they wanted it --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I thought --
MS. MENENDEZ:  -- to hew closely to the
residual clause -- I apologize, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  No.  Go ahead.
MS. MENENDEZ:  If they want it to hew
closely to the status quo, were Congress to choose that,
then requiring that risk to be an element, the
government has collected for us 200 examples of statutes
that have risk as an element, they would presumably
count.  And if there were some left out of this solution
that Congress wanted to -- to include, like, for
instance, if extortion were not one of the enumerated
offenses and they wanted to include it, all they have to
do is list it.  It's a perfect congressional function,
Your Honors.  They can hear data.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.
MS. MENENDEZ:  They can assess risk.  They
can hear testimony.  They can decide what should and
shouldn't count, but we shouldn't be imagining it every
time.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are you saying that this is
something -- in response to Justice Alito's question --
that this is a way that Congress could fix the statute?
Or are you saying that it's a way we could fix the
statute?  In other words, that it's an available savings
construction that we should feel free to adopt.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I -- I don't
presume to tell the Court what it can and cannot do, but
it has strived four -- and  now the fifth time to create
an interpretive framework that would solve the problem.
I think that my suggestion is a good one, but far be it
for me to say what Congress should --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let me ask you something.
Can you get -- can you get to your suggestion from the
text of the statute?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I do not believe so, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think so either.
MS. MENENDEZ:  If it were in the text, we
probably wouldn't be in this place to begin with, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's -- it's important to
me to evaluate your statement that most of the problems
are at the margins, not at the core.  How -- how do I do
that?  It -- it -- it's -- my assumption was the
opposite.  I thought the margins were few and that the
core was -- covered a vast amount of criminal conduct.
Where -- where do I look to determine who's right on
that?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I think that
we've grappled with that especially in our reply brief.
You're exactly right.  In a traditional statute, the
core is large, the margins are gray, and the gray
margins shouldn't lead to a conclusion of vagueness.
But in this case, the fact that over, and over, and over
again there's disagreement about things that should seem
obvious, shows us that that core is smaller and smaller,
if not extremely small, compared to the margins.
Look at the easy cases -- the easy cases
that the government pointed to at pages 8 and 9 of their
briefs.  On closer examination, those give rise to
disagreement.  They're not uniformly settled in favor of
inclusion or exclusion.  Anything that seems easy at
first blush really isn't.  There's several splits
pending right now, Your Honor.  And I don't mean to just
dismiss them as disagreements about outcome.
Disagreements about how to apply this Court's tests that
aren't going to be answered by this Court's decision in
Johnson and won't be answered presumably by the next
case down the road.  The -- the question of whether
consensual sex offenses based on age should qualify, the
question of how offenses with recklessness should be
assessed, conspiracy to commit crimes of violence.
One of the easy cases that the government
highlights is solicitation to commit murder, but it's
really not that easy if conspiracy to commit a crime of
violence has two petitions pending before this Court
right now.  So the veneer of ease and simplicity that
the government attempts to create in their writing is
belied by the reality on the ground.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  A -- a different question,
and it's more for the government than for you.  As you
understand the government's position or is there common
ground between the parties that because this is a
mandatory increase, the standard for vagueness is
precisely the same as the standard that we applied and
determined whether or not a crime, in its definition, is
itself vague.
In other words, is there a different
vagueness standard for sentencing than for the -- a
statement of what a crime is at the outset?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I -- I don't think in this
case it deserves a lesser scrutiny because it's a
sentencing provision precisely because it's both
mandatory and onerous in the extreme.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's as if there were a
new crime.
MS. MENENDEZ:  It's as if there were a new
crime.  And I'm not talking about for other aspects of
this Court's jurisprudence, but for that question.
And I think frankly Flipside v. Hoffman
Estates itself suggests that criminal statutes deserve
greater scrutiny even though the licensing and mere fine
statute that gave rise to that statement of vague in
every application, they deserve greater scrutiny.  And
this is certainly one of the most onerous sentencing
penalties that we as Federal defenders face in our
practice.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You say the congressional
cure, as I understand your argument, could only be to
add to the list of crimes, to add to arson, extortion,
or to have whereas the -- an element of the crime is a
serious risk.  That's the only things that Congress
could do.  Nothing else.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Oh, no, Your Honor.  I don't
mean to suggest that at all.  Congress can fix this
however they see fit, and that's why it's a better
congressional function than asking one defense attorney
to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I asked what were the
routes that Congress could take.  One is to list every
crime that they think should get the enhanced penalty.
Another is to say this -- this statute has to have as an
element that the conduct creates a serious risk of
injury to others.  Sort of those two.  What could
Congress do?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Well, Your Honor, I don't
think listing them is that difficult.  Other
congressional enactments list a large number of things
that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm just saying, is there
anything else?  Let's accept listing is okay.  Saying
that the crime has to have as an element the risk of
danger to another.
MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I'm not trying to
avoid the question.  I think it depends on what they
want to accomplish.  If they want this to apply very
broadly to almost any sort of felony, they can say so.
If they want it to apply more narrowly to things that
are actually violent, they can say so.  The problem is
they didn't say much of anything when they wrote this
statute.  Those are the two ideas I have, but I'm sure
there are more.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I don't want to take up
your rebuttal time, but just this quick question.
If -- if Congress assigned a committee or a
person to go through the criminal code of every single
jurisdiction and identify those offenses that didn't
fall within any other provision of ACCA, but met, in the
judgment of those -- that individual or those
individuals, the residual clause standard, how many do
you think they would come up with?
MS. MENENDEZ:  I -- I --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Dozens?  Hundreds?
Thousands?
MS. MENENDEZ:  Again, I think it -- it
depends on whether Congress wants this to be a narrowly
applied enhancement for the worst of the worst or
broadly applied three strikes rule.  And I think if they
gave the commission that guidance instructed by this
Court's previous cases that show the hard areas of
questions, then the commission could decide.
I -- I don't think that it's necessary to
look at every State's code.  If they just specify the
definitions like they did for burglary and robbery in
the original 1984 enactment, that would save an enormous
amount of question, and it would preclude them from
having to look at each State's code.
And with the Court's permission, I'll save
my last moments.  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Dreeben.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Armed Career Criminal Act states, as
this Court noted in Sykes, a normative principle that
can be applied to various crimes with a methodology that
does not produce unconstitutional vagueness.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we didn't say
anything like that in Begay.
MR. DREEBEN:  I think the Court didn't
volunteer an opinion about the vagueness of the statute
in Begay.  It did comment on that in James, and it said
that it was not unconstitutional.  Sykes came later
after Begay, and the Court continued to adhere to the
idea that this statute can be applied as it has been
applied four times by the Court and in numerous
instances by lower courts without substantial
difficulty.
Now, I'm not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I didn't mean to
suggest in Begay we specifically addressed vagueness,
but the -- my -- my point was that Sykes provides a
particular test, but as your friend has pointed out,
Begay, it seems to me, points in an entirely different
direction.
MR. DREEBEN:  What Begay did was conclude
that the similarity of the offenses in the residual
clause to the enumerated offenses had to be more than
just similarity of risk; it also had to have a certain
similarity in kind.
In Sykes, the Court noted that the phrase
that the Court developed in Begay, "purposeful, violent
and aggressive," wasn't precisely linked to the text of
the statute, and it made clear that for offenses with a
mens rea of knowingly or intentionally risk levels
ordinarily provide the manageable test that courts can
apply.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true, but you see,
Begay sort of points to the problem in my mind.  There
is no doubt that drunk driving does cause a risk of
physical injury.  But could it be that Congress really
wanted to impose a 15-year mandatory minimum penalty to
a person who has two drunk driving offenses prior?  It
seemed outside the ballpark of what they're actually
interested in, and that's why I've had such a hard time,
I think we've had such a hard time with this in part
because of the sentence -- you know, a 15-year mandatory
minimum -- and in part, because there seems like they
had something in mind, but it's very hard to figure out.
MR. DREEBEN:  So I think, Justice Breyer,
that it may have been a little bit too ambitious for the
Court to try to develop a similarity-in-kind test
from --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- as the Court did in Begay.
That was the position of the government; four Justices
agreed with that, five did not.  We're not asking the
Court to revisit that today.
But once the Court did develop it, it then
considered in Sykes whether it provided a uniform,
universally applicable test --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And it doesn't.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- and concluded that it was
better to restrict it to crimes that involved
negligence, strict liability, recklessness, potentially,
so as not to allow it to basically subsume what's in the
statute.  And I think that having done that, the Court
has given guidance to the lower courts, there has been
some confusion that the Court, in its opinion in this
case, could clear up about the relationship between
Begay and the risk test.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that all it takes?  I
mean, can we just patch up this statute in ways that
have nothing to do with its text as -- as Begay didn't?
I -- I thought we did not have any common law power to
create crimes.  And if that's the case, it seems to me
it has to be Congress that's done that.
MR. DREEBEN:  So I agree with --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if Congress hasn't done
it, and it hasn't done it, clearly, it seems to me our
job is -- is over.
MR. DREEBEN:  So I agree with you, Justice
Scalia, that the Court does not have the power to create
common law crimes, and I don't think that it has done
that.  It's engaged in statutory construction about
which members of the Court may disagree.
Now, if the Court believes that a
similar-in-kind limitation is appropriate for ACCA,
there actually is a textual vehicle for getting there.
It's the same vehicle that Your Honor used in the other
Johnson case, the one about whether batteries involved
strong force or simply offensive touching, and Your
Honor looked to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Other laws.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- violent felony, the word
being defined, and concluded that the word "violent" in
that definition informed what kind of force would count.
And I think that that was the essential impulse of the
Court in the Begay case to distinguish between injuries
that are caused by regulatory type violations, like
pollution, and injuries that are caused in the way that
the statute specifies.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that --
that phrase, it seems to me, could just as clearly be
viewed as adding confusion.  And that's one -- the
various hundreds whatever statutes you cite, I don't
think -- certainly not many of them, I'm not sure any of
them, involved that aspect of it.  In other words, it's
not just a question of whether it's serious potential
risk, but otherwise, what is its relationship to the
enumerated offenses.
MR. DREEBEN:  So I think that that is not
such a big problem if the Court applies that the way
that it did in Sykes, and the way the lower courts
predominantly do.  It is not a precise statistical
empirical analysis.  Congress could not have envisioned
that this Court and the lower courts have available to
them statistics that for most crimes do not exist in
order to gauge risk levels.
It instead intended a judgment exercise,
based on experience, just like the Court did in Sykes.
And I want to remind the Court that eight members of the
Court agreed in Sykes, that flight in a vehicle from a
police officer in its ordinary case was sufficiently
risky to trigger the residual clause.  There was
disagreement because of the particular structure of the
Indiana statute, which had an enhanced offense that
involved vehicular flight that posed a risk of
something.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what you mean
by a judgment exercised based on experience.  What --
what experience do I have regarding these innumerable
State crimes?  I -- I've not heard any case involving
any of those State crimes.  What -- what experience are
you asking me to apply?
MR. DREEBEN:  I think the same kind of
logical judgment that the lower courts have used, and
let me give an example --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's not
experience.  I mean, logic is not an experience.  You're
asking me to apply logic or experience.  Which is it?
MR. DREEBEN:  Both.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Both.  Well, what's the
experience part?
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, it may be a little bit
easier if I start with the logic point, and I promise I
will get to the experience point.
The logic point involves looking at the
elements of the offense and asking, what does the
conduct in this offense consist of?  Let me take an
example which my friend on the other side has not
challenged:  Solicitation of a child under the age of 14
to engage in sodomy.
Now, a court can look at that conduct and
say what that requires is that an adult attempt to
entice a child to a private place to engage in a sex
act.  Is that the kind of act that is likely, as a
matter of logic and ordinary human experience -- adults
are bigger than children, sodomy requires physical
contact -- is it likely to produce a serious potential
risk of physical injury to another?
Courts do not have very much difficulty
answering that question.  Similarly, in cases of
kidnapping, you ask what does it mean?  Somebody is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suggest they have not
much difficulty because it's a horrific crime, not
because they have any basis for saying, you know, what
the degree of risk of serious -- potential -- a serious
potential risk of injury is.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I don't think that they
have to say with precision what the degree of risk is.
Congress gave four exemplar crimes to try to illustrate
what it had in mind.  Two of them, burglary and
extortion, involve conduct that's directed against
property or potentially a threat of a person.  And the
danger that can arise is of confrontation; if the
burglar encounters somebody at the home, if the
extortionist attempts to realize the threat.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right, I see that.
Now, wait, before -- because I want you to get back to
the experience.  The thing also that sticks in my mind
was  that Indiana case.  Do you remember the one I'm
talking about?  Because -- because, in fact, you look at
the words, but they're nested -- you see they're nested
in a set of other crimes.
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And really you'd like to
know an empirical fact, how is this bit of a larger nest
actually used in Indiana?  It might be that it's really
used against people who are involved in a violent kind
of situation, or it might not be, because there are a
whole lot of other ones around.
And now you turn to experience and say, use
experience -- you know, I have no idea whatsoever.  And
Posner has suggested, I think I picked that up, go and
do some empirical research; why doesn't the government
do it?  The Sentencing Commission has tried to do it.
It can't start.  It doesn't know where to begin, there
are so many statutes.
MR. DREEBEN:  So I think, Justice Breyer,
the very difficulty and unmanageability of the
enterprise suggests that it's not what Congress had in
mind.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.
MR. DREEBEN:  What Congress had in mind was
identifying classes of offenses that judges are
confident involve serious potential risks of physical
injury to another, possibly the similarity-in-kind
inquiry when the mens rea isn't satisfied.  And what
Congress expected courts to do was to analyze what the
conduct is that's involved in it, compare it to the
listed offenses, and see if the risks are similar.  I --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that -- that sounds --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does the Department of
Justice do any of that?  I mean, an ACCA sentence, as I
understand it, is one that the prosecutor asks for.  And
is there any guidance coming from the Department of
Justice, guidance to the U.S. attorneys who are going to
be asking for ACCA sentences, when they should and when
they shouldn't?
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, and the guidance keys,
Justice Ginsburg, off this Court's decisions.  We use
primarily an analysis that focuses on looking at the
conduct that the elements of the crimes embrace, and
logically analyzing what does it entail?  Does it entail
a risk of confrontation?
The other kind of risk that's subsumed --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there -- is there
written guidance --
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- from the Department of
Justice to the U.S. attorneys?
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, there is, in the form of
guidance memos that we regard as work product, but they
involve analytical efforts to separate different
offenses into different categories, based on the
conduct.
And to the extent that statistics come into
play, and I know that, Justice Breyer, your opinions
have cited statistics, you've talked about the needs for
statistics, we think that they play the -- exactly the
role that the Court used them for in Sykes.  First, the
Court talked in Sykes about what happens when someone
pleas -- flees from a police officer.  What are the
risks of --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, but what about
extortion?  I mean, extortion, that doesn't -- I mean,
the other three I can see; burglary, arson, explosives,
sure.  But what about extortion?  I thought the -- it's
like Hobbs Act, and I would be amazed if many of those
involve violence, but you would know.  Do they -- are
there --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Violence by the
extortion -- extortee.  I mean, it certainly is not the
first --
JUSTICE BREYER:  He's at the other end of a
postal communication, or something.  I mean, they say,
if you don't give me some money, I will, you know -- and
I'm in New York, you're in Hawaii, I'm going to reveal
such and such.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What are the facts on that?
MR. DREEBEN:  I think that what Congress had
in mind was the kind of extortion where somebody
threatens to inflict injury on a person or property.
And if it's -- in order to achieve a demand.  And
Congress was concerned that the person who makes that
threat poses a risk of carrying it out, which creates a
degree of danger.  It's the confront --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that the Justice
Department's position, that other extortion is not
covered by the provision?
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I don't think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it's just blackmail, you
threaten to reveal something about the person's life --
MR. DREEBEN:  I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that isn't covered.
MR. DREEBEN:  We would argue that the
generic definition of extortion is seeking to get some
property from a person with his consent by the use of
threats, force or fear.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Threat -- threats or force.
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You add or fear.
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I mean, fear includes
being afraid that some events of your prior life will
be --
MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.  And --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so you -- you don't
assert that extortion means only the extortion that --
that the mafia might -- you know, pay up or -- or we're
going to hurt you.
MR. DREEBEN:  I -- I think a normal method
of statutory construction doesn't quite get you to the
narrower view of extortion that you expressed in your
separate opinion in James I believe, but that is a legal
question.  I mean, the government might make that
argument and this Court might conclude that under the
principle that similar words should be construed
similarly, extortion has a narrower meaning in this
statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  But the problem
is -- the problem is not what the government argues when
it gets into court.  The problem is what the prosecutor
threatens when he's entered into plea bargain
negotiations.  This is the point that Justice Ginsburg
touched on.  You are putting the defense counsel in a
position where they have to interpret the vagueness in
making the decision when -- whether they want to plead
to five years or risk the mandatory minimum of -- of 15.
And your guidelines say a lot, but I thought
one of the things your guidelines say is that you should
prosecute the -- the maximum extent that you can, right?
Isn't it you should charge the maximum if you -- if you
charge and then the prosecutors go in and say, look, I
could charge you this much and -- or I could -- or I
could -- I mean, I could add this charge to what I've
got and then you'd face 15 years.  And defense counsel
said, well, all right.  Let me see if we're guilty of
that.  And he's going to read that and have no idea
whether they're covered by it or not.
MR. DREEBEN:  I think no idea is not quite
right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No idea is an
exaggeration, sure.
MR. DREEBEN:  It is an exaggeration and this
may not completely answer --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not enough of an --
not enough of an idea to risk an extra ten years for
their client.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, these aren't charges in
the same way that a criminal charge is that's brought in
the indictment.  Typically, criminal history isn't even
assembled until after the defendant has pleaded guilty
and a presentence report is being prepared.  And at that
point the parties are more aware of whether the
defendant might be exposed to the Armed Career Criminal
Act or not.  Sometimes ex ante analysis is done and can
be done fairly reliably.
Again, this Court sees cases that really
pose hard questions; that have generated circuit splits
that result in legal questions that have divided the
lower courts.  There is a wealth of activity below the
surface that doesn't get to this Court in which there
isn't nearly as much difficulty in figuring it out.
Now, on pages 8 and 9 of our brief, which my
friend referred to several times, we cited 17 examples
of what we thought are easy cases.  In the reply brief,
the Petitioner came back and said, well, three of those
really aren't easy because they're circuit splits.  In
two of them, the splits are really because the
definitions, the offenses, the elements of the offenses
were quite different.  Child abuse meant something very
different in one jurisdiction from another.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you -- you take the
position so long as there's some easy cases, the statute
can't be vague.
MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think the Court has to
go nearly that far, Justice Scalia, because in this case
you have four cases --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you -- you don't take
that position?
MR. DREEBEN:  This Court's decision --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought your brief took
that position.
MR. DREEBEN:  This Court's decisions do
suggest that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think the Court has to
go all the way to that position in order to conclude --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what is the standard?
And this goes back to what Justice Scalia was saying
before.  I mean, there's conduct that everybody agrees
is annoying.  There are rates that everybody agrees are
just -- are unjust and unreasonable.  So how much do we
have to say that the core has shrunk and the margins
have taken over before we're willing to do this?
MR. DREEBEN:  So I think the starting point,
Justice Kagan, is to look at whether the statute states
something of an objective standard or a subjective
standard.  So in the instance of unreasonable rates,
that is a standard that -- an administrative agency
could -- could flesh that out.  But for a court to do it
would really just involve an -- an application of
subjectivity.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I feel as though it's
really the same inquiry.  I mean, even as you describe
it, it's identify crimes where there -- you know,
dangerous stuff, crimes that pose a risk of -- of
danger.
How much danger?  Well, as much danger as
these four enumerated offenses.  How much danger do they
pose?  Well, nobody's really sure.  One of them seems
only to pose that a lot of danger in a few select cases.
So it's a really -- it just seems, even as you describe
it, as the kind of thing that Congress ought to be
doing.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, let me add one thing,
Justice Kagan, to your description of what courts should
do when they apply this analysis.  First, they're going
to look to see if they can identify the ordinary case.
Then they're going to try to determine whether the risk
is essentially, I think, analogous to the burglary
extortion risk of confrontation or the arson explosives
risk of unleashing a direct -- a destructive force.  And
then finally there may be some cases where the Begay
analysis applies.
But this is the really important point that
I want Your Honor to think about in this context:  If
the Court is not satisfied that on any one of those
issues, the government loses.  Not because the statute
is vague, but because if the Court is not confident that
an offense fits within the -- a normative criteria that
Congress has established, the tie goes to the defendant.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So there's no so much thing
as a vague statute.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, no.  I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying whenever the
statute is vague, the government loses on the Rule of
Lenity; therefore, there's no such thing as a vague
statute.
MR. DREEBEN:  I think the kinds of things
that are vague statutes as reflected in this Court's
opinions are either those where there's a tinge of First
Amendment or other protected activity, like in the
annoying example, or cases like L. Cohen where the
standard is unreasonable rates.  And sure, everybody
would agree that some rates are unreasonable, but it's
a -- it's a very subjective standard.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what do you
think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The hardest -- the hardest
part of this -- of this test is determining what is the
typical case of -- of -- of this particular violation.
What is the typical case of extortion?  To take one of
the four enumerated case-- what is the typical case of
extortion?  You seem to think the typical case is the --
you know, I'll break your leg unless you pay up.  See, I
would have thought the typical case is, you know,
I'll -- I'll disclose something about your -- your life
unless you pay up.
MR. DREEBEN:  And I think that if the Court
is faced with that kind of conundrum, it looks to
reported decisions of convicted cases, as the Court
indicated in James, and it attempts to determine whether
it can identify the ordinary convicted case.  And if it
cannot conclude that the ordinary case involves the
greater degree of violence, then it will conclude that
the government has not prevailed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about one that
you think is easy, kidnapping?  What if the statistics
would ever show that in 40 percent of the cases, they're
talking about the parent that does not have custodial
rights, you know, taking the child from school and
not -- not returning him or her, whatever.  I mean, that
doesn't pose, I would say, not a serious risk of
potential violence.  The parent is not going to harm --
harm -- harm the child.  And yet you say that's an easy
case.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe it's easy if
it's at the margin, if one percent of the cases are.  I
don't know whether kidnapping is prosecuted more often
in a case like that or in another, you know, more, you
know, violent case where it's extortion for money as
opposed to just wanting more custody of the child.
MR. DREEBEN:  So we -- we would have to
undertake the effort to try to persuade a court of what
we thought the ordinary case was.  And if we failed, if
we did not muster whatever the Court thought it needed
to understand that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But how do you --
how do you do that?  Do you look at every charged case
of kidnapping in the State of Arkansas, if it involves a
law from Arkansas?
MR. DREEBEN:  We would look at the reported
cases in Arkansas.  We would look to see whether --
JUSTICE BREYER:
The problem is --
JUSTICE KAGAN:
Mr. Dreeben --
JUSTICE BREYER:
The -- the reported cases.
But you know -- you know,
No.  I want to just get to
Justice Kagan's earlier question, if that's all right.
Is it?  Okay.
Because for the reasons that you've heard,
I'd just like you spend now or sometime before you sit
down, a minute on the suggestion of limiting it through
the use of the -- your appendix, which you heard
described a minute ago.
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Because looking at the
language, I think it is possible within the language to
go to that interpretation.
MR. DREEBEN:  So I don't really think that
that interpretation is correct, because if you look at
the exemplar crimes --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what you're
talking about.
MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  What I'm
talking about specifically --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What interpretation?
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- is you read the words,
"Otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious
potential risk of physical injury to another."  You look
at the four examples.  You say in each of the four
examples there was a jury determination that it fell
within one of the four, and we should read those words,
too, as requiring a jury to make a determination that
there's a serious potential risk.  And the way you do
that is that you insist that an element of the crime has
the words, or the equivalent, of "serious potential
risk."
Now, that's roughly what the suggestion was
on the other side.  I just didn't want you to sit down
and -- at any point you'd like without -- without
addressing that possibility.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I -- I can address it
quickly, Justice Breyer, because I don't think that it
is a construction of the statute that really works.  The
exemplar crimes like --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  She didn't
propose it as a construction of the statute.  She said
very clearly that this Court could not adopt that, but
that Congress could.  She was asked, you know, how
Congress could fix this.  That was her proposal about
how Congress could fix it --
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes Justice Scalia, I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm asking you as a saving
construction.
MR. DREEBEN:  I just wanted to -- I think we
agree with Petitioner on this one, that the exemplar
crimes, burglary, extortion, arson, and so forth, don't
involve as an element characteristically serious
potential risk of physical injury to another.  It arises
because of the elements of the crime.  And the residual
clause, which was originally where ACCA came from as a
freestanding clause, and then the exemplars were added
back in before it was passed --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- illustrates --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Go back to Justice Kagan.
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  So that -- that I think
is not really a viable solution to it, but I do think
that the viable solution in this area is that for many
crimes, they -- they don't pose the empirical conundrums
that can be hypothesized.  And when they do and the
government is not able to satisfy the Court or the Court
isn't through its own research able to become satisfied
that it is a fix on the ordinary case, that it can say
with some degree of confidence that the risk is
comparable to the exemplar crimes, the crime falls out.
And so you have in the ACCA world many
crimes that no one ever contests are covered; mail
fraud, gambling.  And then you have crimes that we have
listed that are not seriously contested.  We listed 17
of them.  They contested 3.  I think two of the contests
really have to be set aside  but with --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I think even --
MR. DREEBEN:  -- are different -- please.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I think even in the
ones that you think are easy, they're only easy in the
abstract.
The vehicular flight one was a good example
of that.  In the abstract, everybody just has a sense
that it's really dangerous if people flee from a police
officer in a car.  But then it turns out there are all
kinds of degrees and we have zero idea what the charging
is.  And I think that that's not -- that was not a fluke
of that case.  That's kind of every case, is that we
don't have a sense of how all the statutes connect to
each other and what statutes are used for the dangerous
ones and what statutes are used for more minor variants
of the same offenses, and that that's kind of an endemic
problem in this.  Is that not right?
MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Kagan, I think what
the Court is asking itself when it attempts to apply
ACCA is not a question at that fine-grained level of
empirical precision.  Congress understood, for example,
that in most burglaries, probably nobody is hurt.  Many
extortions, nobody realizes the threat.  And yet, it
regarded the kind of person who is willing to undertake
a crime that could lead to that kind of confrontation as
properly subject to an enhanced sentence when they have
not just one, but two other convictions, and then they
go out and use a gun.  This --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but then you're
talking about a very different inquiry, it seems to me.
Then you're talking about just a gut check.  Do -- do,
like, people that -- is this the kind of conduct that a
bad person engages in?
MR. DREEBEN:  No.  I don't think that it's
quite that amorphous.  There is a much more specific
inquiry into the risk, and the way the courts have
conducted it I think is really -- you know, in this
Court's decision in Sykes was an exemplar, but there are
many, many, many other cases where the lower courts look
at the conduct, they examine the conduct, is this a sex
crime that involves a minor and an adult?  What is
likely to ensue?
And I think that it's kind of critical to
keep a perspective here that the idea of substantial
risk is shot through criminal law.  The very
definition --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That -- that brings me to
the statutes in your appendix.  It did -- it does seem
to me that those statutes do require a case-by-case
determination by the finder of fact that there was a
danger in the particular case.
MR. DREEBEN:  So there --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so -- and so that --
that's different from --
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- from a categorical
approach.
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  And, Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And most of those
statutes, it seemed to me, would survive if -- if this
Court ruled against you here.
MR. DREEBEN:  It depends on the rationale,
Justice Kennedy, because if the rationale were the
concept of substantial risk is itself too amorphous to
be grasped at all and to be applied in any kind of a
consistent manner, I think that would raise serious
questions.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We would never say that.
We would never say that.
MR. DREEBEN:  But I think as a logical
matter, that's essentially what Petitioner is saying,
that it's not possible to really get a fix on what those
words mean.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  He's saying -- she's
saying that you can't tell what the typical crime is,
and when you can't tell what the typical crime is, you
can't tell what -- what -- what the risk is.
MR. DREEBEN:  And my answer to that is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just as you can't do it for
extortion.
MR. DREEBEN:  If you can't tell what the
typical crime is, the government loses.  Once you can
tell what the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not really an
answer.  That sounds wonderful.  The government loses
because of the -- the -- the rule that the tie goes to
the defendant.  That sounds wonderful, but the fact is
one court will say, yes, the government loses.  Another
court, given the vagueness of it, will say the
government wins.
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  I -- I don't think
that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are we going to have to
review every one of these until the law is clear?
MR. DREEBEN:  No.  I think the Court does
what it typically does, which is to review cases and
establish general principles, and the lower courts make
an effort to harmonize their rulings in light of them.
It's not unique that this statute has
generated a lot of litigation.  Section 924(c), for
example, this Court has had three different cases
interpreting the meaning of the word "use" and one
interpreting the word "carry."  I mean, that's a higher
ratio of cases to words than this statute, but I think
what it says is that when there's a lot at stake, when
many years of prison time are at stake, people litigate
hard.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is the test the same here
for vagueness as when we're determining the validity of
a statute that specifies a crime?
MR. DREEBEN:  So I don't think that's so
clear, Justice Kennedy.  This Court in Chapman indicated
that there's a lesser degree of -- of clarity required
for vagueness doctrine in the sentencing context.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why should that be when
it's a mandatory -- this is mandatory, and has
five years, no possibility -- and this case is such a
good illustration because the judge said, If it were up
to me, this person should get half or most -- what did
he say -- two-thirds, that would more than suffice, but
I'm locked into this by ACCA.
Shouldn't we demand from Congress, if it
wants to have that kind of enhancement, a really clear
statement?
MR. DREEBEN:  Let me say two things about
that, Justice Ginsburg.  One is that this statue
involves recidivism.  There -- the -- there was never
any question that Petitioner should have had about what
conduct was prohibited and not prohibited.  He knew or
should have known that he could not possess a gun.
And the second thing is because this statute
is applied as a matter of law by courts with de novo
appellate review, it achieves a degree of clarity
through the litigation process that, I think, is going
to be sufficient to meet whatever heightened standard
the Court might impose on it.
But I do want to come back --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Before you do,
just -- because I disagree with the statement you made.
You said if there's -- because there are so
many years involved, people will litigate hard.  I think
because there are so many years involved, people won't
litigate at all.  I mean, if -- if they're facing
when -- if they go to trial such a large enhancement, I
think they're going to be compelled -- it gives so much
more power to the prosecutor in the plea negotiations
which is, of course, where almost all of the cases are
disposed of.
MR. DREEBEN:  And not so much here for two
reasons, Mr. Chief Justice.  One is that section 922(g)
prohibits possession of a weapon by a firearm.  And I'm
not going to say that there are no contested cases, but
it's not the hardest crime to prove.  If you're found in
a car with a gun and the suppression motion fails, trial
is not going to get you a lot.
The second thing is it's not totally up to
the prosecutor.  The presentence report will indicate
the defendant's criminal history, and the judge is
obligated to apply ACCA whether or not the government
asks for it to be applied if, in fact, it is legally
applicable.  So I don't think that this context presents
quite the same plea bargaining pressure that Your Honor
had in mind.  But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How is the government
going to know about the prior crimes unless the
government -- and how is the judge supposed to know
about the prior crimes unless the prosecutor tells the
court?
MR. DREEBEN:  The -- may I answer, Mr. Chief
Justice?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.
MR. DREEBEN:  The -- the presentence report
which is required to be prepared by the probation
officer does a criminal history check, gathers that
information, synthesizes it, makes recommendations to
the sentencing court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Menendez, you
have three minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE M. MENENDEZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. MENENDEZ:  Thank you, Your Honor, Mr.
Chief Justice.  Just briefly, Your Honor.
First, I think lenity is an illusory
solution in this case.  After the government suggested
lenity is the answer, we looked through every opinion we
could find from the courts of appeals and the district
court.  We did not find a single case nationwide where a
court has applied lenity to find that a marginal case
should not count under the residual clause.  So if
lenity is going to pose the solution that the government
suggests, it needs substantial invigoration by this
Court to be the -- the answer in the gray areas.
The second thought is that this suggestion
that the Court can decide what the ordinary case is from
reported decisions is actually also skewed in favor of
the government.  Consider a -- consider a standard
offense where somebody commits a much less egregious
case; resisting arrest where all they do is refused to
be handcuffed versus resisting arrest where they kick
and punch and fight the officer.  This case is likely to
get a higher sentence and more likely to lead to appeals
and challenges and a reported decision.  This case is
perhaps more likely to be resolved with a suspended
sentence and never to appear in the reported case law at
all.
So if all we're doing is turning to the
reported case law to try to determine what the ordinary
case is, that's going to give an artificially skewed
sense of the aggressive nature of those cases.
Finally, Your Honors, while it's true that
this Court has grappled with things like 924(c)
repeatedly, 924(c) provides an example of what's
supposed to happen, which is when this Court points out
a flaw in a statute, which they have -- Your Honors have
now done four different times, Congress answered.
Change 924(c) to try to address the Court's decision and
address the Court's concerns from Bailey.  And then that
answer has led to additional questions.
That give and take, that discourse is
missing in this case, where it's been clear for a long
time that this statute needs help, and there's been
inaction on the part of Congress.  Your Honors, I think
that the idea that the tie should go to the defendant is
important, but it's just not happening, because of the
subjective gut check that Your Honor has mentioned.
Judges substitute a feeling, boy, a sexual
offense involving a minor sounds bad, and it sounds
violent, so therefore, it must count.  But I'd invite
Your Honors to look at the footnote in our brief where
we highlight that there's actually several cases that
find that where the offense is -- or is unlawful because
of the age of the victim, it doesn't count as a violent
offense.  So that gut check has to mean -- has to be
more quantified, it has to be limited, it has to have
specific guidance.
The last point I'd like to make, Your
Honors, is that whether this Court decides in favor of
Mr. Johnson on the merits or an application of the Rule
of Lenity, whether this Court decides that this statute
is unconstitutionally vague as applied to possessory
offenses, or as applied to mere possession of a
short-barrel shotgun, or whether this Court takes the
step that I think it's time for, and declares this
clause unconstitutionally vague, in every instance, I
think the appropriate result is for Mr. Johnson to win
and be resentenced.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
