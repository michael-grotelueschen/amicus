CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Company v. White.
Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
There is no more vexing set of issues in the
employment discrimination context than arise out of
issues of retaliation under section 704 of title VII.
As the Solicitor General's brief and a couple of the
other amici briefs point out, the number of -- the
number of these claims has increased by more than 100
percent over the course of the last decade, more than
percent of the EEOC's docket is now made up of
retaliation claims, and the cost of an average
contested retaliation claim exceeds $130,000 per case.
Plainly, this is a fundamentally important question,
and the standard to be applied under section 704 is
critically important to both employers and employees.
And the Respondent has given you truly a
choice and not a shadow in this particular case because
the Respondent's analysis of section 704, based
essentially on the language, any discrimination, is
that everything that is in any sense against an
employee, any act of retaliation, no matter how
trivial, is nevertheless a basis for a section 704
lawsuit.
This is a position that's embraced by none of
her supporting amici. It's a position that's been
embraced by no court of appeals up until this point,
and it is a position that is utterly untethered in the
relationship between section 704 and its language and
section 703, which is the heart and soul of the anti-
discrimination norms in title VII.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It has been endorsed
by the EEOC, though.
MR. PHILLIPS: Not -- not that broad -- no,
not even the EEOC in its most aggressive
interpretation, which obviously the United States has
rejected in this case, ever went to the point of saying
any. And I'll give you a good illustration of that
because in the guidelines, the commission always said
that in a situation where there was absolutely no
question of retaliation, charge filed against a
supervisor, supervisor disinvites an employee to lunch,
a lunch that's held with all the other employees -- it
has always been the position of the -- of the EEOC that
in that circumstance, that would not be enough to raise
even a fact issue to go to a jury on.
Under the Respondent's theory of this case,
it is clear to me that being disinvited to a lunch
would, in fact, be a basis for a Federal lawsuit under
section 704.
So there is no one, neither governmental nor
nongovernmental, that has embraced the extreme position
that the Respondent has put forward under section 704.
And indeed, it's very difficult for me to
understand why Congress would ever have adopted a rule
that was more protective of those against whom --
against -- where retaliation takes place as opposed to
the core of who was protected by section 703, which is
the people who are in the protected class in the first
instance.
To adopt the rule, I think, of the Respondent
in this case would not only increase the number of
claims another 100 percent, at least, in the future,
but it seems to me would render completely meaningless
the observation of this Court in Weber that management
prerogatives are to be left undisturbed to the greatest
extent possible. There are no management prerogatives
once an employee has filed a complaint under -- and,
therefore, is protected under section 704. At that
point, everything becomes essentially a straitjacket
problem.
I don't think there's a rationale to support
that interpretation, and so therefore the question is,
what is the right standard under section 704?
And here, it seems to me the United States
and Burlington Northern are on exactly the same page.
We believe that this Court announced the appropriate
standard under section 703 in dealing with harassment
cases. That's the Ellerth standard, and we believe
that the Ellerth standard is the proper one for
defining a tangible employment action.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But 703 has the language and
4 doesn't. I mean, 703 has language limiting it to
-- to employment, prerogatives of employment. 704
doesn't.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Justice Scalia, this
Court has also said that that negative pregnant has
never been used as an overarching interpretive guide.
You have to evaluate 703 and 704 in tandem, and it
seems much easier to interpret 704 as simply using
discrimination against as a shorthand for the wide
range of discriminations that are outlined in section
3. It seems quite cumbersome, at a minimum, and
probably worse if Congress were to actually sit down
and try to rewrite every aspect of 703 in order simply
to say in addition to the protected classes that 703
protects, there is certain conduct under 704 that we
protect in exactly the same way that we protect --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No. It wouldn't have to do
-- I mean, fairly -- you know, to be fair, it wouldn't
have had to say that. It would have said any -- any
act that is discrimination under 703. Any act that is
discrimination under 703. Seven words it could have
said.
MR. PHILLIPS: They could have said it that
way, but it seems to me quite clear that Congress still
intended for 703 and 704 to be interpreted in pari
materia. And -- and again, you -- you still run into
the same problem, Justice Scalia, as to why is it that
Congress would want to protect more thoroughly 704
plaintiffs than it would 703 plaintiffs. And it seems
to me there's no --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a curiosity. It is.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the answer would be
because Congress is worried that people won't complain.
That's why. And there are millions of ways of
harassing people. They start issuing a complaint. You
do all kinds of things. You freeze them out. You --
you insult them. You -- I mean, it's easy to think of
things that don't rise to the level of the -- Ellerth.
So, I mean, if I -- maybe I'm right, maybe
I'm wrong, but if I'm right, why not just take, say,
the D.C. Circuit standard? They -- they say that you
have to show that the employer's action would have been
material, which means the action might well have
dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting
a charge of discrimination.  Now, how about that? That
has the virtue of allowing a person not to be harassed,
et cetera, who wants to make a complaint, and it also
allows the judge to focus on the particular case and
see if what the person is doing is reasonable. It
holds the complainant to a standard of reasonableness,
which is common in law.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And the issue would be, I
assume, how much a reasonable person likes a free
lunch.
MR. PHILLIPS: That would be -- that would be
the question.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, in fact, if it turns
out to be the power lunch of all time and, in fact, the
person can't be at the power lunch because she's a
woman, for example, and therefore, her future career is
likely to take a real nose dive, why shouldn't that
count as a violation?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I will tell you, Justice
Breyer, that the -- at least one of the problems with
that is that the EEOC's guidelines expressly state that
that is not a claim that's actionable under section
4.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They say one lunch, but
not if there's a weekly lunch, and the only person who
gets left out is the person who filed a charge under
title VII. That's -- a one-at-a-time curiosity the
EEOC guidelines leave out, but if it's a routine lunch
with all the preferred employees and they leave out the
one who filed a title VII charge, that would fit
within the EEOC's definition.
MR. PHILLIPS: That would fit under the
EEOC's definition, although I don't think it's an
answer to Justice Breyer's hypothetical --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wouldn't fit under
your --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- that was talking the big
power lunch.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Under your definition,
lunch is lunch, and so there would never be -- there
couldn't be --
MR. PHILLIPS: No, not under my -- no, that's
not necessarily the case, Justice Ginsburg. In my --
you know, there are two standards under -- under an
adverse employment action. The first one is whether
there's a tangible action, and that's the Ellerth
standard. And then there's always the pervasive and
severe standard, so that if you have -- you know, being
routinely excluded rises to the level of pervasive or
severe, that would still be actionable under 704 in
exactly the same way that that's actionable under 703.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, does it or doesn't
it? The -- the facts are simply that the manager takes
out all the employees, except this one that filed the
title VII charge, once a week. Is that --
MR. PHILLIPS: And -- and does it on a
pervasive basis, sustained and pervasive basis.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it once a week, and
I'm not using any adjective to characterize it. It
just happens once a week.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think you probably
have a jury question at some point, depending on how
long it went on for because it would become -- it would
become a pervasive practice. And under those
circumstances, this Court has a rule that allows that
to become a jury issue. But if it's only once or
twice, it strikes me that that's not a particular
--
problem.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how about excluding
from the forklift forever or a year? You can't work
the forklift for a year.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- the reason why
that's not a problem is that there is no economic
effect that attaches to not working on the forklift for
a year or for 10 years.  The -- the proof in this case
is absolutely clear.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it has an effect on
your back.
MR. PHILLIPS: But that was not the -- but
the -- but she didn't get hired as a forklift operator.
She was hired as a track laborer, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but you've got a jury
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but if that argument
is sound --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you've got a jury
finding here. You've got a jury finding this was
discriminatory.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there's -- there's no
question that there's a jury finding of retaliation.
The question is whether or not this is a tangible
employment action.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but if your -- if your
argument is sound, Mr. Phillips, then -- then any
employer is well advised to define job categories by
having one really nice job within the category and one
really rotten job within the category. And if anybody
who's got the nice job does something like make a title
VII complaint, automatically gets, in effect,
reassigned to the rotten job, and your answer will be,
you know, there's no economic effect. They're getting
the same amount of money each week. I mean, that would
seem to me -- asks for an end run around the whole
concept of retaliation.
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Souter, let me -- in
the first place, it's not a very practical hypothetical
because, one, when you -- when you define your job
positions --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't there a
big difference between sitting on a seat and running a
forklift and -- and picking up steel rails with your
bare hands?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, one, she wasn't
typically picking up steel rails with her bare hands.
All of this stuff is done mechanically. She was
pulling nails out of rails periodically. So I'm not
sure that that's precisely the way to characterize it.
But the -- but at the end of the day, it
still seems to me that what Ellerth tells you you
should look at is primarily whether there is a -- a
direct economic effect. And if there is no direct
economic effect, then what you ought to be looking for
is whether or not the -- the conduct is severe or
pervasive, and -- and if it is --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- then, it seems to me,
there's a separate action. But that's not the claim
she brought in this case.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but do you -- do you
agree that direct economic effect cannot be the only
criterion here?
MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think it can be
the only criterion. I think that you would have a
situation -- and a lot of times the -- the economic
effect will be either immediate or potentially indirect
in the sense of the hypothetical the commission uses in
its guidelines where a butcher is shifted over to be a
cashier. And in that situation, that's a fundamentally
different job with a fundamentally different career
path. And it may not have any economic effects in the
short run, but in the long run, it will have. And that
may be an answer in part to your question, Justice
Souter, about just one big job classification that --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this
hypothetical? Supposing people like to work the
forklift, but nobody had a -- a right to do it, but
they traded every day or something like that, and the
company put out a notice that said anybody who -- who
files a claim will not be eligible to ride on the
forklift ever again.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. That's a quid pro quo
violation.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That would be a violation?
MR. PHILLIPS: This Court held in -- in
Ellerth that those kinds of quid pro quos are -- are
subject to liability.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So anytime there's an
advance notice that you will -- there will be some kind
of action in response to a -- a claim, that would be
retaliation.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, because the employer --
I mean, employers aren't going to --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Even though it was not an
adverse job action.
MR. PHILLIPS: -- adopt that kind of a
standard.
I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Even though it did not
amount to -- did not have any economic effect on the
employee.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, in that -- you know, in
-- under those circumstances, it seems to me that the
standard is slightly different for quid pro quo
violations than they are for simply tangible employment
actions.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So a quid pro quo violation
does not have to be an adverse employment action.
MR. PHILLIPS: It -- right, because the --
there are -- I mean, they are all adverse employment
actions. There's a tangible employment action.
There's a quid pro quo action, and then there's the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that -- that
interpretation requires you to interpret 703 and 704
differently.
MR. PHILLIPS: No. I -- I don't believe so
because I'm -- I'm -- what I'm trying to do at least is
to apply the Ellerth standard under 703 for each of the
three elements in the same way that I'm trying to apply
them under 704.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but are you? I'm --
I'm a little concerned that -- that you're trying to
persuade us to interpret 704 the same as 703 at the
--
expense of watering down 703. I don't understand how
you can concede that -- that refusing to invite
somebody to lunch, if it's more than -- more than a
single lunch, could be a violation of 703. How does
that come within the -- with respect to compensation,
terms, conditions, or privileges of employment?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think that if -- if
you could certainly envision a circumstance -- and
again, this goes to the pervasiveness of it. It's --
it's a fundamental, sort of constructive adjustment of
your employment situation. Terms and conditions is a
fairly capacious term, Justice Scalia, and I could well
imagine that if you were being systematically treated
differently and differently from every other employee
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not by the --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- then at some point it
becomes severe or pervasive in a way that -- that, it
would seem to me, would raise a jury trial issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and going to lunch is
the conditions of employment.
MR. PHILLIPS: Going to lunch once, no.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Privilege.
MR. PHILLIPS: Going to lunch twice, I'm sure
not. But, you know, if it is a continuous process, at
some point it strikes me that it would become somewhat
problematic. Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But let's get the --
MR. PHILLIPS: But -- and that is why it's
important, and it goes back to Justice Breyer's
question, if I can go back to that for a second,
because he asked about the D.C. Circuit's opinion,
which, you know, of course, adopted the EEOC's now-
discredited theory of this case and, again, untethers
3 from 704. That's the problem with the D.C.
Circuit's interpretation.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? You see, I can
think of a million things. I can't think literally of
a million, but it does seem --
MR. PHILLIPS: I suspect you could, actually.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: -- to me there are many,
many possible ways of really discouraging a worker from
complaining that are not quite as tangible as the list
under 703. So the D.C. Circuit -- and I think even the
SG here, which seems like a variation of the D.C.
Circuit -- much -- the standards seem much -- not as
different as you might -- as it seems to me you're
saying. But -- but they're -- they're trying to be a
little vaguer and a bit broader than the specific
Ellerth language because they recognize there are many
possible ways of seriously injuring a person with the
intent or -- to stop them from complaining. That gives
effect to the language differences.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: It leaves it up to case-by-
case. It leaves it up to the administrative agency,
all in areas where I frankly don't know one lunch from
another.
MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know one lunch from
another often, but the -- the EEOC might and -- and so
might a judge who hears evidence.
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER: And that's the virtue of
their standard.
MR. PHILLIPS: -- I mean, you can ask Mr.
Garre what his view is with respect to the waiting on
the position of the Solicitor General here.
But it still seems to me that there is a
fundamental difference between the way the D.C. Circuit
is analyzing this case and -- and the way this Court
analyzed it Ellerth. And the fundamental difference is
-- I agree with you. There are other circumstances
that are not tangible employment actions that are,
nevertheless, actionable under both 703 and 704, but
those are -- those are taken care of under the Meritor
standards. The -- the assumption is that they are both
retaliatory in purpose and that they are severe or
pervasive.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the --
MR. PHILLIPS: When you reach that standard,
then you create a question of fact for the jury.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what about the Seventh
Circuit case that posed the question of same job, same
character of work, except that the employee had flex
time, which enabled her to take care of her disabled
child when she could leave at 3:00, and she's just
changed to -- same job except it's got to be 9:00 to
:00. Would that fit within your definition?
MR. PHILLIPS: I doubt it actually, Justice
Ginsburg, because I think typically mere
inconveniences, even -- even significant
inconveniences, have traditionally been rejected as
bases for taking an issue to the jury.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the jury has
made a finding that the only reason that was done was
in retaliation for her having filed a complaint.
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, every one of
these cases is based on the assumption that the only
reason it was done is because of retaliation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.
MR. PHILLIPS: The lunch is in exactly the
same position.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would say that's
outside --
MR. PHILLIPS: So that can't be the standard.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that would be outside
4 if this is done deliberately in retaliation for
filing a complaint. Just switch her from a work
routine that she could easily manage and still take
care of her family and to one that is impossible for
her to manage.
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, if you adopt
the other approach, what you say is that every change
in assignments within the ordinary course of business
is subject to claim by a plaintiff --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not -- not --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- in any situation --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- not every --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- where he or she thinks
she's been retaliated against.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not everyone, but only the
ones that would, in fact, deter a reasonable person
from filing a charge. And that would not be every
trivial --
MR. PHILLIPS: And -- and again, the problem
with that legal standard, Justice Ginsburg, is it is
not the same one that applies under section 703, and it
seems to me there's no reason to provide greater
protections under 704 to plaintiffs than you would have
under section 703.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't you say that
Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical would be covered by the
Meritor standard, if in fact this woman couldn't --
couldn't really do the job with this -- with this new
time assignment? Why wouldn't it qualify as being
sufficiently severe or persuasive --
MR. PHILLIPS: Pervasive.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to alter the conditions
of the victim's employment and create an abusive work
environment?
MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, to be sure, that's a
possibility -- that's a possible answer.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- this is a
peculiar effect on one person, but for most people --
MR. PHILLIPS: But it could be severe enough.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- most people it wouldn't
matter. But --
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but the question is, is
it severe, I think, to that person? I think that is
the Meritor standard, is, is it severe to the
individual plaintiff?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're changing your
answer. You originally told me that, no, that that
wouldn't fit because it's the same job.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, that's because
that's the tangible employment aspect of it. Justice
Scalia says you're right about -- well, I don't know if
he said I'm right about the tangible -- tangible
employment aspect of it. But he says, you know, as you
recognize, there is a second category of claims, and
the second category of claims is the Meritor standard,
which I've been arguing for.
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't a change in the hours
that a person works a change in the terms and
conditions? You change your -- somebody's shift from
the day shift to the -- to the night shift, isn't that
a change under 703?
MR. PHILLIPS: It -- it probably depends on
whether or not it was the expectation of the -- of the
employee that -- that he or she would have a certain
set of hours, because an awful lot of employees take a
job with the expectation that they'll work any hours.
Now, you may get into a particular pattern and -- and
even set yourself up for that, but if -- if the
expectation is that you were going to work potentially
hours and you shift from one set to another, that I
don't think is a change in terms and conditions of
employment within the meaning of 703.
If I could just shift slightly to the
suspension, pending investigation, part of the case.
And there are two parts, and it's important to
recognize that if the Court sets aside either one of
those claims, then we're entitled to a new trial
because the damages flow directly from both and there
was no specific -- there was no special verdict in this
case to identify what -- where the damages come from.
And our argument with respect to the
suspension, pending investigation, is that there was
simply no final action taken by the employer in this
context until 15 days later. She was suspended for
insubordination by her supervisor. Under the
collective bargaining agreement, all she had to do was
send in a letter. If she didn't want to send in a
letter, the -- the decision would become final and
there would be final action that's clearly subject to a
claim under section 704.
She did send in a letter. There was an
informal investigation. The informal investigation
concluded that there was no basis for suspending her
for insubordination, and she was reinstated with
complete back pay.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So she was docked in her pay
for 2 weeks. I mean, for some people, this would be a
real hardship, no pay for 2 weeks. I mean, it's --
it's final as far as she's concerned, for those 2
weeks.
MR. PHILLIPS: Except that it was all -- it
was -- it was reinstated.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, they went back
later and -- and made up for their mistake. But -- but
the -- it seems to me the issue is whether a mistake
was made that -- that was final action that hurt her.
I don't see why -- it's certainly official action. I
mean, you can't say --
MR. PHILLIPS: There is official action.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it's not official just --
just because it was decreed by a -- you know, a track
boss or something. It -- it was an action of the
company because the company cut -- cut off her pay for
weeks. Right?
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but then the question
still remains, Justice Scalia, for it to be a tangible
employment action, is it -- is it available to the
employer to cure, when the purpose of this entire
statutory scheme is to avoid litigation and to provide
informal mechanisms for protecting the rights of the
employee.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it didn't --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but if the employer --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it didn't cure. I
mean, it was 37 days, right, that she went without pay?
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not just 2 weeks. And she
understandably experienced much stress in that time.
She worried about how she would be able to feed her
children, could she get them Christmas presents. That
was -- there was nothing that she got, when it was
determined that she hadn't been insubordinate, that
compensated her for that stress and, indeed, for the
medical expense that she incurred because she had that
stress.
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, there still
remains the core question of whether this is a tangible
employment action. It's not a long-term action. It's
not an economic effect, and the fact of -- of anxiety
-- that happens all the time in the work place. It's
not actionable.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But when -- when somebody
is suspended, it seems to me that is as tangible as it
can get. It gets registered officially. This person
is suspended, and if she doesn't do something about it,
she's out.
MR. PHILLIPS: But she did something about
it, and it was corrected, Your Honor.
I'd like to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- official action is --
is different from -- the problem with Ellerth was that
if there's nothing formally that had been done, the
employer -- this -- Ellerth was concerned with
vicarious liability, nothing official. There had been
none -- the boss wouldn't know about it. But somebody
who is suspended, that is an official -- that's a
tangible action.
MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure. And the question
is, can you cure it? And that's the fundamental issue
we ask you to decide.
Can I reserve the balance of my time?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Phillips.
Mr. Garre.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
Because title VII prohibits an employer from
suspending an employee for 37 days without pay because
of her sex or from reassigning her from one
responsibility that's material different -- materially
different than another responsibility because of her
sex, it prohibits an employer from doing so because she
filed an EEOC charge complaining about discrimination.
Title VII's anti-retaliation provision
creates an additional basis for unlawful
discrimination, but it does not create a different or
more expansive concept of discrimination in the
statute's core prohibitions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, in -- in the
absence of any suggestion that the collective
bargaining process is also infected with sex
discrimination, why can't we rely on that process to
give some basis to the job descriptions? In other
words, forklift operator was not a separate job from
rail yard employee, and if the union wanted to make
them separate jobs, they could negotiate that, but they
didn't. So why -- why do we regard that as a material
change when you're doing one part of a job as opposed
to another part of a job?
MR. GARRE: Well, I think the problem that
Justice Souter identified, I believe, where an employer
or even a collective bargaining agreement could
identify categories that had so many different
responsibilities --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the
difference there is that's an employer unilaterally.
We don't have that here. The employer is dealing with
the union. If the jobs really were that different, the
union would categorize them differently and negotiate
for that.
MR. GARRE: Here, what we know and what the
jury found -- and this is actually -- it's important to
keep in mind. This is a jury finding. The jury was
instructed properly on what would constitute a material
adverse employment action. The instruction is at page
and 64 of the joint appendix.
One of the conditions that a jury could find
an adverse action based on was a materially significant
change in responsibilities. The jury heard evidence on
the different types of responsibilities that the
Respondent performed, and it concluded that being
changed, being reassigned after 3 months of working the
forklift, to manually repairing railroad track was a
materially significant change in responsibilities.
That's the language that comes from this --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't your approach
require an employer to keep shuffling the employees
around so they don't get a sort of adverse possession
of particular types of job responsibilities?
MR. GARRE: I don't think so. I think it
would be ultimately a jury question in this particular
category of claims. As -- if -- if it were the case
that employees typically worked the forklift and then
the next day worked the -- worked the track, then the
next day did something else, then I don't think a jury
could find that there was a material -- materially
significant change in responsibilities.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No. That's his point. I
mean, that's his point, that -- that the one way to
avoid the problem is to keep shifting people around.
MR. GARRE: Well, that -- that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would have been
impossible here because there was no one in that entire
unit who could operate a forklift except this one
employee.
MR. GARRE: That's right. And -- and if --
if employees were shifted around for one reason or the
other, then I still think it would be unlikely to be a
material change in their responsibilities when they
went --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- is it -- was it
in this category, this track category? Because it was
something new for the employer. There hadn't been a
forklift operator. I gather there had only been one
before.
MR. GARRE: There was testimony to that
effect, Justice Ginsburg. Also, when -- when
Respondent was hired, they had just lost their existing
forklift operator, someone who had done that.
In any event, I don't think the evidence will
permit a court, if it agrees that material adverse
employment action is the test, to overturn the jury's
finding that the change here was materially adverse.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect to the
suspension, what -- what if she had been -- during the
process of investigation, she had been allowed to stay
on the job with pay? In other words, the facts are the
same. It's just that the -- the sort of stay process
works the other way and she's not relieved until the
end of the company's investigation. Is the initiation
of that an materially adverse employment action?
MR. GARRE: Well, I think most courts have
held that where you have suspension with pay, then you
don't have material adverse employment action. Now, at
some level, if the suspension is so long, 6 months, a
year, then effectively you could have a different type
of material adverse action, but where it's a 2-week
suspension to investigate, that would not be material
adverse action. In fact, as -- as the AFL-CIO amicus
brief points out, I think, that's the favored practice
in the industry.
Now, we -- we do think that with respect to
the standard, that as this Court recognized in
Faragher, it makes good sense to harmonize
discrimination standards. And here, we think that
Congress intended the courts to harmonize the standard
for section 704, the anti-retaliation provision, with
the standard for section 03, the act's core
prohibitions.
Justice Scalia, it does -- the section 704
does omit the phrase, terms, conditions of employment,
but as we've explained in our brief, we think it is
reasonable to read the discriminate against as a
shorthand for the unlawful employment practices
identified in section 703.
It's also important to keep in mind that
Congress knows how to write a broader anti-retaliation
statute when it wants to. Look at the ADA, the Family
Medical Leave Act. These are statutes which, by their
terms, prohibit employers from any attempt to
intimidate, coerce, threaten, or interfere with the
exercise of rights. Look at the Family Medical Leave
Act --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know if that hurts
you or helps you. I mean, that -- that eliminates what
seems to me is the strongest argument of the -- of your
side, which is that it makes no sense to impose greater
sanctions upon somebody who -- who files a complaint
than it does upon somebody who -- who violates
somebody's race, religion, or whatever by -- by
discriminating.
MR. GARRE: Well, we --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're telling me it does
make sense, that we've done it in other areas.
MR. GARRE: With respect, what I'm telling
you is that Congress has determined in that some areas
it may be important to have a broader provision
protecting against intimidation and coercion. I mean,
if the Court interprets discriminate against to include
all that kind of conduct, then it renders those
provisions redundant.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does your test cover the
person who's a former employee who complained under
title VII, wants a recommendation letter, and isn't
given one for retaliation -- as retaliation for having
complained under title VII?
MR. GARRE: It does, Justice Ginsburg. As
the Government explained in its brief in the Robinson
case, post-employment references are reasonably viewed
as a term, condition, or privilege of employment
because it's routine for employees to request them and
routine for employers to provide them.
Now, if I could address the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well --
MR. GARRE: -- the reasonably likely to deter
test that you referred to, Justice Breyer.
If the Court disagrees with our submission
that the statute should be written in pari materia,
then as we said in our brief, we think that that is the
next best test to adopt. But -- but the Court should
-- it should be clear to the Court how much broader
that test is than the material adverse action test.
JUSTICE BREYER: It's not -- it's not -- the
-- the words of the statute that I think are relevant
is it -- is it -- you can't discriminate with respect
to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges
of employment. Now, the words I just cited are present
in 703. So that's the substantive offense. Those
words, as Justice Scalia pointed out and others, are
missing in 704, and that suggests that you could have a
broader definition than those words I just cited as to
what counts as harm flowing from a discrimination.
That's the statutory argument.
And then you add, there could be good reason
for that. These people typically are at work and there
are lots of subtle forms of harm and some not so
subtle.
MR. GARRE: Well, again, we think Congress
knows how to write that statute, and it does it
differently. It has a different provision. For
example, in the Family Medical Leave Act, not only
included the coercion and intimidation language, it
also said in any manner discriminate.
We also think, again, going to our
interpretation of discriminate against, it makes sense
to read that for a -- as a shorthand for the -- the
unlawful practices spelled out and detailed in section
3.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'd be curious. In
the -- in the Seventh Circuit, they have a test, I
gather, like the D.C. Circuit, which you've
characterized as broader. Have there suddenly been a
flow of these claims towards the Seventh Circuit? Is
there any empirical data that this concern that has
been brought up is empirically present in the Seventh
Circuit?
MR. GARRE: Two -- two points with respect to
that.
First, no, I don't know of empirical data in
the Seventh Circuit.
Second, we know that retaliation charges are
-- are rising. They've more than doubled in the past
decade.
And third, the Seventh Circuit test is
essentially like the -- the test that this Court
applies in the First Amendment context to determine
when there's retaliation. This Court in the Rutan case
observed that something as trivial as failing to hold a
birthday party for an employee could satisfy that test.
Applying this test in the lower courts, courts have
held that an officer not being able to see his police
dog would be -- could go to a jury, that -- that a
shunning conduct less than hostile work environment
could go to a jury, that failing to hold employee
feedback meetings could go to a jury --
JUSTICE ALITO: But if 704 doesn't
incorporate 703 why would the -- the EEOC test be the
next best test? If Congress -- there's nothing in 704
--
that refers to the EEOC standard, is there?
MR. GARRE: That's -- that's true. I mean,
at that point, we think it would just be a policy
decision. Again, we think that Congress made the
policy decision that the tests should be harmonized.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Congress could have --
could have said -- could have thought not only do we
not want people who -- who file complaints not to
suffer those things that would deter a reasonable
person from filing a complaint, but we just don't want
them to suffer at all for having engaged in this
protected activity.
MR. GARRE: That's possible. That would be
JUSTICE ALITO: What -- what basis would
there be for deciding that Congress had one policy
objective as opposed to the other there?
MR. GARRE: We think that the balance that
Congress struck in title VII was from -- between
deterring all forms of discrimination and not -- not
allowing every employee grievance to become a Federal
court case. I think the Court has recognized
repeatedly not all work place conduct that's offensive
or even harassing violates title VII, and we think that
that same compromise should inform the Court's
interpretation of section 704 of the statute.
If there are no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Garre.
Mr. Donati.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD A. DONATI
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DONATI: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please
the Court:
When Burlington Northern reassigned Ms. White
from the forklift to the track and then removed her
without pay for 37 days during Christmas, it, quote,
discriminated against Ms. White under any reasonable
standard, the EEOC standard, the plain language
standard, or the standard that the unanimous en banc
court of the Sixth Circuit adopted. Whatever standard
the Court applies, Ms. White should prevail, if it's a
reasonable standard, other than that of the -- of the
Petitioner.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if she'd been
operating the forklift for only a week and then she was
reassigned? Would that still be discrimination under
any standard?
MR. DONATI: With respect to the motivation,
if there -- if there was a motivation, a retaliatory
motivation, according to the proper reading of 704, it
would be because what that aims at is motivation.
And the question was asked, and -- and a
legitimate question was asked. Why would Congress make
4(a) more expansive than 703? Well, if you look at
the text of 704(a) at the beginning of the caption, it
says, discriminate in assisting, participating, or
cooperating with enforcement.
This -- this provision, as the dissent said
in the Jackson case last term, in referring to
retaliation, the dissent made this -- made this point
about the relationship between retaliation and the
primary right. The dissent indicated that the primary
right is being protected by the retaliation provision,
that without the retaliation provision, the primary
right could be impeded, inhibited, and prevented from
individuals having access to the remedial mechanisms.
It doesn't take much to intimidate an
individual from filing a claim of discrimination if
they have an economic interest. It takes much, much
less to intimidate a witness to come and testify when
they have no basis.
What 704 was aimed at was allowing the law
enforcement agency here, the EEOC, to have access to
complaints about discrimination and witnesses, allowing
the courts to have access to complaints and witnesses
because without that free access and without 704 acting
as a guardian around the primary rights, the primary
rights would be eviscerated.
This is a perfect example of -- of a case
where that's the situation. You have a -- a woman here
who did exactly what this Court asked her to do in
Ellerth. She complained internally about sexual
harassment. She was hired because of her forklift
responsibilities. She was immediately put on the
forklift. She performed for 90 days competently as a
forklift operator. No complaints about what she did.
Because she complained about sexual harassment, the
jury found, and correctly, she was removed from the
forklift.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm a supervisor, and
the employee files a complaint against me as a
supervisor. Thereafter, I am not as friendly to that
employee as I used to be. I don't smile and say, good
morning, how are you, as I used to. All right?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you wouldn't expect me
to. This person has, you know, hauled me onto the
block. Now, am -- am I discriminating against that
person?
MR. DONATI: No, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not? I'm not treating
her the way I did before.
MR. DONATI: No. Until there is some use of
official authority that affects that individual, you're
not discriminating. That's a -- that's a personal
matter between you and the individual.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Sort of like taking her to
lunch.
MR. DONATI: If it's -- if it's a blue collar
worker and it's -- it's not part of their
responsibility and they sometimes eat together in the
lunchroom or not, that would not be. However, if it is
a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, you say it -- it has to
be part of my -- it doesn't have to relate to her terms
and conditions of employment, you say --
MR. DONATI: No --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because it's not the same
as 703. But somehow you say it -- it has to. Does it
have to or not have to?
MR. DONATI: There are situations where it
would be broader than 703. 704 would be broader. An
example. If a CEO of a company came up to an African
American male and punched him because he's Black, that
would not rise to the level of a hostile work
--
environment under your test. It wouldn't alter that
individual's terms and conditions of employment.
However, if the CEO came up to an individual
who had filed a charge of discrimination -- of
discrimination, and said, I don't like you filing
charges of discrimination, and pushed that individual,
that would have the effect of impeding individuals from
complaining. And that's -- that's a situation that's
different because Congress anticipated that -- that
retaliation is only as varied as the human imagination.
Congress could have easily --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I worry about that, as
-- as varied as the human imagination. Juries can have
wonderful imaginations. I mean, that -- that is the
problem. Is it meant to be this -- this uncontrolled,
this uncabined?
MR. DONATI: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is your
criterion that is going to stop every little thing from
-- from being deemed a retaliatory measure, such as not
saying good morning to this employee?
MR. DONATI: There are several things that
are built into the statute. First is 701(b). It has
to be an act of the employer, and those trivial matters
--
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand that. But
almost any act of his subordinates will be deemed act
of the -- of the employer where retaliation is
concerned, I'll bet you.
What else besides that?
MR. DONATI: Plus, you always have to show
causation, and many, many cases are dismissed on the
basis of summary judgment, even termination cases on
the basis of causation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll give you causation.
But I'm talking about the triviality -- the
triviality of the action in question. Is there no test
that eliminates a trivial action from the aggrieved
employee who -- who wants to litigate?
MR. DONATI: Your Honor, both the EEOC test,
as well as our test, is one based upon a reasonable
person under all of the circumstances. And -- and the
trial courts frequently say under this set of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: A reasonable person would
what -- would what?
MR. DONATI: Under our standard, it would be
JUSTICE SCALIA: A reasonable person would
consider it to be?
MR. DONATI: Adverse.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Adverse.
MR. DONATI: If it was -- if it was
unfavorable to the plaintiff. On the EEOC standard, it
would be if it deterred an individual from filing a
charge.
And, Justice Scalia, we have cited favorably
the EEOC standard. What we were asked to do here --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is the EEOC standard any
more based in the text of the statute than -- than the
standard proposed by your adversary here?
MR. DONATI: That's why we proposed one
that's based with what the statute means. And -- and
the statute is very clear. The plain language is
unambiguous. That's our first test, which is
unfavorable to the employee based upon an objective
standard.
But if the Court felt it necessary to -- to
back to a position that was not quite so expansive, the
EEOC standard is -- is the one that's most rational
because it's based in the purpose of 704(a).
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You won on the basis of
the standard that the Sixth Circuit used, which was not
your standard and not the EEOC standard. Why should
this Court deal with anything other than that the
petitioner's standard is unsatisfactory, that at least
the Sixth Circuit standard -- why should the Court deal
with the universe of cases when it has this case before
it, two actions, and a unanimous Sixth Circuit judgment
that says these two actions fall within 704?
MR. DONATI: Justice Ginsburg, you're exactly
correct. You don't have to reach the issue about how
expansive 704 is here. You can affirm the Sixth
Circuit's decision based upon the material adverse
employment action standard that they articulated, that
was litigated below, that the defendant did not object
to, and which we won on.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you said
earlier that the act -- one of the protections against
trivial charges was that the act had to be the act of
the employer. If the employer sets up a review system
in which the final act of the employer is the decision,
why is a preliminary charge, initial suspension, review
-- why are those also considered acts of the employer?
MR. DONATI: Mr. Chief Justice, I want to
answer one question related to that. The collective
bargaining agreement did not cover the forklift.
That's in the trial transcript on page 524. It was a
new position. It was not covered by the collective
bargaining. So they --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does that mean,
it was not covered by the collective bargaining
agreement? Presumably you paid -- the person who did
that was paid wages pursuant to the collective
bargaining agreement.
MR. DONATI: It was not a defined job within
the collective bargaining agreement.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
MR. DONATI: And if you look at the -- the
job title, which is part of the joint appendix, forklift
is not mentioned, and it was not part of that.
But to answer your question specifically with
respect to these facts, the -- in this case here, she
was discharged. If you look at the joint appendix, on
rule 91(b) -- and that's found at page 54 and 55 of --
I'm sorry. 55 of the joint appendix. This is the rule
under which she requested the, quote, investigation.
By its very terms, it doesn't even apply until an
employee is, quote, disciplined or, quote, dismissed.
She was dismissed when she was removed from service.
Then she asked for a hearing under subpart (b), and she
was given an investigation.
This Court, in its jurisprudence dealing with
statute of limitations, said in the Morgan case that an
act of discrimination occurs when it happens. Well,
when she was happened -- when this happened, she lost
pay, she lost benefits. She was terminated. Even --
even their own witness, Roadmaster Brown, testified had
she not asked for an appeal, she was terminated. So it
was a discrete act at that time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your position is that
it would be an -- it would be a covered employment
action even if none of that were true, she didn't lose
pay, she didn't lose benefits, so long as there was the
initiation of the disciplinary action. You regard that
as sufficiently adverse under 704.
MR. DONATI: Well, under these facts, it was
sufficiently adverse because she lost pay. Now, in a
-- in a theoretical sense, if she had not lost pay,
that still could be adverse under 704(a). It depends
upon the effect and the motive. I don't think that
anyone would quarrel under 703 if an African American
was suspended without pay because of race, that that
would be actionable. Why would it not be actionable in
this context?
There's a difference between damages and
whether or not there's actionability under this one
little part of -- of the claim. Perhaps if she was --
was suspended for a retaliatory motive and 5 days later
she was returned, she may have no damages, and -- and
the claim might -- but in terms of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Other than
eligibility for punitive damages.
MR. DONATI: Well, assuming that you could
get through the hurdles. And I don't think punitive
damages would necessarily sound there. In the Kolstad
case, the Court indicated one factor to consider would
be how quickly the -- the defendant corrected the
situation. I mean, if you have a -- if there's a
legitimate process that's -- that's available and a
supervisor who has authority to suspend does that for a
retaliatory motive and -- and that process corrects it,
it may be a factor in punitives, but it's not a factor
whether a -- an act has been taken because the act is a
discrete act. It caused her to lose compensation and
-- and to lose benefits. So it could affect the
punitive damages.
Now, with respect to the -- the statutory
construction -- well, let me address the -- the
forklift issue just a -- a little bit further.
If you take the position that the -- the
petitioner has here, Ms. White -- it's a jury finding.
Their witnesses testified -- went from the most easy
or one of the most easy positions to the most difficult
position because she complained about sexual
harassment. That's the finding of fact. They don't
dispute the findings of fact. That's the finding of
fact. So if -- if he's correct, tomorrow, if his --
his position is affirmed, they could tell everyone who
complains about sexual harassment, that if you do that,
we're going to transfer you to the most difficult
position in the company.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose I
disagree with you as to the standard, that is, I think
4 and 703 both require something related to the
employment. Would -- what would the outcome be? Would
-- would the case have to go back to be submitted to
the jury under that standard? What standard did the
jury find --
MR. DONATI: Your Honor, if -- if you look at
-- if you look at the joint appendix at page 63, the
trial judge actually instructed the court -- instructed
the jury, listing six factors. Those six factors are
listed in a footnote in Ellerth, which you cite
favorably as what the standard is -- or what the
standard is for vicarious liability. So the court --
the jury was instructed on material adverse employment
action standard. It was tried on the material adverse
employment action standard.
I argued that the forklift position was
materially adverse. The defendant, if you look at the
--
transcript of the closing at pages 48 and 49, didn't
even challenge that it was adverse. Everybody that
heard the proof, common sense told you that when you
went from a forklift running things around to pulling
out railroad ties, it was adverse. So to answer your
question, Justice Scalia, we traveled all the way up to
this Court on the material adverse employment action
standard, and we won.
JUSTICE ALITO: What does -- what does
material mean?
MR. DONATI: That's a great question, and we
(Laughter.)
MR. DONATI: -- and we -- we truly struggled
with that. We found nothing in the statute, the text
of the statute to say material. Where it uses adverse,
at -- at section 703(a)(2), it uses the term adverse,
but it doesn't use it with the term material. And --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do -- do you think it
does anything more than just eliminate clearly de
minimis action?
MR. DONATI: I'm sorry. I didn't --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do -- do you think the --
the materially modifier here does anything other than
eliminate obviously de minimis behavior on the part of
the employer?
MR. DONATI: I don't think it does anything
other than that.
It could also be interpreted as -- as this
Court said in the -- in the Wrigley case involving
interpretation of statutes, that there's a de minimis
rule. It could -- it could also be applied that way,
that every -- every statute -- there's a -- that --
that construction applies some de minimis level view.
But in terms of this case, this was
definitely material. I mean, it was substantial
injury, substantial action to -- to Ms. White.
But with respect to the forklift, their
witnesses testified -- and we cite at pages 2 and 3 of
the brief -- that they considered it easier. The
supervisor, Mr. Brown, testified that the men
considered it easier. And it clearly was.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what if she
operated the forklift usually 3 out of 5 days, and the
other 2 days was pulling up the rail ties and -- and
the shift was now she does -- operates the forklift 2
out of 5 days and 3 out of 5 days she's pulling up rail
ties? Is that materially adverse?
MR. DONATI: That probably would not -- I
probably could not convince a jury that that was
materially adverse. But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that isn't the test, I
mean, whether you can convince a jury.
I think you -- you have to acknowledge that
-- that before we -- we say that these trial
instructions were adequate to -- to give you your
victory, we -- we have to find that at least a
reasonable jury could conclude under section 703 that
-- that both of these -- both of these adverse actions
qualified as discrimination under 703, if -- if we're
going to use that test. Right? You acknowledge that.
MR. DONATI: I acknowledge and the facts --
and the Sixth Circuit unanimously affirmed that -- that
the facts were there. And I could -- I could go on for
minutes about the facts, and they're -- they're
contained in the first --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but that -- that is at
least what -- what's before us here, that if -- if we
go the 703 equals 704 route, we would have to conclude,
in order to affirm here, that a reasonable jury could
find. This jury did, but we'd have to find that that's
reasonable. Right?
MR. DONATI: Yes.
You know, I would like to address two things
that have been mixed. Apples and oranges have been
mixed here about tangible employment action, and that's
the standard this Court has adopted.
What the Court did in Ellerth was apply the
rules of vicarious liability in a discrete set of -- of
cases, harassment cases. Harassment cases arise out of
the word condition. As you indicated, sexual
harassment has to alter the condition, and it has to be
severe or pervasive. And what the -- the petitioner is
-- is saying is that because of your application of
tangible employment action to vicarious liability, that
you really defined what constitutes discrimination.
Well, that's not what the -- the ruling was.
You were strictly limited to whether instances of
vicarious liability, when -- when employers will be
found liable. At the outset, that needs to be, I
think, clarified that it was not a finding of what
constitutes discrimination.
And with respect to also the Ellerth
situation, any test that this Court adopts should not
be a per se test where some things are per se legal,
because when you say that an act of retaliation is per
se legal, it provides safe harbor for people to do
things to individuals. Most employers are --
JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right in thinking -- I
just want to clarify this -- that in the circuit court,
--
they applied a pretty tough standard, namely, a
standard that sounds a lot like Ellerth, the Kocsis, or
whatever it is? Tangible employment actions, a
significant change in employment status, hiring,
firing, failing to promote, reassignment with
significantly different responsibilities, or a decision
causing a significant change in benefits. And that's
basically what the jury was instructed.
MR. DONATI: That's --
JUSTICE BREYER: And you won under the
toughest standard.
MR. DONATI: That's correct, a very tough
standard.
JUSTICE BREYER: So in a sense, you have
nowhere to go but up.
(Laughter.)
MR. DONATI: Exactly right. And I find --
and I find myself, Justice Breyer, here sort of arguing
against the standard that I won under.
JUSTICE BREYER: You don't care what standard
MR. DONATI: And I don't care what standard
it is.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- for this case.
MR. DONATI: I don't care what the standard
--
is for this case.
But if you adopt a -- a standard that is --
is broad -- or you have to adopt a national standard or
-- and you don't have to here. You don't have to make
these -- make these findings.
But if you do and you adopt a material
adverse employment action standard, there always needs
to be a provision that prevents per se rules because --
and in the Sixth Circuit, they talk about unique
circumstances. Some other circuits talk about unusual
or exceptional circumstances because if you -- if you
black letter something, that this is legal retaliation,
employers who want to will engage in that process.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and the other argument
is that if you don't do it, there's no way to -- to get
a case dismissed before it goes to a jury. You're
saying every claim is going to be a jury trial. I
mean, that -- you know, come on.
MR. DONATI: Justice Scalia, every claim
would not be a jury trial because you're going to have
to show the causation issues and damages issues. And
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the triviality issue
would be out of the case. No matter how trivial, it
goes to a jury. That's -- that's what you want us to
say.
MR. DONATI: No, Your Honor, that's not what
I want --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then we have to have
some per se rules.
MR. DONATI: Well, the -- the rule that you
could apply that would not have per se rules and would
ferret out any kind of -- of trivial matters would be
the EEOC standard with a de minimis rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Don't you want us to
exclude this ultimate employment decision? I think
that's one thing. In order to win, you have to say
what counts is the suspension and not the ultimate
decision.
MR. DONATI: Yes, Your Honor. Under the
ultimate employment action standard of the Fifth
Circuit, the -- the suspension would be in question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So for you to win to
preserve your Sixth Circuit victory, that would have to
be ruled out.
MR. DONATI: The Court should find that
that's not applicable and it's not appropriate under
title VII and -- and that would be necessary for us to
prevail, even though the defendant did not argue
ultimate employment action standard at the trial level,
didn't ask for such an instruction, didn't raise that
issue until subsequent to the -- this. But you're
correct. We would need the Court to say that that does
not apply.
And then one other issue about -- about
bright line rules. I advise and many lawyers advise
women every day that complain about sexual harassment.
And Mr. Phillips is absolutely correct. There has
been a rise in retaliation claims. And, of course,
it's complex what the reasons are, but anecdotally I
can tell you a lot of it sits at the foot of Ellerth
because employers establish policies, they publish
the policies, they educated women and men about those
policies. People use those policies, and women who
complain about sexual harassment, such as Ms. White,
internally and then are retaliated against, when they
go to the EEOC, they file a retaliation claim. And
there's been an increase of those claims.
But if this Court applies a black line rule,
a per se rule, where you say something is legal, that
you can do what you did to Ms. White, then I'll have to
advise individuals to go to the EEOC. There might be
some retaliation and it's legal. And a woman placed in
a situation like that will not complain about sexual
harassment. And the protection, the guardian that rule
-- that 704(a) has around the primary right will be
eliminated, and the primary right will be adversely
affected because women will no longer complain. So
whatever rule you apply, don't apply a black letter,
per se rule because you're going to cause serious harm
to the underlying primary rights.
If there are no more questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. DONATI: Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Let me begin by focusing on the jury
instruction in this case. The jury was not instructed
with the Ellerth standard. There's a variant of the
Ellerth standard, and it was not upheld by the court of
appeals on the Ellerth standard.
What the court of appeals said was in the
Sixth Circuit there is a unique circumstances standard
that arises out of its particular way of analyzing
these issues, and under that standard, it could be
upheld. And that was the same basis on which the
district court at Pet. App. 118a upheld this particular
verdict.
So the question of the right standard to be
applied and whether a reasonable jury could find it
under these circumstances, Justice Scalia, is clearly
presented in this case, and it's an issue that this
Court still has to decide.
Second, with respect to the suspension, the
-- the collective bargaining agreement specifically
provides for discipline and then 15 days. It's not a
final decision. There's nothing in that collective
bargaining agreement that says it's a decision of the
employer. To the contrary, the decision at the end of
the -- of the investigation is the decision of the
carrier. And we don't need a final employer action
standard in order to prevail on this. What we need is
the opportunity to cure and a reasonable way under --
under section 704, as the D.C. Circuit held
specifically in Taylor.
And then finally, with respect to the
observation about, you know, don't make any per se
rules, well, the truth is there aren't going to be any
per se rules. There will be a lot of cases that get
dismissed out under a tangible employment action theory
because there aren't tangible employment actions. But
there will always be available the severe and -- and
pervasive standard, which is always going to constrain
any employer from -- from adopting those kinds of
policies.
And the point that counsel made is that he
recommends to every one of his employees -- he probably
should recommend two things. One, you show up. You
ought to file a complaint about discrimination in the
work place because under his approach, you will,
therefore, be super-protected under section 704 in a
way you wouldn't have been by merely being protected
under 703. That cannot possibly be what Congress
intended or what is helpful for the work place. The
Court should reject that approach, should reject the
Sixth Circuit's view, and remand.
Thank you, Your Honors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Phillips.
The case is submitted.
