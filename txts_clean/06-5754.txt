CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in case 06-5754, Rita versus United
States.
Mr. Cochran.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS N. COCHRAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. COCHRAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Under the system described in
Justice Breyer's opinion for the Court in Booker, judges
would no longer be tied to the sentencing range
indicated in the guidelines. That, of course, was a
passage from this Court's recent decision in Cunningham
versus California. Mr. Rita is asking the Court in this
case to reiterate in strong enforceable terms that it
meant what it said in Booker, that the guidelines are
merely advisory provisions. The Government's assertion
that the guidelines deserve a presumption of
reasonableness was nothing more than an unfounded claim
put forth to justify its efforts to try and thwart the
Booker decision.
The ink wasn't given a chance to dry on the
Booker decision before the Department of Justice issued
a memo to all of its Federal prosecutors directing that
they adhere to the guidelines and that they seek
sentences within the guidelines in all but extraordinary
cases.
The district court below in this case did
not treat the guidelines as advisory when it imposed a
-month within guideline sentence. The district court
did not consider Mr. Rita's military record, the fact
that he had been a combat soldier in two wars.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can you say that,
given that at the sentencing hearing, that military
record was brought out, his physical ailments were
brought out, his activity in law enforcement, all that
was brought out? And indeed, the judge was assisting
the defense attorney to make the case clearer when it
was presented.
MR. COCHRAN: In the district court,
Mr. Rita did put forward evidence of his military
records, health concerns, he -- the district court
received that information. The district court did not
consider that information because there's nothing in the
record where the district judge weighed any of that
information to determine what -- what effect to give any
of it.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you know, you don't
get a summary judgment case all the time. I used to get
them, and the district court would hear all the
arguments and write down the word denied. Does that
mean he didn't consider the arguments? That's a very
common thing. Here we have a district judge, he hears
all the arguments. The attorneys brought it out. It's
in the file. He reads the presentence report. It's all
there, and the judge says, on balance, I'm going to go
apply the guidelines. So how can you say he didn't
consider them?
MR. COCHRAN: Justice Breyer, the district
judge didn't say that we're going to weigh all of the
stuff, and I --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, he doesn't in a summary
judgment case either. I mean, I've had quite a few of
them, I used to, I think, where they just wrote denied.
That was the opinion.
MR. COCHRAN: Well, in the instance of a
summary judgment matter, we don't have 3553(c), that
requires the district court to state in open court in
front of the defendant the reasons for the imposition of
sentence.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, he says the reasons
are these. I think that the guidelines sentence is a
reasonable sentence. Would that be sufficient?
MR. COCHRAN: It would not, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? What in the
statute or the law or the Constitution says that a
district judge, although it might be good form in a
difficult case to write more, but I've often written
opinions where I say, and the remaining arguments we
feel are not sufficient to change the result. That
means I don't think they're that great an argument, and
I don't answer every single one.
MR. COCHRAN: With regard to the first
question Your Honor posed, it's not sufficient for the
district court to simply state conclusions, which is
what happened in this case, that --
JUSTICE BREYER: Where in the law does it
say that?
MR. COCHRAN: Well, in 3553(c), it requires
that the judge give the reasons for the imposition of
the particular sentence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where -- I'm looking at
that. It says shall consider. Am I missing something?
MR. COCHRAN: The preamble states --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me your page
cite?
MR. COCHRAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor, on page
-A of Petitioner's brief in the appendix. It states,
"the court at the time of sentencing shall state in open
court the reasons for its imposition of the particular
sentence." And that's what we contend requires the
district court to explain the facts that the court is
relying on to impose the particular sentence in the
case.
JUSTICE BREYER: So it isn't sufficient, in
your view, that the judge just says, the reason I
imposed this sentence is that's the guideline sentence,
and I think in this circumstance it's reasonable?
MR. COCHRAN: That's correct, Your Honor.
Because the guidelines don't take into account all the
myriad facts, and in this case, did not take into
account the military record, the employment record,
Mr. Rita's health concerns. The guidelines specifically
did not take those into account.
JUSTICE BREYER: I think these other factors
that have been brought out, while they're serious
factors, I don't think they're enough to warrant a
different sentence. Suppose he adds those words?
MR. COCHRAN: Your Honor, I think the --
JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm worried about
basically is, I don't think in the law there's a special
category that requires a judge to give special reasons
in a guideline case. I think it's the same as any other
matter. Judges do normally give reasons. And I'd worry
a bit about creating a special situation where district
judges have to do something unusual.
MR. COCHRAN: I don't think that this is
unusual, Your Honor. I think the court has to explain
the rationale for imposing the sentence, and not only
does it have to do so in court, in front of the
defendant, so the defendant understands the sentence
that he is receiving --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I get where you're
going. Can I say this in an opinion, would this satisfy
you? And of course, like any other matter, judges do
normally give reasons. They do normally reject
arguments with reasons, and it's the same here. Would
that satisfy you?
MR. COCHRAN: I think it would have to be
specific to the issues raised by the parties. And in
this case, at a minimum, the judge would have to address
the three issues that Mr. Rita put forward and discuss
those: His military record, his employment, his health
concerns. It would have to address any issues that the
Government would raise, and any issues that the district
judge was considering that maybe neither party had
raised to the court as well.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you reconcile the
language in the prologue of (c) which says, the court
shall state the reasons, with (c)(2), which says that if
the sentence is not of the kind or is outside the range
described in (a)(4) of the guidelines, the court shall
state the specific reason for the imposition of a
sentence different from the guidelines?
Now, this seems to set up some dichotomy
between giving reasons and giving the specific reason.
Where does that line fall in your estimation?
MR. COCHRAN: Well, I think foremost, Your
Honor, is that that provision came about prior to the
Booker decision when the guidelines were mandatory. And
what that addresses and what it was meant to address was
if the court were to depart, then it was -- it needed to
explain that departure in a greater reason to enable the
sentencing commission to take that information into
account in revising the guidelines.
That is still a purpose with the sentencing
commission, to revise the guidelines, and they can still
use that information. But it -- at the very least, we
need information from the sentencing judge about each of
the matters that he or she --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't answered my
question. I mean, you explain why it's put in there,
but I want to know what is the difference between giving
the reasons and giving the specific reason.
MR. COCHRAN: The specific reason I think,
Your Honor, is so that the sentencing commission can
take that information into account in later revisions of
the guidelines. That was the purpose at the point that
statute was passed.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But are you saying now that
that distinction should be ignored?
MR. COCHRAN: I don't know, Your Honor, if
it's so much that it should be ignored inasmuch as the
district court needs to give as many reasons, or as
clear a reason for the imposition of the particular
sentence. That will help --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But it sounds to me as
though you want all the reasons to be specific. I mean,
I understand your argument. But if we accept that
argument, then the distinction between reason and
specific reason basically is going to be a matter of
history, and perhaps it should be.
MR. COCHRAN: It, it may, Your Honor. And,
and because that provision predated this Court's Booker
decision, it still holds relevance but not nearly the
relevance it had when the guidelines were mandatory.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your position would
be, Mr. Cochran, that the obligation to be even-handed
--
would have to -- that the trial judge would also have to
go through -- now this defendant maintained his
innocence. He didn't express any remorse. He accused a
Government agent of perjury. All that, he would have to
take into account, just as specifically?
MR. COCHRAN: Your Honor, I think that the
Court certainly could consider all of that; and -- and
if pressed by the Government would need to consider
that. But certainly at a minimum, the Court needs to
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that what the
Government pressed at the sentencing hearing?
MR. COCHRAN: It did, Your Honor, and again
the district court never came out with any specifics
regarding any of those issues other than the conclusion
that it felt that the guideline range was not
inappropriate.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the district court
says I give these following -- I've considered these
following specific factors. But in my view, the
consistency and nationwide uniformity that the
guidelines strive to achieve is of great importance; and
for that reason, I'm following the guidelines?
MR. COCHRAN: I don't --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that an inappropriate
judgment for the district court to make?
MR. COCHRAN: I think it's inappropriate,
Your Honor, because while there should be uniformity in
an attempt to move in that direction, uniformity is not
the end all and be all. 3553(a) addresses
individualized sentencing of the defendant before the
court.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not the end all.
Suppose the district judge said I think this is of great
importance. You don't think that the Booker opinion --
or do you think the Booker opinion rejected uniformity
and consistency as an important factor?
MR. COCHRAN: I don't believe the Booker
decision rejected that, Your Honor. What I believe the
Booker opinion said was that for there to be advisory
guidelines, for there to be constitutional sentencing
practices, then uniformity is going to have to give way
to some extent. At least at the very beginning.
Once the district courts apply the 3553(a)
factors, and go through the statute, and consider the
guidelines, the district courts will then explain their
rationale; and then that rationale will be -- in our
opinion, will show where the shortcomings of the
guidelines are.
JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Cochran, are you arguing
the sentencing in this case violated the Sixth
Amendment?
MR. COCHRAN: Not as it was applied. It
came close in the sense that the district court was
laboring, in our opinion, under the belief that the
guidelines held some control.
JUSTICE ALITO: If it didn't violate the
Sixth Amendment, then your argument is based on the
Sentencing Reform Act?
MR. COCHRAN: Well, it came -- it may have
violated the Sixth Amendment. I don't know that I would
concede that. But to avoid any constitutional issue, if
we analyzed this under the statute, clearly the district
court didn't comply with the statute.
JUSTICE ALITO: You can't say whether it did
or did not violate the Sixth Amendment?
MR. COCHRAN: The district court held the
guidelines to a greater quantum than simply advisory.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, was your client's
sentence enhanced by any fact that should have been
submitted to the jury?
MR. COCHRAN: Well, under -- under a pure
advisory system -- and I think Your Honor is addressing
the cross-reference in this matter -- in a purely
advisory system, the guidelines were calculated
correctly in Mr. Rita's case, because under a purely
advisory system, the district court could look at that
cross-reference, understand that it came about from
uncharged and unproven conduct, and disregard it.
But by not doing so in this case, and that
cross enhancement doubled his effective guideline range,
then this case may very well be unconstitutional because
of the extra weight that the court gave the guidelines.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Cochran, you do
contend, do you not, that if the guidelines had been
mandatory, there would have been a violation of the
Sixth Amendment.
MR. COCHRAN: No question, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Because of the, the
accessory after the fact point.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's right, Your Honor,
absolutely.
JUSTICE BREYER: Then the question
ultimately is, does it violate the Sixth Amendment to
say that we have a presumption there, a sentence is in
the guidelines as a reasonable -- if you're an appellate
court judge. And you think it does violate the Sixth
Amendment?
MR. COCHRAN: Our position is that the
presumption does violate the Sixth --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then I guess the argument
of the other side, which I would like you to address, is
that, in which there -- we didn't think it violated the
of Sixth Amendment if the district judge simple applied
53 -- uh, 3553(a). And of course, 3553(a) includes
all of these things that go into the guidelines; it make
a big point of that in 3553(a).
So why -- why couldn't you say, you know,
all these factors are taken into account by the
commission? They start with an effort to a apply them
in typical cases. This is their judgment in typical
cases. So it is entitled to some kind of weight; and --
at least in a typical case.
MR. COCHRAN: Your Honor, the guidelines
should be consulted. No question --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, not consulting
them. What I'm trying to do is to how much weight can a
judge reading this give them without violating the Sixth
Amendment? All I'm trying to do here is not whether the
guidelines are good, bad, or indifferent. Congress
wanted to apply them. We excised the mandatory to
comply with the Sixth Amendment. Now, what else do we
have to do to comply with the Sixth Amendment? Because
I would think unless we have to do something else, we
shouldn't do it, because Congress wanted it.
MR. COCHRAN: I would contend, Your Honor,
that the Court needs to very clearly explain that the
guidelines are, are a reference. They are --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The guidelines are what?
MR. COCHRAN: Are a reference.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you say it is an
initial benchmark?
MR. COCHRAN: I don't -- when we start
establishing benchmarks and presumptions, I think that's
where we, we --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So benchmarks are bad.
Presumption is bad. Great weight, that's bad?
MR. COCHRAN: That's bad, too. And I think
it's just another thing to consider.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it matter what
judge did in other cases? I mean, if we look on the day
before he said, well, the guidelines say this, but I
think this case is different, so I'm going to depart,
and the day after he says I know what the guidelines
are, but I'm going to impose a higher sentence?
I mean, how do we know he's -- when he says
I looked at the guidelines and I think they're
appropriate, that he's considering himself bound by
something that he may or may not agree with, as opposed
to what he said? Which is, well, I cannot find that
they're inappropriate?
MR. COCHRAN: And what that tells me,
Mr. Chief Justice, is that, that the district court felt
that the guidelines had a center of gravity, that the
judge was bound -- in other words, shifted the burden to
the defendant to say, well, I -- unless you can show
that these are inappropriate, that it is a setting of a
benchmark, it's a drawing of a line, and we contend that
that is what the Sixth Amendment prohibits.
If the guidelines are advisory, if they are
but one of many factors to be considered, together with
all of the other factors in 3553(a), the court can use
that information, can use that reference. But once it
starts putting any greater weight on the guidelines --
and the statute doesn't admit to that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the point that
Justice Breyer made that these other factors have been
taken into account by the sentencing commission because
Congress told them to consider those same factors?
MR. COCHRAN: Well, Your Honor, the
sentencing commission by its own admission has not taken
into account all of the factors. In the very first
guideline manual, 1987, the sentencing commission itself
said it could not take into account all of the facts
that play into human conduct.
JUSTICE BREYER: There are two separate
things there. The general aims of sentencing, the four
basic aims of sentencing, I believe the commission
certainly took into account. A separate thing was the
rule that said you can depart only for a matter that has
not been fully considered by the guidelines.
And there the original version, I believe,
said that we've considered nothing thoroughly. Except
for certain specific matters that had been mentioned
like age, race, and we'll refer to statutorily. Now,
that is what you're thinking of? I mean, if that's what
you're thinking of, I don't think it's relevant to what
your present point is.
MR. COCHRAN: I'm not, Your Honor. First of
all, I don't know and would contend that the initial
sentencing commission did not take into account all of
the four purposes of sentencing. They centered on crime
control --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's because when they
looked at all of the literature, they explained it, the
rehabilitative purpose was not that it wasn't taken into
account, it was there was a consensus among experts that
there isn't much you can do about it. That's different
from not taking into account.
MR. COCHRAN: The other point I think with
regard to that, Your Honor, is in looking at 3553(a)
that statute gives the district court the dual commands
of first considering all of those factors and then
imposing a sentence sufficient but not greater than
necessary. The statute does not give to the sentencing
commission that obligation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Cochran, I have this
concern: If we accept your submission that the district
court should just consider the guidelines together with
everything else, give them a presumption of validity,
anything else, just something to consider, that would
presumably eliminate any Sixth Amendment problem with
the district court's findings of fact.
But the district court's sentence is going
to go on appeal. And the appellate court in reviewing
it for reasonableness, let's assume in this case the
appellate -- the appellate court says oh, no, this
person had -- we find as a matter of fact, given the
record, military service, you know, which we think
should have been taken into account. And, therefore, we
set it aside.
Now, the next case that comes up, which
doesn't have the element of military service, in all
other respects the same as your client's case, it comes
up to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals
would say, ah, we don't have that different fact here
and therefore we affirm the sentence.
Isn't -- in other words isn't the finding of
a fact necessary for the process of judicial review,
even if it is not made necessary for the purposes of the
district court's determination? He would not get that
sentence but for this fact.
MR. COCHRAN: That's correct, Your Honor.
And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you haven't shown us a
way out of the problem.
MR. COCHRAN: In a purely advisory system,
the district court is bound by the statutory minimum and
maximum. And as this Court has said in Cunningham, if
the Court is bound simply by that statutory minimum and
maximum, then the factual finding as to where within
that is up to the district court.
It's only when we establish thresholds as
the guidelines do we run into the constitutional
problem.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, even if you don't --
don't establish thresholds by reason of the guideline,
you are establishing thresholds upon judicial review,
guidelines or not.
If the -- if the appellate court says, oh,
given there's this fact in this case, the sentence below
was reasonable, but in the next case, where that fact
does not exist, the court of appeals says, ah, the
sentence is unreasonable, in other words, that fact is
made a necessary condition for giving the higher
sentence.
So you haven't -- you haven't solved the
problem of the, of the apparent conflict between --
between Booker and the advisory guidelines.
MR. COCHRAN: Well, I think so long as the
district court can evaluate and consider and potentially
reject what the guidelines say, just as the Court can
consider the effect of -- of the person's military
record, Mr. Rita was a combat veteran in two wars, which
is separate and apart from someone who may have been an
Army recruiter --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not focusing on my
point. I concede that the district court is free as a
bird -- free as a bird -- but you have appellate review.
And the appellate court in reviewing for reasonableness
is going to make a particular fact determinative of
whether this sentence can stand or not. Isn't that
right?
MR. COCHRAN: It is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's going to be a
problem.
MR. COCHRAN: I think what the court would
have -- the appellate court would have to do is evaluate
all of that through the prism of 3553(a). Is the
sentence that was imposed the least sufficient sanction
that the court below could have imposed. And if not,
for whatever reasons, vacate it and return it back to
the district court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if
there weren't guidelines at all, and the district court
said maybe, you know, it's new, I want to see what other
judges have done; he presses a button on the computer,
give me what the sentences were looking at these facts,
and finds out in the last 100 cases, this is what the
sentence was. And he says this seems to me no different
than those and that's the sentence I'm going to impose.
Is there any problem with that?
MR. COCHRAN: There is. And again, because
53(a) is an individual weighing of the defendant --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, well, he looks
at all the individual factors and he says they seem not
terribly different from these 100 other cases and the
range in those 100 other cases was, you know, 5 to 7
years, and so I'm going to give him 5 years.
MR. COCHRAN: If the district court
considers all those facts and considers what may have
been done and it is sufficient, if not greater than
necessary given those facts, then the court can do that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that
different than the -- how is that different than looking
at the guidelines, which did that in a much more
comprehensive way, and saying, I don't see anything
different in this case from the normal guidelines case
and so I'm going to impose that sentence?
MR. COCHRAN: Well, the guidelines didn't
take everything into account, and the sentencing courts
were coming from 18 years of mandatory guidelines, of
being required to follow this book that necessarily
didn't incorporate all of the human factors in
sentencing. And they have held to that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it did incorporate
them in that district judges were free to depart from
the guidelines if indeed they found there was some one
of these human factors not considered by the guidelines
which existed in the particular case.
MR. COCHRAN: In theory, yes,
Justice Scalia. But in practice, no, because what
happened in the very cases as United States versus Foy
out of the Ninth Circuit, the defendant in that case
argued to the district court that he should have a
departure based upon lack of mutual guidance, and it was
a reasoned decision.  It went to the Ninth Circuit. The
Ninth Circuit found it to be a reasoned decision; and
within the next amendment process of the Sentencing
Commission, it was eliminated as a departure basis with
no discussion at all.
So yes, there may have been departures, but
they were systematically removed, and in fact chapters
(h) and 5(a) show that very clearly.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if they were
systematically removed then all of these other human
factors that you're complaining about were considered by
the guideline commission and were simply rejected.
MR. COCHRAN: They weren't considered, Your
Honor, and in the history of those amendments that's
borne out.
And if the Court has no further questions,
I'd like to reserve some time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Dreeben.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The court of appeals appropriately applied a
presumption of reasonableness in reviewing the sentence
imposed pursuant to the advisory guidelines system that
this Court announced in United States versus Booker.
The guidelines represent the integration of the multiple
purposes of sentencing reflected in section 3553(a) that
the district court is obligated to consider. The
commission also represents an expert body that has
considered the various parameters of sentencing and the
fact patterns that arise in the Federal system and has
made an effort over time to arrive at an appropriate --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true, just to get
one thought out on the table, that there are factors
that the guidelines don't -- did not consider, such as
military service?
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, the
commission considered that factor and then determined
that it was not generally appropriate to a sentence
outside the guidelines.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it true that
under the guideline no weight is given to military
service?
MR. DREEBEN: The guidelines specifically do
not give weight to it. They permit a judge --
JUSTICE STEVENS: What should a judge do if
he thought some weight should be given to military
service?
MR. DREEBEN: Under Booker the judge should
do that. That is the difference between an advisory
guidelines system and a mandatory guidelines system.
The judge can give weight to factors That the commission
decided should not have weight in the sentencing
process. That is the essence of what it means for the
guidelines --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And presumably cannot give
weight to factors that the commission decided should
have weight.
MR. DREEBEN: He can do that, too,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE BREYER: Are we back to the original
version, which I'll read what it says. It says: "With
a few specific exceptions -- race, sex, national origin,
creed, religion, socioeconomic State -- with those
exceptions, the commission does not intend to limit the
kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else
in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for
departure in an unusual case." That's what it said. A
part of the guidelines in the heartland. If it's not
the heartland, depart.
Now, what I wonder is are we not back under
your theory of it just to where we were when it started
out, before the commission started ruling all these
things out and began to make all its -- the judge could
do that.
MR. DREEBEN: I think we're back,
Justice Breyer, to a further point even than the first
set of guidelines, because even under the first set of
guidelines application of the guidelines was mandatory
unless the court found an aggravating or mitigating
circumstance that wasn't taken into account.
JUSTICE BREYER: We said we took nothing
into account and therefore any circumstance that makes
the case unusual would be in principle a ground for an
exception.
MR. DREEBEN: I understand that,
Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying more than
that is necessary.
MR. DREEBEN: I think that the
reconciliation of this Court's merits opinion in Booker
and its remedial opinion in Booker does dictate that the
judge has additional freedom to impose a sentence that's
different from what's described in the guidelines.
JUSTICE BREYER: He could do this: He could
set aside the guideline on the theory that the guideline
itself is unreasonable, that is it doesn't properly take
account of sentencing. But suppose he doesn't do that.
Then, if you take your view that there's a presumption
in its favor and if it is the normal case, not an
unusual case in any respect, how can he not apply the
guideline?
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I think we
have to distinguish between what the job of the district
court is and what the job of the appellate court is; and
in this case, the Government is arguing for a
presumption of reasonableness on appeal. Once the
district judge has determined that the guidelines
sentence aligns with his own application of the section
53(a) factors, our submission here is that a court of
appeals can generally presume that that is a reasonable
sentence. The defendant of course has the opportunity,
or the Government if the Government has appealed, to
show that that presumption is overcome.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But unless there is a way
to calibrate the strength of the presumption, there's no
clear way to distinguish the presumption from the
mandate. The mandate is gone. You say yes, they
consider other things. But unless we can calibrate the
presumption in some way that says, you know, a mandate
was force 60 and a presumption is a force 40, something
like that, there's no way to tell the two apart in
practice.
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, I'm not sure
that that would be true even if what we were talking
about was a direction to the district judge to presume
that he would impose a guidelines sentence. But that's
not what we're talking about. The district judge does
not operate and does not have to operate under the
position that we're arguing for with a presumption that
the judge will impose a guidelines sentence unless
persuaded otherwise. The judge's obligation is to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: He doesn't have to do it
unless he wants to be sure of being affirmed.
MR. DREEBEN: I would think that what the
judge wants to do is be sure that he's complied with his
statutory obligations.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, perhaps I
misunderstood Justice Souter's question, but I have this
concern, and I thought it was his concern as well. At
the appellate level, is the presumption something that
can only be overcome by a clear and convincing showing
or is it just an initial benchmark? We're playing with
standards and words here.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, we are.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And when we talk about
presumptions at the appellate level, that's actually a
little strange in any event. You usually talk about
presumptions as assisting us in finding a fact.
MR. DREEBEN: That's true, Justice Kennedy.
But I think what it reflects at the appellate level is
that the court of appeals enters the case with an
attitude that, our job is to decide whether what the
district judge did was reasonable. We can operate --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we write that this is
an additive thing?
MR. DREEBEN: Yes, I think that it's not so
different from the court of appeals saying we can enter
this case feeling pretty confident that we can affirm a
guidelines sentence unless the person who challenges
that shows us a good reason otherwise.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is your view -- on
your view, is the appellate court engaging in some kind
of de novo review or is the appellate court supposed to
engage in a review that it will disturb the sentence
only if it is shown to be unreasonable?
MR. DREEBEN: The latter, Justice Souter.
And I think that in that regard there is a range of
reasonable sentences that could be imposed based on a
given set of facts.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you -- if
you have that, two criminals, criminal defendants, with
the same identical background and everything else, one
judge says, I think military service should be taken
into account, so I'm going to depart from the guidelines
by 3 years. The judge next door says, I don't think it
should be taken into account so I'm going to impose the
guideline sentence. Both cases are appealed. They're
consolidated for argument. What is the court of appeals
supposed to do? Uphold both of them?
MR. DREEBEN: The court of appeals can
uphold both of them if it concludes that the actual
sentence that's imposed is reasonable. And in the
second case that the Court is going to hear today the
Government argues for a proportionality principle that
should govern the review of sentencing.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What is reasonable is -- is
not merely a sort of number within a spectrum. It seems
to me that what is reasonable is a function in part of
the reasons that are given. And in the Chief Justice's
view, two diametrically opposed reasons are given for
two different sentences. Does the, does the appellate
court in his example say, well, I think reasonable
people could go either way on that, so however it comes
out it's fine on appellate review? Isn't that what the
court would have to do in order to affirm both
sentences, other things being equal?
MR. DWYER: You're right, Justice Souter,
and I can't say that that would be the first choice of
the Congress that enacted the Sentencing Reform Act.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it clear that it
would have been the last choice of the Congress?
MR. DREEBEN: It is, and it's not the first
choice of the Government, either. But it strikes me
that it is something of an inevitability once this Court
has declared that mandatory guidelines are impermissible
under the Constitution if judicial factfinding --
JUSTICE ALITO: What does the Sixth
Amendment have to do with the selection of the
sentencing philosophy that is to be imposed? How can
there be a Sixth Amendment violation if either the
guidelines or our case law says military service is or
is not a relevant factor? I don't see how that has
anything to do with anything that you can get out of the
Sixth Amendment.
MR. DREEBEN: It probably does not,
Justice Alito. But what happened in the first part of
Booker is that the Court declared that the guidelines
are advisory and advice. It's advice that can be
accepted or rejected.
JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but Booker says
what we're trying to do is to come close to what
Congress wanted but not violate the Sixth Amendment.
Now, what I think we're talking about now --
I think -- i mean, you sort of shed some -- you
clarified something very well for me, which is that in
this case we're talking about the situation where the
district judge applies the guidelines sentence, and then
what's the attitude of the court on appeal, and the
attitude is going to be, well, the Sentencing Commission
thinks it's okay, the judge thinks it's okay, okay, you
have to -- you better show me a good reason to think to
the contrary. Fine.
But the interesting problem is the problem
of the next case which you're now talking about, is,
well, what happens if the district judge and when should
be the district judge and how free should the district
judge feel he is to depart from the guidelines sentence
even if it's not an unusual case.
MR. DREEBEN: Let me try to address that and
try to address Justice Alito's point about the question
of how much sentencing philosophy can be decreed by the
sentencing commission or Congress before a Sixth
Amendment problem arises.
As I understand this Court's sequence of
opinions from Apprendi leading up to the most recent
decision in Cunningham, if the law establishes a level
of punishment that may be imposed based on the facts
found by the jury and says to the judge, judge, you may
not go above it unless you find a particular fact, that
fact is subject to the Sixth Amendment rule that the
Court has announced and must be found by a jury.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Or some fact, not
necessarily a particular fact.
MR. DREEBEN: Any fact at all, as a matter
of fact is what the Court has said, although I
understand that to mean facts pertaining to the offense
and the offender, not facts about the world such as the
prevalence of crime.
Now, what that leads me to conclude is that
in order to escape the bright line rule that's been
announced in this sequence of cases, including Booker
itself and most recently Cunningham, a judge must be
able to look at the set of facts that the jury found,
determine what level of punishment would be advised by,
say, a guidelines system, and not be bound to impose
that level of punishment if the judge feels that a
different level of punishment is appropriate.
If that is a correct understanding of what
this Court has held, it necessarily implies that a judge
does have a certain amount of freedom in an advisory
guidelines system to disagree with what the Sentencing
Commission has found, give the judge's reasons, and then
is subject to appellate review for the reasonableness of
that explanation and, the Government submits, subject to
a proportionality principle, so that the sentence that's
imposed outside the guidelines is a reasonable one and
not an arbitrary one.
Now, if I'm wrong about that and it is not
necessary for the court to have the legal freedom to be
able to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission
said, that would be very good from the Government's
perspective. But as I understand the complementary
rules that are established by Booker, what an advisory
guidelines system requires is that the guidelines be
treated as advice rather than mandate. So while the
guidelines have determined that military service is not
ordinarily relevant to the level of punishment, a judge
may determine in a particular case that he disagrees.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, this is the
hypothetical: Supposing a judge thinks military service
is relevant, and he decides to impose a sentence a
little below the guidelines. But then he says, I
recognize that in this circuit there is a strong
interest in uniformity and the court of appeals has
adopted a rule where they will presume a within
guidelines sentence is reasonable and will affirm in
those cases. And I think with respect to the court of
appeals, I think I would be wise to impose the
guidelines sentence, so I will do so even though my own
judgment is that it should be slightly lower. What
should the court of appeals do with such a sentence?
MR. DREEBEN: I think the court of appeals
should correct the judge on a mistaken apprehension of
law, which is that the judge --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Should reverse the judge
then, within a -- a within guidelines sentence?
MR. DREEBEN: In the circumstance,
Justice Stevens, I think that you put your finger on two
different types of review. In the circumstance in which
a district judge operates with what I'll call legal
blinders on that prevent him from complying with --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No. He operates with
total candor. He's saying exactly what he feels like
saying.
MR. DREEBEN: I'm hoping that it's a
misunderstanding of what the court of appeals has said,
because the court of appeals should not have told the
judge you're obligated to impose a guideline sentence.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they didn't say
you're obligated, but you can be pretty sure you'll be
affirmed if you do impose within guidelines sentences.
MR. DREEBEN: Judges are still obligated to
comply with 3553(a), which requires them to exercise
discretion. Now if a judge decides I might as a
personal matter if I were writing the guidelines write
them differently, and I might give great weight to
military service, but one of the things that I'm
required to do under section 3553(a) is to consider the
need to avoid unwarranted disparity between defendants
who have been convicted of similar criminal conduct and
have similar records. And therefore, I am going to
moderate my own personal preference and not impose a
significant outside the range sentence, in order to
ensure that I fully have taken into account the fact
that we are in a Federal system with 674 Federal
district judges, and we cannot have all our own personal
guidelines systems.
Now if a judge does that, I don't think
there's anything wrong with that. I think that judge
has actually complied with --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the court of
appeals does that? What if the court of appeals says
we've got 10 district judges in this circuit, nine of
them do not take military service into account, one
does, and we think that's inequitable, doesn't serve the
interest in uniformity. And so even though that one
judge says in the exercise of my discretion I'm going to
depart, we're going to reverse that as unreasonable?
MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, I think
there's a difference between a sentence that varies from
what other judges would do and a sentence that is
unreasonable.
If the sentence that is different from what
other judges would do is not supported by a cogent and
coherent explanation, and it is unduly productive of
disparity because, say, it takes a guidelines range like
this one, of 33 months to 41 months, and the judge says
in my view military service means that this defendant
gets probation.
Or to take an example that's on the other
side, suppose that the judge says this defendant
actually didn't get any extra credit in his criminal
history for his prior crime, but he has been convicted
before of lying to the Government about his gun charges.
I'm now going to take him up to the statutory maximum or
near it and give him eight years. I think in those
circumstances a court of appeals can and should say,
hold on, this is a view that the district judge is
entitled to take on the merits. He's entitled to give
greater weight to that factor, whether it's aggravating
or mitigating, than what the guidelines did, but not to
this extent, or we're going to be left with a system in
which disuniformity is the main principle.
JUSTICE BREYER: It's not that complicated.
All that happens is the court of appeals says, look, in
the case of bank robberies we've discovered about 33
percent of the defendants in the typical case have been
in the Army. And therefore, we think that just ordinary
armed services is not a reason, ordinary armed --
services in the military is not a reason for a
diminished sentence. That's all, period. Or they can
say it the other way, the absence of a military service
is a reason for having the higher sentence, put it any
way you want. And by the way, district judge, if you
disagree with that, we're going to reverse you because
we think it's unreasonable. Okay. What about that?
MR. DREEBEN: That to me sounds identical to
the system that pre-existed Booker's holding.
JUSTICE BREYER: It did. But is there
anything in the Sixth Amendment that forbids that?
MR. DREEBEN: This Court hasn't specifically
addressed --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what do you think?
Because I would think that if you're going to answer
that question yes, you are saying that not even the
court of appeals can try to assure a degree of fairness
among different defendants in respect to sentencing.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, I would
like to be able to answer the question yes and say that
courts of appeals can establish their own sub-legal
rules as --
JUSTICE BREYER: It's not sub-legal rules.
What it's called is precedent. What you do is you
decide a case and you decide this is unfair, and then
the thing that as a similar case comes along, is you
decide it the same way. And if a district judge doesn't
follow that, you reverse it.
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, if do you
that, what you have is each court of appeals functioning
as a sentencing commission.
JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. You've simply
substituted stare decisis and the necessity of the
district court following circuit law for the guidelines.
And --
MR. DREEBEN: Exactly.
JUSTICE BREYER: If the guidelines are
unconstitutional because they make facts automatically
determinative, I assume that would be unconstitutional
because it makes facts automatically determinative.
MR. DREEBEN: I assume too under the
rationale --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well then, in other words,
the Constitution of the United States prevents the
courts themselves from trying to assure that sentences
who are -- that individuals who are in similar
positions, commit similar crimes, will be treated in
similar ways. That to me is possible, but of course
I've been in dissent in these cases. But it seems to
me --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So long as the jury
determines the facts that make them similar.
JUSTICE BREYER: We're back --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The problem here is what
makes them similar.
MR. DREEBEN: I understand this dialogue.
And what we have --
(Laughter.)
I too have been with the dissenters in these
cases, and what I'm trying to argue for here is a set of
principles that appellate courts can apply and that
district courts can look to when sentencing, that will
come as close as is reasonably possible to achieving
Congress's aims in the Sentencing Reform Act without
crossing over the bright line rule that this Court has
announced --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know how
terribly different it is than the normal review for
abuse of discretion. I mean, you don't even need two
judges in my earlier question. Let's say you have the
same judge, and for three weeks every criminal defendant
who comes before him he says, I think if you have
military service, you should get a reduction. And then
all of a sudden he says, I see you have military
service, but I'm not going to give you a reduction. I
mean, is he bound by some abuse of discretion standard
to be a little bit consistent? And if that's the only
type of appellate review we're talking about, to ensure
some degree of consistency in how similar individuals
are treated in similar cases, I don't see that it raises
any concern.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm
not arguing for any proposition that I think would raise
concern. I do think that a general tenet of abuse of
discretion review is that the court of appeals can
affirm a result that it would not necessarily have
reached itself.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, may I ask
you, please, to address a point that Mr. Cochran raised?
I think you were very helpful in saying this presumption
for the guidelines is how the court of appeals evaluates
a district court sentence, that there is no presumption
that binds the district judge.
But one of the main points that Mr. Cochran
made in his presentation was the district judge has to
give reasons. He -- this was just a summary paragraph
at the end of the sentence hearing. He has to respond
to what defendant presented. He has to respond to what
the Government presented. There is an obligation
stemming from subpart (c) to give reasons, and that's
what he saw as the principal flaw in this sentence, that
the court of appeals has used. Reasons weren't given
for it.
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, I don't
think there was anything problematic with what this
district judge did. As Your Honor noted, this was a
sentence that was imposed after a lengthy sentencing
hearing in which the court engaged in a dialogue with
defense counsel about the three bases and the exclusive
bases on which defense counsel asked for a downward
departure. The judge at least four times in this
transcript brought up Section 3553, recognizing that the
judge was well aware of his obligation to imply the
purposes of sentencing and the factors that were
presented to him. Now he did that and he made comments
along the way that indicate why he did not find physical
condition, military service, or asserted vulnerability
in prison to be reasons that would justify giving this
defendant a lower sentence.
And in his ultimate explanation, though it
is brief, he pointed to two of the Section 3553 factors
explicitly. He pointed to the seriousness of the
offense and he pointed to the need for public
protection.
Now if you look at the legal obligations
that the judge had under Section 3553(c) to explain
himself, the statute actually sets up a hierarchy of
three different levels of explanation. First, in any
case the judge is to state the reasons for the sentence.
Second, if the sentencing range is greater than 24
months, the judge is supposed to explain the particular
reason for giving a sentence at one end or another end
of the range. And finally, if the sentence is outside
the range, the judge is to give the specific reason for
a sentence outside the range. That statutory framework
makes it entirely plausible to say that if a judge
imposes a guideline sentence and explains, I see no
reason not to impose a guideline sentence, he has met
his burden of explanation without having to respond
literally and in sequence to each argument that the
defendant has made.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?
The district judge is reviewed under an abuse of
discretion standard, which I take it means there's a
presumption he got it right. Is that correct? There's
a presumption the district judge sentence is correct?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens, our
position is more complicated than that, because within a
guidelines range if a sentence is imposed, the
Government --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why shouldn't there be
also the same presumption when it is outside the
guidelines range?
MR. DREEBEN: Because sentences that are
outside the guidelines range are more likely to be the
cause of or a source of unwarranted disparity than a
sentence within the range. And that is why that if the
court of appeals is interested in fulfilling what Booker
said the role of the court of appeals is, which is to
iron out sentencing differences, there is more
reason for the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, do you think the
interest in uniformity, in same sentences across the
board is stronger than the interest in getting the
correct sentence for the particular defendant who's in
court at the time?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, there isn't any one
correct sentence usually.
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, there isn't. But if
you say the district judge has broad discretion, which
he does, and the review is under abuse of discretion,
why should there not always be a presumption that the
district judge got it right?
MR. DREEBEN: Because there are more legal
elements that go into sentencing and sentencing review
than just those that you've named, Justice Stevens.
Section 3553(a) itself, which is the guidepost for
review, mandates that the district court consider the
guidelines, consider the policy --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it's sort of like
findings of fact. They must take into consideration all
sorts of aspects of the case, and you have a strong
presumption that the findings of fact are accurate. Why
don't you have a strong presumption that the ultimate
judgment on the sentence is also accurate?
MR. DREEBEN: What happens when a sentence
is imposed outside the range is that there is a greater
risk of infringing the main purpose of the Sentencing
Reform Act, which was to avoid unwarranted disparities;
and in contrast to a sentence within the range which
does not merely run that risk to the same degree, a
sentence outside the range may well. It's different
from what the sentencing commission with its expertise
and its experience has recommended as the appropriate
sentence, given those facts.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're -- I mean,
this is a self fulfilling prophecy. You're saying if
you don't comply with the guidelines, you're not going
to have uniformity. Well, I -- my goodness. Is that
consistent with the notion that the guidelines are
advisory?
MR. DREEBEN: I wouldn't put it as strongly
as that, Justice Scalia. What I would say is that the
further that a sentence diverges from the guidelines
range, the greater the possibility of unwarranted
disparity; and as a result of that, a court of appeals
should look more critically at the reasons that the
district court gave and ensure that the constellation of
reasons and facts that's presented is not so likely to
be a disproportionate sentence than --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's just
inconsistent with the notion which I think is correct,
that the district judge can simply disagree with the
basic -- basic reasons of the commission, can simply
disagree with the fact that the commission considers
white collar crime, for example, something that should
justify incarceration.
MR. DREEBEN: But Justice Scalia,
reasonableness review connotes that the court of appeals
will review the reasons that the district court gave for
that disagreement.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So doesn't your presumption
argument come down to an argument for a sufficiently
comprehensive statement of reasons, with a more
extensive statement required the further the court gets
from the guidelines? Isn't that what it boils down to?
MR. DREEBEN: It does for an out of range
sentence, Justice Souter. I think that for a sentence
within the range, the judge's statement that I have
considered the guidelines range and I think it's
appropriate does explain why that judge has given the
sentence that he's given. It's consistent with the
statute and it's consistent with the Constitution. Now
when --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there -- may I interrupt
you? Because your time is getting short.
Is there a difference between a presumption
of reasonableness to the guidelines on the one hand and
a rule that says the further you get from them, you can
get as far as you want to, but the further you get from
them, the more extensive your explanation has to be?
Is there a distinction between those two,
two rules?
MR. DREEBEN: There is a distinction between
them but I think they are complementary rules and in the
next case the Government will argue for a presumption
that is precisely what you have articulated,
Justice Souter. A greater and more extensive and more
persuasive explanation is needed the further that you go
from the guidelines range.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or presumably the
further the facts suggest that you ought to depart from
the guidelines range? If you've got a submission here
compelling reasons, you shouldn't follow the
guidelines, and you get one sentence from the district
court saying -- you know -- I followed the guidelines,
presumably that would be the same as a significant
departure without further justification?
MR. DREEBEN: It wouldn't be identical but I
agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that a sentence
within the guidelines can be unreasonable if there is a
compelling case for a sentence outside the range because
the guidelines simply don't fit in that circumstance.
The sentencing commission itself recognized
that the guidelines were generalizations; they carved
out a heartland in the language of the sentencing
commission's first set of guidelines, and that there
will be circumstances that would justify different
sentences.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the system that you're
describing any different for mandatory guidelines that
are subject to departure when the district judge finds a
significant reason, which was what mandatory guidelines
had?
MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia. It is
quite --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wherein is it different?
MR. DREEBEN: It is different precisely on
the area that, that you yourself articulated. The judge
can disagree with the sentencing guidelines and
determine that on the basis of the facts that the jury
found, the judge would impose a different sentence, and
that conclusion is then subject for reasonableness
review and we submit based on a proportionality
principle.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Dreeben.
Mr. Cochran, you have three minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS N. COCHRAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. COCHRAN: That you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I would like to return first to the across
the board reasonableness review that this Court
established in Booker. That in and of itself shows why
there cannot be a presumption of reasonableness on
appeal. Because you are holding the presumption to a
different standard at that point. It is not a
reasonableness across the board. You are putting the
burden on one the parties, most likely the defendant, to
come forward and explain why the presumption should be
rebutted.
That flies in the face with the across the
board reasonableness this Court set forth in Booker.
The guidelines are fraught with disparity.
That why is they are advisory. That's why they can only
be advisory. And the district courts must be allowed to
look at them, to see them, to consider them, but
ultimately to impose a sentence outside them for valid
reasons.
In Mr. Rita's case, the court didn't.
court felt the guidelines held some undue weight.
indicated in the record in two places, first and
It is
foremost on page 49 of the joint appendix, where the
court at the beginning of the sentencing hearing states:
Other than the motion for downward departure that you
submitted, do you have any other objections; and what
I'm trying to do now is determine where your client fits
within the sentencing guidelines.
Clearly the judge was rooted in the
guidelines and that's why he gave a sentence of 33
months at the low end.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The, the judge also
pointed out that the jury made certain findings and he
thought he was bound by them; that is, the defendant
protested his independence, and the jury had found him
guilty of false statements.
MR. COCHRAN: That's correct. That's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The judge was bound by
those.
MR. COCHRAN: That's correct, Your Honor,
but interestingly the court found very dubious the
additional information regarding the cross-reference.
And on page 87 of the joint appendix, the court states
it was not able to evaluate the seriousness of that
other investigation; and yet that was the
cross-reference that doubled his guidelines sentence.
We would ask the Court to rule in this case
that the presumption of reasonableness cannot be
accorded to the guidelines.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Cochran, you've
started out by saying there were two places in the
record that you thought showed the judge was bound by
the guidelines. 49, what was the other one?
MR. COCHRAN: Your Honor, the other one was
page 87.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of the one -- oh,
that point? Okay.
MR. COCHRAN: And that would be in the
second paragraph, Mr. Chief Justice, where the court
found it was unable to stray or found the guidelines
were inappropriate; and I suggest that that is a, a
giving of greater weight and too much so in this case.
Your Honor, Mr. Rita asks the Court to find
that a presumption cannot be accorded to the guidelines,
that his sentence was unreasonable in this case, and
that his case be returned for resentencing. Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Cochran. The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:18 a.m., the above-titled
