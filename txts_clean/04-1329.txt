CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Inc.
Mr. Pincus.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
In its opinion in Jefferson Parish, the Court
stated that the key characteristic of illegal tying is
the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying
product to force the purchase of the tied product. The
Court held that the per se rule against tying applies
only if the plaintiff proves that the seller has -- and
I'm quoting from that opinion. The quote is on page 12
of our brief -- the special ability, usually called
market power, to force the purchaser to do something
that he would not do in a competitive market.
If the Court were confronted today for the
first time with the question whether the presence of a
patent on some aspect of the tying product by itself
demonstrates the existence of this forcing power, it's
inconceivable that the Court would adopt that rule.
Not only is there no empirical evidence to support it,
there's no logical basis for such a presumption.
The focus of patent rights is very different
from antitrust market analysis. Patent rights are tied
to a particular invention. Market power is buyer-
centric. A buyer may be able to choose from a number
of different products, some patented, some not, to
satisfy his or her need. The existence of a patent on
one of those devices does not preclude at all the
existence of alternatives that are equally attractive,
maybe even more attractive, to the customer.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Let me ask you about
patents and tying products. Are there component parts
that are patented in today's complicated world, and do
they -- do they -- do the component parts become part
of the tying product? I mean, how does that work?
MR. PINCUS: Absolutely, Your Honor. One of
the -- one of the evils of the presumption is that
there's nothing that says that the patent has to be on
the entire product. The -- the patent could be on a
component of a product. And in today's world, as Your
Honor says, television sets, CD devices, cell phones,
all of those devices are loaded with components, one of
which may happen to be patented. It may not be the one
that makes the -- it may not have to do with anything
that makes that product attractive in the marketplace,
but the presence of that patent would be relied upon to
make the presumption applicable.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, does the patent
somehow spread to cover the larger product? I -- I
don't see how it works.
MR. PINCUS: Well, I think -- I think the
theory of the application of the presumption is, first
of all, obviously, if the whole product is patented,
then the presumption would be applicable. But I think
there also is an argument that even if some component
is -- is patented, that component, because it's in that
product, gives that product market power because the
theory would go the patent would exclude the ability of
other competitors in the market to use that component.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose -- I
suppose we could say -- I just hadn't thought of it. I
-- I suppose we -- we could say that it's not a
separate product. I mean, no -- no -- there's no
market for the -- for the small micro-component in the
TV. You're selling a TV.
MR. PINCUS: But then I think the argument --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's an -- a very
interesting question, but it seems to me that we could
handle that by just saying, well, there's not a
separate product.
MR. PINCUS: Well, you could, but I think the
question -- the question would be whether that product
as a whole in the marketplace, which is -- part of it
is made up by this component. The argument would be,
if I'm a competitor, I can't duplicate that product
because that component is patented, and therefore, that
product that contains the patented component should get
the benefit of this market power presumption.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not a --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why would the person
want if he thought that? I mean, why would a person
want a patent if, in fact, he didn't think that it gave
him the power to raise price above what the price would
be in its absence?
MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, at the -- at
the time that -- that the inventions are patented, it's
not clear -- many inventors don't know what the market
value of their product will be.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, you see, you're talking
about the wide -- you -- you say there are a lot of
failed patents. The person got it because he thought
it would, but he shouldn't have because it actually
made no difference.
MR. PINCUS: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: There might be. I don't
know.
MR. PINCUS: Our system encourages -- there
-- it -- it certainly is possible there are many
patents that -- that are -- there are many inventions
that are patented that don't have value in the
marketplace. There are some that do. The problem with
this --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there might be.
There's a set of valueless patents.
MR. PINCUS: Yes, but the fact --
JUSTICE BREYER: And in respect to there
being a valueless patent, the owner would not be able
to raise the price over what it otherwise would be.
And why not then make that a defense, that a person
could say, I have a valueless patent, and he could
introduce evidence to prove it?
MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I -- I think
there are -- there are two answers to that question.
First of all, there's no empirical showing and -- and
no logical evidence that there -- the set of valuable
patents is larger than the set of valueless ones. And,
in fact, it's probably the evidence is to the contrary,
that the set of valueless patents is quite
considerable. So by creating a presumption and
shifting the burden based on something that's
demonstrably not true doesn't have a logical basis.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand the
respondent's position, it's not the component. They're
not arguing that. So you're answering a hypothetical
case that isn't presented here.
And also, respondent says that we are talking
only about patents where there is a successful tie. So
leave out all those cases where I have a patent and
it's never produced a penny, and somehow I can make
mileage out of that.
MR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor. I -- I think
respondent has moved away from -- from the Loew's
assertion that the mere existence of a patent shows
uniqueness sufficient to -- to satisfy the market power
test. And -- and one of the next level presumptions
that they propose is that if the -- if the patent ties
successful in the marketplace that shows market power.
But that's inconsistent with this Court's recognition
in -- in a number of cases that ties can be successful
in the marketplace not because they're backed by market
power, but because they are attractive to consumers in
a competitive market.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's go to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, you -- you had a
second point you were going -- in response to Justice
Breyer's question. What was your second point?
MR. PINCUS: Well, my second point, in
response to Justice Breyer, if I can recall it, was
that in the component situation, which was one of the
situations that we were talking about, that the problem
with the component test, the presumptions are supposed
to be easy to apply. And if you say, well, the entire
device has to be patented, then the next case is going
to be a case where 85 percent of the key ingredients
are patented, 15 percent aren't, and the question will
be, does the presumption apply? So you're -- you're
setting up a presumption which is designed to -- for
ease of application that will become extremely
difficult to apply.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't the refutation of the
presumption really the same thing as a demonstration of
market power?
MR. PINCUS: Yes. The -- the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and we usually leave
the demonstration of market power to the -- to the
plaintiff in the case.
MR. PINCUS: Absolutely, Your Honor, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So it -- it'd be rather
strange to -- to have in this one category of cases the
market power has to be -- or lack of market power has
to be demonstrated by the defendant.
MR. PINCUS: It would be extremely strange
especially because there's the lack --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think there's a
distinction -- do you think there's a distinction
between components in cases where there's a one-on-one
relationship between the tied product and the tying
product and cases like this which involve metering? Do
you think there's a different possible approach between
the two?
MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, we don't because
the -- the economic literature --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But your earlier point was
we know that a whole lot of patents are not all that
important. But is it not fair to assume that when a
patent can generate metering in this particular kind of
situation, that it -- that it's a likelihood that it
has more power than the average patent?
MR. PINCUS: No. I -- I think, A, it's not
reasonable to assume that, Your Honor, and it's
certainly not reasonable to assume it has the level of
market power that Jefferson Parish required, which was
significant market power. The Court there held that a
percent share of the relevant market was not enough.
So we're talking, in the tying context, of a very
considerable market power test.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But if it's -- if it is
true, as your opponent says -- and I don't know if it
is or not -- that you're able to get twice the price
for the ink than you otherwise would get, does that --
is that any evidence of market power?
MR. PINCUS: Well, first of all, that -- that
is not -- not true. The record reflects that the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if it were what the
record reflected.
MR. PINCUS: Well, if it were what the record
reflected and there was a relevant market that was --
that was restricted to this ink, yes. But we don't
think that the existence of a patent, even in the
requirements context, fulfills that test for the reason
that the economic literature is quite clear that price
discrimination, which is what their theory -- their --
their theory is metering should be sufficient to give
rise to a presumption because price discrimination
supposedly signals market power. But as we discuss in
our reply brief, there is a tremendous amount of
economic literature that says that is in fact not true,
that price discrimination occurs in very competitive
markets from airlines to restaurants to coupons.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it also true that
some -- some economists disagree? And I'm just
wondering if there's disagreement among economists,
should we take one view over the other?
MR. PINCUS: Well, I think the problem, Your
Honor, is that the presumption does take one view over
another based on -- based on something that was adopted
at the time there was no analysis. The presumption
says we're going to presume market power, and as
Justice Scalia said, we're going to put the entire
burden of refuting market power, in this one context,
separate from all of antitrust analysis, on the
defendant. And we're only going to do it in tying.
We're not going to do it in exclusive -- vertical
exclusive dealing arrangements where the product is a
tie. In that situation, which theoretically should be
exactly the same, there's never been a assumption that
there should be a market power presumption when the
product that's the subject of the exclusive dealing
arrangement is patented. Territorial arrangements.
There's never been an assertion that that's true.
This -- this is a relic really of the fact
that when the Court decided these patent tying cases,
there was a hostility to the expansion of -- of
intellectual property rights beyond the scope of the
patent. That first was reflected in patent misuse
doctrine, and then it was carried over to antitrust
doctrine without any analysis about whether the
assertion that the patent was unique, and therefore
there were anticompetitive effects, had anything to do
with the level of anticompetitive effect that the
Court required to show an illegal tie.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Pincus, let me go -- ask
you to follow up on that and, in effect, go back to --
to Justice Ginsburg's question. I will assume that
patents as such do not give market power. I will
assume that there are many successful ties in which
that is also not true.
What is -- is your kind of short answer to
the -- to the argument, which I think Justice Ginsburg
was getting to, that if it is, in fact, worth
litigating in an antitrust case, that is a pretty good
-- darned good reason to assume that there is market
power and that it is, of course, having a
discriminatory price effect? What's the short answer
to that?
MR. PINCUS: I think the short answer to
that, Your Honor, is that there are a lot of antitrust
cases that are filed that aren't successful, and
there's no reason to believe that just because a
plaintiff files a case, that it is going to be
successful. And, in fact, establishing a rule that the
filing of the case meets an element is -- is a bit of
an attractive nuisance.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I was going to say I --
MR. PINCUS: It's going to attract claims --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I would have thought the
answer was you could say that in any case in which an
antitrust case is -- is brought. So essentially it --
it gets to be reductionist.
MR. PINCUS: Well, and I think it's an
attractive nuisance. If that's the rule, if I can
satisfy the rule by filing a lawsuit, I'm certainly
encouraged to file a lawsuit regardless of whether
there's underlying really market power or not because I
-- no one will ever -- I won't have to worry about it.
The burden will be shifted to my opponent.
JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, the fact --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think the
existence of the laws of -- of -- the existence of the
lawsuit -- of -- of the presumption is what drives a
lawsuit?
MR. PINCUS: Yes, exactly, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, does it drive the -- I
mean, it -- it drives the lawsuit with respect to one
element. And -- and I -- I guess one argument is if --
if we reaffirm the rule that you're challenging, it
will invite more lawsuits. They'll say, boy, the
Supreme Court really means it with this presumption
now.
Has that, in fact, been the case that the
presumption, at least as it has been understood up to
this point, has driven lawsuits and, in fact, has
driven lawsuits that ultimately were unsuccessful even
though the market power point was, of course,
satisfied?
MR. PINCUS: Well, there certainly have been
lawsuits that are unsuccessful, but -- but, Your Honor,
one of the problems with our litigation system is many
cases are not tried to completion on the merits,
especially expensive antitrust cases. So if a case --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but this is -- this is
basically a practical question, and I -- I'm trying to
get a -- I guess because I'm not an antitrust lawyer,
I'm trying to get a handle on how the presumption is
actually working in the system, and I'm not sure that I
understand it.
MR. PINCUS: Well, right now I would say the
presumption status is somewhat murky. When the -- when
the Antitrust Division in the FTC came out with their
guidelines and essentially disavowed and rejected the
recognition of a presumption and the Sixth Circuit also
rejected the existence of the presumption, there was a
-- both a conflict among the courts of appeals and
certainly amongst the district courts. And also, you
had the Federal regulators saying this presumption
doesn't make sense. That, I think, chilled to a large
extent -- not completely, but to some extent -- what
would otherwise have been -- what would have happened
in the lower courts if there had been a full-throated
affirmance of the presumption.
And I think the issue now is prognosticating
a bit what will happen if the Court were to affirm the
presumption. And I think it is a fair assumption that
a presumption that says if you file a lawsuit alleging
tying of a product that has a patent or is patented,
then the filing of the lawsuit plus the patent means
that the burden of market power has shifted, then if
I'm a competitor trying to put some cost on my
competitor in a market, that's a pretty low-cost thing
to do because all I do is file the lawsuit. I get the
benefit of presumption. They've got to spend the money
to disprove market power.
And the market power element is peculiarly
important in the tying context because we're dealing
here with a per se rule, although a somewhat peculiar
per se rule because it has these four prerequisites.
But the market power one is the critical one and
certainly one that the Court identified --
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose it's the other one
that's the critical one.
MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think the --
JUSTICE BREYER: And the other one being that
-- the attack on the problem is there happens to be
instances where tying is justified for procompetitive
reasons, risk-sharing, maintaining product quality,
probably Jerrold Electronics. There are a number of
them. And the real problem is that the law hasn't
admitted a defense. But where the attack should be is
on the tied product, not the tying product. What do
you think of that?
MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I -- I think
there obviously is -- a lot of commentators have
expressed concern about the -- whether the per se rule
makes sense. And -- and Justice O'Connor. writing for
four Justices in Jefferson Parish, made exactly that
point.
But I think whether or not the per se rule
applied, there's no logic underlying this presumption.
And -- and at least as the law stands now, the other
elements are their two products. There are a hundred
pages in Areeda and Turner --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you --
MR. PINCUS: -- with the jurisprudence of two
products. So that's not a test that's going to be
effective in screening out unjustified claims.
Yes, sir.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you how far your
position extends? I think there's a good argument that
if a patent is really a good patent, it doesn't really
matter whether the patentee charges a very high royalty
or gets a -- reduces the royalty and gets profits out
of the tied -- tied product.
In your view, is the rule sound that if it is
a monopoly in the tied product, that there is an
antitrust problem?
MR. PINCUS: If there's a monopoly in the
tied product?
JUSTICE STEVENS: In -- in the tying product.
Excuse me. In the tying product.
MR. PINCUS: All we're asking for is --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I know that's all you're
asking for --
MR. PINCUS: -- is the opportunity to
demonstrate market power, and if --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- but I'm just wondering
if it isn't -- if it isn't the logical conclusion of
your position that it really doesn't matter, even if
there is a monopoly in the tying product.
MR. PINCUS: No. If there is a monopoly in
the tying product, Your Honor, that's one of the
elements that the Court requires. That would be
satisfied, and obviously, the existence of the patent
would be a factor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm -- I'm asking
sort of an economic question rather than a legal
question.
MR. PINCUS: Whether even if there was a --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If your position is all the
economists say this is a lot of nonsense, I think maybe
it's a lot of nonsense even if there's a monopoly in
the tying product is what I'm suggesting.
MR. PINCUS: I think there are some that hold
that view, Your Honor, but there are some that don't.
But all agree that it is critical to show market power
in the tying product. If you can't meet that test,
there's really no problem. If you can meet that test,
then there's a division. Some say there's a problem
and some say there's not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a -- a point
that you were in the process of answering. The -- the
argument is made that this tying product had such clout
that you were able to extract not twice but three times
the price for the tied product. And you were saying no
to even double the price.
MR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor. As we note in
our reply brief, the -- the document that was the basis
of respondent's own damages study in this case said
that the average price charged by Trident was $85. So
there's no proof of that. And the district court
specifically found, in fact, that respondent was not
relying on so-called direct evidence of market power in
this case, such as supracompetitive prices.
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Pincus.
Mr. Hungar, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The presumption that patents confer market
power is counterfactual, inconsistent with this
Court's modern antitrust jurisprudence, out of step
with congressional action in the patent area, contrary
to the views of leading antitrust commentators and the
Federal antitrust enforcement agencies, and
unnecessarily harmful to intellectual property rights
and procompetitive conduct. For all those reasons, the
presumption should be rejected.
There's no plausible economic basis for
inferring market power from the mere fact that a
defendant has a patent on a tying product. As this
Court has recognized, many commercially viable products
are the subject of patents that do not confer market
power because there are reasonable substitutes. Nor
does the combination of a tie in a patent provide a
valid basis for presuming market power. The patent may
be entirely incidental and tying is ubiquitous in fully
competitive markets.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Hungar, is the issue
of the presumption, as it applies to copyright, part of
the question presented? And do we have to decide that
issue here?
MR. HUNGAR: Strictly speaking, it's not,
Your Honor, because of course, this is a patent case.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.
MR. HUNGAR: And the only case in which this
Court has actually applied a presumption of economic
power is the Loew's case, which was a copyright case.
In fairness, however, Loew's based the presumption that
it recognized in the copyright context entirely on the
reasoning of the patent misuse cases. So a -- a
holding that there is no presumption in the patent
context would eviscerate the underlying rationale for
Loew's.
Indeed, as we explain in our brief, Congress
in our view has already done that because, again,
Loew's expressly states that the rationale for the
presumption it adopts is that in the patent misuse
cases, the Court has -- at that time, had rejected any
attempt to extend the monopoly. But Congress, in 1988
in the Patent Misuse Reform Act, overruled those cases
and held that there cannot be patent misuse in the
absence of an actual showing, based on all the
circumstances, of market power. So the rationale and
underpinnings of Loew's have been entirely repudiated,
which is one of the reasons why we think that this
Court ought to make it clear that there is no
presumption of market power in a tying case where
there --
JUSTICE BREYER: And market power -- you mean
price -- ability to charge a price higher than
otherwise would be the case?
--
MR. HUNGAR: As this Court defined market
power --
JUSTICE BREYER: As you're defining it. As
you're defining.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, yes. The ability to raise
price --
JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then you're talking
about patents where the person who paid for the
attorney went to the Patent Office and so forth. That
was just a mistake.
MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. Certainly many
patents are valueless, which is one of the reasons why
JUSTICE BREYER: But then are you relying on
that, the existence of valueless patents?
MR. HUNGAR: Well, that's -- that's part but
not all.
JUSTICE BREYER: If you're going beyond that,
which patents are you talking about?
MR. HUNGAR: Patents can be valuable, but not
confer meaningful, significant market power. What this
Court said in Jefferson Parish is significant market
power. I mean, there can be lots of circumstances in
which a competitor has the ability for some customers
in some circumstances to raise price to some extent,
but we wouldn't consider that significant market power.
And patents can confer value in other ways.
For instance, in many high-tech industries in the
modern high-tech environment, a patent library is
necessary merely in order to get cross licenses from
your competitors that would allow each of you to
compete. They're fully competitive markets, but
without a patent library, you can't get in the door.
And all the competitors have their patent libraries and
they agree to cross licenses to avoid the -- the
inconvenience and cost of patent infringement.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, I see.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Hungar, one of the
amicus briefs for the respondent was submitted by a
professor, I think, named Barry Nalebuff --
MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- which took the view
that the Court should, in any event, retain the
presumption where a patent is being used to impose a
variable or a requirements tie. Do you have any
comment on that view?
MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. We think
that's wrong for several reasons.
In the first place, the presumption
recognized in Loew's, of course, has nothing to do with
a requirements tie. So, in effect, what that brief is
urging the Court to do is not to retain the Loew's
presumption but, rather, to create a new one. And
there is certainly not the requisite evidentiary basis
or consensus among --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it wouldn't be a new
one. It would be just following the old IBM case and
all those cases.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, Your Honor, those -- those
cases don't state a presumption of market power.
Market power wasn't even relevant in those days.
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but that's the example
they're saying it would be following. It's not a brand
new idea.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, it is a brand new idea in
the sense that they would -- they would ask the Court
to adopt a presumption of market power, which the Court
did not recognize in the IBM case or any of those cases
because market power was not a part of the analysis in
those cases. It wasn't relevant. It wasn't relevant
in the -- even in the International Salt case where the
Court -- where the Court later made clear that the --
the ability to prove the absence of market power was
deemed irrelevant by the Court in International Salt.
Market power's relevance didn't even begin to be
recognized --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But your -- your answer to
Justice O'Connor is there should be no distinction even
if there is evidence that there's a long-term
relationship, a requirements relationship, and an
increase in price.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, an increase in price is a
separate issue which might or might not, depending on
the circumstances, be probative of market power in the
-- in the tied product market or, again, depending on
the circumstances, it might be probative of market
power in the tying market and certainly a plaintiff
would be able to rely on such evidence if they could
establish it.
But the -- the fact of a requirements tie,
standing alone together with a patent, is not
meaningfully probative of market power. His
thesis is that requirements tie is always used for
metering, and metering is evidence of price
discrimination, and price discrimination is evidence of
market power. But again, there's a great deal of
disagreement and, indeed, the majority view is that
price discrimination is not necessarily or even usually
evidence of market power. In fact, price
discrimination is common in entirely competitive
markets such as grocery retailing, airline industry,
and many other contexts. So -- so the -- the logic of
the -- of the presumption he urges doesn't even hold
together, and certainly there isn't the relevant -- the
requisite consensus that would justify the fashioning
of a new presumption that has never been recognized by
the Court before.
The Loew's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the Government
have -- I'd like to ask you the same question Justice
Stevens asked Mr. Pincus about the broader question.
Much of the economic literature on which you rely sort
of sweeps aside the particular question today because
it rejects the notion of tying as a problem in the
first place. But does the Government have a position
on that? Assuming there's monopoly power in the tying
product, the Government's position is that that still
presents an antitrust problem?
MR. HUNGAR: Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is not part of
a broader approach to get rid of the tying issue
altogether, is it?
MR. HUNGAR: Certainly we have not asked the
Court to -- to do that, and that's not necessary to
address in this case. The -- they're really two
separate issues. That is, is it -- is it rational to
presume market power from the existence of a patent is
quite separate and distinct in our view from the
question whether it's rational to have a per se tying
rule when there is market power. They're completely
distinct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and what is
the Government's position on the latter question?
MR. HUNGAR: Well, Justice O'Connor made
persuasive points in her concurring opinion in
Jefferson Parish in which she explained why, in the
view of those Justices, that the per se rule does not
make a whole lot of economic sense. We have not taken
a position on that question in this case because, in
our view, it's not necessary to reach that in order to
reverse the judgment below which -- which rests
entirely on the presumption.
The Loew's presumption is also, in our view,
undermined by this Court's modern antitrust cases, such
as Jefferson Parish and Eastman Kodak, because the
presumption -- the fact that the Loew's presumption
recognizes is not market power in the modern sense of
the term, as it is understood and required under
Eastman Kodak and Jefferson Parish. Rather, what the
Loew's Court said is that uniqueness suffices to
establish the requisite economic power regardless of
the ability to control price. The Court specifically
said on page 45 of the decision that -- that ability to
control price need not be shown. That's a different
fact that -- that is being presumed in Loew's than the
fact that is now required as part of the Court's modern
per se tying jurisprudence, which is actual,
significant market power.
So even if the Loew's presumption had any
continuing force, which we don't think it does, it
doesn't presume the relevant fact under this Court's
modern cases. So for that reason as well, the judgment
of the court of appeals is incorrect.
As has been discussed, we think that the
presumption is not only wrong but has deleterious
consequences. It essentially imposes a litigation tax
on the ownership of intellectual property and -- and --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't that also true
even if there's monopoly power? That's what -- I
really think it's a very interesting question as to
whether it makes any difference whether the monopolist
who happened to have a patent just charges high prices
for product A or decides to charge a little less for
product A and make hay out of product B.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, as Justice O'Connor
explained in her Jefferson Parish concurrence, there's
significant force to that argument. But -- but again,
it's not presented here because there's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No. I understand it's not.
I'm just kind of curious about where we're going down
-- we're going down a new road in this whole area. I'm
just wondering how -- what our destination is.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, I think, as I said, those
are completely separate and -- and really, I would say,
unrelated points because what we're talking about here
is not whether -- whether market power is relevant, but
rather, whether the plaintiff should be required to
prove an element of its case, which is the normal rule
that this Court and the lower courts apply in -- in the
whole array of contexts, including in antitrust cases
in every other context.
JUSTICE STEVENS: We're talking about
components, for example. It doesn't seem to me it
makes any difference whether General Motors has a
monopoly or not when it wants to sell, you know, two
components as part of the same package. Anyway, I've
gone astray too much.
MR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Hungar.
Ms. Sullivan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Petitioners and the Government have fallen
far short of the -- meeting the burden that would be
required to overrule a presumption that has been in
force for nearly 60 years since the International Salt
decision, a presumption that, as Justice Stevens
acknowledged, reflected the Court's prior experience
dating back to the enactment of the Clayton Act in 1914
with the use of patents to enforce requirements ties
like the one at issue here, buy our printhead and you
have to buy our ink at whatever price we set for the
life of the product, even after the patent has expired.
It was precisely the Court's experience with
a series of patent cases in which such requirements
ties had been imposed that led it to set forth the
presumption in International Salt.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, this isn't a
requirements tie case, is it?
MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor.
This is absolutely a requirements tie case. This is a
case in which Independent Ink seeks to sell ink that is
required to operate Trident's printheads, their
piezoelectric impulse ink jet printheads used to put
carton coding directly onto cartons. And the
requirement here -- a requirements tie is that if you
buy our good A, you need to buy good B that's a
necessary --
JUSTICE BREYER: But that --
MS. SULLIVAN: -- operating it in perpetuity.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- that, I would think,
would be one of the strongest cases for not having a
per se rule because if, in fact, you have a
justification, in terms of sharing risk with a new
product, that would be one of the cases where you would
expect to find a tie. And -- and so I'm not really
very persuaded by the effort to draw a wedge between
requirements and other things.
But what I do find very difficult about this
case is -- you can see from what I'm saying -- that at
the bottom, I think there are cases where tying is
justified. But the way to attack that would be to say
here, here, and here it's justified and that would have
to do with the tied product. It would abolish the per
se rule, making it into a semi-per se rule.
But here, we're attacking a different thing.
We're attacking the screen, which is a -- the tying
product. Now there, that's just a screen. And -- and
so I'm -- I'm not certain whether attacking the screen
and insisting on a higher standard of proof is better
than nothing or whether you should say, well, leave the
screen alone and let's deal with the tied product on
the merits. That I think is what Justice Stevens was
getting at too.
And -- and I'm -- I'm not being too clear.
You understand where I'm coming from, and I -- I want
you to say what you want about that. But that's what's
bothering me here.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, this is not
Jerrold Electronics. There's no indication that in
this case there was any price discount given on the
printheads in order to make it up through a
supracompetitive royalty payment extracted from the end
users by requiring them to pay three times the market
for ink. The end users are charged three times what
Independent Ink would sell them the ink for directly.
And -- and the original equipment manufacturers, the
printers who put the Trident printhead into the printer
to sell to the end users like General Mills and Gallo
Wines -- they're charged twice the price. So there is
a markup on the ink. This is a case in which a
supracompetitive profit is being extracted as a kind of
royalty on the ink sales for life.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. This case isn't
what's bothering me.
MS. SULLIVAN: No. Justice Breyer, if I
could just remind us how narrow the presumption is
here. The presumption here attaches to one element in
a tying case. There are still other screens. The
other screens -- the plaintiff still bears the proof of
showing that there are two separate products. As
Justice Kennedy pointed out, if two products are
bundled together, if the tie is bundling two products
together, there may well be a single product. If
there's a procompetitive reason for a bundle, that will
be screened out by the requirement that a tie involved
tying product A to product B. If products A and B are
combined as components in a single product, the screen
of separability will operate. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this in -- as a
practical matter, this screen is really the heavy
lifting in the antitrust cases. This is where you need
all the economic studies, you have the discovery, the
experts. This is what costs a lot of money and shifts
a lot of the litigation burden on the other side if you
have a presumption.
MS. SULLIVAN: With respect, Mr. Chief
Justice, this does not entail a heavy burden on the
defendant. What the presumption does is simply presume
from a patent used to effect, as here, a requirements
tie. And Justice O'Connor, it's not just a component
in the larger product. The patent has to be used
through the licensing of the patent to effect the tie.
We're not suggesting that the presumption attaches to
any product that happens to contain a patent in the
component.
But when that happens, Mr. Chief Justice, the
-- when the patent is used through its license to exact
in perpetuity -- you have to buy a requirement for life
-- it is quite fair to ask the defendant to come
forward and say, well, that's not so bad because there
are reasonable substitutes. We just looked at them
when we got our patent in order to show that it was
novel. We looked at what the prior art was, and we've
studied our competitors and the printhead market
closely --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except that the --
the Chief -- Chief Justice's question -- and it -- it's
the same question as Justice Souter had and is what
concerns me. My -- my understanding -- and it's not an
understanding based on any experience litigating in
this area -- is that when you hire economists, in order
to establish market power, this is a substantial
undertaking. It's -- it's a significant part of
litigation costs. And what you're saying is that this
is an important rule so that we -- we vindicate the
important rule by putting the presumption on -- on the
defendant. But you can say that with many important
rules in many other areas.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, the patent
presumption makes economic sense because, more likely
than not, a patent used to effect a requirements tie
will have market power. Justice Breyer said at the
outset that a patent is intended to confer market
power. That's what a patent is -- is registered for.
It's intended to create legally enforceable barriers to
entry that make it rivals -- entrance into the market
more difficult. That's what it's intended to do. It
doesn't matter that 95 percent --
JUSTICE SCALIA: More often than not, it
doesn't.
MS. SULLIVAN: 95 percent of patents are
valueless according to petitioners' own statistics, but
they won't arise in a patent tying case because if
they're valueless, they won't be licensed. And if
they're not licensed, they can't be used to effect the
tie.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that isn't so. I
mean, you could have a patent that was valueless or
didn't itself confer very much, but the person is
trying to establish the market for the product. It's a
component, and he attaches this tied product as a
counting device knowing that if it's successful,
everybody makes money, and if it's not successful, he
and everybody else lose. That's -- that's the kind of
justification. And that could happen with --
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, Justice Souter
asked before to petitioners' counsel, has there been
any evidence of frivolous litigation, tying litigation,
brought where there was a valueless patent to which a
tie to a requirement was -- was made, and petitioners'
counsel could name none.
The focus here has been on the wrong pool.
The arguments are about valueless patents, which
there's no evidence they've been used to tie --
JUSTICE BREYER: Let me be more specific. A
person has a patent on an item in a machine. This is a
great machine. It's fabulous. We've all had friends
who have tried to get us to invest in such machines.
We don't know what it does, nor does anyone.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOUTER: But if it's a success, we'll
all be rich.
Now, he decides to tie something to that.
MS. SULLIVAN: To try to --
JUSTICE BREYER: To tie something to the
great machine.
MS. SULLIVAN: To make up the money through a
requirements tie in perpetuity.
JUSTICE BREYER: Correct, if it takes off.
MS. SULLIVAN: If it takes off.
JUSTICE BREYER: If it takes off, everybody
will be rich, and if it doesn't take off, who cares.
Now --
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- that could happen.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice --
JUSTICE BREYER: And there often does, I
guess.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, that couldn't
happen unless there was market power in the patented
product. There's reason -- there's no reason why a
consumer would agree to pay supracompetitive prices for
the requirement --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'll put this machine in
your store for a penny. A penny.
MS. SULLIVAN: Not the case here.
--
JUSTICE BREYER: By the way, a penny and you
have to buy marvelous component. And by the way, if it
takes off, you'll buy a lot of marvelous component, and
if not, not.
MS. SULLIVAN: This returns us to Justice
Stevens' question. Can metering be procompetitive?
And the petitioners and Government have utterly failed
to show how metering could be procompetitive in a
requirements tie case. The briefs of Professor
Nalebuff and Professor Scherer, the only economist
briefs submitted in the case, show how metering is not
necessarily efficient. Even if it produces -- produces
some kind of gain to production, it transfers surplus
from consumers.
And in any event, metering -- if -- if the
goal here were to try to impose the royalty on the ink,
if the goal here -- if -- if Trident really wanted to
say we want to be efficient price discriminators, we're
charging less for the printhead -- and there's no
evidence there was any kind of discount on the
printhead here. This is not a penny for the product.
These are $10,000 printheads that go into $20,000
printers that last for 20 years. So this is not --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I have to interrupt to say
--
MS. SULLIVAN: -- the discount case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- I think your opponent
would say the district court made a finding to the
contrary.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, we believe
the district court erred in holding that there was no
JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.
MS. SULLIVAN: -- direct evidence of market
power here, and we urge, as an alternative ground for
affirmance, that there's ample direct evidence of
market power here.
Mr. Chief Justice?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If your -- if your
arguments are right, isn't that going to typically be
the case? In which case, why do you need a presumption
at all?
MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, that is not
typically going to be the case. This is an unusual
case in that the direct evidence of market power comes
from defendants' own customer surveys, which at pages
3-394 of the joint appendix indicate that the
customers here were deeply dissatisfied with having to
pay supracompetitive prices for ink when Independent
Ink and other independent providers were offering them
discounted ink on the market. The license here
precluded either the original equipment manufacturers
or the end users from buying that ink. The license
extends to customers of Trident and to their end users.
And the original equipment manufacturers were deeply
dissatisfied.
Jefferson Parish says that there's evidence
of market power when a -- the producer in the tying
product market is able to impose onerous conditions
that it could not impose in a competitive market --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the -- the only issue is
who has to prove that. I mean, you -- you could find
out who their customers are in -- in discovery and --
and go to their customers and then, you know, show that
all of the customers are dissatisfied and wouldn't buy
-- wouldn't buy the machine -- wouldn't buy the ink
were it not that they needed the machine. I mean, it's
just a question of -- of who has to prove it. That's
all.
MS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Justice
Scalia, but it's -- there -- there -- it would take a
far better showing than the petitioners and the
Government have made to overturn a sensible rule of
thumb that makes sense as a matter of theory and makes
sense of -- as a matter of practice. They've failed to
indicate a single case in which there's been frivolous
litigation over a patent tie. The presumption, if it
was going to unleash this wave of frivolous litigation
because the screen was too low, you would think that
they could name a single case over the last 60 years in
which that occurred.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't know how many
people paid -- paid off the plaintiff. We -- you know,
frivolous litigation becomes evident only when it
proceeds far enough that it's -- it's reported.
What -- what I assume would happen most often
is that the -- the person who has the patent would just
say it's just not worth the litigation. Here. Go
away. We don't know how much of that there is.
MS. SULLIVAN: Well, in this case that isn't
so because the petitioner initiated the litigation.
Let us remember that this case began as a patent
infringement action in which Trident came after
Independent Ink for patent infringement claims, which
were dismissed with prejudice by the district court,
found to be unsustainable.
But, Mr. Chief Justice, just to go back to
the direct evidence point, you asked before isn't
market power doing all the heavy lifting. Market power
can be shown through expert evidence, and that's what
the district court erroneously said that we had failed
to provide.
But it can also be shown, as this Court has
acknowledged in Kodak, as -- and in FTC v. Indiana
Dentists, market power can be shown directly. If
there's direct evidence of anticompetitive effects in
the tied product market -- here, three times the price
one wants to pay for ink in order to use the patented
printhead for 20 years and thereafter -- if there's
evidence directly of anticompetitive effect in the
tying -- in the tied product market, then there's no
need for that expert evidence.
This happens to be the rare case in which the
petitioner was cooperative enough to have taken
customer surveys showing the -- the dissatisfaction its
customers had over a long period of years with having
to pay supracompetitive prices for ink. But that won't
be the general case.
And in other cases, the patent rule is a
sensible rule of thumb -- the patent presumption, not a
rule, is a sensible rule of thumb for capturing the
wisdom that patents used to enforce requirements ties
are more likely than not to show market power. That's
what they're intended to do through barriers to entry,
and that's what they have done. In fact, the
petitioners and Government have been able -- unable to
show a single procompetitive requirements tie.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you conceding
that the presumption makes no sense outside of the
requirements metering context?
MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, there could
be a sensible argument that you should always presume
requirements ties to indicate market power. That's not
the law, and we don't urge it here. We think that you
capture the same point if you retain the presumption,
as it was stated in Salt, as it was restated again by
this Court in Jefferson Parish, as -- by the Court in
Loew's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm kind of curious what
your answer is to the Chief Justice's question.
(Laughter.)
MS. SULLIVAN: Do we -- we argue that the
rule should continue to be, as it has always been, that
when a patent is used to enforce a tie for a
requirement -- sorry -- when a patent is used to
enforce a tie, that's presumptive evidence of market
power.
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the question is
does the presumption make any sense at all outside of
the requirements context.
MS. SULLIVAN: We -- it -- it's not the law
and we don't urge it in any other context. You need
not reach, Justice O'Connor, the question of copyrights
here. They are not presented. Loew's was a copyright
bundling case. This is a patent requirements case, and
that's all that's at issue.
JUSTICE BREYER: Let me try this again, and
I'm thinking of a way of saying this more clearly.
This is my actual dilemma.
If I decide this case against you in my view
-- and suppose it came out that way -- I would be
concerned lest there be a lot of big companies in the
technology area that have real market power in tying
products and get people -- and they extend that power
through a tie into a second market and thereby insulate
themselves from attack. I would be afraid of that
really happening, and everything gets mixed up in a war
of experts in a technology area about do we have the
power, don't we have the power, and who knows.
If I decide this case in your favor, I would
then be afraid that particularly in the patent area,
there will be lots of instances where new technology,
uncertain technology, uncertain new technology, does
not get off the ground because a very easy way to
finance the risk through a requirements contract, for
--
example, so that we make the money if the product
succeeds, because people buy the required product at a
higher price. That will never happen. And patents is
an area where new technology is particularly at risk.
So I see a problem both ways, and I'm really
not certain what to do.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, you should
affirm the court of appeals.
(Laughter.)
MS. SULLIVAN: The reason is that we've had
the patent presumption for 60 years. It is not murky.
It is not the least bit murky. Congress is open,
willing, and -- and able to change this Court's rulings
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why can Congress --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, didn't they do
that? Didn't they do that in the Patent Misuse Reform
Act?
MS. SULLIVAN: They -- they did not. They
did not, Mr. Chief Justice. The Patent Misuse Reform
Act of 1988 eliminated a market power presumption as a
patent misuse defense to an infringement action -- in
-- in a patent misuse defense to an infringement
action. But Congress declined to remove the
presumption from the antitrust laws. And while
congressional inaction might not always be a good guide
to what Congress is thinking, here the Senate actually
placed legislation in the -- in the bill that was sent
to the House to remove the presumption from the
antitrust laws as well, and the House took it out and
the Senate acquiesced.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But isn't it
logically inconsistent for Congress --
MS. SULLIVAN: Not at --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to say that a
patent is insufficient evidence of market power in the
misuse context and then just turn around and say, but
if you're having a straight lawsuit under antitrust, it
is sufficient as a presumption?
MS. SULLIVAN: It's not inconsistent, Your
Honor, at all because the patent misuse context lacks
the other screens that are present here, the other
screens that are present here from the other elements,
and the affirmative defenses, like the business
justification defense in Jerrold Electronics, like the
business justification defense in Microsoft. The --
the other --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it gets back to
how important you think and how -- whether it's true or
not that the market power is the heavy lifting, as far
as all these screens go.
MS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Your Honor.
We believe that if -- the narrowness of the presumption
here is we're only talking about patent cases, not
copyright cases. We're only talking about one element
of four. The plaintiff still bears the burden on
substantial effect on commerce, separate products, and
forcing. There is still affirmative defenses available
to the plaintiff. In your case --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, once you start
that, then you're saying that -- which I thought was
the -- I would have agreed with the dissent -- the
concurrence in -- in Jefferson Parish, but that's not
the law. And so now what you're saying is, well, we
have to go and really make that the law.
MS. SULLIVAN: No, no, not --
JUSTICE BREYER: If you're going to give me
-- if you're going -- well.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, with respect
to your concerns about stopping innovation, there's no
reason to think that the presumption of market power in
a patent tying case has had the slightest adverse
effect on the important new technological developments
you've described. To the contrary, patents have
increased exponentially in the 20 years since Jefferson
Parish restated the presumption of market power in --
in a patent case.
So the -- the fears about innovation have --
the burden is on the petitioners and the Government to
show that a 60-year-old rule, settled precedent of this
Court, in a statutory case in which Congress is free to
overrule it and which it hasn't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask your point
on that? You are giving -- your main argument is there
are good reasons to retain this presumption. But then
you said even if there aren't, leave it to Congress.
The Court created this rule, the market power rule, not
Congress. Why, when we're dealing with a Court-created
rule, should we say, well, the Court has had it in play
for 60 years, so it's the legislature's job to fix it
up, instead of the Court correcting its own erroneous
way?
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, the
presumption here arises in a very special statutory
context. The Clayton Act was passed in 1914 in
response to a decision of this Court which Congress
viewed as erroneously upholding a patent tie just like
the one here. A.B. Dick wanted to sell you its
mimeograph machine only if you bought its fluid and
stencil paper in perpetuity from A.B. Dick. It was
Congress' dissatisfaction with permitting such a -- the
anticompetitive effects of such a patent requirements
tie that led to the passage of the Clayton Act. And so
the presumption of stare decisis with respect to this
Court's rules to effectuate the anti-tying goals of the
Clayton Act is accorded -- should be accorded more weight
than just ordinary common law --
JUSTICE STEVENS: As I remember the text of
section 3, it applies to other products patented or
unpatented.
MS. SULLIVAN: It does. It does, indeed,
Justice Stevens. It eliminated a patent exemption from
the antitrust laws.
But we're not suggesting that patented and
unpatented products are -- are different with respect
to the showing of market power. Both have to be shown
to have market power when they're used to effect a tie.
We're simply arguing that when the -- when a patent is
used to force the tie, it makes sense -- it makes good
economic sense today, as it did in 1914, and in all the
cases that led up to International Salt -- to assume
that it's only through market power that the patent is
able to effect -- effectuate the tie.
Patents are intended to confer market power.
They do in a small set of cases. Professor Scherer,
whose amicus brief supports the presumption, has
demonstrated that there's an innovation lottery in
which only some patents are successful, but those that
are successful are highly successful, highly valuable.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We're not even sure, are we,
Ms. Sullivan, that -- that you can extend, assuming
that there is market power in the patent -- we're not
really sure that you can extend it through tying. I
mean, there's -- there's dispute among the economists
even on that question.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Scalia, the -- the
economic theories that focus on the relevant pool,
which is patents that have sufficiently high value to
be used to enforce a tie, is unanimously on our side
that there's no procompetitive value, that there are
anticompetitive effects.
JUSTICE BREYER: There are no -- I thought we
were just talking about several.
MS. SULLIVAN: The -- they're focusing on the
pool. Petitioners and the Government have cited a
number of economists who talk about price
discrimination in the abstract. We're not talking here
about senior citizen discounts at the movies. We're
talking about price discrimination with respect to a
tying market, in which, by the way, the dangers of
shrouding information to the consumer are demonstrated
by this case.
The -- the petitioners --
JUSTICE BREYER: Price discrimination, I
gather, sometimes good, sometimes not. If it pushes
out sales --
MS. SULLIVAN: But the --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- on the low side, it's
good. If it just extracts profits on the high side,
it's bad.
MS. SULLIVAN: It --
JUSTICE BREYER: And so I think most
economists -- in fact, everyone I've ever read agrees
with that.
MS. SULLIVAN: Most -- the majority view is
that price discrimination does reflect market power,
that you can't discriminate without it, and that's
reflected in Judge Posner's recent decisions, for
example.
So if they're -- if they're using metering
here to price discriminate, all the more reason for you
to uphold the presumption here because the metering is
being used to price discriminate the very thing that
shows there's market power.
But if -- to go back to Justice Stevens'
point about whether metering can ever be a good way for
the monopolist to take his profit on the ink, rather
than on the printhead, there's very good reason to
think it's bad, inefficient, and certainly bad for
consumers for the monopolist to take his profit on the
ink rather than on the printhead because the consumer
can't make, as this Court pointed out in Eastman Kodak,
a good judgment at the beginning of how much ink he's
going to need for the life of the product and what it's
going to cost.
And in this case, petitioners did everything
possible to keep its -- its customers from knowing what
the ink would cost over its lifetime. On page 396 of
the appendix, you'll see the customers complaining in
petitioners' own survey that they couldn't get the ink
consumption rates out of Trident.
This is a case in which, if you shroud to the
consumer the true life cycle cost of using the
printhead with the ink need -- needed to run it, you're
going to create lots of inefficiencies in the market.
You're going to create, first of all, the
inefficiencies of enforcing the tie. You're going to
create the inefficiencies and social costs of creating
alternative routes when the customers seek to go
elsewhere. Think of chop shops for auto parts.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, one of the
interesting aspects of this kind of discrimination is
the victim of the discrimination is the more powerful
buyer in these cases.
MS. SULLIVAN: Well, we would argue that the
presumption makes sense no matter whether the patentee
is a big or a small company, and the reason is, to go
back to Justice Scalia's question, that the -- the
patentee will always have better information about the
market for the tying product. Here, Trident is the
expert in printheads. Independent Ink, the plaintiff,
doesn't know about printheads. It knows about ink.
For Independent Ink to try to show that there are no
reasonable substitutes for the printhead is a very
arduous burden to place on Independent Ink, whereas
it's a very sensible burden to place on the defendant
to say, show us that there are reasonable,
noninfringing substitutes for your printhead.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You could probably say that
in every -- in -- in every antitrust case where --
where the defendant is -- is alleging a -- a monopoly
on the part of the plaintiff. It's almost always the
case that the plaintiff knows -- knows more about his
business than the defendant does. It's not distinctive
here, it seems to me.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Scalia, we argue
simply that it's fair to shift the burden to the
defendant. Remember, this is a narrow presumption.
It's not a per se invalidity rule. It's just a
rebuttable presumption.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But isn't -- it's in
fact easier for you here. You can go down to the
Patent Office and see what they've distinguished as --
the sense in which their product is an innovation and
why it's not just like the other products that might be
available that you could use.
MS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Mr. Chief
Justice. But it is harder for us to find out what new
competitors have come into the tying product market in
the meantime, and it is easier for defendants to prove
the affirmative, that there is a reasonable substitute.
Of course, in their own promotions and advertising,
they said that nothing else is as good as their
printer. But it's reasonable to ask them to prove that
there is a reasonable substitute. It's far harder to
ask the plaintiff to prove that there's no reasonable
substitute because we don't have access to the
information about their competitors that they could be
expected to keep as a matter of ordinary business
records.
But, Justice Ginsburg, to return to your
point, if there's any doubt about whether metering can
ever be efficient, if there's any doubt about whether
there could be a procompetitive reason for a
requirements tie, evidence that has utterly been failed
to be presented here, where there's no economist brief
on their side and several economist briefs on our side
by very distinguished economists cited by the other
side, if there is any doubt about that kind of economic
wisdom, then indeed it should be decided by Congress.
It's a matter of economic policy to be decided by
Congress. Congress has not only failed to reform the
antitrust laws in 1988, when it looked at a bill that
the Senate had written and the House rejected it, it's
failed five times since then to reject this
presumption. So there's nothing murky about the
presumption. It's still the law.
If petitioners really believe they can come
forward with an economic record they haven't come forward
with so far, Congress is open and able to correct it.
But when this Court has guided plaintiffs and defendants
for 60 years with a presumption that still makes good
economic sense -- and Justice Stevens, if there were
anything to the metering argument, why wouldn't Trident
simply put a counting chip in the printhead and say we're
going to charge you a per-use fee? Every time you put a
bar code on a carton, you pay us a royalty. That would be
the way to have metering and to capture the monopoly
profit through the ink market without all the
inefficiencies that come with tying the -- the sales of
ink, keeping other rivals out of the ink market --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I suppose you can do that
under modern computer technology. You couldn't have
done it 20 years ago.
MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, that's
correct. Had -- had that technology existed in 1984,
maybe Jefferson Parish might have mentioned it. But
it's certainly the case that today there's no reason
for -- to get the efficiency gains from metering
through tying arrangements. Tying arrangements are a
very inefficient way of getting the efficiency gains
from metering when there is this completely transparent
alternative. Trident might not want to tell people
what it's really costing them to put a bar code on a
carton because if you tell the consumer, they might
defect. But it -- the -- the metering argument is
satisfied by a transparent use of counting technology
today.
So there's no procompetitive reason here.
This is not a bundle. This is not a case where, as the
concurring opinion in Jefferson Parish suggested, there
might be very sensible ways to see efficiencies in a
bundle where I buy two products at the same time, an
air -- a car that comes with tires and an air
conditioner. But it's quite a different matter because
the cost savings from that accrue to the consumer.
There are efficiencies that can be passed on to the
consumer by bundling two products that can be
simultaneously purchased and consumed together.
But this is a requirements tie case. There's
no efficiency that's been demonstrated in selling the
car but requiring you to buy gasoline from the car
manufacturer for the rest of the life of the car, long
after any patents exist. And in the absence of that
kind of evidence, there's no reason to overrule a
sensible rule that does not just date to Loew's, as Mr.
Hungar incorrectly suggested. It dates back to Salt,
to 1947 for arguments in our -- we've argued in our
brief that Salt had to depend on the presumption.
And the Court was -- with respect to the
petitioners' argument that the Court didn't know what
it was doing when it decided those cases, we
respectfully disagree. The Court was well aware, as it
indicated 2 years later in Standard Stations that there
might be some substitutes for a patented product, and
it reaffirmed the -- the presumption anyway.
The presumption makes good economic sense.
It makes good litigation sense.
And -- and as an alternative to the argument
that you should affirm the Federal Circuit on the
presumption, we respectfully suggest that there's --
there was direct evidence of market power here, the
supracompetitive prices charged on ink to both the
original equipment manufacturers and the end users, the
customer dissatisfaction displayed in the petitioners'
own customer surveys in the joint appendix at 393.
But, Mr. Chief Justice, that is the unusual case. It
won't be every case in which a defendant is so
imprudent as to create a -- a record of its own
anticompetitive effects on its tying -- on its tied
product requirements market.
And in the other cases, it would be a --
there's danger, Justice Breyer, that -- there's been no
harm to innovation shown here. The presumption has
been in effect for 60 years, but there could be grave
danger to this Court lifting it. There may be many
meritorious anticompetition cases screened out by that
rule. So we respectfully urge you affirm the Federal
Circuit.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.
Sullivan.
Mr. Pincus, you have 2-and-a-half minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Just a few points.
With respect to respondent's last argument
about affirming on the basis of direct evidence, that's
an argument that the district court found to have been
waived. On page 30a of the joint -- of the appendix to
the petition, the court noted that the plaintiff
prefers no direct evidence of market power, such as
supracompetitive prices. And in fact, the price
evidence that they rely on here was not even cited or
attached to the summary judgment motions on the market
power issue.
Respondent's argument is a little peculiar.
It -- it basically is because we can't establish a
procompetitive justification for this particular tie,
the presumption should be upheld. Of course, the issue
in the district court wasn't whether or not this tie
was procompetitive, so we didn't introduce evidence
about whether or not the tie was procompetitive. We
introduced evidence about market power because the
issue was market power. I think respondent is putting
the cart before the horse here in that respect.
And there is no consensus of economists. And
we discuss this on pages 11 to 13 of our reply brief,
that respondent's syllogism of metering equals
requirements tie equals proof of market power. Each of
those three things are wrong. There are procompetitive
justifications for metering. Metering and price
discrimination is not evidence of -- of market power of
the type that the Court required in Jefferson Parish.
It's evidence of some modicum of market power, but not
enough market power to meet the tying requirement. And
-- and I -- that's very clear from the economic
literature.
And there are other justifications that are
advanced. In this case preservation of quality was
advanced as a justification. But that's why the market
power issue is so important. It is the principal
screen that -- that the lower courts used.
Respondent mentioned no proof of frivolous
litigation. On page 13 of the petition, we cite a
number -- page 23 of the petition. I'm sorry. We cite
a number of lower court decisions granting summary
judgment for defendants in cases where, once the
presumption fell out of the case, there was no proof of
market power. So there is quite a record here of this
presumption -- attempts to misuse this presumption.
Respondent also talks about -- frames the
presumption as patents used to enforce a tie, as if the
presumption required some causal connection between the
patent and the tie. It doesn't. All the presumption
requires is that the tying product be patented. It
doesn't require anything about --

Pincus.
