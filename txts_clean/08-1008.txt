ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NELSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Since the inception of the Rules Enabling
Act, this Court has repeatedly held that within their
scope of operation, rules promulgated under that Act
govern the practice and procedure of Federal courts in
diversity and Federal question cases alike.
This case concerns whether a New York State
law prohibiting New York State courts from certifying a
class applies in a Federal diversity action and
displaces the otherwise applicable Federal class
certification standards set forth in Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 23.
Whether the case is viewed as presenting a
question under the Rules Enabling Act as construed in
Hanna v. Plumer, or instead more generally as an Erie
question, the answer is the same. The State rule does
not govern. That result is underscored by the Class
Action Fairness Act, which extended Federal diversity
jurisdiction to cases of this type precisely so that
Federal procedural standards would apply. In the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is a procedural
standard that has a manifestly substantive purpose,
which is to restrict recoveries of penalties. In that
sense, it's like a cap on damages. And if you're right,
then the purpose that New York had would be completely
undermined, because what lawyer would bring a $500 case
in State court when she could bring a $5 million case in
Federal court?
MR. NELSON: Well, to begin with, I –- I
don't think that it's a substantive rule because it
reflects a policy. The policy here, as described by the
New York Court of Appeals in the Sperry case, is that
the -- the legislature believed that class actions were
not necessary in this category of cases.
I think that is ultimately a procedural
policy. It's not a limitation on --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They didn't want to have
class actions.
MR. NELSON: They certainly did not want to
have class actions, Justice Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how is it different
from Cohen v. Beneficial, the security for costs?
Procedural in one sense, but with a definite substantive
purpose in mind; that is, to restrict derivative
actions.
MR. NELSON: Well, the Cohen case I think is
different in this respect, although when Cohen was
decided shareholder derivative actions together with
class actions were under Rule 23.
Those things have now been divorced, and
shareholder derivative actions differ from class actions
in the Rule 23 sense in a fundamental way. In Rule 23,
the class is composed solely of individuals who each
have a substantive right to pursue that recovery under
the relevant law. In a derivative action, the plaintiff
is actually asserting a substantive right to -- to
really assert a claim on behalf of someone else, the
corporation.
And what the Court said in Cohen and
elaborated more in the Kamen case in 1991 is that that
question is really a matter of the law of
shareholder-corporate relations, the circumstances in
which a shareholder may bring a derivative suit, and
isn't really answered by the Federal rules. And in
Cohen in particular, what the Court focused on --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You could say just as
well here that the question isn't addressed by the
Federal rules. If New York wants to say this kind of
claim can be brought only as an individual action, not
as a class action, why shouldn't the Federal
court say that's perfectly fine; this class of cases
can't be brought as a class action; we respect the
State's position on that. Why should we as a Federal
court in a diversity case create a claim that the –-
that the State never created?
MR. NELSON: Well, the reason is that Rule
actually does address the issue, and it's the same
issue that the -- that the State rule tries to address,
which is whether the matters may be certified as a
class.
Not only does Rule 23(b) provide explicitly
that the court may certify an action if the Rule 23(b)
(1), (2), or (3) criteria are met, but this Court also
emphasized in the Califano v. Yamasaki case that under
Rule 1, the Federal rules apply to all actions in the
Federal courts. And what that means, as the Court put
it in Yamasaki, is that a class action is available,
potentially, if the 23 standards are satisfied, in any
action within the Federal courts, unless Congress has
exercised its power to override a Federal rule, which,
as the author of Federal law, Congress is always
empowered to do.
The difference as to -- as to the State is
that the State has no power to displace Federal law, and
Rule 23, promulgated under the Rules Enabling Act, is
Federal law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: This Court in its recent
decisions has been sensitive to not overriding State
limitations, and so has read the Federal rule to avoid
the conflict.
Gasperini is one such case with regard to
Rule 59, interpreted so that you do not collide with the
State policy, and the same thing with Semtek with Rule
(b). The Federal rule is interpreted so as not to
conflict with the State policy.
MR. NELSON: Well, I would -- I would
actually first go back to what the Court said in Walker,
and I don't think it's -- Walker v. Armco, and I don't
think it's disavowed that that the Federal rule is given
its plain meaning, and when a collision is unavoidable,
the Court -- the Court recognizes conflict.
Gasperini, I think, is -- is different, with
due respect to someone who probably knows more about it
than I do. But as I read Gasperini at least, I see the
Court there saying that what is going to be applied in
the Federal court is what it saw as a substantive
standard limiting damages. That is to say, damages are
excessive if they are in excess of -- manifestly exceed
what is –-
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there wasn't a cap on
damages in Gasperini. It wasn't a cap. It was --
MR. NELSON: It wasn't -- excuse me. I'm
sorry. Go ahead.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was that we want the
courts to exercise a role in checking these damages so
they won't be excessive.
MR. NELSON: Well, the -- the Court in
Gasperini said what it saw was a substantive principle
of New York law, was that damages could not exceed
reasonable compensation for the -- for the plaintiff's
injuries. Now, that -- that is not a cap in the sense
of $1 million, $5 million, $50,000. But it's a cap in
the sense of providing the substantive standard by which
the court determines excessiveness.
And as for Rule 59, the reason the Court saw
no conflict there is Rule 59 simply provides the
procedural mechanism within which a defendant makes a
motion to seek a new trial on the grounds of
excessiveness of damages.
But it -- but excessiveness of damages is,
to go back to a point that was made in the previous
argument, like fairness. Fairness in relation to what?
Excessiveness of damages has to be judged according to
what the State law is on what damages one is entitled to
recover.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under -- under your
theory, are all of the statutes set forth by the
Respondents in their appendices invalid in Federal
court?
MR. NELSON: No, Your Honor, certainly not.
Especially given that their appendix -- half of it
consists of Federal statutes, which of course are valid
because Congress -- Congress can --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, not half.
MR. NELSON: Well, a significant number. I
-- I think it's -- it's a goodly number.
Now, as to the State statutes, I think the
State statutes are very different. Some of them may or
may not be valid, but they operate very differently from
the State statute at issue here.
They focus on particular rights of action.
Some of them set forth limits on recovery that really
are set forth as damages caps, and all of them are tied
specifically to the substantive cause of action created
by State law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So suppose in this case
the New York legislature, instead of having a statute
that covered penalties generally, minimum recoveries
generally, wrote into each statute, each penalty
statute, each minimal recovery statute, that this suit
must -- may not be brought as a class action -- instead
of having an encompassing statute that covered all of
them, wrote into each individual statute that
limitation.
MR. NELSON: I would agree that that
presents a very different question. I’m not -- I’m
still not certain that I -- that I think that the State
court can do that, because I don't think that a
limitation on whether an action can be brought as a
class establishes substantive rights within the meaning
of the Rules Enabling Act.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you -- are you telling
me that even if New York had provided for a specific
penalty for a specific matter, the Federal court could
disregard that and make it a class action, even if the
State that created the right said, this is a right for
an individual only?
MR. NELSON: Well, I -- again, I think
that's what the best answer to that question would be,
because the -- the right in a class action is still an
individual right; it's simply the -- the question is
simply whether multiple claims of multiple parties can
be aggregated in a single action. That doesn't expand
the right that the -- that the State legislature has
created for the individual.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that even
if it -- then you are telling me it doesn't make any
difference whether they do it across the board, as they
did here, or in each penalty statute it says no class
action.
MR. NELSON: Again, what I'm saying is it
certainly may make a difference in the sense that the
Court doesn't have to go nearly that far to resolve this
case.
If that case were presented, I'm simply
saying that -- that I still don't think that that
necessarily establishes a substantive right within the
meaning of the Rules Enabling Act.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, does it or not? I
mean, it presented you -- here's a case that says: You
can sue for this penalty but only in an individual
action.
MR. NELSON: Yes. As I've said, I think the
best answer to that question is: That does not
establish a substantive right. It establishes a
procedural right with respect to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you are saying that
even if New York didn't use this shorthand, even if they
incorporated it into each penalty statute, your answer
would be the same --
MR. NELSON: Yes, my answer would be the
same, but this -- the result here doesn't turn on that
answer being correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.
Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical was you are entitled to
$100 as a statutory penalty but only if it's an
individual claim. If you -- if this is brought as a
class action, you don't get the statutory penalty. I
thought that was the substance of her question.
Now, are you saying that also is merely
procedural and -- and pre-empted by Rule 23?
MR. NELSON: I think -- I think it's
procedural in the sense that it establishes -- if it
establishes a right, the right it establishes is
procedural and procedural rights don't override the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you get $100 or
you don't get $100. How can you be any less substantive
than getting the $100 or not getting the $100?
MR. NELSON: Whether you -- when – when
what determines whether you get it is the form of the
action that you have brought in a Federal court and
whether it has been brought aggregated with other --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then under your view,
there is absolutely nothing, no law that the State could
pass that would not conflict with Rule 23 --
MR. NELSON: No.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- as it -- as with
respect to class actions?
MR. NELSON: I mean, one thing that the
Court could do is that it could establish a cap that
applied with respect to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You mean the State could
MR. NELSON: I'm sorry, yes. I misspoke.
The State could certainly establish a cap that applied
whether an action was brought as a class action or an
individual action. In other words, for any related
series of transactions, the overall damages to which
this defendant can be subjected, whether in a
multiplicity of individual actions or in a class action
is X. That, I think, would clearly be substantive.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it has to
apply to individual actions as well?
MR. NELSON: I think -- I think if -- if the
application of the -- of the statute depends on
whether -- whether the action is brought as a Rule 23
action in Federal court or not, to me that's -- that is
placing consequences on a procedural issue, and is not a
matter of substance.
But, again, I want to emphasize that this
statute is very different from that. This statute is a
statute that is not even limited to rights of action
under New York State law. This is an action that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Have they applied it?
If I recall your brief correctly, you say that the New
York courts have applied it to causes of action arising
under other State laws. Is that right?
MR. NELSON: I -- I actually haven't found
one that applies it to actions arising under other State
laws. I have -- I found actions that apply it to
actions arising under Federal law. And the principal one
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no New York
Court of Appeals decision to that effect?
MR. NELSON: That is correct. They are
rules -- there are decisions of the appellant division.
But, as you know this Court very shortly after deciding
Erie emphasized, holdings of intermediate State court of
appeals are very persuasive data as to what State law
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It depends upon the
persuasiveness of the reasoning of the court.
MR. NELSON: Yes. And in this case, the
statute on its face uses the term "right of an action
brought under a statute." There is no suggestion in
1(b) that it's limited to New York State statutes.
The term "statute" in the -- in the Civil Practice Law
and Rules is not confined to New York State statutes.
Section 901 as a whole clearly is applicable
to -- to rights of action brought under any source of
law. And the New York State courts in the -- the most
applicable case, the Rudgayzer case, justified its
application of the statute to a Federal right of action
on the ground that this was merely an -- a -- a rule
that governed local forms of -- of proceeding.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can’t a statute be both?
Can a statute both establish a substantive limitation
and also establish a rule of procedure for New York
courts? Why can't a statute say, New York courts will
not entertain any action, including those arising under
foreign law, that are class actions seeking penalties?
And also, no New York State cause of action which seeks
a penalty can be sued on in a -- in a collaborative
action? Couldn't you do both in the same?
MR. NELSON: Well, a statute certainly
phrased that way could do both. The question is when
the statute is not phrased that way, when it's phrased
simply as a general procedural instruction as part of
the general procedural --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are begging the
question. It's a general instruction. But can't --
can't the instruction be interpreted to be both?
MR. NELSON: Well, the -- the question I
think is -- is what basis would there be for construing
it to be both? It -- it -- it's unitary in language --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the statute may
put forth both a substantive policy and a procedural
policy. I'll give you a concrete example.
New York establishes a claim and says in the
statute: But this sort of claim has to be brought
within 1 year. Then New York gets a similar claim
under another State's law, and it says, even though we
applied our -- even though our statute applies to our
own law in a substantive way -- that is, it says you
have no action after a certain amount of time –- we
don't want our courts to be cluttered with claims from
out of State when we wouldn't entertain similar claims
in our own State.
That is certainly the way statutes of
limitations have been interpreted by a number of States
as having both a procedural aspect and a substantive
aspect.
MR. NELSON: Well, I -- I certainly agree
that statutes of limitations are generally applied by
State courts to foreign causes of action. And that's
because, I think, for choice of law purposes, they are
considered and were traditionally considered to be
procedural matters. It's only with the advent of Erie
that they were characterized as substantive matters for
purposes of -- of the application of -- of the
doctrine.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that is not
altogether true, because there was always recognition
that a so-called built-in statute of limitations was
substantive.
MR. NELSON: If -- if the right of action
itself is delimited, as opposed to a statute of
limitation which, you know, cuts off your ability to
sue but supposedly doesn't cut off the underlying
right, yes, I think that's right. But, again, that goes
to -- to the fact that, you know, it does make a
difference whether a legislature chooses to establish a
rule as a general procedural matter or whether it makes
it integral to the -- to the definition of the right.
And as this Court said in the -- in the Byrd
case, that when looking at -- at State law -- and there
the question was whether an issue was an issue for the
jury. But in determining whether it would be considered
to be substantive or procedural, the question is whether
it is so bound up with the definition of the rights and
obligations under State law that it will be deemed to be
part of the substance of the law or whether it simply
relates to a mode of enforcing the right. And -- and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Byrd turned on
the characteristics of a Federal court and that is the
judge/jury relationship.
MR. NELSON: Well, Byrd -- Byrd turns in
part on that, but it also turns on -- on the Court's
view that -- that that issue, whether a case -- an issue
is decided by -- by jury or judge, is -- is one that is
not substantive under the Erie doctrine. So -- so there
are two aspects, I think, to what the Court is doing in
Byrd. But one of them --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it wouldn't matter
what the answer to that was, with the Seventh Amendment
looming over that case.
MR. NELSON: Well, you know, the Court
didn't decide it as a Seventh Amendment issue, and --
and because that particular question, I think, was --
was a question that arose out of a State law
administrative scheme, I think it's controversial
whether it -- whether the Seventh Amendment would apply,
and the Court, I think, advisedly decided that as an
Erie case rather than as a Seventh Amendment case.
I want to also --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you one brief
hypothetical?
MR. NELSON: Sure.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing this statute,
instead of being as broad as it is, said any statute
imposing penalties against insurance companies may not
be brought as a class action, any claims brought under
that statute?
MR. NELSON: Justice Stevens, I think the
outcome there would more clearly be the same, because,
again, it would not be -- it would not be part of the --
of the New York State law definition of the right to
insurance --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you said that if
it puts a ceiling on it, that would be -- that would be
substantive rather than procedural.
MR. NELSON: Well, if -- if -- if the Court
put a ceiling on rights of action under its own law --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.
MR. NELSON: -- its own State laws, that I
think becomes a substantive matter. The statute that I
think you've -- you've hypothesized here is one that is
based on the characteristics of the defendant regardless
of the source of law under which it's being sued.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you can make it a
claim brought under the insurance code, instead of
against insurance companies.
MR. NELSON: Yes. Well, that then, I think,
becomes very similar to the -- the hypothetical statutes
that Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor were positing, and
I acknowledge that that is -- that that is a much harder
question.
But, again, I think, ultimately, if the –-
if the issue addressed by the statute is, shall claims
of individuals be aggregated and adjudicated as part of
one unit, that is a substantive matter -- or a
procedural matter and is governed in the Federal courts
by a Federal procedural standard.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the basis
for the restriction is the additional administrative
costs of a class action? In other words, it doesn't
say you can't bring it, but it says any recovery shall
be reduced by 10 percent because class actions cost more
than individual actions?
MR. NELSON: Well, there -- that I think
would be a statute that is serving a manifestly
procedural interest, and if the Federal courts have not
chosen in their rules to impose an administrative charge
on class actions, a State law that purported to do so
would -- would not -- not have any application to
Federal procedure.
That -- that statute I think would be not
only foreclosed in its operation by the Rules Enabling
Act and Hanna v. Plumer, but would just be, on its face,
something that, even leaving aside the Federal rules,
would fall on the procedural side of the line in just
classic Erie terms because the policies that it reflects
are manifestly procedural.
And I think, actually, the same is true
here. A statute --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How is it different from
security for costs? I mean, that's what I started with.
That's -- there's nothing in the Federal rules that
say security for costs.
MR. NELSON: Well, the -- the -- as I
understand the Court's reasoning in Cohen, the security
was -- was not just for the cost of the action, but for
the plaintiff’s liability to the corporation that was
created under State law in the case of an unsuccessful
derivative action.
And that liability was what the Court looked
at in Cohen as -- as making -- making the fundamental
issue substantive, and the bond was sort of the -- you
know, the tail on the dog, in the sense that the Court
characterized it as substantive, having first
characterized the damages remedy as substantive because
without the bond, according to the majority, the remedy
would be meaningless.
I -- you know, the proposition was certainly
debatable -- even Justice --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Without the bond, the
remedy would be -- I don't -- this is a plaintiff
that had to put up security for costs.
MR. NELSON: Right, and -- but -- but the
remedy I'm referring to is the defendant's right to
recover damages from the plaintiff under State law if a
derivative action was unsuccessful. And it was securing
that remedy that the -- that the Court saw the bond to
be critical to, which was not only why it -- it treated
it as substantive, but also granted an interlocutory
appeal because, if -- if the bond wasn't there, the
right to recover from this plaintiff would be -- would
be meaningless.
That was -- that was, as I understand it,
the Court's reasoning.
If the -- if the Court has no further
questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my
time, please.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Landau.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LANDAU: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
As some of Justice Ginsburg's initial
questions point out, this case falls within the
heartland of Erie because allowing plaintiffs to recover
State law penalties in Federal court that they can't
recover in State court on a State law cause of action
would powerfully distort ex ante forum choices, which is
precisely what the Erie doctrine seeks to avoid.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't Rule 23 a
judgment by Congress that class actions that meet the
criteria of Rule 23 are fair and efficient, correct?
That's Congress's judgment?
MR. LANDAU: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your theory, any
State could pass a law that says no cause of action
under State law can be brought as a class action ever.
That would be your theory because it's substantive, if
it's an Erie choice.
MR. LANDAU: Two points, Your Honor. First,
of course, Rule 23 is not enacted by Congress. That's
one of the important points here, that it comes out of
this Court.
It's delegated authority under the Rules
Enabling Act to set forth these rules, so there is
always a limitation on what a rule of procedure can do.
That's why there is an advisory committee that sets it.
It's not a statute, and there are -- there are
restrictions on -- on the rules that don't apply to
Congress.
But going to the substance of your question,
Your Honor, Rule 23 governs the criteria for when --
when you can have a class, but it doesn't address the
underlying question, which is: Can you have a class in
the first place?
Is there -- the legislature that creates the
cause of action can say, this is categorically
ineligible for class certification.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't quite
answered my question.
MR. LANDAU: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your State can come in
and say, no State cause of action will ever be subject
to class treatment. And you would say there is no
conflict between that and Rule 23?
MR. LANDAU: Well, Your Honor, if the State
is talking about its own State law causes of action, the
State is the master. The State creates these causes of
action in the first place. If a State, like New York
did here, says certain causes of action –-
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. No State cause of
action can be brought as a class. You're saying there
is no conflict with Rule 23's judgment about efficiency
of Federal court litigation?
MR. LANDAU: Well, Your Honor, it could be,
if a State said that no State cause of action could be
brought as a class action, that that -- you have to look
at what the State was doing in making that rule.
If the State --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just what it's doing
here. There are some things -- we make a policy choice,
the State, that, contrary to Rule 23, that there are
some causes of action that are not fairly and
efficiently brought as a class.
That's what the State has said as a policy
choice, correct?
MR. LANDAU: Well, Your Honor, no, because
the policy choice here is a substantive policy choice to
limit penalties from being distorted in a class action
case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's a policy choice.
MR. LANDAU: Well, if the -- if the State,
Your Honor, makes a policy choice, it is a substantive
policy choice, as I believe -- your hypothetical, at
some points, was talking about what sounded like a
substantive policy choice.
If it makes a procedural policy choice, as,
in a sense, Mississippi has done and Virginia, by simply
not having class actions at all -- they don't have that
-- well, then that doesn't raise an issue under the
Rules of Decision Act because it's not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you have answered my
question. Under your view, a State could say, no class
actions.
MR. LANDAU: A State --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And -- and a Federal
court, sitting in diversity, could never aggregate those
claims, those State law claims?
MR. LANDAU: For State law claims, yes. If
it makes a substantive decision that we want -- a State
could abolish that cause of action altogether, Your
Honor. And I think the concern that Your Honor is
expressing is somehow that Federal courts could be
flooded with State law causes of action. Well, that
won't happen because they would still have to meet
Federal jurisdictional norms to get into Federal court.
So you won't get small State law claims.
You would still have to meet the requirements for
Federal jurisdiction.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do I –- do
I understand your response to turn on -- let's say the
State, for example, limits class actions because it
doesn't want vast exposure under the penalty provisions
that you could get in a class action. It only wants to
pay when they can be brought on an individual basis.
But they may also limit class actions by saying, as
Justice Sotomayor suggested, that they are not fair and
efficient. Do you get one result in the former case and
a different result in the latter?
MR. LANDAU: Well, the Erie -- you could,
Your Honor. The answer -- the short answer is "yes",
because the Erie cases have looked to the purpose.
I think Justice --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you -- how do
you tell?
MR. LANDAU: Well, Your Honor, it's not
always easy.
Erie cases, for that reason, are not
always -- result in easy line-drawing. Certainly, in
making the Erie choice, this Court has looked to the
State's purpose.
Here, in this case, it happens to be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it's
pertinent, then, whether they do it, as I think you
were -- was discussed earlier, on an across-the-board
basis or on an individual basis?
MR. LANDAU: I think that's something that
one could look at, as part of determining how -- what is
the design and operation in State court.
And on that point, I'll say the other side
does try to make it seem like it is absolutely
dispositive that this is being applied more broadly than
New York State law causes of action.
There is two responses. First, they really
haven't proven that. The only case they have that
actually has applied it to anything other than a New
York cause of action is the Rudgayzer case under the
Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which is a very
unique Federal statute that specifically incorporates
State law. It looks to State law. And the Rudgayzer
court didn't come in and say, this is broadly applicable
to a Federal cause of action. It relied on that very
language.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, how can you say
that? The case itself says: We read the language of
the statute; Congress didn't say this was to be a class
action; we are not permitting it. I understand the
difference, and it could have argued or analyzed the
case the way you said, but the appellate division there
did exactly what your adversary said it did.
MR. LANDAU: We are -- we disagree –- I
mean, what the court did in Rudgayzer -- they did not
say, this applies broadly to all New York -- to all
Federal causes of action. It looked at the TCPA and
said the TCPA is a special statute that refers to the
law of the State. It's an unusual statute. So again, I
think the Rudgayzer case, if you look at the analysis,
it supports us.
But even more broadly, Your Honor, I think
the key point is what they are trying to get at somehow
by -- by saying that this applies broadly is to say that
New York would treat this as procedural. And they are
-- they are asking this Court essentially to speculate
on that. But there is no need to speculate because the
New York Court of Appeals 2 years ago addressed this
statute in quite some detail in the Sperry case, and the
New York Court of Appeals actually went through why the
statute was adopted, why 901(b) was adopted. And the
New York Court of Appeals specifically said it was a
response. The word -- it said, you know, when -- when
New York modernized its class action statute regime in
75, there was concern expressed among a lot of people
that applying penalties on a class-wide basis, statutory
penalties and minimum measures of recovery unrelated to
any actual damages, would be distorted and there would
be overdeterrence and overkill in the class action
context.
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose the reason --
suppose the reason that they did that -- suppose they
are very honest about their reasons, and they say, we
think class actions are very often a very good thing,
because a lot of people who are hurt can get some
recovery and it acts as a deterrent. But there is some
bad things about them. And one of the bad things is,
somebody files a lawsuit, and before you know it, the
litigation expenses are so high that the company feels
it has to settle. Now, in our view that latter factor
predominates. And that means that these procedures,
class actions, will sometimes -- too often -- lead to
the unjust, inefficient settlement of disputes. And
that's why we are doing it.
MR. LANDAU: I think that's exactly what
they did here, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right, if that's
exactly what we did, why isn't that second-guessing the
judgment of the rule that they are saying it
is efficient -- an inefficient procedure. It is
inefficient in terms of the object of -- of the Federal
rules and what the class wanted. We want efficient
methods of achieving justice.
MR. LANDAU: I'm sorry, to the extent -- the
hypothetical I thought you were saying, they were
recognizing that it would be overdeterrence --
JUSTICE BREYER: Overdeterrence because they
feel that the class action procedure is one that leads
to forcing companies to settle, and to that extent the
class action procedure does not lead to the efficient
determination of disputes but to the inefficient and
unjust determination. That's their honest reason.
MR. LANDAU: Right, Your Honor. I think
what -- what I hear them saying in your hypothetical is
not really the operation of judicial process. It
doesn't go to the criteria.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, it does. It says
it’s the judicial process that does it.
MR. LANDAU: Well, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER: It's the judicial process
and its expanse --
MR. LANDAU: I think --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- that forces the
settlements that create unjust results.
MR. LANDAU: Right, but I think there they
are looking at the unjust results. As I hear your
hypothetical, you're saying –-
JUSTICE BREYER: That may be, and suppose
they said, you know, a 30-day period for appeal creates
unjust results in our opinion, and therefore we think it
is more efficient to have a 90-day appeal period. That
wouldn't last for 2 seconds, wouldn't it?
MR. LANDAU: No, because then you would --
JUSTICE BREYER: So how is this different?
MR. LANDAU: Because then you would have
a clear Hanna problem, Your Honor. I think -- let's go
back to the threshold question. They try to get around
what is a clear forum distortion, a clear Erie problem
by saying you don't even get to Erie because you have a
threshold Hanna issue, which is Rule 23 answers this
question.
I didn't hear any real analysis from the
other side of what is it in Rule 23 that actually says
that you must be able to certify a class in every single
cause of action that comes before you, even if the very
legislature that created the cause of action says you
may not have a class?
In fact, I think the Chief Justice earlier
asked how this case differs from the statutes in
appendices A and B. And I think I really didn't really
hear a very clear answer. The statutes in Appendix A
are all statutes where States and the Federal Government
have put caps on the recovery in class actions. That
shows that you can have a substantive cap on what is a
procedural device.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, well, let me be -- I
just say I want -- I want to be sure I understood your
answer to Justice Sotomayor. Is it your position that,
if we follow your view in this case, it would also be
true that -- if New York had passed a statute saying no
cause of action based on New York law may be maintained
as a class action?
MR. LANDAU: Yes, Your Honor. If New York
did that -- I guess my answer is -- you really would
have to look behind that. If it simply said -- if
Mississippi and Virginia codified their current
nonexistence of -- nonauthorization of class actions
under State law and affirmatively said that there may
not be a class action --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And that would -- that
would apply not only to statutory causes of action but
causes of action based on New York common law.
MR. LANDAU: Right. Under -- under New York
law. If they were making decisions, they having created
these causes of action under their own State's law, if
they think it would be overdeterrent to have these kinds
of actions brought on a class-wide basis and they were
really enacting this for purposes of limiting the
remedies that were available for these causes of action
that they created, I -- there would be a strong argument
that that should apply under --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I guess --
MR. LANDAU: -- under Erie.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but
wouldn't Justice Stevens's hypothetical suggest that
they were less concerned about the impact of -- of the
class action procedure than they were about its
procedural efficiency? In other words, I understand
your position if you're saying, look, we've only got $20
million in this fund to pay plaintiffs and we think it's
better to go on an individual basis, because if it's a
class action, you know, it would be over in one shot or
whatever --
MR. LANDAU: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but it's not
appropriate to say, we don't like the class action
procedure as a general matter.
MR. LANDAU: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in Justice
Stevens's hypothetical, it applied across the board,
which would cause me, anyway, to think it was the
latter.
MR. LANDAU: I would agree with Your Honor.
If you have an unadorned prohibition on class actions in
the State -- from a State, I think the most natural
understanding of that is that was their determination of
how the procedures in their courts are going to work.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be one or the
other, though. You -- you -- is it your position that
if this is substantive, as you contend, it cannot be
procedural? So New York State could not apply this --
this rule to out-of-State causes of action, and if it
did, you -- you ought to have lost this case.
MR. LANDAU: No, Your Honor -- again, I
think they can blend. I think in Gasperini this Court
pointed out that the -- the heightened standard of
judicial review of damages awards had a manifestly -- it
was a procedural command with a manifestly substantive
purpose. I think this case is not really dissimilar.
Instead -- the cases in Appendix A say that in a
class -- excuse me, the statutes say in a class action
you may not recover more than X. The only difference
here is it says, if you are seeking to recover more than
X, you may not have a class action.
And with respect to the statutes in Appendix
B, those say there may not be a class action for
particular causes of action. I don’t --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: New York doesn't have --
as the -- the question that Justice Sotomayor asked and
that Justice Stevens asked -- doesn't have any
anti-class action as a procedural policy. It has picked
out a particular kind of action, one for a penalty, one
where there’s -- what is it -- minimum recovery, and
said that category, we have -- we're not anti-class
action in general, but these penalties that we created,
we don't want those brought as class actions.
MR. LANDAU: Precisely, Your Honor. And I
think that underscores is why this is substantive or the
fact that this reflects a substantive policy decision.
It is not about the efficiency or operation of the
class action process itself, the judicial process. This
is a substantive decision to calibrate the remedy that
New York has afforded under its own law, and a decision
that when you have penalties that New York has decided
-- and the Sperry case is very explicit on this -- that
New York made a decision that the -- the appropriate
level of enforcement for those was the level in an
individual action, and that when you got -- when you
tried to make it into a class, that that would be
overenforcement of those. And --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: One -- one question that
was raised by the other side is, well, if you're saying
this kind of restriction -- restriction on class action
-- applies in a diversity case, why not a State that
says we love class actions and we want class actions to
be -- not to be hemmed in by all of the Rule 23
requirements?
MR. LANDAU: Then, Your Honor, you would
have a Hanna issue because Rule 23 does set forth the
criteria for a Federal court to certify a class.
State law cannot change or water down those
criteria or direct that you get to the goal line of a
certified class by some mechanism other than the Rule 23
criteria.
Our position, Your Honor, our point is that
you don't get to the Rule 23 criteria if the State law
or the substantive law that creates the cause of action
sends you off the highway before you get into the land
of the criteria.
If it just says, this is categorically
unavailable as a class, as many States have, in fact,
done in the statutes in Appendix B -- they have come up
with novel causes of action sometimes, abusive e-mail
cause of action.
And they said, well, we do not want a class
action to be brought for this kind of claim. That is a
decision that reflects a substantive choice by the
legislature that it would be overdeterrence and
overenforcement to have this brought on a class-wide
basis.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it -- it only
reflects a substantive choice -- if it is a substantive
choice. If they say, we are not going to allow class
actions because we think, procedurally, they are a bad
idea because we think lawyers get too much recovery when
they recover -- in other words, it -- your -- your
position depends upon a characterization of the ban, and
the restriction on class actions is either substantive
or procedural.
MR. LANDAU: Well, Your Honor, I think what
you can -- you can assume that, if they are not changing
their criteria and not changing the rules governing all
class actions, but singling out particular causes of
action or particular penalties, that it's done for a
substantive reason.
Here, in New York, we actually know that's
true because the Sperry court says that. And one, I
think, important point in 901(b) is the initial clause,
the “unless” clause, that we have been focusing a lot on
the last clause that says it may not be brought as a --
as a class action, if it's seeking a statutory penalty.
But it says, "unless a statute creating or
imposing a penalty or minimum measure of recovery
specifically authorizes the recovery thereof in a class
action."
That's showing, that even though this is
located in the CPLR, that it's really part and parcel of
their statutory regime. It's saying, this is our
statutory default rule.
To be sure, a New York statute can override
that, but the idea that this is somehow simply
procedural because it's in the CPLR is really belied by
that language that -- that really shows that -- and,
frankly, I think it also belies the fact that this
applies to causes of action outside of New York because
the “unless” clause really can only be understood as
setting a default baseline for the New York legislature
in enacting a statute, that they may want to
specifically authorize class actions for penalties.
So, again, I think --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just be sure I am
not lost on one point. Does this just apply to
statutory cause of action created by New York law? Or
does it apply to a statutory cause of action created by
New Mexico law?
MR. LANDAU: New York law, Your Honor.
There's nothing --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The language doesn't limit
it that way, does it?
MR. LANDAU: You are right, Your Honor, but,
again, you read language against certain background
assumptions and norms that States when they’re --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, let me ask you this
question: Supposing it did apply to statutory cause of
actions created by New Mexico law?
MR. LANDAU: You know, and the truth is,
Your Honor, I think it still wouldn't matter at the end
of the day. I think, in Gasperini, the law -- the
provision of the CPLR in Gasperini provided for
heightened review.
There was no indication that that applied
only to New York causes of action. Again, it may be one
clue, but it's not dispositive.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it seems to me that
your position basically is that New York can decide what
kinds of cases shall be brought as class actions,
period.
MR. LANDAU: Well, Your Honor, if New York
decides, for substantive reasons -- and we are talking
about New York causes of action --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, whatever the
reason --
MR. LANDAU: Okay.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- for some good reason.
MR. LANDAU: Right. Well -- well,
New York -- yes, that New York can make a decision
that it doesn't want certain New York causes of action
to be brought as class actions, and the Federal courts
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the question is
New Mexico causes of action. Can they decide that they
don't want actions from outside of the State to be
brought as class actions?
MR. LANDAU: Well, Your Honor, I think that
would raise some interesting questions about New York's
power to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What it would do, it
seems to me, is make it clear that was not a
substantive decision, but, instead, a procedural
decision.
MR. LANDAU: Correct, Your Honor. That's
right. And, again -- and, again --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it could be -- it
could be, as I -- the example of the statute of
limitations. We create a claim. It has a certain life.
It's dead after that time. That's New York law.
A sister State may say, we create the same
claim, but we think it has a longer life. New York
would say, that's fine. Bring that claim in your own
State. Don't clutter up our courts with out-of-State
claims when we would not hear the identical claim under
our own law.
There are policies that do operate as
procedural limitations and have a substantive thrust.
MR. LANDAU: Absolutely.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: New York might well say,
look, we don't hear in New York penalty cases, and so we
are not going to entertain the sister State claim for
any -- when we wouldn't entertain our own. We are not
frustrating the sister State. They could bring the
class action there, but not in -- not in our courts.
MR. LANDAU: And I think the point -- I
agree 100 percent. I think the point that you are --
that point underscores, Your Honor, is that, ultimately,
the Erie issue is a Federal issue.
You can look to New York to try to
understand the design and operation of the State rule at
issue, but, ultimately, you are being asked, as a
Federal court, to set the appropriate relationship
between the State court system and the Federal court
system.
And, again, the lesson of Erie is you don't
want to create incentives that will bring people like a
magnet to Federal court and distort these ex ante
foreign choices of litigants for State law claims.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they -- they bring
up the Class Action Fairness Act, which allows a
plaintiff -- they allow a defendant to remove a
class action from a State court to a Federal court, but
they also allow a plaintiff to initiate an action in the
Federal court.
MR. LANDAU: That's correct, Your Honor, but
the Class Action Fairness Act, on its face -- and the
legislative history actually makes this point explicit
-- it had no intention to change the operation of the
Erie doctrine in class actions.
And so there is nothing in the Class Action
Fairness Act that changes the scope of Rule 23. Again,
Rule 23 just doesn't address this antecedent issue. It
assumes, but does not require, that you have a cause of
action that is amenable to class certification in the
first place.
And if you were to construe Rule 23
otherwise, as overriding this kind of statute -- all the
statutes in Appendix B, that would be a truly remarkably
substantive interpretation that this Court has always
stressed, that it must, in construing the rules, be
careful not to tread into that territory and has
construed the rules with an eye towards the limitations
of the Rules Enabling Act.
The other side -- Shady Grove would walk you
right into an extremely problematic situation from the
point of view of the Rules Enabling Act, as well as
creating these -- these incentives that really go
against the heart of the Erie doctrine that would turn a
$500 case into a $5 million case.
And one interesting point, I think, is that
all these statutes that are listed in our Appendix B
that limit class certification for particular causes of
action -- under their theory that Rule 23 requires that
everything be amenable to class certification, those
would all be out the window.
I don't think counsel really wanted to admit
that this morning, but the logic of their theory that –-
is that Rule 23 governs this case and Rule 23 requires
that every cause of action that comes before it be
eligible for class certification.
That would knock out each and every one of
the statutes in Appendix B. They don't live up to -- in
their reply brief, at footnote 10, on page 15, they try
to distinguish those statutes by saying, ah, well, the
limitation on class actions in those statutes is in the
substantive cause of action.
It's not in -- it's not somewhere else in
the code, but that doesn't -- that doesn't save their
argument under Rule 23. They really can't square that
with their -- their core position that Rule 23 itself
answers the question presented in this case.
And, again, what we would ask the Court is
just to -- is to recognize that Rule 23 occupies the
ground it occupies, but it doesn't go -- it occupies the
ground of the criteria, which go to the efficiency and
fairness of the process.
But where a State has made an antecedent
decision that -- that a particular cause of action or
a particular remedy is categorically unavailable -- or
ineligible for class certification, that's a decision
that Federal courts should respect under the Erie
doctrine.
If there are no further questions, I see my
time is about to expire.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Landau.
MR. LANDAU: Thank you, Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Nelson, you have
minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NELSON: Thank you.
I would like to begin with the point that my
friend made about the "unless" clause in 901(b) and that
that somehow indicated that it applied only to New York
State statutes. In fact, the New York courts have
applied that "unless" clause to Federal statutes,
holding in one case that the Truth in Lending Act
satisfied the "unless" clause because it authorized a
class action, and in another that the Telephone Consumer
Protection Act did not because it didn't authorize a
class action.
So it actually is, I think, quite clear from
the language of the statute and from the Court's
application --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- when you are
dealing with a Federal statute, there’s a -- there’s a
factor that doesn't come up when you are dealing with
sister States, and that is the Supremacy Clause.
If Congress has made a judgment -- let's say
83 -- I don't think the State that says, for our
comparable claims, we don't allow class action could --
could apply that --
MR. NELSON: I think that's right. If
Congress had provided that a class action was authorized
in any court under a statute, New York couldn't prevent
But my point here is that the "unless"
clause is simply consistent with the rest of the
statute, which makes clear that it applies to statutes
from any source.
And that means that far from being in the
heartland of Erie, this is far outside the heartland of
Erie. It's a case where the State court for procedural
-- or the State's legislature, for procedural reasons, a
balancing of the fairness and efficiency, the –- of
class actions and those things that must -- that are
requisite to the just, speedy, and efficient --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I can't see how that's so
when they limit just a particular remedy or penalty. If
they were saying, well, across the board we don't want
class actions, I could follow your argument much better.
But when New York singles out penalties, it seems to be
talking not about the efficiency and fairness of
proceedings, but that it doesn't want penalty claims to
be magnified.
MR. NELSON: Well, but that's an aspect of
-- of the fairness and efficiency of proceedings.
Remember, of course, these are not claims for which the
plaintiffs can't recover in State court. They are
simply claims that they have to proceed individually in
State court to pursue.
And the further point I would make is that
the judgment that the -- that the New York legislature
makes, that statutory penalties under any set of
statutes are not appropriate for class treatment, is
really contrary to the decision that the rules drafters
of Rule 23 have made, which actually specifies the
circumstances under which classes can be certified
exactly by reference to the type of relief sought.
So it's a case where the rule and the State
statute really do cover the same ground, to use the
approach this Court took in the Burlington case, where
it said that a State statute would not be given
effect when the Federal rule occupies the territory.
And that's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it didn't say that
about Rule 59, and it didn't say that about Rule 41(b).
MR. NELSON: And -- and Rule 59 doesn't
occupy the territory of the standard to be applied, and
Rule 41(b) as construed in Semtek just does not address
preclusive effect.
And finally, again, on the issue of ex ante
forum choice, Congress, in the Class Action Fairness
Act, provided jurisdiction so that Federal procedural
rules would apply. If, as my friend argues, whether or
not a case can proceed as a class action is a matter of
substantive right, that principle can't be cabined to
cases where the substantive -- or where the State
standard precludes class actions.
If a class action, yes or no, is a matter of
substantive right, that applies equally to State
standards that -- that would promote class actions, and
therefore, even though as -- as my friend says, it would
be a Hanna issue, there would be an abridgement of a
substantive right. So -- I see that my time is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your
thought, if you like.
MR. NELSON: Well, the thought is that
that's an indication that amenability to class actions
should be treated both for plaintiffs and for defendants
as a matter of procedural right governed by the Federal
rules. Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:55 a.m., the case in the
