Mr. Katyal.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The Federal Circuit applied a de novo
without-deference standard to objective baselessness in
Section 285 cases.  That was wrong for three reasons.
First, this Court has already held that a
unitary abuse-of-discretion standard should be applied
in closely analogous cases in the Pierce and Cooter
cases.  Those cases, like this one, were ancillary
appeals over attorneys' fees concerning the supervision
of litigation, which is precisely what Section 285
addresses.
Second, the text of the Act, and in
particular its key words, "may" and "exceptional
cases," imbued district courts with discretion.  Indeed,
up until this case, that was the way the Act applied for
60 years.
And, third, the other factors this Court has
looked to, such as a lack of law clarifying benefits,
the positioning of the decision-maker, efficiency in
avoiding distortion, cut in favor of unitary
abuse-of-discretion review.
For those reasons, the case for such review
even stronger here than it was in Pierce and Cooter.  In
Pierce and Cooter, this Court looked to -- for -- in
Pierce, for example, this Court looked to EAJA and
determined that, even though the text of the statute
didn't compel a result, nonetheless, unitary
abuse of discretion review was the appropriate standard.
And here --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How -- how does
abuse of discretion work with respect to a pure legal
question?
MR. KATYAL:  I think this Court answered
that both in Pierce and Cooter.  It said if it's a truly
pure legal question, then it is a -- that it is a --
that -- that there isn't deference given to that in that
circumstance.
Now, here the question presented is
objective baselessness.  And in the context of
Section 285 determinations, that kind of retrospective
look -- was the attorney acting reasonably or not --
Pierce and Cooter both say that's something that is
always context-dependent.  It always depends on the
facts.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, would you explain that
to me a little bit, Mr. Katyal.  In a case in which the
district court just uses an erroneous claim
construction, you would concede that that's a pure legal
question, so that would be an abuse of discretion?
MR. KATYAL:  We would not, Your Honor.  So
certainly on the merits, if the question of claim
construction went up to the Federal Circuit -- as it did
here, for example, in 2009 -- the question there would
be there would be no deference under the Federal
Circuit's precedent in a -- most recently, Friday in the
Lighting Ballast case.
But when the question is a 285 question, the
retrospective look at objective baselessness of which
claim construction forms a part --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but I -- I guess my
first question was just if what -- if the district court
says, Here's the appropriate claim construction, and
in saying that, it's wrong.
MR. KATYAL:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that a legal question?
MR. KATYAL:  As it goes up to the Federal
Circuit under existing precedent, they treat that as a
legal question.  We think this Court's decision in
Markman suggests otherwise.  It said it was a mixed
question, a mongrel question of law and fact.  And so
when -- if the Court were ever to get into that ultimate
question on the merits, we think that -- that the
Markman analysis would control.
But here the question is a 285 question.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So let's just assume
for a moment that an erroneous claim construction would
be a mistake of law.  Let's just assume that.  And I
understand you say that there's a question.
But if that's right, why is it not also true
that a judge's statement that a litigant -- that a
litigant's claim construction was unreasonable is not a
similar mistake of law?
MR. KATYAL:  For -- for exactly the reason
that I think Pierce says, which is the question in a
retrospective attorneys' fees case is not what the -- is
not what was the law; it's rather, was the position that
the party took reasonable.
And so, for example, in Pierce the question
was under a certain statute, EAJA, do the words "shall"
and "authorized" -- do they mean mandatory?  And Justice
White in dissent said that's a pure legal question.
That's something courts of appeals deal with all the
time, district courts don't deal with it; we should give
no deference to that.  And Justice Scalia's opinion for
the Court said, No, even there, that is something we're
looking at that legal claim as situated within the
particular contours of the case overall in deciding was
that a reasonable argument or not.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But isn't the main thing the
judge doing when it says that a claim construction is
unreasonable is essentially measuring the delta between
the actual -- the correct claim construction and the
mistaken claim construction?  And doesn't that seem to
be, again, assuming that the claim construction itself
is a question of law?  Doesn't that itself seem to be a
question of law?
MR. KATYAL:  We agree that's one of the
things the judge is doing there, but it's not the only
thing.  Just as in Pierce, certainly the Court was
interpreting the meaning of the statute, but they were
doing it within the context of litigation.  This case I
think is a helpful example and -- to remove it from the
abstract and just bring it down to here.
You've heard and you've read the brief on
the other side saying this is a claim construction
dispute.  It's not a claim construction dispute.  What
the district court found seven different times when it
imposed fees is that this is actually a dispute about
infringement and their inability to come up with any
theory whatsoever for why -- why there was a
infringement violation.
And what I think the logic of Pierce and
Cooter is, is that if you give clever appellate lawyers
like my friend the ability to go to the -- to go to a
court of appeals and repackage what were essentially
factual claims and claim they're legal -- here, claim
construction -- then you're going to -- you're going to
waste an enormous time of -- time and resources of the
Federal Circuit as they seek to disaggregate, is this
really, truly factual or is this really legal.
And you wouldn't want to have that, I think,
for the reasons that this Court has said repeatedly,
which is the whole goal in attorney fees cases is to
avoid a second major litigation.  And that's precisely
what the Federal Circuit did here.  It minted a whole
new theory under this de novo without-deference
standard.  And that's the harm.  That's the evil that I
think all of the attorney fees cases are trying to
address.
I'd also say that, you know, even if --
beyond Pierce, beyond Pierce, we do think this is
essentially Pierce-plus; that this is a case in which
the text of the statute and its key words, "may in
exceptional cases," give the Court, I think, further
reason to return the standard to the way it has always
been interpreted for 60 years.
And for 60 years:  From 1946 to 1952,
Abuse of discretion deferential review was used in
objective baselessness cases; in 1952, the -- the
Congress codified, essentially, those -- that
interpretation; from 1952 to 1982, the regional circuits
used it, like the D.C. Circuit in the Oetiker case;
after 1982, the Federal Circuit used it time and again
in cases such as Eon-Net.
It's this case that really is a dramatic
departure from the way Section 285 has been interpreted,
and indeed the way all attorney fee litigation has been
interpreted.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we undo --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  On your reading,
Mr. Katyal, I take it that if the district court denies
fees, there would be slim to no chance of getting that
overturned on appeal if you're dealing with the abuse
of -- abuse of discretion.
MR. KATYAL:  We think that it is hard in
that circumstance, and that's the one-way ratchet.  We
don't place a lot of emphasis on that in our brief.
It's our last argument.  But we do think, essentially,
it is hard to overturn a district court's decision not
to award fees, whereas under the Federal Circuit's
interpretation, it's really quite easy for the Federal
Circuit to mint some new theory as to why the position
was reasonable that -- that the attorney took.
And, Justice Breyer, you said in the last
argument, you said clever patent attorneys can always
come up with a colorable argument, and you were
referring at the district court stage --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if you leave it to the
district court that way and the district court denies
fees, isn't there a -- a risk of large disparities from
district judge to district judge.  One will say, yes, I
think that this was uncommon, not run of the mine, so
I'm going to award fees, and another one of them will
say, no, I think it's pretty standard, so I won't award
fees.
MR. KATYAL:  We do think implicit in an
abuse of discretion standard or Congress committing this
to district court discretion will be some variation.  We
think this Court answered that problem in Koon, I think
most particularly, in a case where the stakes were --
you know, not to belittle this case -- but the stakes
were even higher there, criminal sentencing.
And what the Court said is, yes, there will
be some disuniformity, but district court judges are
better able to determine the mine-run case than will the
court of appeals because they're able to assess the
entirety of the litigation, rather than -- than one
piece of it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Katyal, if we were
to overrule the Brooks Furniture standard -- you've just
heard the argument where that issue is being presented
to us in Octane.  If we were to do that, how would that
affect this case?  Wouldn't it essentially moot the
question because you wouldn't have this objective
reasonableness test controlling the outcome?
MR. KATYAL:  Well, it would certainly depend
on how -- on how you did it, but our brief at pages 34
to 37 say that if you adopt any variant of the
petitioner's theory in Octane, the case here only gets
stronger.
You have to, I think, ultimately reverse
what the Federal Circuit said at page 9a of the petition
appendix, which is objective baselessness must be
determined de novo.  We think that that's wrong for all
the reasons we've been talking about.  And even were you
to change the standard in Octane, so long as objective
baselessness formed any part of the Section 285
inquiry --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So when does that become
a pure question of law?
MR. KATYAL:  We think it never becomes a
pure question of law.  There -- there are -- we don't
doubt that -- to answer the Chief Justice's question
from before -- we don't doubt that there are some
circumstances in which there are pure questions of law
in Section 285 cases.  For example, what does the Patent
Act -- the Patent Clause in the Constitution mean, or
what does a particular statute mean?
But when you're dealing with, for example,
claim construction, that looks very much like the EAJA
question that the Court was dealing with in Justice
Scalia's opinion in Pierce.  It's a retrospective
collateral question about how reasonable was this
argument at this particular time, in this particular
case, with these particular parties, with this
particular patent.
And what Justice Scalia's opinion in Pierce
says is that's not the type of question that we should
be spending a lot of court of appeals' resources on.
That's something that is dealt with on the merits, as it
was here.  The Federal Circuit dealt with the question
on the merits in 2009 -- but not something that you
should have a second major litigation over.
If there are no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Fletcher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. FLETCHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In this morning's first case, you will
decide what principles should guide a district court's
award of attorneys' fees under Section 285.  Whatever
standard you choose to adopt in that case, we believe
that a district court's application to the particular
facts of a case before it ought to be reviewed under a
unitary abuse of discretion standard.
That approach is consistent with this
Court's repeated statements that decisions about the
supervision of litigation ought to be reviewed under a
deferential standard.  And in this particular context,
it's also supported by the text and history of
Section 285, by 60 years of consistent appellate
practice, and by the same sorts of practical
considerations that led this Court to adopt a similar
approach to very similar questions in Pierce and in
Cooter & Gell.
I'd like to start, if I could, by focusing
on a point that hasn't come up so far in the argument,
which is we've heard a lot about why district courts are
best situated to make the determination in a particular
case that they've lived with, often for years at a time,
of whether or not a particular litigating position is
unreasonable.  And we think that's true and a very good
reason to accord deference here.
But we think another good reason to accord
deference in this context is that applying de novo
review requires a substantial expenditure of appellate
resources.  I think this case is a good example.
The Federal Circuit affirmed the district
court's decision on the merits in an unpublished
decision and, in fact, without written opinion.  But
when it reviewed the district court's award of fees
under a de novo standard, it was required to engage in a
lengthy analysis that produced a lengthy written
opinion.  And we think applying a de novo standard and
requiring appellate courts, and the Federal Circuit in
particular, to engage in that kind of review encourages
collateral appeals and encourages the expenditure of
resources on decisions that don't actually produce the
law --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you can make -- you
can make that argument with respect to every legal issue
that's raised on appeal.  Well, if you have to decide
whether the lower court was right, that's a lot of work.
But if all you have to decide is whether the lower court
abused its discretion in deciding if the law means what
the lower court said it means, that's a lot less work.
MR. FLETCHER:  Well, that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So that argument is a
strange argument, unless there's something really
special about the attorneys' fees context.  And I guess
that's your argument, there's something really special.
But why should it?  I mean, you've got a lot
of money involved.  Why should we say, this is
collateral litigation, even though it involves millions
of dollars more than the claim in many other types of
cases?
MR. FLETCHER:  So let me say a couple of
things about that, and one is, I think ordinarily when
an appellate court applies a de novo standard and
determines what the right answer is, that has benefits
not just for the particular litigants before it, but
also in clarifying the law for everyone going forward.
But what the Court said in Pierce and in
Cooter & Gell and what's also true here is that when the
question that the appellate court is answering is not
what is the law actually, but rather what could a party,
when it initiated this case and continued to litigate it
several years ago, could that party have a -- reasonably
believed the law to be, that doesn't yield the same sort
of law-clarifying benefit.  In fact, in Pierce, this
Court said those sorts of determinations are never going
to be made clear under any sort of review standard.
JUSTICE ALITO:  It can clarify what the
law is.  What's the difference between that situation
and, let's say, deciding an issue of qualified immunity
in a civil rights case or applying the -- applying AEDPA
in a habeas case?  The court can say this is what the
law is, and then after that, as the second step,
determine whether a particular interpretation of the law
was reasonable.  You could do the same thing here.
MR. FLETCHER:  A court could do that here,
and I suppose the Federal Circuit, if the case came to
it on the -- the question was the District Court -- did
it abuse its discretion or did it get it right in
deciding that the party's position was unreasonable, the
could -- the court -- Federal Circuit could decide the
underlying question itself and then decide whether or
not the district court was correct in concluding that a
party's position was reasonable or unreasonable.
But we think there's -- there's good reason
not to do that here, and we think that, in these
contexts, unlike in qualified immunity, unlike in AEDPA,
the district court has particular expertise in the case
and a long experience with the case, and -- and that
requiring the Federal Circuit to engage in a thorough
review of the entire record of the litigation and the
entire proceedings of the litigation imposes a burden
that just isn't justified.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'm just wondering, if
you put together your two arguments about what the
standard should be and what the standard of review
should be, whether there really is going to be any
meaningful review of what district courts do in this
situation.
Maybe you could just describe for me what an
appellate decision would look like, saying that applying
the totality of the circumstances, the district court
abused its discretion in awarding or not awarding fees.
What would an appellate court say.
MR. FLETCHER:  So I think one thing that an
appellate court might say, as Justice Kagan alluded to
earlier, is that if the district court has based its fee
award on a misunderstanding of the law, if it got the
claim construction wrong, if it misinterpreted the
relevant patent statutes, that would obviously be an
abuse of discretion.
But I think even if the district court
correctly conceived of the law, abuse of discretion
review still leaves room for an appellate court to say
that, although the district court had a wide range of
options and has flexibility, this particular decision on
these particular facts strays too far from that range.
I think courts of appeals do that in the sentencing
context, they do that in other contexts where they
review district court decisions for abuse of discretion,
and we think that performing that role, which
abuse of discretion review comfortably accommodates,
leaves plenty of room for the Federal Circuit to rein in
any outlier district court decisions.
I think another point that's useful to keep
in mind is the extent to which applying a de novo
standard of review encourages collateral appeals.  I
think a theme of this Court's decisions about attorneys'
fees has been that a dispute over fees should not give
rise to a second major litigation, and I think applying
a de novo standard encourages that, both in encouraging
parties to take marginal appeals and also in leading to
fights about which parts of the district court's
decision are factual, which parts are legal, which
standard of review applies to different parts of a
district court's decision.
I think all of those things are -- add to
the burden of the collateral fee litigation in a way
that does -- isn't justified by the benefit that de novo
review provides.
The last point that I think I'd like to
leave you with is the notion that I think there --
Justice Alito, earlier you suggested that the Federal
Circuit has expertise in patent law and special
expertise in patent law.  And I frankly think that's the
strongest argument that the other side has.
But I'd urge you to look at Judge Moore's
dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc in this
case, where she and four of her colleagues on the
Federal Circuit explained that when you're asking
whether or not a party's litigating position was
objectively reasonable, the Federal Circuit's expertise
in patent law actually isn't the relevant expertise.
And she explains at length and she cites a number of
prior Federal Circuit decisions, recognizing as well
that the district court who's lived with the case and
who's decided on the merits and who's seen the parties
and has spent sometimes years with the parties is really
in a better position to decide whether or not the
party's litigating position was reasonable.
For that reason, if the Court has no further
questions, we'd urge it to vacate the judgment below and
remand the case to the court of appeals, with
instructions to consider the district court's award of
fees under the correct standard.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Dunner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD R. DUNNER
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. DUNNER:  May it please the Court, and
Mr. Chief Justice -- I've got that reversed.  My
apologies.
Allcare agrees that Pierce and Cooter are
highly relevant to this case, but we feel that those
cases support Allcare and not Highmark, and let me
explain.
The Pierce case starts out by talking about
the -- the traditional rule.  The traditional rule is
that legal issues are reviewed de novo.  And this
Court's opinion in the Ornelas case reinforces that for
probable cause cases.
So the question is why -- why didn't the
Federal -- why didn't the Supreme Court apply the
traditional rule in Pierce and in Cooter?  And the
answer certainly is not that they were fee cases,
because the Pierce case makes absolutely clear that it
was not enunciating a general rule for fee cases.  It
said it couldn't enunciate a general rule.
On the other hand, what the -- what the
Court did was, it looked at the specifics involved,
which was the tribunal best qualified or best situated
to decide the issues in the case.  And it dealt
specifically with three different points.
One, in the Pierce case, the EAJA statute
was involved and the text of that statute had been
changed from 1946 to 1952.  It originally used the word
"discretion."  It changed it to "exceptional case."  My
colleagues on the other side argue that the word "may"
suggests discretion.  Well, the word "may" is not
tethered to "exceptional"; it's tethered to award of
fees.  And everybody agrees that the district court has
discretion in terms of what fees are -- are awarded.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even if I assumed that
ultimately the claim that you made might have been --
might have had a basis, like the court below agreed, as
I read the district court's decision, it wasn't basing
its decision merely on that.  What it was basing it on,
and it goes through a whole laundry list of things that
it thought constituted abusive litigation -- very little
prefiling investigation, continuous switch of claims
because of the lack of that investigation, pursuing a
theory that your expert didn't even agree with -- that
all sounds to me like a factual basis, basically saying
this litigation was abusive.
And I don't understand how that doesn't feed
into the objective unreasonableness, meaning that if you
had done the investigation you should have, you may have
had a claim or thought you had a claim, but you would
have learned much earlier that even your expert disputed
things and you're likely not to have brought the suit.
That's how I read the district court's decision.
MR. DUNNER:  Your Honor, with due deference,
there were four issues -- actually five because Allcare
lost on one of the issues, the 102 claim.  There were
four issues that went up to the Federal Circuit, plus
the one we lost on.  None of them involved prefiling
investigation.
What happened was the district court wrote a
long opinion based on Rule 11.  We asked for
reconsideration.  The district court dropped all the
charges against the lawyers, left the charges against
Allcare, and if you read the Federal Circuit opinion
starting at the appendix 19A and going through the
pages, you'll see there were four issues, one of which
was not prefiling investigation, none of which involved
the points you're making.
There were four issues.  Two of them
involved claim construction, and the third one involved
claim construction -- the one we lost on.  The fourth
one was whether or not the -- the -- Allcare had a right
to rely on what happened in the Eastern District of
Virginia in which we had the same claim against a
different party and the two courts reached different
conclusions on the same issue on the same claim, which
alone should have -- should have found that it was
objectively reasonable but was not.
And the -- the last one was whether or not
alleged misconduct, misrepresentation to the Western
District of Pennsylvania before the case was
transferred, whether that was sanctionable, and the case
law made clear that was a legal question.  The case law
made absolutely clear that you cannot look at conduct
before another tribunal to decide whether a different
tribunal should sanction you.
Every one of those issues -- the three claim
construction issues were legal issues; and the --
whether the -- whether they could rely on res judicata
or collateral estoppel based on the Eastern District of
Virginia case was a legal issue; and the question of
whether the alleged misconduct in Pennsylvania could be
sanctionable was also a legal issue.  We had no factual
issues in this case.
And I suggest you look at the pages starting
with 19A and read the Court's opinion and they basically
said, contrary to Mr. Katyal's comment, the issue was
one of claim construction, it was not one of
infringement.  There was a special master in the case,
and the special master first gave a claim construction
favorable to Allcare.  And then in a summary judgment
hearing, he changed his opinion, and Judge Dyk's opinion
for the majority of the court basically notes this, that
he changed his view and he came out with a different
view.
But the issue was, is, and always a claim
construction issue.  And even they concede that claim
construction issues are reviewed de novo.
Now, a point has been made about pure issues
of law and impure issues of law.  They don't use
"impure," but I assume that's the converse of a pure
issue of law.  And they say that only certain kinds of
things are pure issues of law, and it does not include
objective baselessness.
Well, I suggest that the Court look at
Scott v.  Harris.  Scott v. Harris says expressly that
objective reasonableness is a pure issue of law reviewed
de novo when it's separated from its factual components.
And it is our position that the factual components are
reviewed deferentially.  We're not arguing to the
contrary.  All we're saying is when you've got a legal
issue, the best court situated to deal with the legal
issue and to avoid problems like we had with the Eastern
District of Virginia on the same claim, same issue,
going a different way from the Northern District of
Texas will be avoided.
The whole purpose of the formation -- this
was discussed in the Octane case.  The whole purpose of
the formation was -- of the Federal Circuit was to
provide uniformity, to provide predictability.  When
you've got 94 district courts and hundreds of district
court judges going different ways, some of which are
friendly to patents, some of which are hostile to
patents, the best tribunal to rule on the patent -- on
the legal issues, the patent issues, is the Federal
Circuit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but then it
reads four to three on one issue, then it has, as in
this case, conflicting cases within its own docket.  So
I'm not sure it's succeeding in bringing about
uniformity.
MR. DUNNER:  Your Honor, I -- I apologize.
I missed that point.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm just
saying, the point -- you're quite correct, the Federal
Circuit was established to bring about uniformity in
patent law, but they seem to have a great deal of
disagreement among themselves and are going back and
forth in particular cases, in this area specifically,
about what the appropriate approach is.
MR. DUNNER:  Your Honor, they do have
disagreement.  This was a six-five case, and there are
other cases.  The case, Lighting Ballast that was just
decided, was a six-four case, and the Akamai case which is coming in
April was a six-to-five case.  The fact is, that you
still have a single tribunal.  That's the way a court
should operate.  When they go en banc, you get a
divergence of views.  It's like the Supreme Court.  You
have lots of dissenting opinions, concurring opinions,
but it's a single body, and a single body that has
jurisdiction over all the 285 cases is better situated
than to have lots of district court judges ruling on
questions of law.  We're only talking about questions of
law.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, they do sometimes.  I
mean --
MR. DUNNER:  Pardon?
JUSTICE BREYER:  There are a lot of areas of
the law where they do.  I mean, Holmes thought
reasonableness, given undisputed facts, is really a
question of law.  Probable cause matters are really
questions of law, if the facts are undisputed.  Cases
all over the law, there was a case we had -- I had, I
saw once, it said, is an Eclectus Parrot a wild bird for
purposes of a statute that says wild birds cannot be
imported, and the judges there said, Well, is this
characteristic factual?  Da, da, da.  And is this
characteristic really -- if you really put your mind to it,
you'd have to say that was legal; does "wild" mean in
the country of origin or in the country of import?
You know, so you could separate it.  But
there are many, many areas of the law where judges don't
bother to separate the two things.  And isn't claim
construction like that?  I mean, you have a case and the
claim constructionist always has in mind what this
infringing item might be in respect to the claim, and so
the judge is always looking at that and doesn't often
separate law and fact.  I mean, am I -- you know this
area better than I do.
MR. DUNNER:  I'm not sure, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, I guarantee.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  So I'm thinking that maybe
claim construction is like that very often.  Factual
matters are there, legal matters are there, and judges
cannot always separate the one from the other, or even
if they could, they don't feel it's worth the effort.
MR. DUNNER:  Your Honor, there are times
when it may be difficult to separate facts from law, and
in the Markman case, the Court talked about it as being
a mongrel type of situation.  But the fact is that in
many cases you can separate them, and moreover, the fact
that it is a mixed question of fact and law, which has
been bandied around in the briefs, does not itself
determine whether it's de novo or discretionary as -- as
has been -- as was mentioned specifically in the Pierce
case.
So the fact is you're still better off;
which is the best tribunal to deal with the question?
I'm not saying we have a perfect answer because there's
not a perfect answer on our side, there's not a perfect
answer on their side.  But there's a best answer, and I
suggest that the best answer is to let the legal issues
decided by the court that gets tons of patent issues,
that has a lot more experience, as Justice Alito
mentioned in one of the points that he made, rather than
district court judges who may get a few cases, may get a
lot of cases, depending what district you're in.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what about
Judge Moore's point that when you're talking about pure
issues of patent law maybe you're right, but when you're
talking about baselessness, that's something that the
district courts actually have more experience with,
whether it's under EAJA, whether it's under AEDPA,
whether it's under qualified immunity.  That's an issue
they see all the time, so maybe they are more expert
than the Federal Circuit.
MR. DUNNER:  Your Honor, on the question
broadly of objective baselessness, one might say that is
so.  But on the question of objective baselessness in a
patent context, in a 285 context, where you've got legal
issues, where you've got claim construction issues, they
are certainly not better situated than the Federal
Circuit.
And I submit that certainly claim
construction is a perfect example, and the government,
in this case, acknowledges that claim construction, as
it calls it pure claim construct -- pure legal issues,
claim construction is reviewed de novo.  So that is a
perfect example of how district courts can disagree.
And this case is poster child for that because we had
two different courts going two different ways on exactly
the same point, exactly the same issue.
And the Pierce case raised, there are other
considerations involved, there are a lot of
considerations involved, but others in terms of which
tribunal is better situated.  And the Pierce case
pointed out that the size of the fee involved can be
very important.  And I'd like to address that just very
briefly.
The size of the fee involved in patent
cases, as my daughters would say, humongous.  Some of --
I've been in two cases where the legal fees were
$30 million, and when you've got legal fees like that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you've got to
stop charging such outrageous fees.
(Laughter.)
MR. DUNNER:  That's the way it used to be
with you, Your Honor.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, no.
MR. DUNNER:  The fact is, when you've got
fees like that, there is going to be an appeal.
Typically, the appeal will be consolidated with the
merits appeal.  Typically, the Court will be dealing
with the issues, both of them in the same case.  And as
Judge Dyk pointed out, having reviewed the merits
decision, the 285 decision often involves the same kind
of questions, and it is not an enormous burden on the
courts to do that.
And given the amount of the fee, there's
going to be an appeal when you've got large legal fees
regardless of the standard of review.  So you're not --
I don't think you're going to get a meaningful number of
additional appeals that you otherwise would not get.
And the fact is that the size of the fees
was independently noted in Pierce as a factor.  On the
Rule 11 issue in Cooter the -- this Court talked about
the fact that the district courts were best suited to
deal with those cases because they were familiar with
the local practices.  The whole purpose of the Federal
Circuit is not to be concerned with local practices but
to be concerned with national practices.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Two of the items that you
mentioned, one was venue, and the other was claim
preclusion, issue preclusion, the Federal Circuit is no
more expert in those areas than a district court would
be.
MR. DUNNER:  On what kind of issues, Your
Honor?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:
venue question.
MR. DUNNER:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:
The -- you mentioned the
And I was surprised.  The
Court said, well, that's for the Pennsylvania court to
sanction.
MR. DUNNER:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you, I'm sure, have
read Noxell case in the D.C. Circuit --
MR. DUNNER:  Written by you, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- one of the problems
there, one of the conduct that was considered
unreasonable was suing in -- in a distant forum, very
far from where the defendants operated.  And claim
preclusion and issue preclusion come up in all kinds of
cases, so there's nothing expert about the Federal
Circuit on those issues.
MR. DUNNER:  Your Honor, I have to
acknowledge that on an issue of whether or not a conduct
in a different circuit should be sanctionable in another
circuit, the Federal Circuit is certainly not more
expert on that kind of an issue than another court.
That -- that is merely an example of what happened in
this particular case.
I will note that the Federal Circuit cited a
number of cases which held exactly that.  And, moreover,
what happened in this case was that even the district
court -- Judge Means in the Northern District of
Texas -- noted that the Pennsylvania district court
itself did not seem to place very great reliance on it.
It probably was the least significant of all the factors
in the case.
And so I would say it is merely an example
of a legal issue.  And there will be some legal issues
in which the Federal Circuit may not be more expert than
others, but there will be a lot of legal issues, since
we're dealing with conduct in patent cases, on which the
Federal Circuit is the most expert court.
And, in any event, we're talking about how
can we get uniformity of decision-making in the 285
area, and you've got both Rule 11 and the EAJA cases
went to 13 circuits, the 285 issues go to one circuit.
So it is much better to have a single court ruling on
those questions than to have multiple district courts.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you know, once you --
once you have a statute that confers discretion on a
district court, you don't expect uniformity of
decision-making.  It gives the district judge a broad --
broad discretion, and some will come out at the top and
some will come out at the bottom.  And they will all
be -- be affirmed by the court of appeals.
So what makes you think that -- that this
statute, which clearly confers discretion, envisions
uniformity --
MR. DUNNER:  Let me --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- on the part of the
district courts?
MR. DUNNER:  Let me --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me it quite
clearly doesn't.
MR. DUNNER:  Let me address that, Your
Honor.
The -- there's a lot of argument in the
opposing briefs on the textual issue and the legislative
history, and they cite the legislative history of
Section 70, the predecessor statute in 285, and they
talk about the reviser's note and P.J. Federico's
commentary as to what the new words meant.  And the new
word -- the new words meant that they were focusing on
Section 70 as it had been interpreted by the courts.
So what do you see when you look at the
courts?  We have -- I have examined every appellate
decision from 1946 to 1952 dealing with Section 70.
There are 19 of them.  And not a single one said legal
issues are reviewed with deference.  Not a single one.
A lot of them use discretionary language, but none said
legal issues are reviewed with deference.  And
moreover --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well -- well, you -- you
acknowledged that a lot of these cases -- probably most
of these cases do not involve exclusively legal issues.
Right?
MR. DUNNER:  Exactly, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And so in -- in all of
those cases you're not going to get uniformity, because
their -- you acknowledge that in -- in the nonlegal
issues, there is discretion in the district court.  So
you're going to have some district courts coming out
some ways, other district courts coming out the other
way, and they will all be affirmed.
So the -- it seems to me -- this does not
strike me as an area where Congress expected uniformity.
MR. DUNNER:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're -- you're creating
uniformity in one narrow aspect of -- of this decision,
that involving legal claims, but there are many other
aspects of the decisions that will destroy whatever
uniformity you're trying to achieve.
MR. DUNNER:  Your Honor, I hadn't finished
my point, so let me just finish it, which is a response
to your point.  And that is these 19 cases between 1946
and 1952, many of them gave -- gave a test, and they
said the issue is abuse of discretion or -- the
disjunctive or -- a legal error.  And so all of these
cases, none of them said legal issues are reviewed
deferentially.  And all I'm saying is that if you look
at the legislative history, if you look at the textual
change of the statute, those cases in between were
concerned that the district courts were -- were
construing "with deference" too loosely, and they
tightened it up with the "exceptional case" language.
But they also said that it -- that legal
questions are reviewed de novo.  And all I'm saying is
if you look at the statute, we want the district courts
to rule on the facts.  We want the Federal Circuit to
give deference to their ruling on the facts.  But when
they get into the legal area, when they make legal
decisions, we think it should be reviewed de novo --
JUSTICE BREYER:  The problem with -- the
problem is -- the one I think that -- that really seems
to me at the heart of what you have to decide, is it
worth saying to the court of appeals start
distinguishing between which of the two categories it
falls into.  Because the statement that you read, most
lawyers would agree with that statement as a general
principle.
And then the question becomes, well, it's
work to decide whether this is purely legal or whether
it's legal/factual mixed and sometimes it's one and
sometimes the other and they are really no key to it
exactly.
So what you're doing is saying, in an area
where there are a lot of the deferential kind and some
of the nondeferential kind, we want to say the Federal
Circuit and all the district courts have to stop and
figure that thing out, while the other side says, look,
just leave it to the district court and tell them to
review.
Theirs is simpler.  What do you say?
MR. DUNNER:  Justice Breyer, my response is
that in many cases, there won't be a problem
distinguishing between law and fact.  When there is a
problem -- there will be some cases where there may be
difficulty distinguishing between law and fact, and what
Pierce says and what Cooter says and what a lot of cases
say is which is the best tribunal, the district court or
the appellate court, to deal with it?  And all I'm
saying is there are all these factors --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I'm -- I'm a
little confused.  With respect to winning or losing the
case, you're going to get de novo review because the
Federal Circuit here looked at the claim construction,
under de novo review agreed with the district court that
it had construed the claim properly and that you lost.
So you got de novo review.
The issue on a reasonable ground to pursue
the litigation, whether it was objectively reasonable or
not, I think that's Justice Breyer's point, which it
generally has factors that are independent of winning or
losing, and that's why I kept going back to what the
district court said in this case, which you seem to
ignore.  It, at one point, recognizes that your claim
was a difficult one, but it says that doesn't excuse the
fact that you maintained the 52(c) claim, the one at
issue here, even after both the master -- special master
and your expert had said a particular claim wasn't
sustainable.  And it continued with a long example of
behavior -- examples, multiple ones, that it found
unreasonable, having nothing to do with the ultimate
reasonableness of your last argument before the
appellate court.
So, again I ask the question:  Why should
this objective reasonableness be considered a pure
question of law?  Because it's not about right or wrong
and legal answer; it's about behavior during litigation.
MR. DUNNER:  Your Honor, there are -- there
are two facets to the answer I would give to that
question.
One is that all of the points you made about
what the district court found were not issues on appeal.
The district court found lots of things, but the four
issues that went up on appeal did not deal with all the
facts you're talking about.  They dealt with legal
issues.
There was no prefiling investigation issue.
The Federal Circuit expressly found that, in a footnote
in its opinion, there was no prefiling investigation
issue in the final decision on appeal.  Because the
district court made multiple decisions.  One was a
Rule 11 decision in which he didn't provide a safe
harbor for anybody, and we went in and we asked them to
reconsider it, and he changed his opinion and dropped
everything against the attorneys.
The -- what went up to the court were four
issues, and they were four legal issues.  And all I'm
saying is that -- that Scott v. -- v. Harris, and
Justice Souter, in a concurring opinion in the PRE
case, said the same thing, that objective reasonableness
is a legal issue, reviewed de novo, and if you want
uniformity, if you want predictability, the best way to
avoid chilling -- avoid chilling not only patentees but
accused infringers from being willing to go to court for
fear that they may have to pay 30 or 20 or $10 million,
and the accused infringer from defending against it, is
to have predictability, to have uniformity in
decision-making, which you get from having a single
court reviewing those cases.  And that single court is
the Federal Circuit.
And I -- I submit that those are the two
answers to your questions.  I hope I've satisfied you.
If there are no further questions, I rest.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Katyal, you have nine minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KATYAL:  Thank you.
I -- I'd like to pick up on Justice
Sotomayor's question about the facts of this case,
because I think what you heard from Mr. Dunner
illuminates our position on why the Federal Circuit's de
novo standard is so problematic.
We warned, of course, that the de novo
standard would become a magnet for litigation and
encourage 285 losers to roll the dice, hoping that they
can repackage a factual dispute as a legal one in the
court of appeals.  And Pierce and Cooter warn against
that and say that's a waste of resources as, Justice
Breyer, you're picking up on.
And, Justice Sotomayor, they say, you've
already had a merits determination, as their one here.
This case proves that.  You heard Mr. Dunner
say, quote, There were no factual issues in this case,
and he talks about the Trigon ruling from the Eastern
District of Virginia.  As the district court here found,
Petition Appendix 63A, Trigon was irrelevant because the
question was infringement, not claim construction.  And
that was why sanctions were imposed.  And if there's any
doubt, here's what Allcare's own lawyer told the Federal
Circuit in 2009.  These are his opening words, quote:
Summary judgment was granted at the district court in
this case for two reasons.  First, it was held there was
a lack of evidence from which a reasonable finder of
fact could determine the step of 52(c); and secondly,
the district court held even if there was evidence that
step 52(c) was performed, there was insufficient
evidence of direction or control.
Question from the Court:  This really seems
like it's a claim construction issue for us as to the
meaning of this claim.
Answer from Allcare's lawyer:  I would
disagree that claim construction ought to be revisited
at this level.  In 1999, this court expressly stated it
was inappropriate to sua sponte revisit it.
Now, I'm sorry to belabor the facts here,
but I think they illustrate the wisdom of Justice
Scalia's opinion in Pierce, as followed by Cooter and
Koon, which is clever lawyers can always make arguments
on appeal, make them look -- make them look legal when
they were factual.  This case is example A of that.
Now, my friend on the other side has said
that -- that there wasn't history from 1946 to 1952.  We
encourage the Court to look to the -- to the cases cited
at pages 11 to 13 of our brief, and in particular to
look at Orrison v. Hoffberger, a Fourth Circuit case,
which says that in evaluating whether there's, quote, no
reasonable ground for the prosecution of a motion, the
court says it, quote, cannot be said there was abuse of
discretion.
In many of these cases, they refer to the
Abuse of discretion standard.  And, of course,
Mr. Dunner is right, that if it's a pure issue of law,
that is something as to which there isn't deference.
But when the question looks, as it does here, as it does
in 285 cases about objective baselessness, whether a
litigating position was reasonable after the fact in
collateral attorney fee litigation, this Court has
always said in all of these cases that
abuse-of-discretion deferential review is appropriate.
Now, Justice Alito, you had referred to the
size of the award here, and to be sure, it is different
than Pierce.  It's not different, of course, than Cooter
because in Cooter we're talking about Rule 11 sanctions
which can devastate an attorney's livelihood.  And
nonetheless, the Court in Cooter said they would
apply -- apply deferential abuse of discretion review
there.
I think the best answer to that is Koon
itself.  In Koon, the stakes were really high, jail
time, and what the Court said is defer to the district
court because the district court has the best
perspective, the kind of bird's eye view, a front seat
on litigation.
And that's why this case is different, than
for example, Scott v. Harris or, Justice Alito, the
qualified immunity cases.  Because in both of those,
those questions involved things as to which the district
court doesn't have a courtside or ringside, whatever
term we want to use, seat.  They are not present.  They
are not there at the scene of the crime.  They are not
there when law enforcement is conducting whatever
operation or something like that.
Scott v. Harris, same thing, it's not a
qualified immunity case; it's a summary judgment case.
And the words, as our brief points out at page 24, say,
If there is no factual dispute, then you evaluate it on
the law.  We -- we agree with that.
The question is here, where there are
factual disputes, as there are in all objective
baselessness cases, what is the appropriate standard.
This Court's answered it several times in Pierce,
Cooter, and Koon, unitary abuse of discretion review.
If there are no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the case in the
