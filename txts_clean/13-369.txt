CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 13-369, Nautilus v. Biosig
Instruments.
Mr. Vandenberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. VANDENBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. VANDENBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court.
The Patent Act requires particular and
distinct claims, but the claim in this case is not
particular and distinct.  It is ambiguous because it has
two reasonable readings with very different claim
scopes, even after all of the interpretive tools are
applied.
Such ambiguous claims defeat the public
notice function which is at the heart of Section 112,
and they increase litigation.  They cause more claim
construction disputes, and they cause more reversals of
district court claim construction rulings.
Taken all together, ambiguous claims and the
Federal circuit's test allowing ambiguous claims defeats
the very purpose of Section 112 and the patent system,
namely, to encourage and promote innovation by others
after the first patent issues.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why is this claim
ambiguous?  It's evident that these electrodes have to
be close enough so that the user's hand contacts both
electrodes, but separate enough to heap -- keep
electrodes distinct.  Why isn't that sufficiently
definite?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Your Honor, if -- if that
were the only reasonable construction, then that may
suffice.  However, here, the other reasonable
construction is that the spaced relationship is a
special spacing that causes the electrodes to achieve
the desired result.  And that was the construction that
the majority found at the Federal circuit, namely, that
spaced relationship is not what it sounds like, namely,
any spacing, but rather is a special spacing that is
derived by trial-and-error testing to get the spacing
just right so that the electrodes detect --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't think the
majority or the -- or the concurrence or the other side
disagreed with that.  The only question was whether it
was part of the specifications or not.  I thought that
was the only difference between them.  They both agreed
ultimately that the electrodes had to cancel out -- was
it the EMGs?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So they both agreed that
that was part of the scope.  The only issue was, was it
part of the specifications or part of the claims,no?  But
both of them make up the scope of the patent.
MR. VANDENBERG:  Your Honor, we would submit
that the disagreements between the judges and, in fact,
between Biosig itself went to the scope of the claim,
namely, does the scope of the claim cover all ways of
achieving the desired result no matter how the
electrodes are spaced.  That's one possible reading.
The other possible reading is that the
claims cover only a special spacing of the electrodes to
achieve the desired result.  And why that matters is if
you think of the inventor in 1994 who invents a new
material for electrodes, and this new material achieves
the desired result of detecting equal muscle signals on
the left and right side, regardless of the spacing of
the electrode.  So it doesn't matter where you put the
electrodes, as long as you can touch them, this new
material achieved the -- the desired goal.
That inventor would not know in 1994 if they
infringed or not, because if the claims had the
interpretation that the majority eventually gave them,
namely, that the spaced relationship has this functional
limitation and it must be the result of this
trial-and-error balancing, there'd be no infringement.
But if spaced relationship meant any spacing, then there
would be infringement.  So that is the exact type of
zone of uncertainty that United Carbon warned against
and which deters the innovation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it can't mean
any spacing, because anyone skilled in the art would
know the hand has to cover it.  So you're basically
talking about a fairly narrow range between one side of
the hand and the other and not too close together  but
they don't -- don't work.  And that seems to me that
someone skilled in the art can just try a couple of
things and see where -- where the trial and error.
Trial and error makes -- could mean a very difficult
thing, like Edison discovering what works in a light
bulb.  But here you've got a very limited range and
someone skilled in the art will just, well, let's try
it, you know, close to the middle, let's try it to so
far apart.  But it's not any spaced relationship.
MR. VANDENBERG:  And that's correct, Your
Honor, and I do -- when I refer to any spacing, it's
really a shorthand for any spacing that is narrow enough
so that the hand can actually touch both electrodes but
not touching.  So I agree that under each interpretation
it makes sense that the electrodes have to be touchable
by a single hand, and they can't be touching each other
or there'd simply be a single electrode.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What would be the
purpose of the invention if it were only covering
spacing without the function of canceling the EMG?  I
can't understand, if I read this patent, what it would
do unless you add its function.
MR. VANDENBERG:  Well, Your Honor, the
purpose of the patent is it would cover possibly, again,
all techniques for achieving the desired function.  So
again, going back to the invention of the new material,
if the inventor comes up with a specific way of
achieving the result, and here they came up with trial
and error spacing, they didn't describe that in the
patent.  That didn't -- that wasn't described by the
inventor until 15 years later.  But nevertheless, let's
say they had this specific way of achieving it.  They
very well could have drafted the claim intentionally the
way they did to have a broader coverage so that they
cover all possible ways of achieving that desired
result.  Patent attorneys are trained to try to draft
the claims, you know, some claims as broadly as
possible.  So that reading by the concurrence was a very
plausible reading of this claim.  Reading the claim, it
has any spaced relationship as long as, as the Chief
Justice indicated, I can touch them and they're not
touching each other.  But that's it.  There's no other
restriction on what "spaced relationship" means.  That's
a very reasonable interpretation and that was the
interpretation that Biosig asserted at the Markman claim
construction in this case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you -- you acknowledge
that it -- it would be a valid patent if all you said is
you have to space these things and you figure out what
the spacing is going to be.  You -- you can -- you can
get a patent for -- tell somebody trial and error.
Let's take Edison's light bulb.  I mean, could he say,
you know, get some material that -- that will -- will
illumine when -- when electricity is passed through it
and you figure out by trial and error what this material
might be.  Might be tungsten, who knows, you know.
Maybe it's chewing gum.  Would that be a valid patent?
MR. VANDENBERG:  It would not, Your Honor.
That --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So I don't -- I don't
really understand this trial and error spacing stuff.
What -- what is the limit on trial and error?  Can you
get patented anything when you say, you know, this is
the basic principle, you figure out what -- you know,
what makes it work.
MR. VANDENBERG:  Well, Your Honor,
there's -- there's two levels of indefiniteness here.
First, it's unclear which construction was intended.  So
basically, there are two reasonable --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  I understand that.
MR. VANDENBERG:  But the second --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm asking why the second
construction is -- is a plausible patentable invention.
MR. VANDENBERG:  Your Honor, it's not
patentable.  In fact, it would be indefinite.  However,
the person of skill in the art reading the claim is not
expected to do a full-blown invalidity analysis.
They're simply trying to figure out, where can I
innovate.  I see this patent.  It issues in '94.  The --
the alternative --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All the person skilled in
the art will know is that he has to figure out what the
spacing is, right?
MR. VANDENBERG:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but still the -- the
inventor doesn't tell you what the spacing has to be.
MR. VANDENBERG:  Well, that is the second
problem.  We agree.  The second problem with these
claims is they're purely functional.  They simply have a
clause that says whereby good things happen, namely,
that equal muscle signals are detected.  The claims
don't tell you how.  They leave that up in the air.
Maybe it has something to do with the spacing
electrodes, but maybe not.
And the further problem is that the
specification here did not describe any technique for
achieving the desired result.  If one reads the
specification, you read it and it says various things
and it says, whereby the muscle signals are detected as
being equal on both hands, on both electrodes.  Well, in
reality, the -- the electrical signals on my left and
right palms are unequal.  Somehow, however, the
electrodes detect them as if they're being equal.  The
patent doesn't say how.  It doesn't say why.  It doesn't
say what causes it.  So this is the purely functional
type of claim that United Carbon and General Electric --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you -- do you
have any disagreement with a standard that's articulated
by the Solicitor General?  He says that, you know, a
patent satisfies the requirement if, in light of the
specification and the prosecution history, a person
skilled in the art would reasonably understand the scope
of the claim.
MR. VANDENBERG:  Your Honor, we may or may
not, depending on how the Solicitor General would apply
that standard to a claim that has two reasonable
interpretations after the person of skill in the art
reads the claim in light of the specification and
applies all the interpretive tools.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Court has to come up
with a formula.  You were saying the Federal Circuit's
formula is no good.  The Solicitor General has, as the
Chief Justice just said, has suggested an appropriate
formula.  And you say, well, it depends on the
application.  As a formula, do you agree?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Your Honor, we -- we think
it's -- it would certainly be an improvement over the
Federal Circuit's amenable to construction and insolubly
ambiguous test.  The Solicitor General refers to
reasonably understand.  The parties have agreed on the
phrasing of "reasonable certainty."  We think
"reasonable certainty" comes out of this Court's cases,
and therefore, we prefer that.  To the extent,
obviously, "reasonably understand" means the same as
"reasonable certainty," then -- then we accept that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's what
I'm having trouble dealing with.  I would suspect your friends
on the other side will say yes, right, that they accept
that, too.  And you say, but it can't be insolubly
ambiguous or not amenable to construction.  And they
say, well, that's not really what the Federal Circuit
said.
So until we get to the application, I don't
see much disagreement among any of you about the
standard or what's wrong with the Federal Circuit's
articulation.  And the questions kind of suggest we move
very quickly into the particular invention and the
application.  And I'm just -- I'm curious what you want
us to do if it seems like in every case, we have to get
right into the application rather than the legal
standards.
MR. VANDENBERG:  Well, I think the -- the
key dispute here is what happens if, after all the
interpretive tools are applied, there's a genuine
ambiguity, meaning there really are two reasonable
interpretations of the claim.  Genuine ambiguity, person
of skill in the art applying all the interpretive tools,
trying to understand the claiming.  What happens then?
Our position is that if such a claim, which
essentially points in two different directions, is
indefinite, the problem with the Federal Circuit's test
is the Federal Circuit would not find that indefinite.
Instead, the Federal Circuit would pick one because it's
amenable to construction.  They would pick one.  They
would then ask is the construction they picked itself
sufficiently clear for a person of skill in the art.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if a -- what if a
person who's a skilled artisan says that the claim could
mean A and it could mean B, they're both reasonable
constructions, but this person is reasonably certain it
means A, but not B?  What would happen then?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Well, I think the -- the
proper analysis would be to look at the alternative
construction and ask:  Was that a reasonable
interpretation?  Was the second interpretation a
reasonable interpretation of the claim?  And courts
every day make judgments like that, whether
interpretations, for instance, of statutes.  A second
interpretation of a statute is reasonable.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the only -- the only
analog that comes to my mind immediately is our review
of agency action.  Is -- is that the standard that you
want us to use?  If -- if, you know, it's within the
scope of the ambiguity, oh, we don't think that's the
right answer.  But it's close enough for government
work.  Is that -- is that what you want us to apply to
patents?
MR. VANDENBERG:  No, Your Honor, because the
starting point here is the text of the statute.  The
text of the statute could hardly be more emphatic.
Section 112 requires that the invention be described in
full, clear, concise, and exact terms and then be
claimed particularly and distinctly.  Given that text of
the statute, given the statutory purpose of protecting
the next innovator from uncertainty, we think that that
statutory language needs to be enforced, you know,
forcefully.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can it be reasonable but
wrong.
MR. VANDENBERG:  No, Your Honor.  If a claim
--
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see.  Whatever
interpretation is wrong is ipso facto unreasonable?
MR. VANDENBERG:  If -- if I understand
correctly, a claim has only one proper construction.  If
a claim is subject --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So whatever is wrong
is -- is, by your definition -- you know, we -- we
construe statutes all the time, and we certainly don't
think that the result we come to is the only reasonable
result.  We think it's the best result, but not the only
reasonable one.  But you're saying in this field there's
a right result and everything else is unreasonable.
MR. VANDENBERG:  What -- what we're -- we
would analogize it most closely to -- to the Chevron
ambiguity analysis.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, that's what I proposed
first.  But I thought -- I thought you didn't like that.
MR. VANDENBERG:  Well, if I misunderstood
the question I apologize.  But my understanding is in
order to determine whether or not there is ambiguity in
the statute, that the Court first looks to the statutory
language and then applies interpretive tools.  The same
is true here.  And then the Court -- if the Court finds
there are more than one reasonable readings, then the
Court will designate the -- the statute as ambiguous and
then move on for the remainder of the Chevron analysis.
Under this statute, however, if the Court
determines the claim is ambiguous, the proper result is
invalidity.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what is -- what is
the ambiguity?  Is it -- I thought from your brief that
it was the term "space relationship."  Is that the --
what -- what is the ambiguity?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor.  It is the
term "space relationship" in the context of the claim.
And again, the ambiguity is that this claim either
covers all possible spacing of the electrodes within the
boundaries that we've discussed or it only covers
special spacings of the electrodes that are a result of
trial and error in order to achieve the desired result.
Those are hugely different claim scopes and that -- that
uncertainty between those two is what would chill
innovation.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did you -- did you
proffer any evidence below showing that a person with
ordinary skill in the art did not understand what this
claim meant?  Your brief seems to rely only on the
dispute between the majority and the concurrence.  But
was there -- did you proffer any evidence below?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Your Honor, we did not
proffer our own experts.  The -- the evidence below
included that Biosig's own expert asserted that each of
the competing constructions was reasonable, in essence.
More specifically, he said that -- this was Dr.
Gannoulas said at Joint Appendix 274 -- that "The person
of skill in the art could readily discern the trial
court's construction of spaced relationship."  The trial
court's construction was any spacing.
Then the expert went on and said, "The
person of skill in the art could easily discern the
claim scope because the EMG signals have to be
substantially removed."  That was the competing
functional construction of spaced relationship.  So
their own expert supported both of these competing
constructions and the reason they were comfortable doing
that is because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, I have a really big
problem, which is we as Justices disagree on the meaning
of things all the time, and one side will say, this is
perfectly clear from the text of the statute, from
its -- from its history, from its context.  And we do
all the statutory tools, and  there’ll be one or more
of us who will come out and say, no, we think it's a
different interpretation.  Would we have any valid
patents in the world if that's the standard that we --
that we adopt?  That if any judge on a panel thinks that
there's another interpretation, that that's sufficient
to invalidate a patent as indefinite?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Your Honor, we are not
taking the position that because the judges below
disagreed on the construction, that that is dispositive
or proves ambiguity in the claim.  We -- we did say the
fact that Biosig itself took both competing
constructions as the need arose --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the majority -- but
the majority here said that it was clear from the
prosecution history, the specifications, and the
description that this was definite.  I don't know on
what basis I would have to overturn their review of that
issue.
MR. VANDENBERG:  Well, that -- that Biosig
has taken both claim constructions.  We've not seen them
assert that either claim construction was unreasonable.
The majority did not find the concurrence's construction
unreasonable.  Nor did it find the trial court's
construction unreasonable.  Their experts took both
positions.  So we have a claim that on its face -- I
mean, the starting point is looking at the patent, of
course, not what judges or experts or parties said
later.  The patent on its face is grammatically
ambiguous.  There is a whereby clause dangling in the
middle of the claim that says whereby something good
happens.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  We understand all
that.  I -- I'm still having trouble understanding what
your standard is.  You -- you agree that your standard
is not, there is a right answer and everything that is
not the right answer is unreasonable.  That's not your
position.
MR. VANDENBERG:  That's right, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Then you invoke
Chevron.  Do you mean that anything that would pass
Chevron's step one is okay?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That is, if it would pass
Chevron's step one it's ambiguous.
MR. VANDENBERG:  Well, if -- let me be clear
about "pass."  If it's ambiguous under Chevron step one,
then that is a close parallel to being ambiguous
under -- under Section 112, paragraph 2.  But again, our
starting point, of course, is not Chevron.  It's the
statutory text, which -- and the standard we submit is
to assert -- I'm sorry, to enforce the statutory text by
its plain terms.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would this -- would this
help?  Do you agree that the standard at the PTO, and
let's say that it's whether or not -- the claim is
definite if a person skilled in the art would be
reasonably certain of its scope.  Is the standard used
by the PTO the same standard that the CA Fed ought to
use?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Yes, it is, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  How does --
that's a sensible answer, I think.  Now, how does the
presumption of validity bear on -- on the application of
the -- of that same standard in the court of appeals?
MR. VANDENBERG:  The presumption of validity
certain applies to this defense.  It requires the
challenger to raise the defense, to preserve the
defense, you know, plead it as affirmative defense, to make the
initial argument as to why the claim is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Doesn't that imply some
deference on findings of fact?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Your Honor, it would be
rare for there to be, in an indefiniteness case, to be
any underlying finding of fact.  The -- the issue of
indefiniteness is really subsidiary.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does it imply -- what sort
of deference does it accord to the PTO?
MR. VANDENBERG:  If indeed --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That is, the presumption
of validity, does that accord some deference to the PTO?
And how would that apply or not apply here?
MR. VANDENBERG:  It would apply -- it does
not apply in this case.  There are no fact findings out
of the Patent Office regarding indefiniteness.  But if
there was -- the same indefiniteness issue came up and
the Patent Office found, for instance, that a term of
art, so let's say nanotechnology, biotechnology term of art
had a particular meaning, then that fact-finding may be
entitled to deference by the trial court.
However, indefiniteness itself is a legal
determination.  The Federal Circuit said that.  They
review this.  They know --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So there's no deference to
the PTO as to that legal interpretation.
MR. VANDENBERG:  No, Your Honor, no more
than there'd be deference to the Patent Office claim
construction or any other legal decision.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  The -- the quotation that
the Chief Justice read to you from the Solicitor
General's brief referred to the use of prosecution
history.  Do you agree with the Solicitor General about
that use, about the permissibility of that use?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor, so long as
the prosecution history that's being used to clarify
existed at the date the patent issued. If the person of
skill in the art again is supposed to be motivated to
innovate around the patent the day it issues.  Here
there is a re-examination prosecution history.
Sometimes there is later prosecution history in a
related patent.  That type of prosecution history
shouldn't be used to sort of ex post facto cure an
initial indefiniteness.
But putting aside that rare instance, yes,
the prosecution history and the specification are part
of the interpretive tools that are available and would
be used.
I think it's important to remember here that
there is no legitimate need or excuse for ambiguity in
patent claims.  Once the applicant has satisfied
paragraph one and its strict requirements for describing
the invention, it is easy to claim the invention
particularly and distinctly.  The only reason that there
are so many ambiguous claims out there today is that
patent attorneys are trained to deliberately include
ambiguous claims.  Ambiguous claims make the patent
monopoly more valuable.  Every patent attorney knows
that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The government tells us
there are some 22,000 patent grants since 1976 that use
the term "spaced relationship."  I suppose many of those
would fail your test?
MR. VANDENBERG:  Not likely, Your Honor.  It
would be highly unlikely in more than 99 percent of
those cases that there'd be any uncertainty of what
"spaced relationship" meant.  The problem here is not
those words.  It's the grammatical ambiguity in the
claim.  It's the fact that the specification did not
describe, even arguably, the invention.  That wasn't
described, the trial and error spacing, until 15 years
later, and that the patent specification has no concrete
examples of embodiments inside the claim or outside the
claim.
So we ask that the Court reaffirm its
precedents in United Carbon, General Electric and Eibel
Process.  Eibel Process upheld a claim that had vague
sounding language.  The language was "high elevation,"
"substantial elevation," but it was upheld because that
patent specification concretely described the invention,
its theory of operation, concrete examples that came
inside the claim scope, concrete examples that fell
outside.  And that's why that patent satisfied the
particular and distinct claiming requirement and this
one does not.
I'll reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Harris.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. HARRIS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HARRIS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The decision of the Federal Circuit should
be affirmed for two reasons:  First, that court
correctly held that the test for definiteness is whether
a claim puts a skilled artisan on reasonable notice of
the boundaries of the invention, and secondly, whatever
--
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If that's -- if that's what
it held we wouldn't have taken this case.  I thought we
took it because it had some really extravagant language.
MR. HARRIS:  The court, the court below used
the word --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, it's one thing to
run away from that language, as your brief does.  It's
another thing to deny that it exists.
MR. HARRIS:  Justice Scalia, we are not
denying that those words exist, "insolubly ambiguous,"
but what I think this court below, the Federal Circuit,
in this case explained, and it's explained consistently,
is that that -- those two words are not the test all by
themselves.  In this very case --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You would agree, I take
it, that if, was it, "insolubly ambiguous" were the
standard that the court used, that we should reverse?
MR. HARRIS:  If there were no other context
and only those words alone would be used, it seems that
some district courts might misinterpret those words, as
the Solicitor General has mentioned, but --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it was fair, as I
suggested earlier, nobody agrees with that formulation;
right?
MR. HARRIS:  Yes, I guess so, Your Honor.
But I want to -- I just want to clarify what that point
is.  What the Federal Circuit said below, the full
statement of its test that it was applying in this case,
was:  If reasonable efforts at claim construction result
in a definition that does not provide sufficient
particularity and clarity to inform skilled artisans of
the bounds of the claim, the claim is insolubly
ambiguous and invalid for indefiniteness.  There is no
suggestion that the court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is a subtle -- no,
there is, if you read that language carefully.  It seems
to be saying that what has to be reasonably definite is
the court's construction, and it takes the emphasis away
from whether a skilled -- someone skilled in the art
would be definite.  There is a big difference between
can I read this and give it a construction and whether
or not a construction is definite enough so someone
skilled in the art could understand it.
MR. HARRIS:  We would completely agree that
the test needs to include what the skilled artisan would
have understood at the time.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's my problem with
the Federal Circuit's articulation and as you read its
decisions.  Its focus is not always on that question.
Its focus seems to be on the reasonableness of its
construction, as opposed to the reasonableness of a
skilled artisan's or whether skilled, someone skilled in
the art could reasonably construe the scope of this
patent.
MR. HARRIS:  But I think it's quite clear
from the way the Federal Circuit actually applied the
standard in this case that the Federal Circuit was
looking to what the evidence was as to what skilled
artisans would do with this claim language.  If anything
it's Nautilus that's arguing that it doesn't seem to
matter what a skilled artisan thought at the time.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do you see as
the difference?  He says that the concurrence's
definition is different from the majority's.  The
government -- explain -- I read your brief.  I know what
you think the difference is, but --
MR. HARRIS:  Well, between the majority and
the concurrence below, first, we don't think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He says there is a
difference in scope, so address that.
MR. HARRIS:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why don't you see that
as being a difference of importance?
MR. HARRIS:  It would be a difference if
there were a difference in scope, but there isn't one.
I think it's very important to look at what the majority
and the concurrence actually did.  The majority was
addressing definiteness.  The majority did that in two
steps.  The majority said we are going to apply the
principles of claim construction.  The first thing it
did was it looked to the claim language, the written
specification, the diagrams, all the traditional tools
of patent interpretation.  It said there is definiteness
here because there are bounds to the spaced
relationship.  It isn't just anything, it has to be
greater than zero, it has to be less than the width of a
hand.  It's implicit in the -- actually explicit in the
statements of the patent.
Then it said that the functional limitation,
which is the whereby clause in the patent, sheds
additional light.  That's where the concurrence got off
the train and the concurrence said:  I don't think we
need to reach that issue.  Nautilus has turned that
approach on its head.  Nautilus says that the fact that
the concurrence didn't think it was necessary to reach
the functional limitation, in fact said that it's not
before us for procedural reasons, Nautilus reads that as
if the concurrence was somehow disavowing or disclaiming
the majority's approach.  It never said that.  It was a
procedural argument that it had.  Then, in fact, there
is no disagreement between the majority and the
concurrence.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would this patent be valid
if the concurrence's approach prevailed?  It wouldn't
work, would it?  It would not work.  The mere fact that
you spaced it somewhere where the hands can touch it
would not necessarily produce the result, would it?
MR. HARRIS:  If the patent said nothing
other than there is a space between --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's all the claim said.
MR. HARRIS:  Well, no, no, Justice Scalia.
The whereby clause explicitly said -- it described the
structure.  This case is quite different from General
Electric, where there was no structure being given.  It
said that there is going -- there are going to be EMG
signals that are going to be detected by the electrodes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. HARRIS:  Then those signals, which will
be detected as equal, are going to be fed into a
differential amplifier and thereby subtracted or
canceled out.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whereby.  Whereby.  I would
read that as saying so long as you put the spacing at
some point where the hands can touch it and they are not
touching, that will produce the result that the signals
will be equalized.  That's how I would read the claim.
MR. HARRIS:  Well, in fact, if the
electrodes are configured in such a way that they
detected the signals as equal --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no.
MR. HARRIS:  -- it would produce that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  Yes, I understand
that, but that's not what it says.  It doesn't say space
the electrodes in such a manner that the signals coming
from each side will be equal and you'll have to do this
by trial and error.  That's not what it says.  It just
says, you know, keep the electrodes apart.  They have to
be apart so that the hands don't touch, and on the other
hand they can't be outside the scope of what the hands
grip.  That's all it says.  Whereby, if you do that, the
signals will be equalized.  That's -- that's how I would
read it.  It wouldn't work that way, would it?
MR. HARRIS:  It wouldn't work if it gave no
specifics.  But this is where the fact that it all
depends on what the skilled artisan would do is
critical.  Because there was uncontested evidence that a
skilled artisan in 1992 was able to read this patent and
understand how to put together this invention in such a
way that it worked.  In fact, Dr. Galiana's research
assistant did it, in 2 hours was able to build this
invention based on the diagrams.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm a little confused here.
Imagine there are two kinds of electrodes, a blue one
and a green one, and you have to have a blue one and
green one on left hand and a blue one and green one on
right hand.  And now, you cannot let them touch.  The
blue can't touch the green.  I got that.  And suppose on
your left hand you put the blue one here and the green
one there.  And in the right hand, you put the blue in
here and the green in here.  See, they're not touching,
but they're different distances from each other in the
two hands.  Does it work or not?
MR. HARRIS:  If the distances on the two
sides --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Look, look.  This is like
that one hand.
MR. HARRIS:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And this one's like the
other hand.  Okay?  So does it work or not?
MR. HARRIS:  I don't -- I don't know
whether --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let the record show that
the Justice is holding his fingers in the air.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Look, on the
green one is two inches -- the space between the green
one and the right one is like a half inch for the left
hand, and it's like one inch for the right hand.  Okay?
Does it work?
MR. HARRIS:  If I could answer that
question, Justice Breyer, in a -- in a more roundabout
way.  What the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It was asked in a pretty
roundabout way.
(Laughter.)
MR. HARRIS:  What the uncontested evidence
showed was that a skilled artisan at the time knew how
to space electrodes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Then did he know that they
had to be -- like if you put it two inches across here,
so there are two inches between them, and over here it's
like a half inch between them, did he know it did work
or did he know it didn't work?
MR. HARRIS:  He would know by --
JUSTICE BREYER:  He knew if it worked, but I
want to know if it does work.
MR. HARRIS:  It probably would not work in
that situation.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, as soon as you
say that, that's his point.  His point is that when I
read it -- I guess that's the point that's being made.
When I read it, it just seems to me that the green one
can't touch the blue one, and the whole thing has to fit
within your hand, so each of them catches a finger.  And
he's saying that isn't good enough.  That doesn't work.
They have to be the same distance.  And what that
distance is, this document doesn't tell us.  And it
doesn't even tell us they have to be the same distance.
So therefore, since it doesn't tell us that, it's
ambiguous.  Is that the correct argument?  All right.
We think it's the correct argument.  So now, what's your
answer?
MR. HARRIS:  This Court has never found a
problem with the need for some amount of experimentation
in order to get the parameters exactly right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't even say that.
It doesn't even say that.  It doesn't say go experiment
whether somebody with great big fingers on one hand and
tiny little fingers on the other hand --
MR. HARRIS:  In -- in Eibel Process, this
Court faced -- as Mr. Vandenberg mentioned -- faced a
case in which a method of manufacturing paper, all it
said was that the angle of the supply of the pulp had to
be high.  Didn't say anything more than that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it part of an
answer to Justice Breyer's question that the diagram
shows them equally spaced or is that not relevant?
MR. HARRIS:  I don't think the equal spacing
is the only issue, Mr. Chief Justice.  The issue is how
do you find what that spacing is.  And the answer, the
uncontested answer, is that skilled artisans were able
to do that very quickly.  It's not trial and error as if
it's throwing darts and just seeing what might work.
It's just like tuning a radio.  Just happen to move
things around in order you get that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why doesn't that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You know, I can understand
that if the claim said that.  If the claim said, you
know, fiddle with it until it works.  But it doesn't say
that.  It just says, you know, spacing, and I would
think so long as there's space, they don't touch, and
they're no more than the widths of the hands, it'll
work.  It doesn't say that.  I don't think the "whereby"
is -- is an invitation to experiment.
But the other case you were talking about,
tell us more about it.  It just said a high angle.
MR. HARRIS:  It's at a high angle.  Minerals
Separation maybe is even a stronger case.  In Minerals
Separation, it was a method for extracting ore from --
metal -- metallic ore from --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why are you -- why are
you running from -- the working here is that it cancels
out a signal, correct?
MR. HARRIS:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so what the majority
said is that that function is part of the understanding
of the spacing.  Isn't that what the majority said?
MR. HARRIS:  It said that an additional
constraint on the spacing is the fact that it has --
that it will work in a certain way.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I don't know whether
it has to be equal spacing or one could be one inch and
the other half an inch apart.  The bottom line is that
to work, it has to cancel out, that that's part of the
scope.
MR. HARRIS:  Yes.  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, the concurrence
said, no, you don't have -- you can't -- I'm not looking
at the specification.
MR. HARRIS:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think it's definite
without it.
MR. HARRIS:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  I don't see
how it could be.  That's what I think Justice Scalia is
saying and Justice Breyer is saying, that if we don't
understand what the purpose is, how can that spacing be
definite enough to make this thing work.
So tell us why you think that the
concurrence's interpretation is wrong.  What's he
missing?
MR. HARRIS:  The word -- when -- when it
says "whereby," the whereby means the elements that came
before are going to produce that result.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mm-hmm.
MR. HARRIS:  There's never been a problem
with the fact that a -- some amount of
experimentation -- I hate to even call it that because
it's really just tuning dials on a radio -- may be
needed in order to get the exact number, the exact
setting.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Result that the
specification --
MR. HARRIS:  But what the whereby clause
says, it -- it conveys a structure.  It says they have
to be detected, the signals, in such a way that they're
equal.  That normally wouldn't be the case.  In all the
devices that existed up to that time, they wouldn't be
equal.  Signals would come in from the right and the
left hand that during exercise would be unequal, because
when a person is running or moving, the right hand and
left hand have different amounts of contact with the
electrodes.
The whole novelty of this was the fact that
you didn't have to cancel EMG signals, what we call
downstream, meaning by just filtering them out.  They
could be detected in such a way that they would be equal
and then be cancelled.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why didn't the patent
provide more specificity as to the exact spacing?
MR. HARRIS:  Because like Eibel Process and
like Mineral Separation, it wasn't possible.  It
depended on too many variables.  It depended -- the
actual spacing in every single instance would depend on
four variables.  This was made clear in the expert
declarations.  The size of the electrode, the shape of
the electrode, the spacing between the electrodes, and
the materials, those four things.  Just like in Eibel
Process, what the Court said was, you may not know in
advance what it is.  But a skilled artisan will know.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the apparatus
on which the electrodes are mounted?  Isn't that another
variable way you can't say half an inch, because it
depends, as you said, on size, shape, and materials of
the electrodes.  But doesn't it also depend on the
apparatus?
MR. HARRIS:  Yes.  Yes, it does.  It does.
The critical point is that there's no question that a
skilled artisan knew how to do this.  They've introduced
no evidence that a skilled artisan didn't know this.  In
fact, their entire argument is based on attorneys coming
up with arguments later.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what about
the case that he postulated, an abstract one, where you
have two perfectly reasonable constructions.  What --
what happens then?
MR. HARRIS:  If there are two constructions,
each of which has survived the Markman claim
construction process, and each one of them does the
things that Markman says the correct construction needs
to do, which is that it fully comports with the
instrument as a whole and it preserves the patent's
internal coherence, then yes, we would agree in that
case it's indefinite.  But what they've put forward --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Doesn't Markman exist for a
different purpose?  I thought that Markman existed in
order to explain things to a lay juror or a lay judge.
Why should the Markman test be used in this context,
where we're trying to figure out a different question
entirely?
MR. HARRIS:  Well, I -- I'm not sure I agree
with the premise, Your Honor.  The Markman explained
that the nature of the test may need to be -- or the
nature of the process may need to be necessarily
sophisticated.  It's a hard thing to construe -- to
construe claims, and we -- it depends critically on the
abilities of the skilled artisan to do that.
Just to return to that -- to that -- to the
point again, because I think it's such an important
point.  All they're relying on here are attorney
arguments.  In fact, this morning, just now,
Mr. Vandenberg mentioned that the ambiguity isn't even
in the words "space relationship."  This is the first
time I ever heard that.  It's actually somehow in the
whereby clause.  That argument was never made at any
time below or up until now.
And the reason that's critical -- I'm not
arguing waiver -- but the reason that's critical is the
rule that Nautilus is suggesting here will encourage
attorneys years after infringement has occurred to just
come up with some way to argue that there is something
that's unclear in the patent.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could I -- could I
just go back to my -- you know, the two reasonable.  Is
there a range?  The Chevron -- the Chevron analogy again
comes to mind.  Let's say one is more reasonable than
the other, but they're both reasonable.  What type of
range do you have before you say that the patent is
invalid?
MR. HARRIS:  I think I agree with the
comments that were -- the questions that were asked
before, that it's very common in matters of statutory
interpretation to have different answers, some of which
are reasonable but are incorrect.  We hold -- we believe
that the test requires that the -- if there's -- there
has to be more than one correct construction before it's
going to be indefinite.  If it only depends on the fact
that there are reasonable interpretations that are made
in good faith that lawyers are arguing or that jurists
have come to, that's not going to be enough.  Any more
than it is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There's never more than one
correct construction.  Even -- even when there is there
isn't.  I mean, we always have to come up with an
answer.  And the patent office has to come up with an
answer.  It means this or it doesn't mean this.  Have
you ever heard of a court that says, well, you know, it
could mean either one of these?
MR. HARRIS:  No.  In fact, I think --
Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a tie.
(Laughter.)
MR. HARRIS:  I -- I think that's the point.
The point is that one of the constructions is going to
be better.  All they have suggested here is that both
constructions, somebody in good faith made.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So then you win all the
time.
MR. HARRIS:  No.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There is no such thing as
ambiguity, because there is always a right answer.
MR. HARRIS:  As this Court has said in the
rule of lenity context, there can be situations where a
statute isn't clear. A judge at the end --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It sounds like you really
are advocating the "insolubly ambiguous" standard,
that's what you're saying.  Unless you have to throw up
your hands at the end and you say, we can't figure out
which one this means, there is no correct
interpretation, unless that's the case, then the patent
is valid.
MR. HARRIS:  The premise of Markman is that
in most, if not all, cases or many, many, many cases
where there is going to be real substantial disagreement
between two parties, good faith disagreement where each
side is supported by its reading of the materials,
nevertheless, the court can come to an answer and should
come to an answer.
I just want to mention quickly, this Court
has had several cases where words appeared to be
ambiguous on its face and yet the Court didn't have the
trouble of applying them and interpreting them in the
patent context.
Markman was a case about the word
"inventory."  "Inventory" on its surface could mean
either accounts receivable or the actual stuff.  In the
Yeomans case, the word was "manufacture."  Does
"manufacture" mean the result or does it mean the
process?
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, was the Federal
Circuit wrong when it said the test should be insolubly
ambiguous?  Was that wrong or not?
MR. HARRIS:  If "insolubly" means applying
the standard tools of claim construction, then it's
correct to say that that is what's required.  But that
term, I think by some district courts, I'll acknowledge,
may be misinterpreted to mean as long as we can come up
with anything, and it makes it sound as if it's not
necessary to actually tie it back to the language of the
patent.
If the court is doing it the correct way
that Markman prescribes, looking at all the patent
materials and the prosecution history, if it can come to
an answer, then we would agree that answer -- that the
patent is definite.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you agree with your
adversary that the prosecution history is that at the
time the patent was issued and not on re-examination or
anything else subsequent?
MR. HARRIS:  I think in this case it comes
out the same.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no.  I didn't ask
that question.
MR. HARRIS:  No, I think that the
prosecution history later also can count.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Explain that.  Because
he says, and it seems logical, that you're going to
stifle inventiveness if people can't, once the patent is
issued, know how to get around it.
MR. HARRIS:  Well, let me clarify what I
mean by that.  If evidence is introduced at a later
stage during -- in, say, in re-examination, some of that
evidence may be, it may be -- a court may be able to
consider that at a later time as being relevant.
If I can finish the question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You mean the answer?
MR. HARRIS:  Yes, the answer.
If the court -- in other words, if evidence,
as here, was introduced at re-examination about what
skilled artisans knew at the time, the mere fact that it
was introduced at a later stage is not a problem.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MR. HARRIS:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Gannon.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court:
If I'll start with a question that the
Chief Justice asked.  You’ve already recited the standard
that we support here, which is that a patent claims is
sufficiently definite under paragraph 2,if a person of
ordinary skill in the art would reasonably understand
the scope of the claim.  And I understand Petitioner's
submission to be a dispute about what happens if there
are two potentially reasonable constructions at the end
of the Markman claim process.
And we think that if there are two
constructions that are of nearly equal persuasiveness,
then that would be ambiguous.  But if one construction
is appreciably better, then that is good enough without
having to take the second step of saying that the second
best construction that's not as good and appreciably not
as good IS -- is also unreasonable.  We think that
that's not the way this Court or judges --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What worries me about that,
which is certainly attractive, what you just say, is
that lawyers will come up with all kinds of experts, you
know.  And quite often, if this situation ever arises,
and I don't know if it really ever does, it could
reflect a difference of opinion among scientists.  I
mean, you could have those who followed the phlogiston
theory of fire.  You could have those who
follow the oxygen theory of fire.  All we have to do is
update that, and you could find different experts who
would have different opinions while all agreeing that it
is absolutely clear.
I doubt that the Patent Office will very
often find that problem arising.  And if it does, why
not just say, forget about it?  As long as you can say
reasonable experts can clearly -- you know, what you
just said -- that's the end of it.  And we'll tell you
what to do later, when we really find the problem or you
tell us what to do.  I mean, I'm having a problem about
it, and I'm explaining what my problem was.
MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that the question
is what does it mean when the Court has demanded
reasonable clarity or reasonable certainty, and that's
the standard that we read in this Court's cases on
definiteness.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Can't we just stop there?
I mean, do we really have to go into this theoretical
dispute between the two scientists, who have opposite
theories of --
MR. GANNON:  Well, I don't think it's a
dispute between two scientists with opposite theories.
The question of what a person of ordinary skill in the
art would think, I think that a person of ordinary skill
in the art is a hypothetical legal construct, like the
reasonable person from tort law.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  When do we ever decide a
case in which we would not say that our result is
appreciably better than the result we reject?
MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that there are
times when the Court would recognize that it's an
authentically closer question.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's still close, but
not appreciably better.  If it's not appreciably better,
we would have to say it's a draw.
MR. GANNON:  I don't think that the Court
has a unified field theory of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I think the test
you're giving us is not much of a test, it really isn't.
It seems to me it says so long as there is a right
answer, everything else is wrong.
MR. GANNON:  No, I think it says that as
long as the right answer is appreciably better than the
second best answer, that you do not have to take the
second step of having to declare --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How big is appreciable?
MR. GANNON:  I don't --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't know.
MR. GANNON:  I think it's difficult to put a
mathematical precise -- a mathematically precise number
on it.
JUSTICE ALITO:  That's the whole problem
with what you're -- with what you're saying.  I have no
idea what "appreciable" means.  Let's say we have a 0 to 1 --
MR. GANNON:  Something more like 60/40 than
52/48.  And I think in general the Court recognizes the
difficulty of that type of mathematical precision in
applying tests like what it means to be clear and
convincing.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Usually when we ask whether
something is reasonable, we have in mind this reasonable
person and the set of circumstances in which the
reasonable person is going to act.  So in torts, the
reasonable person is going to engage in an activity that
has some benefits but also has some risks; what would
that person do in that situation.
Now, here you're saying what would the
reasonable skilled artisan do in what situation?  What
is this person doing, setting out to build the device?
What --
MR. GANNON:  They are trying to understand
the scope of the claim.  And so, and I -- I do think
it's important here to recognize that there are two
different questions that are getting conflated in some
of the discussion.  I think that with respect to
definiteness under paragraph 2, as the court of appeals
majority recognized, that this is -- in this case the
question is whether the claim clearly states that it
requires the electrodes to be arranged in such a fashion
that they will have the effect of detecting
substantially equal EMG signals at the electrodes.  It's
not with downstream circuitry, which is what Petitioner
suggested in the opening brief.  In Petitioner's reply
brief they've suggested they could use some sort of
protective sleeve on the electrodes, but that wouldn't
be consistent with the parts of the limitations that say
that there needs to be physical and electrical contact
with the electrodes.
And the majority recognize that there are
multiple variables that come into play here, the
spacing, the materials, the separation, as my, my
co-counsel was just explaining, and -- but the
disagreement between the majority and the concurring
opinion here is just in whether the functional
limitation inheres in the phrase "spaced relationship"
taken in isolation or whether it can be read from the
rest of the claim as a whole.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you say
something like "appreciably better," that's a term that
may acquire meaning over time.  Just like
reasonableness, we get a good sense of what it means.
Is it your sense that the Federal Circuit has been
applying its test in this case?  I mean, not in this
case but in a series of cases that is -- it is close to
appreciably better or is it something quite different?
MR. GANNON:  Well, we do acknowledge that
the phrases that the Federal Circuit has used about
"insolubly ambiguous" and "amenable to construction" are
subject to be -- to be overread and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, nobody
likes those phrases --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- subject to being read,
not overread.
MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that they -- that
they could cause mischief if applied in isolation.  And
we haven't taken a position on every case that the court
of appeals has applied these standards in, and I don't
think that the court of appeals was intending a marked
departure from this Court's overarching --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are there cases where
there are two reasonable constructions, but both would
be patentable?
MR. GANNON:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would that satisfy the
specificity requirement of the statute?
MR. GANNON:  I think that we are arguing now
about when the second best construction ceases to be a
reasonable one, I think.  And I think that if the Court
wants to think of just whether there is a good enough
construction such that there is reasonable clarity as
required under United Carbon and in the Minerals
Separation case where the Court said that the certainty
that's required is not greater than is reasonable.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What do you think of this
Chevron analogy, Mr. Gannon?  Because sometimes we do
say something close to it's a tie.  We say there are a
couple of reasonable constructions or a number of
reasonable constructions.  We could pick one, we think
it might be better, but it's all close enough that we
don't think we ought to pick one.  So similarly, it's
all close enough that the definiteness requirement has
not been met.  Is that a good analogy?
MR. GANNON:  I -- I think that that would
probably -- we think that the sorts of constructions
that would be reasonable under Chevron that the agency
could take as a second best construction probably aren't
sufficient to be the definite construction here.  And so
I -- I don't think it's a close analogy because we don't
think that anyone is seeking that type of deference to
another decisionmaker as --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  I'm not sure I quite
got that.  It's just that anything that would flunk
Chevron step one and would go on to Chevron step two,
you would say that that kind of ambiguity, the kind of
ambiguity --
MR. GANNON:  No.  I --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that would get you to
Chevron step two --
MR. GANNON:  I don't think so.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- is also the kind of
ambiguity that would fail to satisfy the definiteness --
MR. GANNON:  No.  And I'm sorry if I wasn't
clear about this before.  I was trying to say that in a
60/40 situation that I said would be adequate here, such
that the second construction did not prevent there from
being sufficient clarity, I think that we would think
that an agency would be entitled to choose the 40
percent option.  But we don't think that that would be
-- that that would prevent the 60 percent option from
being good enough in the context required here.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The Federal Circuit
seems to say that if there's two reasonable
constructions and one would make the patent valid, I
think this goes to Justice Kennedy's question, that
they're obligated to pick the one that makes the patent
valid.
MR. GANNON:  The case, I think -- I believe
the case that's being talked about there is cited in the
Exxon opinion.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Uh-huh.
MR. GANNON:  And that talks about when there
are two equally-plausible constructions.  I think that
that probably is the -- the knife edge of insolubly
ambiguous.  And there, the Federal Circuit suggested
that -- that, as Justice Scalia was -- was saying
before, that -- that because there would be a decision
rule, that you would pick the construction that would
save the patent, that that would be okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that right?
MR. GANNON:  I don't think that that allows
for sufficient clarity.  We believe that if there are
two constructions --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So they're wrong in that
as well.
MR. GANNON:  In that particular statement
of -- of the rule, yes.  We do think, however, that
there is a distinction between the -- that the
presumption of patent validity does play a role here.
It doesn't change the standard, but it -- it does -- it
does play a role in indicating that, as the PTO has
recognized, that courts will do more to save a patent
than the PTO does when it's examining one.  And I
would -- I would say that we also disagree with the
notion --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How can that be if it's
the same test?
MR. GANNON:  Well, it's -- the overarching
question is, is the same of whether a person skilled in
the art would reasonably understand the scope of the
claim, but --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's the same test
at both levels.
MR. GANNON:  It's -- it's not the same test
that the PTO applies in examination proceedings because
it uses a slightly different threshold of ambiguity.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you finished
with your answer?
MR. GANNON:  I could give an explanation of
why.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can you do it in a
sentence?
MR. GANNON:  I could say that it involves
the different circumstances there that include the
different record, the different burden of proof, the
lack of adversarial presentation there, and mostly
critically, the fact that it's easier to amend the
claims before the patent has been issued.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Four minutes, Mr. Vandenberg.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN D. VANDENBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. VANDENBERG:  Thank you.  I think the --
the essential points here are, first, the emphatic
language that Congress chose, and then thinking about
ambiguous claims.  There is no legitimate need for
ambiguous claims.  There is a strong economic incentive
for patent attorneys to draft ambiguous claims, not to
put all their eggs in that basket.  They want some clear
claims in case some copyist comes along, but they want
ambiguous claims so they can -- their client can treat
it as a nose of wax later, as happened here.  That is
well established in the patent bar, that there is this
strong economic incentive.  But patent attorneys have
ample tools to avoid ambiguous claims if this Court
tells them that it will no longer be permitted.  That --
that is the key here, is that there's a strong economic
incentive.  The patent attorney and the inventor are in
the best position to avoid the ambiguity that Congress
prohibits and therefore, the problem is, the Federal
Circuit has blessed ambiguity with its test.  And in
order to stop all of the problems that the amici have
pointed out that are caused by ambiguous claims, we
submit this Court needs to be clear and go back to
United Carbon and General Electric and to the statutory
text and be clear that ambiguity is simply not
permitted.
In terms of how the Federal Circuit ruled
here, and we point to the majority's opinion at petition
appendix 15(a), the court, the majority, definitely
applied the insolubly ambiguous test.  They said,
"Because the term was amenable to construction,
indefiniteness here would require a showing that a
person of ordinary skill would find spaced relationship
to be insolubly ambiguous."  And therefore, if the Court
rejects that test, we submit, at the very least, the
Court cannot affirm the judgment below on that basis.
But more importantly --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the Federal Circuit
said something -- I'm looking at the petition appendix
at 20(a) -- that sounded very close to what the
government standard is.  It said, "Sufficiently" --
"that the claim provides parameters sufficient for a
skilled artisan to understand the bounds of spaced
relationship."  That sounds very close to what the
government says and it isn't -- they don't say anything
about insoluble in -- in that statement.
MR. VANDENBERG:  It is true that here in
some of their cases, the court will -- the Federal
Circuit will use language like that saying that one
could have understood.  However, it's clear they were
not applying the type of test that United Carbon and
General Electric required.  They did not even consider
whether the person of skill in the art may have read the
claim the different way.
And in terms of the two different claim
scopes, we would simply invite the Court's attention
back to our reply brief at page 20, which explained the
different claim scopes.  We think the government
misunderstood the point, and therefore, in the reply, we
amplified it some more.
But as -- as I said, the Court at the very
least should not affirm.  But we think it's important
here for the Court to create another concrete guide
post.  In KSR and Bilski, this Court provided a huge
service to the patent bar in applying the correct law to
an actual patent claim, creating concrete guide posts
for Section 101 and 103.  Well, the patent bar and the
trial courts need another concrete guide post if
applying the correct law of Section 112, paragraph 2 to
this particular claim.
If there are no further questions, thank
you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
