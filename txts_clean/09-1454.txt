CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

and 09-1478, Alford v. Greene.
General Kroger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. KROGER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KROGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In Pearson v. Callahan, this Court gave the
lower Federal courts discretionary power to decide
substantive questions of constitutional law in qualified
immunity cases in order to further the development of
constitutional precedent. If it is valuable for the
lower courts to decide these cases, then it is essential
that this Court be able to review those decisions in
order to ensure that they are accurate. For this
reason, the case is justiciable and should be reviewed
on the merits.
Turning to the merits of this case, the
Court of Appeals held --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not so fast.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, there are two
issues here, and I hope we do get to th substance. Can
you tell me Camreta's current occupation? Does the
record establish that? Does the record tell us what
Camreta is doing now? Is --
MR. KROGER: The record does not, Your
Honor, because the mootness issue was raised relatively
late in the proceedings, but I'm aware of what his
current occupation is.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is?
MR. KROGER: He is a child protective
services worker with the Oregon Department of Human
Services.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What I was about to ask is
this: I can agree with you that -- that where there is
a -- a determination on the merits, it should be
reviewable, but could still disagree that it's
reviewable where the requirements for Article III are
not met; that is, where there is really no justiciable
controversy between the parties.
What -- what is the interest of the -- of
the parties who were victorious here?
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the interest of Mr.
Camreta is the ongoing harm he has in his job. Under
the Ninth Circuit's decision, he is forced to either
forgo a regular and recurring duty of his job, which is
to interview potential child victims in school, or to
face liability for doing so.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would he face
liability? Because he didn't have the opportunity to
challenge that decision, the Fourth Amendment decision;
therefore, it would have no preclusive effect on him. A
party who doesn't have the -- if there are alternative
holdings and you lose on one, win on the other, you're
not precluded by the loss because you didn't have an
opportunity to raise it on appeal. So why would Camreta
be precluded? Why would he face punitive damages as
you're suggesting?
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit
opinion does apply to Mr. Camreta. The court
specifically advised Mr. Camreta and others in his
position that they are on notice that in-school
interviews of students that require a seizure require a
warrant, and, thus, the Ninth Circuit decision does have
precedential effect and impacts Mr. Camreta.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But it takes --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It takes two to tango, and
a case or controversy requires somebody on the other
side who cares a fig about the outcome. And here, S.G.,
who was the -- the young woman affected in the case, has
moved to another State and -- making it virtually
certain that she'll never confront this situation again.
She doesn't care what the result of this thing is.
Besides which, I think she's, what, 17 years old or so
now? It's impossible that she will be confronted with
the same situation.
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I disagree that
S.G. has no ongoing concrete stake in the outcome of
this case. In footnote 20 of the Respondent's brief on
page 33, the Respondent notes that they have filed a
motion in the United States district court to bring
their Fourth Amendment claim against Deschutes County, a
potential party that has no qualified immunity as a
defense. And, obviously, the legal viability of that --
that claim against Deschutes County will depend very
much on the ruling on the merits of this Court.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is a Monell claim,
and it's -- and the district court has held its ruling,
I take it, in abeyance pending -- a ruling for
reinstatement of that claim, pending our decision here?
MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.
The district court ruled that it was premature until
these proceedings were concluded.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why isn't the
answer, then, that that's the right case to take up?
Because in this case, we have a plaintiff who is not
going to be confronted with this situation again and who
has put herself out of the running for damages because
she didn't -- she didn't challenge the qualified
immunity ruling. So she has no stake in any monetary
relief from this claim. She has no continuing -- the --
what has happened to her, happened to her at age 9, will
never happen again now that she's past 18.
So she hasn't -- if she came to court today
with her case as an 18-year-old, she would have no case
or controversy. It just seems like the whole case has
evaporated. She has no claim. She did have a claim
for -- for money damages, but she has relinquished that.
So, what -- what genuine controversy is before us?
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the controversy
remains the Fourth Amendment claim, which is the
Respondent is seeking to pursue in the United States
district court and that gives the Respondent here a
direct financial stake in the viability of their Fourth
Amendment argument, and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Isn't
that -- isn't that the -- the county's claim? How
Camreta does his job doesn't -- that claim doesn't
belong to him; it belongs to the entity who is telling
him how to do his job. And so why don't we go back to
Justice Ginsburg's question of why isn't the Monell
situation the proper case? Because there, it's the
party interested in how its officers will do their job
at its directive. It has the case and controversy at
issue, not S.G.
Right now, she's never going to be
investigated again. She's in another State. I
understand that she doesn't even ever want to return to
Oregon for, probably, fairly good reasons, at least from
her perspective. So, again, why isn't this the
interests of the county, not -- not the interests of the
officer?
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, in Arizonans v.
Arizona, the Court recognized that the employee in that
case had an interest in how she was able to conduct her
job. The Court decided that the case was -- was moot
because she had resigned from her position with the
State. But there was no objection to -- to her standing
because she was a public employee that wanted to perform
her job in a particular way because she was required to
under State law, and here --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: She was the plaintiff.
In Arizona, we were talking about whether a plaintiff
still had a viable claim, right?
MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KAGAN: General Kroger, I don't
think that the question here is really a standing
question; it's really whether there is a controversy
between this particular plaintiff and this particular
defendant such that a judgment in this case would
actually affect the legal relationship between the two,
between the particular plaintiff and the particular
defendant.
So how would it do that? How would a legal
judgment in this case affect the legal relationship
between this plaintiff and this defendant?
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the -- the -- Mr.
Camreta remains a party below, and it's possible that
the Court's rulings on the Fourth Amendment merits may
impact the Fourteenth Amendment claims that are being
made against Mr. Camreta that are alive and in
controversy below.
Moreover, this case, even if one strips out
the ongoing motion that's been made in the district
court, resembles in all material respects Erie v.
Pap's A.M., where the Court found that there was
standing to bring the case and it was not moot. And so,
there does seem to be an active case or controversy that
is equivalent to that that was present in Erie v.
Pap's A.M.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How does it affect the
Fourteenth Amendment? There's a Fourteenth Amendment
claim pending below?
MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And what's the substance of
that?
MR. KROGER: It is a claim of Mrs. Greene to
interference with familial rights as a result of certain
actions by Mr. Camreta and other defendants.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that didn't have to
do with the school search -- the school seizure?
MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and this case
presents the question about was this unreasonable? That
-- what's left in the case has to do with the mother's
claim, and it has to do with putting the girls in
custody, right?
MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.
So the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if we were to
hold this case was moot, what would -- what do you think
the appropriate disposition of the case would be?
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I believe if the
Court determined that this case was moot, the -- the
appropriate remedy would be pursuant to Munson where --
to vacate the Ninth Circuit decision.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you don't really
want that, because the Ninth Circuit granted qualified
immunity. What would be -- what would we be vacating?
They haven't rendered a judgment on the search warrant
issue.
MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.
What -- what I think the appropriate remedy for the
Court would be would be to effectively --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Vacate the opinion.
MR. KROGER: -- vacate the opinion or
decision on the Fourth Amendment claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That would make you happy,
won't it? Won't that make you happy?
MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the --
I think the only difficulty with that as a -- as a
outcome of the case is it undercuts the logic of the
Pearson decision.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't just do
that. Is -- is Mr. Camreta in any more comfortable
position when he knows that the Ninth -- what the Ninth
Circuit thinks on this issue and he just has to wait
until there's another case when they can impose the view
that they've already spelled out? I know as a technical
matter it's not binding, but if you're Camreta, do you
say, well, the Supreme Court vacated that decision, so I
can go ahead and do this again and not have to worry
about personal liability?
MR. KROGER: You're correct, Your Honor. It
would place Mr. Camreta and other child protective
services workers in the Ninth Circuit in a very --
JUSTICE SCALIA: There are different panels
on the Ninth Circuit, aren't there?
MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and they don't all
hold the same thing, fortunately, do they?
(Laughter.)
MR. KROGER: They do they do not, Your
Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're supposed to
file circuit -- follow circuit precedent, aren't they?
MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But an opinion that is
vacated is not circuit precedent, is it?
MR. KROGER: It is not, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Camreta would be
protected. He would presumably still be entitled to
qualified immunity because a vacated alternative holding
certainly could not really establish something, I would
assume. But municipalities, if they continue to
participate in -- in questioning of this nature, would
not be protected; isn't that right?
MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened in --
what -- what has Oregon done in response to this Ninth
Circuit decision? Before it said that the caseworkers
could have this kind of interview with the -- the child
where there was a suspicion of abuse. Was there any
change in practice in Oregon in response to the Ninth
Circuit's decision?
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, that is not in the
record, but I would happy -- be happy to respond. The
State of Oregon provided legal advice advising child
protective services workers to attempt to avoid anything
that would be a seizure in a school and, in cases where
there would pose no risk of danger to the children, to
seek consent of -- of a parent before conducting an
interview. Nevertheless, that legal advice puts a
significant burden on the child protective services
workers to -- to do their utmost to protect Oregon's
children.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the merits --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- do you think that
the same approach you're following here would apply if
the investigation focused on the student rather than a
third party? Would in those cases a warrant have to be
obtained?
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I think in -- in
those cases, because parental consent is a viable
alternative where the allegation is a child is being
abused by another child --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, not another
child. It could be anything. We think the child is,
you know, selling drugs, obviously not a 7-year-old, but
someone else in the school is involved in legal
activity, him- or herself.
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I believe the --
the child abuse context is somewhat unique in that there
are very few ways to investigate properly child abuse
without speaking to the only witness that's typically
available in the case, and that is the child.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you think
it would be a different rule if we're talking about some
other criminal activity? The father's selling drugs,
and you think the child might have some evidence or at
least be willing to talk about that. Do you need
anything other than reasonableness in that case?
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, it would be the
same reasonableness standard that would apply, but I
think the courts might reach different conclusions about
what would be reasonable in those circumstances.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on -- we're getting
to the merits. Do you agree that search -- strike
that -- that seizure under the Fourth Amendment is the
relevant category here?
MR. KROGER: Absolutely, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You agree that the child
was -- was seized?
MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor, we concede
that the child was seized.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what happens if
the teacher tells -- the student is misbehaving on the
playground: Go back in the classroom. You can't -- you
sit there by yourself. You can't be part of recess.
Is that a seizure?
MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, I -- I disagree
that that would be a seizure, because --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What made this a seizure?
The fact that it wasn't a teacher?
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the reason we
conceded the issue of seizure is we are here on -- on
summary judgment, and we took the facts as alleged,
which involved transporting the student inside the
school.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I'm -- I'm
asking for your view of the proper category to apply in
these cases, and if it is a seizure, then -- then it's
just a question of reasonableness, and we'd look at all
the circumstances.
MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.
Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the
balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Kruger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
A number of the questions this morning have
focused on the question whether a live case or
controversy remains because Respondent has chosen not to
challenge the Ninth Circuit's qualified immunity ruling
and so purportedly has no continuing stake in the
resolution of this controversy. We think that that's
not correct for the reasons General Kroger has given,
but it's also not an irreducible minimum of this Court's
jurisdiction to correct the mistake that the Ninth
Circuit made in this case. I think, too --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- did she --
did she -- let's go back one step. Does she have any
viable claim now? This is not capable of repetition,
evasive of review?
MS. KRUGER: Well, two responses, Justice
Ginsburg. First, as General Kroger mentioned, she has a
continuing interest in how this Court resolves this
controversy because of her attempt to bring the same
Fourth Amendment claim against Deschutes County. But
setting that aside, this Court hasn't universally
required that as a prerequisite to exercising its
jurisdiction. I think there are two examples that help
to illustrate the point.
The first is the City of Erie v. Pap's A.M.
case, in which this Court decided to review a State
court injunction entered in favor of a plaintiff who no
longer had what we would think of as an Article III
stake in the case by the time the case reached this
Court.
The plaintiff in that case had left the nude
dancing business and had affirmatively stated they had
no intention to return. The Court, nevertheless,
reached the merits of the State court decision that was
on review because to do otherwise would be to saddle the
City of Erie with an ongoing injury. In the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: There was a dissent in that
case, wasn't there?
MS. KRUGER: There was indeed a dissent in
that case. But I would note that there was also --
(Laughter.)
MS. KRUGER: -- a dissent from the denial of
cert in Bunting v. Mellen, in which very much the same
situation was presented. The cadets who brought the
challenge to the VMI supper prayer that was at issue in
that case had graduated from VMI by the time this case
reached this Court. And I think, as you quite properly
noted in your dissent from denial of review in that
case, for this Court to essentially insulate those types
of constitutional rulings from review would be to
undermine the very purposes for which this Court --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kruger, how does this --
this situation, the qualified immunity situation, differ
from a wide variety of other situations in which we
might not be able to get to the underlying
constitutional ruling?
For example, in any case where there's a
constitutional ruling but also a harmless error ruling,
or in a Sixth Amendment case where there are standards
about ineffective assistance of counsel but then a
finding that there's no prejudice. In all of those
kinds of cases, the underlying substantive ruling might
be insulated from our review. How would you say that
the qualified immunity situation is different and how
would you be able to cabin this rule?
MS. KRUGER: The reason we think the
qualified immunity situation is different, it presents a
set of exceptional circumstances that weren't an
exception to the usual prudential rule, is because the
qualified immunity situation is one in which this Court
has encouraged courts to undertake these kinds of
constitutional rulings for the purpose of changing the
legal landscape going forward, for the very purpose of
establishing the law so that the -- that qualified
immunity doesn't remain perpetually available to
officials even though they are engaging in conduct --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, presumably, in every
case --
MS. KRUGER: -- that has been found
unconstitutional.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Excuse me. Presumably, in
every case in which a court does these paired rulings,
if you will -- it doesn't just say that the error was
harmless, but says that there was an error -- there's a
purpose to clarify the law. How is this different, once
again?
MS. KRUGER: I think that in this situation
what we have is not just a preview of how the court of
appeals would decide the case subsequently in a case in
which it was actually necessary to reach a certain
judgment. What we have is a decision that changes the
legal landscape going forward. It establishes the law
such that qualified immunity will not be available in
the next case. And it means that people like Petitioner
Camreta and other child protective services workers who
are doing their best to protect children from abuse are
now on notice that if they attempt to detain temporarily
a child in school for the purposes of trying to confirm
or dispel a reasonable suspicion of child abuse without
a warrant supported by probable cause, that they will
invite lawsuits that would put them on the line for
personal monetary damages.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that wouldn't be the
case if the opinion were vacated --
MS. KRUGER: That's true.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- under Munsingwear?
MS. KRUGER: That's true, Justice Scalia,
and I think that if that's the disposition that this
Court thinks is appropriate, we would be certainly be
happier with that than a rule that says --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be --
MS. KRUGER: -- an incorrect constitutional
ruling.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be a
partial vacatur, right? The Court's done that before,
hasn't it, where we vacate part of a decision under
Munsingwear?
MS. KRUGER: That's correct, Mr. Chief
Justice. But I would note that a vacatur rule would
come with certain costs that I think this Court should
keep in mind as it decides what the appropriate
disposition of this case is.
The reason that Respondent has so vigorously
objected to that disposition is because it is
inconsistent in some ways with the very reason for
permitting courts of appeals to undertake this kind of
constitutional determination in the first place. It
undermines the -- the development of the constitutional
law if this Court simply wipes the -- the slate clean
but doesn't exercise its own authority to clarify the
law by correcting what the Ninth Circuit has done. And
I think, as the Chief Justice has quite correctly
pointed out, it also does nothing to dispel the cloud of
uncertainty that hangs over individuals within the
territorial jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not so
sure he was correct. The --
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's vacated, it
indicates that there's no established law on that
question, and it seems to me Camreta would be free to do
what he considered appropriate under the circumstances,
and if somebody tries to impose personal liability on
him, it seems he has an even stronger case than he might
have before.
MS. KRUGER: I think that's correct, Mr.
Chief Justice, and I think for that reason we would not
object to that disposition in this case. We would just
observe that that disposition is one that does not sit
particularly comfortably with the reasoning of Pearson
and the line of cases that comes before it, that
recognizes that the reason why we encourage courts of
appeals to undertake these determinations in the first
place is to promote the development of constitutional
law and to ensure that the law doesn't remain not
clearly established in perpetuity.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me it would
affect Camreta's behavior and that of other child
protective officers. The lawyer would explain: Now,
legally this is not binding; it just never happened.
But three judges of the court of appeals in a reasoned
decision have explained why this is contrary to the
Constitution, and it would seem to me that any
conscientious law enforcement officer would -- would
take that seriously into account.
MS. KRUGER: I think that's absolutely
right, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? What's the test?
Isn't the test clearly established law?
MS. KRUGER: That's right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Would this be clearly
established law under any -- any conceivable
interpretation of that?
MS. KRUGER: I think it's -- it's true that
if this Court were to vacate the Ninth Circuit's
constitutional ruling, Mr. Camreta and others who are
similarly situated wouldn't face the very significant
concrete prospective effect of this decision, which is
to strip them of qualified immunity in future cases.
They would be able to argue, as you're suggesting, that
the law is not clearly established. At the same time --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we told them --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You have very limited
time. Could you -- could you go to the merits of the
Fourth Amendment question and give us the Government's
position on that?
MS. KRUGER: Certainly, Justice Ginsburg.
The Ninth Circuit in this case held that the temporary
detention of a child in school to confirm or dispel
suspicions that that child is being abused is
unconstitutional unless the questioning officials have a
warrant, probable cause, or parental consent. We think
each of those requirements is unjustified as a matter of
Fourth Amendment law and imposes a serious burden on the
conduct of the -- of the government at the initial
stages of a child abuse investigation. As --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, would -- I'm
interrupting you only for a quick reason. What's the
test? Is it a question of whether the seizure is
reasonable or not?
MS. KRUGER: That's correct, Justice
Sotomayor. The question is reasonableness.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So -- so
that would be your proposed test. If we were to say you
don't need any of those three things right now, where
would that leave us or leave the courts below on
determining whether what happened here was reasonable or
not? Meaning, what if a child is called in and says, I
don't want to talk to you without my mom; and they
continue to speak to the child? Is that reasonable?
MS. KRUGER: I think that the answer is that
would go to the -- the question of the manner in which
the -- the interview is conducted, as opposed to whether
it's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do we --
MS. KRUGER: -- reasonable at its inception.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we develop the
law, or how do we help develop the law in this case if
we answer your question but leave unanswered with no
parameters, any idea -- because we have no set of facts;
no one's going to review that question -- of what is
reasonable in this context?
MS. KRUGER: Well, the question that the
Ninth Circuit answered in this case was a question that
concerns the justification for the interview at its
inception. The Ninth Circuit said a warrant, probable
cause, or parental consent is required from the very
outset. That would be true whether an interview lasted
hours or 10 minutes, whether the child was responsive,
whether the child wasn't.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- you see, that's
the problem with taking up a case with no case in
controversy, because what do we do? We don't remand for
them to reach the second question, which is really the
one that law enforcement needs some help on.
MS. KRUGER: Well, I -- I would disagree
with that proposition. I think law enforcement very
much needs help on the questions the Ninth Circuit
actually decided because the warrant or probable cause
requirement is one that has a very significant effect on
the way that they carry out their very important
business in this area.
If the Court has no further questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Kubitschek.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLYN A. KUBITSCHEK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Thank you. Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
There is no case or controversy between S.G.
and the Petitioners. That ended when --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then why are you --
why are you here?
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not
challenging the qualified immunity ruling?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Precisely.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yet, you have --
yet, you have -- why didn't you just go away?
(Laughter.)
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Mr. Chief Justice, we are
not here voluntarily.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know that.
But why --
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I do know that. But
on the other hand, you had no -- you could have filed a
paper saying we have no continuing interest in the case,
but you haven't done that. You've fought the legal
issues on the merits in -- in an area where it's been
suggested you don't have a stake.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: We -- S.G. does not have a
legally cognizable stake, Your Honor. She won a moral
victory when she obtained a ruling in her favor on the
Fourth Amendment claim in the Ninth Circuit, but as this
Court said in Hewitt v. Helms, a moral victory is no
victory at all, but --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have
objection if we entered a Munsingwear order vacating the
decision of the Ninth Circuit on the merits of the
dispute?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, the -- we
would submit that the Munsingwear test would not apply
in this case because Munsingwear, which permitted
vacating a decision when it became moot, talked about
decisions which become moot through happenstance, and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, again --
MS. KUBITSCHEK: -- the reason for that is
because of preclusion. I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Again, I
get to the question, why do you care? Why do you care
whether we vacate the -- the order or not? Your
position is your client has no continuing interest in
the case.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- our client has no
legally binding, legally cognizable interest in the
case. She has an interest in protecting her moral
victory, as do -- and in the issue, as do the many amici
who filed briefs on her behalf.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: She's asserting the
interests of other children who would be in the
situation that she was once in, but no longer; but we
have said the plaintiff herself must have a live
controversy, and there was no class action here.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that is correct,
Justice Ginsburg. She does not have an interest, and
the case is moot.
JUSTICE ALITO: But you want to have the
Fourth Amendment decision preserved and have it govern
an enormous chunk of the country so that all the States
in the Ninth Circuit have to comply with it, and anybody
-- any individual officer who doesn't comply with it
would do so on pain of personal liability, but you don't
want that ground-breaking decision to be subject to
review by this Court on the merits. Is that a summary
of what you want? Does that make any sense?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Your Honor, the -- the case
-- if the case is truly as important to other employees
of the States in -- within the confines of the Ninth
Circuit, it will arise again, and this Court will have
the opportunity to decide the issue again between
parties who have a live stake in the issue; or it will
arise in another circuit, and it will present a live
controversy between parties who have a stake.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you want us -- so
Munsingwear. You don't want us just to leave it sitting
because there's no controversy; you want us to erase
that holding below, right?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: No, Your Honor, we would
not ask the holding below be erased. That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then the
answer you just gave doesn't make any sense. You say it
can -- you know, it can arise again. That would be the
answer of someone who wants us to eliminate the holding
here: Don't worry; it will come up again in a context
where, on appeal, somebody will have an interest in
arguing to -- to sustain it, but that interest doesn't
exist here. That's the argument you're making, but
that's the argument of someone --
MS. KUBITSCHEK: I'm sorry --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- who wants us to
Munsingwear.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: I'm sorry, Your Honor, I
misspoke. It will come up -- if it is as -- if the
practice is as widespread as the Petitioners claim, it
will come up again in other circuits, and this Court
will have the opportunity to review it and --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but Justice Alito's
question was addressed to the Ninth Circuit. In the
Ninth Circuit, it's not going to come up again if we
assume that our public employees are going to be
law-abiding. They're bound by this in the Ninth
Circuit.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, I
guess that's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you -- and you want
them to be bound, and yet you say there's -- that the
case is moot. I just don't understand it.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, that
leads to the question of what exactly are they bound by?
And our reading of the court of appeals decision is not
nearly as broad as the Petitioners' reading. The court
of appeals said specifically our caseworkers and police
officers are always allowed to question children in a
protractive custodial setting with --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where are you reading in
the holding of the court of appeals? Because I was
under the impression that they did say there's only
three ways: One is you get a warrant; another is you
get parental consent; and a third is exigent
circumstances. I thought that was the -- the ruling of
law by the Ninth Circuit.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That was -- that was the
ruling as it applied to S.G. herself, Justice Ginsburg.
This was not a class action lawsuit, and the court was
deciding what happened to one 9-year-old child on
February 24th, 2003.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's see where
they -- I thought that, yes, the case is about a single
plaintiff; it's not a class action. But they're making
a rule of law. What does the Fourth Amendment require?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Okay. On page 1022, Your
Honor, it says: "We consider the relatively
straightforward question whether an in-school seizure
and interrogation of a suspected child abuse victim is
always permissible under the Fourth Amendment without
probable cause and a warrant or the equivalent of a
warrant." And the court -- and the court said: No, not
always and not in this case.
And if this Court does reach the merits
of -- of this case, we would ask this Court to uphold a
rule that -- stating that a protracted custodial
interview of a child by police and child welfare
investigators is presumptively unconstitutional unless
they have a warrant or court order or parental consent
or exigent circumstances.
JUSTICE ALITO: What is there in the Ninth
Circuit's opinion, which -- which generally requires a
warrant, to suggest that the length of the interrogation
was relevant to their decision? I mean, at least the
child protective services need to decide whether they
need a warrant before they begin the questioning, no
matter how long it's going to last.
Where does it say that the length is
relevant to the -- to the issue that they decided?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, the --
the length of the questioning has been historically
important to this Court's jurisprudence. It
distinguishes, for example, between a Terry stop and a
seizure. And this Court said, for example, in the
United States v. Place, that a 90-minute detention is --
falls out of the realm of a Terry stop and into the
realm of a seizure for which full Fourth Amendment
protections are required of a criminal suspect. And
this Court has also said, in Soldal v. Cook County, that
it would be anomalous if people who are not suspected of
any wrongdoing at all had fewer Fourth Amendment
protections than --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. It
seems like a very strange rule to me. You mean it's
okay for a child protection worker to just ask the child
passing in the hall, you know, has your -- or not
passing in the hall. Come into this room, I have a
question for you: Has your father been abusing you?
And if the child says yes, thank you, and the child
goes, then that's okay?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: We would --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Because it was a short
interview?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: The -- I didn't mean to --
that the length of the interview is the only factor,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: One of the other factors is
that the -- that the seizure is determined by the fact
that the police and child welfare worker removed the
child or removed any individual from the place where she
is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Take her into a
room. I see that.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: -- and bring her to another
place, and then --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But once they take her in a
room, it depends on how long the interview is; is that
right?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that goes to the
question of whether or not there was a seizure.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Whatever.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: In this case, it was
stipulated that there was a seizure.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking about rules
for the future; we're not talking about this case, and
you're asking us to adopt a rule for the future that
says if it's very brief, it's okay, but if it's longer
it isn't okay. Right? That's what you want us to
adopt?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that if -- if it
were very brief and the child was not removed from her
classroom --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, no. Removed.
There has been a seizure, but it's been a very brief
seizure, just as a Terry stop is a very brief seizure.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Our position would be that
because the -- of the importance of consent here to a
seizure, that the -- that there would need to be a court
order to remove a child from her classroom and to take
her to another room and then --
JUSTICE ALITO: On the issue --
MS. KUBITSCHEK: -- or parental consent.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're changing your
position: You need a court order, no matter how brief;
is that it?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: I think that has been our
position, and I'm sorry if I didn't make it clear.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, on the issue of
consent, do you read the Ninth Circuit's opinion as
having an age limit? Suppose that the child is, let's
say, 16 years old. Is the child at 16 incapable of
consenting to questioning?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, the way that we read
the Court of Appeals decision and the rule that we would
ask this Court to adopt, that is, seizure and for a
custodial interrogation is presumptively unreasonable
without parental consent or a court order leaves open
the possibility that there are, in fact, some children
who are of suitable age and discretion to knowingly make
a decision whether or not to talk to an armed police
officer and a caseworker without their parents having to
make it for them. But --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are you -- I
just want to make sure I understand your position.
Answering Justice Scalia's question: Child walks into
the room -- is taken out of their classroom, walks into
the room. The officer says: We've heard that your
mommy and daddy are doing some things to your private
parts; is that true? And the child says -- 9-year-old
child says: I wish somebody had asked me before. I'm
so afraid of my daddy. He does these horrible things to
Are you seriously suggesting that if the
police stay there for an hour debriefing that child as
to the circumstances of that situation, that that's a
seizure? It seems to me that what you --
MS. KUBITSCHEK: A seizure, yes, but that
would have exigent circumstances, and that would get it
out of the warrant requirement.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but what does that
have to do or change the police bringing a child into a
room and just asking the question? When does -- that's
what you seem to have said to Justice Scalia, which is
that the mere removal from the classroom is the -- the
defining feature of seizure. So it can't be that.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They don't know if
there's exigent circumstances until they ask the
question.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You got a stipulation
that there was a seizure, so --
MS. KUBITSCHEK: What? Yes, there was a
seizure.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was never any
argument that was not at issue in this case. Given that
there was seizure --
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That's -- that's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the question is: Is
it reasonable?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have you, in the -- many
of the questions have gone to leads, but this is
initially a social worker's investigation. And you
said, when stating what the Ninth Circuit's rule was,
that police are in combination with the caseworker.
Suppose we took out -- out of the picture.
He didn't utter a word in the interview. Suppose we
take the sheriff, deputy sheriff, out. The only one who
comes to the school and asks to talk to this child is
the caseworker from the department of health?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, it would depend on, I
think, the larger picture, whether or not there was
police entanglement, as this Court ruled in Ferguson v.
The City of Charleston. In this particular case, the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the information
elicited from the child is that she has been abused by
her father, then there is a likelihood that there will
be police interest in that.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, and this -- this
Court recognized also that possibility in Ferguson v.
The City of Charleston, that the -- the nurses at the
hospital would call child protective services, but
the -- the -- you have to look at it from the beginning,
and in this case, the case began when -- on
February 10th, when the police got involved.
The police did not report the matter to the
child protective investigator until 10 days later, and
then they went out together. Subsequently, the child
protective investigator testified before a grand jury as
part of the ongoing law enforcement investigation and,
in fact, when he was questioned at his deposition,
petitioner Alford said that his reason for being at the
school was for law enforcement purposes.
JUSTICE ALITO: But what is your answer to
Justice Ginsburg's question, suppose it was just
Mr. Camreta or suppose it was the school nurse, would
the answer be the same?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: No, it would not be the
same if it was the school nurse or Mr. Camreta. And
the -- the reason is that the school nurse is part of
the school administration, and the school has an
obligation and the authority under T.L.O. act and in
Earls to make rules and carry out procedures that will
protect the children of the school and promote learning,
and if the child comes --
JUSTICE ALITO: So if it was just
Mr. Camreta and he --
MS. KUBITSCHEK: If Mr. --
JUSTICE ALITO: -- and he taped the
conversation and then later turned it over to the -- to
the police if he discovered evidence of child abuse,
there would be no problem? Right?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: If Mr. Camreta came in from
the outside, he would not fall within the T.L.O. rule,
because in T.L.O. this Court said specifically that
their ruling does not apply to individuals such as
police officers who come from the outside in -- in order
to deal with situations that are not related to the
school, and nobody is saying that S.G. was abused while
she was at the school.
JUSTICE BREYER: Same circumstance. Was
there a seizure? No -- no professor -- no policeman?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: If -- if --
JUSTICE BREYER: School nurse?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: The school nurse?
JUSTICE BREYER: Seizure?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Probably not a seizure.
JUSTICE BREYER: And so, it's not a seizure
if exactly the same thing happens but there is no
outside person there, but it is a seizure if there's an
outside person?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: If the outside person comes
into the school --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the rule as to
whether there's a seizure?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That's one of the factors
to look at.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, whether there's
a seizure?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What makes it a
seizure? Go inside and speak to the principal, I saw
you push the child at recess. We want to find out who
was pushing you. Go inside and talk to the principal.
Seizure?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Your Honor, I believe that
it -- it would be considered a seizure, although that's
not our case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Everybody is going to stay
minutes after class, too much talking today. Seizure?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that, Your Honor,
it might be a seizure. Again, it's T.L.O. --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's what I need to
know, because I don't know see if there is no seizure,
how it could have been an unreasonable thing, if there
isn't even a seizure.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: If -- if the caseworker
comes to the school under circumstances where a child
would feel free to leave or --
JUSTICE BREYER: You're not free to leave
class.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, that's --
children -- this is correct, children have lesser
expectations of privacy, but when they are forcibly
taken out of class and moved to another location --
JUSTICE BREYER: Go to the principal's
office. Too much talking.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that would be --
Your Honor, if that is a seizure, it would fall within
T.L.O., precisely within T.L.O., whereas --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If you send her to the
school nurse, it's not a seizure, but if the school
doesn't have a nurse and it brings in a nurse from the
outside and say, you know, we think you have some
contagious disease, we would like you to speak to
this -- then it becomes a seizure?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, the
T.L.O. framework would certainly apply in that
situation, where you have a child who has a potentially
contagious disease, then the analysis you follow --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Contagious, it's just a
disease that's going to kill this child and nobody else,
okay?
(Laughter.)
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Your Honor, that certainly
also would fall within the T.L.O. --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: -- special needs exception.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So why doesn't it --
likewise, it's not a nurse, but it's a social worker
who's brought in to interrogate the child about
something else that is going to very much harm that
child, why is that any different?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, because
child welfare investigations are also harmful to
children. And when -- when a child is asked,
interrogated about whether or not her father touches her
inappropriately, that's not a neutral action. Whether
or not she has been abused that causes trauma to the
child --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It has nothing to do with
whether there's a seizure, nothing whatever to do with
whether there's a seizure.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: If -- if there --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The questions you ask after
the seizure don't make it a seizure or make it not a
seizure, do they?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: They -- they affect the
constitutionality of the interaction between the child
and the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't that go to the
question of the reasonableness of the scope of the
seizure? Don't we have Lidster and -- and other
jurisprudence that basically addresses this question and
says is this type of seizure or stop detention
reasonable?
And it's hard to swallow that if a police
officer asks a child are you being abused and the child
says, yes, I need help, it is nearly impossible to think
that that seizure is unreasonable. You're -- you're --
you're -- it may well be that 2 hours for a protesting
child would be, but isn't that all subject to a question
of reasonableness as to the scope of the seizure?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor,
because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: She's helping you, I think.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SCALIA: She's helping you, I think.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but that goes to the
reasonableness of the seizure. I was asking you about
whether there has been a seizure. Step one, has there
been a seizure? And you're saying that in a lot of
these situations there simply hasn't been a seizure.
Now, once there is a seizure, then we can
inquire to whether it's unreasonable or not. But -- but
those are two distinct questions, and -- and we've been
discussing the mere existence of a seizure. Now, true
in this case it was already conceded, but you're asking
us to adopt a rule for future cases, and we can't adopt
a rule for future cases until we know what we're talking
about when -- when -- when we talk about a seizure.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was not trying to
help you.
(Laughter.)
MS. KUBITSCHEK: I'm aware of that. But,
you know, that again is perhaps a good reason why this
Court should not reach the merits of the Fourth
Amendment question, because in this particular case it
was conceded that there was a seizure so early in the --
in the case that the normal development of facts which,
as Justice Scalia, you have pointed out, whether or not
there is a seizure is certainly dependent on the
individual facts of the encounter between the individual
child and the individual police officer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're --
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Those facts were not
developed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's your
argument, again, that we shouldn't reach the merits?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, do you agree
that if we vacate the court of appeals' decision on the
merits, that if Camreta had did exactly what he did in
this case again, that he would not face personal
liability?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: If you -- if you vacate the
decision on the merits --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Then that
cannot be used -- that cannot be used to establish that
there's clearly established law. And in the absence of
clearly established law, he cannot be found personally
liable?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that would be
correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if he did exactly
the same thing, he would still be entitled to qualified
immunity?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: He would still be entitled
to qualified immunity, but if this Court were to vacate,
this Court would be effectively be telling lower courts
that they should not follow the Pearson sequence ever
because if they -- if the lower court reaches a
constitutional issue and then rules that the defendant
has qualified immunity, which Pearson said that they
could do, that this Court would then say no, don't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not always. Not always.
Only when there is no longer a case in controversy.
In -- in many cases there will still be a case or
controversy.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It will be something that
could be replicated again in the future for some other
reason. It -- it isn't true that it will just eliminate
the whole purpose of our -- of our jurisprudence in this
area. In many cases the -- the decision below can be
appealed, and -- and we will rule on the -- on the
constitutional question.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Which is -- that's --
that's correct --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you moved away, I mean
if -- you know, it's a different situation.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: It -- it's a different
situation, but if they're in the situations where
individual defendants have qualified immunity, it has
been the procedure in this Court not only since Pearson
but really going all the way back to Siegert v. Gilley,
91, where the Court recommended that the lower courts
reach the constitutional issue -- in Siegert this Court
said that they can. In County of Sacramento v. Lewis,
the Court said that they -- it's the better approach.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could you have
cross-petitioned in an effort to get damages, so if you
had wanted to preserve the issue, you surely could have
done that, couldn't you?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: S.G. could have
cross-petitioned, but she decided not to.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But then we wouldn't have a
case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there's nothing in the
record that indicates that you're withdrawing your
Monell action against the municipality, is there?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: The Monell action against
the municipality was dismissed on the facts.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't it -- isn't a
motion to reinstate it still pending in the district
court?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: The motion to reinstate it
was denied without prejudice to reinstate after this
Court rules, and --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right, so it's still
alive. And --
MS. KUBITSCHEK: It's still alive.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- there's nothing in the
record to indicate that you won't ask that it be
reinstated.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That's correct.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Is that against a different
party, Ms. Kubitschek?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: That is against Deschutes
County, Justice Kagan.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But who is -- who is
on the other side of the county?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: I'm sorry; who's on the
other side of the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The claim pending
below involves which two parties?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Oh, it -- it involves S.G.
and the county.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh. So --
MS. KUBITSCHEK: -- claim that it's alive?
The claim that is alive involves different incidents,
incidents that took place in March of 2003, not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the decision on
the merits here have any relevance whatever to the
action that's still pending?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: No.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you agree that if
-- if this is -- we vacate the decision on the merits,
that's of no meaning whatever in the pending action
below?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: It would not have an effect
on the action.
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that we dismiss the
case as improvidently granted, while indicating in an
opinion some of the questions that we find difficult
such, for example, as the seizure question, et cetera;
what kind of impact would that have in your opinion?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: If the Court were to
dismiss the case as --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, if -- while indicating
the reasons being in part that there are difficult
questions here, suggesting what they are. What would
the -- impact would that have?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, it would
have some impact at least on the Petitioner's position.
The Petitioner's opinion as stated in their brief that
all seizures of children to investigate child abuse are
constitutional at their inception, meaning there --
there are no limits, there are no constraints on what a
child abuse --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It wouldn't affect your
client in any way, because she's out of it and you were
candid from the beginning to say as far as she's
concerned this is a moot case; but as far as Camreta and
the other officers are concerned, we were told by
Oregon's representative that they are not -- that they
have tailored their behavior to conform to this
decision.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: And, Your Honor, that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So --
MS. KUBITSCHEK: -- that would be to -- to
tell the officials who investigate child abuse that in
the name of protecting children, they do not have free
rein to do anything and everything that they think is
appropriate, because what they do harms children,
including the very children they claim to be trying to
protect.
As Justice Breyer said, even raising those
questions would -- would be beneficial to children who
are forced to undergo child abuse investigations, 75
percent of whom have not been abused at all, and who
find the experience psychologically traumatic.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you're making an
argument on something that you've already told us you
have no cognizable interest in -- correct?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Correct.
JUSTICE ALITO: If you were designing what
you would regard as an ideal system, and you're very
knowledgeable in this -- in this area, and you concluded
that some kind of approval by a detached individual
should be required before something like this is
allowed, would you set the standard at probable cause?
Would you say that the child protective service has to
have probable cause that there's abuse before they can
question the child to find whether or not there was
abuse, or would you set it at some lower level?
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, in fact, Your Honor,
the -- most of the States have a procedure for seeking
court approval, and their -- they differ in whether they
require probable cause or reasonable suspicion or
something like reasonable cause; and so while we put in
our brief that the seizure of S.G. should have been
based upon probable cause, given the law enforcement
component, if there was -- if Alford, the deputy
sheriff, were not there at all, and it was purely a
child welfare seizure and the child welfare caseworker
were going to a juvenile court judge and seeking some
kind of judicial approval, the -- because the laws of
the States differ between reasonable suspicion and
probable cause, I would suggest that the better course
would be to let this play itself out between those two
legal standards.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MS. KUBITSCHEK: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Kroger, you
have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. KROGER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KROGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, just a point of
clarification before you go on. You said earlier that
your office had advised the county not to seize
children. Does that mean they're not talking to
children at all? Is -- you used the word seized. Are
you advising them that they don't have the right to talk
to children? Without their parental consent or a
warrant?
MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, but they would
have to talk to children in a way which runs no risk of
being found of seizing the children within the meaning
of the Ninth Circuit decision.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so then walking along
the hall in the school, right?
MR. KROGER: I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Just come up alongside:
"By the way, I wanted to ask you whether your mother --"
(Laughter.)
MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor, and you can
see the problem which the Ninth Circuit decision causes
practically on the child welfare system in the State of
Oregon. The -- Mr. Camreta and other child protective
services workers under the Ninth Circuit decision face
an enormous burden. In most of these cases it is
impossible to establish probable cause to get a warrant
without first speaking to the child because the child is
usually the only witness that is available to the
government; and so to require, as the Ninth Circuit has
here, that we obtain a warrant prior to even speaking to
a child victim places --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the standard?
mean, I just assume you're not suggesting that this
procedure could be used with every child in every school
without some ground for suspicion, correct?
MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, we believe that
reasonable suspicion is the -- is the proper basis
before making a seizure of a child to conduct one of
these inquiries.
Significant here in Griffin and subsequent
cases like Lidster, the Court has recognized that the
relationship between the State and the person being
searched or seized is significant to the reasonableness
analysis, and here it is not an adversarial
relationship. The child and the State share a
significant interest in making sure that that child is
safe; and were the government to continue to be put in a
position of not being able to speak to a child until
probable cause has developed in some other way, children
will continue to be placed at risk.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General, I take it that
that problem disappears -- tell me if I'm wrong -- if we
find there's no jurisdiction. If we Munsingwear this
case, the decision is wiped off the case, you return to
status quo ante, and you tell all your people that they
can do what they would have done beforehand; is that
right?
MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.
That would be a -- a significant step forward for Mr.
Camreta and others similarly placed. The -- the
challenge is that those kind of claims then would be
perpetually subject to -- to qualified immunity because
the law would not be clarified. And that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you -- are you --
and I guess what I'm asking is, let's assume we go ex
ante. At any moment that an agency speaks to a child,
they can move from a nonseizure to a seizure, correct?
And some seizures can be reasonable and some can't,
right?
MR. KROGER: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And law enforcement is
never going to know where that line of reasonableness or
unreasonableness is, is that correct?
MR. KROGER: That's correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's in -- that's in
the nature of doing this without a warrant, isn't it?
MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor. That's part
of the reason we agreed that a seizure was committed
here, so that law enforcement are not placed in a
difficult position every time they speak to a child, of
trying to make their own determination as to whether --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they do it anyway,
meaning even if we say that they can seize the child,
you would still have to not do a seizure that was
unreasonable. You wouldn't -- in scope. They can't
speak to the child endlessly, can they?
MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, that's correct.
The government officials will have to conduct that --
that seizure in a reasonable manner for a reasonable
duration. That's different, I think, though, Your
Honor, than the threshold question of if they start to
talk to a child, of trying to judge in the middle of an
interview, have we gone too far, has a seizure occurred.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not quite sure why
you stipulated to a seizure in this case, but that was
your strategic choice.
MR. KROGER: Mr. Chief Justice, the question
is whether vacating the decision will have an impact on
the litigation below, and it will. The Respondent is
seeking to preserve the Ninth Circuit decision precisely
to aid the Fourth Amendment claim that the Respondent is
making against Deschutes County, and thus, this is
somewhat analogous to the situation in the Pacific Bell
case, where you have a Petitioner and Respondent seeking
different remedies from this Court in light of the
impact that it will have on subsequent litigation.
JUSTICE ALITO: Ms. Kubitschek said it was
based on different events. Is that right or not?
MR. KROGER: The due process --
JUSTICE ALITO: The Fourth Amendment claim
against the county is based on -- on this interview?
MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I have not seen the
new complaint, but my understanding is that it is the
same event and same claim.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
The case is submitted.
