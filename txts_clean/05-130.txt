Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The fundamental question that's posed in this
particular case is whether or not the court of appeals
by adopting a rule that declares categorically that
three out of the four traditional factors for deciding
whether or not to grant permanent injunctive relief
will be irrebuttably presumed to be satisfied whenever
a jury has found that a patent is valid and has been
infringed.
The rule in the Federal Circuit for at least
years has been that if you have validity and
infringement decided by the jury, that then there is
irrebuttable finding of -- of irreparable injury, of
inadequate remedy at law, and that the balance of harms
decidedly favors the plaintiff, and that the only issue
that remains available to the defendant in that
circumstance is a heightened scrutiny on the standard
of whether or not the -- the public interest commands
that an injunction be denied in a particular case. And
even in that context, the Federal Circuit's rule is
extraordinarily stringent because not just any public
interest can -- will satisfy, but instead, it has to be
a public interest that endangers the public health.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that all in Judge
Bryson's decision? I certainly didn't see it there.
MR. PHILLIPS: That -- that is precise -- I
think it's the only way to read Judge Bryson's
decision, Justice Ginsburg, where the court says, at
page 26a, that a permanent injunction will issue once
infringement and validity have been adjudged, and then
say, to be sure, it will not be so to protect the
public interest. And we all know the traditional rule
with respect to the grant of injunctive relief is that
it's a four-factor test.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't see anything
about irrebuttable presumption.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the point is that if an
injunction follows with a finding of -- of validity and
infringement, then that means that there has to be --
there has to be irreparable injury, inadequate remedy
at law, and that the balance of hardships has to tilt
in -- in favor of the plaintiff. And then the only
issue that remains is whether or not the public
interest justifies not granting an injunction under the
circumstances of this case. It seems to me there's no
other way to read that.
And if you read it in the context of the --
of the previous 20 years of decisions from the Federal
Circuit, it is absolutely clear. We don't have the
opportunity to come back as a defendant in an
infringement action and say, Your Honor, in the
specific facts of this case, this is someone for whom
money damages is a completely adequate remedy.
And -- and it seems to me quite clear that
section 283 is designed to be exactly the opposite of
the way the Federal Circuit has interpreted this --
this scheme. Section 283 says explicitly -- and this
is at page 1 of the blue brief -- district courts,
quote, may -- not shall -- grant injunctions in
accordance with principles of equity. And principles
of equity, as Justice Story said almost 200 years ago,
systematically reject the idea that you will act on a
categorical basis in deciding whether or not to grant
or withdraw the injunctive relief in -- in particular
circumstances. And to the contrary, you have to look
at each specific issue.
And in that regard --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is that so with --
with respect to someone else's use of -- of your
property? It seems to me very rare where -- where
someone takes your property, that the court wouldn't --
wouldn't give you the property back and -- and simply
say, you know -- I can think of a few extraordinary
examples. If somebody makes a statue out of stolen
gold, you know, the -- the old classic, I guess you'd
get the money back. But ordinarily we're talking about
a property right here, and -- and the property right is
-- is explicitly the right to exclude others from --
from use of that. That's what the patent right is.
And all he's asking for is give me my property back.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And -- and Congress
already made the -- the balance, Justice Scalia, with
respect to that because Congress obviously identified
the property right as the right to exclude. And then
Congress did not confer upon the district courts no
discretion to act in -- in a situation where the
property right has been violated. Instead, Congress
expressly adopts in 283 a very broad grant of equitable
discretion. To be sure, in the ordinary case, you --
you very well may have irreparable injury proved, but
the question is, do you -- do you eliminate any inquiry
and any specific facts of the case and instead not only
presume it, which I think is a mistake, although the
district court did that and found that in this case the
presumption was rebutted, but to -- but to say
irrebuttably it's presumed that you have irreparable
injury, irrebuttably presumed that you don't have an
adequate remedy at law, and irrebuttably presume that
the balance of equities tilt in favor of the plaintiff.
And that, it seems to me, cannot be squared with the
language of the statute.
And, indeed, on that score, the United States
sort of magically ends up on our side of the -- of the
table because the United States says the same thing.
There is no way --
JUSTICE BREYER: On Justice Scalia's
question, I was trying to think of some, and I was
trying to think the analogy might -- you might find
some analogy in the public utilities field, the -- or a
ferris wheel or something. What you want is a person
who uses his property not at all himself, but licensed
the public generally. And now would a -- would a court
issue an injunction there? And as I think about that,
I don't realize I don't know the answer.
MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know of any. I mean,
I certainly wouldn't categorically declare that you
have to I guess is the way I would respond to that.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's what -- I mean,
that -- that's what you're trying to analogize this
case to, I guess, is a person who licenses others to
use his property and never uses it himself.
MR. PHILLIPS: That's precisely what this
case involves.
JUSTICE BREYER: And there, I don't know how
courts do normally act in other areas of property law.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that there
are a whole lot of them like that, but the one thing
that -- I mean, there are two things to think about the
property concept in the statute.
First of all, Congress does not declare that
the property interest here is a real property interest,
which traditionally has been protected differently.
It's a personal property interest, which is
traditionally given -- accorded less protection under
this kind of a scheme. And so there -- and -- and
again, Congress in any event struck the balance. It
didn't say, as it could have, that there is presumed --
there's a presumption that we have an injunction. It
didn't say, as it could have, that we shall have a --
shall have either a presumption or an injunction in any
particular case. And so under the statutory scheme
here, it seems to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but -- but the
exercise of discretion is channeled over time, as -- as
judges apply it in -- in similar cases. You're not
suggesting that in a typical run-of-the-mine patent
case, no special considerations, it would be wrong to
say that in those cases you typically would grant an
injunction?
MR. PHILLIPS: I think in those cases, the
irreparable injury and the inadequacy of the remedy at
law will be -- will be easy to demonstrate, as they
have been for hundreds of years.
The -- the fundamental difference -- this is
important to have this in mind. The Federal Circuit
adopted this rule of law some 20 years ago. That's
before the high-tech boom, before the explosion in the
number of patents. And so the opportunity to deal with
these issues on an individualized basis that might give
rise to some kinds of rules that you could, in fact,
apply to the generality of cases based on an experience
has never been there. We have been dealing with an
irrebuttable presumption for 20 years in a way that has
-- has completely stultified the ability to develop any
of those kinds of rules.
And what we're asking this Court to do at
this point is to say, no, enough is enough. We need to
go back to a time where the -- go back to the language
of the statute, confer the discretion on the district
courts.
And it's important not just for a case like
this one, but it -- but it distorts tremendously the
settlement value and the process and the relationship
between the patent holder and all of the potential
licensees because we're in a -- in a world -- and I
don't think the Court can ignore this because it's in
the amicus briefs. We're in a world where if a patent
holder files a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas, no patent
has ever been declared invalid in that jurisdiction,
and no patent has ever been found not to infringe.
And then you take that finding automatically and you
turn it into an injunction. Any person who has been
threatened under those circumstances and told that
we're going to face a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas is
going to have a very different negotiating posture than
in a situation where --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I mean, that's --
that's a problem with Marshall, Texas, not with the
patent law. I mean, maybe -- maybe we should remedy
that problem.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I hope you do.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But I don't think we should
write -- write our patent law because we have some
renegade jurisdictions.
Why -- why isn't the -- the free market
normally adequate to solve any problems you're talking
about? Everybody is in this for the money. Nobody is
going to hold off giving the license beyond the point
where -- where it makes financial sense.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't -- why can't we
let the market take care of the problem?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the -- the
market will take care of the problem. The question is
under what standards are you going to apply. Are you
going to say that there is no effective check on the
jury system, that it goes automatically from a jury's
finding to injunctive relief, or are you going to
implement it against the backdrop of what Congress
specifically provides, which is that the district
courts should exercise equitable discretion in deciding
how best to proceed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the problems with
the district court exercising equitable discretion
without a close review by the Federal Circuit is just
the thing that the Federal Circuit was created to
handle, that is, you get a tremendous disparity among
district judges. I don't know that it's only in
Marshall, Texas that you have a tilt in one direction
or in the other. So the Federal Circuit is put there
not to say that the district judges have no discretion,
but to try to rein it in somewhat so that you won't
have wide disparities, which you very well might have
if you just say discretion to the district judges and
very light review on appeal.
MR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Ginsburg, the --
the problem with that is that that's not the scheme
that Congress created with respect to the remedial
aspects of -- of the patent laws. I mean, it is surely
the case that Congress meant, as -- as substantive
patent law is generally enforced and implemented, that
the Federal Circuit would play a significant role in
ensuring some kind of uniformity, but Congress didn't
then go the extra step and say, and when it comes time
to decide whether or not injunctive relief ought to be
granted, that it will -- that we will presume it or
that we will deal with it in a categorical way.
Congress granted that discretion to the district courts
and with good reason because district --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think maybe you exaggerate
the -- the extent of equitable discretion. I mean, it
wasn't as though it's just left up to the judge, seems
like a good idea or not a good idea. There are a lot
of rules for when -- when you would give injunctive
relief and not. And -- and I -- you know, I'm not sure
you're going to get into the kind of wide-ranging
allowance that -- that you seem to be arguing for.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that I need
a wide-ranging allowance with respect to this. What I
need is elimination of the irrebuttable presumption
that doesn't allow any consideration of whether money
damages are adequate in a particular case.
And -- and here, it's very important to
focus. The -- the district judge didn't just say, I
woke up this morning and I felt really good about the
defendant, and therefore, I'm not granting an
injunction. The district court here said, I'm making
specific findings of fact with regard to the adequacy
of money damages to deal --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but he said
other things too, and one thing he said is, I don't
like business method patents very much, and so I'm not
going to give an injunction here.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that was
proper or improper?
MR. PHILLIPS: That's -- that's not precisely
what he said, Mr. Chief Justice. What he said was that
business method patents stand on a somewhat different
footing because they're subject --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He said there's a
growing concern over the issuance of business method
patents.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that an
appropriate consideration to take into account in
determining whether to grant an injunction or not?
MR. PHILLIPS: I think probably, at the end
of the day, it wouldn't be, but the bottom line is that
he did that in the context of analyzing the public
interest consideration and he said that didn't --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then he went on
and he said --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- tilt in favor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- another -- another
consideration is that this patentee does not practice
its patents. But, I mean, isn't that just saying he's,
you know, the -- the guy in the garage and he's an
inventor and the way he's going to market his
discoveries is by getting some firm that basically
speculates on patents.
MR. PHILLIPS: Sure. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if he's denying
that inventor, you know, the -- what he'd give to Bell
Labs -- or whatever Bell Labs is these days -- that
does practice the inventions --
MR. PHILLIPS: I should know that actually,
but --
(Laughter.)
MR. PHILLIPS: But, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I
think you can -- it's -- it's not fair to pick apart
each one of his findings and say does that finding good
enough or is that finding enough.
The truth is the district court made a series
of four findings that overlap, and one of which was,
obviously, he doesn't -- he doesn't practice this
patent. He also doesn't effectively license. He's
willing to license his patent to eBay. He's willing to
license this patent to anybody under these
circumstances.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but --
MR. PHILLIPS: And candidly, most of the
licensing arrangements don't even exist, and they're --
I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I interrupted
you.
But the -- the business process point you
give away fairly quickly. I -- I thought that was
rather substantial. The whole point is, is that a
business process patent is -- is difficult to define
and could be very -- it can be very restrictive.
MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think in -- in a proper
case -- and I don't think you do it under the --
under the public interest analysis. I think you'd
probably end up doing it under the balance of the
hardships. But in any event -- and -- and what you --
you know, obviously, this case is -- is more
complicated because --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: My concern is if you take
that away, I don't know if you've got a lot left for
the -- saying no injunction in this case.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I mean, there's
plenty left because he doesn't practice this invention.
He has no intention of practicing this invention
beyond the receipt of money. Money damages are a
completely adequate remedy under these particular
circumstances, given -- given especially the fact that
if -- if the infringement continues -- and remember,
this is not a situation where he proposes to continue
to infringe. We propose to work around it, but if the
infringement continues, we're then subject to enhanced
damages and all of the deterrent power that that has,
plus the possibility, obviously, down the road that the
district court could, on a rule 54 motion, now come
back and say, well, no, now I've decided that
injunctive relief is warranted under these
circumstances.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, isn't it a concern
that Congress didn't provide for compulsory licensing
which this seems to have a very strong resemblance to?
It says eBay wants to do this, so they're going to
have to pay for it, but the patentee can't stop them.
It just has -- in effect, has to license them to do it.
MR. PHILLIPS: But -- but we're not asking
for a compulsory license because it is not our
intention, going forward, to infringe this patent.
We've made it very clear to the district court and the
district court recognizes that we not only intend to
but have, in fact, implemented a design-around or a
work-around to this particular patent. And that's what
we expect will happen. So we're not asking for the
right to continue to infringe and a willingness to
pay as we go.
Our concern -- and this does go to the
business method patent because it does go to the -- to
the uncertainty. The problem we have here is we don't
know where the line is going to be drawn. That's why
the district court said specifically, you know, there's
going to be unending litigation on this because it's
very difficult to define the metes and bounds of this
particular patent, and we're going to have to fight
over that, so that the traditional reason for
injunctive relief, which is to bring peace, isn't
available in this case. We're not going to have peace
under these circumstances.
And when you have that situation and you have
the kind of uncertainty, not because of business method
patents generally -- that's -- that's where I was I
think probably giving up too much immediately. I don't
think the fact of a business method patent is per se a
problem, but I think analyzing the specific business
method patent and its uncertainty is a legitimate
consideration for the district court to take into
account in deciding whether or not, in a particular
circumstance, we are better off saying, pay the
plaintiff the money for the past injury, let's see how
the work-around develops, and take it into account, but
without the sort of --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, tell me how
-- how this works. It seems to me that an injunctive
hearing is -- might be the cheapest, most effective way
to -- to sort out whether there's going to be a
violation. You call the parties in and they indicate
what -- what they propose to do, and the judge says,
well, this is within it or it's without it. It's --
it's much cheaper than a -- a new lawsuit.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, of course, the
consequences of the -- of the process are significantly
different because, obviously, the remedies for -- for
contempt are significantly more draconian than -- than
just a finding of a -- of a violation.
But more -- more important than that, Justice
Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but this gives you
the advantage of coming in in advance saying, I want --
I -- I want a ruling in advance that I'm not going to
violate the injunction. You've got a cheap lawsuit.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, and the reality is the
district court already looked at this and said that it
-- it is the district court's judgment that they're
going to require full infringement trials. I mean,
that was the finding it made with respect to the
balance of hardships. And -- and neither the court of
appeals nor the -- nor the Respondent in this case has
-- has challenged that particular finding. So the
reality is the district court has made the
determination that that's not -- that process is either
not available or not practical in the context of this
particular case, which of course, goes back to why it's
important to make sure that you look at each of these
cases on their individual facts rather than across the
board on a -- on these -- on an irrebuttable
presumption basis.
The -- the additional point that I think it's
important I at least spend a minute on, because the
Court asked for us to deal with Continental Paper Bag,
is that it does seem to me quite clear that, at least
at this stage, the parties are pretty much in sync,
that -- that the Court need not revisit Continental
Paper Bag. The holding in that case is actually almost
a sort of quintessential situation where you have two
participants in the market, one of whom would like to
take advantage of a patent that will improve that
participant's ability to produce a product. The patent
holder is not ready yet to develop that product using
that particular method and, therefore, sues to stop his
competitor from entering into that market. I mean,
that's the classic kind of situation where you have a
-- you know, where you -- where you've got the
potential infringer is looking at what's going on and
making a decision and copying it and then trying to
implement it. And the Court said, under those
circumstances, you get an injunction.
But here, of course, we're dealing with a
vastly different situation, as we -- as we point out
that -- in our brief, where the -- at page 9 where the
district court specifically found that not any of
eBay's success is attributable to anything in the
patents of the plaintiff in this case and that nothing
in the patents that were put forward by the plaintiff
in this case provide any basis on which anyone could
build a business model. So this is, to my mind, the
antithesis of the situation in Continental Paper Bag.
But in any event, the holding there is
clearly not implicated here. It's been codified by
Congress. There's no basis for the Court to reconsider
To the extent that there is -- is dicta in
there that talks about the right to exclude, Justice
Scalia, I think, in general, the right to exclude is
one that you do, in fact, enforce with injunctive
relief in many cases, but the question here is whether
or not the Federal Circuit should have adopted a rule
that says you -- you enforce it in every case
irrebuttably as to three of the four factors, and as to
the fourth factor, you don't go any further than
requiring the plaintiff to show that there's a -- an
imminent public health crisis.
Under those circumstances, it seems to me the
Court should reverse the court of appeals. And,
indeed, if there were ever a case in which the Court
ought to uphold the district court on a -- under the
abuse of discretion standard, it is this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why should we -- if I
can get back to one of the factors. Why should we draw
a distinction between the -- the sole inventor who
needs a patent speculation firm to market his discovery
and -- and somebody else? Why -- why should he lose
the leverage of the normal injunction and have
substituted for that a duel of experts over what a
reasonable royalty should be?
MR. PHILLIPS: Because the -- because
Congress didn't dictate that he gets that leverage in
every situation. And -- and it's quite possible that
the -- there are going to be a lot of situations. And
the Solicitor General's brief identifies four of them
in which an inventor, who doesn't plan to practice the
invention, engages in -- in various kinds of licensing
schemes that create all kinds of interrelationships
among the way the patent is going to be developed, and
I think all of those are perfectly legitimate and could
easily justify injunctive relief in precisely the kind
of case that you pose, Mr. Chief Justice. But that's
not this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- maybe I
don't understand what it means to practice the
invention. If -- if I -- does that -- if -- if I
invent something, you know, a new -- better way to make
a car engine work and I want to sell that to somebody,
that's -- you'd say that's not practicing the invention
because I don't build cars?
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But again, you've
licensed it and there are certain rights that,
obviously, arise out of the licensing. None of these
factors is alone, I don't believe, sufficient to say
you don't get injunctive relief. But I think what the
district court said, and I think that this is why the
Court ought to affirm the district court's under --
under an abuse of discretion standard, which never been
applied to this case -- what the Court should say is,
look, and where you have no practicing of the invention
by the inventor, where you have a complete willingness
to license not only to the world, but also to eBay
specifically, and where you've never sought preliminary
injunctive relief, under all of those -- and where --
and where there's serious question about the lines to
be drawn, there's no benefit to be had by -- in the way
of trying to eliminate the amount of litigation on an
ongoing basis, under all of those circumstances, all of
which the district court identified, then it's not
appropriate to grant injunctive relief. We'll allow
enhanced damages in the interim and even the potential
down the road, obviously, of -- of an injunction to
serve as enough of a deterrent to protect the right to
exclude that the plaintiff has under the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why does the fact
that -- that you're not practicing the invention make a
difference? I mean, why -- why should I be in better
shape, as far as getting an injunction is concerned, if
I produce an automobile engine and -- and make some
undeterminate profit --
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- from the use of this
particular invention in the engine than I would be if I
licensed it with a royalty based upon the number of
sales of engines? I mean, they're both risking, you
know, the same future use of the -- of the device. Why
-- why does one situation justify an injunction more
than the other?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I think -- I think I
ought to modify it slightly because it's not just
simply that you don't practice the invention. It's
that you're not in the market itself because that's --
that's the Continental Paper Bag case. You know, in
Continental Paper Bag, they don't want to -- they don't
want to practice the invention either because they want
to hold it back in order to be able effectively to use
it. If they had wanted to license it, that would have
made sense too.
But this is not a competitor in the market.
If they were a -- it seems to me you have a much better
claim to a need to occupy space. That's what the
injunction is trying to say. This is my space. I want
to occupy it. But if you choose not to occupy it, it's
not to say that you abandon your right to an
injunction, but that that ought to be a legitimate,
individualized consideration, among other
considerations --
JUSTICE SCALIA: By not occupying it, you
mean including not licensing it to somebody else.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you didn't license it
-- and actually we have no relevant licenses here too
-- that would be another factor that ought to be --
that ought to count in the mix. Again, it's not -- I'm
not looking for a presumption the other way and I'm not
looking for categorical rules that say that if you --
if you're a nonperforming entity, that you don't get a
license, or even if you're a troll, as that term gets
bandied around, that you're never entitled to a -- to
an injunction.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is -- is the troll
the scary thing under the bridge, or is it a fishing
technique? I -- I want --
(Laughter.)
MR. PHILLIPS: For my clients, it's been the
scary thing under the bridge, but --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, is that what the
troll is?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I believe that's the -- I
think that's what -- what it is, although you -- maybe
we should think of it more as Orks, now that we have a
new generation, but at this point troll is the word
that gets -- that gets used.
If there are no further questions, I'd like
to reserve the balance of my time, Your Honors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Phillips.
Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. MINEAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The United States submits that the right to a
patent is an important matter, but it must be
considered in the context of the remedies as well.
And the United States further submits the
patentee's right to an injunction should be covered by
the familiar four-factor test this Court has applied in
cases such as Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo. This
Court's express endorsement of the four-factor test
would provide disciplined guidance and a framework for
the lower courts to evaluate whether or not a patent
should issue in any particular case.
The court of appeals in this case did not
make express reference to the four-factor test.
Nevertheless, it did identify the difficulties with the
-- the district court's decisions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think Mr.
-- you don't think Judge Bryson forgot about the four-
factor test, do you?
MR. MINEAR: Absolutely not.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. And -- and he
was just reflecting the reality that in a typical case,
this is what happens. It seems to me all you want us
to do is edit his opinion and stick in this formulaic
paragraph about there are four factors and here they
are.
MR. MINEAR: Not exactly, Your Honor. We
think that there is some legitimate confusion among the
patent bar and in the community about whether or not
this test issues nearly automatically or not.
Certainly there are many amicus briefs on both sides.
And we think it's useful for this Court to make clear
that this is an exercise of equitable discretion.
Now, Judge Bryson, I think, was aware of the
four-factor test. In fact, both parties cited the
four-factor test before the district court.
He was also aware of the abuse of discretion
standard. That's a well-established standard and the
parties cited that standard to the Federal Circuit in
the course of briefing this case below.
But what we think this Court can do is it can
provide guidance on how those factors are applied in
the patent context in this very important area. We
think the court of appeals decision is correct. The
judgment is correct. But we think that there's some
benefit to this Court explaining why that is so, and
I'd like to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you about
one factor in particular? What if by the time you get
to the injunction stage, the -- the patent office has,
you know, rejected all of the underlying claims in a
preliminary way? It's not final. Can the district
court take that into account in deciding not to issue
an injunction?
MR. MINEAR: Well, I think, Your Honor,
you're referring to the reexamination process
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
MR. MINEAR: -- that, in fact, is ongoing in
this case. And we think merely that the Patent and
Trademark Office's office action is not sufficient. In
this case, if I can speak outside the record, there has
been what is called a first office action and a second
office action, but no final action by the PTO. But
even if there was final action by the PTO, that would
still be subject to review by an administrative body,
the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, and
there would be further judicial review. The PTO would
not withdraw the patent, would not certify that it's
invalid until the conclusion of the judicial process.
So we think for that reason the district
court should not act precipitously. It may have -- the
district court would have discretion to take that into
account, whether it should stay further proceedings
pending the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what
struck me as odd there. Footnote 27 says that's a
basis for staying the injunction. It seems to me if
it's a basis for staying the injunction, it's a basis
not to issue one in the first place.
MR. MINEAR: Well, it also might be a -- a
basis in terms of how to structure the injunction. We
simply meant to indicate in footnote 27 the district
court has discretion on remand to take these factors
into account based on where the case is at that time.
We're not taking a position one way or another what the
Court should do in this particular case. That is an
exercise of discretion. It's subject to review for
abuse of discretion.
But I would like to talk about the four
individual factors in this case because I think it
provides helpful guidance in the resolution of the
dispute before the Court.
As an initial matter, with regard to
irreparable injury, patent infringement normally will
result in irreparable injury because it denies the
patent holder its statutory right to exclude others
from practicing the invention. It's the type of right
that is susceptible to irreparable injury because --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it denies the right
subject to being a damage remedy that's available.
MR. MINEAR: That's correct, but the
difficulty here is the pragmatic question of whether
the district court can determine whether damages are
appropriate or not in a particular case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it always -- is it
always going to be irreparable injury if the patentee
always gets fairly compensated?
MR. MINEAR: No. There -- we certainly
recognize there can be cases where there would not be
irreparable --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So if there are some cases
when he gets fairly compensated and some he does not,
why should you say it's always irreparable injury?
MR. MINEAR: Well, my -- our position is not
that it's always, but that it normally is irreparable
injury. It usually will be. And there are certainly
circumstances we can envision where it would not be
irreparable injury.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that usually will be
because usually damages are not an adequate remedy?
MR. MINEAR: Yes, that's correct. And the
reason why damages are not an adequate remedy is
because, as Judge Easterbrook indicated, it's very
difficult for the district court, looking forward, to
determine what business opportunities are available to
the -- to the licensor or the practitioner in the face
of the prospect of continuing infringement. And that
is why, as Judge Easterbrook noted in the Catheter
case, the injunction harnesses the market to determine
what the market value of that patent is. It forces
negotiation between the parties, as compared to the
court acting to try and develop a reasonable royalty
based on a battle of experts.
JUSTICE SCALIA: When you say going forward,
I thought we were talking about damages for the past
violation, not damages for future violations which will
continue. Are we talking about that too?
MR. MINEAR: Yes, that's what we're talking
about.
JUSTICE SCALIA: About the court effectively
saying, yes, here pay him and -- and go on and skip
away and continue violating it.
MR. MINEAR: Well, when a district court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: In this case, they -- they
claim not to want to violate it in the future. They're
just talking about, you know, the -- the past actions
should -- should be compensable by damages and not --
they should not be subjected to a very threatening
injunction.
MR. MINEAR: Yes, but in this case the
district court has awarded the damages for the past --
past actions already, and the question is how will we
deal with the threat of continuing infringement. And
the difficulty that the district court faces here is it
has to, if it takes no action, as it's done now, it
will at some later date have to go back and determine
what those damages would be.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- when they will be
calculable. You're saying it's hard to calculate them
into the future. You want the district court to
calculate what the future damages will be and say, we
think the damages will be this. Here, take your money,
and you, God bless you, go continue to violate the
patent.
MR. MINEAR: Absolutely not.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that what --
MR. MINEAR: We are suggesting what Justice
Kennedy suggested; namely, that the injunction
proceedings provide an opportunity to determine whether
or not the supposed work-around that eBay has will work
or will not, and the injunction will be structured to
allow it or not, depending on whether or not it's
determined to be infringing. That allows the market to
go forward with a determination, a certainty that eBay
will have that its work-around is either violative or
it is not. But our view is that by issuing the
injunction, the district court, in the proceedings
leading up to the injunction, can determine whether or
not this work-around is valid or not.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a classic case
where the injunction should not be issued?
MR. MINEAR: Yes. There -- I think there --
this is a four-factor test, and there are questions of
balance of hardship and public interest. And certainly
equity should be cautious not to inflict unnecessary
hardship on parties. In the case of a nonwillful
infringer, for instance, that has made good faith
investments that might be set aside by the -- by an
injunction, there might be grounds in those
circumstances not to issue an injunction. There's also
a public interest inquiry as well. If the injunction
would threaten national security, public health and
safety, undermine core aspects of commerce --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Business processes?
MR. MINEAR: Well, business processes are not
-- the district court clearly erred here in saying that
the mere debate about business process patents is a
reason for withholding injunctions. That simply is not
a sufficient view -- reason in our mind for weighing
against the general public interest and the
enforceability of patents and the use of injunctions to
make sure that those property rights are secure.
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm curious about
your nonwillful infringer. You're devaluing the value
of a particular patent by denying the injunction simply
because the people who infringed it weren't willful,
and I wonder why that makes sense.
MR. MINEAR: We're not suggesting that
automatically that there is withhold with relief
because of a nonwillful infringement. We're simply
drawing the -- the distinction between a case, such as
this, where there is willful infringement -- and, in
fact, the party has been found to have both had notice
of the patent and also have known that it did not --
did not have a reasonable basis for concluding it was
not infringing or the patent was invalid. In those
circumstances, the patentee takes on greater risk than
the party that simply is not aware of the -- of the
patent and in a sense stepped over a property line
without realizing that, in fact, it was there.
This is, again, a four-factor test, and we
believe all factors need to be considered in order to
provide the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it your bottom line
then, send it back with your four-factor test, because
there seems to be some uncertainty whether that was
applied?
MR. MINEAR: We don't think that's
appropriate because, first of all, the -- the court of
appeals did identify the factors the district court
relied on that weighed on -- it thought weighed on
eBay's side of the balance, and it properly rejected
each one of those.
But furthermore, we think that this Court's
enunciation of the tests and the application of the
tests, much as it did in the patent case of Pfaff v.
Wells Electronics 3 years ago, could provide very
useful guidance in terms of how this test applies in a
specific, concrete context.
But the factors that the court of appeals
relied on here and rejected, found insufficient were
really quite right. First of all, there should not be
an automatic distinction between a party that practices
the patent and one that licenses it. They both have --
JUSTICE BREYER: There isn't an automatic
distinction, but a person who licenses a patent and who
is licensing a patent that probably won't be developed
very much beyond what it is -- it's fairly easy to --
I'll ask Mr. Waxman.
MR. MINEAR: Thank you, Your Honor.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Minear.
Mr. Waxman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I -- I can anticipate at least one question.
Let me just say at the outset --
(Laughter.)
MR. WAXMAN: -- that long, perhaps centuries,
before Justice Story ever wrote his commentaries on
equity, it has been firmly, unequivocally established
that a final judgment, not -- we're not talking about
an interlocutory order, but a final judgment of patent
infringement yields an injunction in all but the very
rare case. And that settled regime is not an exception
to traditional equitable principles. It's an
application of those principles.
Equity, as this Court has reminded us over
and over again, including in the Weinberger and the
Amoco cases -- equity first takes account of the nature
of both the right at stake and the violation. And
because the only right that a patent provides under
U.S. law is a limited-term right to exclude others from
practicing the invention, infringement produces an
injury that is both, A, irreparable by its nature and,
B, continuing in the nature of a continuing trespass to
chattels. And under traditional equity principles, a
showing of either of those things, either irreparable
injury or a continuing harm, warrants an injunction in
the owner's favor unless the offending party can
marshal very strong equities otherwise. That is the
settled rule.
Now, no such showing could be made in this
case. The jury found, by clear and convincing
evidence, that eBay had willfully infringed the '265
patent, that it knew about it, and it had no good faith
belief either that the patent was invalid or that it
was not infringing. The jury was told that if it found
either of those things, it could not find willfulness,
and it found willfulness by clear and convincing
evidence.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We also know by now
that the patent office has rejected all of the claims
of the patent. The staff.
MR. WAXMAN: The -- what we know is that --
that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, with the following
clarification, that the office action, as Mr. Minear
has indicated, represents a -- an initial judgment by a
staff member in the office.
And what -- what is quite -- and it is --
doesn't represent even the PTO's final judgment in the
case, but what is really revealing here is that
reexamination is a process that was invoked by eBay.
And as we point out in our brief, typically if a
competitor is concerned or doubts the validity of a
patent, it will invoke reexamination, ask the PTO to
reexamine it when it first learns about it. eBay not
only didn't invoke reexamination, it cited the '265
patent at least 24 times years before. It then came to
MercExchange and offered to buy it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a factor that
a district court could take into account in deciding
whether to issue an injunction?
MR. WAXMAN: I don't --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Say the injunction
question came up right now, today. Could the district
court say, well, the patent office staff has rejected
every claim of this patent, and I'm going to take that
into account in deciding whether to put eBay out of
business?
MR. WAXMAN: I think that -- the case that
the U.S. cites in its footnote is an example where
reexamination processes are underway when the case is
first filed or when it's pending in the district court,
and the district judge certainly has the discretion to
say, I don't want to get into a -- a fight here about
separation of powers and Hayburns case. Let's let the
reexam proceed, and then we'll have a trial.
In this case, eBay waited not only until it
was sued and not only until it was found to have
willfully infringed this patent, but in the middle of
the appeals process. It then comes running in and a
rule that would allow a district judge now to give
notice of that in denying an injunction would basically
be a -- an open invitation for everybody to go ahead
and try and win at trial, go through the whole multi-
year process, and if you don't, just put it into
reexam. This -- although the reexamination is required
to be -- is required to proceed with, quote, special
dispatch under the statute, this reexamination of the
'265 patent has been almost 3 years in the patent
office and we still don't have a final action.
So we think, in the circumstances of this
case, where the district judge had no reason to
consider reexam because eBay hadn't invoked reexam at
the time, it would be an abuse of discretion for the
court to either refuse an injunction or stay it in
light of the fact that it's now proceeding.
But that's not an issue for this Court. It
wasn't an issue for the court of appeals because it
wasn't part of the district judge's analysis of the
requisite equitable factors.
And what -- if I can just get back to the
facts of this particular case and then talk about the
law. The finding of eBay's willfulness in this case
disables eBay from invoking the relative balance of
harms. We certainly agree --
JUSTICE BREYER: Why? I mean, I think there
are so many factors that could enter into it.
MR. WAXMAN: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: What I was going to ask was
if you have a -- a patentee that does only license and,
moreover, licenses only to people who, by and large,
will not take that product and develop it further, then
it's fairly easy to calculate damages.
Now, couple that with a client or a patentee
who also waits for a long time, waits till the
invention is embedded in a series of other inventions
so that if, in fact, there's an injunction, what will
happen is that the patentee will be able to extract far
more than this particular invention is worth because
the infringer would have to give up the entire
invention.
MR. WAXMAN: Justice --
JUSTICE BREYER: Couple that with a patent
that, if you read it on page 2 of the red brief,
reminds, at least one person who read it, namely me,
that if this could be patented, maybe A&P could patent
their process for a supermarket. I -- I mean, you'd
worry about that as a judge. And couple that with all
the other things that are here.
Now, special case? Why not?
MR. WAXMAN: I've been asked to couple so
many things together, I may forget some of the
coupling. Please -- I mean this in seriousness.
Please remind me because there is a very good answer in
law and on the record to each of your points.
JUSTICE BREYER: The main point -- what I was
trying to do is I was trying to take what I'd call the
patent troll case.
MR. WAXMAN: Okay. First of all, this is no
patent troll. The founder of MercExchange really did
invent this innovation. He really did, as the record
clearly shows, spend years of effort trying to build
the system to suit himself, and he is no promiscuous
licensor. He has -- it has entered into licenses,
which are all in the joint appendix, that are very
specialized in terms. He was asked by eBay in 2000 to
consider selling them. He offered to license them.
The parties couldn't come to terms, and eBay then stole
the technology. It willfully infringed it, knowing
about it, having cited this as prior art, having had
one patent rejected as fully anticipated by the '265.
And the common law and equitable principles
have -- are quite clear from Story, Pomeroy, all the
way back, that when you -- when you're talking about
balancing private harms, which is what equity courts do
-- I'm not talking about the public interest, but I
mean private harms, when you have an adjudicated,
willful infringer -- I mean, the jury found that it had
no good faith belief either that it wasn't infringing
or that the patent was invalid -- you don't balance
private harms.
But let's take the case in which you don't
have willfulness. It's not this case. Let's take the
case of somebody who doesn't try and, quote, practice
the patent. That's not this case. Let's take the case
of somebody who's a garage inventor who decides the way
to exploit the patent is to license it. License --
this -- so far as I'm aware, this is the first case.
The district court decision in this case is the first
case in the context of a permanent injunction. And
I'll explain why preliminary injunctions that seek to
preserve the status quo are different. This is the
first permanent injunction case I'm aware of that has
ever thought that exploiting the patent by licensing it
to others to make use of would in -- somehow be costly
or disable you from obtaining the relief that section
3 and the -- and tradition provided.
Section -- section 284, which is the damages
provision, talks about remedies, remedies for
infringement that has already occurred.
The text of section 283 says -- the other
side keeps referring to may, may, may not, shall.
That's fine. But the purpose of it is to prevent. The
operative word in 283 is to prevent. And unless there
is an instance in which the patent has expired, the --
the infringer is out of business and can show that it
couldn't possibly infringe anymore, an injunction
issues to prevent further violation.
JUSTICE BREYER: On that very point, my
question there really was -- that was the heart of it
-- that I don't think there's a moral or even patent-
related value attached to whether you practice it
yourself or not. It's just that when you license it,
it's easier -- and a lot of other things matter too.
MR. WAXMAN: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: But it's easier to calculate
the damage. Now, at least in some subset of cases.
So if you have a case where, on the one hand,
it's easier to calculate the damage remedy, and at the
same time you fear that to issue an injunction will
produce a harm to the other side way out of proportion
to, in fact, the value that's being lost by infringing
on the patent, then those are two things you'd put in
the balance.
MR. WAXMAN: That's --
JUSTICE BREYER: So the -- other things being
equal --
MR. WAXMAN: In the case of a nonwillful
infringer, a court in --
JUSTICE BREYER: No. Willful, willful. It
wouldn't matter willful or nonwillful, because if he's
willful, the reason that he might be willful is he
thinks that the patentee is holding him up.
MR. WAXMAN: You know, the -- the -- there
are 52 self-proclaimed intellectual property professors
that filed a brief written by Professor Lemley in
support of eBay in this case. Professor Lemley
testified under oath to Congress that, even though
there are problems with patent trolls, in the case of a
willful infringer, the law -- equity doesn't balance
private harms.
But even if that were wrong, I acknowledge
that in balancing, there may be cases in which you can
show a vastly disproportionate harm. Okay? I mean,
the other side has amicus briefs that come up with
these hypothetical scenarios about, you know, one
little aspect of a computer chip that has 30,000
components to it. Note, A, that all of those are
hypothetical, and B, I'll explain why it's a problem of
extremely limited circumstances.
But, of course, equity courts can decide
that, just as they can decide whether the -- the,
quote, innocent patent holder is guilty of laches,
unclean hands, estoppel, all of these other equitable
considerations that aren't captured by this formulaic
four-factor test but that equity courts, including
district courts sitting under -- under 283, consider.
But this is not the case of some profligate
licensor. This is somebody who has licensed with
specific provisions. The other side says, well, there
are no operative licenses, suggesting somehow that the
AutoTrader license, which is one of our examples, is in
fact invalid. That came up in their reply brief. It
is not correct. It is absolutely true that eBay will
not -- the '265 patent is included by that license. It
relates to the field of use of auto sales. It provides
specifically that eBay -- that MercExchange cannot
receive royalties unless it enforces this patent within
the field of use. There is no doubt that -- that
MercExchange will not be able to start getting patent
royalties from AutoTrader unless and until it obtains
this injunction. And for example --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, you
mentioned, in -- in responding to the suggestion that
we're dealing with a troll, you described -- what
exactly is the invention here?
MR. WAXMAN: The -- the invention is a --
it's -- it's not a business method. It doesn't claim
methods. It claims a system, an apparatus for an
electric market for the sale of goods via a network.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Electric. I mean,
it's not like --
MR. WAXMAN: Electronic market.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- he invented the,
you know, internal combustion engine or anything. It's
very vague I think, and this is one of the
considerations --
MR. WAXMAN: Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the district court
mentioned. The exact parameters of when it was going
to be infringed and when it wasn't were amorphous. And
so isn't that a factor the district court can take into
account in deciding whether to issue an injunction
because it's going to be hard to issue an injunction to
define exactly when it's going to be violated and when
it's not?
MR. WAXMAN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, if it
turns out that it's too hard and -- and the -- and a
specific injunction can't be written, rule 65(d)
requires that an injunction not issue. And in fact, as
we've cited in pages 17 and 18 and, I think, 19 of our
brief, the Federal Circuit has, in fact, overruled
injunctions that were insufficiently precise to satisfy
rule 65.
But the claim of imprecision here is -- look,
I'm not a software developer and I have reason to
believe that neither is Your Honor, and I -- I can't --
(Laughter.)
MR. WAXMAN: -- explain specifically what
this claims. It's laid out very carefully in --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I may not be a
software developer, but as I read the invention, it's
displaying pictures of your wares on a computer network
and, you know, picking which ones you want and buying
them. I -- I might have been able to do that.
MR. WAXMAN: Well --
(Laughter.)
MR. WAXMAN: I'll say respectfully that that
is not a fair characterization of the innovation here,
the actual innovation.
But let me just say, for purposes of this
case, there is no challenge continuing to the validity
of this patent. It was challenged before the district
court and on appeal on grounds of an inadequate written
description, et cetera, et cetera, and upheld. There
was a Markman hearing in which the district court
construed the patent, added certain claim limitation
terms that eBay wanted and we thought were not fairly
in it. But significantly, there was never -- never --
a claim to the judge -- and this is an issue for the
judge under section 112, paragraph 2 -- of -- of
invalidity for indefiniteness.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the patent
office staff has rejected all the claims. I don't know
on what grounds.
MR. WAXMAN: The patent office -- none of the
claims have been rejected on indefinite grounds. They
have been rejected, as I understand it, certainly in
this patent, for obviousness under prior art, which is
all the same prior art that was presented to an Article
III court here and that a jury entered a finding on.
There are a host of questions that undoubtedly will be
presented in the case, if it ever happens, in which a
final -- Patent and Trademark Office, on the validity
of a patent, contravenes something that a -- a final
judgment of an Article III court. But that's not this
case.
And we certainly agree with the United States
that when -- if the judgment is affirmed, the case will
go back and the district court will then have to
address a point it hasn't addressed yet, which is is
the -- is the -- the permanent injunction proposed by
MercExchange adequate or inadequate and how can it be
made specific, and this supposed work-around -- does it
or doesn't it violate the terms of the injunction. I
mean, the district judge actually found bad faith --
this is page, I think, 71 of the petition appendix --
of eBay in its conduct in the district court of
proclaiming that for $8,000 -- its experts testified
that for $8,000, they could work around or design
around this problem and there wouldn't be an
infringement. But they didn't do it. And they didn't
-- they certainly didn't appear to have done it in the
Federal Circuit because their brief in the Federal
Circuit never mentions it, and the Federal Circuit
opinion surely would have said, they've designed around
this problem and, you know, therefore this, that, or
the other. Even in this Court, eBay has said in its --
in its opening brief at page 43, here there is a
possibility that the infringer can develop a work-
around. Well --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman, could you help
me with something I just realized I have no conception
of here? What kind of -- what do these injunctions
say? Do they just say don't infringe patent '265
anymore, or do they give a list of things you cannot do
and a list of articles you cannot make and so forth?
MR. WAXMAN: You couldn't just say don't
infringe anymore because rule 65(d) requires
specificity and precision. Ordinarily what happens in
these cases is there's -- you know, there's usually
been a claimed -- a detailed, claimed construction
following a Markman hearing. There have been jury
instructions. The jury instructions have to
specifically describe to the jury on what basis it's to
conclude who is right --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The thought just occurs to
me and I -- frankly, with all the briefs we've had, I
feel kind of stupid not to have thought it before. But
it seems to me a great difference might turn on what
exactly the injunction provided. Some injunctions must
be -- might be much more burdensome than some others.
If they're not all fungible, that's certainly true.
MR. WAXMAN: Certainly not. And the terms of
an injunction are appealable, and the Federal Circuit
has reviewed actual terms of permanent injunctions and
reversed a number of them and said this is -- this
doesn't satisfy rule 65 or it doesn't meet other
requirements.
But in the -- in the context of this case, it
is so critical that the judgment be affirmed, not
vacated, because this is a real inventor. This is
somebody who really did try to put it in place. This
is somebody who eBay approached and then, when they
didn't buy it, appropriated the technology, and the
validity and infringement are final. They aren't even
challenged in this Court.
And any suggestion that uncertainty exists on
the facts of this case would dramatically destabilize
settled law, licensing practices, and the investment-
backed expectations of patent holders, large and small,
the sole -- you know, hall of fame inventors that are
in the Cooper brief filed in support of us and big,
integrated companies like GE and Johnson & Johnson that
have also filed on our side.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this?
MR. WAXMAN: These are patent portfolios --
JUSTICE STEVENS: One -- one short question.
Is the draft of the injunction that you want in the
record?
MR. WAXMAN: It is in the court of appeals
record, but not the joint appendix. But it certainly
will have to be changed because the court of appeals
invalidated the '176 patent, which the jury found had
been infringed, and therefore, it's -- it will need to
be revisited when the case goes back for the entry of
an injunction.
Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Waxman.
Mr. Phillips, you have 6 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I realize I'm the only thing standing between you and
lunch, so I'll try to be brief at this point.
Justice Stevens, with respect to the place in
the record, this is in the joint appendix and the court
of appeals at A6523 -- 62523. That's the proposed
permanent injunction, and I won't purport to read the
whole thing, but it starts off with anything directly
or indirectly, and it goes on for three pages. It is,
I think, fairly characterized as a very broad
injunction.
The -- I think it's important, after Mr.
Waxman's challenge to the conduct of eBay in this case,
to -- to recognize that willfulness in the patent
context has a meaning different from willfulness in any
other context. And it is recognized that we're talking
about simply a failure to satisfy a duty to check out
and find a lawyer's opinion that a particular
infringement has not taken place or that the patent is
not valid. And when you do that, you of course incur
the risk that you will also waive your attorney-client
privilege. So there's a risk to it. And that's the
willfulness that we're talking about here.
With respect to the notion of stealing this
patent, let's go back to what the district court
specifically held on page 68 of the appendix. Where
the defendants maintain that their success did not
arise from the use of anything contained in the
plaintiff's patents and the defendants argued that the
patents offered no business or engineering guidance
which the defendants could copy, and this court agrees
with that. That's not the kind of bad faith or
willfulness -- it's the reason why the court didn't
grant enhanced damages. It's the reason why the court
didn't grant attorney's fees in this particular case,
and it doesn't provide a reason for simply jettisoning
three out of the four factors that ought to be applied
in the traditional -- in the traditional test.
And, Justice Breyer, you asked the question,
what are you going to do with a situation where you
have the embedded patent and you have the case like
this one where we're going along with our process and
we've got our source code and we've done all of the
hard work, and they go along and come up with some sort
of more vague idea and show up at our doorstep and,
one, claim that we've got to stop doing what we're
doing, or, worse in other cases, we're going to find
situations where it's embedded in a manufacturing
process. Mr. Waxman says, well, in that situation
equity will step in. Not so under the Federal
Circuit's approach because that's a balance of the
equities kind of a consideration, and that's
irrebuttably presumed to favor the plaintiff under the
Federal Circuit's approach.
Mr. Chief Justice, I know, as well as you
know, that Judge Bryson understands the four-factor
test and the abuse of discretion standard. And what he
did in this case was to go through each of the findings
of the district court with respect to the use of the --
of the licensing arrangements, the failure to
commercialize this, not being in the business, and
said, does any of these rise to the level of the kind
of public interest concern that is the only legitimate
consideration this court will use in deciding whether
or not the district court can justify not granting an
injunction in a particular case, instead of what is
clearly the traditional approach of equity, which is to
say, look at the -- the primary two issues, you know,
the flip side of the same thing, so I'll just treat it
the one way. Are money damages adequate in the
specific case? That's the fundamental question that
equity asks. That's the fundamental question that the
district court found to be satisfied in this case.
Money damages will get the job done. The right to
exclude will be adequately protected by enhanced
damages and even potentially injunctive relief in the
future. Beyond that, nothing more is required.
That's the kind of decision that a district
court who has sat in a 5-week trial and has overseen
this entire litigation is uniquely suited to make a
judgment. That judgment is entitled to respect on a
classic abuse of discretion standard. The court of
appeals long ago jettisoned that approach, and the time
has come for this Court to say no, that's not what this
Patent Act requires. The Patent Act says the right to
exclude is important, but it's only protected by the
principles of equity under section 283. That wasn't
given here. We urge you to reverse the court of
appeals.
If there are no further questions, thank you,
Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
