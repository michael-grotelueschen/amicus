Mr. Rovelli.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS J. ROVELLI
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROVELLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The policy challenged in this case applies to
a small class of dangerous, disruptive inmates, all
confined at level 2 of the Long Term Segregation Unit,
which is the most restrictive custody in the
Pennsylvania prison system.
These central facts inform every aspect of
the Turner analysis which governs the outcome of this
case. The denial of periodicals and photographs, with
the opportunity to earn them back by improved behavior,
is logically connected both to rehabilitation and
security. Level 2 inmates have a -- have failed every
attempt at rehabilitation. Yet, nearly all of them
will be released from prison. The goal at level 2 is
to turn these inmates around, to improve their behavior
enough that they can be advanced safely to programs
with more opportunities for self-improvement. Until
that happens --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Rovelli, I -- I forget.
How big a class of -- of prisoners are we talking
about?
MR. ROVELLI: Less than 40.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Less than 40? And does the
record tell us how long they have been in level 2?
MR. ROVELLI: Well, the duration of -- of
confinement at level 2 varies widely from one inmate to
another because it is affected by their improvement.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But is there any average or
any -- is there -- does the record tell us how -- how
long most of them have been there?
MR. ROVELLI: The record does not tell us how
long most of them have been there. At the time of the
case in the trial court, which was 2002, 25 percent of
them had been promoted to level 1 or had been released
from the Long Term Segregation Unit altogether.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean that 75
percent had not?
MR. ROVELLI: At that time, yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And how long -- do we know
what the average period of incarceration in level 2 is?
Is it a matter of weeks, or is it a matter of years?
MR. ROVELLI: Well, realistically it's in
between. Again, the -- the unit had only been in
operation for 2 years at the time that the record was made.
So there's very little --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm trying to understand
whether typically they're there for a long period of
time on the one hand, or are they there sort of on
probation and are periodically reviewed and moved into
another system?
MR. ROVELLI: They're -- they're moved when
their behavior improves. The average over a long
period of time has been in the range of a year or so.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I see.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there any prisoners,
since the inception to your program, that have been in
there for the whole 2 years?
MR. ROVELLI: Through today? I'm sorry. Oh,
from the time of its inception?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.
MR. ROVELLI: Until the 2-year point. Yes,
there were. I don't know exactly how many there were,
but there definitely were.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are -- do -- is -- is
Pennsylvania alone or nearly alone in imposing this
rule, or is this typical of the restraints imposed in
-- in this maximum restrictive confinement?
MR. ROVELLI: There's a wide variation of
privilege grants and withdrawals even at the highest
levels of security. The ACLU's amicus brief points to
three other States that -- that have the same program
as Pennsylvania, and frankly, I'm not even sure as to
those, that it's identical. But the Court has
recognized that -- that these sorts of variations,
particularly when we're talking about high security
prisoners, are precisely what Turner contemplates.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is this one of the most
severe restrictions in the Nation with respect to
reading material and photographs?
MR. ROVELLI: I'm sure that it is.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the reason that --
that the State or the regulations allow paperbacks from
the library and not current events? I'm just -- that
-- the rationality of -- of that line escapes me.
MR. ROVELLI: Well, there's -- there is
certainly a security component to it. Paperback books,
small, compact, much more difficult to use as weapons,
and the experience of the prison staff that operate
this high security unit is that newspapers and
magazines are -- have been a -- a frequent source of
mischief.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can we explain that? How
--
does one use a newspaper as a weapon? I mean, you
know, maybe disciplining a dog or something.
(Laughter.)
MR. ROVELLI: Actually inmates, particularly
the worst of the worst, are quite clever at using
newspapers. A newspaper rolled tightly with toothpaste
used as an adhesive can be compacted into very nearly
the equivalent of a nightstick.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But a paperback
version of War and Peace is less dangerous? It seems a
MR. ROVELLI: The experience of prison
officials is that, yes, it is, and -- and actually it's
very common in prison systems to distinguish, for
example, between hardback books and paperbacks. Yes,
it's -- these are difficult lines to draw, and that's
where the professional expertise of the people who deal
with the problems every day comes into play.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the concern is the
safety concern, then you would have an equal concern
with the Jewish Daily Forward, which is a newspaper
format, or -- and I don't know what the Watchtower
comes out in these days.
MR. ROVELLI: Yes. Well, Justice Ginsburg,
the -- the experience of prison administrators is that
prisoners are less likely to use religious and legal
materials for mischief, and as to paperbacks as well,
they do supply an alternative means of receiving
information from outside the prison. But again, if I
-- if I allude frequently to the experience of prison
administrators, it's -- it's because that's what these
-- this policy is guided by. Newspapers and magazines
have a high value to inmates.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's why I
thought your answer would have focused on that rather
than the security concerns, is that you take away what
it is they want the most because that's most likely to
result in them conforming their behavior so they can
get it back.
MR. ROVELLI: Yes, and that is -- is the
primary purpose of the policy overall, and --
JUSTICE BREYER: So why -- let's see. They
go to the prison library what? Once every couple of
weeks or what? Once a week?
MR. ROVELLI: Actually --
JUSTICE BREYER: One -- one visit per month.
And -- and how often do they go to the prison library?
MR. ROVELLI: Inmates at level 2 are not
permitted to go to the prison library.
JUSTICE BREYER: It's ordered.
MR. ROVELLI: They can order books from the
library. They are allowed to visit the -- the mini law
library that's proximate to the unit.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, what it says -- that's
what -- it says, to review legal materials, one at a
time may be let out of his cell and is escorted to a
mini law library in hand. All right.
Why couldn't you have a -- if he wants to see
the newspaper in that mini law library, why couldn't
there be a copy there, only the parts that are
consistent with the censorship policy, just like a news
of the day.
MR. ROVELLI: Having --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a security reason
or is --
MR. ROVELLI: There's definitely a security
reason.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a security reason
when he's there in leg irons looking at the books, the
law books, in the mini law library?
MR. ROVELLI: Allowing the -- the inmate to
request to go to the mini law library for an additional
purpose or for a separate purpose to read periodicals
puts increased demand on going there, and moving these
inmates is a -- a very demanding operation. It
requires two officers and physical restraints and going
through layers of security. So it puts increased
demands on prison resources.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What does the -- what does
the inmate have to show in order to go to the law
library? That is, suppose the inmate's position is I
want to go there and I want to read Law Week and Legal
Times and other -- I want to see what's new, what's
breaking in the law so that maybe I'll have something I
can put in a petition, and that's why I want to go
every -- every chance I get to the law library. Could
such an inmate go to the library?
MR. ROVELLI: Yes. The inmate may go to the
law library subject to the limitation of one inmate at
a time, subject to the sign-up list. The inmate may
get --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that would mean that
the inmate could go and look at the legal newspapers,
but not -- not the Christian Science Monitor.
MR. ROVELLI: The Christian Science Monitor
is not available to him in the -- in the mini law
library, and -- and actually, if he wanted to
subscribe, he could receive a -- a legal periodical in
his cell.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So he could get Law Week,
Legal Times, and --
MR. ROVELLI: Subject --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the National Law
Journal. All of those he could get.
MR. ROVELLI: Subject to the content
restriction of religious and legal materials that would
fit in one property box, he may.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, on -- on your theory of
-- of behavior modification, would it, nonetheless, be
-- be open to the State to say, no, you may not receive
any more legal materials and you may not go to the
library to look at them? Because that's something you
very much want to do. And in order to do that, you've
got to shape up and -- and get moved down to a lesser
level of security. Would that -- I'm not saying that
the State is -- is about to do that, but on your
theory, could the State do that?
MR. ROVELLI: Yes. Yes, Justice Souter, the
State could, as long as the overall Turner analysis is
observed. And, in particular, I think that would
implicate the availability -- the availability of
alternative means of exercising the asserted right to
receive information from outside the prison.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what would -- I mean,
you know, one of the arguments made on the other side
is that if you accept the behavior modification theory
as an adequate justification, the Turner categories
essentially become incoherent.
What, for example, would be the alternative
means in this case if the State said, we realize that
the people in -- in -- at level 2 want to see legal
materials very, very much because that is a source of
hope for them, and we want them to have that source of
hope only if they shape up and -- and get down to a
reduced level of security, so we're going to stop it,
period? What would be the alternatives within the --
the Turner analysis?
MR. ROVELLI: The inmate would still have
unlimited access to counsel visits and can still visit
the mini law library and do his own legal research,
even if he's not allowed to subscribe to or -- or keep
legal materials, legal periodicals in his own cell.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What if the -- what if the
inmate said, look, the -- the lawyers who come to see
us are -- are great guys, but they're -- they're
overworked. They don't have time to be thinking about
novel legal theories, which we would dream up perhaps
if we could get to Legal Times and these periodicals?
So it's -- it's not an alternative.
MR. ROVELLI: Ultimately any prisoner is --
is free to challenge the adequacy of his ability to
access the courts in a -- in an as-applied challenge to
his own conditions.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're -- you're saying
there -- there's a separate value here, and that is the
value of access to courts. And -- and that limits what
can be done for purposes of behavior modification.
MR. ROVELLI: Definitely.
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. What about the
marriage example? The -- the Court has said, yes, you
couldn't -- the -- the State can't prevent the inmate
from -- from getting married. I don't see where the
separate source of -- of value is that would -- that --
that would affect that analysis. No right of access to
court. The associational rights can be abridged and so
Why, on your analysis, wouldn't -- wouldn't
the proper disposition of the earlier case have been to
say, yes, the State can preclude marriage too because
that's something they very much want and -- and the
State can preclude that unless they shape up and -- and
get down to a -- a lesser level of security?
MR. ROVELLI: Well, the marriage ban, Justice
Souter, of course, is subject to Turner analysis as
well, and I think that where Turner might bring up
short a ban on marriage for these high security inmates
is in the -- the logical connection to the
rehabilitative purpose in that there being so few
inmates and marriage is going to be such an infrequent
occasion, it's hard to see the marriage ban as
influencing level 2 inmates generally to improve their
behavior.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying there just
is not a logical connection there within --
MR. ROVELLI: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the meaning of the -- of
the case?
MR. ROVELLI: That -- yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But there would be a logical
connection for those who want to get married.
MR. ROVELLI: That -- that implicates --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You're -- you're saying it
might not make sense as a systemic policy --
MR. ROVELLI: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- because it isn't a big
enough problem. But for -- we're not talking about a
whole system here. We're talking about 40 people or
less, and if some of those 40 people want to get
married, why doesn't it make perfect sense to say no
marriage?
MR. ROVELLI: Well, you could say that about
all -- probably a range of things if you went so far as
to query each inmate as to what it is that they value
most or what it is they're most interested in doing --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You can, and on -- on your
analysis, why isn't that sufficient?
MR. ROVELLI: It would be an interesting
program and I would defend it that you could query
inmates on what is most valuable and then deprive them
of it subject to --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but how do we get
around the marriage case then?
MR. ROVELLI: Well, I -- I don't think we
need to get around the marriage case in the sense that,
particularly as to high security inmates, prison
officials have very wide discretion to fashion policies
that serve the goals. And -- and to do it --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So as to these, the -- the
marriage could be banned, in effect, you're saying.
MR. ROVELLI: It could be banned, but I do
think that it would be subject to a -- a pointed
challenge on the logical connection, but in theory,
it's -- it is one of the instruments -- a privilege
that could be withdrawn for behavior modification
purposes.
This case is -- is exceedingly similar to
Overton where the Court directly observed that
withdrawing visitation privileges is a proper and even
necessary technique to -- to improve the behavior
especially of high-security prisoners who have few
privileges left -- left to lose, which is precisely the
same situation that we're presented with in this case.
Turner too -- I'm sorry. Overton as well is
instructive on the subject of adequate alternatives.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought there, there
was a genuine security concern, which I think you
pretty much said doesn't exist here when you consider
what they can have in -- in the cell.
MR. ROVELLI: I think that -- that in both
Overton and this case, there were both behavior
modification and security concerns. And I'm not even
sure that their weight -- they're weighted as between
the two altogether different between the two cases.
Actually all of the discussion in Overton was in the
context of behavior modification, which is related both
to security and to rehabilitation. But the -- the
tenor of the discussion was actually, I would say, more
directed to rehabilitation.
The Court recognized in Overton, as adequate
alternative means of exercising the right, letters and
phone calls. The inmates in this case have the
opportunity of unlimited correspondence, family,
chaplain, and counsel visits, and as -- as we've talked
about, books from the prison library.
Quickly addressing the last two Turner
factors, accommodating the asserted right would
altogether defeat the goals of the policy. It would
have, as I alluded to when I did speak of security, a
significant impact on guards and prison resources, and
there are no ready alternatives.
If I could reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Rovelli.
Mr. Marcus.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. MARCUS: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Pennsylvania's policy of prohibiting its most
dangerous and recalcitrant prisoners from possessing
newspapers, magazines, and photos as an incentive to
improve their behavior does not violate their First
Amendment rights.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where do you draw the
line? I take it somewhere -- you couldn't deprive them
of food, if that would get them to -- to conform.
Justice Souter was asking about marriage. I mean, how
do we tell when -- when you can deprive someone of
something they -- to modify their behavior and when it
goes too far?
MR. MARCUS: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. This --
I mean, this Court has already said that with respect
to Eighth Amendment rights, the Turner analysis does
not apply. So with respect to basic -- basic
necessities, health care, food, and water, the -- the
Turner analysis doesn't apply, and so you could not
sort of create an incentive program to take away Eighth
Amendment rights.
And under -- with respect to the rights that
can be -- that can be limited in order to serve
legitimate penological interests, we think that -- that
the Turner approach would give a lot of deference to
and a lot of flexibility to States to -- to use
incentive programs --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But don't we -- don't we
have the same problem if we're -- if we're dealing with
First Amendment interests that we do when we're dealing
with Eighth Amendment interests? In other words, if --
if we don't say, well, they get outside of Turner
analysis because they require -- by virtue of being
enumerated rights, they require an analysis specific to
them, is the abridgement of the right carried so far
that it is unreasonable? If we don't say that, then I
don't see, as your friends on the other side have
argued, I don't see where the logical stopping point is
if we accept the -- the behavior modification theory.
MR. MARCUS: Well, I -- I think -- I mean, I
think there is -- I don't think it's a boundless
theory. I think you have to keep in mind that this
program in Pennsylvania was -- it's implemented as a
last resort. I mean, the prisoners that this
regulation applies to are a narrow class of 40
prisoners who have been the most violent and most
disruptive --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, oh, I -- I realize that.
I mean, they're -- they're making an in extremis kind
of argument. I understand that. But if -- if we
accept an in extremis kind of argument on the theory of
behavior modification, then I don't see why that
argument does not, for example, cover the marriage
case, and maybe -- maybe it should. I don't know why
that argument would not allow for a total deprivation
of all communication outside of, let's say, access to
counsel.
And -- and so it seems to me that whether we
admit it or not, what's going on here, whether we call
it Turner analysis or not, is we're making some kind of
a judgment as to whether they're carrying the
deprivation for behavior modification purposes in these
extreme cases too far.
MR. MARCUS: But --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And if that's what -- I'll
-- I'll be quiet in a second.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOUTER: If that's -- if that's what
we're doing, aren't we just as much outside the Turner
analysis when we're talking about the First Amendment
or associational rights under the First Amendment as we
are when we're talking about the Eighth Amendment? And
shouldn't we say so?
MR. MARCUS: I -- I don't think so, Justice
Souter. I think there's still room under the Turner
analysis to apply the exaggerated response test, and
that's one of the things the Turner analysis does when
you go through the four factors, as -- as the
Government did and the State has done in its brief,
that there could be a situation where you would find
that there's been an exaggerated response and that
their withdrawal of the First Amendment right is
actually an exaggerated response.
For example, maybe if -- if there was just
one minor disciplinary violation for, let's say, using
obscene language, and then every -- all First Amendment
rights to communication were -- were pulled out at that
point for the remainder of the time --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so but at some point,
there's sort of a reasonableness limit then you're
saying.
MR. MARCUS: There is a reasonableness limit,
and we've -- we've --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do you concede that
just because a right is enumerated, it means it cannot
be entirely taken away in prison?
MR. MARCUS: No. This Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, like, you know, try
the right to bear arms.
(Laughter.)
MR. MARCUS: That's right. No. I mean --
no. This Court has drawn -- has drawn that
distinction. The distinction this Court has drawn is
that -- that most rights can be limited or even totally
prohibited within prison, consistent with -- with
legitimate penological objectives, deterrence or
rehabilitation. The exceptions this Court has
identified are for the Eighth Amendment and also for
access -- you know, access to the courts, that you
could -- that -- because that also implicates the
integrity of the criminal justice system.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Apart from those two,
access to the courts and cruel and unusual punishment,
then anything goes for this set of incorrigible
prisoners? They can take away -- the First Amendment,
in other words, is out the window. They have no First
Amendment rights that the State needs to respect. Is
that --
MR. MARCUS: Well, I think it would be --
Justice Ginsburg, I think it would be a rare case where
an incentive program like this could be struck down as
a -- you know, as a facial matter, as -- as this
challenge is. I think it would be a rare case. But I
think you do -- you do still go through all the -- all
four factors, and you would look at the fourth factor
and see that, in fact, Pennsylvania does give prisoners
the opportunity to regain those privileges if they
behave well. As the State pointed out, at the time the
record was made in this case --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but for this -- for
this group, while they're in that situation,
essentially there's no First Amendment rights. I think
that's what your -- your argument. They can regain
them, but that's the purpose of the behavioral
modification program. But the -- the only thing that
these prisoners get is the Eighth Amendment.
MR. MARCUS: Well, we do think that -- that
the State can go -- can go quite far with respect to
restricting First Amendment rights, but this Court
still -- I mean, under prong two, this Court does look
to alternative means to exercise the right. And here,
.9 percent of the prisoners in Pennsylvania, do get
to possess newspapers, magazines, and photos. The LTSU
prisoners who graduate get to, and on top of that,
while they're in the LTSU, the prisoners get to possess
two books. They --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Marcus, I was kind of
interested in your calling this an incentive program.
Is there any -- there are no intermediate stages. It's
an all-or-nothing incentive, isn't it?
MR. MARCUS: Oh, not at all. There are many
-- there are many intermediate stages. There are
restricted housing units and then there are SMUs and
-- and special management units, and -- and --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I mean, with respect to
the prisoners in this population.
MR. MARCUS: There are incentive programs
within each of those restricted units, and -- and the
prisoners that end up at the LTSU -- the vast majority
of them have already been through the SMU program and
haven't made it and have failed that program. So
they've tried numerous other incentives before getting
to this point.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I didn't understand
that the -- the prisoners in this particular part of
the prison had any intermediate incentive. They either
get out after a year or 2 or they don't. Isn't that
right? I mean, they either get to a different
classification.
MR. MARCUS: Right, and that depends on their
behavior.
JUSTICE STEVENS: There's no scoring. You've
got 25 points now, so you're pretty close to your goal
or anything like -- it's not --
MR. MARCUS: Well --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- not like most incentive
programs I've heard about.
MR. MARCUS: Justice Stevens, they get a
review after 90 days and then every 30 days thereafter.
There's nothing in the record to suggest those reviews
are an empty gesture.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And -- and does the review
correlate it in any way with these particular
deprivations? I mean, what is the review -- how does
the review correlate with their inability to get
reading materials?
MR. MARCUS: Well, the -- the review
correlates with their behavior, and to the extent they
show a positive adjustment in their behavior, their --
they graduate from level 2 to level 1 where they do
have access to newspapers and magazines and then they
can graduate all the way out. And my understanding is
a number of prisoners have done that within 1 year.
And with respect to someone who never gets out, that
person might have an as-applied challenge if that
person could show that his behavior --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any evidence at
all that the amount of reading that they do has any
correlation to their opportunity for getting better
assignments?
MR. MARCUS: While they're in the LTSU?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. That there's any
correlation whatsoever between how much these people --
these prisoners read and when they get into the next
level of the prison.
MR. MARCUS: No, I don't think any such study
is done. But again, the court of appeals was wrong to
require the State to offer evidence. I mean, this
Court has emphasized in Turner that the connection
between the regulation and the goals need merely be
logical.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So the legal issues would
be precisely the same if the State denied totally any
reading material to the prisoners. We'd have the same
issue.
MR. MARCUS: Well, it would be a more
difficult case to defend under the second --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why would it be more
difficult?
MR. MARCUS: -- under the second prong of
Turner because under the second prong of Turner, you
look to alternative means. We might still come in here
and defend that program, but here they do provide
alternative means to read and to see loved ones through
visitation and through correspondence and to have two
-- they have two books in their cell so they can
continue reading. So there -- that -- that does factor
into the balance, and we think it -- it's very clear
that Pennsylvania's program is reasonable, and it would
just be a more difficult case if they totally
prohibited --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I understood your argument
to, in effect, contend that the behavior modification
rationale will justify the program no matter what the
balancing process is.
MR. MARCUS: No, that's -- that's not our
position. We think there is a balancing under Turner,
and you do -- you do look at all four factors of the
test. And we think that Pennsylvania's just clearly
satisfies that test. And if you applied this across
the board to the general population, it wouldn't. It
wouldn't pass the test. But -- but these are the --
these are the worst of the worst and they've gone
through many other -- Pennsylvania has gone through
countless other measures to try to improve these
inmates' behavior, and so I think it's wrong to
conclude, as the court of appeals did, that this was an
exaggerated response.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Marcus.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERE KRAKOFF
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KRAKOFF: Mr. Chief Justice --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Krakoff.
MR. KRAKOFF: -- may it please the Court:
I'd like an opportunity to respond to several
of the points that were made by my colleague.
First, I find it interesting that and also of
some relevance in this case that the decision to deny
access to secular newspapers and magazines that this
policy of withdrawing access to these materials is not
a policy of the Federal Bureau of Prison with respect
to its most maximum security inmates, those who are
housed in the control units.
I also think it's important to note that
while there's a 90-day minimum period that these
inmates have to remain in the Long Term Segregation
Unit on level 2 status where this -- when this policy
applies, the policy also says that as long as an inmate
is serving a disciplinary sentence within the prison,
that he's not eligible for promotion to level 1. And
the testimony from the department's designated witness,
Deputy -- Superintendent Dickson, acknowledged that
most of the inmates in the unit are, indeed, serving
disciplinary time.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, it seems to
me that that's an as-applied challenge. If -- if a
particular inmate -- the terms of -- the conditions of
confinement are particularly harsh and he -- he or she
has an unrealistic opportunity to get to a less
restrictive confinement, then -- then he can bring a
suit.
MR. KRAKOFF: I was -- I was simply trying to
point out -- the -- the Court had asked how long are
inmates generally in the Long Term Segregation Unit,
and -- and the point that I made is that it's not
unusual for inmates to remain on level 2 for periods in
excess of 1 year.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Krakoff, what --
I take it you wouldn't have any objection to
terminating of television rights, for example. If
prisoners have the right to watch television, they
misbehave, the penalty is no television. Is that all
right?
MR. KRAKOFF: That is correct. Our position
is that the choice of what vehicle the institution
wants to permit through which inmates can gain access
to what is occurring outside of the prison walls in
political and other public matters, that's the
institution's choice. And the reason these inmates
sued for access to newspapers and magazines is because
the representative plaintiff, Mr. Banks, was allowed to
receive his Christian Science Monitor magazine because
it was religious in nature, but was denied the
opportunity to receive his Christian Science Monitor
newspaper under -- under this policy.
There's another very important --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What other
alternatives would you have the prison administrators
rely on? You have an incorrigible prisoner who's
misbehaving. He won't behave. They go through every
-- he gets up to level -- level 2. What -- what should
they have done instead?
MR. KRAKOFF: Okay. Bottom line under my
reading of Turner and Safley is that there has to be
first that logical connection under the first prong.
But that's not a -- an imperative --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What
should they have done instead? Let's say he gets out
of the prison 1 hour every other day. Should they have
taken that hour out? I mean, not out of the prison.
Out of his cell. Should they have taken that hour
away, or what -- what other options do they have?
MR. KRAKOFF: Well, what their -- their
argument is essentially that this policy was basically
a decision by default, not a decision that was reasoned
by prison administrators. They -- they essentially
said virtually everything has been taken away from
these prisoners.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, and I want you
to tell me --
MR. KRAKOFF: And we have nothing left to
take away.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would like you to
tell me what else they should have done. Why is that
wrong?
MR. KRAKOFF: It's wrong because there is no
logical connection to taking something away under the
facts of this case when taking away an entire litany of
-- or a very broad spectrum of things which -- in the
special management units, where these inmates came
from, they had had magazines taken away on their first
phase in the special management units. They had been
offered the incentive of earning access to magazines,
of earning access to weekly visits with family members,
of earning access to telephone calls, in fact, of
earning access for release from their cells the 23
hours a day to engage in -- in small group activities
with other inmates. And most spectacular was they had
the opportunity, while in the special management unit,
to earn a 3- to 6-month probationary period in a
general population cell block.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And none of that
worked. Right?
MR. KRAKOFF: Absolutely. And my point is if
-- if that didn't work, including magazines, which is
the equivalent of -- essentially of -- of newspapers,
they had no logical or --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your answer to my
question is there's nothing else they could have done,
but they shouldn't have done this because this wasn't
going to work either.
MR. KRAKOFF: My answer is that you can't
deprive an inmate of his constitutional right of free
speech --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but consistent --
MR. KRAKOFF: -- unless there's reason to do
JUSTICE SOUTER: Consistently with your
answer, it seems to me, you have to say they should
give the TV back, they should give the magazines back
because none of those worked either. And those are
First Amendment deprivations to some degree.
MR. KRAKOFF: What they've done here is
they've removed all of the vehicles to --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But I mean, what's --
what's your answer to my question? It seems to me that
your point to the Chief Justice was the courts have to
review the efficacy of these moves.
MR. KRAKOFF: That's right.
--
JUSTICE SOUTER: And if -- if there is no
efficacy and there is an infringement of what, at least
for people on the outside, would be a protected right,
then they have no justification for taking those rights
away. And if that's going to be the analysis, then on
-- on the argument you just gave, they've got to give
the TV rights back, they've got to give the magazine
rights back, and so on. Isn't that correct?
MR. KRAKOFF: May I answer it this way? I
know I'm supposed to say yes or no and then --
(Laughter.)
MR. KRAKOFF: -- to give an explanation.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I sure would like that, but
(Laughter.)
MR. KRAKOFF: I'll say no. My instinct is
no, and I would also say the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But then why? Why?
MR. KRAKOFF: I've been reading Turner v.
Safley and then more recently Overton because this is
basic in my practice to represent prisoners. And my
reading of Overton is that you can't have a policy.
The prison officials cannot have a policy unless there
is reason to believe that the policy is going to
advance a legitimate penological interest.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And in -- in your
argument, in your answer to the Chief Justice, you were
pointing out a situation in which taking away the TV
didn't work, taking away the magazines didn't work.
MR. KRAKOFF: I think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why then do they not, on
your theory, have to give TV and magazines back?
MR. KRAKOFF: I -- I think that an
institution can always make judgments about how
extensive they want to allow inmates to --
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then where does
your efficacy criterion go? You're saying they may
make judgments, and apparently they may -- may make
judgments and maintain them even if those judgments do
not, in fact, advance their interests. Here, you're
saying they -- it's not going to advance their
interests, so they can't do it. In these cases, you're
saying they don't advance their interests, but they can
as a matter of judgment. And I don't know how to draw
that line.
MR. KRAKOFF: No. I'm -- I'm not saying they
can't as a matter of judgment. I -- I'm suggesting
that they can select among options -- we're
specifically speaking about access to information
outside the prison walls. And what I'm suggesting is
that they can't eliminate every suitable way by which
inmates can gain. And I think the word is of
sufficient utility -- was the -- was the language that
was used in Overton. And I'm saying the bottom line is
they can't eliminate all means by which inmates can
access information.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but -- the whole
rationale of your case -- if I were you writing your
brief, I would have this problem. This really matters
to the inmates, but that's exactly the State's point.
That's the reason it's taken away. It really means
something. And I -- I just -- I just don't know what
to do with that conundrum.
MR. KRAKOFF: I've had other --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and it seems to me
it's the heart of your case and that it surfaces here
in the answers you've attempted to give.
MR. KRAKOFF: Obviously, this -- this did
matter enough to the prisoners to commence a lawsuit.
I don't think that the standard by which a court --
this Court or any other Federal court should determine
whether or not there's a logical connection or a
reasonable connection is whether or not inmates choose
to file suit. That's establishing a litmus test --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the whole basis
for the suit is that it matters to the prisoner, and
that's exactly why it's been taken away because there's
nothing else left that we can do with these prisoners.
MR. KRAKOFF: But I see a distinction. There
are lots of things that matters to prisoners and lots
of things that matter to us in the free world that
aren't going to change our behavior. There -- there
are some things that are important to us --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What about changing other
people's behavior? Your -- your assertion that it does
no good is based upon the fact that it has not altered
the behavior of these people who are in the unit. But
what about other people who don't want to get thrown in
the unit? I mean, don't you have to look at the
deterrent effect? And -- and is it easy for you to say
that the -- that -- that the in terrorem effect of
being deprived of -- of literature, television, or
whatever has not induced other people to shape up?
MR. KRAKOFF: They made the argument that
this is part of an overarching deterrent program.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think it is.
MR. KRAKOFF: Well, but if you look --
Justice Scalia, if -- if one looks at the record
carefully, you see that this policy which, by the way,
applies to 40 inmates in one particular institution in
a -- in a prison system that has 23 adult institutions
for men, that this policy is essentially a classified
policy. The policy itself says this is not to be a
matter of public dissemination and is only to be given
to personnel on an as-needed basis. The inmates who
receive the inmate manual in the Long Term Segregation
Unit have to sign for it. They receive a number, and
every manual has to be returned.
Apart from the prison grapevine, which all of
us know there is a prison grapevine, I submit that it's
-- it's not great enough to tell inmates throughout the
system that, in fact, if you get into the Long Term
Segregation Unit, this very small unit, that you may
lose newspapers and magazines. I don't think it is
known, and I think in order to deter, a policy has to
be publicized, as it was in Overton. Michigan made it
very clear to the prisoners, that if they got involved
into drug violations, that their visits for 2 years
would be suspended.
And if I may --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So let's say if -- if the
flaw is it doesn't deter other people because they
don't know about it, then if they -- if they broadcast
it all over so everyone knows about it, then it's okay?
MR. KRAKOFF: Well, I say that in order to
make a deterrence argument, at least an argument that
makes sense to me, that in order to deter somebody from
doing something, they have to know about that policy
and they have to know what the consequences are. If
there were a secret policy in the State of Indiana that
they, you know, will execute persons committing first
degree murder, any argument that that's going to --
that the death penalty is going to act as a deterrent I
think --
JUSTICE BREYER: But is there other -- are
there other bases? Because so far your argument is
they're so bad that you might as well give them
whatever they want because it won't matter.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm parodying it, but
you understand why I don't think it's your strongest
for the reasons said.
But are there others which might be a little
-- you had other arguments --
MR. KRAKOFF: Yes, and -- and I -- I do want
to say -- and I don't know how to say it more -- more
clearly -- I understand it, but I'm obviously not
framing this in a way that is getting my point across.
I'm not suggesting that because people -- these are
the most incorrigible, recalcitrant inmates in the
entire 38,000 inmate prison system, that that means
that they can get anything that they want.
I'm suggesting that when you take away a very
significant right -- and that is the ability to learn
what is happening beyond the prison walls -- there has
to be a reasonable basis for doing so.
Now, if I've been reading Turner and O'Lone
and Overton incorrectly, then I'm doing a disservice to
my clients.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It has nothing to
do with the law. I understand your argument. Your
argument that you have made is, at the very least, you
can't say that this deterrent effect is that big a
deal. I mean, now, there were other reasons justifying
it. They said, for example, if one --
MR. KRAKOFF: Security.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and they made a big
case in this. It's on 188 in the appendix.
MR. KRAKOFF: Exactly.
JUSTICE BREYER: And they made a major point.
They said that with the newspapers, they set fires,
they throw feces. They use them as a spear, and then
when asked, why couldn't you do the same with library
books, or couldn't you do the same with paperbacks,
they said, yes, it's possible, but it's less likely
because of the size of the document. And we don't have
to forbid everything. We just forbid the things that
we think are particularly likely. Now, what about
that one?
MR. KRAKOFF: Well, my -- my -- I suppose my
most straightforward answer would be that the Jewish
Forward can burn as quickly as the New York Times, that
the Christian Science Monitor --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then now you're
giving -- now you're making their situation worse
because they tried to make your client's situation
better. I mean, yes, they could -- maybe they could
prohibit religious journals as well, but they -- for
various reasons, they decided not to do that. Maybe
they could have eliminated legal materials as well, but
again, they decided not to do it. They take a more
circumscribed approach. So I'm not sure it's a very
effective response to say, well, they let religious
materials in and that can be used as well.
MR. KRAKOFF: I think it's a realistic --
with all due respect, I think it's a realistic
response. I'm not faulting them. I applaud them for
doing what was a reasonable thing.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you were using
that to say that the security concern doesn't hold up
because of the papers that they're allowed to have in
their cells can be used similarly for fires, similarly
to do other bad things.
MR. KRAKOFF: Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So I thought that's why
you were using that, just to say that the -- the
security concern is dubious because the materials that
they are allowed to have in their cells can -- could
achieve exactly the same end.
MR. KRAKOFF: Well, there are other things,
Justice Ginsburg, that are routinely permitted in -- in
the cells and, in fact, that probably have to be in the
cells that can be used. They're given -- they're
giving -- given writing paper, and the testimony of
Deputy Dickson was that they -- they fling feces with
writing paper and they fling feces -- and by the way --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know what kind of a
fire you can make with the Sunday New York Times?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to -- are you
going to compare that to writing paper and -- and to --
to the Jewish Advocate or whatever it is? I mean --
MR. KRAKOFF: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems to me a
perfectly reasonable line.
MR. KRAKOFF: The -- but it's not only --
it's not only writing paper. It's -- and they have to
have blankets. The blankets are flammable. Their
clothing is flammable. The bed sheets are flammable.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if visitors -- if
there's a security issue with visitors to the prisoner,
you're saying you can't prohibit visitors because if
you allow the lawyers to come in, because they're
visitors too?
MR. KRAKOFF: No, I think that would be a
specious argument.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it wouldn't
undermine the security rationale just because you have
some exceptions where there are other countervailing
interests that might outweigh the security concern.
MR. KRAKOFF: But if, in fact, their
suggestion is that -- if their suggestion is that the
inmates are less likely to burn a Bible, for example,
and assuming they're -- they're Christians rather than
somebody else who has the Bible, they're less likely to
burn a -- the Bible or some book of scriptures, that
makes sense. But when you suggest that they're less
likely to burn a legal newspaper or a religious
newspaper, that doesn't make sense.
And I'm suggesting this isn't a question of
equities that if they're nice enough to permit these
prisoners to read religious-based or legal-based
newspapers and magazines, that forecloses the inmates
from saying -- does that make a lot of sense? I don't
-- I don't think so.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is it that I should read
then in respect to what's actually bothering me? In
Turner v. Safley --
MR. KRAKOFF: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- the Court says we
resolve, when a prison regulation impinges on an
inmate's constitutional rights, which it does here, the
regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to
legitimate penological interests. That standard is
necessary if prison administrators and not the courts
are to make the difficult judgments concerning
institutional operations. And that's where I think
it's difficult to balance this case. If we were to
decide for you, are we going too far in interfering on
what the prison administrators should be doing, or have
they gone too far?
Now, if I'm supposed to look at this record
and try and make up my mind, which I think is about
that question, what do you want me to look at?
MR. KRAKOFF: I want you to read the entire
brief --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'll read the briefs.
I have no problem with the briefs --
MR. KRAKOFF: No. I -- I suggest that our --
my brief might be more coherent than I today.
(Laughter.)
MR. KRAKOFF: And I think we make out a
strong case -- that we make out a strong case for why
the policy in question is not reasonably related to a
legitimate penological interest.
I would suggest, looking at another aspect,
Justice Breyer, that there was some comment about the
adequacies of the -- the alternatives, the other
avenues, and that's an important consideration under
the second prong of -- of Turner. And I think it's --
it's strange to suggest that the prison chaplain who
visits level 2 inmates for religious purposes and that
attorneys, assuming that an inmate has an attorney,
generally are going to come discuss either a section
83 action or a criminal case, and that relatives once
a month for an hour are going to discuss current
events, and that they're going to act as kind of a
quasi wire service by summarizing--
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this
question?
MR. KRAKOFF: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You said that the prison
grapevine really doesn't tell the prisoners about this
particular lack of access to public materials. Does
the prison grapevine let them know that they're going
to be in the cell for 23 hours a day and only be out 1
hour a day?
MR. KRAKOFF: They're actually, Your Honor --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If that is generally known,
it would seem to me that that itself would be
sufficient incentive to try and avoid this program,
whether or not you're going to be able to read the
Christian Science Monitor or the New York Times. It
seems to me that the -- the -- what we're fighting
about is trivial compared to the very obvious deterrent
value of 23 hours in the same cell 7 days a week, 30
days a month, 365 days a year. I don't think I'd care
about this other stuff.
MR. KRAKOFF: I agree with that point,
obviously. But every inmate in disciplinary
confinement stays in what is referred to as -- as the
restricted housing unit, and they all know --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, I could say the
same thing about going to jail, I mean, at all.
MR. KRAKOFF: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I could say
whether I'm there 23 hours or all or not --
MR. KRAKOFF: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it's enough of an
incentive that I -- that I don't want to go to jail.
There's -- there's incentives and there's incentives.
MR. KRAKOFF: Yes, but I suggest that -- that
living in a cage and exercising in a cage in -- in
seclusion, that's -- that's a prison within a prison.
And those things deter normal people, people who --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And once you're in
that situation already, as these prisoners are, and
they're still not conforming their behavior to the
prison rules, you have a limited number of options for
trying to get them to do that, and your response to my
first line of questioning was that there's nothing else
you can think of that they could do.
MR. KRAKOFF: At some point, the options
expire. They have taken so much away from these
prisoners. Is that going to then justify? Say, well,
we've taken everything else and this is what we have
left. Is that the kind of situation where deference is
supposed to be high because they're making -- I don't
see that as a real choice. They're doing what they
have available.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your response is
they should just grin and bear it. They --
MR. KRAKOFF: My -- my response is that they
have taken so much away from these inmates who are the
most incorrigible, recalcitrant inmates in the system.
And they say in their -- in their policy that these
inmates are either unwilling or incapable of charging
their -- changing their behavior. I submit that some
of these men probably are, and I think it's also
interesting that they --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- may I interrupt you --
MR. KRAKOFF: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- with this question?
Aren't you really saying that when the deprivations get
beyond some point, some serious point, the issue is not
properly analyzed under Turner and Safley, can they do
one thing more? The issue really becomes one of cruel
and unusual punishment. Is the totality that they have
taken away so great that it is cruel to maintain these
people under these circumstances? Is that the argument
you're really making?
MR. KRAKOFF: It isn't. That's -- that's an
option if one reaches the point where it truly is cruel
and unusual. We didn't file an Eighth Amendment
challenge here based upon the facts that I knew.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I know that wasn't --
that wasn't the claim that you made, but isn't that the
argument that you're making?
MR. KRAKOFF: No. And -- and I think that --
I know in Overton there was a dissent by Justices
Thomas and Scalia that essentially said that that's
what you have. You -- you have an Eighth Amendment
argument if a policy rises to that level, but if a
policy doesn't constitute cruel and unusual punishment,
then you're out of luck. And that kind of swallows up
the First Amendment in my view and the other -- and
other amendments as well.
Now, what I'm suggesting is not that they've
reached the point of cruel and unusual punishment. I'm
suggesting that there comes a time when you take away
so many things from these prisoners, that you basically
-- yes, you may have to give up and you may have to
keep them in segregation. And they do keep men in
segregation -- other forms -- for 10, 15 -- I
represented a man who had been in segregation for 30
years. So it's not as though that's unusual. They do
give up on people in -- in the Pennsylvania prison
system all of the time. That would not be unusual.
I suggest that if we reach the point where
the law says that if you run out of options, you can do
anything that you want as long as it doesn't rise to
cruel and unusual punishment, that we may as well
forget about --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but the State's
position is that it wants to avoid that ultimate
deterrent. It -- it wants to take away privileges for
a while to see if he can conform. You're depriving the
State of the -- of the option to avoid the most extreme
circumstances of forgetting about him altogether
forever.
MR. KRAKOFF: Well, I -- I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that --
that your -- your argument is -- is at cross ends with
its own purpose.
MR. KRAKOFF: Well, it -- unless there are
other questions, I think I've reached --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Just let me just ask one --
one thing I am curious about. The argument -- it seems
to me that there's kind of a flow of these. Some of
them get out of this system and some stay a long time.
What does the record tell us about how often, if they
conform to the regular rules without any violation for
days or a year, do they -- do they get out of this
-- this situation?
MR. KRAKOFF: The -- the rules themselves say
kind of in a preamble that -- that confinement is for a
minimum of 90 days, but that often it's -- it's longer
than that --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not posing what the
rules say. Does the record tell us whether -- you
know, whether this system is just something we're
talking about or whether it really has an effect on
people moving from this classification to another
classification.
MR. KRAKOFF: Well, there were -- there were
inmates in the first 2 and half years of the
operation, according to Deputy Dickson, who had moved
out of -- out of the unit.
The record is silent as to whether any of
these inmates ordered subscriptions for newspapers or
magazines. So we don't know whether that even arguably
was a factor.
I think that the -- that the State has
acknowledged that there might be many reasons why
inmates might leave the Long Term Segregation Unit that
could be unrelated to the -- the, quote, incentive of
newspapers and magazines. So we don't know whether any
of them have left because they've simply gotten tired
of being in segregation for 2 and a half additional
years, after flunking out of the special management
units, or whether there were other -- other factors.
Two -- what -- what is concerning is that two
inmates left straight from the unit to the streets
because their sentences expired. And so they were
essentially people who -- you know, they -- they could
read about the -- an ancient war in the Bible, but they
couldn't read about Iraq. So they were going to have
-- I don't know if that's a healthy situation. That's
not from a constitutional perspective, --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- this --
MR. KRAKOFF: -- but from a practical
perspective.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What other than the
periodical, newspaper access differentiates this
custody from the next higher --
MR. KRAKOFF: Special management unit?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. KRAKOFF: Well, all -- the various
incentives -- there's no possibility of earning access
to radios or televisions in the Long Term Segregation
Unit. The most there can be would be twice a -- twice
a month visits if they're promoted to level 1, as
opposed to four time a month visits if they succeed in
the special management unit. There's no opportunity
for out-of-cell group activities while in the Long Term
Segregation Unit. They lose that as an -- that's not an
incentive. That is an incentive in the special
management unit. There's no probationary period where
they can be released to a general population cell block
which, as the Court knows, a general population cell
block is -- offers many opportunities that segregated
cell blocks don't. And that's not available.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. KRAKOFF: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Rovelli, you have
minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS J. ROVELLI
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROVELLI: Very briefly, if -- if I might
turn myself to just the very first point that Mr.
Krakoff made about inmates being compelled to stay in
the Long Term Segregation Unit until they complete
their disciplinary custody. I would draw your
attention to pages 40 and 41 of the joint appendix,
which show that -- that the unit manager has the
authority to set aside disciplinary custody, and an
inmate who graduates the Long Term Segregation Unit
gets all of their disciplinary custody set aside
completely. So in a sense, the -- the disciplinary
custody aspect is another incentive.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rovelli, do the other
prisoners know about this? I'd like you to respond to
the -- to the assertion that nobody knows about this
anyway, so it doesn't deter anybody.
MR. ROVELLI: The principal means by which
other prisoners would know about it is the very
effective prison grapevine, although it does appear in
the -- in a chart that's appended to the handbook for
the special management unit, and 75 percent of the
inmates who wind up at level 2 come from the special
management unit.
The other thing I would point out about the
effectiveness of this program, as opposed to the give-
up-on-them proposition, is that even at -- even in
02, when the program was only 2 years old, 25 percent
of the inmates who had been sent there had graduated.
The statistics on that are at pages 7 and 8 of our
reply brief.
Finally, if -- if the Court were to affirm
the court of appeals, then this case has to be sent
back to trial and the burden is put on the prison
system to demonstrate empirically that this regulation
can achieve its goals. In a sense, I've just
demonstrated that it has achieved its goals, but much
more importantly, the effect of that would be to
totally undermine, if not void, Turner and Overton.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the
