CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
next in 05-1342, Watters v. Wachovia Bank.
Mr. Blanchard.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOHN BLANCHARD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BLANCHARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The dual banking system of State and Federal
regulation in our nation which we've enjoyed for over
0 years is one of the finest examples of cooperative
federalism in our history. For 35 years, the States,
not the OCC, have prudently exercised their authority
over non-bank State-chartered operating local
subsidiaries of national banks. Indeed, respondent
Wachovia Mortgage complied with Michigan law for 6 years
until in 2003 there was a corporate reshuffling and now
it claims it's exempt from the same Michigan laws it
complied with.
The OCC through its Regulation 7.40006 has
disrupted the careful balance and seeks to deprive the
States of the regulatory authority that they have
historically exercised.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the national bank set
up its mortgage operations as a division or as a
department, then the sole regulator would be OCC, right?
MR. BLANCHARD: That's correct, Your Honor.
But Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Mortgage made a choice.
They made a business judgment to create a
State-chartered operating subsidiary.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did they do
that? What's the advantage to them having that
subsidiary rather than doing this directly?
MR. BLANCHARD: Your Honor, the advantage is
that Wachovia Bank insulates itself from liability,
because it's a bedrock principle of state corporate law
that the parent corporation is not liable for the acts
of the subsidiary corporation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So mortgage
subsidiary could possibly get into some trouble that the
bank wants to protect itself from and not have -- they
have a certain number of assets that are subject to
liability in the subsidiary, but they would -- otherwise
they'd expose the whole bank to those liabilities?
MR. BLANCHARD: Absolutely, Your Honor.
From -- the conception behind operating subsidiaries was
to separate a certain part of the business and the
attendant risks of that business also to separate.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that the
Federal regulating authorities require a certain ratio
of loans to real estate value, things of that sort. And
I assume that the States may have different rules with
regard to that; right? In other words, the oversight
might be different. The States may be more permissive
as to certain loans or as to, you know, what the balance
sheet of the bank has to look like than the Federal
Government is. And if you have a State subsidiary that
is overseen by state authorities, you might have a
different result.
MR. BLANCHARD: Possibly, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if not I don't see
any advantage in this great Federal banking system
you're talking about, if it's Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
MR. BLANCHARD: Well, the States do not --
exclusive visitorial powers over national banks rest
with the OCC. But Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Mortgage
are separate and distinct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not seeking
visit -- "visitorial," is that the word?
MR. BLANCHARD: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not seeking
visitorial rights with respect to the parent bank.
MR. BLANCHARD: Absolutely not.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not arguing
that because you need to see more about the mortgage
subsidiary you need to see what the parent is up to?
MR. BLANCHARD: No.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.
MR. BLANCHARD: No, we're not. Michigan and
the States want to be able to help their citizens with
abusive and predatory lending complaints.
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that it was a
national bank. Forget the subsidiary. And your State
says: Well, we want to have a law here that says we
want to send our own bank examiners in. And moreover,
we don't want them to make any loans in excess of 12
percent interest. Fine. Would that be constitutional?
I mean, wouldn't be preempted?
MR. BLANCHARD: As to the national bank?
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, of course, because it
conflicts and they don't want it.
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Do they have
the authority to say a subsidiary is a national bank?
MR. BLANCHARD: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, they can't? Where is
it in the law that says they don't have the authority to
say that a subsidiary of a national bank owned by a
national bank is a national bank? Is there something
specifically that stops them from saying that?
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: What?
MR. BLANCHARD: The Gold Foods case, the --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is it? What is it --
I mean, what statute or what is it that prevents them
from saying it? I don't know the Gold Foods case.
MR. BLANCHARD: Well, the point is that the
corporate law recognizes the two as separate and
distinct corporate entities.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought your point was
that the statute defines national bank, but also defines
affiliates, and refers to them as two separate entities.
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought your point
was that the effect of this regulation is to simply
eliminate that distinction?
MR. BLANCHARD: You're right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Their argument, they
haven't argued -- I realize this was a hypothetical, but
they haven't argued that the subsidiary should be
treated as a national bank. They're arguing that
they're entitled to say that the same preemption that
--
applies to the national bank applies to the
subsidiaries.
MR. BLANCHARD: Exactly. That's what they
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably, if they
said it's treated as a national bank they would lose the
benefit of the separate corporate existence when it came
to issues of liability. If they said this subsidiary is
a national bank, then presumably the separate corporate
existence they're seeking to take advantage of would be
obliterated.
MR. BLANCHARD: Well, but that's the -- they
are trying to contend that they are one and the same.
But they can't have their cake and eat it, too.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess we can ask
the respondents. But is it your understanding that
respondents take the position that the State has no
control at all over whether or not the shares have been
properly issued, whether or not certain accounting
requirements applicable to all corporations have been
complied with?
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, that is my
understanding of their position.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: They say that there's no
area of State law that is applicable to the subsidiary
corporation?
MR. BLANCHARD: They are saying that
visitorial powers over the State-chartered operating
subs is exclusively --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I could understand that
with reference to just the amount of consumer loans, as
Justice Scalia was talking about. But just to see if
the corporation has a -- had -- had a meeting that year,
has duly elected its officers under State law, do the
respondents take the position you have no authority to
visit the corporation to determine that?
MR. BLANCHARD: They take the authority --
the position that Michigan has no authority to impose on
the State-chartered operating sub the two Michigan
laws --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But let's -- there are
two different kinds of regulations. I think
Justice Kennedy was talking about regulations of a
chartering State. This subsidiary was set up under the
law of a State. It wasn't Michigan. Is there -- is
anyone contesting that --was it North Carolina?
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, you're correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that they have to meet
all the requirements for setting up a corporation and
having meetings and all that that North Carolina
requires of corporations that are incorporated in that
State?
MR. BLANCHARD: No, I've not heard them say
that as to North Carolina law. But what they're saying
is that the Michigan Mortgage Broker, Lenders and
Servicers Licensing Act and the Michigan Secondary
Mortgage Act do not apply to them.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that seems to be a
standard preemption case. It's not as broad as just
visitorial powers generally. Maybe I'm wrong. Do some
subsidiaries of the -- of a national bank do things
other than banking, say title insurance or something
like that? I don't see anything in the record where the
OCC wants to displace the State as to that. This is
just a standard preemption case. When the OCC has
regulations that control, then the State has no
authority to add to those regulations or to have, or to
have contrary regulations. But if it's something that
doesn't have to do with banking at all, then I suppose
they would say -- I can ask them -- I suppose they say
the State has authority to regulate.
MR. BLANCHARD: The important point, though,
Your Honor, is that the OCC has no independent power to
preempt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign
State.
JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't it have exactly the
same power that any other agency or Congress has? That
it has the power, if its regulation is authorized, it
has the power to what they say, preempt a state law that
obstructs, impairs, or conditions a bank's ability fully
to exercise its federally authorized real estate lending
powers? That's what they say, and then they list some
examples.
Suppose they said nothing. Wouldn't we be
in the same boat? After all, a state cannot under the
Federal Constitution normally enact a law that
interferes or stands as an obstacle to the achievement
of the objective of the Federal law.
So if that's right, or if it's wrong,
explain why it's wrong, but if it's right, why don't you
tell me whether the two laws that you are worried about
do or do not stand as an obstacle to the full
achievement of the purposes of the statute as
implemented by their regulation?
MR. BLANCHARD: They do not.
First of all, if the OCC -- if Congress
intends to alter the balance that I spoke of earlier, it
must do so with clear and manifest language. There must
be unmistakably clear language that Congress intended to
authorize the OCC to preempt the state law.
JUSTICE BREYER: Let's assume I don't agree
with you about that, that I think conflict preemption
does not require clear language. Assume that, even
though you disagree with it. Now on my assumption that
you can have the law if it doesn't conflict, but you
can't have the law if it does conflict, so now you
explain to me why the two laws at issue here don't
conflict.
MR. BLANCHARD: Your Honor, in the Barnett
case and in the Atherton case, in order to have the kind
of problem you're talking about, there must be a
significant interference with the business of banking or
an incapacitation of the business of banking. Our
Michigan law doesn't incapacitate what --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Blanchard, may I ask
you a question, perhaps preliminary to what you are
launching into? My understanding was that you did not
question the OCC's regulatory authority over a unit that
it says can do what the national bank itself could do in
the real estate business, no more, no less. OCC
regulation, visitation, all the rest, OCC's regulations
validly applied to this subsidiary that has been set up
in North Carolina and is operating in Michigan; is that
right? It is one thing for you to say we have the
authority to regulate. Are you saying at the same time
that OCC is out of the picture because its dual
regulation conflicts with the inevitable?
MR. BLANCHARD: I am not saying that. What
I am saying is the OCC does not have the exclusive
right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ah, you're saying, you
started to say they can't have their cake and eat it
too, but you're saying they can have the worst of all
possible regulatory worlds, so that they've got two
equally competent regulators, and they have to meet the
requirements of both?
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes. I am saying that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if they don't
want to, they don't have to set up a separate
subsidiary, right? They can do this business directly
as a national bank and they're not going to be subject
to any visitation?
MR. BLANCHARD: You are absolutely correct.
As I started to say earlier, they made that choice and
they came to Michigan, and they obtained a certificate
of authority from the Michigan Corporations Division as
a foreign for-profit corporation doing business in the
state.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And I would
have thought your answer to Justice Breyer was yes, that
they get to regulate to the extent they want to, and the
state does, and if there's a conflict, the federal
regulation will prevail, but what's the problem here is
that they're issuing a categorical regulation saying the
state can't regulate at all.
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes. They are claiming
exclusive preemptive authority.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand that
you made this --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just finish, please?
You argued, as I understand it, correctly, that the
state does, exercises certain regulatory controls that
will not be exercised -- will not be replaced by federal
controls; is that right? In other words, you -- that
they will be unregulated to a certain extent? There
will be less regulation under the federal sovereign than
there is under the state; is that correct?
MR. BLANCHARD: You are correct, Your Honor,
in that Wachovia Mortgage as a subsidiary of a national
bank is a registrant under Michigan law. And as a
registrant, it is not subject to an annual --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can you give me some
specific examples of what Michigan would require that
the OCC does not require? You mentioned licensing, for
example.
MR. BLANCHARD: Michigan would require
Wachovia Mortgage to register. There's a difference
between registration and licensure. As a subsidiary of
Wachovia Bank, they are a registrant like they've been
for the last --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that have any impact
on the way they run their business?
MR. BLANCHARD: No.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, does it make any
difference as a matter of what they have to do in order
to comply with the law that they are now exempt from
Michigan rules and subject to Federal rules instead?
MR. BLANCHARD: No. Michigan just wants to
be able to -- and the other states -- to deal with fraud
and deceit and material misrepresentation in mortgage
transactions, and to have a say over the corporations
that come to their state and do business.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Blanchard, if I could
go back to what you were saying before this last line of
questioning, I didn't understand your position to be
that the OCC can come in and regulate this non-Federal
bank up to the point where its -- well, can do it
apparently without limitation. And where its regulation
conflicts with the state regulation, the Federal
prevails.
MR. BLANCHARD: Or the more restrictive.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ah, or the more
restrictive.
MR. BLANCHARD: That's the difference.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The Federal Government says
you can have outstanding loans of $10 billion and the
state says no, you can have outstanding loans of
billion.
MR. BLANCHARD: No, Your Honor, the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. What happens in that
situation?
MR. BLANCHARD: Well, it doesn't happen in
Michigan because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, invent some other
hypothetical then. I'm talking about a situation in
which the Federal law is more permissive than the state
law. Which law prevails? The Federal law allows this
bank to do things which the state law would not allow it
to do. As I understood your prior answer, you say oh,
of course, if the Federal law allows to it do things the
state law doesn't allow to it do, the Federal law
prevails. I didn't understand that to be your position.
And if it is your position, I don't know what all this
fuss is about. That's the end of the game, isn't it?
MR. BLANCHARD: No, Your Honor. You see,
in -- we do not conduct -- they are exempt from an
examination where we go in and look yearly at such
things as capital assets management, earnings,
liquidity. Those aren't the kinds of things that we're
talking about. They, as a registrant, they are exempt
from that, from an annual examination. They're not
incapacitated, nor are --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Exempt from state
examination?
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes. The state chartered
corporation, Wachovia Mortgage, is exempt under Michigan
law from an annual examination.
JUSTICE BREYER: We're not looking for that.
We're looking for the opposite. As I read this, the
banking agency has not said, we wipe out all of your
laws. They've said, we wipe out a subset of laws, which
are defined as those laws that obstruct, impair, or
limit the ability of this bank to fulfill its federally
mandated powers. Okay? So they're just saying, we only
get the ones that are in conflict. Now, they then have
a list of which ones they preempt and which ones they
don't. So my question to you is, give me a list here of
which ones they think conflict that you think don't.
MR. BLANCHARD: They -- their position is
that both laws that we append to our brief, both laws in
their entirety, are preempted.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Their position is
not that it only preempts in cases of conflict. Under
c apart, 7.4006, it says, state laws apply to national
bank operated subsidiaries, which is what we're dealing
with here, to the same extent that those laws apply to
the parent national bank, which is to say not at all.
MR. BLANCHARD: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not a case
of conflict preemption. They're trying to preempt state
law whether it conflicts or not, right?
MR. BLANCHARD: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You do have -- one thing
that seems concrete and clear to me -- correct me if I
get this wrong -- Michigan is kind of deferring to OCC
in its primary jurisdiction sense. It says customers,
if you've got complaints about what this operating
subsidiary is doing, you go first to the OCC; and then
if we think -- we, Michigan -- thinks OCC has not given
you an adequate response to your complaint, we take
over.
MR. BLANCHARD: You are exactly correct.
That's the Michigan regulatory --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's kind of a reverse
supremacy. Where it's usually the feds that have the
last word, but here you're saying Michigan has decided
that it will let OCC go first and Michigan will be kind
of a supervisor for the adequacy of the OCC's handling
of the consumer's complaint?
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, you are exactly
correct. Our regulatory framework in Michigan says that
the complaint is referred to the appropriate Federal
agency, and only if that complaint is not being
adequately pursued does the commissioner have that
window of investigative authority for her to pursue it.
It is a cooperative type of statute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know another
arrangement where the Federal agency goes first but then
the state agency has authority to say Federal agency,
you didn't deal with this consumer adequately, so we
will take over? I know schemes that work the other way
where the state goes first, and then the Federal
authority, but do you know another one?
MR. BLANCHARD: Another one that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where the primary
adjudicator, decision-maker would be the Federal
authority, but then the state can override that if it
thinks the Federal authority hasn't done an adequate
job?
MR. BLANCHARD: Well, in a sense, in our
statute, the commissioner of the state agency is able to
investigate if the complaint referred to the comptroller
has not been adequately --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the question.
Justice Ginsburg is trying to find out if you know any
other situation where when the Federal agency doesn't do
an adequate job, the state agency comes in?
MR. BLANCHARD: No situations come directly
to mind.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe civil rights actions
where there's a Federal agency that has some remedial
powers and if the Federal agency doesn't act, the
citizen is free to bring litigation in state court? I
guess that would be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or environmental
regulation where just because the Federal EPA doesn't
take a particular action against a polluter, doesn't
mean that the state can't take action against the
polluter.
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't the action an
inadequate action? Michigan is saying yeah, the Federal
authority can do with respect to this unit just what it
would do to a national bank itself, but if we think that
is inadequate, that is a question of just one act or the
other, but if the -- it is the state judging the
adequacy of a particular Federal response.
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the Federal
U.S. Attorney prosecutes, decides to prosecute someone
for manslaughter, the state can decide that's not an
adequate enough response and prosecute them for murder,
right?
MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO: Could the OCC --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Did this go through your --
can I just ask --
JUSTICE ALITO: Sure.
JUSTICE SCALIA: This still goes to the same
thing. Does Michigan do this by grace? If Michigan
wanted to, could it just tell the feds to butt out and
say, you know, all these years we've been letting you
come in first, and we only step in when we think you
haven't done a good job, but we've had it.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: Especially after this
lawsuit, get out, we're going to regulate our state
banks?
MR. BLANCHARD: No, Your Honor. That would
be contrary to the express statutory scheme in Michigan.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I know in Michigan. I'm
saying, could Michigan change its statutory scheme to
kick the Feds out? Or would that be prevented by this
Federal statute we're discussing here? I'm trying to
see what you think this Federal statute does. Or what
the --
MR. BLANCHARD: The Federal rule provides
that the operating -- the State chartered operating subs
are to be treated just like the law pertaining to the
parent national bank. And there is no authority from
Congress given to the OCC that kind of rule. The OCC
only has the authority that Congress gives it, either
through a preemptive statute or through the dell
designation of preemptive authority; and Congress has
not given them that kind of power.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask the question --
the regulatory question. You do not dispute Michigan
does not dispute that the operating -- well, strike
that.
Michigan does not dispute that national
banks can go into business of real estate loans?
And Michigan does not dispute that Congress
has authorized national banks to operate through
subsidiaries for specific purposes like this.
My question is can you give me any plausible
reason to think that Congress would have contemplated
this system of potentially more restrictive State
legislation when its national bank in a given instance
decides to do -- to exercise its Federal banking power
through a subsidiary rather than directly?
Can you think of any reason that Congress
would have contemplated the scheme that you're, that
you're defending?
MR. BLANCHARD: Well, first of all, Your
Honor, I'm not defending that Michigan has a more
restrictive scheme or that Michigan law in any way
incapacitates or significantly interferes with the
business of banking.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if, if -- if the
banks have got, let's say, a subsidiary has to go
through two rounds of bank inspection every year instead
of one round, it is going to cost them something.
Regulation costs the regulated entity something. It is
a burden on them.
And we also have to assume that there may be
instances -- you brought it up -- in, in which the, the
-- the State burden is heavier. So with those
possibilities in mind, can you think of any reason why
Congress in authorizing the exercise of the Federal
banking power through a subsidiary would have
contemplated Michigan or any State would have this
authority?
It seems counterintuitive to me. They're
saying you can -- - you can -- you banks can exercise
the Federal banking power through a subsidiary. It
would seem strange to me that Congress would silently
say, "and, of course, we acquiesce to a -- a dual system
of regulation that would not apply to the bank itself."
What reason would Congress have had for
assuming that might be the result?
MR. BLANCHARD: A recognition that the
States have a sovereign, compelling and legitimate
interest in regulating those corporations that it
charters and that do business within its borders. And
-- and that that balance should be respected.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So it is state sovereign
immunity in effect, is the answer -- State sovereignty
is rather the answer?
MR. BLANCHARD: But the - but the key point,
and I would like to reserve whatever time I may have.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You better hurry
then.
MR. BLANCHARD: The key, the key point is
that Congress has distinguished clearly and
unequivocally between affiliates and national banks; but
it has not included affiliates in either Section 481 or
4 of the National Bank Act.
National banks are not synonymous or
equivalent to the State-chartered operating
subsidiaries.
THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Blanchard.
Mr. Long?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. LONG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court.
I would like to start with the question that
Justice Souter asked because there are some important
principles that are really not disputed in this case,
and I think they help to focus the issue that is before
the Court.
There is no dispute, as we understand it,
that mortgage lending by national banks is supervised
exclusively by the Comptroller of the Currency. And
there is also no dispute that national banks' incidental
powers under Section 247 include the power to make
mortgage loans through a operating subsidiary. And an
additional point is that both Federal statutes and
Federal regulations state that when national banks make
mortgage loans or exercise their banking powers through
subsidiaries they do so subject to the same terms and
conditions that apply to the exercise of the power by
the national --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Blanchard, may I ask
you a question. I just want to understand. Wachovia
has branch banks all over the country. Are they
generally subsidiaries or are they divisions of the
bank?
MR. LONG: Well, a branch of a national bank
has a particular status under Section 36 of the National
Bank Act.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that. I'm
asking a factual question.
MR. LONG: It would not be separately
incorporated. So --
JUSTICE STEVENS: They are actually
divisions, in effect, of the national bank itself?
MR. LONG: Well, I think they are generally
referred to as branches but I think its would be more a
division. That would be --
JUSTICE STEVENS: At least they are not
separate corporate subsidiaries.
MR. LONG: That -- that --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is that, that the Best
bank decided to use the subsidiary approach for this
business, rather than the more traditional banking
approach.
MR. LONG: Well, of course, anything that a
bank does through an operating subsidiary it could do
through the bank. It can always do it through the bank.
But there are many reasons why a bank may choose an
operating subsidiary. They can be managerial reasons;
it's -- just sometimes works better as matter of
business management.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It protects from
liability, too.
MR. LONG: Well, that is one of the reasons.
Although --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in the district.
MR. LONG: I will say, Justice Stevens, I
have not been able to find examples of national bank
operating subsidiaries that have become insolvent. They
are regulated very heavily by the Comptroller and so
they don't.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have a
subsidiary that's in the mortgage lending business that
presumably competes with other companies in the mortgage
lending business that are not associated with national
banks, and you're claiming an immunity from the
regulation that their competitors are subject to. Is
--
that right?
MR. LONG: Well, but again, Mr. Chief
Justice, the national banks compete. And its undisputed
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's fine, and
they have an express provision in 48 -- 484(a) that says
they're, they're exempt from regulation. The question
is whether a separate subsidiary that is not a national
bank that competes with other mortgage lending companies
is immune from the regulation that those other
companies --
MR. LONG: But again, Mr. Chief Justice,
thrifts, S&Ls, State-Chartered banks in all 50 States
are permitted to have operating subsidiaries. It's
recognized not just for national banks, but really for
all types of banking institutions, that are operating
subsidiaries are a useful tool of banking. This is not
a sort of special privilege that's given --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Breyer's
questions were pointing out, to the extent your
regulation -- the Federal regulation of your subsidiary
conflicts with the State law, that regulation is going
to prevail. The question is whether or not you are
immune from State regulation across the board --
MR. LONG: Well, and you asked that
question. I mean, I think it might be useful to think
first about national banks and then about the operating
subsidiaries. It is not true that there are no State
laws that apply to national banks.
This Court's unanimous Barnett Bank decision
is the clearest statement of the principle. Any State
laws that prevent or significantly impair or impede the
exercise of national banking powers are preempted. But
many State laws having to do with contracts --
JUSTICE ALITO: In real world terms, what's
involved here? What are examples of some of the things
that Michigan does or some other State does that impair
or impede the operations to the --
MR. LONG: The beginning is, it is a
complete separate set of regulation. You have to
register or obtain a license. You have to submit to
examination by the regulator. Investigation.
Enforcement. There are substantive laws; Michigan has
some that are not directly at issue in this case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of those laws
might be, I mean, let's say they have a law, when you're
issuing a mortgage to a consumer, you have to give them
a disclosure about how much they're going to end up
paying over the life of the loan and all that. And they
require that of anybody who issues a mortgage in
Michigan. Could that law be applied to your subsidiary?
MR. LONG: Well, the question, Mr. Chief
Justice, would be is it preempted as to the national
bank? The Comptroller of the Currency would say yes.
But the issue in this case is if it is preempted as to
the national bank, then it is also preempted when the
national bank chooses to exercise this power that it has
under Section 24 --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't -- isn't your
friend correct then? You are really trying to have your
cake and eat it, too. You're saying if we did this
without a subsidiary, we wouldn't be subject to that.
But you want to be able to operate through a subsidiary
and yet not be subject to the same rules that apply to
other people.
MR. LONG: Well, but it, it with respect, it
is not really a case of having our cake and eating it,
too. We are in the area of powers of national banks.
And the Court has recognized for a century that in that
area, when national banks have powers, including
incidental powers recognized by the Comptroller, they
generally preempt any State law that prevents or
significantly interferes --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the question I had.
I got somewhat thrown by the Chief Justice's question,
because I thought first, when I read the reg, 34.4.ab,
that those things that are preempted are those things
that obstruct, impair or condition, or in other words
limit, the Federal powers of a national bank.
MR. LONG: That, that is correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: But I thought we were
basically dealing with conflict --
MR. LONG: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- not fielding.
MR. LONG: It's -- that's one level --
JUSTICE BREYER: But -- but the last part of
the reg says that what applies, no State law applies to
a national bank operating subsidiary if it doesn't apply
to the parent bank. And I began to think it fields
preemption. Am I right in thinking that it is conflict
preemption, not field, because it is conflict in the
case of a national bank?
MR. LONG: Well -- it's, it's a very
important point. And our position is there are actually
several ways in which you could analyze this case and
arrive at the conclusion that the Comptroller's
regulations are valid. One is looking simply at
statutory language and saying we would, we the Court
would reach this result as we did in the Franklin
National Bank case even without any regulation. And
second of all is to say the regulations are a reasonable
interpretation of the statute. A third is to say that
the Comptroller has broad rulemaking authority. And as
this Court recognized in De La Cuesta and many other
cases, an agency exercising its rulemaking authority can
preempt State laws even though the statute itself would
not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think, the question is
not whether it can preempt State laws but whether the
rulemaking authority can, can eliminate a, a basic
division of the statute into a national bank and
affiliates of the national bank. The statute makes a
clear distinction between the two. And the effect of
what, of what the agency has to done here is simply to
eliminate that distinction, and to say really it doesn't
matter.
MR. LONG: No. It -- I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If you are an affiliate of
a national bank, you have the same immunity that the
national bank has. That's not what the statute says.
MR. LONG: I have a two-part answer to that
question, Justice Scalia. One is that Section 484 of
the section you're referring to does limit the
visitorial authority as to national banks, but it is
silent as to operating subsidiaries or any other type of
affiliate. States do exercise visitorial authority over
some affiliates of national banks. That's established.
Operating subsidiaries are a special type of affiliate;
4, which was enacted during the Civil War, a hundred
years before operating subsidiaries were authorized,
really doesn't address the question of visitorial
authority.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, an operating
subsidiary is an affiliate, right? What kind of
affiliates did they have before they had operating
subsidiaries? Did they rent pool halls, or what?
MR. LONG: It's a type of affiliate --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought that
any affiliate of a national bank would, would be engaged
in essentially banking business.
MR. LONG: But, but this really became
clear, in answer to your question, in part two of my
answer. In 1999 when Congress enacted the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, it directly addressed this
question of affiliates of national banks. And this is
on page 2A of our appendix. It refers to, it created a
new type of affiliate, for the first time, financial
subsidiaries which can do anything financial in nature.
So they can actually engage in activities that the
parent national bank could not.
But if you look at the bottom of page 2A of
our appendix, this is Section 24A now of the act, it
said that financial subsidiaries can also engage in
activities that are permitted for national banks to
engage in directly, subject to the same terms and
conditions that govern the conduct of the activities by
a national bank.
And then at the bottom of 3A and going over
to 4A where they actually define financial subsidiaries,
they do so by distinguishing them from the operating
subsidiaries which had existed for decades. And at the
top of 4A you see that the operating subsidiary again
engages only in activities that the national banks may
engage in directly and are conducted subject to the same
terms and conditions.
Then if you'll bear with me a moment longer,
on page 12A of our appendix some additional provisions
of GLBA -- actually, that's the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,
GLBA people call it -- said -- this is on 12A -- that
securities activities and insurance activities,
activities that have been traditionally subject to State
regulation, if they're engaged in by a functionally
regulated subsidiary, operating subsidiary or a
financial subsidiary, then they may be regulated by
relevant State securities authorities or State insurance
authorities.
So Congress was actually quite specific.
I mean, your question is about statutory language.  You
don't find this in 484, which is, since it's a century
old, doesn't really get into this. But in this 1999
statute, it's all about subsidiaries of national banks.
Congress was pretty clear if it's securities, if it's
insurance, it can be regulated by States. They were
specific about that. If it's a banking activity that
the bank itself can undertake, it's subject to the same
terms and conditions.
And so, going back to the Chief
Justice's question, you have this question of would it
be a preempted State preempted state law if it were
applied to the national bank when the national bank is
making a mortgage loan. Not every State law is
preempted because not every State law conflicts. But if
it does --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What authority
do you have for the proposition that when then Federal
law says subject to the same terms and conditions that
they're referring To State regulation as opposed to the
same Federal regulation that applies to the national
banks?
MR. LONG: Well, I mean, we have section
.4006, which is the 0CC's regulation interpreting that
language in the statute and in its own OPSUB
regulations, section 5.34. And we also relied simply on
the ordinary meaning of "terms and conditions." It
means prerequisites, limitations.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was 7.4006 issued
pursuant to -- what did you call it, GLBA?
MR. LONG: GLBA?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Or did it
predate that?
MR. LONG: 7.4006 was issued pursuant to
-7, which is this incidental powers provision, and
(a), which I've just been walking you through, which
is a provision of GLBA. So it is based partly upon
GLBA, and it is an interpretation of the same terms and
conditions language.
JUSTICE BREYER: Conflict preemption
basically strikes down a State law that stands as an
obstacle to the full enforcement of the Federal law.
MR. LONG: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, with that
in mind, suppose that you didn't have either 7.4006 or
.4(a)(B). Neither existed. But we listened to what
the agency said as a Court and they explained how the
regulation worked. Would you expect to come to
precisely the same result?
MR. LONG: Well, I mean, of course --
JUSTICE BREYER: Would you or not?
MR. LONG: We do have them and we think that
makes the case easier, of course.
JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but would you --
would you expect to come to the same result or not?
MR. LONG: Yes. We would say that if you
start with 24-7 and the incidental powers of national
banks and the undisputed point that one of those
incidental powers is for the national bank --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does it conflict
with Federal banking authority for the State to audit
the books of the mortgage subsidiary?
MR. LONG: Well, it has been established
since the beginning of the national banking system
that -- and this goes back to the history of the first
and second Bank of the United States in McCullough
against Maryland -- that the national banking system is
protected from possibly unfriendly State legislation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Take my earlier case
about the consumer disclosure. Michigan has a law, I
assume, that any mortgage lender has to tell the
consumer all this information. Would that conflict with
the authority of a national bank?
MR. LONG: The Comptroller's view as I
understand it is that it would. But again let me
emphasize --
THE COURT: How?
MR. LONG: Because --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think any
regulation would conflict with the national bank status?
MR. LONG: Well, I think that may go too
far. But I think what Comptroller has done, it has --
has been to look at a series of these State regulations
and determine whether in fact they do impair or impede
the exercise --
THE COURT: I'm trying to get a handle on
it. As I understood the case that came, I don't think
there's disagreement on either side about how conflict
preemption works. But I thought your position was that
more is involved here and that the State can't regulate
it at all, and you're not getting into a conflict
preemption question. It's just if it's a State
regulation it can't --
MR. LONG: I think our position is there are
multiple roots that we can win this case. One is based
on conflict preemption. Another --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But you do take a field
preemption position, don't you?
--
MR. LONG: Yes, of course. And another
route is simply that the agency has --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, it's truly broader
than just conflict preemption.
MR. LONG: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Literally.
MR. LONG: Yes. And the agency has broad
rulemaking power. It's exercised it here. There's
really no dispute about what the OCC's rules mean. The
only question is whether they're valid and then what is
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your best case for
the proposition that an agency and not the Congress
defines the extent of field preemption?
MR. LONG: That an agency and not the --
certainly the Delaquesta line of cases stand for the
proposition that if an agency has preempted State law by
regulation, the questions are simply whether the agency
has acted within the scope of its delegated authority
and whether it is a reasonable accommodation of the
conflicting principles and whether there's any reason to
think that Congress would have disagreed with it. Are
there -- I mean, there are examples. For example, in
the world of Federal thrifts OTS has a sort of field
preemption as I understand it. It's evolved differently
in the world of national banks. That's conflict
preemption.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What is a functionally
regulated subsidiary of a depository institution.
MR. LONG: Well, that that again goes to
this scheme of GLBA that I was trying to describe. The
notion that Congress had is that you're going to
regulate by function. So if it's insurance, the State
can regulate it whether it's in the subsidiary or in the
bank. If it's securities, the SEC and in some
circumstances the States can regulate it. But if it's
core banking functions like mortgage lending, that's
going to be regulated subject to the same terms and
conditions that apply when the bank itself conducts
those activities.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And is that a functionally
regulated subsidiary?
MR. LONG: Yes.
JUST SCALIA: If it's just engaging in
banking activities?
MR. LONG: That is the concept as I
understand it. It's going by function and we think that
shows actually Congress did --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Does Wachovia have any
branch banks in Michigan?
MR. LONG: Wachovia does not, although -- I
mean, an interesting feature of the Michigan law is if
they did Michigan's law would not apply, which we think
is not consistent with their view that the OCC is an
inadequate regulator, because it would be exactly the
same whether or not there's a branch.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Are there States in which
Wachovia has both branch banks and subsidiaries
comparable to this?
MR. LONG: Yes, yes. North Carolina and
others.
I will add, there was a point at the
beginning that this Wachovia Mortgage Company actually
was regulated by Michigan for 6 years and there were no
problems. During that period it was a subsidiary of a
bank holding company, and that's a completely different
situation. Those are not regulated at all by the OCC.
So of course they were regulated by Michigan. That's
the way subsidiaries of bank holding companies are
regulated. That's simply a different situation.
If there are no further questions, I will --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Long.
Mr. Srinivasan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUSCURIAE,
SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
Let me begin by addressing this question of
whether what's going on here is conflict preemption or
field preemption. Now, it depends on how one defines
those terms. But as we understand it it's conflict
preemption, not field preemption, in the following
sense. Our position is not that State laws have no
application to operating subsidiaries or to national
banks for that matter. It's that State laws apply to
the same extent to operating subsidiaries as they would
to national banks. And as this court has made clear in
the Atherton case and in the Barnett Bank case, State
laws do apply to national banks and operating
subsidiaries in a variety of respects, and State
contract law would be an example. But with operating
subsidiaries in particular, State laws dealing with
corporate governance questions, for example the process
of incorporation, dissolution, shareholder voting, and
things of that sort, would be controlling and so federal
law doesn't control those sorts of aspects.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's field
preemption when it comes to regulation. Yes, if the
bank is sued the normal rules of contract are going to
apply for enforcing a contract. But you're claiming
field preemption with respect to regulation, correct?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I guess it depends on
the degree to which the regulations apply to the
national banks. That's my only point, is that State
laws apply to the same extent to the operating
subsidiary as to the national bank.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: State laws generally
-- State agencies generally don't regulate national
banks at all, right?
MR. SRINIVASAN: State agencies don't
generally do that because there's a specific statutory
prohibition on that. And Justice Scalia, this goes to
your questions about the scope of these provisions at 12
U.S.C. 484(a) and 481. It's true that those provisions
say by their terms that visitorial authority resides
exclusively with the Comptroller of the Currency with
respect to national banks, and there's another provision
that deals with affiliates.
And so that's the point with visitorial
authority. But visitorial authority by its very nature
is asserted in service of and enforcement of some
underlying substantive requirement, and the underlying
substantive requirement at issue here is the requirement
that operating subsidiaries register with the State.
And so there's a question of conflict preemption that
applies both to the national bank and the operating
subsidiary of whether that underlying substantive
registration requirement could be applied to the
national bank or could be applied to the operating
subsidiary.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it is true, is it
not, that as long as this mortgage company was a
subsidiary of a holding company rather than the bank
itself, the State would have done the visiting, the
visitorial power, whereas once they changed the Federal
Government assumed that responsibility?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't know what you
mean by "holding company," Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, as your co-counsel
pointed out, previously this very company was a
subsidiary of a holding company that also owned the
bank, and at that time it was exclusively regulated by
Michigan.
MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, because it
wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered
national bank.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And the change in the
corporate structure is the sole basis for saying now
it's exclusively regulated by the OCC?
MR. SRINIVASAN: It is, but it's changing
the corporate structure in a fundamentally important
way. That's that it's no owned and controlled by a
federally chartered national bank.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But this results in field
preemption to the extent that the exercise of visitorial
power is a regulatory function?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, again it depends on
how one defines those terms. And I don't take issue
with the fact that as a consequence of the fact that
this became a subsidiary --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it is now only the
Federal agency that does the visiting, whereas it used
to be only the State agency?
MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And the question that led
me to is how many additional personnel did OOC employ
when it took over this area for 48 States?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't have an
empirical answer to that question.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it was certainly quite
a few people, I assume.
MR. SRINIVASAN: But Justice Stevens, in the
regulatory materials that attended the promulgation of
these rules OCC specifically addressed the question
whether it had sufficient resources to exercise
oversight authority over operating subsidiaries of
national banks. And let's be clear. It's not that the
OCC previously had no authority over operating
subsidiaries. The question is whether the OCC has
exclusive authority over operating subsidiaries. And
the OCC determined in the regulatory materials that it
had sufficient resources to exercise oversight authority
over operating subsidiaries --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the authority under
the old regime was just to make sure that the operation
did not affect the financial stability of the parent
bank.
MR. SRINIVASAN: But that's because it
wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered
national bank, and that changes things in a fundamental
way for the following reason: That under the Barnett
Bank case the rule of preemption, the special rule of
preemption that applies in the context of national
banking, is that when you're dealing with enumerated or
incidental powers of national banks -- and one
incidental power of a national bank is undisputed to be
the power to conduct affairs through an operating
subsidiary -- that the grants of those powers are
normally preemptive of rather than preempted by State
law> And so once the operating --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was an effort
of the State to prohibit the national bank from engaging
in the activity, correct?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that was. But the
Court --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an obvious
case of conflict preemption. Here we have a question of
whether or not the State can regular the operating
subsidiary to any extent.
MR. SRINIVASAN: But the Court's decisions
aren't limited to prohibitions of that sort. I'd make
two points in that regard. First of all, in one sense
this is a prohibition, because the operating subsidiary
can't engage in federally authorized activities unless
and until it gets the State's permission. So at least
there is a prohibition at the outset. But more
importantly, the Court's cases aren't limited to
situations involving prohibitions of the sort that Your
Honor posits, because in the Franklin National Bank case
that was a situation in which the national bank had the
power to accept savings deposits and the State law that
was deemed to be preempted there didn't prohibit the
national bank from accepting savings deposits.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What comes next? Can the
OCC say, well, the corporate law of this State doesn't
really allow subsidiaries to do as much as we think a
subsidiary of a national bank ought to be able to do, so
we're going to attribute additional corporate powers to
this subsidiary? Can it do that?
MR. SRINIVASAN: No, not if you're talking
about corporate powers, because those are governed by
State law. What it could do, though, is regulate the
subsidiary's conduct of the business of banking,
because, after all, an operating subsidiary has one
purpose and one purpose only, and that's to carry out
functions that the national bank itself could perform.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What troubles me, and maybe
you can answer to it more specifically than you have, is
that the core function of a banking regulatory agency is
the visitation power, and the Banking Act makes it very
clear that there is visitation power to national banks
and makes it very clear that there is not for
subsidiaries.
And here is a regulation which under the
guise, it seems to me, of defining the powers of the
national bank simply eliminates that distinction. And
it seems to me that perhaps goes beyond what an agency
regulation is allowed to do.
MR. SRINIVASAN: With respect,
Justice Scalia, I don't think the statutes say that at
all. There is a statute, 484(a), that says that the
OCC's visitorial authority is exclusive with respect to
national banks. But there is no statute that says that
the OCC's visitorial authority is not exclusive with
respect to subsidiaries. There's another statute that
deals with affiliates. Now one point is that affiliates
are not limited to subsidiaries, but they could include
for example, I guess brother and sister corporations for
lack of a better term, that are controlled by a common
parent. But another point is that at the time these
statutes were enacted, Congress simply didn't have
within its field of vision the notion that a national
bank would have the power to exercise its functions
through a subsidiary corporation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why should we assume
that they wanted to preempt state laws to that extent.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Because what Congress was
trying to do is to make sure that the OCC had exclusive
visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of
national bank function. It's just at the time that
these statutes were enacted, the only play that national
bank functions were being conducted was by a national
bank itself. Now later on, when the laws of all 50
states, the OTS, the Federal Reserve with respect to
state member banks, and the comptroller gives banks the
authority to conduct national -- to conduct bank
functions through its subsidiaries, then this issue
arises about who exercises visitorial authority with
respect to the conduct of those functions for a
subsidiary. And it stands to reason that if the
baseline rule is that with respect to the conduct of
national bank functions through a national bank itself,
the OCC visitorial authority is exclusive, then when a
national bank exercises its Federal entitlement to
conduct those very same functions through an operating
subsidiary, the OCC's visitorial authority, likewise,
would be exclusive. That seems to me to be an entirely
reasonable regulatory determination by the comptroller,
and there's nothing in those statutory provisions that
speaks directly to that issue and that in any way
precludes the comptroller from reaching that
determination.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Practically, is there any
difference between the way they operated when they were
just a corporation as before, and now a parent and sub?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, there could be. I
don't know about this particular case but there
absolutely could be, Justice Ginsburg, because when they
become subsidiaries they are controlled by the national
bank and not by some other entity. And the reason that
a national bank would choose to engage in this sort of
structure rather than folding the enterprise into the
bank itself are many fold. And in part it's for
efficiency purposes because you can have focused
management, especially when you're dealing with the sort
of specialized things that operating subsidiaries
typically do. But there's also other reasons. For
example, there's a modularity component to this in the
sense that the best specialized functions such as
mortgage lending, very often a national bank will
purchase an entity that conducts that activity, and may
be interested in selling the entity later, and it's much
more straightforward to do that if those functions are
maintained in a separate subsidiary corporation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any aspect
of state law, including liability limitation, that they
want to take advantage of by establishing a subsidiary
chartered under state law, Michigan or another state,
and yet they're claiming immunity from all other state
regulations?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, with respect to
liability limitation in particular, Mr. Chief Justice, I
should clarify that veil piercing principles and things
of that sort would be governed by state law with respect
to the operating subsidiary. So if the question is
whether the corporate veil is pierced, state law would
dictate an answer to that question.
But, may I just finish one thought?
States won't have an incentive to liberally
construe veil piercing principles with respect to
national banks precisely because state member banks in
all 50 states also have operating subsidiaries through
which they charter banks to conduct banking functions.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Blanchard, you have a minute remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOHN BLANCHARD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BLANCHARD: Two key points.
First, Section 484 and 481 have been amended
subsequent to the time operating subsidiaries came into
play. Congress knew of operating subsidiaries when it
amended 484 twice in the 1980s, and 481 was amended four
times. Yet, never did Congress insert the word
"affiliates" into the exclusive power of the OCC in 488.
Secondly, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act is
being greatly distorted. The same terms and conditions
language that my opponent referred to was meant to
return op subs only to the authority that the parent
bank could engage in. It wasn't preemptive or meant to
preempt the states. The comptroller had issued a
ruling, 34.F, (f), and they had allowed operating
subsidiaries to do things differently from the parent
bank.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Blanchard. The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the
