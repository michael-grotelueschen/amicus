CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 105 on our original docket,
Kansas v. Colorado.
General Six.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. SIX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Article III makes a clear distinction
between the Court's appellate and original jurisdiction,
and expressly grants Congress power to make exceptions
and regulations for appellate jurisdiction, but Congress
is not granted the same power over original
jurisdiction.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an extremely
sensitive clause in Article III. We can decide this
case without relying on the distinction you just
discussed, can't we?
MR. SIX: Well, I think can you, and the
Court certainly can interpret the statute not to even
reach the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and
avoid that constitutional conflict. And I think the
stronger reading of the statute arrives at that very
result.
The statute at issue, the cost provision, 28
U.S.C. section 1920, states: "A judge or clerk of any
court of the United States may tax as costs the
following." And it lists six subparagraphs, including
subparagraph 3 at issue here, Fees and Disbursements for
Printing and Witnesses.
The statute has two terms in it that are
defined, "judge" and "court of the United States," and,
importantly, one term in 28 U.S.C. section 451 that is
defined but does not appear in the cost provision, and
that is "Justice of the United States." "Justice of the
United States" is defined as "the Chief Justice and the
Associate Justices of the Supreme Court." The cost
provision says "a judge." "Judge of the United States"
is defined as including judges on the court of appeals,
the district court, the Court of International Trade,
essentially the listed courts and the Article III
judges.
JUSTICE: But, on the other hand, "court of
the United States" is defined specifically to include
the Supreme Court. So you have a contradiction no
matter which way you flip it. On the one hand, it says
"judge," which does not include the Justices of the
Supreme Court. On the other hand, it says "court of the
United States," which does include the Supreme Court.
So why should we pick one -- one answer to the
contradiction rather than the other?
MR. SIX: You don't have to pick. And
you're correct, "the court of the United States" is
defined to include the Supreme Court. But the strongest
reading of the statute gives meaning to all of the words
in the statute, and it says you can be a judge who
appears in the court of the United States. And if you
think about it, there's a circle of judges that are
defined here and a circle of courts that are defined
here, and where the two overlap, where you are both a
judge and in the court of the United States, the statute
should apply.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about --
MR. SIX: And that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It also says
"clerk." We may not be judges, but we certainly have a
clerk.
MR. SIX: You do, and 28 U.S.C. section
11, another provision in Title 28, specifically deals
with the Supreme Court Clerk. And throughout title 28,
the Supreme Court is treated differently than the lower
courts.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is 1911 a stand-alone
provision that would justify relief for you, or do we
have to also refer to the general cost statute?
MR. SIX: I don't think the Court would
refer to the general cost statute in its original
jurisdiction cases at all or any authorization from
Congress. 28 U.S.C. 19 --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but let's assume
that we think Congress can control this, this issue,
this question. Now, I'm asking if 911 isn't a
stand-alone section so that you can interpret it without
reference to 1920.
MR. SIX: I mean, I would -- if your
assumption is Congress has the power to do it and has
done so through 1911, I read 1911 more as simply a grant
of the discretion the Court already has. They are
turning over to the Supreme Court the power to have the
clerk set costs.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I think this case is
controlled by 1911, do I have to refer to 1920?
MR. SIX: No. I don't believe you have to
refer to 1920.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't you rest your
case just on 1911?
MR. SIX: Because in the original
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Congress isn't given
power to make exceptions or regulations over original
jurisdiction. And in the 219 years of the Court's
original practice, they have never referred to a
congressional cost provision, and --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that 1911
doesn't cover expert witness fees because it's not
included within the term "other necessary
disbursements"?
MR. SIX: I believe the expert witness fees
in this case were vital to the resolution. They were --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were they within 1911?
MR. SIX: I don't believe they were other
incidental disbursements. That's not our position.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other necessary
disbursements.
MR. SIX: Other necessary disbursements.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Incidental to the case.
You don't that think that covers expert witness fees?
MR. SIX: If -- if this Court determines
that Congress has the power, and it's done so through --
since 1911 -- has the power and done it from 1911, I
certainly would accept that position as the result.
However, I would point out to the Court that I think the
expert witness costs and the work was vital to the
resolution of the case here.
JUSTICE ALITO: If you're reading of the
statute is correct, then I take it we would have the
discretion to decide what would be appropriate expert
fees. Is that correct?
MR. SIX: Absolutely.
JUSTICE ALITO: If that's so, why shouldn't
we exercise that discretion by saying that the expert
fees that are available in case of the original
jurisdiction of this Court should be the same as the
expert fees that would be available in a district court?
Maybe they are too low in the district court, but why
should there be -- why should we as a discretionary
matter, if we have the discretion, provide for radically
different fees depending on the court in which the case
originates?
MR. SIX: Clearly the Court has the power to
make that rule for original cases. However, the
original jurisdiction was developed when the States
agreed to submit and ratify the Constitution, submit
their sovereign immunity to resolution in the original
jurisdiction to handle unique disputes between the
sovereign States. And as the Court said in Florida v.
Georgia in 1854, "The analogies and rules and
foundations of law that apply to private parties are not
necessarily a good fit for sovereign States.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but Justice Alito is
saying we have discretion, we look for guidance, we have
guidance from Congress. They have adhered to the $40 a
day limit in very important cases; why don't we just
say, Justice Alito is suggesting, that this is -- that
this is a good guidepost for us and we will follow it?
MR. SIX: Because what Colorado's position
is that they are telling you that the Special Master's
hands were tied; that the Special Master couldn't even
exercise that discretion in a bright line rule that
would save $40 a day.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: We are saying it's our
discretion and our discretion is guided by what Congress
has suggested so there is uniformity in the system and
so forth.
MR. SIX: Clearly, the Court would have the
power to do that. However, there has only been
approximately 200 original jurisdiction cases in the 219
years of the Court. To suggest that the rules --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In all those -- in all
those cases has the Special Master ever called a court's
witness, that is a court's expert, appointed a court's
expert, and if so what is the pay rate for such a
witness? I mean, courts of the United States, district
courts, occasionally appoint witnesses, court witnesses
as distinguished from party's witnesses. Do you know if
that's happened in Special Master situations?
MR. SIX: I can tell you it didn't happen in
this case. I certainly can't speak to whether it's
happened in other cases involving special masters, so I
don't know the answer to that. Certainly 1920 makes a
distinction for court- appointed experts rather than the
expert witnesses appearing under subsection 3 of 1920.
I think the important point to consider,
though, is in the original jurisdiction the Court in its
9 years of developing essentially an interstate common
law in these cases has never relied on the trilogy of
cost statutes that the court discussed in Crawford
Fitting, with is I essentially Colorado's position: You
have to apply Rule 54D first to have the court even have
the discretion to award costs; then you get to 1920,
which the Court said is the arena of costs; and only
after that do you get down to 1821, which tells you
you're limited to $40 a day.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: How do Special Master fees
work? The Special Master always has fees and the
parties I think usually divide them. How does that --
how is their authority to order them --
MR. SIX: Sure. Rule 53 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure deals with special masters in
the lower courts. It has no application here and wasn't
used. The Special Master's fees, which total
approximately a million dollars, just shy of that, were
resolved by the parties after the Special Master was
allowed to exercise discretion on that area of cost.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what if they hadn't
-- what if the parties hadn't resolved it?
MR. SIX: If they hasn't resolved the
Special Master's --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. How would the -- how
would the Special -- what would be the authority of this
Court to make an order that the Special Master be paid X
dollars?
MR. SIX: Well, I think the authority of the
Court comes from the order appointing the Special Master
to handle the case and to do the specific things that
were --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. We just, we just
regressed one step. Where does the authority come from?
MR. SIX: To appoint a Special Master?
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
MR. SIX: It's an inherent authority the
Court has in original jurisdiction cases.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So that the authority to
compensate is inherent?
MR. SIX: The authority to compensate is
inherent. In the Judiciary --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you making -- would you
make an inherent authority argument here?
MR. SIX: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of original
jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction, would you say
that this Court simply has the inherent authority to, to
in effect to decree these sorts of claims.
MR. SIX: Well, again there is a distinction
between appellate and original and, focusing on
original, I think the Court has entirely the authority.
The Judiciary Act of 1789, which gave the Court
exclusive jurisdiction over these disputes, didn't set
forth any procedures to govern the disputes. That's
always been carefully preserved to the discretion of the
Court to apply each unique case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: General Six, under your
reading of the statute, 1934 particularly, would the
Court have authority to charge your fees to your
adversary, shift attorney's fees?
MR. SIX: Yes. In the original jurisdiction
the Court would have the inherent authority to do
fee-shifting if the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Did you make such a
request in this case? Why should -- why should
attorney's fees be treated differently from expert
witness fees? Let me put it that way. Or should it be
treated differently?
MR. SIX: The Special Master should have the
discretion to consider all the costs and unique
circumstances of the case. In this case we chose expert
witness fees --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We should have the
discretion. Why do you keep talking about the Special
Master? He's just -- he's just our amanuensis.
Ultimately it's our discretion, isn't it?
MR. SIX: It is, and the benefit of having
the Special Master make a recommendation is we could
have gone through these different categories of costs
and come up with a recommendation. The Court certainly
could have learned --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it the usual
practice is for the parties to settle this matter and
submit an agreed amount to the Special Master; is that
correct?
MR. SIX: The way it's worked in this case
is the Special Master has provided guidance, like on the
Special Master's fees. The Special Master suggested it
wouldn't be unfair to award them two-thirds Colorado,
one-third Kansas. After that the parties resolved it,
just like we resolved every other issue of cost where
the Special Master was allowed to apply that discretion.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why didn't -- -
then are we here? We are talking about limited amounts.
So much more is at stake on the merits and why wouldn't
the parties just say, well, when it comes to Special
Master fees this is what we are going to agree to. It
doesn't have to be limited to $40. You can agree as
part of a global settlement to whatever you want.
MR. SIX: Well, the Special Master's fees
we resolved. The experts fees at issue here, of course
that bright-line rule was drawn by the Special Master
and he never was allowed to make a recommendation to the
Court to consider that. In balancing -- the remedies in
these cases are highly equitable remedies.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you just answer my
question of a moment ago. Why should expert witness
fees be treated differently from attorney's fees?
MR. SIX: Well, in this case they should be
treated differently because the model at issue that the
experts for Kansas developed, the HI model, was used to
prove our claims at trial, which would have --
JUSTICE STEVENS: You used lawyers to prove
your case, too.
MR. SIX: Excuse me?
JUSTICE STEVENS: You used lawyers to prove
your case, too. Why should they not be compensated?
MR. SIX: Because we considered the special
circumstances of the model. It proved the claims at
trial. It was adopted by the Court in 2004 in Kansas v.
Colorado to monitor compliance in the Arkansas River
Basin. It's the water use -- it's applied by the
Colorado State water use rule. So it was special
features like that that we wanted to present to the
Special Master to explain why the fees should be fairly
balanced and divided in a way other than he did.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't understand that to
be an answer to why he didn't also ask for attorney's
fees.
MR. SIX: Well, in a particular case where
perhaps a order of the Supreme Court wasn't followed or
some other situation developed, fee shifting may be
appropriate. In this case we felt the expert model we
developed was so vital that it would be persuasive to
the Special Master and fair and equitable to award it to
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know whether any
other -- you didn't know, in answer to my last question,
what the practice had been, but with respect to expert
fees in other original jurisdiction cases, has the Court
ever deviated from the $40 or when it was $30, $30?
MR. SIX: In original cases the Court has
never referred to any of that trilogy of cost statutes
discussed in Crawford Fitting.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But have they ever
approved a Special Master's recommendation of a rate for
the expert witness that deviates from the $40?
MR. SIX: I think the answer to that is yes
and I would direct the Court to New Jersey v. New York
in 1931, which was a division of the waters of the
Delaware River. And the Court pointed out in that
opinion that a mass of evidence was presented to the
Special Master, and on costs the Court said: "The cost
of the cause shall be divided 35 percent to New Jersey,
to City of New York," and so on. The "cost of the
cause" I would argue is the cost to get the case to the
point where it was resolved. In the boundary dispute --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know -- do you
know whether there were expert witnesses in that case?
MR. SIX: It does not say in the published
opinion exactly what the cost of the cause is. However,
from a fair reading of the -- the water distribution
issues, I wouldn't imagine it would be possible to do
that without experts. But I would point the Court to
the boundary dispute cases where the Court has discussed
the costs of surveyors, mappers, geographers,
historians, and divided the cost in boundary disputes
equally between the States -- not each State to bear
their own cost, but divided them equally.
And the -- the experts that are involved in
resolving a boundary dispute, I think, are no different
than the hydrologists and engineers and the type of
experts that we used in this case.
JUSTICE BREYER: You're right. They are all
different. They did a lot of work on that. I -- I know
they did a lot of work on this. Congress has a statute,
and the statute is: We don't care if the witness is
Albert Einstein, Steven Spielberg, or the local
zookeeper. Okay. We don't care. We don't care if they
did a lot of work or a little work. We want them to be
paid $40 a day, period. It's too much trouble to figure
out how much work they did. That's what we want.
That's the law.
Now, Justice Alito said: I agree with you
for argument's sake; we are not bound by that rule. But
I take it his question, which I heard no answer to, is:
Assume you are right; we are not bound by the law;
still, why shouldn't we follow it?
MR. SIX: Because in the original cases the
Court has always tried to reach an equitable balance --
JUSTICE BREYER: Have do you any example
where Congress had a statute which says every court in
the United States must pay da-da-da, whatever that
number is; it's $382.50, okay. Now, despite that clear
statute, this court for exactly the same thing paid a
different amount. Is there any such case?
MR. SIX: I'm not aware of that.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And is there
anything in the -- in the nature of litigation? And
there might be. I'm not asking it as a rhetorical
question. Is there anything in the nature of original
jurisdiction lawsuits that, as a general matter, would
call for higher fees to be paid for witnesses, or to
make a distinction between expert witnesses and others,
or to do other things that would complicate it?
I'm not speaking of your case. You have a
wonderfully strong case in your case. I want to know
about in general, in original actions.
MR. SIX: I would suggest the only
difference is the parties. And the Court in its 219
years --
JUSTICE BREYER: If anything, the parties
are in a better position to pay the money than the
average person.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume -- I assume
your answer is that it's -- that it's our business, and
we don't have to agree with Congress; that we -- we may
think $40 a day for the zookeeper and for Albert
Einstein is ridiculous. And, therefore, if it's up to
us, we would adopt a different rule. Isn't that your
answer?
MR. SIX: That's exactly my answer. And if
you think -- if Congress can adopt a congressional --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure that
answer is -- is at all adequate. Number one, what is
there, as Justice Breyer pointed out, that's so
different about this case?
Let's say one landowner secretly and
intentionally is stealing another landowner's water, and
-- and he has no legal right to do that. And the only
way the injured landowner can recover is to hire a very,
very expensive expert, a hydrologist. And by the time
he goes to court, he is really going to lose the benefit
of the damages. Congress has said too bad. That's the
way it is.
Why isn't it that way with States,
especially, as Justice Breyer said, when States can
really afford the -- afford it better than the
landowner. What's the difference?
MR. SIX: The difference is the Court has
indicated for original cases: These are such disputes
of a serious magnitude that can affect whole populations
that the model case for even taking a case is where the
acts between the States would be a causus belli, a type
of thing that would lead to war.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I haven't seen -- I
mean the $40 limitation makes absolutely no sense, does
it? I mean I never saw an expert who would agree to
spend the day appearing in court worth being called an
"expert" for $40.
I mean the fact that -- I guess I'm just
repeating Justice Scalia's question. The fact that
Congress has picked an arbitrary number with no basis in
reality doesn't mean that we should do the same.
MR. SIX: I would agree. The special
master 's fees, for example, for one person -- and he
was an excellent special|master -- were almost a million
dollars. The appearance fees for the 22 experts Kansas
had amounted to approximately $30,000. So that
different there, I think, demonstrates the very
unfairness --
JUSTICE BREYER: It's not unfair to have a
rule which says each party pays his own experts, win or
lose. That's the rule, isn't it?
MR. SIX: I don't think that's the rule in
original jurisdiction cases. At least the Court has
never said that. The Court has --
JUSTICE BREYER: If you lose this case, if
we were to follow Congress, we would have adopted a rule
where, because the $40 is trivial, each party pays his
own experts. Is that right or wrong?
MR. SIX: I think that's correct, but we
didn't lose. And the Court found that Kansas proved
that Colorado violated a compact for over -- for over 50
years by clear and convincing evidence. But one point
I'd like to make --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, can we do this then?
I think maybe in many cases that are technical in nature
it might be quite a good thing for the losing party to
pay the winning side's lawyers.
MR. SIX: The Court would have that ability
to do that in original jurisdiction --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, should we do that,
too? If we are going to have them pay the experts, why
don't we have them, the losing side, pay the lawyers'
fees? That would be quite a revolution.
MR. SIX: Because in the original
jurisdiction cases involving prevailing parties or
litigious cases, the Court has traditionally and
historically awarded the prevailing party costs. And if
Congress can make a congressional limitation on cost,
Congress could pass a statute that says: You have to
take all original jurisdiction cases, or you can't use
special masters, or you can't use certain special
masters in cases involving Colorado and Kansas.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you save that for the
lower courts? I mean, you are -- you are trying to
distinguish what it can say for the Supreme Court when
the Supreme Court is the trial court vis-a-vis what it
can say, and has said, for the lower courts.
MR. SIX: Yes, It could say that for the
lower courts.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?
MR. SIX: Because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that, so long as
Congress could not create the lower courts at all, once
it creates them it can -- it can tie their hands to any
sort of absurd rules?
MR. SIX: I think they could pass a rule
like they did, Rule 54 -- 53, which allows for special
masters, and they could through the Rules Enabling Act
pass a rule that says you can't use special masters. I
think you get into whether that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I just don't agree
with your assumption that just because Congress need not
have created any lower Federal courts, the only Federal
court required by the Constitution is this Court,
therefore once Congress creates them, it can do whatever
it wants with them. I -- I don't agree with that.
MR. SIX: Well, I would certainly focus more
on the original jurisdiction issue here and haven't
focused as much on that issue, but --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When we award the --
the special master's fees in original cases, do we
specify who will bear those fees?
MR. SIX: Yes, you do. In -- you do in the
cases that have discussed costs. For instance, in
boundary dispute cases you have suggested that the cost
-- the costs will be divided equally; in litigious
cases, that they will be awarded to the prevailing
party.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we include the
special master's fees as part of the costs that are
allocated?
MR. SIX: Yes, and in this case the parties
have agreed to that and never made an issue about that.
And there is no --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why -- why did
the parties agree to it if we do it? In other words, if
we say in our orders who bears the special master's
fees, why -- why would the parties agree to it?
MR. SIX: Well, in this case -- maybe I
misheard your question. The order appointing the
special master did not resolve the issue of fees.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
MR. SIX: And the parties did not agree to
that ahead of time. It was an issue to be determined
and decided at the end of the litigation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it -- isn't it
customary for it to be divided 50/50? I mean, we
periodically will approve the fees that the special
master charges and then they are divided between the
parties. And I thought that they were divided 50/50.
Is that not so?
MR. SIX: Well, as the case progressed, the
special master submitted bills that were divided 50/50.
At the conclusion of the case the parties suggested
reasons and special circumstances that should allow the
special master to apply discretion.
He then suggested it wouldn't be unfair to
award the special master fee costs two-thirds Colorado,
one-third Kansas because of the unique features of the
case. And the parties then settled the special master
fees with that guidance.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, I think you
gave the answer earlier. Rule 53 allows for the -- an
order to say that one or both parties shall pay the
special master fee. So if we are going to follow other
analogies, we don't have much problem here with expert
witness fees -- pardon me -- with special master fees.
It's under Rule 53.
Of course, you say we don't have to follow
that as a model, but it is a model if we -- if we were
to look to congressional and -- and to other rules.
MR. SIX: It is a model; however, the Court
has always carefully preserved its discretion to treat
each dispute between the sovereign states as a unique
dispute. And the Court never even enacted an original
action rule until 1939, so after 150 years. And in 1939
the Court enacted Rule 5, which just set up the bare
minimums of commencing the action. And Rule 17 today
has essentially the same framework that tells the
parties how to start the action but reserves all the
other rules to the discretion of the special master.
It does point to the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure and the Rules of Evidence as guides but not
binding, mandatory rules that tie the Court's hand.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What is magical about
original actions? I mean, what -- what is magical is
that we are the only court that is required by the
Constitution. But we are -- we are not just the only
court for original actions in -- in -- in all appeals.
Can Congress prescribe division of costs and expenses in
the appeals that come to us from the lower Federal
courts?
MR. SIX: Well, the Court has, in 1913,
determined that -- excuse me, in 1912, that when a case
is affirmed, the Supreme Court can adjudge costs for
damages and delay. So they have directed, I think, a --
a regulation at the appellate jurisdiction, but never at
the original jurisdiction.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean Congress
has done that?
MR. SIX: Congress, I'm sorry.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my
time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.
General Suthers.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. SUTHERS
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. SUTHERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The special master in this case found clear
direction from the statutes and rightly so. Section
21 of Title 28 is unambiguous. It provides that a
witness in attendance at any court of the United States
shall be paid an attendance fee of $40 per day in
addition to travel and accommodation allowances.
Section 451 of Title 28 defines "court of
the United States" to include this Court, the Supreme
Court of the United States, and that definition has been
part of the statute since 1948. Because witness fees
are only at issue in the Supreme Court in cases of
original jurisdiction, it's apparent that Congress
intended the limits set forth in 1821 to apply in such
cases.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what if they said
in original actions no fees shall be allowed to any
special master appointed by the Supreme Court?
MR. SUTHERS: Chief Justice, it would then
be up to the Court to decide whether that's somehow an
intrusion into your --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we allow -- if we
allow Congress to regulate fees in our original
jurisdiction in that matter, it seems to me that we've
given up the principle and we are just negotiating over
price.
MR. SUTHERS: It would not be the first time
that you've allowed Congress to legislate some aspects
of your original jurisdiction. Congress has told you in
what is now Section 1251 that your original jurisdiction
is not entirely exclusive. Only State versus State is
exclusive, and all the rest of your jurisdiction is
nonexclusive.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't this an area,
though, where we should be particularly sensitive? In
other words, one reason that we were given original
jurisdiction in these cases is that the States were
afraid of what Congress would do in its own courts, the
courts it set up -- might set up under the Constitution.
I think it would be surprising if you told
the States at the framing that Congress gets to regulate
this original jurisdiction where you, for example, can
sue the Federal Government, that -- I think that would
be surprising. It would not be regarded by them as a
significant safeguard.
MR. SUTHERS: Chief Justice, if it was such
a sensitive issue, why is it we are now in 2008 and this
Court has never decided to enact any kind of rules --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we don't know -- -
General Suthers, do we know what has happened in past
original jurisdiction cases? Maybe it hasn't come up
because other special masters have said, we'll give the
expert witness a reasonable fee for services
commensurate with the qualifications and the work that
the expert has done. We don't know if that has or
hasn't happened in the past, do we?
MR. SUTHERS: Justice Ginsburg, we -- we
looked at it very carefully -- and it's difficult to
research -- but we could not find an original
jurisdiction case where there was an award of witness
fees outside the -- this $40 per day limitation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you find any cases
where the special master had appointed his own witness
as distinguished from the parties?
MR. SUTHERS: No. We did not. But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but you
recognize that if a special master appointed a witness,
or the court, that that witness would be paid a
compensatory fee?
MR. SUTHERS: Whatever the special master
determined was appropriate. That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, in a -- in a case
like this one, where the nature of the work that the
expert did seemed to be very helpful to both sides,
isn't it odd that the special master chose the court
expert, that expert would be compensated fairly but if
you have one party calls an expert who renders great
service to the Court, to both sides, doesn't get
compensated? Isn't that an anomaly?
MR. SUTHERS: The special master, Justice
Ginsburg, found clear direction from the statute and did
not believe that he had an option in the matter, if
you're talking about the unfairness of it. Number one,
this situation here is no more unfair to Kansas than any
litigant in Federal court. And number two, it's
appropriate matter to take to Congress.
The last time they changed it was 1990 from
$30 to $40. I think it's time to revisit it. But it
is, in fact, what Congress has dictated should be the
compensation --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a matter of
unfairness to Einstein anyway. I mean, you know, the
expert witness is going to get his money.
MR. SUTHERS: That's correct, Justice. They
certainly did in this case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The question is --
MR. SUTHERS: Both sides can vouch for that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The question is whether one
side can get some money from the other to help pay for
Do you happen to know whether at the time
the original jurisdiction of this Court was established,
there was such a thing as the charging of expert witness
fees?
MR. SUTHERS: Justice Scalia, I do not. We
do know --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't either.
MR. SUTHERS: -- that it's 1853 when for the
first time Congress, desiring to have uniform fees,
began the structure of expert witness fees. It started
at $1.50 a day, in 1853.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- may I ask you a
statutory question just about the application of the
statute. As -- as you have pointed out, if the $40
applies it's because I -- it is, in effect, a
determination of a particular item under section 1920:
Judge and clerk of any court of the United States may
tax its cost. My question is this. One of the items
covered by 1920, one of the items that a judge or clerk
may tax, is fees of the clerk.
Under section 1911, which relates entirely
to the Supreme Court, there is a provision that the
Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its
clerk. That is totally redundant if 1920 covers the
Supreme Court of the United States.
Doesn't it follow, therefore, that section
20 was -- despite its reference to any court of the
United States, doesn't it follow that that statute was
not intended to apply to the Supreme Court; and doesn't
it follow from that that either the Supreme Court's
authority is to fix the fees if this is a fee to be
charged by the clerk or, in the alternative, that there
is no statute on it at all?
But the main point is unless 1911 is totally
redundant in -- in referring to fixing the fees to be
charged by its clerk, then 1920 must not cover the
Supreme Court.
MR. SUTHERS: Justice Ginsburg, 1920 --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm greatly flattered.
(Laughter.)
MR. SUTHERS: Justice Souter, Justice
Souter, sorry. Justice Souter.
JUSTICE SOUTER: You're not the first to
have done that.
(Laughter.)
MR. SUTHERS: 1920 there may be some
redundancies in it, but it's much more expansive than is
11. It talks about court reporter fees, printing --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, we didn't -- no
question about that. I recognize 1920 goes a lot
further. But there is no -- there is no need in 1911 to
say to that the Supreme Court may -- may fix the fees to
be charged by its clerk if the Supreme Court is already
covered by 1920.
MR. SUTHERS: Justice Souter, I think if you
look at the history of it, 1911 was enacted at the
same -- there is a separate statute -- statute that
applies to the court of appeals and to the district
courts. I think it's like 1913 and 1914. So I -- I --
I don't think that you can --
JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, if it's
redundancy it proves too much is what you're saying?
MR. SUTHERS: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. SUTHERS: I think the important thing
about 1911, in response to Justice Kennedy's question,
it is limited to fees charged by the Supreme Court
clerk, cost of serving process and incidental
disbursements. It does not address witness fees in --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think it includes
printing fees?
MR. SUTHERS: 1911 does not, unless --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't -- you don't
think that --
MR. SUTHERS: Incidental disbursements?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what number here? You
don't think that 1911 would allow the clerk to charge
for printing fees?
MR. SUTHERS: As an incidental disbursement,
it may. But it clearly does not address witness fees.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the reason I ask is
because printing, in 1920, printing and witness fees are
in -- in the same sentence.
MR. SUTHERS: And I -- I don't know whether
printing would be considered incidental disbursements.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So if you allowed
printing, then I think it would allow witnesses under
11. Citing Crawford Fitting, this Court made clear
that no statute will be construed to authorize taxing
witness fees and costs, unless it refers explicitly to
witness fees.
JUSTICE BREYER: It is -- I mean, if you
want to really get a little complicated, the -- you
have -- you have 11, and 11 talked about the Supreme
Court fees and then we have 20 and that talks about all
the other fees, right? Okay. So the thing is, you
can't pay money in the United States unless have you
some authorization, but 1911 gives the Supreme Court
some authorization to fix fees.
Now we look back at 1821. And 1821 tells
you how much mileage per diem and subsistence will be.
It says he will be paid an attendance fee of $40 per
day. Doesn't say you couldn't pay him more. Just says
that's what he is entitled to. Now of course, in the
lower courts, you can't pay him more because there is no
authority to pay him more. But in the Supreme Court,
there is authority to pay him more. That comes out of
11.
I mean, I grant you that this is -- what I'm
actually doing here is I'm trying to avoid this problem
of whether Congress can start legislating the details of
original jurisdiction rules and so forth. Just -- there
is some desirability here constitutionally to prevent
ourselves from going down that road. That's -- I'm
deliberately being gimmicky, but what do you think of
this gimmick?
MR. SUTHERS: Well, not much.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: That's fair.
(Laughter.)
MR. SUTHERS: This Court -- this Court
decided three cases regarding the application of 1821.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes.
MR. SUTHERS: Cases in which litigants, like
Kansas, were trying to get around, in Federal court,
this witness fee limitations, starting with Crawford
Fitting. In that case you held that the prevailing
seeks -- who seeks reimbursements for fees paid to its
own expert, is limited by the statute unless we're
talking about a contract or express statutory --
JUSTICE BREYER: Which part did they think
limited it? Was it 1821 they thought limited it?
MR. SUTHERS: Yes. And by the way, there is
a contract here.  It's the compact between, the 1949
compact between Kansas and Colorado, and --
JUSTICE BREYER: In an ordinary case, if a
witness -- doesn't -- never does go to court, but just
goes to a deposition, that's the only thing, he goes to
a deposition, does he get paid the 40 dollars? He goes
to a lawyer's office; he's never in attendance at a
court. But Do they count that as being in attendance at
a court?
MR. SUTHERS: I don't believe so, Justice
Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: Then where is his --
MR. SUTHERS: It's liberally construed.
JUSTICE BREYER: What?
MR. SUTHERS: It's liberally construed. You
don't have to --
JUSTICE BREYER: If that isn't attendance at
a court, where did these witnesses show up?
MR. SUTHERS: These witnesses show up for
trial.
JUSTICE BREYER: Where? Where do they have
this proceeding? I don't know; it wasn't here; it
wasn't in this --
MR. SUTHERS: It was in California.
JUSTICE BREYER: Where?
MR. SUTHERS: Pasadena, California, for 272
days.
JUSTICE BREYER: In the courthouse?
MR. SUTHERS: Yes. Tenth Circuit Court of
Appeals. They show up; they are in attendance; it's not
just on the stand; all they time they're there, all the
time they're travelling back and forth; it is liberally
construed.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask. Just to put
one thing on the table if I could. How do you deal with
the problem that Justice Ginsburg raises: If a court
wants to appoint an independent expert and pay him more
than $40 a day? Do you say that's flatly prohibited?
And if it's not flatly prohibited, what is the authority
for doing so, other than 1911?
MR. SUTHERS: Justice Stevens, nothing
prevents higher compensation for a court-appointed
expert. We are talking about --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But what authorizes it?
Doesn't 1911 authorize it?
MR. SUTHERS: I don't believe 1911 does.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then what does?
MR. SUTHERS: The inherent authority of the
Court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Then why don't you have
the inherent authority to pay expert witness fees a
little more money, then?
MR. SUTHERS: Because the statute addresses
that. It does not address --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The Constitution says that
no money shall be -- shall be withdrawn from the
Treasury except by appropriations made by law. I think
-- I think you need a law to spend -- to spend the
government's money.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You're not spending the
government's money; you're spending the litigant's
money.
MR. SUTHERS: Well, in the case of the -- of
the Court appointing an expert, it is typical at the
conclusion of the case as part of the cost for the judge
to determine what was an appropriate award the losing
party -- what they should pay as part of that expert's
expense. But that's not what we are dealing with in
21.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about -- I mean
now, as long as I'm starting down the road to outer
space, why not -- could we say, look, they were very
impressive models these people did; on both sides they
had terrific experts, very expensive; and would we have
the authority to say to the master, although you didn't
treat them as your experts, you should have done, for
purposes of paying them.
MR. SUTHERS: Justice Breyer, you are the
Supreme Court and if you found that this statute --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to be
unreasonable about this.
(Laughter.)
MR. SUTHERS: Yes. If you found that this
statute was an intrusion which somehow violated your,
you know, authority as a Court, you could do that. But
why would you want to get into the business -- going to
Justice Alito's point -- you have so far refrained from
enacting your own rules on this highly procedural matter
of expert witness fees.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we would want
to get into the business because it's our business; and
it seems to me that if you yield on a basic point like
this, that you're giving up, who knows how much?
MR. SUTHERS: Justice Roberts, I'm not --
you have done it before in -- in highly procedural
matters where you do not -- no one here is doing
anything that prevents your exercise of original
jurisdiction, that expands your exercise of original
jurisdiction. The cases also say that your original
jurisdiction is self-executing, doesn't need any
statutory implementation; but this is a -- a totally
procedural matter, much as -- in fact, I think less of
an intrusion, when the -- when the Congress said to you
these cases will not be exclusive jurisdiction. Even
though they are part of your original jurisdiction.
This is a very procedural matter.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask you what --
what are the fees to be charged by its clerk, referred
to in 1911. "Supreme Court may fix the fees to be
charged by its clerk," and then the next paragraph says
the fees of the clerk. Is that what the first paragraph
refers to, the fees of the clerk? Or does it mean other
fees that the clerk charges which could include costs?
Are the costs part of the fees to be charged by the
clerk?
MR. SUTHERS: I don't believe so, Justice
Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They are not? Fees of the
clerk -- in 1920 says fees of the clerk in Marshall, but
that could be taxed as costs. Right? A judge or clerk
can tax as costs the following.
11 says Supreme Court may fix "the fees to
be charged by its clerk," and you say that doesn't
include costs. Boy, it's a messy, messy bunch of
statutes, don't you think?
MR. SUTHERS: Not -- not a whole lot more so
than others I've seen.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --
MR. SUTHERS: By the way --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's some comfort.
MR. SUTHERS: -- it has been pointed out to
me in this compensation of court-appointed experts that
that is specifically addressed in section 1920,
paragraph 6, compensation of court-appointed experts is
covered there. So there is that statute authority which
you indicated there should be.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that taxes costs,
and it doesn't say the Supreme Court may fix costs. May
fix the fees to be charged by its clerk, which you say
don't include costs.
MR. SUTHERS: I don't believe they do.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So that wouldn't allow to
us fix that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Except 1911 may do two
things. Number one it may authorize the Supreme Court
to fix the fees to be charged by the clerk. And then in
the second paragraph it for taxing of those fees, the
cost of serving process and other necessary
disbursements; so it does two things.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it tells you how they
are to be taxed. It doesn't say what their level is to
be. May be taxed against the litigants as the court
directs, but I don't see any authority to fix them --
fix the amounts. It's not a very good statute, really.
MR. SUTHERS: If I may, once again going to
the issue of why I think some uniformity is important in
original jurisdiction cases, is because so many of the
cases are not exclusive jurisdiction; and there is in
fact a need for uniformity here; and the fact that this
Court has not chosen to issue a conflicting rule, I
think is very significant.
If in fact you had set an appropriate fee
for expert witness fees in case original jurisdiction,
and Congress came along and said gee, no; it shouldn't
be that, you should be stuck with $40, then we might
have some kind of a constitutional issue here; but
absent that, I simply don't --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if
Congress had done nothing? In other words, let's say
they haven't addressed costs at all. Would we be able
to set what we think are reasonable attendance costs?
MR. SUTHERS: I would concede that you --
you probably could. But --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Pursuant to what
authority?
MR. SUTHERS: Your inherent authority over
original jurisdiction cases.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we have
inherent authority over original jurisdiction cases, how
does it -- how come it disappears whenever Congress
decides to legislate in the area?
MR. SUTHERS: Because Congress is
entitled -- you've recognized their right to deal with
certain types of issues. I find it very interesting
that Kansas cited Ford v Georgia, because that case says
Congress has undoubtedly the right to prescribe the
process and mode of proceeding in original jurisdiction
cases as fully as in other Federal courts, but that the
omission to legislate such process does not deprive the
Court of its constitutionally conferred jurisdiction.
If this is something you have historically --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is a substantive
level of fees a mode of proceeding?
MR. SUTHERS: Chief Justice, I would argue
that the setting of fees is a procedural matter; and it
is -- and has to do with the mode of proceeding in a
case. That's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any -- do
you think $40 a day for an expert is a realistic
assessment of what experts charge?
MR. SUTHERS: Absolutely not, Chief Justice.
And in fact, of course, as I think Justice Breyer
pointed out, Einstein does not only get $40 a day. We
pay them a lot of money; but Congress has decided $40 is
what they -- what they get. Congress ought to revisit
it. There is no question about it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Parties pay a lot -- a
lot of expenses and then they may be -- may or not be
reimbursed to the prevailing party; but the prevailing
party in our system certainly doesn't get anything like
the full cost of the litigation.
MR. SUTHERS: That's correct, Justice
Ginsburg. They certainly do not. Experts in this case
were paid lots and lots of money, and they don't even
get that when the court has -- it's not -- at least the
trial courts --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe lawyers get even
more.
MR. SUTHERS: That's right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you don't get that back
either.
MR. SUTHERS: That's exactly right.
JUSTICE SOUTER: May I just get clear on
your view of inherent power? As I understand it, you're
-- when you answered it, in a situation in which the
slate is completely clean, we would have inherent power,
you're using "inherent power" in effect to be a kind of
default power. If Congress hasn't acted, somebody has
got to do something. That's got to be us, so -- so we
would have the authority. But you are not using the
term "inherent power" in the sense of being a power
which is sort of essential and indefeasible by Congress
in any respect. Is that correct?
MR. SUTHERS: That's correct, Justice
Souter, to the extent that there was nothing applicable
to this and it came before you, should expert witnesses
get compensated some -- some amount, Congress hasn't
spoken on it, I would think, as a matter of default, you
could say yes. And -- but --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you think there is --
there is any inherent power in, let's say, this Court --
just keep to it simple -- that Congress in effect could
not eliminate? For example, if Congress passed a
statute saying the Supreme Court of the United States
shall not have authority to punish direct contempt,
would that statute be constitutional in your view?
MR. SUTHERS: No, Justice Souter, it would
not be because then it's interfering with your ability
to do what courts do as a central matter.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that a pretty
slippery slope then that you're on? Because if in fact
parties are going to be reluctant to -- to hire the kind
of experts that are necessary, unless they think that at
the end of the day there is going to be some kind of an
equitable disposition of the expense, at that point that
starts interfering with the conduct of the kind of
business that the Court ought to be engaged in.
MR. SUTHERS: Justice Souter, it's not
telling you how to decide cases. And there is another
case before the Court in which Congress reinstated
time-barred cases. That's the kind of thing that
intrudes on your judicial function. Setting witness
fees doesn't come close to doing that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What if Congress -- really
you think Congress could set any -- there's not some
point at which it is so destructive of the process here?
What if Congress provides that the winning -- that the
winning party shall pay the costs of the losing party?
Can Congress do that?
MR. SUTHERS: It's -- I think the question
would be, Justice Scalia, is that a fundamental
interference with the Court's ability to decide cases?
I would suggest it might be to the -- did they do
something wholly irrational like that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But that would be a matter
of due process, not a matter of inherent power, I take
MR. SUTHERS: I believe that's correct.
That's correct.
Members of the Court, Special Master
Littleworth spent a lot of time on this case. He has
been fair, competent, and conscientious in resolving all
the issues before this Court, including this issue of
expert witness fees. It was the plain language of the
statute and the clear direction of the case law that led
him to his conclusion that the expert witnesses' fees
were limited by statute in this case. We would ask you
to deny Kansas's exception to the final report, and that
the Court should enter the proposed judgment and decree.
Mr. Chief Justice. If there are no other
questions from the Court, I'll conclude my argument.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.
General Six, you have four minutes
--
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. SIX: 1920 didn't appear in 1948
magically. It came from the 1853 Fee Act. And the
language in the Fee Act was, "A judge shall tax costs."
"A judge" -- it says, "Costs shall be taxed by a judge
or clerk of the court." I'm sorry. And 1920 says, "A
judge or clerk of any court of the United States." In
53, as the Court has discussed in Alyeska Pipeline,
the Fee Act applied to the circuit courts. It says that
in its title. And "judge" in 1853 meant a lower court
judge. In 1920, we have exactly the same word -- "a
judge" who can tax costs -- and we have a definition
that Congress tells us it means exactly the same thing.
Under Colorado's reading "court of the
United States" would expand to read "judge" right out of
the statute, and it would make the statute apply to
"magistrate judge," for example, which is not included
in the definition, but they're somebody who wears a robe
and presides over a court of the United States, and it
would apply to Justices, even though 451 in title 28
defines "Justices" as a separate group. So that's not
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Constitution uses
the word "judge." A "judge of the United States" is a
Supreme Court Justice or a judge of an inferior court.
MR. SIX: And certainly Congress isn't tied
to the way the word is used in the Constitution, no more
than the paper I got on my way in here told me not to
refer to any of you as "judges."
The point, I think, is that the Fee Act was
carried forward to 1920, and the language is almost the
same. The only thing they have added is a definition of
"court of the United States." And if after 168 years,
Congress is going to tread on the Court's original
jurisdiction, they ought to at least have some express
language that they intend to do that -- do so, where the
Court could at the very least adopt a clear statement
rule that would require Congress to say, "We are going
to do this now. We've never done it in our history, but
now after 168 years we are."
Not only that, Colorado's position relies on
the fact that they did this in 1948, and it's gone
unnoticed by the Court, any major treatise, or
commentary --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. I got mixed up
on my dates. The words "in any court of the United" --
what the words are now is "in any court." It says
"court of the United States includes" in 451 courts.
--
When did that language come in?
MR. SIX: In 1948.
JUSTICE BREYER: In '48?
MR. SIX: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: So the inclusion wasn't
there till then. Now, normally, in the '48 revision,
the rule is they intended to make no substantive change.
When they did intend to make a substantive change, they
said as much. So is there anything in the history of
that that suggests they intended to make a substantive
change here?
MR. SIX: No, there isn't. And they changed
JUSTICE BREYER: No?
MR. SIX: They changed --
JUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, the
language "in addition to the courts listed in section
1 of this title," that -- those words I just said have
no appearance in the statutes before 1948? Yes or no.
MR. SIX: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: They do appear before?
MR. SIX: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, they do not.
MR. SIX: First time in 1948.
JUSTICE BREYER: First time in 1948. So
they were put in there by a revisor.
MR. SIX: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: And there is no indication
the revisor intended to change the meaning that
pre-existed.
MR. SIX: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I got the argument.
Thank you.
MR. SIX: And they did change something
else. They changed "shall" to "may," and they gave a
reason for that change.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in the
