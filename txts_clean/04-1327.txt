CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
next in Holmes v. South Carolina.
Mr. Blume.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BLUME: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please
the Court:
In this case, the South Carolina Supreme
Court took the second of two recent steps that
dramatically curtail a defendant's ability to create a
reasonable doubt as to his innocence by presenting
evidence that another individual committed the crime.
The first step came in 2001 when, in State v.
Gay, the court held that the admissibility of third
party guilt evidence was dependent on the strength of
the prosecution's case.
The second step, which occurred in Mr.
Holmes' case, holds that third party guilt evidence is
inadmissible whenever the prosecution has presented
strong forensic evidence of the defendant's guilt.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, there's some dispute as
to whether that -- that is really what -- what it held.
And there's a big difference. If -- if you just say
whenever you -- whenever the prosecution has a strong
case, you can't introduce other guilt, or whether all
that the court is saying is that one of the elements
that you consider in determining whether to admit this
-- this third party is not just -- it's the comparative
weakness of the third party case. You don't blind
yourself to -- to the strength of the prosecution's
case.
Will you say it was bad even if it was the
latter that the court was -- was referring to? Are you
saying you cannot consider the strength of the
prosecution's case at all in determining whether to
allow in third party guilt evidence?
MR. BLUME: Yes, Justice Scalia, I am. It's
not necessary for a ruling in our favor in this case.
It's not contingent here because at a minimum, the
South Carolina Supreme Court rule here in describing
it, they said in State v. Gay we held that in cases
where there is strong evidence of guilt, including
strong forensic evidence, evidence that a third party
committed the crime is not admissible. That is a
categorical rule of exclusion no matter how you cut it.
But even if you deemed that there is some
discretion left in the system, it is still
unconstitutional because what the South Carolina system
requires is a reasoning backwards, that the
admissibility of evidence of the defendant's innocence
is conditioned on the judge's assessment of the
likelihood of the defendant's guilt.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I suppose that
in a purely discretionary system -- I -- I can't quite
think of the hypothetical -- the strength of the
prosecution's case may bear on the assessment of
relevance and materiality as to the evidence the
defense wants to introduce. If -- if the evidence of
identification is -- is quite clear -- is quite clear
-- and then there's some witness of marginal
credibility that says he was in another city, I think
that may affect the trial court's balance.
I -- I take the thrust of your point, that
the strength of the case makes it more important to
introduce the third party evidence, not -- not less. I
-- I take that point. But just as -- as an absolute
rule, I'm not sure that the strength of the case is
always irrelevant. That's what I'm saying.
MR. BLUME: I think that it is possible that
under some circumstances not the strength of the
State's case but the evidence as a whole may shed some
light on whether the third party guilt evidence is
relevant. For example, if the uncontested evidence is
the crime occurred on Tuesday, January 3rd, and the
third party guilt evidence shows that the third party
was in Acapulco on January 3rd and had no possibility
to be there, that's not a strength issue. That is
relevance.
But when the touchstone for admissibility is
whether the defense evidence overcomes the
prosecution's case -- and in the South Carolina rule
for -- just to be clear, it's not even considered that
you consider the evidence of guilt. The defense
evidence of third party guilt has to overcome the
prosecution's forensic evidence.
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that everything in
this case were the same. Everything is identical
except what the court of appeals or the State supreme
court holds is that we think under rule 403, which
happens to be the rule in our State, the probative
value doesn't warrant admissibility in light of the
risk of prejudice. But everything else is the same.
MR. BLUME: If the South Carolina --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, in your opinion is that
constitutional?
MR. BLUME: Just to make sure I understand
it, if the South Carolina Supreme Court in this case on
these facts had said this was a 403.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. BLUME: No. I think that would be
unconstitutional --
JUSTICE BREYER: Because?
MR. BLUME: -- under this Court's decision in
Olden v. Kentucky that this Court has recognized that
evidentiary rulings, based on the strength of the
evidence in this case, can be arbitrary and capricious
and deprive a defendant of --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what they'll say --
MR. BLUME: -- his right to defense.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- if they want to build it
out, is they'll say, look, there -- there is DNA
evidence here. It's absolutely conclusive, and all
that the light -- the -- the only doubt of the -- the
defense has cast on it is they found that there was
some opportunity that the police could have tampered
with it. That's true of 60 percent or so of all chain
of custody cases, and that is not sufficient to
overcome what it shows. And therefore, it's not worth
the jury's time and it'll prove very confusing to the
jury.
Now, why would that ruling under 403 be
unconstitutional?
MR. BLUME: Well, that ruling in this case
would be unconstitutional because it would be a
mischaracterization of what Mr. Holmes' evidence was.
JUSTICE BREYER: Good. Now, that's what I
want you to get to.
MR. BLUME: Challenging the DNA evidence.
That is not the -- the state of the evidence in this
case, but --
JUSTICE BREYER: And the key points that
suggest that what I just said is not a fair
characterization or a correct characterization are?
MR. BLUME: That the evidence in this case --
that even the FBI agent who testified for the
government admitted the DNA could have been placed
through the incompetent handling of the evidence by
Officer Mobley, that without gloves and with all the
evidence in his possession, he inventoried the items,
including Mr. Holmes' clothing and the victim's
clothing, stuck his hands in the bag, determined what
was in there without washing them or gloves, stuck his
hand in another bag, determined what was in there. And
even they admitted that due to the very small amount of
DNA that was recovered, that Officer Mobley's actions
could have been the source of the DNA on the clothing.
In addition to that, there were a number of
other suspicious activities, including Officer Mobley
locked everyone else out before he inventoried,
processed the scene. And then there were problems with
contamination there.
And then at the bottom -- at the end of the
day, the defense presented a DNA expert, the only non-
forensic scientist, but the most qualified scientist in
the case from the New York University Medical School,
and he said, look, this DNA doesn't mean anything.
There are things that science cannot explain. There
are dye globs here which should not be present.
There's also a spike that does not belong to Mr. Holmes
or --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, where --
where in the record is the testimony of the FBI agents
that you were referring to?
MR. BLUME: It's -- it's in the joint
appendix. The -- the agent which admitted this was
Agent Baechtel. I think it's actually in the joint
appendix, page 249, but I'm not positive of that, and
counsel will look for it.
But there was also their defense expert who
said that the bottom-line results were unreliable. So
at the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- what about
the DNA -- the exclusion of the alleged perpetrator, of
White? There -- there was no trace of White's DNA.
And that was a FBI officer who testified to that.
MR. BLUME: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I don't
find that surprising at all, given the facts of this
case. It's, you know, seek and ye shall find, or don't
seek and ye shall not find. In this case, they took
none of Jimmy White's clothing to test to see if there
was any incriminating DNA on that. They didn't take
his shoes, even though they had the shoe print.
This was not a case in which the DNA pointed
to a single perpetrator. There were no vaginal swabs
or rectal swabs which contained any information of any
value whatsoever.
And by the time they finally got around to
doing the DNA testing in 1996, numerous items of
clothing, including several items belonging to the
victim, had disappeared and no one could explain where
they had went. So the fact that they didn't find Jimmy
White's DNA on Bobby Holmes' clothing I think is of no
significance whatsoever.
The main -- one of the main thrusts of the
defense case here was because of the incompetence or
the malfeasance of the police officers in this case,
that the evidence against Holmes was unreliable.
MR. BLUME: Mr. Blume, I -- I know you're
more concerned about -- about what result you get in
this case and -- and whether your client gets another
trial or not. I am more concerned about -- about the
rule of law that we're going to apply in the case which
will affect a whole lot of other trials, and I -- I
frankly think we're playing with fire. I -- I worry
about criminal trials turning into circuses in which --
in -- in which the police are put on trial, which is
part of what is happening here and what has happened in
-- in a famous recent American case. I worry that --
that that will be the -- the result if -- if we take
your suggestion, which is to prescind from any
consideration of the strength of the prosecution's case
and simply look at the -- at the alleged third party
guilt evidence on its own without -- without any
consideration of its relative -- its relative strength.
Just -- you want us to do it just absolutely.
MR. BLUME: Well, I would say, Justice
Scalia, that that's the way the 49 other States do it.
South Carolina is the only State which has a rule
which requires a defendant to overcome the
prosecution's case. And in South Carolina, not only do
you have to overcome the prosecution's case, the only
thing that counts is the prosecution's evidence. They
completely dismiss --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where do you
think it says you have to overcome the prosecution's
case?
MR. BLUME: In the Holmes opinion.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a -- it's a
factor that's considered in weighing the admissibility
and relevance of the third party guilt. They don't --
you don't have to prove and rebut and overcome, as
you've said a couple of times, the prosecution's case.
MR. BLUME: The -- the holding in Mr. Holmes'
case is Holmes simply cannot overcome the forensic
evidence against him.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But with respect, I --
isn't the -- the term that they use -- and I was going
to ask essentially the same question. The term that
the court uses is raise a reasonable inference of his
innocence. And I will -- I will grant you this. When
I read that, it said -- I thought to myself it sounds
as though they are saying he must present evidence or
make a showing, a preliminary showing, that it is more
probable than not that he is innocent despite the
State's evidence. But they never spell that out, and
is it spelled out anywhere?
MR. BLUME: Well, there has not been a -- a
decision since then. But I think if you read the
sentence before that in the opinion where it says --
they describe the Gregory rule, which was the old rule,
with which we have no quarrel. The rules are similar
to that in other jurisdictions. It says, further, we
held in State v. Gay that in cases where there is
strong evidence of guilt, especially forensic evidence,
evidence of third party guilt simply is not admissible.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say you
don't object to the -- the Gregory standard, and the
Gregory standard is the one Justice Souter just quoted,
raise a reasonable inference as to his own innocence.
Now, how can you tell whether it raises a reasonable
inference in a vacuum without regard to the evidence on
the other side? If the evidence on the other side is
-- I understand you dispute it in this case, but let's
say unobjectionable DNA evidence that your client was
the person there, and his third party guilt evidence is
it wasn't me. How can you tell whether that creates a
reasonable inference or not without looking at what's
on the other side?
MR. BLUME: Well, I -- I think because, one,
if you do that, you could supplant -- you -- you have
made the judge the jury, and the defendant, in order to
present evidence of his innocence, have to -- has to
win a trial before the trial -- before the judge.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, not at all. What
you're saying is that the evidence has to be -- the
admissibility of evidence has to be assessed in light
of the circumstances. If your claim of innocence is,
as it may be in this case, that the DNA evidence
doesn't show what you think it shows, fine, that
evidence comes in. If the evidence you're trying to
get in is somebody in the jailhouse said he heard that
somebody else did it, and the -- and you don't
challenge the DNA evidence that places your client
there, then maybe that doesn't create a reasonable
inference, while it might in a different case,
depending on the nature of the prosecution's evidence.
MR. BLUME: I -- first of all, there is no
other State that does it that way. No State considers
that. They look at the third party guilt evidence on
its own terms and consider does it raise a reasonable
inference. And even in your hypothetical, the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm just not
sure that's the case. We're asking about 403. In
order to completely exclude and prescind, in Justice
Scalia's word, that the -- the nature of the
prosecution's case just doesn't seem to me right.
MR. BLUME: 403 --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now -- now, if you want to
say there's a more wooden rule and a -- and a more iron
rule here that was prejudicial, I think that's
something else.
MR. BLUME: There -- there is, and I think
the South Carolina rule is a categorical rule based on
the description. I think it also requires a defendant
to overcome, and it does so in an unfair way. Footnote
in the opinion makes clear that in establishing
whether the third party guilt evidence overcomes the
State's evidence, you look only at the State's
evidence, and the defendant's counter forensic evidence
is deemed irrelevant. So you have to overcome it with
a stacked deck.
JUSTICE ALITO: But is it your argument that
the State's evidence can't be considered at all, or
that it can't be given more than a certain amount of
weight? And if it's the latter, where do you draw the
line?
MR. BLUME: I think that you cannot -- that
as a general matter, a State cannot require a defendant
to persuade a judge of his likely innocence before he
can present evidence to the jury that he's innocent.
That is -- that is putting the judge in the role of the
jury, and that's what the South --
JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but the State doesn't go
that far. If it doesn't require the defendant to
persuade the judge of the defendant's likely innocence,
then there's no constitutional violation. If the -- if
the rule of State law simply requires a consideration
of the strength of the prosecution evidence in relation
to the defense evidence, that's -- that's all right?
MR. BLUME: I think it depends what
consideration means. Consideration, for example, in
terms of is the third party guilt evidence relevant in
some way, that is not constitutionally objectionable.
But when you have a weighing procedure like South
Carolina does and the admissibility of the evidence of
innocence depends on a judge's assessment of the
credibility of the defendant's case and the
prosecution's case, that is what juries do.
JUSTICE ALITO: But where is the line?
That's what I'm trying to get at. If it's -- if the
rule is that the defendant has to raise a reasonable
inference of innocence and you take into account the
strength of a prosecution's case in making that
determination, you don't just accept the defense
evidence and -- and see whether -- how -- how strong an
inference of innocence it would raise if it's believed.
I mean, where is the line?
MR. BLUME: I think that would be -- because
that is implicitly weighed. Your hypothetical to me is
implicitly weighed, and I think that's --
JUSTICE ALITO: And that would be
unconstitutional as well.
MR. BLUME: I think that's unconstitutional.
All these cases where you indicate, well, you
know, what if it's conclusively -- that the evidence is
conclusive and the defendant didn't contest the DNA,
should it be let in --
JUSTICE ALITO: That makes it sound like it
can't be considered at all.
MR. BLUME: That -- well, only for relevance
and possibly for some 403's because that's looking at
the 403 part. But in that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What if the -- what if the
court says, we will weigh it to the extent of
determining whether, in light of the State's case, the
proffered evidence, if accepted, would pass the laugh
test? That's weighing. Is -- is that -- is that
legitimate?
MR. BLUME: I think that that is problematic.
And -- but the -- the point I think is no other State
does it. Now, they would -- if it didn't pass the
laugh test, it wouldn't pass the laugh test on its own
terms. If you read the cases of exclusion, it's where
the defendant wanted to present evidence that some dude
named Duke that nobody can find had a motive to kill
the person. And the courts say, well, no, you can't do
that. Or the -- someone is on trial and they want to
prove that the -- for killing a man's wife, and they
want to show, well, the husband had $1 million in life
insurance policy. And courts said, no, you can't do
that. If all you've got is motive, if all you've got
is propensity, if all you've got is opportunity, that's
not in this -- they're -- in all the other 49 States,
they're looking at it on their own terms. Nothing this
Court will do in Mr. Holmes' case will disturb the law
in the other 49 jurisdictions.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But that does go -- somehow
that goes beyond mere relevance. You can't say that
the -- I don't think you can say that the existence of
the million dollars in life insurance is irrelevant.
It's just that it doesn't prove much unless it can be
combined with certain other kinds of evidence. And
when you say you've got a standard that looks into
that, then you have crossed the line from mere
relevance to probative force, haven't you?
MR. BLUME: Yes, but you're not considering
how strong the government's case is and conditioning
admissibility --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- I grant you that.
But to say that the only test is relevance seems to be
too strong.
MR. BLUME: I'm sorry. I -- I didn't mean to
suggest that. I was sort of just describing how other
States do it and the relevance. Then they also -- many
of them have -- they articulate it different ways, but
it's basically relevance with a 403 type of exclusion,
that if the evidence doesn't meet the third party guilt
evidence on its own terms, doesn't meet a certain
quantum, back -- doesn't get over the laugh test, then
it's not admissible. Other States do it and they say,
well, it's got to create a reasonable inference of
innocence. That's fine. Or it must create a
reasonable likelihood about the defendant's guilt.
That's fine too.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think -- you think
there's no difference where really very questionable
evidence about some third party's guilt is -- is
produced in a case where -- where the State's case
barely makes it over the -- over the line to get to the
jury and you think it's -- it's the same call where
that barely questionable third party evidence is -- is
put in in opposition to a State's case that is -- is
watertight -- I mean, you know, forensic evidence, all
sorts of proof. You -- you think the two have to be
treated the same.
MR. BLUME: Yes, well, I do for the following
reason. The -- that case may make it an easy call, but
it's still the jury's call, just for the same reason
that a judge couldn't, in a very strong case like that,
say, I'm not allowing the defendant's alibi witnesses
to testify.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's the --
that's the problem. That's why this is a special
category of evidence. It's not any evidence. It's
third party guilt evidence because that's evidence that
any defendant could try to introduce in any case. In
any case, the defendant can say somebody else did it
and compile whatever kind of evidence he can get,
whether it's jailhouse informants or -- or whatever,
where the person who did it was often somebody who's
just recently died and -- and is not there to present
an alibi of his own. In every case the defendant can
come up with this evidence, and so you have a special
rule that's designed to deal with that.
And all, it seems to me, that the State court
decision is saying, when you look at the prosecution's
case, is if -- if the prosecution's case makes that an
-- unreasonable under the Gregory test that you agree
with, the reasonable inference, if it's unreasonable to
suggest that somebody else did it, doesn't mean that
you're guilty. You may have all sorts of other claims
that you can make, but you just don't get to present
that type of evidence because of the susceptibility of
prejudice and the susceptibility of fraud and all that
kind of stuff.
MR. BLUME: Well, Chief Justice Roberts, I
submit that that is, one, not correct factually. I
mean, I think if anything, it's more like --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean on -- in
your case.
MR. BLUME: Well, it's not -- it's certainly
not true on the facts of this case. But even as a
general proposition, I think defendants are more likely
to get alibi witnesses to lie for them than other
people. But we still allow the jury, the ultimate lie
detector, to make that decision.
And if you read the hundreds of criminal
appeals that come out each year, this is not a big
problem. It doesn't come up a lot, and the law in the
other jurisdictions seems to handle it. South
Carolina is the State --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the other side agree
with that? I -- I'd be surprised if that were the law
in the other 49 jurisdictions, that the judges just
blind themselves to the -- to the prosecution's case
when they make these calls.
MR. BLUME: I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's your authority for --
for the -- for opposition that every other jurisdiction
does it that way?
MR. BLUME: I think if you go through the
cases, even in the amicus brief, filed by the State of
Kansas, they were able to come up with two decisions:
one, an unreported decision from the D.C. Circuit; and
the other, an intermediate decision by the California
Court of Appeal, which took into account the strength
of the State's case. If you read all the other cases
from all the other States or you read the articulation
of the rules, it doesn't do that. So a judgment in Mr.
Holmes' favor will leave the law of those States
intact.
But even if --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I guess my -- my
point -- maybe it's some of my colleagues' point -- is
that really the strength of the government's case is
subsumed within the general calculus of whether or not
this would cause a delay of -- of time, whether it
would get into extraneous issues, et cetera.
MR. BLUME: Well, it's -- it's not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a way of phrasing it.
MR. BLUME: That's not the way the decisions,
if you read them and read the evidence, that they work.
But it's -- I mean, it -- it does -- if the judge
weighs and conditions the admissibility of evidence of
innocence on the ability to overcome -- and that's the
South Carolina rule, overcome the prosecution's case
and overcome it with a stacked deck where any of the
defendant's counter-evidence is irrelevant, it's
impossible. A defendant could never overcome it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We're not arguing about
that. I -- I don't think anybody has asked you that
question. The question is whether you can consider it
at all, and -- and you say no.
MR. BLUME: Well, you don't have to -- you
can't consider it the way South Carolina is. But I
think it would have the -- the place -- the strength of
the government's case has some bearing. Or the
government's case may have some bearing -- not the
strength of it -- on whether the third party guilt
evidence is relevant to some, you know, issue in the
trial. But it also would have some significance on the
back end if a judge excluded it in determining whether
any error was harmless or not. And that's traditionally
the place on appeal where you consider the strength of
the government's case.
There's no other category of evidence in our
system where we take into account the overall strength
of the case to admit it. If that were true, then why
don't we allow judges to direct verdicts? Why don't we
allow judges to exclude defendant's testimony? Look,
the government's evidence is strong. The DNA evidence
here is overwhelming. Anything this defendant says,
when he gets up there, is going to be a lie. I'm not
allowing it. We don't do that.
Juries in our system make credibility
determinations and that's what the rule, which requires
you to -- where you have to weigh the defendant's
evidence against the government's evidence, usurps the
function of the jury.
Finally, in this case the -- there is a
contention that the error was harmless, and I wanted to
briefly respond to that. Now -- and then if the Court
has no further questions, I will save the remainder of
-- of my time for rebuttal.
But there are three principal reasons the
error in this case was harmless. First -- and part of
this I've already discussed with Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not harmless you
mean.
MR. BLUME: I'm sorry. Was not harmless.
And the first one I've discussed with Justice
Breyer in response to your questions previously, that I
think any fair review of the record here is that the
forensic evidence was a jump ball. Now -- and while we
do not contest that the evidence was sufficient to
convict, it certainly was not overwhelming and a
reasonable juror could have entertained a reasonable
doubt as to Mr. Holmes' guilt based solely on the
evidence at trial.
JUSTICE ALITO: But there wasn't much
evidence against him other than the forensic evidence.
Isn't that right? There's just some people who saw
him nearby.
MR. BLUME: There wasn't even -- yes, there
was some evidence that he was within a mile --
JUSTICE ALITO: Right.
MR. BLUME: -- or so at the time. There was
much stronger evidence that Mr. White was in the area
where the crime occurred, near where the crime
occurred.
JUSTICE ALITO: So the jury must have found
that forensic evidence to be very convincing.
MR. BLUME: Well, they found him guilty based
on it, yes.
But, of course, that can't be the touchstone
of whether the error was prejudicial. The State has
the burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt
that the exclusion of the third party guilt evidence
could not have contributed to the verdict. In this
case, the forensic evidence was, I submit, a jump ball.
The defense had --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you say in --
you cited us to footnote 8 in the court's opinion, and
it says that your claims do not eliminate the fact that
.99 percent of the population, other than your client
and the victim, were excluded as contributors to the
DNA evidence that was found. Do you -- is -- is the
court wrong in saying that?
MR. BLUME: The court is right, to the extent
that it is citing one expert's opinion. It is wrong in
that it ignores that even that agent admitted that the
DNA could have been produced through the contamination
of Officer Mobley, through his -- through the bags. So
that could explain the results.
And it also ignores the fact -- the footnote
does -- that a defense expert, Dr. Peter D'Eustachio
said that that's not a fair and accurate
representation. In my opinion, in my expert opinion,
there -- you cannot do any DNA calculations on this.
These charts are completely unreliable. So that's all
it is, and it's -- it has, I think, no significance
here in light of the evidence as a whole. It's a
factually inaccurate statement of the record as a
whole.
But in addition to the evidence, the most --
a very significant factor in determining whether this
error was harmless or not is having succeeded in
convincing the trial judge to exclude the evidence, the
prosecutor in his closing argument said, look, they've
indicated that this evidence was planted. They've
indicated this evidence was contaminated. If Bobby
Holmes didn't do it, who is -- where is the raping,
murdering thing that did? So he took complete and
unfair advantage of the absence of evidence in the
trial court's ruling in securing the conviction here.
And this Court has said on a number of other occasions,
in Satterwhite and Clemons, that a prosecutor's
argument is an important factor in determining whether
an error was harmless.
And finally --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a question on which
we didn't grant cert.
MR. BLUME: You did not. I mean, we do
believe it was an independent constitutional error, but
even apart from that, it's still a factor in gauging
harmlessness. This Court has said that on a number of
occasions, that what is in the argument is a factor in
harmless error.
And then finally, excluding -- not allowing
the evidence deprived Mr. Holmes of presenting an
alternative counter-theory. You can see a jury saying,
well, you know, we've heard all this. This is a bunch
of contesting evidence, but almost asking the questions
the prosecutor did, which certainly they would have
asked after it was, well, you're right. We didn't hear
any evidence of that. Bobby Holmes had a powerful
counter-story. He should have been allowed to tell it.
The South Carolina rule is unconstitutional.
The judgment should be reversed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Blume.
Mr. Zelenka.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD J. ZELENKA
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ZELENKA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Constitution guarantees criminal
defendants under the Due Process Clause, Compulsory
Process, and Confrontation Clauses a meaningful
opportunity to present a defense. A defendant's right
to present relevant evidence is not unlimited, however,
but is rather subject to reasonable restrictions.
State courts as rulemakers have broad
latitude to establish rules excluding evidence so long
as they are not arbitrary or disproportionate.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Zelenka, do you -- do
you agree with the characterization that your brother
has given, largely by way of quotation from the opinion
in this case, that the rule of admissibility that --
that the -- that the court followed in -- or that the
supreme court approved in this case would have required
the defendant to show to a degree of probability, in
light of all the evidence, including the forensic
evidence, that he was innocent as a condition of -- of
admitting the evidence?
MR. ZELENKA: No, I do not. I think it was
merely an application of the original opinion that
relied upon the straight -- State v. Gregory, that in
fact it must raise a reasonable inference as to the
defendant's innocence.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But, well, what do you -- I
mean, your -- your brother's strongest point is this
statement, and I'm quoting from page 365 of the joint
appendix where the -- where the opinion is set out, at
-- at the top of the page, the second sentence. He
simply cannot overcome the forensic evidence against
him to raise a reasonable inference of his own
innocence. What could that mean other than a
probability that he is innocent in light of all the
evidence, including the forensic evidence?
MR. ZELENKA: I think that -- that language
was basically a review determination as to what exactly
happened. I don't think that the court --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but what does it mean?
I mean, I've given you a suggestion as to what it
seems to mean on a straightforward reading, and -- and
I take it you disagree with that. But can you explain
how it could mean something else?
MR. ZELENKA: No, I don't disagree with the
fact that, in fact, that is what the supreme court said
in its analysis, looking at the particular evidence in
this case, that he was unable to overcome that. But I
think State v. Gregory didn't require that to be the
ultimate threshold that it had to meet, rather that it
raise a reasonable inference as to his innocence.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's -- it's true.
When they -- on the -- on the previous page, the bottom
of 364, they -- they cite -- they first quote Gregory
and then they cite Gay and they characterize, I guess,
the two together as -- well, they say, in Gay, we held
that where there is strong evidence of an appellant's
guilt, especially where there is strong forensic
evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party's
guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the
appellant's own innocence. It doesn't use the word
overcome which it uses on the other page.
MR. ZELENKA: No, it doesn't.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But even without the word
overcome, what -- what can reasonable inference of
innocence mean, considered in light of the other
evidence in the case, if it doesn't mean something like
a probability of -- of innocence?
MR. ZELENKA: It's raising a possibility. I
don't know what level of possibility it is other than a
reasonable inference level, which is a level which --
which means that it's subject to some belief.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But quite apart from that,
it seems to me that the statement is questionable as an
empirical matter. Why is it that forensic evidence
somehow should be used to exclude third party guilt
evidence as -- as a universal proposition? Maybe in
some cases yes, maybe in some -- but this is a
universal proposition.
MR. ZELENKA: It reads certainly like a
universal proposition, but I think it is merely an
application of what happened in State v. Gregory and
State v. Gay when they were presented at that time in
those situations with what they determined to be strong
evidence of forensic guilt --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if I were the trial
court, in a subsequent case in South Carolina, I would
-- I would have to read this instruction of the South
Carolina Supreme Court as saying I simply could not
admit this evidence when there's forensic evidence.
And that's a very strange proposition.
MR. ZELENKA: I would agree that would be a
strange proposition because it suggests that they would
ignore the merits of -- of the proffered evidence
itself. And I don't think that's what happened in this
case, and I don't think that's what the South Carolina
Supreme Court --
JUSTICE BREYER: Your point is that we're
quibbling with the language. Certainly the language
can't be right. I mean, Gregory is quoting America --
Am.Jur. It's totally right. And I don't -- in my
opinion. I don't see how there's a problem. It's
simply a way to prevent the defendant from confusing
the jury with evidence that's not -- doesn't have high
probative value. That's -- so we --
MR. ZELENKA: I think that's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: They don't agree with that
necessarily, but I'm taking that as a premise.
MR. ZELENKA: I think that's --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, he describes this, the
writer of the opinion, and if I hadn't been guilty of
this sin myself, I couldn't criticize others, but he
uses language that's absolute. He says, where there is
strong evidence of an appellant's guilt, especially
where there's strong forensic evidence, the proffered
evidence about a third party's alleged guilt does not
raise a reasonable inference as to the appellant's own
innocence. I took that to mean doesn't tend to show
that the appellant is innocent. And you do have to
have when faced with guilt. It's not relevant if it
doesn't tend to show he's innocent. So that wasn't the
problem.
The problem is that this sentence is wrong.
You could have incredibly strong evidence that this
person is guilty and it could be incredibly strong
evidence that the other person did it.
MR. ZELENKA: Absolutely.
JUSTICE BREYER: And so it should come right
in. So what should have been there is the word
automatically, but the word doesn't automatically show,
but the word isn't there. It doesn't say automatic.
MR. ZELENKA: It doesn't --
JUSTICE BREYER: And he goes on to write as
if it isn't that automatic. And he then favors you
because he says the standards set out in Gregory and
Gay, as if they aren't different.
MR. ZELENKA: That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: But the language says they
are different. So what do we do?
MR. ZELENKA: And I think we also have to
remember that the -- the South Carolina Supreme Court
was viewing this simply as a matter of State common
law. They weren't looking at it as a matter of Federal
constitutional law.
JUSTICE BREYER: And so what do we do? We
get the -- we read the opinion literally, and moreover,
that's why I asked it. If you look into the evidence,
it looks -- you know, maybe it's closer than you might
think. And if we start looking at the evidence of
every case in the United States, it's going to be a
problem for everybody. But -- but -- so what do we do?
That's my question.
MR. ZELENKA: I -- I think we can look at a
much narrower approach that also evolves out of this
particular judgment as determined by the trial court.
There was essentially a -- a lack of persuasive
assurances of trustworthiness in the statements that
were, in fact, given. They lacked corroboration, the
particular statements that were alleged to have been
given by Jimmy McCaw White, in ways similar to
situations where evidence should not be deemed
relevantly admissible because of that lack of
reliability and trustworthiness.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not what the court
said, though. The court didn't -- did -- whatever the
court said, it clearly did not say just looking at the
third party guilt evidence by itself, it's not -- it's
not trustworthy. Whatever else it said, it didn't say
that.
MR. ZELENKA: No, it didn't say that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Yes. Now, you say
that's true. Now, it may well have been true, but that
-- we're -- we're --
MR. ZELENKA: The trial judge said that. The
trial judge said it lacked the type of corroboration.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the trial judge also
kept it out, didn't he, because he believed there was
-- there was no penal interest exception to the hearsay
rule?
MR. ZELENKA: He was -- he -- he did that
also, but ultimately he blended both concepts together
and said both as a matter of substantive law and as a
matter of evidentiary law in the -- the final
conclusion at the end of the State's case, when he made
the ultimate determination --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but then you get to
the --
MR. ZELENKA: -- that it would be
inadmissible.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry. Then you get to
the -- the South Carolina Supreme Court, and they don't
keep it out on -- on grounds of -- of threshold
reliability.
MR. ZELENKA: They didn't specifically
address that. They went to their ultimate
determination viewing the evidence.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And as I recall, the trial
court did say that this was pretty persuasive evidence
but for the fact that you had to exclude some of it
because that there was no exception to the hearsay
rule. Didn't he say that?
MR. ZELENKA: It -- they said that the
evidence existed, that the statements --
JUSTICE SCALIA: He said more than that. I
think he said it was --
MR. ZELENKA: -- there was some evidence --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --
MR. ZELENKA: -- that allowed for --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Your friend will tell us
what he said.
MR. ZELENKA: -- that allowed for a jury to
make the determination. That information was there.
But also, it's -- the judge found that there wasn't
other evidence other than the statement that clearly
pointed to the defendant -- excuse me -- that clearly
pointed -- pointed to Jimmy McCaw White --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this
question?
MR. ZELENKA: -- as being guilty of the
crime.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing -- I've written a
fair number of opinions involving criminal cases where
I've had to say that we take all the inferences
favorable to the prosecution, and based on that rule,
we find there's sufficient evidence to justify the
jury's verdict. How we would have decided it is not
before us. We accept the jury's verdict.
What if the -- on the merits of the
underlying crimes, the South Carolina Supreme Court had
written that kind of an opinion rather than there's
overwhelming evidence of guilt? Do you think they
would have held the third party evidence admissible or
inadmissible?
MR. ZELENKA: I think they would have still
held the third party evidence inadmissible because of
the lack of corroboration. It lacked that requirement
of reliability to get over --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it's odd that they
didn't say that. Their -- the reasons they gave were
that the evidence of guilt was overwhelming.
MR. ZELENKA: And they gave that immediately
after they had issued their prior opinion in -- in
State v. Gay where they looked at a case where, again,
they found overwhelming forensic evidence of guilt as
defeating the probative value of the defendant's
presentation. And trial counsel --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Zelenka, do you agree
that all 49 other States do not look at the -- at the
weight of the prosecution's case when making this
decision?
MR. ZELENKA: No, I -- I do not agree with
that. And -- and we've cited in our brief Kansas v.
Adams. We -- we do not analyze those cases to make a
determination as to what the trial judges and the other
State courts did not look at. We think it's implicit,
in fact, in most situations, that you have to consider
to some extent the State's evidence to determine the
reliability of the nature of the third party guilt
evidence which comes in. You have to have --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you use --
MR. ZELENKA: -- some understanding of that
evidence.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could -- could you use the
same rule with respect to alibi evidence? The trial
judge would say this evidence for the prosecution is so
strong, I'm not going to let any alibi evidence in. Is
there -- is there anything special about third party
guilt? Couldn't -- couldn't you use -- use it for
other defenses?
MR. ZELENKA: I think there is something
special about third party guilt. Alibi is merely the
defendant saying I didn't do it and I wasn't there when
the crime was done. I think in third party guilt
evidence you're diverting the case off in another
direction that requires some special attention by the
courts, and I think most States recognize it requires
special attention by the court because it's hitting on
a collateral issue requiring the State to prove or, to
some extent, disprove that another individual did it,
an individual that might not be subject to notice
requirements, an individual that might not even be
alive. We look at -- you can look at the -- this
Court's decision in Donnelly v. the United States, a
11 decision, that recognized there's something
different about third party guilt potential evidence
because of the inherent unreliability which may exist
in the manner and the way it was presented.
JUSTICE ALITO: Can -- can a trial judge
exclude defense evidence based on credibility
determinations?
MR. ZELENKA: No. I don't -- I don't think
they can.
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that -- but isn't that
what happened here?
MR. ZELENKA: No. I think -- I think this
court excluded it on the basis of reliability
determinations, whether in fact there was sufficient
corroboration for what the individual was saying in the
statement. The trial judge found that the information
that was purported to be said by Jimmy McCaw White was
something that was generally known within the community
as a whole.
JUSTICE ALITO: How could -- how could court
conclude that the State's evidence was strong without
--
making -- without finding, in effect, that the State's
forensic witnesses were credible?
MR. ZELENKA: I think they could evaluate the
evidence in the manner that it -- that it was presented
to them to get an indicia as to whether there is any
reasonable reliability to the third party guilt
evidence.
JUSTICE ALITO: Just take, for example, the
-- the palm print. The chief Mobley said he found it
in -- in the apartment, and that would be very strong
evidence, if in fact that was the case. But his
credibility was contested. So how can you conclude
that the palm print is strong evidence for the
prosecution without implicitly making a determination,
a credibility determination?
MR. ZELENKA: Well, I think that type of
evaluation, we believe, necessarily needs to be done to
make a determination to the -- to the probative value
or the prejudicial value to the presentation of the
third party guilt evidence of -- of the defendant, that
all those matters need to be looked at as to whether,
in fact, it should come in.
JUSTICE ALITO: But then the court is making
MR. ZELENKA: If there was just the palm
print --
JUSTICE ALITO: -- the court is excluding
defense evidence based on a finding that a prosecution
witness is credible.
MR. ZELENKA: No. I don't think that's the
test, and I don't think that's what they were doing in
this case. They were making that -- viewing that
information to determine whether the presentation was
reliable that was being presented, whether there was
some substance actually to what was being given, and
whether leaving that information out would have
deprived him of a meaningful right to present relevant
evidence in his defense.
JUSTICE ALITO: On the other side, if
Westbrook was credible, isn't that strong evidence for
the defense?
MR. ZELENKA: The -- the -- it's -- it's
evidence for the defense, but it's evidence for the
defense that lacked the sense of reliability. And it
lacked --
JUSTICE ALITO: But if he's credible that
White confessed to him --
MR. ZELENKA: He -- he --
JUSTICE ALITO: -- then wouldn't that be
strong evidence for the defense?
MR. ZELENKA: It's some evidence for the
defense, but the problem is it lacked corroboration.
It wasn't given in a timely manner. If you contrast
that to the situation which occurred in Chambers v.
Mississippi, there was an entire information that the
Chambers situation had independent of the third party
statement which supported and showed that that
information did have persuasive assurances of
reliability. That was lacking in this particular case.
I see my time is about up, but I would --
JUSTICE THOMAS: Counsel, before you change
subjects, isn't it more accurate that the trial court
actually found that the evidence met the Gregory
standard?
MR. ZELENKA: No. He specifically found, I
believe, from my reading --
JUSTICE THOMAS: Well, he says --
MR. ZELENKA: -- that it didn't meet the
Gregory standard.
JUSTICE THOMAS: Well, he says at first
blush, the above arguably rises to the Gregory
standard. However, the engine that drives the train in
this Gregory analysis is the confession by Jimmy McCaw
White. And then he goes on to say that that, of
course, can't be introduced because it's hearsay. So
it -- it seems as though he says that if it is to be
believed what Jimmy White says, it meets the Gregory
standard.
So I don't quite understand where Gay, which
is subsequent to -- to this case -- where Gay comes in
because it didn't seem to be the standard that the
trial court applied.
MR. ZELENKA: Actually Gay was -- two things.
Gay was not the standard when the trial judge made the
pretrial hearing. Gay was -- was the standard at the
time the case was tried, and the trial judge was
addressing that standard and he found that Gay was not
satisfied because he didn't believe that there was
evidence which clearly pointed to the defendant --
excuse me -- to the third party as being guilty of the
particular crime. He made that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excluding the confession.
Excluding the confession.
MR. ZELENKA: Other than that information in
the confession, which he had also found previously
lacked appropriate corroboration at the trial --
pretrial hearing as evidenced within his written order.
I would also like to preserve the ability to
argue harmless error, as we've done in our case to some
extent. The South Carolina Supreme Court's opinion was
a harmless error analysis, but more importantly, in
addition, that -- that we do not believe and continue
to assert that the matter wasn't properly preserved
before this Court based upon the manner and only the
manner that it was raised before the South Carolina
Supreme Court in the direct appeal briefs.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Zelenka.
Mr. Johnson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEFFEN N. JOHNSON
ON BEHALF OF KANSAS, ET AL.,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
In my time today, I'd like to focus on two
basic issues.
The first is that this case does not approach
the outer limit of due process set by this Court in
Chambers. As the trial court found in three specific
instances, there is no evidence to corroborate these
confessions. And the confession evidence itself in
Chambers was far stronger than the confession evidence
in this case.
Second, I'd like to respond to Justice
Breyer's question about the nature of the Supreme Court
of Carolina's opinion and to remind the Court that it's
reviewing the judgment primarily, not the opinion. And
it seems to me that Petitioner's argument is
essentially criticizing the opinion for the absence of
a word, the absence of the word automatically, and that
the opinion would look very different if it said where
there's strong evidence of guilt, the defendant's third
party guilt evidence doesn't automatically raise a
reasonable inference of innocence.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. And I -- I take it
what you will do, in the course of your second point,
is tell us the answer to this question, that if we do
not accept the overcome by reasonable inference
formulation that is here, what would be an acceptable
formulation because I think that's what you -- you say
you're getting to. But that would be very helpful to
MR. JOHNSON: We -- we believe that the raise
a reasonable inference of innocence standard, as the
counsel for South Carolina said, does not necessarily
require that it be the only inference --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, one of the problems is
I don't know what it requires. On -- on the -- on the
second page of the opinion that I quoted, it is used
with the word overcome, which certainly suggests that
it is supposed to raise a probability of innocence in
light of all the evidence. Sometimes it is used
without overcome, as it was earlier in the opinion. I
don't know what they mean by inference. Do they mean
evidence from which one might reasonably conclude, from
which one -- there is a reasonable possibility of
concluding? I just don't know what the terms mean. So
I hope you'll give us a suggested formulation with --
with terms that -- that are defined that -- that you
and the States that you represent would -- would think
was an acceptable and constitutional standard.
MR. JOHNSON: And I think your formulation is
actually a fair one. Does it raise some --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I included several.
Which -- which one --
MR. JOHNSON: The second one, does it raise
some reasonable possibility of innocence. In other
words, if you believe this evidence --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. JOHNSON: -- does it raise a reasonable
possibility of innocence, not -- not that it's the most
likely or the only possibility from that evidence.
And I think if you look at the South Carolina
Supreme Court's opinion carefully, in light of the --
the supreme court's decisions in Gregory and Gay, you
see that in fact what the court was doing was simply
saying this case is like Gay. There's strong evidence.
We're going to look at the evidence on both sides.
And there's a -- there is certainly language in the
opinion that makes it sound like an automatic or
categorical rule, but in fact, they did go on to look
at the defendant's evidence.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Has anybody else looked at
the evidence on both sides?
MR. JOHNSON: The trial court certainly
looked at the defendant's evidence.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Other States I mean. Other
States.
MR. JOHNSON: Yes, Your Honor. I think that
it would be fair to say that -- that any of the nine
States collected in our appendix whose standard is does
the evidence raise a reasonable inference of innocence
look at those sorts of questions.
In addition, we collected, I believe, four
cases in our brief, in addition to the California Court
of Appeal and the D.C. Circuit's opinion in Cabrera.
There's the Kansas v. Adams case which very clearly
looks at the State evidence. In that case, the issue
was the defendant was on trial for shaking his baby to
death, and the medical evidence of the prosecution
showed that the death took place within a certain time
period. The defendant wanted to introduce evidence
that his wife --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we -- can we just back
up to Cabrera? The D.C. Circuit did not publish that
and --
MR. JOHNSON: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and unless the rule has
changed, it didn't have -- it didn't have any
precedential effect -- those opinions that they did not
put in the Federal Reports.
MR. JOHNSON: I think its reasoning stands on
its own, Your Honor. But in addition to that case, you
have these other three published cases, and we stand by
the description of them in our argument.
Kansas v. Adams was a case where the court
said the issue -- the State's evidence shows this baby
died within a certain time period, and although the
wife had a history of violence against the child, the
court said it's not getting in because it's -- there's
no evidence that she had access to the child during the
relevant time period. That's a very clear example.
There are other examples.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there had been
evidence that the time of death testimony had been
contrived, planted, fabricated. Then what? Or suppose
that was the allegation of the defense.
MR. JOHNSON: I -- I think it would be within
the -- the trial court's discretion to exclude it. I
certainly don't think it would necessarily violate the
due process --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But if he did, he would be
making a credibility determination, wouldn't he? He
would be deciding an issue that normally would be
submitted to the jury.
MR. JOHNSON: It's not our position, Your
Honor, that -- that the trial court can make
credibility determinations, but --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the example that
Justice Kennedy gave you was such a determination.
MR. JOHNSON: I -- I think, though -- I -- I
suppose that would depend on the nature of the specific
evidence at issue. If you look at the evidence --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wasn't it in the baby-
shaking case?
MR. JOHNSON: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why was there no credibility
determination made in the baby-shaking case you just
described? Didn't -- didn't you have to conclude that
the evidence concerning the time of death was -- was
credible, was accurate?
MR. JOHNSON: I -- I think, Your Honor, that
the trial judge found that -- that there simply wasn't
a dispute about that, that -- that the -- that there
wasn't enough. And so it was fine to look at the
State's case. And I would urge the Court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there is a dispute here
as to the forensic evidence. The suggestion is it's
planted.
MR. JOHNSON: That's correct, Your Honor, and
-- and we would -- we would simply urge the Court not
to adopt a categorical rule that it's inappropriate to
look at the State's case.
JUSTICE BREYER: What do I do in this case?
I'm totally with you if I read American Jurisprudence
and others as saying the following. Judge, there's a
particular kind of evidence that really has a tendency
to mislead the jury, that's that somebody else did it
because they start trying the other person in their
minds. So if you have a strong case that this guy did
it, don't let them even introduce that evidence unless
you have some reason to think it's really going to show
this guy didn't do it. That's what it's saying, isn't
MR. JOHNSON: Yes, and -- and --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, that gets us
through Gregory. And the difficulty here is that the
court went on to say something that couldn't possibly
be true, which is if you have a strong case against
this guy, never admit this other thing. That couldn't
be right.
MR. JOHNSON: And that's why --
JUSTICE BREYER: And so now what do I do with
that particularly? Because the other side has said, by
the way, this is that case.
MR. JOHNSON: And that's why I would
emphasize the trial court's findings in this case.
JUSTICE BREYER: The trial court's findings
-- I read them the way Justice Thomas did.
MR. JOHNSON: It's very clear. This is at
pages 136 and 137 of the joint appendix, page 140 of
the joint appendix, and again at pages 252 and 253 of
the joint appendix. The trial court said there is
nothing to corroborate these confessions.
Now, contrast Chambers --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: On that, could a
prosecutor have gotten this case -- gotten an
indictment against White on the basis that he had four
witnesses who put him in the proximity of the crime,
four who said that they heard him confess? On the
basis of that evidence, could White have been indicted
for this?
MR. JOHNSON: Possibly --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and also throw in
one more thing, the victim's description of the
assailant. So if -- if White could have been indicted
for this crime and -- and yet the jury is not allowed
to hear that evidence, that sounds passing strange to
MR. JOHNSON: Possibly that evidence would be
sufficient to support an indictment, Your Honor, but I
don't believe it would be sufficient to support a
conviction.
And I also think that it's -- it's -- we're
talking about the outer limits of due process here. If
you look at the evidence in Chambers, the corroboration
evidence there was extensive. There was a witness who
said I saw the third party shoot the victim.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Surely, you're not arguing
the third party evidence can only come in if it's proof
beyond a reasonable doubt. You're not arguing that
standard, are you?
MR. JOHNSON: No. No.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But you did say it wouldn't
be enough to convict.
MR. JOHNSON: Right, Your Honor, and -- and
that -- that might present a different case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't --
MR. JOHNSON: But -- but that evidence --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said it was enough to
indict and that very same evidence is put before the
jury, but it wouldn't be enough to convict?
MR. JOHNSON: I'm saying, Your Honor, that
the evidence here clearly isn't strong enough to meet
the standard for due process, quite apart from whether
it's enough to support an indictment or a conviction.
And if you compare it with the evidence in Chambers,
that's very clear where there was eyewitness testimony
of the shooting itself. There was eyewitness testimony
that the third party was at the scene of the crime with
the gun in his hand. There was -- there was testimony
from the gun dealer that he sold the person the type of
crime at issue -- the type of gun at issue both before
and after the offense. The confession itself, in
contrast to the evidence here, was a sworn statement.
There was not even any dispute as to whether the -- the
confession was made. The only dispute was whether the
evidence of the confession was true.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Johnson, your -- your
citation of the -- of the portion of the -- of the
trial court opinion, which says that there was no
corroboration of the -- of the confession, that was not
stated in -- to say, and therefore, the confessions
were weak evidence. That point was made in order to
say, therefore, the confession cannot be admitted
because the -- the rule was it's hearsay, but hearsay
that's corroborated can be admitted. So I think you're
misdescribing the --
MR. JOHNSON: No, I -- if I may answer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please.
MR. JOHNSON: I understand that, Your Honor.
It was part of the hearsay analysis, but it's a
narrower ground that's -- that's fully supportable by
the record for affirmance because it distinguishes the
evidence in Chambers.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Johnson.
Mr. Blume, you have 2 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BLUME: May it please the Court:
The trial judge in this case found, if you
want to go -- he found there was sufficient evidence
from which the jury could find that Jimmy White was in
the area at the time. The trial judge -- that's on
joint appendix page 134.
On 135, he also found there was sufficient
evidence from which a jury could believe that Jimmy
White confessed to being the perpetrator, and there was
sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude
that Jimmy White had in the past committed acts against
women.
And then he made the mistake of fact and a
mistake of law. He treated White as unavailable and
therefore he excluded the statement made. That was
wrong. White was available. Under South Carolina law,
he should have been able to have been called. He could
have been impeached, and the prior -- these statements
would come in as substantive evidence.
It was also wrong, even as the statement gets
penal interest. The only corroboration is was the
statement made, not is it true. That's the -- and in
that case, he found the statements were made. And
that's why the State supreme court did not embrace or
rely upon what the trial court did because it was
clearly wrong.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does your -- your
case hinge upon your challenge to the DNA evidence? In
other words, if you don't have the suggestion that the
DNA evidence was manipulated, would you agree that in
that case the third party guilt evidence could be kept
out?
MR. BLUME: No. I -- I think it might be
harmless at that point. Any error excluding might be
harmless. But the third party guilt evidence
inferentially and directly says, you know, this DNA
isn't all it's cracked up to be.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why would it be
-- I mean, if it meets the standard for harmless, it
suggests that it didn't make a difference, would not
have been likely to make a difference with the jury,
and therefore it could have been excluded in the first
instance.
MR. BLUME: No. I just think it might be
that it was then -- the error might not have been
prejudicial in context of the record as a whole.
But a jury could still, looking at the third party
guilt evidence say, well, you know, this DNA isn't all
it's cracked up to be. There's nothing sacrosanct
about DNA or forensic evidence.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that
exactly what the rule is designed to prevent? In other
words, you have no challenge to the DNA evidence, and
yet you bring up some third party guilt evidence. And
your suggestion just now is, well, the jury might think
maybe there's not that much to the DNA evidence.
MR. BLUME: Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, it
gets them off on a detour, distracts their attention
from the evidence that is before them.
MR. BLUME: And the jury might be absolutely
right about that, and it's their determination to make.
It might be that they don't challenge the DNA evidence
because the trial judge didn't give them funds to do
it. In this case they did it because a Washington,
D.C. law firm essentially was able to provide funds for
them to really look at and challenge the inadequacies
in this evidence.
It's that -- the problem is that even if you
don't read the opinion like we do -- and we think it's
the only fair reading -- there's no question that the
South Carolina rule requires you to overcome it and it
stacks the deck.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
