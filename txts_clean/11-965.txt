(10:02 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 11-965, Daimler AG v. Bauman.
Mr. Dupree.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DUPREE, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DUPREE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit held that Daimler, a
foreign corporation, is subject to general jurisdiction
in California and thus may be sued in California on any
claim arising anywhere in the world.  The Ninth Circuit
reached this conclusion by attributing to Daimler the
California contacts of a Daimler subsidiary, Mercedes
Benz USA, a separate corporation that respects all
corporate formalities and that is not Daimler's alter
ego.
The Ninth Circuit's approach violates due
process.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do we have to reach that
question?  I mean, I guess the Ninth Circuit must have
been interpreting the long-arm statute of California,
right?
MR. DUPREE:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, are there -- were
there California cases that disregarded the -- the
corporate form?
MR. DUPREE:  California respects the
corporate form.  The Ninth Circuit applied what appears
to be a Federal common law of agency that the Ninth
Circuit admittedly developed solely for purposes of the
jurisdictional inquiry.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the jurisdictional
inquiry is conducted on the basis of the California
statute, isn't it?
MR. DUPREE:  It is, but at the same time,
the California statute extends to the limit of due
process.  And so what the Ninth Circuit did was it
construed what the permissible outer bounds of the due
process clause was in this context.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see.  It's -- it's
California's reference to the outer bounds of
jurisdiction that causes -- causes this to be a
constitutional case?
MR. DUPREE:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's nothing in
the Constitution, is there, that would prohibit a State
from adopting a rule that a parent is responsible for
any acts of a wholly-owned subsidiary?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there
may be a constitutional limit; certainly, to the extent
that, say, California adopted a rule that said, for
purposes of some sort of liability, we are going to
disregard the corporate form, I think that could pose
due process concerns to the extent that it is purporting
to override, say, the corporate law of Delaware.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, even on a
prospective basis, your brief talks about notice and
fairness and predictability; but if California said,
going forward, this is the rule that we're going to
apply, is there any constitutional problem with that?
MR. DUPREE:  I -- I still think there would
be, Mr. Chief Justice.  In other words, I take Your
Honor's point about fair notice, if California said,
going forward, this is the rule we're going to apply.
But at the same time, I'm not quite sure
what in the Constitution would empower, say, California
to essentially override, say, Delaware's corporate law
and say, for our State purposes, we're essentially going
to rewrite the corporate DNA of a corporation that's
chartered in Delaware in order to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We permitted that in
Container Corp.
MR. DUPREE:  I beg your pardon, Your Honor?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We permitted that in
Container Corp.  We permitted California law to tax the
parent California corporation for the earnings of all
its foreign subsidiaries.  And we said the due process
clause wasn't offended by that.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, Justice Sotomayor,
typically, this Court has applied a less rigorous due
process standard in the tax cases than it has in the
personal jurisdiction cases.
If one were to look at, say, Goodyear or
McIntyre, of any of this Court's more recent
jurisdictional decisions, it typically takes a much more
rigorous view of the due process clause's limits on a
sovereign's ability to adjudicate matters that arise
outside the forum than it has in the tax context.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We would never get to
this question if you hadn't conceded that there is
general jurisdiction over the U.S. subsidiary, over --
what is it -- MBUSA.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I
respectfully disagree that we conceded the point below.
I'm not sure, frankly, that we could concede something
like that on behalf of a different corporation that's
not a party to this lawsuit.
But it is true that we focused on the
attribution question in the Ninth Circuit.  And at the
end of the day, I don't think that that point affects
the outcome in this case because --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if there were nothing
to attribute, then that would be the end of it.  If
there was -- if there was not general jurisdiction over
MBUSA, that would be the end of the case, wouldn't it?
MR. DUPREE:  Yes, it would.  That would be
one way to resolve the case.  Another way to resolve the
case --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you didn't -- we
can't resolve it that way since you -- you didn't
challenge the general jurisdiction over the subsidiary.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, again, we did not argue
that point.  Instead, we focused on the attribution
issue, but at the same time --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Dupree -- I'm sorry.
Please.
MR. DUPREE:  I was going to say, Your Honor,
at the same time, I do think that that notion, that
MBUSA was subject to general jurisdiction in California,
was necessarily part of the Ninth Circuit's holding.  So
I do think it is properly preserved for this Court's
review, if the Court elected to resolve this case on
that ground.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, Mr. Dupree, even if you
waived that point, if I understand it correctly, you did
not waive the point that, even with all attribution in
the world, there still is no general jurisdiction over
Daimler.  In other words, you could attribute all
MBUSA's contacts, and you still would not have general
jurisdiction over Daimler; is that right?
MR. DUPREE:  Justice Kagan, that is exactly
right.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So in that sense, it really
doesn't depend on the attribution standard, all these
hard questions of is it an alter ego test or is it an
agency test and how does the Constitution relate to
State law because we could apply any test we wanted and
there still wouldn't be general jurisdiction over
Daimler in California.
MR. DUPREE:  Justice Kagan, that certainly
would be an acceptable route for this Court to resolve
the case.  And Your Honor has it exactly right, in that,
even if one were to attribute the constitutional
contacts of MBUSA to Daimler, you would still be left
with a joint enterprise that, plainly, is not at home in
the State of California.
It would still be a German corporation,
headquartered in Stuttgart, that draws only
approximately 2 percent of its overall vehicle revenue
from California sales, so, yes --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that a reasonable --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do foreign -- foreign
countries resolve this attribution question?  Would --
would we be standing alone, or are there a lot of other
countries that assert jurisdiction over the parent, if
there is general jurisdiction over the sub?
MR. DUPREE:  By and large, Justice Scalia,
most other countries respect the corporate form and
that includes parent/subsidiary relations.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  "By and large"?  Who -- who
are the small?
MR. DUPREE:  I'm not aware of anyone who
disrespects it; and, in fact, our amici talk at length
about how California's exercise of general jurisdiction
in this case would not be appropriate in virtually any
other nation.  I'm, frankly, not sure where what the
Ninth Circuit did here would be viewed as tolerable.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So how do we deal with
that?  That's what's -- I mean, it's in your interest to
argue that -- tell me how to deal with this.
It's perhaps true -- I think it's true that
a State doesn't have to allow companies to have
wholly-owned corporations.  Under the Constitution of
the United States, nothing says they do.  Or a State
could say, wholly-owned corporations?  Well, there's no
limited liability.  Or they could say, in certain kinds
of accidents, there's n o limited -- et cetera.  You see,
they have lots of choice.
So what really seems to have been going on
here is the Ninth Circuit, from your perspective, just
really misstated California law by out to lunch.  When
they say we want it to be as broad as the
Constitution, they don't mean, because we could get rid
of limited liability, that that's what we do.
So -- so how can we deal with a circuit
court that seems to seriously misstate the law of a
State?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, I think the way this
Court should deal with the Ninth Circuit in this case is
simply to reverse it, Your Honor.  I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand that that's
what you would like as the bottom line.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  I would like to know the
chain of reasoning that gets --
(Laughter.)
MR. DUPREE:  The chain of reasoning, Your
Honor, is simply that California, like all States,
generally respects the corporate form, certainly with
regard to liability determinations.
In fact, this is a point that Professor
Brilmayer makes at length in her amicus brief, where she
says that it is anomalous for a State, on one hand, to
respect the corporate form as to liability
determinations, but then, when it comes to making these
sorts of personal jurisdictional determinations, it
applies a completely different standard.
So I think --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But suppose -- but
suppose we had a case of an accident on a California
highway injuring California people and they sued,
charging that the Mercedes Benz was defectively
manufactured.
Would there be jurisdiction over both the
parent and the sub in that situation?
MR. DUPREE:  If it were the case Your Honor
hypothesized, I think there may well be specific
jurisdiction available, depending on whether Daimler
purposefully availed itself of the California forum.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what does that mean?
I mean, it certainly wanted to have its cars sold in --
in California.
MR. DUPREE:  Right.  What this Court has
said in its opinions in Asahi and then, of course, in
McEntyre, is that you look whether the corporation
targeted the forum.  And in Asahi, Justice O'Connor's
opinion identified several facts that could support such
a finding.
For example, whether the parent targeted
advertising at the forum, whether the parent designed a
product specifically for use in that forum.  And, of
course, this Court has said, repeatedly, that questions
of specific jurisdiction are highly fact dependent.
And so, in Your Honor's hypothetical, I
think what the plaintiffs would do to establish specific
jurisdiction over the foreign parent would be precisely
to attempt to amass evidence showing that Daimler
targeted the forum where they intend to bring the suit.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, there was injury in
the forum, and it was caused by defective manufacturing
abroad.  That's a typical basis for jurisdiction under
long-arm statutes.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, certainly, courts have
exercised specific jurisdiction in that situation.  But,
of course, as this Court's ruling in McEntyre
illustrates, that's not necessarily always the case, and
there may, of course, be situations where a product does
cause injury in the forum, yet the foreign parent is not
necessarily subject to specific jurisdiction in that
forum.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, how -- how would you
answer Justice Ginsburg's question if you were writing
the opinion in your favor?  Would you say that, in the
hypothetical, Daimler Chrysler put in motion a course of
events that caused an injury in California?  Is that the
way our jurisprudence works?
MR. DUPREE:  Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you're going to answer
the hypothetical in an opinion, how would you -- what
would you say?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, I think I would go back
to what this Court has articulated, first of all, is the
standard for specific jurisdiction, which is purposeful
availment or purposeful direction.  I think as far as
what constellation of facts --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, Daimler has
purposely availed itself of California jurisdiction by
establishing the sub that -- that operates there by
establishing Mercedes U.S., that it operates there.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, Mercedes --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so creating a
subsidiary is not availing itself of jurisdiction?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I think,
in some cases, a subsidiary's work could give rise to
specific jurisdiction, but I think that's not
necessarily true across the United States in all cases.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I agree.  And I'm asking
what is the rationale that you would use to answer
Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical in the -- in the opinion
for the Court that is ruling in your favor?
MR. DUPREE:  The answer I would give is
that, in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, the foreign
parent could be subject to specific jurisdiction if it
purposefully availed itself of the forum, and that very
well could be an inquiry that turns on the subsidiary's
activity.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And my question is whether
or not by creating Mercedes U.S., Daimler didn't
purposely avail itself of the forum?
MR. DUPREE:  I don't think it did,
Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because?
MR. DUPREE:  Because I don't think there is
any evidence in this record that suggests that, by
creating a subsidiary that does business generally, it
was purposefully targeting California.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Dupree --
JUSTICE ALITO:  If we agree with you -- if
we agree with you that the test should be whether the
subsidiary is an alter ego of the parent, would that
depend on the -- the law of the particular State in
which the suit is brought?  Or would it be based on some
general understanding of alter ego liability?
MR. DUPREE:  Justice Alito, I think the best
test would be to look to State law for guidance,
precisely because that is the law that commercial actors
throughout our country typically would look to, to
determine whether or not they might be in a
veil-piercing situation.
JUSTICE ALITO:  That would mean that due
process would mean something different potentially in
California and New York, for example.  Wouldn't that be
rather strange?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, I'm not sure, Your Honor.
Certainly this Court, in other due process contexts, has
looked to the substance of State law to inform its
judgements, for example, in determining the scope of
protected property interests.  In punitive damages
cases, it's looked to State law to determine the
constitutional boundaries.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where else have we done
it in the personal jurisdiction context, define the
limits of the due process -- Federal due process, in
accordance with State law?
MR. DUPREE:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Didn't we create tests
in International Shoe, in Burger King, separate from
State law?
MR. DUPREE:  The test this Court created in
International Shoe, I think, is probably best
characterized as a Federal common law test.  I think
that this situation is not quite analogous, precisely
for the reason I mentioned in my answer to
Justice Alito, is that commercial actors and lawyers and
parties throughout the country typically look to State
law for guidance.
And if this Court were to adopt a general
Federal common law standard, under which I think we
would still prevail, but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do we do with
all the amici briefs that points to countless articles
that talk about the corporate veil-piercing as the most
arbitrary of State laws out there?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, I'm not sure --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know how -- how
corporations get any sense of comfort from a law that's
so irrationally applied, according to some.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, I think some of the
amici, candidly, may overstate the purported confusion.
At the end of the day, veil-piercing law is certainly
well settled and vetted in this country's legal
traditions, and I think it is sufficiently capable of
precise application in advance.  Corporations deal with
that standard on a day-to-day basis.
And so, although I take Your Honor's point
that, at the margins, there may be room for debate as to
whether a veil should be pierced in a particular case, I
think, by and large, it's a general standard, it's a
familiar standard, and it's a workable standard, and
it's a standard that people look to on a day-to-day
basis.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, I've been looking
for the text of the California jurisdiction statute.
Where is it?  I mean -- you know, that's what this case
is all about, isn't it?
MR. DUPREE:  I believe it's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it in your brief?  Is it
in the Respondent's brief?  Is it in the Government's
brief?  I can't find the darn thing.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, we'll provide the cite to
Your Honor.  It's a --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't want the cite.  I
want the text in front of me, right here.
MR. DUPREE:  I will --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what briefs are
supposed to have --
MR. DUPREE:  Right.  I will --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- all -- all of the
significant statutes that -- that relate to the case.
MR. DUPREE:  Right.  I will provide the cite
to Your Honor on rebuttal.  It is the California Civil
Code --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't have the California
Civil Code -- you're saying it's -- it's not in the
briefing?
MR. DUPREE:  It is in the briefing.  We did
not reproduce it as a separate addendum at the
beginning, but I believe it is quoted in the briefing,
and I will provide Your Honor with a precise page cite
on rebuttal.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it does -- it does
provide for the exercise of jurisdiction to the limits
of due process.
MR. DUPREE:  That's exactly right, Justice
Ginsburg.  It simply says that California may exercise
long-arm jurisdiction, consistent and to the limit
permitted by Federal due process.
That's all the statute says, Justice Scalia.
I'll reserve the remainder of my time for
rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Kneedler.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
As several questions from the Court suggest,
the Due Process Clause itself does not supply fixed
rules for the attribution of forum contacts from one
corporation to another.  Rather, such rules are the
province of the positive law that creates the
corporation and other substantive law, such as agency,
that defines the relationship of that juridical person
to other persons.
And those rules are the ones that the
corporations themselves rely upon and that others who
deal with the corporations rely upon.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me why we
just don't rely on the tests we apply in the tax cases?
It's a Federal test, and it says, if you're functionally
and economically tied together and you control the other
entity -- the parent controls the subsidiary, your
earnings are subject to the Due Process Clause and can
be taxed by an individual State.  It seems like a fairly
simple test.
And if you break down the complicated
California test, really, that was the essence it was
getting to.  So why do we go to the vagrancies of State
law, and why don't we just do the true and tried?
MR. KNEEDLER:  But in the instance you're
talking about, in taxation -- and this is related to a
question the Chief Justice asked -- the Due Process
Clause does not, itself, prohibit a State or the Federal
government from attributing substantive liability, for
example, from a -- from a subsidiary to a parent or, in
the case of taxation, of choosing to look at the entire
enterprise of which the parent corporation is the head.
But those are the results of deliberate
choices by the lawmaking organs of the State, which --
State legislature, or when Congress does it, the Federal
government.  They do not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  California --
MR. KNEEDLER:  -- reflect a general
determination that in all circumstances, the acts of the
agent or the acts of a subsidiary should be attributed
to the parent.  In fact, the general rule is quite to
the contrary.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in the situation of
individuals, does the -- does the due process rule
regarding taxation of individuals by a State align with
the -- the ability of somebody to sue that person in the
State?  Somebody -- for example, if someone is a partner
in a law firm that has offices all over the country,
they may be paying income taxes in many jurisdictions.
Are they subject to general jurisdiction?
If there's a -- if you have somebody who works in D.C.
and never goes to California, but has to pay some income
tax in California, are they subject to suit in
California for any --
MR. KNEEDLER:  No.
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- claim that arises against
them anywhere?
MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  No, they are not.
And -- and for the taxation, there has to -- for
taxation to begin with, there has to be some nexus
between the individual and the -- and the State.
The rules that I think Justice Sotomayor was
talking about in the Federal Tax Code has similar
provisions, really have to do with the measure of
taxation.  And in most of those situations, certainly,
in taxation among the States, there is an apportionment
formula.
Yes, the -- the overall income may be lumped
together for purposes of -- of the initial step, but
then there's an apportionment formula that says that --
in the Mobil case that's cited in the briefs, for
example, that -- that Vermont can only tax so much of
it, that portion that is fairly attributable to Vermont.
So in that sense, it's analogous to a
specific jurisdiction.  You're looking at -- you're
coming up with some formula to tie the taxation to the
State that is imposing -- imposing the tax.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kneedler, what do you
think about this, that -- you know, as I've been looking
through these cases, it seems to me that all these
attribution issues and the conflict about attribution
arises because courts generally have an improperly broad
understanding of general jurisdiction and don't quite
understand the distinction between general and specific
jurisdiction.
If the courts -- if the court here had
understood that general jurisdiction applies when a
company is essentially at home in a place, would any of
these questions have arisen?
MR. KNEEDLER:  Probably not.  The court of
appeals -- I think it's page 23 of its opinion -- says
that the reason that it looked to the -- the question of
whether the in-State activities of MBUSA were important
to Daimler was that the importance is a measure of the
presence, meaning essentially doing business within --
within California.
And as we point out in our brief, the Ninth
Circuit's approach to this traces back to early New York
cases that -- that address the question of doing
business at a time when the business --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that was -- that was
conceded.  But that was -- there is a very substantial
argument that there was no general jurisdiction over the
subsidiary, but that was not contested below.
MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And a party can always
consent to jurisdiction.
MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  Now -- but I think, in
a broader matter -- and also, I think the point that
Justice Kagan made earlier that even -- even if MBUSA
was subject to general jurisdiction or if we -- if
that's accepted for these purposes, that doesn't mean
that Daimler -- you wouldn't attribute MBUSA's
jurisdictional status to Daimler.
You might attribute its contacts, if the
appropriate rules for attribution of contacts work in
that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just as a way of getting
you to state your general theory of the case, let me ask
you, do you have a recommendation as to whether or not
we should remand this case?  If we accept your theory of
the case, which I'll let you explain, does that require
a remand?
MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- it does not.  And in
our view --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that is because?
MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  In -- in our view, it's
proper for the -- for the Court to look to background
principles of corporate law, at least as a starting
point or as a presumptive matter.  And in this country,
corporate separateness, under which a parent is not
liable for the acts of a subsidiary, is the general
rule.
There are established exceptions to that --
traditional exceptions, the alter ego exception and the
situation where a principal is responsible for the acts
of an agent.
Attribution on those bases, because they're
traditional, would not offend traditional notions of --
of fair play and substantial justice under the Due
Process Clause.  Here, Respondent does not argue --
Respondents do not argue for an -- that alter ego was
satisfy.
And as for agency, there's no argument here
that traditional agency requirements are satisfied.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under tradition, if you
have the universe of agent and principal, an independent
contractor, is the subsidiary of the latter or is it
something -- is it some third -- some third animal?
MR. KNEEDLER:  I think -- I think in this
case -- again, we don't have any reference to -- at
all --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Generally, if you have
a -- a corporate parent and a subsidiary, do we usually
think of a subsidiary as an agent?
MR. KNEEDLER:  No, you -- you do not.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do we think of it as --
what do we think about it as?  An independent
contractor?  Or just something else?
MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- it's an independent
entity.  It may be doing work for the parent, or it may
not.  In this case, at page 179A of the Joint Appendix,
the agreement between Daimler and -- and MBUSA
specifically provides that MBUSA is neither a special
nor a general agent.  It says that MBUSA cannot act on
behalf of or bind Daimler, and it's not a fiduciary.
What --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, you don't -- you
wouldn't have any doubt, would you, in the hypothetical
that I pose, a Mercedes Benz car causes an accident --
there's an accident in California.  It's alleged that
the accident was the defective manufacturing of that
car.  California people are injured.  There would be
jurisdiction in a California court.
MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I would think so,
particularly given the -- given the agreement in this
case which obligates Daimler to market throughout the 50
States, and the volume of sales that are directed to the
United States, some major portion of which is expected
to be and intended to be in California.  I don't think
there would be any question that California would have
specific jurisdiction.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, of course, that just
points out the difference between specific and general
jurisdiction, that Daimler might be -- might be found --
found it -- there's jurisdiction over Daimler in a case
which involves the blowing up of a car in California,
but not over something that's not related to any of its
contacts in California.
MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  That is -- that is
the -- the major -- that is the major difference.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What would have to be --
MR. KNEEDLER:  If I could make a point --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What would have to be
true for MBUSA to be Daimler's agent with respect to
general jurisdiction?  How would the facts of this case
have to be changed in order to bring this within an
agency principal?
MR. KNEEDLER:  I think -- I think MBUSA
would have to be acting on behalf of Daimler.  One step
in that direction would be if Daimler consigned the cars
to -- to MBUSA and that -- and MBUSA held itself out as
the sales agent.  Here, the cars were sold to MBUSA in
Germany and -- and sent to the United States.
But if there was an agency relationship,
that doesn't necessarily mean that Daimler would be at
home in -- in California or whatever --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, in most agency
relationships, titles stay with the principal.  So I
don't know -- or -- or when it doesn't, it transfers to
the agent, but for the benefit of the principal.  So I
don't know what the sale in Germany has to do.
MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- under this
agreement, MBUSA is -- acts independently.  It does not
act day to day directly.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it seems an odd
thing to say given the page and a half that the lower
court went through on the various ways in which Germany
controls this subsidiary.  It appoints all its officers.
It approves all its operating procedures.  It approves
all of the people it hires and fires.
It seems like there isn't much left for
what --
MR. KNEEDLER:  If I may --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't think there
was a question, but you can respond.
(Laughter.)
MR. KNEEDLER:  Those are contractual
undertakings.  They are not the manifestations of
agency.  Agency would require that -- that Daimler
control the day-to-day operations of this subsidiary.
And at page 116A of the petition appendix, the district
court says there's no evidence of that whatsoever.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Russell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN RUSSELL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. RUSSELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I'd like to begin with the question of
what's in this case and what isn't because the fact
pattern in this case gives rise to multiple complicated
questions, only two of which have been adequately
preserved in this case.  And one of the questions that's
not in the case, Justice Kagan, is whether or not, if
MBUSA's contacts are attributable, they are sufficient
to establish general jurisdiction.
This case has been in litigation on the
personal jurisdiction issue for eight years.  Throughout
that period, we have argued that if MBUSA's contacts
were attributed to Daimler, they were sufficient in kind
and quantity to support general jurisdiction over
Daimler itself.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if a Mercedes Benz
vehicle overturned in Poland and injured the Polish
driver and passenger, suit for the design defect could
be brought in California?
MR. RUSSELL:  That's right.  And if you
think that the answer to that is wrong, it's because of
the argument that Daimler did not preserve.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but, Mr. Russell, it's
usually -- it doesn't lead to good results when you
assume something that is obviously in error -- you know,
it leads you to go onto a road that you wouldn't
otherwise have gone onto and get to a destination that
might be improper itself.
So it's -- it's bad practice -- and I
understand your -- you know, idea about they didn't
argue this, they didn't argue that.  But to assume
something that's, obviously, a fallacy as your basis for
a decision is not likely to lead you to a good outcome.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, that might be a reason,
then, for this Court to dismiss this case as
improvidently granted.  A cert petition -- a grant of
cert shouldn't be a Get-Out-of-Jail-Free card.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Really, suppose I think
that this was crying out for an en banc.  After you got
your decision, we decided Goodyear, didn't we?  And yet,
even though there is no effort to reconcile the case
with Goodyear, as there couldn't be -- we hadn’t
decided it -- by the time we decided it, it still could
have been taken en banc.
MR. RUSSELL:  That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But I guess we have no
power at all to force the circuit, although that's what
they are there for, to consider such a matter en banc.
MR. RUSSELL:  That's because Petitioners
didn't raise that question en banc.  They filed an en
banc petition after Goodyear came down -- -
JUSTICE BREYER:  And they didn't say
anything about it --
MR. RUSSELL:  And they did not raise these
questions.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Russell, they did
talk about Daimler wasn't subject to general
jurisdiction.  They didn't contest MS -- MBUSA's being
subject to general jurisdiction, but they said Daimler
isn't subject to general jurisdiction.
So, you know, they didn't make the precise
argument that they should have made, but they basically
put the question at issue, is Daimler subject to general
jurisdiction?  Answer, no.  Daimler is a German
corporation.  If it were subject to -- subject to
general jurisdiction in California, so, too, it would be
subject to general jurisdiction in every State in the
United States, and all of that has got to be wrong.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, with respect, Justice
Kagan, it's not as easy as you seem to think it is.  Let
me give you an example.  In Perkins, this Court cited a
prior case as a quintessential paradigmatic example of
general jurisdiction, called Barrow Steamship Company v.
Kane.
And in that case, it approved -- this Court
approved the exercise of general jurisdiction in New
York over a British steamship company for a tort that
occurred in Ireland, based on the fact that it had an
office run, actually, by another company -- a mercantile
company called Henderson --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was -- what was the
year of that decision?
MR. RUSSELL:  That was 1898.  But this
Court --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but the thinking
about jurisdiction has changed enormously since then.
MR. RUSSELL:  But my point is that this
Court in Perkins, which is quite a long time after
International Shoe, cited to Barrows as an example of a
paradigmatic example.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If there was ever an
example of a corporation being at home in a particular
place, it's Perkins against Benguet.  It was a
Philippine company that was shut down entirely.  It was
World War II.  To the extent the company was operating
at all, it was in Ohio.
It was not able to operate in what otherwise
would have been its home base, so everything that the
corporation was doing occurred in Ohio.
MR. RUSSELL:  Justice Ginsburg, just to be
clear, I'm not saying that this case is like Perkins.
I'm saying that, in Perkins, a post-International Shoe
case, this Court embraced the result in Barrows, which
is a case quite like this one.
And more --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Russell, I'm still hung
up on -- on why we have to confront a Federal
constitutional question.  It doesn't seem to me that a
State statute which says we want to exercise
jurisdiction to the extent the Constitution permits -- I
don't think that invites a Court to restructure standard
State law and to say, we're -- we're not going to
observe the corporate distinction.
I guess you'd have to say we can hold the
individual shareholders of a corporation liable because
that might not violate the Constitution.  I don't think
that when -- when California adopts this statute it
means to change its -- its standard law regarding
corporations, regarding individuals, and so forth.
Why -- why should we assume that?
MR. RUSSELL:  Because Petitioner, again,
didn't make that argument, either --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But, now, we're -- look at
the odd thing.  It might not violate the Constitution.
I mean, it's the same question, but it is bothering me,
too.  It might not violate the Constitution of the
United States, for a State to say, we don't have limited
liability in respect to the subsidiary corporation of
a general corporation.
It's very unlikely to do that.  It's going
to be a big problem to get investment in that State, but
it might not violate -- it might not violate the
Constitution as here, to say -- you know, we are, in
California, not going to have subsidiaries when a
plaintiff comes in and sues on the basis of something
that happened outside the country; but we will have it
when, in fact, he sues on something that happened in
California.  Now, a State could do that, I guess, but
it's pretty odd.
And if you look what the -- what the Ninth
Circuit said in its opinion, it never referred to
California law directly.  It's all Ninth Circuit cases
or Second Circuit cases.  The only thing it says about
California is probably something that was quoted in the
Ninth Circuit case, something like that.
So what am I supposed to do?  Because State
law is up to the State.  How do I handle that?
MR. RUSSELL:  This case has been litigated
on the interpretation of the California statute that
says that California intended, notwithstanding what
rules it applies for liability, to exercise personal
jurisdiction to the furthest extent permitted by the
Constitution.
And here, it's not that difficult a
question.  Here, the question is, if Petitioner would
have been subject to general jurisdiction in California,
had it conducted the same operations through a
subdivision in the case, does the Due Process Clause
give it a constitutional right to avoid that
jurisdiction simply by conducting those same operations
through a wholly-owned subsidiary --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So you think, in other
words, that California has abolished -- I mean,
California says there is no corporate insulation, a
corporation, when it tries to work through a subsidiary,
that subsidiary has unlimited liability from lawsuits in
California?  Is that what you think California law is?
MR. RUSSELL:  California wants to go as far
as the Constitution would permit.  We're not asking --
JUSTICE BREYER:  The answer then to my
question is yes.  You think right today, in California,
the law is there is no -- there is unlimited liability
for a corporation that is a subsidiary of another?
MR. RUSSELL:  Not that there is unlimited
liability, but that the exercise --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you can bring a
lawsuit, unlimited liability.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. --
MR. RUSSELL:  Because the statute at issue
doesn't speak to liability, it speaks to personal
jurisdiction.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Russell, is it clear
that the California law regarding corporate liability
would apply to all of your claims?
MR. RUSSELL:  No.
JUSTICE ALITO:  You have -- you have Federal
claims, you have Argentine claims; isn't that correct?
MR. RUSSELL:  That's correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  California law controls
personal jurisdiction.  It doesn't, does it, necessarily
control corporate liability, let's say, with respect to
the Argentine claims?
MR. RUSSELL:  No, it certainly wouldn't.
The choice of law principles would almost certainly
point to Argentine law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, but -- but why
should we -- now that the Federal claims are out -- I
mean, when you started the suit, you had a claim under
the Alien Tort Statute, you had a claim under the
Torture Victims Protection Act, but now, those Federal
claims are out, and we are left with a claim under
California law and Argentinian law.
Why should a Federal forum exercise
supplemental jurisdiction over those claims once the
Federal claims are out of the picture?
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, certainly, we -- we
agree that if this case were remanded to the district
court it would have discretion to refuse to exercise
supplemental jurisdiction.  I would --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wouldn't it be arbitrary
for it to exercise personal jurisdiction when there is
no Federal claim and the case involves foreign
plaintiffs injured abroad, allegedly due to the
activities of a subsidiary operating abroad?
MR. RUSSELL:  Ultimately, we don't think so.
I think you would have to take into account this case
has been in litigation for eight years already.  I think
that's a substantial reason for the Court to want to
allow the case to continue.
I recognize that we would have a very hard
time appealing from a decision that refused to exercise
supplemental jurisdiction.  But, again, on the question
that the Court actually granted cert on and which was
actually preserved here, I do think that the Court could
simply hold that, look, attribution of contacts between
a wholly-owned subsidiary and its parents is not so
unreasonable as to violate the Constitution.
At the end of the day, the due process
question is whether the defendant had sufficiently
availed itself of the benefits of doing business in the
State to warrant an exercise of jurisdiction.  It can do
that either directly, through its --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but that test that
you just -- the sufficiently purposeful availing, those
are all specific jurisdiction questions.
MR. RUSSELL:  With respect --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And not general
jurisdiction questions.
MR. RUSSELL:  With respect, I -- I don't
think that's correct.  Justice Kennedy's opinion for the
plurality in Castro, for example, identified the
underlying premise of both general and specific
jurisdiction and availing oneself of the benefits of
being in the State.  And --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And Goodyear
distinguished the two by saying general jurisdiction
means it's equivalent to residence for an individual.
It's where you are at home.
The -- and general jurisdiction was much
broader in the days before long-arm statutes.  But now
that we have specific jurisdiction, so you can sue where
the event occurred, just as specific jurisdiction has
expanded, so general jurisdiction has shrunk.
MR. RUSSELL:  I understand that there are
very serious and important questions with respect to
what it means to be at home in a State.  And that, if
Petitioner had raised those arguments below, it might
actually have prevailed.  But this Court ought not to
forgive that waiver in a case like this, and it ought
not to decide that question when, not only is the
argument forfeit, but it's barely been briefed in this
case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I understood
the concession as being, that if Mercedes were the only
corporation involved in this dispute, there would be
specific -- sufficient contacts.  That -- that doesn't
tell me anything about Daimler.
MR. RUSSELL:  That is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm -- I'm not so sure
that this concession is that troublesome for Daimler.
MR. RUSSELL:  No.  There has been one
concession, which is that MBUSA's contacts are
sufficient to subject MBUSA itself to general
jurisdiction.  And there's been one forfeiture --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So how does that answer
the question about Daimler?
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, because there's been one
forfeiture as well.  And that is, we've argued for 8 --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There has been one?
MR. RUSSELL:  Forfeiture, as well.  We have
argued for 8 years that, if you attribute the contacts
in MBUSA to Daimler, those contacts are sufficient to
establish general jurisdiction over Daimler.  They're
sufficient to satisfy the minimum --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  For any claim arising
anyplace in the world.
MR. RUSSELL:  That's right.  That's been our
argument.  They could have said, no, that's not right.
They could have said, MBUSA doesn't do enough business
in California.  They could have said that general --
that doing business theory of general jurisdiction is no
good.  They could have said, you can only be subject
to general jurisdiction --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I think their
concession is quite consistent with the proposition that
the distinction between parent and subsidiary is
meaningful for jurisdictional purposes.  And that you're
not just automatically an agent -- you, yourself, do not
defend the Ninth Circuit's position that, if Daimler
gives enough functions to Mercedes that it has to give,
that then Daimler is -- is liable.
You don't -- your footnote, I think page 35
of your brief, you -- you don't take the Ninth Circuit's
reasoning to its full extent.
MR. RUSSELL:  That's right.  We do think
that this is an easier case because we have a
wholly-owned subsidiary that operates in very much the
same way as a subdivision would.  Notice that in the
Federal --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Russell, could I --
does it not follow from -- from your argument that a
Federal court should entertain a suit against the
shareholders of a foreign corporation when that foreign
corporation has sufficient contacts in California?
MR. RUSSELL:  No, I don't think it does.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why --
MR. RUSSELL:  But the question, ultimately,
is whether it's fair to say that the defendant has
sufficiently benefitted from --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is it any less fair?
MR. RUSSELL:  Because, unlike a shareholder,
a parent company enjoys not only the economic benefits
of the subsidiary's activities --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't the shareholders?
MR. RUSSELL:  They -- they enjoy a partial.
But in addition, they have -- the parent has the right
and, here, the substantial right to control the day to
day --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't the shareholders?
MR. RUSSELL:  No, they don't.  All the
shareholders have the right to do is appoint the -- the
people to the board.  Here, Daimler exercised a degree
of control that is much more significant than that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I can't see a
distinction.  And I think, if you stretch the California
statute as far as you're stretching it, you -- you have
to assume that California would exercise jurisdiction in
that case --
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I don't think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- if you're the Ninth
Circuit.
MR. RUSSELL:  I don't think that's right.  I
mean, this Court has recognized that, look, the Due
Process Clause requires, ultimately, drawing some lines,
but it can't be done in a mechanical way.
Here, Goodyear provides a safe harbor to
companies that want to make sure that they're not
subject to general jurisdiction in California.  They can
do so by selling their cars to an independent
distributor, the way Petitioner used to do and the way
that Toyota still does.
But with respect to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if you go -- if you
go back to the -- to the foundation case of
International Shoe, that case recognized that you can be
an agent for one purpose, but not for another.  So the
people -- the salesmen who were promoting the sales of
shoes were the agents of International Shoe for the
purpose of promoting the sale of shoes.  They were not
an all-purpose agent for the purpose of, say, dealing --
real estate dealings on behalf of the corporations.
So you could have an agency for one purpose,
selling cars in California, but totally unrelated to
torturing people in Argentina.
MR. RUSSELL:  That's right.  But the -- but
that -- I think we need to separate the two ideas of
what does it take to make Petitioner at home in
California.  Once it's established that it is at home in
California, it is simply a traditional aspect of general
jurisdiction that it will be subject to suit for things
that happened abroad.
If this suit had been brought against Apple
Computer, which is headquartered in California, I don't
think we would be here today.  The question here is
whether the -- the conduct in California is rendered
insufficient by virtue of the fact that it was
undertaken by a subsidiary.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It’s the same problem, and I
don't know what to do.  It's really -- Justice Scalia
has been mentioning this problem.  You're seeing it
through the lens of jurisdiction.  I'm not.  I'm seeing
it through the lens of corporate law.  Five shareholders
get together from outside California, and they set up a
corporation in California.  Why?  To insulate themselves
from liability, particularly lawsuits.
Now, instead of those five shareholders,
everything is the same, but now, it's a German
corporation, and suddenly, they can't insulate
themselves from the lawsuits in California.  I think it
unlikely that California would have such a corporate
law, whether it goes by the name of jurisdiction or some
other name, but that's a State law question.
So what am I supposed to do?  That's where
we started this argument.  And that's what I --
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, Justice Breyer, if you
think -- if you think that the -- the proper resolution
of a case like this turns on issues that were not
preserved below and have not been argued here, then you
can do one of two things.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What?
MR. RUSSELL:  You can dismiss the case as
improvidently granted, or you can decide the case on the
assumptions upon which it's been litigated and make
clear that you're doing that.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, another thing we
could do is we could say we've decided, now, two cases
that seem to bear on this, and one is Goodyear, and the
other is Kiobel; and we could say we'll send it back for
consideration of this case, in light of those.
MR. RUSSELL:  We would have no problem with
that if you made clear that it was open to us under
remand to argue that they didn't preserve these
arguments.  That would be a fine result for us.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Breyer
mentioned --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm sorry Chief.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- mentioned Kiobel.
Do you still think you have a viable claim under Kiobel,
or haven't you conceded that?
MR. RUSSELL:  We are not prepared to concede
that at this point, although we recognize we have an
uphill struggle to fit ourselves within the exception
that's been left.  Principally, our argument would be
based on the fact that, at the time of suit, this was a
dual American/German company with dual headquarters
in -- in the United States, which is different than
Shell.
But we -- we're not prepared to concede it,
but we're not asking this Court to resolve it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If this is as -- as
Justice Breyer and I seem to think, a question of State
law, don't you think it's extraordinary that the Ninth
Circuit could make such a significant holding on -- on
California law without -- there is a certification
procedure in California, isn't there?
MR. RUSSELL:  There is, although --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So why -- why wouldn't they
have asked the California Supreme Court whether --
whether this jurisdiction statute was meant to alter
corporate law or -- you know, tort law, or -- you
know -- just imagine any change in law that would bear
upon jurisdiction, and all those changes must be assumed
to have happened.
Couldn't -- couldn't they ask that?  Is that
what this California jurisdictional statute means?
MR. RUSSELL:  Sure.  They could have asked
that.  Usually, they only ask those questions --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it too late to ask it
now?
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, it wouldn't be, if you
sent it back.  I mean, usually, courts of appeals don't
ask those questions unless somebody asks them to.  And
here, Petitioner never asked them to.  It assumed, as
did we, that the statute meant that they wanted the most
permissive attribution rule that's permitted by the Due
Process Clause.  And I don't think it's unreasonable --
that's an unreasonable interpretation of the statute.
I recognize that it's a little bit
problematic, that these statutes don't give greater
definitive guidance.  But Petitioner hasn't complained
about that either.
And so on the -- the premises on which this
case was litigated, I do think you can decide this case
by resolving two questions.  First, on the assumption
that if MBUSA's contacts are attributable to Petitioner,
they are sufficient to make it at home, does the fact
that those contacts are through a wholly-owned
subsidiary, rather than a subdivision, make the exercise
of general jurisdiction improper --
JUSTICE ALITO:  But if we assume, for the
sake of argument, that there isn't a preservation issue
regarding this in-home -- this at-home question, why
shouldn't the rule be that, unless a corporation is
incorporated in the jurisdiction or has its principal
place of business in the jurisdiction, the -- the acts
of the subsidiary are not attributable, unless it's an
alter ego.
It's a nice, clean rule.  Many of the
prominent scholars in this area think that the American
doctrine of general jurisdiction doesn't serve any good
purpose.  Now, that specific jurisdiction has been
expanded, it makes us an international outlier.  Why
shouldn't we have a nice, clear rule like that, and
everybody will know exactly where things stand?
MR. RUSSELL:  Just to be clear, there are
two parts to that rule.  There is one that's the
assertion that ordinarily, you're only at home in the
place of principal business or principal -- principal
place of business or place of incorporation.  And the
other is, oh, we'll only apply that rule with respect to
subsidiary contacts.
That additional thing, which is necessary
to -- to shoehorn it into this case, I think, is very
artificial.  So if this Court is going to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is -- what is the
additional thing?
MR. RUSSELL:  That we will only apply that
rule if the contacts, if I understand Justice Alito's
proposal, we only apply that rule if this -- if the
contacts in the State are through a subsidiary.  That's
a very artificial gerrymander, honestly, to fit the
facts of this case.
If this Court is going to say that the doing
business theory of general jurisdiction is no longer
good law, it should do so directly, it should do so on
a case has actually been briefed.  It hasn't been
briefed here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You did say, in your
brief, that recognizing that other nations are highly
critical of our expansive -- at one-time expansive
notion of doing business as a basis for general
jurisdiction, you say that that shouldn't be taken into
account as a basis for constitutional decisionmaking.
And yet, what we are talking about is a
notion of whether it's fair and reasonable to require a
corporation to answer in a forum and is -- is what the
other countries think unenlightening on what's fair and
reasonable?
MR. RUSSELL:  I don't know that you can't
take it into account at all, but I will say that the --
the constitutional test is whether it's consistent with
traditional notions of fairness and justice, meaning
traditional American notions of -- of substantial
fairness.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Russell, how would you
make the argument -- and, again, with Justice Alito,
sort of putting these waiver questions aside for a
second, German corporation, incorporated in Germany,
headquartered in Germany, 2.4 percent of its sales are
in California.
How do you argue that it's subject to
jurisdiction, general jurisdiction, not specific
jurisdiction, general jurisdiction, which means over
suits that have nothing to do with California or,
indeed, as here, over in the United States, have nothing
to do with anything that happened in the United States,
how do you make the argument that Daimler is subject to
general jurisdiction?
MR. RUSSELL:  I would say a couple things.
I haven't briefed this, but this is what I would say in
a brief, if we had the opportunity to brief it.  And
that is it has done billions of dollars in business in
California.  It's --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's 2.4 percent of its
sales.  That would make it subject to general
jurisdiction every place.
MR. RUSSELL:  But the problem -- but the
problem is a corporation shouldn't be jurisdictionally
better off simply because it's bigger than its
competitors who are smaller and, therefore, necessarily
do a bigger portion of their business in a smaller
number of places.
I think it's -- there is a very significant
fairness problem with the proportionality test suggested
by the government, again, never raised in this case.
Nobody ever argued that MBUSA didn't do enough business
in California, and in fact, it's done billions of
dollars of business there, and it's enjoyed the benefits
of being in the State, of doing business in the State,
to a far greater degree than many of its competitors,
say Tesla, which is subject to general jurisdiction for
suits for anything that it does anywhere in the world.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  If it is subject to general
jurisdiction in California, is it subject to general
jurisdiction in all 49 other States?
MR. RUSSELL:  I think there would still be a
question of whether -- they would be able to raise
the -- the arguments that they haven't raised in other
jurisdictions.  It may be that the billions of dollars
that they are doing business in California is enough,
but the few millions of dollars they do in Iowa is not.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So everybody is subject to
general jurisdiction in, like, California and New York
and Florida because they are big markets, but no worries
about -- you know, Delaware?
MR. RUSSELL:  That may be the result --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's a bad example.  Rhode
Island.
(Laughter.)
MR. RUSSELL:  That may be the case if -- the
Court has always recognized that doing business is
enough.  Back to the Barrow case, when just having an
office, a sales office -- another case that this Court
cited in Perkins and cited in International Shoe as an
example of a paradigmatic case was a case called Hausa,
by then-Judge Cardozo.  And it was a suit by somebody from
New York, who sued in New York, sued a Pennsylvania
corporation, and the justification was it had a sales
office in New York.
Now, if this Court thinks that those cases
were wrong, if it thinks that we need to change our
conceptions of general jurisdiction, in light of the
evolved modern --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't that exactly what
Goodyear held?
MR. RUSSELL:  No.  Goodyear didn't purport
to change anything.  I know you used a new phrase to
describe the prior precedent, but it wasn't purporting
to revise it, and I don't think that there was
substantial argument in that case on that score.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, there would hardly
be room for a decision next to Goodyear that says, oh,
for general jurisdiction purposes, it's enough that you
have some subsidiary operating in the State.  The whole
idea of Goodyear was to say, there is one place you can
always sue a corporation, one or two, place of
incorporation, a place -- principal place of business.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, again, if I can just
respond to that idea, the one consequence of that -- and
getting back to what I would say to Justice Kagan -- is
people aren't subject to general jurisdiction only in
one or two places.  They are subject to general
jurisdiction anywhere they set foot and are served with
process.  And I think it is quite unfair to say --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But people can be only
one place at a time.
MR. RUSSELL:  But they go a lot of places
over time.  And as a consequence, they are, in fact, in
the course of living their lives or even doing business
in an unincorporated forum, subject to general
jurisdiction in a lot of places.
Again, this is an important question that
hasn't been briefed in this case, it wasn't preserved
below, and I think that you ought to decide the case on
the grounds, on the premises on which it has been
litigated for eight years.  And if you can't do that,
you ought to dismiss the case as improvidently granted
or at least remand the case to allow a full airing of
these issues in an appropriate forum.
JUSTICE ALITO:  If this 2.4 percent figure
is important, wouldn't we get into impossible
line-drawing problems?  What if it was 1.4 percent?
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, you do get into
line-drawing problems in this area.  This Court has
recognized that, even in specific jurisdiction cases.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You think it should be
billions of dollars, right?  We're talking about
percentage, right?
MR. RUSSELL:  I think billions of dollars is
enough.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So we've got to pick a
dollar amount, rather than a percentage.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, you have to pick some
metric.  I mean, this Court's cases have always been
general.  They have talked about minimum contacts.  They
have talked about systematic and continuous business
operations in the State.
And those -- the Court has always recognized
that those are not standards that are capable of
mechanical operation or brightline rules.  If you think
that you need to develop some new standards, you ought
to do it in a case when it is squarely presented and
adequately briefed.
If there are no further questions?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Dupree, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DUPREE, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DUPREE:  Just a few brief points.
First, with regard to Justice Breyer's question about
remand, I think there is absolutely no reason for this
Court to remand this case to the Ninth Circuit.  The
issues as to attribution were fully briefed below.  They
are fully briefed here.  I think that, were this Court
to either remand the case or dismiss the case, for one
thing, the circuit split would persist.  The Ninth
Circuit's decision in the event of a remand would remain
on the books.
Even if this Court were to remand the
decision of the Second Circuit, which --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you really care how
we do it?  Given that so many issues have not been
adequately briefed, conceded when they are, obviously,
fallacious and unsupportable, why don't we just say,
simply, exercise of jurisdiction is unreasonable in this
case?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, Justice Sotomayor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The other side --
neither you or the other side have argued that there
isn't a reasonableness component.  I know some of my
colleagues don't think there is.  But both of you have
proceeded in your briefing as if there is.  Do you care
how you win?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, yes, Your Honor, I think
we do.  I think we do.  And let me say this:  I think
that, with regard to Your Honor's points about issues
being waived or forfeited below, the only issue that
even arguably -- even arguably was forfeited below was
the discrete question as to whether Mercedes Benz itself
is subject to general jurisdiction in California.
The question that Justice Kagan and others
were inquiring about, namely, that even were one to
accept the attribution theory and evaluate Daimler as a
joint enterprise, would that render the combined
enterprise at home in California, we plainly did not
waive or forfeit that question.
In fact, we expressly addressed it in our
opening brief, and we have been fighting in this case,
from day one, to argue that, even if you were to
attribute the contacts, there is no basis for
jurisdiction over Daimler.  That question is squarely
presented for this Court's review.
I also think that -- as Justice Ginsburg and
others have noted, there has been some confusion in the
lower courts over the distinction between specific
jurisdiction and general jurisdiction.  This Court saw
it in Goodyear, for example, and I think that, were this
Court to resolve this case on the ground that Justice
Kagan suggested -- or Justice Alito suggested, namely,
that a corporation cannot be at home outside of the
areas where it maintains its principal place of business
or is incorporated, that it can't be subject to general
jurisdiction anywhere else.
That would be a clean rule.  It would be a
workable rule.  I think it's fully consistent with what
the Court said in Goodyear, and it would provide clarity
and guidance to the lower courts and eliminate the
circuit split that currently exists over agency
jurisdiction.
A couple other quick points, Justice Scalia,
I regret to report that neither the parties nor the
courts below reproduced the text of the California
statute.  The Solicitor General, however, to his credit,
did on page 4 of his brief.  It simply says that,
"California may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not
inconsistent with the Constitution of California or the
United States."
And the Ninth Circuit panel, on page 19A of
the Petitioner's appendix, said that, therefore, the
question is this case -- in this case is simply whether
the exercise of jurisdiction would exceed the
permissible bounds of due process.
The last point I want to make -- and we've
been discussing legal issues -- is just to remind the
Court of the facts of this case.  This is a case
involving Argentine plaintiffs, suing a German
corporation, based on events that allegedly occurred in
Argentina more than 30 years ago.  This case has no
connection to the United States, and it has no business
in a California courtroom.
The Ninth Circuit's contrary conclusion is
indefensible, and for that reason, we ask that the
judgment be reversed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Counsel.
