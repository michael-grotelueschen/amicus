CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
next in Case 13-483, Lane v. Franks.
Mr. Singh?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TEJINDER SINGH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SINGH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Petitioner, Mr. Edward Lane, alleges that
Respondent, Steve Franks, fired him in retaliation for
his testimony before a Federal grand jury in district
court on a matter that is undisputedly a public concern,
the misconduct of a State legislator.
Petitioner testified about events that he
learned while working, but the testimony itself was not
a part of his job responsibilities.
This Court should hold that Petitioner's
testimony implicates the First Amendment because he
spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  It
should further hold that this was clearly established in
2009 when Respondent Franks fired him.
Those fold -- holdings follow from a long
line of this Court's precedents, which establishes that
the First Amendment applies to all public employee
speech on matters of public concern, except when the
employee speaks pursuant to his official duties.
The remainder of the case, including the
application of the Pickering balancing test and
Respondent's other defenses can all be addressed on
remand.
This Court can also leave for another day
the question of whether a public employee who testifies
in court but pursuant to his official responsibilities
would be protected.
The way the case has shaken out in the
briefing, the principal point of contention has become
whether the fact that Petitioner learned the facts about
which he testified at work is sufficient to deprive his
testimony of protection.
But for decades --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it -- what if the
person who testified had the definite job responsibility
of investigating possible corruption in the agency?
Suppose that that person was something like an Inspector
General.
MR. SINGH:  If --
JUSTICE ALITO:  When would the testimony
be -- be within the scope of the person's job duties?
MR. SINGH:  I think it would depend on the
circumstances of the particular case.
And that would be the exact next question,
because the responsibility to investigate by itself does
not necessarily also include the responsibility to
testify.  And so in certain cases you could imagine
where there is an internal investigator whose job is to
deal with issues internally and that wouldn't be covered
by job responsibilities.  But there may be other cases
in which that investigator also regularly testifies.
In this case, there is no dispute that my
client's responsibility was to manage the staff of his
department and therefore to deal with issues that arose.
But there is also no dispute that he was never expected
to testify in court and that this testimony was all the
result of a subpoena issued by a Federal court in
response to a request from Federal prosecutors.  And so
I think that that is the -- that case gets us towards
the harder question that this Court doesn't have to
decide in this case.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, just to follow up on
that, could there be ever a situation in which a
government employee's testimony is within the scope of
that employee's duties if the employee is not -- does
not testify on behalf of his employer?
MR. SINGH:  I think that there is --
JUSTICE ALITO:  If the employee is
subpoenaed by -- by the opposite side, then you would
say that's enough, that makes the testimony outside the
scope of the employee's responsibilities?
MR. SINGH:  I think that would be strong
evidence.  In Garcetti v. Ceballos this Court
articulated the scope of an employee's duties and the
determination of whether an employee is acting in the
scope of those duties is a practical inquiry, and so it
would vary considerably case to case.  I think the fact
of a subpoena is strong evidence that when an employee
testifies he is not doing so because it's his job to do
so.  There is a separate and very strong obligation.
But again, that's really just one --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I think you're --
let's use the quintessential example, police officers or
lab technicians.  Generally they are called by the
prosecutor, but occasionally they are called by defense
attorneys.  So when are they immunized and when are they
not?  When are they acting within the scope of their
duties and when are they not?
MR. SINGH:  Your Honor, in those cases I
think there would be an argument that in every case they
are acting in the scope of their duties if you consider
the practical circumstances that give rise to that
testimony.  But there is also an argument, and this is
sort of the strong version of the First Amendment, the
argument that we make -- this is not the rule that we
are asking for, but this is the rule that's asked for by
the ACLU, by a couple of the other amici.
The strong version of the First Amendment
argument is that even in those circumstances there is a
separate and a superior obligation to testify truthfully
to the court, that is, to provide information in a way
that is unbiased toward the interests of the employer.
And recognizing First Amendment protection furthers that
interest because it frees the employee to testify
candidly and completely.  And, Your Honor mentioned the
word "immunity" --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what happens in a
situation where a police officer gets on the stand and
in testifying honestly admits to corruption, admits to
-- or does it in a slovenly way, comes to court dressed
in a clown suit?  Could the employer fire him then?
MR. SINGH:  I think the answer is almost
certainly yes, and that occurs through the application
of the Pickering balancing test.  The way that First
Amendment protection for employee speech has worked
since the 1960s is that when speech relates to a matter
of public concern, the speech -- the First Amendment
applies.
The next question, which is whether the
employer discipline is nevertheless permitted, is a
function of a balancing of the employee's interest in
speaking and society's interest in hearing the speech
versus the employer's interest in effectively and
efficiently providing public services.
In the case of the clown suit, in the case
of testimony that's unprepared, reflects badly on the
department, all of those are justifications that any
employer can use to argue that, even though the First
Amendment applies, discipline is nevertheless warranted.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there any -- would
there be any Pickering balancing in this case?
MR. SINGH:  If this Court --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If the Court says that
speech is protected, would there be any need to go on
these facts into a Pickering balance?
MR. SINGH:  Your Honor, we don't believe
that in the summary judgment record there is any
evidence that my client's speech was at all disruptive,
and that's why the United States has argued that if you
perform the balancing test here yourself you can find in
our favor.  Nevertheless, we think it's okay to remand
that question.  We haven't briefed it.  We haven't asked
you to decide it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we are asked to
decide the qualified immunity and how can we find there
is no qualified immunity in view of the Morris v. Crow
decision?
MR. SINGH:  We think the Morris decision is
plainly distinguishable.  There are a few arguments that
we would raise against that decision.  The first is, and
this is a point that's been made by not only us but also
the United States and the Alabama attorney general, that
Morris is flatly contrary to this Court's precedents.
All of the emphasis in Morris on whether the employee
was intending to speak out on a matter of public concern
finds no support in the way this Court has applied the
rules relating to public employee speech.  But --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That means the Eleventh
Circuit is wrong.  Should the employee be victimized
because they were following circuit bad precedent?
Whether it's good or bad doesn't matter under our
jurisprudence.
MR. SINGH:  Your Honor, I would be willing
to concede, if the case were clearly on point, that
qualified immunity should perhaps nevertheless apply.  I
think it's highly questionable, but it's an open
question and I would be willing to concede that.
The reason -- the real reason that Morris is
not a problem for us at all is that Morris is not close
to the facts of this case.  In Morris, a sheriff's
accident investigator prepared an internal report
describing a car accident in which another sheriff
caused a civilian death.  The report surmised that the
accident was the sheriff's fault.  And then he was
subpoenaed to testify in the civil wrongful death case.
He was shortly fired thereafter.
He brought a claim seeking both
protection of the report itself, which of course is on
all fours with this Court's decision in Garcetti holding
that an internal memorandum prepared in the course of
official duties is not protected.  He also sought
protection for his deposition testimony describing it.
We do think the Eleventh Circuit was wrong
to hold that that testimony was unprotected, but it's of
no moment, because private, closed door civil deposition
testimonies describing bad driving are nothing like
public trial testimony describing public corruption.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there a different
Eleventh -- Is there a different Eleventh Circuit case
he should have looked at?  I mean, you don't think this
is close, but is there a closer precedent that he should
have looked at?
MR. SINGH:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, there
is.  In 1992 the Eleventh Circuit decided a case called
Martinez v. City of Opa-Locka.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but it was
expressly distinguished in Morris.
MR. SINGH:  But it was distinguished only on
grounds that would also distinguish this case.  The
grounds on which the Eleventh Circuit distinguished
Martinez in Morris were that the testimony was in a
public proceeding and that it identified public
corruption, which is exactly what happened here.  And so
we think there is no sound basis upon which the Eleventh
Circuit could say Morris doesn't apply -- Martinez
doesn't apply and Morris does.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why should we get to
that question?  It wasn't decided below.  It's their
law.  Why shouldn't we kick it back to the Eleventh
Circuit?
MR. SINGH:  I'm sorry, I think the qualified
immunity question was decided below.  The Eleventh
Circuit both found that there was no constitutional
right, but also I believe footnote 2 of the court's
opinion says because we find that there is no right we
would also find no qualified immunity.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  My mistake.
MR. SINGH:  And so the issue is squarely
before you.  And I think that it's -- getting to that
question does not require the Court to do very much
work.  We're not asking for a new rule of law relating
to qualified immunity.  We're not asking you to dilute
the protection that officers currently have.  What we
are asking for is a relatively straightforward
application of this Court's precedents in, for example,
Groh.
JUSTICE BREYER:  We might have to send it
back.  If we were to say, yes, they did violate the
Constitution, next question would be is it clear?  I
mean, the Second Circuit thought they didn't
violate the Constitution.  Isn't that right?
MR. SINGH:  That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And so they say obviously
they didn't violate the Constitution, they didn't
clearly violate the Constitution.  So if we were to say,
no, you did violate the Constitution, that footnote does
not express any view.
MR. SINGH:  That's -- that's correct.  The
Eleventh Circuit did not rule on whether --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So if they got the whole
thing wrong from beginning to end, they might have to
send it back, we send it back and say you got it wrong, it
did violate the Constitution; now tell us if it's clear.
So which should we do, decide it ourselves
whether it was clear, it’s a matter of Eleventh Circuit
precedent or should we send it back to their tender
mercy?
MR. SINGH:  I think you should decide the
question, Your Honor.  I think that the principal
guidance that the lower courts require is clarity about
what the constitutional standard is.  Once you write the
opinion explaining that there was a violation of the
Constitution in this case, I think that that opinion
will establish that it's clear and it will establish
that it was clear in 2009.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Those are two very
different things.  You spend a fair amount of time in
your brief talking about court of appeals decisions from
other circuits.  But I think it's a little bit of a
heroic leap to assume that employees are familiar with
court of appeals decisions in their own circuit.  Do you
really think we should be looking at the opinions from
other circuits in deciding whether the law was clearly
established in a different circuit?
MR. SINGH:  In -- in Ashcroft vs. al-Kidd,
this Court articulated the standard for qualified
immunity as either there's controlling precedent in the
jurisdiction or there is a consensus of persuasive
authorities.  And we've cited a couple of cases decided
after Garcetti from other circuits holding that public
employee speech was protected.  I don't want that to
obscure the fact that before Garcetti, there were many,
many, many more cases.  There was an overwhelming
consensus in the circuits that this type of testimony
was protected.  The Eleventh Circuit really is out on
its own here.  And when you consider the strength of
that consensus --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if you say the
Eleventh Circuit is out on its own, it seems to me to be
a concession that their law is different from the law
that you're arguing for.  And, again, my point is:  Do
you ask a -- a State employee to recognize, yes, this is
the law in the Eleventh Circuit, but they're out on
their own.  So we're going to follow a -- a different
law?
MR. SINGH:  Your Honor, our argument is that
the Eleventh Circuit was wrong, but until this case,
they weren't wrong enough to justify this result.  In
1992, the Martinez case set down clear markers that
would allow and should have compelled a result in our
favor.  In this case, Martinez was raised below and the
Eleventh Circuit simply ignored it, choosing to rely
instead on Morris.  We think that was a very grave
mistake of interpreting not only this Court's law, but
Eleventh Circuit law.  And we think that especially in
light of this Court's precedents, that misinterpretation
of Eleventh Circuit precedent was especially egregious.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I go back to my point,
which is they got it wrong.  But do we expect the
employee to know they got it wrong or under what
circumstances do we expect them to know?
MR. SINGH:  I think an instructive case is
Groh v. Ramirez.  In that case, it was a Fourth
Amendment case involving a warrant that didn't state
particulars on its face.  The district court found that
there was no Fourth Amendment violation at all.  The
circuit court affirmed on grounds of qualified immunity,
and this Court reversed on both grounds, said there was
a violation and the violation was clear.
And one of the points that the Court made,
and this is in Footnote 9 of the Court's opinion, was
that that was not a case in which, for example, police
officers make split-second judgments in the field.  That
was a case where an officer had ample time to figure out
what the law was.  Here we're dealing with a university
administrator, who has a general counsel, who has the
ability to consult that counsel before making any
personnel decisions.  And the qualified immunity
standard has always asked, what would a reasonable
official in the position of the relevant Defendant have
done.  So there may be cases in which it would be very
hard for an employee --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Tell me what
you want as your rule.  Anyone subpoenaed in a criminal
trial is protected?
MR. SINGH:  No, Your Honor.  We're not
asking the Court to rule that broadly in this case.  All
we want is a rule that says when a public employee
testifies on a matter of public concern and does not do
so pursuant to his job responsibilities, the First
Amendment protects that testimony subject to the
Pickering balance that it always has.  And that is, in
fact, the rule that this Court laid down in Garcetti.
To the extent that any clarification is required, the
only clarification would be that even when the testimony
describes facts that the employee learned in the course
of employment, it's still protected.  But that's not a
leap at all from this Court's precedents.
If I could reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Gershengorn?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING
AFFIRMANCE IN PART AND REVERSAL IN PART
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
In Garcetti, this Court recognized that the
government, like any private employer, has a strong
interest in managing and supervising its employees as
they do their jobs.  That managerial interest extends
even to the thousands of agents, investigators,
technicians, and other employees who -- across the
government who are expected, as part of their job
responsibilities, to testify in court.
In our view, when government employees
testify, they sometimes speak as citizens and they
sometimes speak as employees.  We agree that Petitioner
here spoke as a citizen when he testified, but we
disagree with the suggestion of some of the amici that
government employees always speak as citizens rather
than as --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  What's an example of
a subpoena that requires the employee to testify, but
that he's not testifying on public matters?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I think the
example would be a police officer executing a warrant.
We think the subpoena isn't really the right test.
There are times when --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But my hypothetical is
there is a subpoena, you are required to testify.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  I think, Your Honor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then you've -- you
indicate that there are some matters on which the
employee is not -- not protected.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, we think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is an example of
that?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  We think that, for
example, a police officer whose job it is to investigate
and testify about what he saw to support a warrant or
something like that would be a situation which he could
be subpoenaed by -- by the defense to testify, for
example, and it would still be part of his job
responsibilities.  The fact of the subpoena doesn't
change that a technician or an officer or an
investigator may be called to testify as part of his
duties.  I take --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you could fire
him because he testified?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, there is a
range of discipline -- disciplinary activities that
would be available to employees.  I think what Garcetti
says --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I still can't get the
hypothetical.  What -- what am I --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I just can't imagine
a case that's not -- not a matter of public interest.
Now, I can assume that if -- if the employee indicates
that he was dishonest or if he indicates that he's
clearly incompetent, some of the hypotheticals given in
the early argument, I understand that.  But so far as
the subject matter, it's the subject matter is of public
concern.  Necessarily, if it's a subpoena, is it not, or
am I wrong?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  No.  Your Honor, we would
say that in a criminal case -- I want to distinguish
between the public concern aspect of the test and then
the citizen employee aspect.  Because they really are
distinct.  In a criminal case if you are subpoenaed, we
would say that you are testifying on a matter of public
concern.  But that's not the same question as whether
you're testifying as a citizen or as an employee, which
is exactly what this Court addressed in Garcetti.  We do
think that Petitioner, someone who was not regularly
expected to testify in court as part of his government
responsibilities, would be testifying as a citizen on a
matter of public concern.
However, there will be situations, and the
government has thousands of people whose job it is to
investigate, who are records custodians, sometimes even
testify on a 30(b)(6) on behalf of the government,
they're actually speaking for the government, who could
be called by subpoena, who would then be testifying as
employees even though their speech is on a matter of
public.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if the
subpoena is not to the government and if the subpoena is
just to the particular person?  What are the -- what's
the context in which that person should not receive a
minimum of protection subject to Pickering balancing,
but that that should be -- why not consider that
protected?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, because that's
exactly what the Court held in Garcetti.  The government
shouldn't be disabled from being able to judge and
evaluate the -- the performance of its employees.  For
example, the employee may show a lack of judgment; the
employee may be belligerent.  Juries may not be
believing this --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that was Justice Kagan's
qualification.  That's the Pickering balance.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, but this is --
that is, I think what we would -- that's what the -- the
ACLU amicus urges, and we strongly urge the Court not to
do that.  That argument was available in Garcetti, as
well.  It's always available to say, just take this at
step two of the balance, but that would --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, wait a minute.
What are you doing about the truth-finding functions of
the -- of a trial setting when you're saying or telling
people, employees, don't go and tell the truth because
if the truth hurts your employer, you're going to be
fired?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, there is a --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That there's
something -- you can be always fired for some other
reason that the employer can point to under Pickering or
otherwise, but what kind of message are we giving when
we're telling employees, you're subpoenaed for any reason in
a trial, go and tell a falsehood because otherwise you
can be fired?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, if it's actual
instruction to do a falsehood, there's a range of
protections that the government -- that -- that are
available.  There are whistleblower -- there are
whistleblower statutes, Federal prosecution --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You mean the
Constitution doesn't protect someone in a trial from
telling the truth?  That it's not a matter of public
concern that an employee tell the truth?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, it is a matter
of public concern.  But we think it's the same as in
Garcetti.  What was at issue in Garcetti was a false
affidavit to the Court to support a warrant.  And what
this Court says -- what it said was it was part of the
employee's job to -- to investigate.  And in that
situation he was acting on behalf of the government.
Now, we would say that you don't have to
reach this question, but we urge the Court not to hold
what the ACLU -- and I gather Petitioner is -- is
stepping back from here -- a broad rule saying that any
time an employee testifies in court, it is automatically
speech as a citizen, as distinct from on a matter of
public concern.  We think that that would really intrude
on the government's ability to -- to supervise its
employees who are testifying.  As I say, there may be
lack of candor, there may be belligerent -- belligerency
and things like that that the government has to be able
to -- to react to and rely on whistleblower statutes and
criminal prosecutions and First Amendment protections in
true whistleblowing context for -- to provide protection
for the -- for -- for employees.
If I could just touch briefly on the
qualified immunity.  We do not think that this case
should be sent back.  We think -- we agree with the
Chief Justice and Justice Sotomayor that the Eleventh
Circuit decision was sufficiently clear that an employee
could not be said to have been either plainly
incompetent or intentionally violating the law when it
relied on that Eleventh Circuit precedent --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Gershengorn, could
I ask the question that I tried and failed to ask
Mr. Singh?  Because Justice Breyer is, of course,
completely right.  This footnote 2 doesn't really answer
the question.  It answers it on a hypothesis that the
constitutional issue came out in a certain way, and then
it said, a fortiori there is
immunity.  So it didn't really -- if there was a
different decision as to the constitutional question, it
didn't answer the question of qualified immunity.  And,
of course, it's Eleventh Circuit law.  Why would we be
deciding it.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, we don't think
that you should send it back precisely because three
judges -- for several reasons, but among them, that
three judges below read their own precedent to say that
this was not unconstitutional.  We think in the
qualified immunity context, what this Court has said is
that a reasonable official should not be penalized for
picking the losing side of a judicial controversy.  The
Eleventh Circuit construed its -- its own precedent to
authorize or at least not make unconstitutional this
action.  And that is enough.  Under this Court's
precedents, an employee should be able to look to the
precedent of his own court, of his own circuit,
particularly when what that court is doing is not
interpreting something for the first time, but
construing its own precedent.
Mr. Chief Justice, you asked if there were
other cases.  We think Morris v. Crow is enough.  But we
also think that Green v. Barrett, which is the only
post-Garcetti case, and it's cited in both of the red
briefs, is even a stronger precedent and actually
reinforces everything that was at issue in Morris v.
Crow.  In Green v. Barrett, that was testimony at a
court hearing.  And I think the rule coming out of the
Eleventh Circuit, which a reasonable employee could have
relied on, was that testimony, when the motive is to
comply with the subpoena and the subject matter was
related to information you learned on your job, that was
not protected even if it's presented in the course of a
civil deposition or if it's presented at a court
hearing.
And so Your Honor, we really don't think
there is any need to -- to send this case back.  We
don't think that Groh or Hope are cases that are
reasonably helpful to -- to Petitioner here, because
those are cases in which the courts of appeals actually
decided the constitutional question against the
Petitioner.  Now, they did find qualified immunity and
this Court reversed.  But it would be very unusual and I
think unprecedented in this Court's history to find a
situation in which the court of appeals actually found
no Constitutional violation and yet this Court denied
qualified immunity.  So we don't think there is any need
to send it back.
If there are no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
General Strange.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. LUTHER J. STRANGE, III
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BURROW
MR. STRANGE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
As attorney general, I stand here before you
with a particular interest, a keen interest really, in
the situations that both the public employees in this
case find themselves:  Mr. Lane, who we argue is
entitled to First Amendment protection because he was
talking about a matter as a citizen, a matter of public
concern; and Mr. Franks, who we believe is entitled to
rely on sovereign -- I mean, qualified immunity because
he was relying on the precedent of this circuit and with
the law in this area was not clearly established.
As attorney general, I get to supervise
these people every day and we depend on people like
Mr. Lane or people who find themselves in that
situation, who are willing to and need to be able to
testify in cases involving public corruption.  And the
case at the heart -- the situation at the heart of this
case was one of the most egregious public corruption
situations in Alabama's history.  It led to a total
rewrite of our public corruption laws and our ethics
laws.  And if we can't depend on people like Mr. Lane or
people in a situation like Mr. Lane to feel free to
testify as citizens on matters of public concern --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why should it matter
then if an employee's job is to investigate corruption?
If that's their job and they are called by you to
testify at a corruption trial and then they are fired
for it, should it really matter that it's part of their
job or not?
MR. STRANGE:  Your Honor, I think it should.
And I think the -- as we point out in our brief, I think
the Court has the right rule and the right test in
Garcetti, because the Court clearly recognized there are
a group of employees who are paid by money appropriated
by the government to do jobs exactly like you described,
to investigate cases.  Child welfare caseworkers and so
forth, they are in a category that has a less -- we've
already made the decision, the Court has, that they have
not the entire free speech rights that the First
Amendment allows to employees.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that seems
counterintuitive to me.  Why do we let -- why do we put
people at risk for telling the truth?
MR. WAGGONER:  Well, I wouldn't characterize
it --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  To tell the truth about
something?  And I'm assuming if they lie, they can be
fired.  But why are we --
MR. STRANGE:  Well, I agree with my
colleague from the Department of Justice.  There are
very -- lots of legitimate reasons that a court -- I
think in Garcetti, the Court acknowledged this, that why
the government has to supervise, has to take a look at
the overall --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Look, I certainly understand
people -- government being able to tell people don't
go out and talk to the newspapers about this, don't go
out and talk about X publicly, because we should be able
to control those kinds of disclosures.  But why are we
putting people at risk for doing -- telling fundamental
truth in a public forum like a trial?
MR. STRANGE:  Well, I think certainly as the
top prosecutor in the State of Alabama, I expect and
insist the value of the testimony is that they are
telling the truth.
The question I guess is, are they at risk
for doing that?  And I think in -- a public employee in
the category of Mr. Lane, they shouldn't be.  I think
they are protected under the First Amendment because
they are speaking as citizens on matters of public
concern.  Police officers, child welfare folks, we
expect them to tell the truth, too, but they are in a
slightly different category.  And as my colleague from
DOJ said, they have other protections.  And I hope in
Alabama they get a medal for telling the truth, however
the truth comes out.
But I'd like to get to one thing that I think
helps settle some -- a number of these issues, and
that's what we say in our brief, which is the core
holding of the Garcetti test.  And maybe it will
clarify.  We think it will answer most of these
questions as they arise.  And the fundamental test is
this, as we say in our brief:  Whether the employee's
job duties encompassed the speech in question.  That's
not an exact test, but it's a test that certainly in our
view protects Mr. Lane in this situation.  He was a
director of a program for at-risk youth.  He wasn't
anticipated or expected to testify in any forum.
Certainly he is knowledgeable about his job and what
happened there.  He was a valuable witness in this case.
Let me switch over to the question of
qualified immunity, because I take a slightly different
position.  There, I think that people in Mr. Franks's
position, people who have to supervise employees, are
entitled to rely on the law of their circuit.  Because I
agree with, I think, the Chief Justice, we can't expect
employees who have to make decisions all the time to be
aware of what's going on in other circuits and so forth.
We don't think the Eleventh Circuit got it right.  We
think if they had applied the test that I just
articulated, the core, they would have come out possibly
differently.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what about the
Martinez case?  I mean, Morris talks about it in a way
that suggests that it's quite different.  And it seems
closer to the Petitioner's situation than Morris.
MR. STRANGE:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you
know, I think if you're in Franks's position or if you
have employees like that, there may be reasonable
variables -- maybe that case had made sense.  Maybe the
Morris case made sense.  What I think happens, I think
the Eleventh Circuit looked at its previous -- they
picked the Morris case.  They looked at their previous
precedent, and they thought what the Court had said in
Martinez -- I mean in -- I'm sorry, in Garcetti,
applied.  They went further than Garcetti did.  They
talked about testimony.  They went beyond Garcetti.
They thought it was reasonable in what they had said
before and they made this decision.  And I think Franks
has got to be able to rely on that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think if
every other circuit has come out the other way and you
have what -- well, let's take the dictum.  There is an
Eleventh Circuit case that, it's dictum.  Are the
employees supposed to -- are they protected by following
that, or do they have to follow the consensus in the
other circuits?
MR. STRANGE:  I think they are protected,
Your Honor, if they rely on the law of their circuit
unless the law is clearly established by this Court.
For example, I can't picture a situation where the
Eleventh Circuit -- and that's not this situation,
because I think the Eleventh Circuit made its
determination based on language that it felt like it
could hang its hat on in Garcetti.  We think that was
wrong, but I don't think it's so unreasonable that they
couldn't rely on it.
And if it's something that's reasonable for
the Court to rely on even though there's a split in the
circuits, I don't think it's clearly established, in
which case I think a person who is trying in good faith
to, you know, manage his government employees to rely
on.
Well, if there are no further questions,
thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.
Mr. Waggoner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. WAGGONER
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FRANKS
MR. WAGGONER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Court should affirm the Eleventh
Circuit's decision on the First Amendment issue.  But
regardless of how it rules, we agree with the United
States and the State of Alabama that Dr. Franks is still
entitled to qualified immunity from damages in his
individual capacity in this case.
There is no reason for the Court to depart
from its precedent, primarily in the Garcetti decision,
to affirm the Eleventh Circuit.  The issuance of a
subpoena, the Court has already rejected in Garcetti
that the forum of speech is determinative.  So we do not
believe that the issuance of a subpoena in and of itself
entitles a speaker to protection of the First Amendment.
It is the character of the speech, rather,
that -- that has to be looked at to determine whether
the speech is -- is protected under the First Amendment.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Garcetti turned on what
were -- what were the job duties of the particular
person, and there the job duty was to investigate.  Here,
the distinction is, everybody agrees, that it's not part
of the job description of Lane.
MR. WAGGONER:  Yes, Your Honor.  In
Garcetti, the Court declined to set out a comprehensive
framework for defining of an employee's job duties when
there is room for serious debate.  That is why, in this
case, we have suggested to the Court that it adopt the
framework that we have set out that was originally
articulated in Garcetti about whether there is a citizen
analog for the speech.
The Eleventh Circuit in this case held that
it was not distinctly one of the job duties of Mr. Lane
to testify; however, his testimony was inseparable from
his job duties, and we do believe that when he
testified, that it was pursuant to his official duties.
There is a gap in -- in Garcetti about
the -- the definition where the Court declined to set
out a comprehensive framework where there is room for
debate.  And that's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I still don't
understand or didn't understand what it is you're
saying.  If he testifies, and you don't -- you want to
keep the corruption secret.  You know, you don't want to
reveal it and he testifies truthfully and reveals it.
Can he be disciplined for that?
MR. WAGGONER:  Your Honor, under the citizen
analog test or inquiry that the Court began to
articulate in Garcetti, if the testimony is factual,
based solely on the job duties, as it was here,
inseparable from the job duties, and it is information
that a citizen would not know, that only the testifier
would know, then that is not protected speech under
Garcetti.
It's not the subpoena, and it's not
because it's testimony.  It is the character of the
speech and whether a --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what is he --
what is he supposed to do?  I mean, he gets a subpoena,
and the -- the other side or somebody, this independent
counsel, says, you know, what's going on?  What do you
know about, you know, from your job responsibilities?
What happened or did you -- is this person taking money?
Is this person showing up?  What's he supposed to do?
He says, gosh, if I -- if I answer, I'm
going to lose my job or could, and if I don't or answer
falsely -- the Fifth Amendment protects him from
incriminating himself.  It doesn't protect the
department he works for from being incriminated.
MR. WAGGONER:  Mr. Chief Justice, we would
never suggest that anybody not comply with a subpoena,
comply with an investigation, or testify truthfully.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you are
suggesting he can be fired if he does it.
MR. WAGGONER:  If -- if it does not offend
the First Amendment, and we believe that's why we're
here.  We're talking about the Garcetti precedent and
whether the free speech under the First Amendment clause
to the Constitution is implicated.  And as this Court
said --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is Garcetti right on
that point as it relates to testimony?  That -- that's
really the issue that's of public concern.  Is Garcetti
right?  Is the line between it being a part of your
duties or not sensical in any way?
MR. WAGGONER:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We've all agreed that
getting fired for admitting something, doing it in -- in
an improper way, a whole host of things can get you
fired.  But if someone is called to testify truthfully
about a matter of public concern, and they testify that
way, should they be able to be fired under the First
Amendment?
MR. WAGGONER:  Only, Your Honor, if the --
well, of course, as the Court observed in Garcetti,
there's a powerful network of legislative enactments
that -- that prohibit retaliating against an employee or
penalizing an employee for testifying truthfully.
Certainly, witness tampering laws,
obstruction of justice laws, whistleblower laws, Section
1985, which Mr. Lane originally had a count in his
complaint under, but we do believe that under Garcetti,
you have to first look at whether the employee is
speaking as a citizen.
The Petitioner and some of the -- the other
parties here conflate the citizen analysis that the
Court articulated in Garcetti and the public concern
analysis.  Of course, this was a matter of public
concern, this trial that Mr. Lane testified in.  But you
have to look at, as -- again, as you held in Garcetti,
that whether or not there was speech by a citizen.  And
you have to look at those two --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But are you suggesting that
when somebody learns something from his job, that that
means it's not speech by a citizen?
MR. WAGGONER:  Only if -- it depends on the
speech that -- that follows from knowing something on
your job.  The Court has long articulated speech that is
close to the heart of the First Amendment, whether it is
opinion speech, whether it is engaging in public debate,
whether public dialogue, expressing viewpoints,
criticizing the government, criticizing superiors.  But
factual testimony based only on knowledge that an
employee has pursuant to their official duties would not
be protected speech because of the character of the
speech and because that information is only gathered as
part of their official duties.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if that -- what if the
same information -- what if the employee writes a
newspaper article or gives an interview and reveals the
same information?  Would that be subject to Pickering?
MR. WAGGONER:  Well, it depends on the
character of the speech, Your Honor.  And if --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if it's about
corruption in my government?  In the place where I work,
there are a lot of no-show jobs, and so the person
writes an article that says that.  Is that a matter
of --
MR. WAGGONER:  That sounds like -- that
sounds like protected speech, as in Pickering, Your
Honor.  That's a -- the classic example of an employee
writing a letter to the editor criticizing the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but when he's using
factual matter that he only knows because he's an
employee in a particular branch of government.
MR. WAGGONER:  Then that would not be
protected speech.  It's not the forum -- under Garcetti,
it's not the forum that is dispositive.  It's the
character of the speech and whether speaking as an
employee and whether just relaying information that the
employee possesses pursuant to their official duties.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you say it's
protected, does that -- you mean under the -- it
qualifies under the first step in Garcetti.  It doesn't
mean that he can't be disciplined under the Pickering
analysis that follows that.
MR. WAGGONER:  Well, if it's not citizen
speech under Garcetti, then you don't get to public
concern, and then you don't get to Pickering balancing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But even if
it is, you could say that it is -- when you say it's
protected, you mean that just it gets to the Pickering
analysis, not that -- not that the employee is --
MR. WAGGONER:  Correct.  It meets the
speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So your -- your position is
you cannot speak as a citizen if -- if your speech
consists of disclosing material that you knew as an
employee.  Why is that true?
MR. WAGGONER:  Your Honor, because, as in --
as in Garcetti, where the Court said that when you're
speaking pursuant to official job duties --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but this is not an
official job duty.  It's just a matter that I know of
because of my job.  Why does that mean that when I
disclose that, I am not speaking as a citizen?
MR. WAGGONER:  Yes, Your Honor.  It would
also depend on the speech itself and the character of
the speech.  If -- if you engage in opinion testimony,
writing letters to the editor, then --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I'm just --
MR. WAGGONER:  -- the possibility of a --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm just talking about
facts, no opinions, just facts.  But I learned those
facts on the job as an employee, and I -- is it your
position that whenever you are reciting those facts, you
cannot be speaking as a citizen?
MR. WAGGONER:  That would not be protected
speech, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But then, I mean, we've said
several times things like this:  Government employees
are often in the best position to know what ails the
agencies for which they work.  In other words, expecting
that people will know things because they work in a
place and that they can take what they know as a result
of working in a place and go out and be a citizen.
MR. WAGGONER:  And that is certainly true,
Your Honor.
And when an employee, as in Pickering, takes
that knowledge that they have gained in their public
employment and engages in the speech, type of speech,
that is close to the heart of the First Amendment when
you're engaging in public debate addressing --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in Pickering it was
something that anybody could know.  It didn't depend
upon the job, learning on the job.  I thought in
Pickering the --
MR. WAGGONER:  Some --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- any citizen could have
known that information.  Here, the knowledge comes only
because of the public employment.
MR. WAGGONER:  Yes, Your Honor.  In
Pickering, I believe some of the -- some of the
information was certainly subject to public knowledge.
And Your Honor is right that here the testimony given by
Mr. Lane was inseparable from his job duties.  It was --
it was knowledge that he gained by his interactions with
his subordinate employee discussing with her the terms
and conditions of her employment, and he merely -- as
the United States observed, he merely relayed that
information in -- in the -- in the trial.
But because he was not expressing
viewpoints, engaging in opinion testimony, the -- the
forum of -- of the -- the trial did not endow that
speech which -- with constitutional protection.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me make sure I
understand what you're saying.  Two employees know that
there is someone who has a no shot -- no-show job where
they work.  One of them writes a letter to the editor
and says:  John Doe has a no-show job.  One of them
testifies pursuant to subpoena in a criminal trial:
John Doe has a no-show job.
Is -- is it your view that Pickering does
not apply in either of those situations, or it applies
in -- in the latter but not in the former?
MR. WAGGONER:  Pickering does not apply.
The Pickering balancing does not apply in either of
those situations.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Neither one.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Really?  Well, let's
say it's -- his job is to investigate corruption in the
agency.  And he writes a letter saying:  Here's all -- I
have these, you know, facts; here's all this corruption
in the agency, and -- and he writes it to the -- a
letter to the editor.  Surely he can be disciplined for
that.  I mean, let's say the -- his superiors were not
ready to call off the investigation at that point.
MR. WAGGONER:  If his letter to the editor
merely relayed factual testimony that he possessed only
pursuant to his official job duties, that would not be
protected speech.
Now, in the letter to the editor, certainly
like in Pickering, where the -- the employee goes beyond
that and expresses views, criticizes the school board,
and that sort of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where -- where -- where did
you get this notion that the First Amendment only
applies to the expression of views and not to the
conveyance of -- of facts?
MR. WAGGONER:  So we --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All of us can be protected
from knowing certain facts and that would not violate
the First Amendment?
MR. WAGGONER:  Yes, Your Honor.  We believe
that that test is -- at least was begun to be
articulated in Garcetti, where the Court said that where
speech has no relevant citizen analog, that it is not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the government --
MR. WAGGONER:  -- protected speech.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- can presumably prohibit
anybody teaching, what, economics, the facts of -- of
economics?
MR. WAGGONER:  No, Your Honor.  And I -- I
believe --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The facts of World War II.
MR. WAGGONER:  No, Your Honor.  We -- I --
we are talking about a -- a -- in a different context.
I know --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know where you get
it from.  I've never heard of this distinction, the
First Amendment protects only opinions and not facts.
I've never heard of it.
MR. WAGGONER:  Well, Your Honor, we believe
that it's -- it's a long-time precedent of this Court
that speech, certainly in the Hustler, Falwell v.
Hustler case, where it talked about speech that is close
to the heart of the First Amendment, expressing
viewpoints, engaging in opinion, public debate, that
that is certainly protected speech.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought it
was just because the facts came from your employment.
If you're conducting an investigation and you find out
that, you know, so-and-so is taking a bribe because
that's your job, I don't know that you have a First
Amendment right to go out and say that, when, for
example, your superior would say, oh, we are about to
set up a sting operation, we are going to get the -- the
goods on her.  And you say, well, I think I'd rather
write a letter to the editor saying that she -- she has
been caught, you know, taking a bribe.
MR. WAGGONER:  Well, Your Honor, we are
saying that speech would not be protected if it is
merely relaying information that an employee has
pursuant to their official duties and when that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that wouldn't make
any difference whether it was fact, opinion, views.  I
thought your distinction was -- was clear.  You are
saying if you learn the information on the job, then
you're not protected, and it doesn't matter whether it's
opinion, expression, as long as what you were speaking
about is something that you've learned on the job.  I
thought that was your position.
MR. WAGGONER:  I -- maybe I should clarify,
Your Honor.
It -- it is our position that if it is
information that is learned on the job and is not
relayed in just a factual context and it -- and it goes
into that speech that is closer to the heart of the
First Amendment, then it would be protected speech, Your
Honor.
If it was the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Give me an example of
an opinion that would be protected First Amendment
speech, as you said, and yet is based on facts you
learned only because of your public employment.
MR. WAGGONER:  Your Honor, I would -- I
would suggest something close to the Pickering fact
situation where a letter to the editor was written that
in -- that contained opinion speech, debate speech,
critical speech.  And assuming that that was based
solely on information that the employee had pursuant to
their official duties, then that would be protected
speech.
I think the -- under the citizen analogue
analysis, there is a pretty limited range of speech that
would not be protected.  But it would apply here, where
Mr. Lane testified pursuant to his -- his official
duties and relayed information that he only had because
of his interactions with Miss Schmitz and it was -- and
it was solely factual testimony, that that is not
protected speech, even though a subpoena was issued
because, as the Court said in Garcetti, the forum is not
dispositive.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if I could just
understand what you're saying.  Are -- are you saying
that, no matter what the employee's official duties are,
as long as he gets information because he is a public
employee and he is in a workplace, that that's what
matters?
I mean, I know all kinds of things about a
workplace that go beyond exactly what my official
responsibilities are.  So if I communicate things that I
learn in a workplace, but, you know, I have nothing to
do with prosecuting corruption or with investigating
corruption, do I count as an employee, or do I not count
as an employee in that context?
MR. WAGGONER:  I think the question there,
Your Honor, as the Court articulated in Garcetti, is
it -- is it pursuant to your official job duties?  For
example, in this case, Mr. Lane, his official duties
were to manage and hire and fire his subordinate
employees, in this case, Miss Schmitz.  So he was
acting -- and nobody -- nobody here disputes that he was
acting pursuant to his official duties when he did that.
And because he -- he testified solely to those facts,
his testimony in Court was inseparable from those job
duties, then his speech was not protected.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Singh, you have 5 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TEJINDER SINGH.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SINGH:  Thank you.  I'd like to begin,
if I might, by just talking about the subject of
qualified immunity and the import of the Eleventh
Circuit and what it did and didn't decide.
The Eleventh Circuit clearly has decided
that in 2009, when Petitioner was fired, the law has not
clearly established a right to testify in the Eleventh
Circuit.  That was decided in this case and so I think
there is no point to remanding it.  Nothing about this
Court's decision in 2014 is going to change the Eleventh
Circuit's belief about what the law was in 2009.  And so
I think you should decide the question.  On that issue,
I think it's very telling that both of the sovereigns in
this case say that we win under a straightforward
application of Garcetti cited in 2006.  You look at
Respondent Burrow's brief and repeatedly she urges,
don't make a new rule of law; just apply the rule of law
you had in Garcetti.  The United States makes the same
argument.  Page 16 of its brief argues that, "The
holding of Garcetti was especially clear about the
factors a Court should consider in deciding whether an
employee testified pursuant to his responsibilities."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the Eleventh
Circuit really got it wrong.
MR. SINGH:  Absolutely, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it's still the
precedent that governs in this situation unless you're
going to have the employees analyze the law in the other
circuits or unless you're going to have the employees
look at the Eleventh Circuit opinion and say, I know
that's what it says, but it's wrong.
MR. SINGH:  Your Honor, I think if Supreme
Court precedent is clear, then contrary to Eleventh
Circuit precedent shouldn't be controlling and employees
shouldn't be entitled to rely on it, and that's
certainly the implication of what this Court said in
Hope v. Pelzer.  In Hope v. Pelzer, one of the arguments
that the defendants made was that there were a variety
of district court decisions that supported their view of
the law.  And this Court said that the import of
judicial precedent is a function of the judicial
hierarchy.  And when, as here, Supreme Court precedent
sets the rules, Eleventh Circuit precedent can't supply
a contrary rule.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're requiring
the government employee in this case to be a better
analyzer of Supreme Court precedent than the three
Eleventh Circuit judges.
MR. SINGH:  Your Honor, I think that that is
not what we're requiring, because our argument in this
case is supplemented by what I think is an equally
strong argument that Eleventh Circuit precedent really
did not support this outcome, that the Court went very,
very far out on a limb in this case.
And I might just talk about the one case
that the Solicitor General mentioned, the Green v.
Barrett case.  This is an unpublished case issued in
2007 in which the chief jailer of a jail attended a
hearing at a court, and it's not even 100 percent clear
why this hearing was at a court.  It was an emergency
hearing convened to decide whether a particular prison
over which the jailer had responsibility was a safe
place to keep a particularly dangerous inmate.  And she
was fired after that testimony.
There is no indication that it was even a
public hearing.  There's no indication that it was the
sort of judicial proceedings we're talking about here.
And I think when you compare that case, again, to the
precedential decision in Martinez in 1992, no one could
have looked at those cases and come to the conclusion
that it's really a good idea for a State employer to
fire a Federal witness in retaliation for their truthful
testimony.
That's the conclusion that Franks would have
had to be able to reach in 2009.  You would have had to
examine the body of this Court's precedents, which
consistently have held that even knowledge gained in the
course of employment is subject to First Amendment
protection.  That's been the rule in Mr. Pickering's
case, where he talked about how his work at the high
school was the reason he knew that certain statements
were false.  It was the case in the Mount Healthy case
where all a teacher did was disclose a memorandum, an
internal memorandum, to a radio station.  That's been
established since the 1960s.  And there was nothing that
Franks could have looked to or pointed to in 2009 that
would have said firing somebody in retaliation for
truthful testimony in a Federal corruption trial is
permissible.  Thank you.
If there are no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the
