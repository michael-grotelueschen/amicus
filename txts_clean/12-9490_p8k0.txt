CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
in Case 12-9490, Navarette v. California.
Mr. Kleven.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. KLEVEN,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS,
APPOINTED BY THIS COURT
MR. KLEVEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In this case, the Court should hold that
officers acting on anonymous tips must corroborate the
tips' assertions of illegal conduct, as well as the
identifying details before making a stop, whether that
tip involves erratic driving, illegal gun possession, or
any other allegation of misconduct.
Now, the State proposes that the reasonable
suspicion rule in-- established in Terry v. Ohio, which
courts and law enforcement officials have been applying
now for more than 40 years, should be altered so that,
now, it applies as a sliding scale where the level of
suspicion varies depending on the nature of the crime
that an anonymous tipster claims someone has committed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if the tip -- so
if the tip is, is this car is driving by and throwing
bombs out the window, okay, every -- you know, whatever,
500 yards, the police find the car, they have to wait
until they see the person actually throw a bomb out the
window themselves, before pulling them over?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, Your Honor, in terms of
the reasonable suspicion, yes.  If there -- if all they
have is an anonymous tip and there is no -- they have no
way of corroborating any of the -- any of the innocent
details, except that they can identify the car, then,
yes, under --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your answer is
yes, the car is going there, and he's throwing a bomb
out, and it goes off, but he has to wait till he sees
them throw out another bomb?
MR. KLEVEN:  Your Honor, under the
Florida-J.L., the Court has said that when they are
looking -- when all that they are able to corroborate
are obvious reasonably observable details, such as that,
then there is no basis for the Court to go beyond
that -- and
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that -- that
J.L. gave an example of an exception that the report is
somebody is carrying a bomb?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, there is that exception,
Your Honor.  And in Florida-J.L, it said that it was
not -- the Court said that it was not required on the
facts of that case to speculate about a situation where
such a serious danger --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Throwing bombs doesn't
count, but carrying a bomb does, is that it?  Were they
throwing bombs that they weren't carrying?
MR. KLEVEN:  Your Honor, that would not make
a difference.  However, in this case, in terms of
adjusting the reasonable suspicion standard, the Court
should not address that.  The Court has never said --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Excuse me.  I'm sorry.
Could I ask you what you mean by an "anonymous tip"?
Suppose somebody calls up 911 and gives a name?  Does
that make it not an anonymous tip?
MR. KLEVEN:  Your Honor, technically, it
would not be, but in the circumstances here, I think it
should be treated as an anonymous tip because, again,
the name could be false when the tip first comes in.  If
it's corroborated in some way, then --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how would you
corroborate it?  Let's say the person calls up and gives
a name and gives an address?  So what would be
necessary?  What would the police have to do then before
they could stop the vehicle, other than observing the
vehicle do something illegal?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well again, if all they have is an
assertion by the -- by the tipster that this is the name
and the address, and if the officers can somehow, again,
by caller identification or some other method verify
that, in fact, that is the person so that, somewhere
down the line, that person will be -- will be held
accountable for a false tip, then it can be treated
differently.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what if you
have caller ID.  I mean, you have one of these anonymous
flip phones, right?  You can buy them, it's prepaid.
You call up and say, I'm -- you know, John Smith, I've
seen this, and they look, there's the caller, there's
the number.
Then they can do it.
MR. KLEVEN:  No, Your Honor.  That would not-- If all they
have is a number, then they are not going to be able to
use that as a basis for --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, isn't that all
caller ID gives you?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, with caller ID, if they
are somehow able to verify, not just that this is coming
from this phone, but that, in fact, there's a particular
person there, if they can identify the location, that
sort of thing.  As the -- as the tip gets more and more
like the known informant in the Adams case, then the court--
officers can take more solace in the fact that that
person is going to be able to be held responsible.
In Adams, of course, there's a situation
where there is a known informant who can be arrested
immediately if, in fact, the tip turns out to be false.
The problem with so many of these cases, with the 911
tape -- 911 caller, is that even if -- is that there's
not going to be any sort of accountability even if they
do manage to identify the person in terms of showing the
tip is false where the allegation, for example, is
weaving.
There's no way to prove that that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  If we transport the standard
that applies outside of the vehicle context to this
context, what would happen in this situation?  A person
calls up and says, this is my name, this is my address
and it's -- it's not blocked by caller ID, so the 911
operator can see that that's the name, that's the
address.
The person says, this guy ran me off the
road.  The police find the vehicle.  They drive behind
the vehicle for a while.  They don't -- they don't see
any -- they don't see any violation.  So then they
think, well, this guy must have lied.
So are they going to prosecute the guy for
calling -- calling that in?
MR. KLEVEN:  No, Your Honor, because still
they wouldn't be able to prosecute them because the fact
that the vehicle is now not weaving doesn't show that
they were -- that it was or was not weaving --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, your argument goes
well beyond.  You're saying this has to do with
anonymous tips, but it really goes well beyond anonymous
tips.  It covers tips where you know exactly who called
in, and what you're saying is that they really can never
stop a vehicle no matter what kind of a tip they get,
unless they see the vehicle committing an illegal act.
That's the argument.
MR. KLEVEN:  No, Your Honor.  I'm sorry.
No, I don't think it goes that far, Your Honor.  I think
as the tip becomes -- as the tip contains more detail
and as the tipster becomes more accountable for a false
tip, again, getting more over toward the Adams v.
Kennedy, then, at some point, the anonymous tip would be
or that the tip --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, give me an example of a
situation in which the police can pull somebody over
after receiving a tip without actually seeing the
vehicle commit an illegal act?
MR. KLEVEN:  I think, Your Honor, in a
situation where the caller calls in, says I'm -- I've
been -- this car is driving erratically.  The caller
then says, I'm following the car.  Now, we're at
such-and-such a location.  The vehicle has just done
something else that's wrong.
And they continue to follow up to the point
where, okay, I can now see the -- the patrol car coming
up, again, where the tipster is putting his or her
credibility on the line and becomes more and more
accountable towards the Adams v. Kennedy known
informant, then if you add that together under the
totality of the circumstances, then you will have a
situation probably to do it.
I think it's going to be rare, and I think
it should be rare because it is so easy -- as the Court
has indicated, the Court has shown skepticism for
anonymous tips because the tipsters are able to harass
other people without running any risk of being held
accountable.
And it should be particularly skeptical in
the case of anonymous tips about erratic driving
because, with the ubiquitous cell phones, it's so easy
for somebody who's on the road, who's been annoyed by
somebody else, to just pull out the cell phone and call
in a false tip.
And so --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do we have any
indication that this is a serious problem?  The false
tips?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, there's no empirical
evidence in the record.  However, it was the same
concern that led the Court, in J.L., to refuse to adopt
the firearm exception, the concern that making it so
easy for people to subject others to the harassment of
a -- of a stop and -- and potential -- potential search
concerned the Court enough that it denied -- it refused
to adopt the firearm exception.
And in this case, we have a firearm
exception -- we have an exception that's being requested
that's doctrinally the same as a firearm exception.
There is-- there is no indication in the record that drunk
driving on its own, in totality, presents a more serious
threat to public safety than -- than firearms do.
In fact, it --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, is that -- is
that true?  I mean, how many people die from drunk
driving versus how many people dry--die from firearms?
MR. KLEVEN:  The most recent -- the most
recent statistics show a little more, about 11,000
people die from homicides by firearms, and it's usually
under 10,000 now that are driving -- dying by drunk
driving.
And in terms of public safety, approximately
two-thirds of the people who die as a result of drunk
driving are the drunk drivers themselves.  So, in fact,
the overall threat to public safety is not as great when
you're talking about drunk driving as -- as with
firearms.
And the Court indicated, in J.L., that it
was specifically concerned about the serious threat that
armed criminals pose to public safety, and, despite that
serious threat, they denied -- the Court denied the
firearms exception.
Now, what the -- excuse me.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was just going to
say, we have held that the -- the standards are loosened
in the vehicle context because your expectation of
privacy is diminished when you're out on the road
driving along in -- in a vehicle.  Does that have any
pertinence?
MR. KLEVEN:  I don't think so in this case,
Your Honor, because even though it's diminished as
opposed to, for example, in the home, it's -- in J.L.,
of course, the person was on a public sidewalk; the
person was not in the home.
And in -- in Prouse, the Court talked about
the fact that, in modern day times, people -- a lot of
people will feel more of a sense of security, they'll
feel more privacy in a vehicle than they would out on
the street.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But in the context in which
we've approved sobriety checkpoints, why should we get
bent out of shape over this?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, Your Honor, in the
sobriety checkpoint case, the Court has looked at the
intrusion and found that to be at the very rock bottom
in terms of intrusion, the fact that somebody is --
along with a number of other people, that they have to
submit to a brief stop, it has put that on the lowest --
on the lowest level.
And so it's a -- the Court has not approved
any situation where individual vehicles, as in this
case, are pulled over without reasonable suspicion that,
in fact, somebody in that vehicle is engaged in -- in
criminal activity.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but why is that an
important line?  Why should we be more concerned when an
individual automobile is pulled over?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, because the -- the
intrusion is greater, Your Honor.  And the
Martinez-Fuentes case and the Brignoni-Ponce case, the
Court talked about the very minimal intrusion of the
checkpoints, as opposed to -- and Prouse talks about
this also, that there is a serious intrusion when
somebody is pulled over.
You have the activation of the emergency
lights, you have a siren, you're pulled over, possibly,
in a neighborhood where -- where you're known and people
see it, possibly out in the middle of a road in the
middle of the night as in the -- the Wells case.  And in
either circumstance, it is a serious intrusion and one
that people are not going to take that lightly.  So
it's -- it's a different situation.
And the Court, again, if they're going to be
pulling over individual cars, signaling them out for --
for stops which could, under the Court's rules, again,
the driver, all the passengers can be ordered out of the
car if -- if the Terry standards are met.
They can --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  White suggested that we
don't have an absolute rule with respect to requiring
independent corroboration of the actual illegal conduct.
In White, the -- the tipster gave future predictive
information, but all of it was innocent, somebody
driving a car and going to a particular place.
Now, you're asking us to import that
wholesale.  Why don't we just stick to our general
standard, which is the totality of the circumstances,
and look at what failure there is in the logic of the
California court below.  It -- it looked at the quality
of the information regarding the vehicle, which is a
legitimate tipster will tell you what the vehicle looks
like and its license plate or enough information so it
can be identified.
It looked at the caller actually witnessing
the event and giving you enough detail to know that it's
not a legal conclusion, but an actual event that
suggests recklessness, and a corroboration of the -- of
the details given by the tipster.
Isn't that the application of our
traditional test?
MR. KLEVEN:  No, Your Honor.  And that's
exactly what the court was looking at in Florida J.L.--v. J.L.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's just not
true in Florida v. J.L. because the individual didn't
match the description completely, and there were two or
three individuals there, not just one, and so -- and
there was no predictive or no other detail, other than
someone in this general area.
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, there was no predictive
detail, but in J.L., the tip was young black male in a
plaid shirt at a bus stop.  Those details were
confirmed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Correct me if -- if I'm
wrong.  I might be missing something.  The tip in J.L.
was not a -- did not assert that a crime was being
committed, so there was something suspicious.  There was
no crime in possession of the gun.  Or correct me if I'm
wrong.
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, it was -- it was
Possession of the gun --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but here -- here,
there was -- the report was a crime.  Or is that not a
correct distinction?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, in -- in J.L., they
didn't say illegal gun possession, but presumably, the
tipster thought it was an illegal gun possession, and
the officer must have thought it was illegal gun
possession.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it was illegal.
MR. KLEVEN:  What?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It was illegal.
MR. KLEVEN:  Oh, it was because he turned
out to be under 21.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but the tip, in and
of itself, did not indicate that a crime was being
committed, which is different from this case.
MR. KLEVEN:  I'll agree that the tipster
didn't say it, but I think the assumption --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, I'm talking about an
interpretation of what the tip said.
MR. KLEVEN:  Well -- unless -- unless
the -- the implication is that the gun possession is
illegal, then there's no reason for the officer to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, a Terry stop.
MR. KLEVEN:  Hmm?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You might have had grounds
for a Terry stop.
MR. KLEVEN:  But if -- if the tip calls --
if the tips says, I'm looking at a case of gun
possession that, as far as I know, is perfectly legal,
it's like, in this case, if the tip came in and said,
I've just been passed by a car whose -- which was driven
very skillfully, there's no point in -- in pursuing the
tip in J.L., unless there's some -- some element of
illegality.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I think there's
a difference, but I think, for our purposes, we can
assume that the cases are comparable in that respect --
MR. KLEVEN:  Okay.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- but not comparable,
perhaps, in others.
MR. KLEVEN:  Okay.
Justice Sotomayor, going back to -- to
your concern, so in Florida v. J.L., those elements
were -- were confirmed and -- but the Court found that
the fact that those elements which could be observable
by anybody who was looking at the situation and probably
even more clearly an observation where the plaid shirt
was identified, that that didn't give any reason to
believe that the person was also being truthful in
talking about concealment.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No reason to believe the
caller had personal knowledge.
MR. KLEVEN:  Pardon me?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No reason to believe the
person had personal knowledge.
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, but personal knowledge --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He didn't say that the
gun was pulled on him or that -- or how he saw it or how
he knew.
MR. KLEVEN:  Right.  There was no indication
as to how the person knew about the gun.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you don't think
there's something significant about calling up and
saying, someone forced me off the road?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, there is something
significant, Your Honor.  But, by itself, that just
gives the officers some reason to go check and see
whether, in fact, there's a chance to corroborate.
In the case of an inebriated driver, the
fact that the driver is inebriated is concealed in the
same way that J.L.'s gun was, unless there's some sort
of erratic driving going on.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if there's no
way for the officer to corroborate the allegation?  You
know, you see -- see somebody on the street grab a young
child, throw her in the trunk of the car, and then take
off.
And somebody calls with an anonymous tip
saying, this fellow -- you know, in this car, has got a
child in the trunk.  The police can follow the person --
you know, for hours and they're not going to see any
corroborating evidence.
Can they pull that car over?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, Your Honor, if -- if
that's all they have to go on, then, under Florida v.
J.L., they would not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So just -- your
answer in that case is that the police cannot pull that
car over?
MR. KLEVEN:  If -- in terms of -- obviously,
it's a more serious situation, but the Court has not
held that the seriousness --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's expand
it a little bit.  It's a -- it's a one-lane -- two-lane
road going down, but it merges into -- you know, an
eight-lane expressway.  You have one police car.  It's
going to be hard for that police car to maintain
surveillance.  And you say they've just got to let them
go.
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, Your Honor, if you're
talking in terms of just the seriousness and you're
looking in terms of the Florida v. J.L. exception, the
Court seemed to be indicating, in that case, that there
would be a danger that was so extreme where the Court
would find a search or a stop justified without any
showing of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, just in terms
of your position, do you think they could pull the car
over?
MR. KLEVEN:  No, Your Honor.  I don't think
it would change.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Really?  Okay.
MR. KLEVEN:  Because, again, it's just
the -- the seriousness of the claim should not affect
whether there is, in fact, reasonable suspicion.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You get an A for
consistency.  I'm -- I'm not sure about common sense.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm -- I'm not sure he gets
an A for consistency.  I thought -- I thought you said
you acknowledged or didn't repudiate the statement in --
in our opinion in J.L., that, if there was a bomb in the
car, that would be something else.
What -- what if there's in the car -- the
tip is this person has an atomic bomb given him by Al
Qaeda; he is driving it into the center of Los Angeles
to -- to eradicate the entire city, okay?
Let it go?
MR. KLEVEN:  Your Honor, I believe --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He tells you the license
number, where the car is.  You can't stop the car?
MR. KLEVEN:  I believe, consistent with what
the court said in Florida v. J.L., that may be a
situation, again, where the Court decides that -- that
the risk is so great --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you see, he's not
consistent.  I mean --
MR. KLEVEN:  No, but it would not be -- it
should not change -- it should not be in terms of the
level of suspicion required under -- under Terry.  The
reasonable suspicion standard should not change on that.
The Court seemed to be indicating, in Florida v. J.L.,
that at some point, the level of danger becomes so great
that, in fact, there was --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the -- the atomic
bomb, the level of danger is great enough, but the young
girl in the trunk, the level of danger is not great
enough?
MR. KLEVEN:  Your Honor, what I'm saying, in
either of those situations, the Court may want to
consider some sort of exception to the reasonable
suspicion standard and that seems to be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is your position what
you would do if you were on this Court, with those
hypotheticals?  What is your position that should happen
in those two hypotheticals?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, Your Honor, I think that
the Court may well want to -- to craft some --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is your position as
to what the Court should do in those cases?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, let me start off by
saying, if I could, that I don't think the Court needs
to reach that question in this case, just as it did not
need to reach that question in J.L.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understand it, but we're
interested in a hypothetical.
MR. KLEVEN:  Right.  Your Honor, I believe
that, again, I don't know what particular doctrine the
Court would -- would choose, but I think that probably
the Court could find some -- some doctrine that would
allow it, in that circumstance, to find it.
But it shouldn't be -- it shouldn't be
moving toward the sliding scale element in -- that --
that we're talking about.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What about this:  In J.L.,
the Court made quite a point of saying, "An accurate
description of a subject's readily observable location
is reliable in a limited -- limited sense, namely,
identifying the person.  Such a tip, however, does not
show that the tipster has knowledge of concealed
criminal activity."
MR. KLEVEN:  That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Not concealed
here.
MR. KLEVEN:  I mean --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So that's an obvious
difference.  I mean, one case, it was concealed; this
case, it isn't concealed.  What do you say?
MR. KLEVEN:  Oh, but, except, Your Honor, that, in
fact, when we're talking about drunk driving, whether
the person is inebriated or not --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Didn't -- didn't the tip
here have something to do with his driving around in a
wild way -- or at least an unusual way?  I'm not sure I
would have followed him, if it had been me.  Anyway, you
see the point.
MR. KLEVEN:  Right.  But the question is,
Your Honor, is the person inebriated or not, to take
the -- the State's best example.  And that -- that
issue, that is a concealed element of criminal behavior,
unless the person is actually driving erratically.
If the person is driving erratically when
the officers appear, then there's no Fourth Amendment
issue, and it's clear that they have either reasonable
suspicion or probable cause to pull over the vehicle.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me you're
willing to accept our allowing -- or allowing the police
to stop the car with the atom bomb and even allowing the
police to stop the car with the kidnapped girl in the
trunk.
Once -- you know, once you give away those,
we're just arguing about details, where you draw the
line.  Does -- does drunken driving fall on one side or
the other of the line, and some of us may think drunken
driving is -- is pretty serious and probably -- you
know, as serious as having a kidnapped girl in the
trunk.
MR. KLEVEN:  And, Your Honor, I didn't mean
to concede that the Court should -- should reduce the
level of suspicion for reasonable suspicion in order to
do that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  More than that, I
want you to say the Court shouldn't.  Let the car go.
Bye-bye, Los Angeles.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In this case, your -- your
grade for consistency depends on this answer.
(Laughter.)
MR. KLEVEN:  Excuse me?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your grade for consistency
depends on this answer.
MR. KLEVEN:  What I'm saying, Your Honors,
is the State is arguing for a sliding scale that changes
things.  The Court postulated, in Florida v. J.L., a
situation that was so extreme, that was so unique, that
the Court might decide to address it without even
getting into reasonable suspicion.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But -- that's why I asked
you, and I pressed the point a little bit, because in
the beginning of your brief, it says that the anonymous
tip, what did you say, indicated that a Ford F-150
pickup truck had run someone off the road.
MR. KLEVEN:  That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, maybe you do have to be
known specially whether the person's drunk or not, but
you don't have to have some special knowledge of
anything concealed to know if somebody has run somebody
off the road.
MR. KLEVEN:  But, Your Honor, the -- the
idea of running off the road is concealed --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Even if the person weren't
drunk, I think it's illegal to run someone else off the
road.
(Laughter.)
MR. KLEVEN:  I'm not disagreeing with Your
Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.
MR. KLEVEN:  What I'm saying is that, unless
the person is still driving erratically by the time that
the officers arrive, then that activity is concealed in
the same way that the question of whether J.L. had a gun
or not was concealed.  You can't -- the officers can't
see it, and, therefore, there's no reason to treat this
case any differently than the case in J.L.
They have to be able to see something like
erratic driving or something else, in order to be able
to corroborate that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I assume you would --
you would also say, to tie it into Justice Breyer's
question, you would also say that that tip, "Somebody
ran me off the road," would not justify the court -- the
police in stopping the car, just to make sure that this
car was not the one that drove the guy off the road,
right?
MR. KLEVEN:  That's right, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Never mind drunkenness.
The tip doesn't say anything about drunkenness.  It just
said, this car drove me off the road.  You'd say the
police could not follow that car, pull him over, and --
and ask did you -- did you drive somebody off the road?
MR. KLEVEN:  Your Honor, absolutely, the
police can follow that car, and that's what they should
do.  And, in fact, that's what they did here.  In this
case, there was a --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Following the car is going
to do them no good as to whether he drove -- drove
somebody off the road.  They're not looking for a drunk.
They're looking for somebody who drove somebody off the
road, right?
MR. KLEVEN:  Right.  If they can't see any
erratic driving still going on, then where is it going
to go?  They're not going to prosecute for the reckless
driving that allegedly took place 19 miles away, and
they have followed that car for an additional --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They could if the guy
admitted it, you know.
MR. KLEVEN:  Other than that, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They could play Mutt and
Jeff with him and he -- oh, yeah, I did, yes.
MR. KLEVEN:  But, Your Honor, the -- the
person who's making the claim is -- is nowhere to be
found.  She's gone.  There's -- there's nowhere there.
So there's no additional investigation --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you --
what if -- what if the person said, okay, my name is
this -- you know, my phone number is this; this guy
drove me off the road.  They can't corroborate that
until they stop the guy.  Or you're saying they have to?
They have to wait, they have to make the call, see if
the guy is there.  Are you the guy that just called?  So
that guy's got to talk on his cell phone while he's
driving.
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, what I'm saying is, yes,
they have to verify in some way so that they have some
reason to believe that, in fact, the person that's
telling them this is actually the person that is
being -- so I'd like to reserve the remainder of my
time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Laurence.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY M.K. LAURENCE
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LAURENCE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
A police officer may act on an anonymous tip
that reports reckless or drunk driving by immediately
stopping the vehicle, without waiting to personally
observe dangerous driving that could threaten others.
An officer can reasonably rely on such a tip
because the importance of the governmental interest in
protecting the public from the ongoing and immediate
threat of drunk driving outweighs the minimal intrusion
of a traffic stop.
Now, Petitioners argue that -- -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is every reckless
driving drunk driving?
MR. LAURENCE:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is every reckless
driving drunk driving?
MR. LAURENCE:  Not every reckless driving is
drunk driving.  But a report of reckless driving gives
reasonable suspicion that the person may be drunk, and
that's sufficient for the stop in this case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about if somebody
just calls and says, X vehicle is driving recklessly,
says no more, doesn't describe how, doesn't give you any
details as to how they know it.  Is that enough for
reasonable suspicion?
MR. LAURENCE:  I would say that the term
"reckless" is.  And the reason I say that is because
driving is something that's intimately familiar to the
average citizen.  And when a citizen is going to call in
and make a report, when they use the language
"reckless," that has meaning.  That describes a behavior
that poses an ongoing threat to the public.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But not necessarily
drunkenness.  I think there -- there are a lot of people
that get tickets for reckless driving who have not
served jail terms for driving drunk.  The two are far
from synonymous.
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, I wouldn't say they're
synonymous, but I would say that one is the indicator of
the other because while you can --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why?  How about
speeding?  There's plenty of people who speed regularly.
MR. LAURENCE:  I would say a report of
speeding is not sufficient to have reasonable suspicion.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that reckless
behavior?  So how do you know someone who calls -- my
mother, who can't drive above 50, thinks that, when I go
51, that I'm speeding and reckless.
MR. LAURENCE:  I would say that, once again,
the public has lots of familiarity with driving, and
they can recognize the difference between poor driving
and reckless driving, or something, or drunk driving.
And when people are going to pick up the phone and make
that call to 911, they're doing so because they perceive
a danger on the roadway.
And I think while the statistics are sparse
on this, the footnote 2 in the government's brief is
particularly helpful in this regard, in that they note
that for calls that are made to 911 centers for -- that
are tracked by the States, between 25 and 50 percent of
those calls result in arrests.  And what that shows is
that the public knows what they see when they make these
calls.
This is a far --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and between the,
what, 50 and 75 percent, they've stopped people without
just cause.
MR. LAURENCE:  Yes, but we are talking about
reasonable suspicion.  So it doesn't require certainty
or probability.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or they've -- they've
troubled people who shouldn't have been troubled.
MR. LAURENCE:  That is correct.  And that is
always a possibility in the reasonable suspicion
context.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what if the
call is -- you know, I'm driving, this guy just drove by
me, I looked over, he didn't have his seatbelt on.  I
mean, can the police pull that guy over?
MR. LAURENCE:  No, I don't believe that
would be sufficient to pull him over because you don't
have any governmental -- you don't have a threat to
public safety in that context.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well yeah, there are laws
against driving without a seatbelt because that protects
people's lives.
MR. LAURENCE:  Certainly, there are laws,
and the officer, I guess, would have reasonable
suspicion that there is a traffic violation, but I don't
know that it would rise to the level of implicating
public safety in this context.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, reckless driving
always does, whether it -- whether it's the consequence
of inebriation or not.
MR. LAURENCE:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So a simple call saying,
boy, this guy -- you know, he cut in, in front of me.
He's changing lanes too frequently --
MR. LAURENCE:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that -- that enables the
policeman, without observing any of that reckless
driving, to stop the car further down the road.
MR. LAURENCE:  Yes.  And provided, of
course, that you have the additional details of the
description of the car, the location, that you can --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I've never
understood -- what good do those -- you know, let's say
that I'm at a party, I don't like somebody there.  I see
they have a couple of drinks.  I know what kind of car
he drives.  I know the -- I can look at the license
plate.
I call -- you know, ten minutes later.  I
know where he goes driving home.  There's this car.
It's a white whatever.  It's got this license plate.
It's swerving all over the road.
MR. LAURENCE:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Whether he is or
not, the police go up, they pull him over and find out,
yeah -- you know, he fails the breathalyzer, and I
get my revenge.
MR. LAURENCE:  The importance of those
details is that they allow the officers to confirm that
this is a personal observation, which is an important
fact that's noted in Gates, that when you have a report
of personal observation of illegal conduct, we can take
that report more seriously.
It's entitled to more credibility than just
a bare --
JUSTICE BREYER:  My question --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was just going to
say my point is it need not necessarily be a personal
observation of the person operating the car.  It may be
prior knowledge.  And I gather one of the issues we're
concerned about is people using this to -- you know,
exact revenge or -- or do something else having nothing
to do with whether or not the person is violating the
law on the highway.
MR. LAURENCE:  Yes, that is true.  But if
the personal knowledge -- if the officer can use that
personal knowledge to confirm, okay, he was correct
about the report of the car, report of the location,
report of the direction where it's supposed to be going,
then you have some indication that the personal
knowledge is accurate, as opposed to a bare tip when
you're talking about hidden conduct, then you have to
look to predicted details.
And that takes us into the J.L. context or
the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  If I understand you
correctly, as long as you can identify the car, you need
no specificity as to what the car has actually done.  In
other words -- you know, just saying the driver was
reckless is enough.  Is that -- is that correct?
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, I would say that
recklessness carries information that is -- has some
specificity.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What would fail your test?
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, if a caller calls in
and says, I saw him in a bar, he had one drink, he came
out and got on the road and went away.  One drink is not
going to rise to the level --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  But you're just
saying -- I mean, but his basic point is, on the other
side, is these are all variations of the famous white
horse defense.  You don't know the -- the white horse
defense?  Your Honor, my client was innocent because, at
the time of the crime, he was in Yugoslavia wearing a
white horse -- riding a white horse.
And to prove it, I have the horse here in
court.  You see?  I mean, you can't -- it's
bootstrapping to put it more succinctly.  All you know
is that somebody came in and quoted -- and said there
was a crime.  And that's all you know.  And now -- now
when -- when are instances where no more than the report
that it's a crime, that's reasonable suspicion.
That's -- give me some other instances where
the courts have upheld, well, that's enough.
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, if a caller says --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not saying common
sense.  I'm saying what the courts have held.  Sorry.
(Laughter.)
MR. LAURENCE:  Where the courts have upheld
based on just a bare tip or --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Not a bare--, a
description that a crime is occurring, where has --
that's all, I mean, and -- and then we have a question
of, well, is it in the one category or the other?
Because what we have here, someone phones in and says, a
crime is occurring.
And -- and we know, we've corroborated the
following.  If a crime was occurring, he was in a
position to know because he can define -- he can talk
about the white horse, or he can talk about the car.
MR. LAURENCE:  The closest case I can think
of is Hensley, where an officer was relying on an arrest
bulletin from another jurisdiction.  And in that case,
United States v. Hensley, in that case, the court did
consider, for purposes of whether a prior crime had been
committed, whether the officer had reasonable suspicion
to stop that individual, it took into account the nature
of the offense and whether there's a current threat to
public safety.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, correct me if I'm
wrong, but my recollection of Hensley is, you're right,
the police department 1 notifies police department 2.
But a premise of the case, I had thought, was that
police department 1 had reasonable suspicion.
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, there were two parts to
the -- to the case.  The second -- the first part was
whether you could make a detention based on a prior
crime, as opposed to current -- an immediate occurring
crime.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understand that.
MR. LAURENCE:  And so it looked to the
nature of the crime and whether there was threat to
public safety is a validation consideration in
authorizing a stop for a prior offense.
The second part of that was the -- allowing
the officer to rely on another jurisdiction
is reasonable --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Hensley's victim wasn't
a victim; meaning there was -- it was an anonymous tip?
MR. LAURENCE:  No, it was from another
police jurisdiction.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah, that's what I'm
saying.  So it wasn't an anonymous tip?
MR. LAURENCE:  No, it was not an anonymous
tip.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It wasn't public safety.
It was the report of a crime by a known person.
MR. LAURENCE:  Yes, it was.  And in that
case, the Court said that you could arrest for prior --
for a prior offense, if it was a felony.  It reserved
the question of whether you could do so for a
misdemeanor.  So it's already looking at the nature of
the offense and the threat to public safety.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, Mr. Laurence, do I
understand what you're saying?  You're saying that in
every case when we have to decide whether the threshold
level of reasonable suspicion has been met or whether
the level of probable cause has been met, that courts
can take into account the seriousness of the offense,
and what would not count as probable cause for one crime
will count as probable cause for another?  Is that what
you're saying?
MR. LAURENCE:  What I'm saying is that, in
terms of when we can deem a tip reliable -- White
identified two components to the inquiry.  One is the
indicia of reliability, and the other was the content of
the tip.  And so we have to take the seriousness of the
offense and the threat to public safety into account, in
determining when the officer can rely on that
information.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I don't understand how
what you're saying is different from what I just said,
and that would seem to me to work quite a substantial
change in -- in Fourth Amendment law, that when we
decide whether reasonable suspicion exists, when --
whether probable cause exists, that we get to take into
account how serious the offense is.
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, I think, since the
inception of the doctrine, this Court identified in
Terry that reasonable suspicion results from a balancing
of the governmental interest --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  The balancing occurs
categorically.  We decide that there's a reasonable
suspicion standard by balancing interests.  What we
don't do is say -- you know, depending on how serious we
think this crime is, more or less will meet that
reasonable suspicion standard.
That would be a very substantial reworking
of Fourth Amendment law -- or so it seems to me.  Maybe
I'm wrong.
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, I believe that was
something that was indicated in Hensley.  This Court
looked to the nature of the offense in deciding whether
or not the officer had reasonable suspicion at the
inception in making that stop for a crime that had
occurred two weeks earlier.
And it didn't -- it declined to consider
whether or not that would be sufficient for a
misdemeanor.  But in taking the seriousness of the crime
into account, in determining whether or not they could
make that stop, that's a recognition that balancing does
play some role.
And in White, this Court recognized that the
reliability component is variable.  There's a difference
between probable cause and reasonable suspicion.  And in
J.L., this Court left open the question of at what point
do we need no reliability because of the seriousness of
the government --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you explain to me
one more time why it's relevant that there were these
details that it was a particular kind of crime, that it
was silver, the license plate, that's this case.
Suppose in another case, a car just ran me off the road,
and it's the only -- the only car that's on Highway 1
between Fort Bragg and the state park.
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, I think it helps
twofold.  There's particularity, so you know who you're
stopping.  And it goes to the totality of the
circumstances in helping confirm that the person
actually observed what they're saying.
So that you have -- it goes to the
reliability of the personal observation.  So it
builds -- it adds an additional layer of -- of the
indices reliability so the officer can rely on it
sooner.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And incidentally -- it
doesn't have much to do with the case -- is this a
two -- a two-lane road?
MR. LAURENCE:  Yes, it is, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's what I thought.
MR. LAURENCE:  Two-lane coastal highway,
which, obviously, when someone runs somebody off the
road, poses a grave threat to public safety in that
context.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's a tip that
someone is carrying a concealed weapon, and we have held
that that has to be corroborated -- corroborated.  You
can take out a concealed weapon in an instant and fire
it and kill lots of people.  In fact, it was pointed out
that there are more deaths caused by guns than there are
from drunk driving.
So what's the difference?  The -- the
argument on the drunk driving is very, very dangerous,
but so is having a gun in one's pocket.
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, I think there's a
significant difference between having a gun in your
pocket and actually brandishing it or firing it.  I
think, if the J.L. case involved somebody threatening
other people with a gun or firing the gun, it would have
involved a different calculus.
And so --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if you -- once --
once you brandish it, it's too late.  The damage will be
caused.
MR. LAURENCE:  That is -- that is correct.
But once you're driving drunk down the road, it's -- you
have -- the threat is now posed to everybody on the
highway because of the potential for that person to lose
control because --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, this call didn't
say, I think the guy was drunk.  It just said, somebody
drove -- you know, drove me off the road.
MR. LAURENCE:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right?  So this isn't -- it
isn't a call that says there's a drunken driver.  It's
just a call that says somebody drove irresponsibly,
right?  And that's enough to stop them.
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, I would say -- I would
say that, in this case, it is enough.  But I would say
it's more than just driving irresponsibly.  Running
somebody off the road reflects that they're incapable of
driving their car in a way that's -- without posing a
safety threat to other people, and when you're dealing
with reasonable suspicion --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Really
irresponsibly, okay?
MR. LAURENCE:  Okay.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Really irresponsibly.
MR. LAURENCE:  Very irresponsibly.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So do you think,
Mr. Laurence, if the police had followed this man for
half an hour and seen no other signs of erratic
driving and nobody can drunk drive -- can drive drunk
for half an hour without swerving, without doing
something else.
So they could still have stopped the car?
MR. LAURENCE:  I think there may be a point
where the threat to public safety would suggest that the
reasonable suspicion is dissipated in that context.  And
so after -- after 50 miles --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I thought you were
saying as long as somebody had -- had given an account
that, some time ago, he had driven another driver off --
he had run another driver off the road, doesn't matter
whether you're drunk, doesn't matter anything, there was
an account of an illegal act taking place, and that was
enough to stop him.  It doesn't matter what he's doing
now.
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, I believe that the
threat to public safety plays a role in the balance.
And so if that's dissipated, then at that point, you
have -- the -- the reliability of the tip that you're
relying on is not as significant.  Put it this way:
When you have the threat to public safety balanced in
the totality for purposes of reliability, if that
dissipates, then you have to go back to the tip itself,
whether it is internally reliable or whether it has
enough to satisfy J.L.
I think that, when you have an immediate
threat and you have a report of drunk driving, the
officer shouldn't have to wait to see that 50 miles, to
see if they can pass or fail.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It wasn't a report of drunk
driving.
MR. LAURENCE:  I'm sorry.  Yes.  A report
that someone ran him off the road.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Somebody ran me off the
road.  Somebody was driving really irresponsibly.
MR. LAURENCE:  Yes.  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's enough to stop him
down the road.
MR. LAURENCE:  It is, it is, because this is
how drunk drivers display their actions.  And when
you're dealing with reasonable suspicion --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about cutting me off
too quickly, you know?
MR. LAURENCE:  I think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Cuts right in front of me.
Really ticks me off.
(Laughter.)
MR. LAURENCE:  That would present a
different set of circumstances.  If you have an
instant -- a recognizable instant of bad driving as
opposed to something that reflects recklessness or
drunkenness, then you analyze the tip differently.  And
I think that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how would somebody --
how would somebody ever be able -- who observes another
car driving ever be able to say that person was drunk?
All they could -- all they could observe is what they
see.  They don't know whether the person -- what is
causing that kind of behavior.
MR. LAURENCE:  I agree.  And that's because
what we do -- we look to the nature of their driving,
draw reasonable inferences from that.  And that's all
officers can ever do.  When they observe something, they
draw reasonable inferences and determine whether it
gives them suspicion.
One thing I would point out, that the CHP
dispatchers, the testimony in this case reflects that
they asked.  They asked the driver, well, what did you
see?  So that they can get that information and pass it
along to give the officers as much as possible--
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it's an entirely
different case if the tip -- if the tip here was -- you
know, I was at a party, this guy got in his car, he
should not have turned the key on in that car, this guy
is really drunk, you should stop that car on the road.
I think that's totally different from
somebody just saying, this guy swerved, or this guy
drove me off the road.  You're -- you're just making the
assumption that -- that every -- every one of those
incidents demonstrates a drunk behind the wheel, and I
just don't think that's true.
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, again, I would say it's
not about demonstrating.  It's not about certainty or
probabilities.  It's suspicion.  And that behavior
allows the officer to suspect drunk driving.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why is it limited to
drunk driving?  I don't understand that.  I've been --
I've been on an expressway, and I've had people go by
me at -- they went by in a blur.  They must have been
going well over a hundred miles an hour.
Now, if the police catch up with that
person, of course, the person's going to slow down while
the police follow the person.  And then when the police
decide to stop, they're going to go back to engaging in
this intentional, extremely dangerous conduct.
So I don't understand why there's a
distinction between reporting that somebody necessarily
is driving erratically, so the person may be impaired,
and somebody who is -- where you have extremely reckless
driving that's intentional.
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, I wouldn't draw that
distinction.  I think reckless driving, in and of
itself, can pose a threat to public safety that also
mandates an immediate stop.  If someone's playing
chicken with another car on the road, if someone
is -- you know, trying-- testing out their new Ferrari, is going
a hundred miles an hour, weaving in and out of lanes,
those all represent threats to public safety.
All those circumstances --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But all crime represents a
threat to public safety, and yet, we have these
standards.
MR. LAURENCE:  Yes, we do have standards.
But that -- the threat to public safety is part of the
totality of circumstances.  It's not something you
invoke that wipes away all other inquiries.  What we
have here is we have a tip that, if it was given by a
known person, I think would undoubtedly allow the
officer to pull that car over immediately.
The question is because it was anonymous --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why?  Why -- the -- we
have the case of the trusted informer.  The informer
several times has given the police tips and it turned
out to be right.  And then we have another side, the
anonymous person.  Then there's somebody who calls,
gives a correct name and address, but no record at all
of reliability.
Why should the fact that the name is
known -- the name of the informant is known, if the
police have no reason to believe one way or another that
this informer is reliable?
MR. LAURENCE:  Well, I believe that, when
you're looking at -- at what point it's reasonable for
the officer to rely on the content of that tip or to
rely on -- on that tip coming in and act on it, that
when somebody gives their name, that adds a layer of
reliability to it, even without verification.
And I think one thing that Gates says in the
context of somebody who reports a -- a personal
observation of a crime is that even if we doubt their
veracity, even if we have some question as to their
motives, the fact that they are giving a personal
observation, they note that it's a personal observation,
and giving a detailed account of what occurs, that
report is entitled to a greater degree of reliability
than --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't think that a
teenager standing on a street corner with a couple of
other teenagers with a gun in his belt represents a
threat to public safety?
MR. LAURENCE:  Not the same threat as in
this case, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No?  All right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
No, no.  We're going to hear from Ms. Kovner
first.
Ms. Kovner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MS. KOVNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Brief car stops based on anonymous tips of
reckless or drunken driving are reasonable under the
Fourth Amendment because they serve a critical
government interest in removing drunk drivers from the
roadway --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Please
define for me what behavior would give police officers
or what descriptors would be adequate for the police to
think someone's drunk.  Swerving, I know, has been
mentioned.  But reckless driving, there's been a lot of
discussion that there could be a wide variety of
reckless driving.
MS. KOVNER:  So --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- what other
things would a -- would a caller have to say?
MS. KOVNER:  So, Your Honor, I think -- I
agree with the observation that there are some behaviors
that pose an ongoing threat to others on the roadway,
and some driving violations that don't.  NHTSA, the
National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration and
other organizations, do keep track of what kinds of
behavior are associated with drunkenness.
And the Court, in this case, of course,
looked at the particular behavior and said, is this
really a reckless driving behavior, the kind of behavior
that poses this imminent danger?  So there is a line
that courts would need to draw, but the courts that are
engaging in this kind of analysis do draw that.
And of course --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what -- what goes on
the other side of the line?  I mean, why -- why is this
on one side?  And then tell me what's on the other.
MS. KOVNER:  Sure.  So examples of behavior
on the other might be a seatbelt violation, and they
also might be behaviors that it's a real judgment call
whether a violation occurred or not.
So for instance, that person didn't fully
stop at a stop sign.  We might have doubts about whether
an informant, who we don't know anything about, can
accurately perceive that.  But when we're talking about
behavior like --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think what you're
saying to me, am I correct, that almost any moving
violation counts?  Changing a lane without a signal,
which seems to be endemic in Washington, but --
(Laughter.)
MS. KOVNER:  I think that would be a harder
case.  I'm not sure that it's correlated with -- with
intoxication or impairment.  As you say, it's very
common, but I think the behavior that we're talking
about here, driving somebody else off the road, is the
kind of behavior that shows this person is a --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  How about somebody cutting
someone off in their lane?
MS. KOVNER:  I think that's close to the
line, Your Honor.  I'm not sure that it's always
illegal, and it's something where we may have doubts
about whether the informant can accurately separate this
person was breaking the law from this person wasn't.  I
think the courts are going to have to answer the
question of whether this is the -- you know, kind of
behavior that poses --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, where does
that -- I think this is the question Justice Kagan asked
earlier -- how does the nature of the offense affect the
reasonableness of the suspicion?
MS. KOVNER:  So --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, in either
case, you have -- let's say the seatbelt and the
swerving driver.  It's the same witness.  He said,
still, it's a white Ford.  The reasonableness of the
suspicion would seem, to me, to be totally divorced from
what it's about.
MS. KOVNER:  I think that's true, Your
Honor, and we actually think and -- you know, we argued
in our brief that there is reasonable suspicion here.
When an informant gives a basis for knowledge, you have
reason to think they are an eyewitness.
But the Court has also recognized that there
are certain dangers on the roadway that allow
intrusions, even when we might not otherwise allow them.
So, for instance, in the Sitz case, the Court said drunk
that drunk driving is such a great danger that we're
going to allow even random stops of vehicles to detect
drunk drivers.  So I think the court has indicated there
are certain driving behaviors that are so dangerous
we'll allow even suspicionless stops.
And here, of course, we're not dealing with
suspicionless stops.  The questions from the Court have
indicated some of the reasons why that's the case.
Here, we have a caller who has demonstrated their basis
for knowledge, and officers have been able to confirm
that.  So we're talking about tips where the person
relays the kind of details you can really only have if
you are an eyewitness to this person's driving on the
road.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's just
not true.  It's -- it's an acquaintance, I know what
kind of car he drives, I know where he's going.  I
didn't see anything on the road, but I call the police
and say, oh, there's this -- you know, white Ford
swerving all over the road.
MS. KOVNER:  So, Your Honor, I think this
class of people who are going to have the relevant
knowledge is almost exclusively eyewitnesses.  You may
also have a few people who have seen the person's car
and happen to know what direction they're headed in, but
for the most part, we're talking about a very narrow
class of individuals that are largely going to be
eyewitnesses to this person's driving on the road.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I'm talking
about the concern that you want to have the police pull
over people that you don't like, where you know
somebody's got something bad in the car, and you don't
like it, and so you're going to take advantage of the
fact that the police don't have to observe anything, and
yet, you can still get them to pull over this person.
MS. KOVNER:  So somebody who's malicious,
who's a prankster, is still going to have this kind of
specialized knowledge, and that's not something a
malicious prankster is necessarily going to have.  I --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why is that different
from the knowledge in J.L., that they were three young
men, and they were described, and the caller said, "The
one with the gun is the one with the plaid shirt."  All
of that was corroborated by the police, and yet, we held
that that was no indication that a crime had been
committed.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, I think the
critical thing that's present here that wasn't present
in J.L. is the basis for knowledge.  So as the passage
that Justice Breyer read signals, we're talking there
about concealed criminal activity, and the Court pointed
out in that case there's nothing in the tip that signals
how the informant knows this person had a gun.
Here, in contrast, the person is telling you
"I'm an eyewitness.  This person just ran me off the
road."
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But then you think J.L.
would have come out differently if the tipster had said,
"I just saw these guys and I saw -- you know, one of
them had a gun"?
MS. KOVNER:  I think this case comes out
differently for two reasons.  One is, yes, the tip would
be stronger than the tip in J.L., if the person related
eyewitness basis.  But the second has to do with the
imminent danger here that's posed by a car that's moving
down the roadway and that's being operated by a
potentially drunk driver, and the reduced expectations
of privacy you have when you're talking about a vehicle
stop.
And those were front and center in Sitz,
where the Court said that even suspicionless stops can
be justified by that particular danger.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah, but that -- but that
second danger -- you may have a drunken driver on the
road; that danger can be eliminated by following the
car.  You don't have to stop the car right away.  You
can follow it and if, indeed, the driver seems to be
driving erratically, then you can stop.  You'd have
probable cause.
I don't think you have to automatically
allow a stop in order to prevent all of the horribles
that are going to arise from drunk driving.  Follow the
car.  If he's behaving like a drunk driver, then stop
him.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, officers could
follow the car, and if they do, they may witness a
subsequent dangerous behavior that could justify pulling
over the car.  The problem is that the subsequent
dangerous behavior they may observe may be the car
swerving into another lane and hitting another vehicle.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That is so remote.  I mean,
it seems to me you're asking us to adopt a broad rule
that is contrary to what we normally do for searches and
seizures because, now and then, it would seem, to me,
very rarely, before the police can stop the drunk
driver, he kills somebody.
I mean, I suppose that could happen now and
then but it's pretty fanciful.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, I don't think it's
a remote harm at all.  Now, this is a harm that causes
one-third of all traffic accidents, that takes tens of
thousands of lives a year, and it's a harm that this
Court has always said is a harm of the first order that
justifies the kind of intrusions that we might not
otherwise allow in --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But here, we have the
police did follow the vehicle for about 5 miles and saw
nothing erratic about the driving.  So perhaps, if the
police had immediately stopped the person or -- but
don't -- don't we have to take account that there was no
corroboration?  When the police get there.  Even if they
could stop him instantly, when they have no
corroboration, then that doesn't amount to reasonable
suspicion.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, I agree that police
might follow a car for such a long period of time that
the reasonable suspicion would dissipate.  On the facts
of this case, Your Honor, the record indicates there
were five minutes between when the officers first saw
the car and when they pulled it over.
They weren't five minutes of uninterrupted
observation.  They were five minutes in which the
officers were turning their cars around because they
were headed in the opposite direction, were catching up
to a car along the freeway.  So the California Supreme
Court analyzed that delay and found the fact that they
didn't observe additional --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know if we have to
get into the drunk driving.  It's 3 miles south of the
Humboldt County border on -- do you know the answer to
this?  Is it in the record?  I mean, on many sections of
that road, in Mendocino County, you drive someone off
the road, they are dead.
I mean, there are sheer drops, and so I just
wonder, if I look that up here, what's the situation
where this supposedly took place?
MS. KOVNER:  The only thing I can point to
about that, Your Honor, is the way that the California
Supreme Court treated this, which is that, because they
pointed to the fact that this is a two-lane highway and
that it's particularly dangerous on this particular road
to engage in this behavior.
But I don't know about -- you know, whether
there are cliffs on the side of the road.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the
danger from the police side?  In other words, they
know -- or they suspect that the guy driving the white
car has a lot of marijuana in the trunk.  They have no
basis for pulling him over.  And they say, well, guess
what, we got an anonymous tip that he was driving
erratically, so we pulled him over.
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What protection is
there against that?
MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, if police are
willing to lie about what they saw or -- you know, in
the cases of some rogue officers, they may exist, but
this rule isn't going to prevent -- no rule is going to
prevent that.  Officers could just as easily lie about
what they saw.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Kleven, you have 3 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. KLEVEN,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS,
APPOINTED BY THIS COURT
MR. KLEVEN:  In this case, we're talking
about a single uncorroborated tip of reckless driving.
After that single incident, the car -- the truck went
for approximately 19 miles with no indication of any
other problem and then was followed for up to 5 miles by
the police officers, again, with no indication of any
erratic driving or any other violation that would have
been a reason for pulling him over immediately.
There's no reason to believe that the driver
of this truck presented any kind of danger about being
about to lose control, which is the argument that the
State is relying on, and the Federal government, and
neither one of them came up with any anecdote, even,
where that actually occurred, much less any statistics
that show that that is a serious problem, of people
losing control while they're being under surveillance by
the police officers.
This case is even farther away from the bomb
situation than J.L. was.  In J.L., you had a person who
was armed, who could have pulled out a gun and started
firing at any moment.  Here, you have something where
there's no indication of any ongoing risk to the public.
I don't think -- I don't know that there's a good answer
to the bomb question.
I read through the transcript from the oral
argument in J.L.  I didn't see any -- you know, there
didn't seem to be any good arguments -- any good
discussions there, either, as to which way the Court
could go.
But this case -- in J.L., the Court said,
there's no reason for us to resolve that.  We don't have
to speculate about a situation where that would happen.
In this case, I submit, there's even less reason for the
Court to speculate about the bomb situation or even the
kidnapping situation.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I find that
unsatisfactory because if you -- unless you're willing
to say, it doesn't matter whether it's a bomb, an atomic
bomb, a little bomb, then there -- there must be -- if
you're going to draw the line someplace, then you're
going to have to distinguish between those reports of
crimes that are serious enough to be on one side of the
line and those reports of a crime that are not serious
enough to be on that side of the line.
You either have to go all the way, or you
have to draw a line, and if you're going to draw a line,
I would like to know where the line is.
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, Your Honor, except I
don't think -- I don't think you can draw the line in
terms of reasonable suspicion because, then, you're
going to have this --
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Forget about
reasonable suspicion.  Just can it be done?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, certainly, Your Honor --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You can say it can never
done, even if it's an atomic bomb, even if it's some
other type of bomb.  You can say that.  Or you can say,
no, there's a line someplace.  If you're going to say
there's a line someplace, then, really, I think you need
to tell us where the line is.
MR. KLEVEN:  Your Honor, I think the line is
certainly, when we get into the bomb situation, but not
in terms of reasonable suspicion.  The severity of the
crime does not affect it, but the Court could fashion a
rule that would say there's an exception in this case
that would apply --
JUSTICE ALITO:  For a bomb.  For any kind of
a bomb?
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, I don't think -- I think
if -- if there's a call in that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It has to be a big bomb.
MR. KLEVEN:  -- that says a white -- a white
Prius has a bomb -- you know, that doesn't seem to be
the sort of case under the -- under the established
circumstances where this Court would find a reasonable
suspicion --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about drawing the line
at intentional conduct?  The guy who has a bomb is going
to use it.  He's intentionally going to use it.
MR. KLEVEN:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or maybe intentionally
doing an action that is going to harm more than one
person, as opposed to, hmm, maybe this person might
accidentally, because he's inub-- inebriated, hurt somebody?
It seems to me there's a clear line between
somebody who's -- who's bent on an intentional crime and
somebody who might harm somebody because of his conduct.
You like that one?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, I have another
one, too.
MR. KLEVEN:  Yes, Your Honor, I think
those -- those are two significant distinctions,
certainly, between the -- the bomb analogy and the
situation, even in the drunken driving situation, where
you don't have anybody who is intentionally trying to
harm anyone and the magnitude of the risk is -- is much
greater.  The --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So somebody has five
drinks and goes and gets in the car, that's not
intentionally trying to harm someone?  Or recklessly
trying to harm --
MR. KLEVEN:  Well, in terms of their --
their decision to get drunk, there's intent there, in
terms of -- by the time the officer becomes aware of it,
there's no indication that that drunk driver is going
down the road trying to harm somebody.
There is an indication that they may be
too -- too inebriated to be driving properly, and police
officers are pulling people over for that situation
since the car was invented, and they're really good at
it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MR. KLEVEN:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel.
The case is submitted.
