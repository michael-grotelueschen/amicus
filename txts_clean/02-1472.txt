Mr. Miller.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LLOYD B. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF THE CHEROKEE NATION
AND SHOSHONE-PAIUTE TRIBES
MR. MILLER: Justice Stevens, and may it please
the Court:
These two contract cases concern whether the
Government is liable in money damages under the Contract
Disputes Act and section 110 of the Indian Self-
Determination Act when the Secretary fails to fully pay a
contract price for the --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you mind explaining to
us how these two cases relate? The Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit decision went one way and the Tenth
Circuit went another. And are the claims at all
overlapping? How are they differentiated?
MR. MILLER: No, Justice O'Connor. They're --
they're not overlapping. The claims in the Federal
Circuit case involved three contracts covering fiscal
years 1994, 1995, and 1996. And the Cherokee contract at
issue in the case that went through the Tenth Circuit is
fiscal year 1997 contract and funding agreement.
The section -- remedial section of the act,
section 110 --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But they're certainly at odds
on the legal theory.
MR. MILLER: Yes, they are, Your Honor. The
Federal Circuit applied standard, bedrock Government
contracting law, primarily the rule that when a contract
payment is conditioned on there being an appropriation,
the payment right vests in full once the appropriation is
enacted by Congress.
And secondly, the court ruled that the Indian
Self-Determination Act does not bar the payment of the
contracts in this case under the circumstances presented.
And to the contrary. We submit that the Secretary's
construction of that clause would undo the act, would undo
section 106(b) of the act --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are the circumstances any
different in the two situations, the Cherokee Nation case
and the one in the Federal Circuit? Are -- are the
circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any
respect that could account for a difference in outcome?
MR. MILLER: No, Justice O'Connor. There --
there is no difference in that respect, and there is an
overlap in -- in this sense. The Shoshone-Paiute contract
that arose through the Tenth Circuit case did involve
fiscal year 1996, the same fiscal year as the Cherokee
contract that covered fiscal year 1996. So in that sense,
both cases involved the -- the same relevant issues.
The -- the key, we think, to the resolution of
the act is found in the act on page 12a of the appendix to
our opening blue brief. The act was amended in this
section twice, in 1988 and in 1994, for three reasons: to
secure contract funding, to reduce the Federal
bureaucracy, and to eliminate secretarial funding
discretion over contract funding issues.
In section 12a, 450j-1(a), the bottom half of
the page, it is stated in subparagraph (1) that the amount
of funds provided under the terms of self-determination
contracts entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall
not be less than the appropriate Secretary would have
otherwise provided.
And then directly pertinent to this case is
subparagraph (2), which directs -- which addresses
contract support costs. There shall be added to the
amount required by paragraph (1) contract support costs
which shall consist of certain items. Incidentally, these
items typically cover the cost of insurance, audit costs,
procurement costs that might otherwise be administered for
the Government by the Office of Personnel Management or
personnel costs that might otherwise be administered by
the Office of Personnel Management.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Does the -- do the actual
contracts reduce the -- the CSC's to a dollar amount or --
MR. MILLER: Yes, they do.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so we know -- they --
they knew at the moment the contract was signed what it
was going to cost.
MR. MILLER: That is correct, Justice Souter.
In the case of the Shoshone-Paiute contract, when the
parties decided to renegotiate the contract amount, they
entered into an amendment to specify the new, updated
contract amount.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't want to get ahead of
you in taking us through the statute, so you can defer the
question if -- if you choose. But it seems to me relevant
to (a). Does -- is -- is part of the submission that the
Government used some of the funds that otherwise would
have gone to you for its own monitoring and -- of -- of
health contracts and that that's what's in dispute? Or
was it just general overhead for other programs it used?
MR. MILLER: It -- it is precisely, Justice
Kennedy, what -- what you stated. In fact, we can turn
directly to page 14a --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I stated an or. I --
what I -- I stated at the outset?
MR. MILLER: The -- the Government took money
for its own Federal functions instead of -- including
contract monitoring --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Including contract monitoring.
MR. MILLER: Including contract monitoring.
Including contract monitoring. In fact, they say so in
their brief and -- and defend that action.
The -- the sections on page 12a and 13a
articulate in quite a lot of detail the nature of the
contract support costs that must be added.
JUSTICE SCALIA: These are strange contracts, of
course, aren't they? I mean, are there any other
contracts that the Government has to enter into? I mean,
the Secretary has to give these tribes the authority to
take over, in effect, implementation of the -- of a
Federal health program, doesn't he?
MR. MILLER: That is correct, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- why would you expect
that this strange kind of contract should -- should, prima
facie, be governed by the same rules as to appropriations
as other contracts --
MR. MILLER: Because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- where -- where an agency,
having due regard to how much money is appropriated, will
limit the number of contracts it enters into? But -- but
here you're creating a situation where the agency has to
contract and yet has no control over having enough money
to -- to meet the contractual obligations. It seems to me
a -- a strange way to run a railroad.
MR. MILLER: It -- it is a unique contractual
situation, Justice Scalia, but one that Congress fully
anticipated. And -- and I would explain it this way.
First of all, there is the Contract Disputes Act
which Congress said applies to these contracts. The
contracts were so unique that prior to 1988, the Interior
Board of Contract Appeals, in a decision called the Busby
case, had ruled that these contracts could not be enforced
under the Contract Disputes Act precisely for the reason
Justice Scalia articulated. Congress changed that. In
1988, Congress amended section 110 of the act, reproduced
at the bottom of page 26a, and gave the Court of Claims,
then the Court of Claims, and the district courts
concurrent jurisdiction over money damages claims under
the Contract Disputes Act. And the legislative history
explains that Congress did this precisely to overcome the
Busby decision and to make these contracts enforceable for
the stated contract price.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But further to Justice
Scalia's point, don't the contracts in question themselves
contain clauses that say this is not a procurement
contract?
MR. MILLER: The -- the procurement contract --
that is correct. Not the contracts themselves, Your
Honor. The -- the act says that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, the act says that they're
not procurement contracts.
MR. MILLER: -- the contracts are not
procurement contracts, Justice Kennedy. That's correct.
These contracts began as procurement contracts.
They had been procurement contracts, and even still, they
were not enforced under the Court of -- the Interior Board
of Contract Appeals decision in the Busby decision.
Congress relieved the contractors of the
procurement system because they felt that the agency had
built up an enormous contract monitoring bureaucracy which
it wanted to eliminate. And for that reason, it
eliminated the procurement rules in the hopes that the
contract monitoring bureaucracy would be eliminated along
with it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Miller, do --
MR. MILLER: Justice Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- on -- on the
interpretation you've just explained to us, does that mean
that the Secretary has no authority under this statute or
generally to reserve some portion of this for what you
call Federal functions, that it -- every penny of the
appropriation could go to the costs of this contract and
nothing left in the till for the so-called Federal
functions?
MR. MILLER: Justice Ginsburg, I -- I would put
my answer in this context. There are many sources from
which the Government could have reprogrammed to pay these
contracts. It could have been, yes, as we submit, from
the funds spent on Federal functions and secretarial
administration. It could have been from the up to $88
million increases Congress was making every year. It
could have been from the up to $98 million in leftover
appropriations the agencies had every year, and it could
have been from the regional and headquarters offices that
the agencies had where they don't administer services.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your -- your answer is,
yes, if it came to that, they --
MR. MILLER: That's the duty Congress imposed
upon the Secretary. The Secretary was free not to
reprogram. That's -- that's a choice the Secretary had
and the Secretary made it. The question is what are the
ramifications of that choice and we submit --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let me ask you another
question related. Suppose -- this is an individual
action. These are individual actions. They're not class
actions.
MR. MILLER: Correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do the ones who come to court
to sue get paid in full even though there may be many
other self-determination contracts out there, and that if
you gave them all their fair share, none of them would be
paid in full? Does it just depend on first come to court,
first served, and the less litigious are just out of luck?
MR. MILLER: Your Honor, we -- we do not believe
that that -- that should be the outcome. That would
advantage the contractors that came forward and not take
account of the entire situation. We think the global
situation has to be looked at. The total amount of the
contracts that were not paid in fiscal year 1994 --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you can't get blood out
of a turnip. I mean, Justice Ginsburg is asking the
question, what if there is not enough money to go around?
MR. MILLER: If there were only sufficient money
to pay half of the contract shortfalls --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. MILLER: -- without violating the clause and
the Secretary had the discretion not to reduce
appropriations, or he could, for programs serving other
tribes, and then the tribes would only be entitled to half
of the shortfall, if there was only a sufficient amount of
money.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Didn't the tribes get notice
they might not get the full amount of the -- the CSC, and
so they had ample opportunity to cut back on their
spending?
MR. MILLER: No, Justice Kennedy, and -- and to
the contrary. In fiscal year 1994, the Indian Health
Service was telling everybody they were paying them in
full. They told the General Accounting Office they paid
everybody in full on page 32 of the GAO report cited in
the Government's brief. But --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So these -- these are reliance
damages in a sense.
MR. MILLER: The -- the tribes expected to be
paid. The Shoshone-Paiute tribes were told they would be
paid in full in the first year.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, they -- they were out
of pocket for money they spent before they knew, other
than the statutory notice they had, that they wouldn't get
the full amount?
MR. MILLER: That is correct. That is correct.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, when do the tribal
contractors know how much money the Government actually
will have available to spend?
MR. MILLER: The contractors don't know until
the year is over because throughout the year, the
Government reserves the power, although not exercised, but
stated in a circular, to reprogram. And the
appropriations --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you mean by
that? You said a second ago the Secretary had the option
to reprogram. What do you mean by reprogram?
MR. MILLER: When the Secretary prepares a
budget to the Congress, it states usually a lump sum
amount of, say, $1.8 billion. We -- we take $400 million
off the top or $300 million off the top because that was
specified by Congress for certain purposes. But the
balance is a lump sum. The Secretary crafts a budget.
The budget is not adopted by Congress, just a dollar
amount is adopted by Congress. Now, Congress can step in
and take a particular item and earmark that item and cap
it if it chooses, but it didn't do that in these years.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but the -- the tribes
have to enter contracts not knowing how much money is
going to be there at the end of the day?
MR. MILLER: The tribes enter into contracts, as
most Government contractors do when they enter into
contracts before an appropriation is made, not knowing if
the agency will have the money to pay them. That's okay.
The problem is when the statute says it's subject to the
availability of appropriations and Congress enacts the
appropriations. It's been the law for 120 years that at
that point, the right to payment vests and the tribe is
entitled to be paid.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. So how was that
appropriation money in fact used by the Federal
Government, do you say?
MR. MILLER: The Federal Government --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: There was the appropriation.
MR. MILLER: Yes.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And the tribes had already
entered into contracts. Now, how was that lump sum used?
MR. MILLER: The agency then, under this Court's
teaching in Lincoln v. Vigil, has complete discretion over
how it spends its appropriation except insofar as --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that what you mean by
programming?
MR. MILLER: Yes, thank you, Justice Souter, for
taking me back to your question. What we mean is that the
Secretary submits a budget, but the budget is not binding
on the Secretary. It's not binding as a matter of law
because Congress didn't adopt it. And as conditions
change over the course of the year, the agency readjusts
its budget, which we call reprogramming.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So programming is allocating
various segments of the lump sum to various purposes.
MR. MILLER: Correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. MILLER: And the Secretary retains complete
discretion as this Court taught --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And is that done without
regard to the contract amounts that the tribes have
entered into?
MR. MILLER: Well, it should not be done without
regard to the contract amounts --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that in fact how it was
done?
MR. MILLER: That is in fact how it was done.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And is it still done that
way?
MR. MILLER: Well, the times have changed.
Since 1998, fiscal year 1998, Congress has imposed caps on
the contracts and court costs that the agency has. So
there's no question the agency cannot pay more than
Congress gives it. When Congress only gives it $100
million or $200 million for contract support costs, that's
it. The Secretary cannot be sued for failing to pay more.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But didn't -- didn't Congress,
even before that, impose a significant limitation on how
much the Secretary could pay? What do you with the
provision in -- in (b) of -- of the section that you were
reading from? Notwithstanding any other provision in this
subchapter, the provision of funds under this subchapter
is subject to the availability of appropriations and the
Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs,
projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds
available to another tribe or tribal organization under
this chapter. I mean, what -- what money that the
Secretary expends is -- is not expended for programs,
projects, or activities that serve a tribe?
MR. MILLER: Justice Scalia, we read this --
this clause with -- keeping in mind the first sentence
first of the sentence. The first sentence, which begins
on the preceding page, page 14a, says that the amount of
funds required by subsection (a), (1) shall not be reduced
to make funding available for contract monitoring or
administration by the Secretary. And the subparagraph (3)
in the middle of page 15a, shall not be reduced by the
Secretary to pay for Federal functions.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's all very good,
but --
MR. MILLER: But then there's an exception.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- then the last paragraph
begins with the word notwithstanding any other provision
of this subchapter. So this --
MR. MILLER: We --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems to me, overrides
everything else. Unless -- unless you can persuade me
that that -- that that provision doesn't give the
Secretary the authority to -- to allocate the available
funds among other activities that serve tribes, I -- I
think it trumps whatever else you appeal to.
MR. MILLER: Justice Scalia, for -- for two
reasons we think it cannot.
First of all, if that exception swallowed up the
rule set forth in the first sentence, it would defeat the
whole purpose of the act.
And more, in the statute on page 21, there is a
mandatory rule of construction that Congress has
articulated which, interestingly enough, the Government
never cites in the statutory interpretation case. And
this rule says on page 21, 1(a)(2), each provision of the
act --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait.
MR. MILLER: Page -- sorry --
JUSTICE SCALIA: 21 of --
MR. MILLER: 21a of our opening blue brief.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, 21a, good.
MR. MILLER: 21a, correct.
Each provision of the Indian Self-Determination
and Education Assistance Act and each provision of this
contract shall be liberally construed for the benefit of
the contractor. That statement is repeated as well in
every --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Oh, fine, but you still have
to look at that last sentence in subsection (b) and
grapple with what it means. The Secretary is not required
to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities
serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe.
MR. MILLER: So what could it mean? That's our
challenge.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, what does it mean?
MR. MILLER: We have to give it meaning. We
believe it means the -- as the Secretary always said when
-- and -- and said at the time these amendments were
adopted in 1988, that's services on the ground, the
hospitals and clinics. If I walked into the office of the
headquarters of the Indian Health Service in Rockville,
Maryland, I'm not going to see doctors and nurses in white
jackets. I'm not going to see patients and counselors.
There aren't programs serving tribes in these headquarters
offices, and in these area offices, large portions of what
they do are administrative functions.
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. May -- may I
interrupt you there? And tell me if I understand the --
the position in your brief correctly. I thought the
position that you took there was ultimately regardless of
what the notwithstanding clause means, there's enough
money to pay all the contracts in the appropriation that
is actually made. And if any money is going to be
squeezed, the person who's going to be squeezed or the --
is the -- is the agency itself. Its bureaucracy is going
to have less money. And I understood your argument to be
that given the provisions you read earlier in this
section, Congress has made a positive decision that if
there's a choice between paying the contract amounts and
squeezing the bureaucracy, the bureaucracy gets squeezed.
Is that your position?
MR. MILLER: That is our position.
JUSTICE SOUTER: If that is your position, do
you have to even grapple with difficulties about the
notwithstanding clause?
MR. MILLER: Well, we still need to provide some
meaning to the -- to the provision that says the Secretary
may not -- does not have to reduce funding for programs
serving other tribes. I guess, I think we do need to
grapple with the clause in order not to --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but I thought you were
saying you could -- you could -- the -- the Secretary
doesn't have to reduce funding for other tribes. The
Secretary can pay the full contract costs, and if anybody
is going to get the short end, it's going to be the
bureaucracy.
MR. MILLER: It's going to be the bureaucracy.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Just give them the -- just give
them the money.
MR. MILLER: It's not going to be the programs
on the ground serving the tribes. It's going to be the
bureaucracy.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. MILLER: Now, it may be felt --
JUSTICE SCALIA: To put it -- this is a
competition between two bureaucracies, the tribal
bureaucracy that is administering the program and the
Secretary's bureaucracy which is administering the program
of programs. I mean, it's -- it's not as though it's a
bureaucracy against the people. The whole purpose of this
was to turn over the bureaucratic management of these
programs from Government bureaucrats to tribal
bureaucrats. I mean, it --
MR. MILLER: Well, I would -- I would --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you -- you paint it as
though the -- you know, who cares about the bureaucrats.
The -- the Government just wasn't interested in the
bureaucrats. That may well be, but there -- there are
bureaucrats at both ends of this thing.
MR. MILLER: I say that for two reasons. First
of all, the -- the Congress, in our opinion, clearly
privileged the tribal contracts over the Secretary's
Federal functions.
But more practically, let's look at the
Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. They took over a hospital that
had a $5 million budget in round numbers, and the contract
support costs requirement was $2 million. So the contract
was in round numbers $7 million. So they get the
hospital, $5 million to run it. They don't get the $2
million. Now, they have $3 million to run the hospital.
It's not that they didn't get their bureaucracy. They
didn't get the full hospital operational budget because
they had to pay the fixed costs of carrying insurance,
undertaking the audits required by Federal law. There
were actual reductions in services so severe, in fact,
that the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe nearly lost accreditation.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you a basic
question --
MR. MILLER: Yes, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- which maybe others
understand, but I'm confused.
Imagine that this has nothing to do with
Indians. It is simply an ordinary contract. Now, my
understanding is that ordinary contracts say subject to
appropriations. So we have to decide was there an
appropriation. In our imaginary department of Government,
the appropriation is $1 billion. Nothing is earmarked for
anything. They enter into contracts that amount to $999
million. Now, they pay out $990 million, and their --
what the department says is, look, everybody knows we need
at least $10 million to run our central bureaucracy. So
there's no valid contract here. The appropriation wasn't
made.
Now, my understanding of ordinary Government
contract law is to decide whether that $10 million was in
principle available for the contracts. You look to
something called the purpose-time-amount test. So was it
during the same time? Yes. Is it in an appropriate
amount? Yes. But is it available for this purpose? Ah,
I'm not sure.
All right. Now, I want -- if I have the -- the
theory of it right, I want you to tell me what the money
was in your case that is the equivalent of the $10 million
in my example that you believe in principle was available
to pay these -- for this Indian expenditure. Just pretend
it's a regular contract. What is the equivalent of that
$10 million?
MR. MILLER: The equivalent of the $10 million
would be sums not spent on anything --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. MILLER: -- in this case, up to $100
million.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay. And anything else?
MR. MILLER: Any of the increases, any of the
sums. And then we move to this statute --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, forget this statute for a
second because I'll stop you there. I want you to tell me
why those sums -- I get the time. I get the amount.
MR. MILLER: Why the purpose.
JUSTICE BREYER: Explain to me why it is one of
the purposes for which those appropriations were made,
i.e., the equivalent of the $10 million, to go pay for
this.
MR. MILLER: Well, that's one of the things the
-- the Government and we agree upon.
JUSTICE BREYER: It was one of the purposes.
MR. MILLER: One of the purposes was paying
contracts, and that's because in this act, the
appropriation says here's $1.4 billion or $1.8 billion to
carry out the Indian Self-Determination Act. So that
satisfies the purpose test.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you think -- you
and the Government agree then that were this an ordinary
contract case, there is no doubt that a legally binding
contract would have been entered into and the clause,
subject to appropriations, would not work for the
Government.
MR. MILLER: That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you can't say that the
Government agrees to that. You certainly agree to it.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. Were it an ordinary --
MR. MILLER: The Government --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- were it an ordinary
contract.
MR. MILLER: In -- in the hypothetical.
No. I think the Government would agree that the
rule of Ferris and Blackhawk, the Dougherty rule from the
Court of Claims, 1983, all stand for the proposition when
you sign a contract with the Government and a lump sum
appropriation comes, it's not your job to start monitoring
Government operations and figuring out how much do they
want to boost their functions for this or that or the
other, and the --
JUSTICE BREYER: So our issue as far as you're
concerned -- and I'll ask the Government the same question
-- is, is this contract different from an ordinary
contract because of A, B, C, D Indian reservations, et
cetera? And your claim is, I can't find any difference.
And their claim is there will be some difference. Is that
right?
MR. MILLER: That is correct. They claim these
aren't contracts -- Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you did say the -- these
contracts were unique.
MR. MILLER: These contracts are unique. The
contracts in Winstar were unique. The contracts in the
United States v. New Mexico advance costs -- advance
funded cost reimbursable contracts. Many contracts are
unique. The question is whether the distinction makes a
difference in the law. The distinction here that these
are not procurement contracts, that can't be decisive.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the Government says it's
unique because the tribes are providing governmental
services. It doesn't really cite us a case where, say, a
city or a subdivision has sued under a contract.
MR. MILLER: But that's not unique either
because the -- the Government, the Department of Defense
in Iraq contracts out governmental services, the provision
of food to our troops in Iraq. That's a quintessential
governmental services, feeding the military. But they
contract it out. No one would suggest there that just
because it's a governmental service, it qualifies that
contract as a lesser contract than any other contract.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they didn't contract it
out to the government of Iraq. They contracted it out to
a private contractor.  I mean, what -- what makes this
unique is that the whole purpose of it was to give these
-- these tribes more governmental power, more self-
determination. The whole purpose was to enable the tribes
to act as governments.
MR. MILLER: Absolutely. And even Congress
considered --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's what makes it
different from private contracts --
MR. MILLER: We --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- even -- even with
Halliburton.
MR. MILLER: We --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, Halliburton is not an
Indian tribe and doesn't purport to be governing anybody.
MR. MILLER: We submit that that difference was
considered by Congress. In the 1988 amendments, there's
even language that says, we're thinking about maybe
calling this an intergovernmental agreement, but we've
decided to call it a contract because we want it to be
enforceable as a contract, just as other Government
contracts for goods and services are enforced. And that
was the language of the -- of the Senate report. They
then imposed the Contract Disputes Act and provided a
remedy in money damages. In those respects, along with
the canon of construction, we believe that these contracts
are fully enforceable for the stated contract amount.
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time,
Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.
Mr. Srinivasan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PARTIES
MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and
may it please the Court:
Apart from the roughly 2 percent of the annual
lump sum appropriation that the Secretary withheld for
performance of those core agency functions that the agency
itself was required to perform, the Secretary allocated
the entire remaining 98 percent of its lump sum
appropriation among tribes.
Now, the tribes have to point to some source of
funding within that lump sum appropriation.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, they just did, the 2
percent. So my question to you is the same. I asked,
let's imagine this had nothing to do with tribes, nothing
to do with it. It was a typical, ordinary Government
contract for pencils. All right? Or for soda water.
Now, and everything were the same. Under those
circumstances, just an ordinary contract -- and they point
to that 2 percent and they say that is legally speaking --
we didn't expect you to pay it. We just won a lawsuit in
the Court of Claims. But -- but we have -- we have a
contract here. Okay? That's what we're just saying. The
-- the subject to appropriation clause doesn't nix the
contract because that 2 percent is available, legally
speaking, time, purpose, and -- and amount. Okay?
Classic.
Now, what's the Government's view there?
MR. SRINIVASAN: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is it available or not were
this an ordinary contract?
MR. SRINIVASAN: No. With respect to the 2
percent that's reserved for inherent Federal functions,
that's not available.
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking -- all right. Are
-- is the Government's view then let's treat this just as
an ordinary contract? Still it -- there was no money
available.
MR. SRINIVASAN: With respect to --
JUSTICE BREYER: Legally speaking under the
time-purpose-amount test.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, Justice Breyer, I'm
drawing a distinction between the 2 percent that's
reserved for core agency functions and --
JUSTICE BREYER: No.
MR. SRINIVASAN: -- it's been a background
principle of Government contracting law that there are
certain core agency functions that -- that the Government
is required to perform for itself and that it can't
contract out. So I think that informs the interpretation
of the subject to availability clause.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I would like an answer to
my question, yes or no. If this were an ordinary contract
with a subject to appropriations clause, is -- would the
Government be saying this is invalid because the
appropriations were not there?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, you have to look at the
particular context.
JUSTICE BREYER: There must be a yes or no
answer to that.
MR. SRINIVASAN: It would be no if this
statutory regime governed, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: No. What it is is a contract
for pencils. Can you not -- is it impossible --
MR. SRINIVASAN: If -- if all --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- to make -- you see what I'm
driving --
MR. SRINIVASAN: If -- if all that's at issue is
a standard subject to availability clause in a contract
and there were no reduction clause, as there is in this
statute, and you're dealing with the standard procurement
context, then there is a Court of Claims decision, the
Blackhawk decision, that suggests, albeit in a footnote,
that in that situation, there are funds available in the
sense that they're legally unrestricted.
JUSTICE BREYER: Correct, and which are the
funds that are -- that would be available here? Which are
they?
MR. SRINIVASAN: There aren't any funds that are
available here in our view because --
JUSTICE BREYER: If this were under Blackhawk.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Under Blackhawk, it would be --
it would -- it would essentially affect the entire lump
sum appropriation because there's no legal requirement
that the lump sum appropriation be -- be directed in any
particular manner.
Now, there are some provisions in the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That includes the 2 percent
that you keep referring to.
MR. SRINIVASAN: That -- that would include in
the -- that would include the 2 percent.
But there are provisions, I should note
parenthetically, in the appropriations act that say
specifically, for example, that not to exceed a certain
amount is to be used for a particular function or at least
a certain amount is to be used, for example, for contract
health services. So you'd have to take into account --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then let me do this
then.
MR. SRINIVASAN: -- those particular provisos.
JUSTICE BREYER: You say if this were a classic,
ordinary contract, the money would have been available
legally speaking. Nobody says practically speaking, and
they could have brought their lawsuit. Now, tell me
specifically, if you can -- and this may take you the
whole time. You want to make whatever argument you want.
What is it that's special about this contract that brings
it out of ordinary contracting principles?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, first and foremost, the
text of the statute. If you look at page 15a of the
appendix to -- to the tribes' briefs, this isn't your
standard, garden variety subject to availability clause.
You have to look at the particular context in which this
statute --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the language is the
same.
MR. SRINIVASAN: It's not, Justice O'Connor,
with respect. It says, notwithstanding any other
provision -- and I'm reading at the bottom of page 15a --
the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to
the availability of appropriations and -- and this is --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That phrase is the same,
subject to the availability of appropriations.
MR. SRINIVASAN: That particular phrase
resembles the one that Justice Breyer posited in his
hypothetical.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Exactly.
MR. SRINIVASAN: But the term available -- and I
think this is critical. The term available is repeated in
what's been referred to as the reduction clause, and I
don't think one can understand what the term available
means unless it considers the meaning of that term
throughout that entire sentence.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but the other -- the
other side says you don't have to get to that because you
could have paid the contract amounts here without reducing
funds available for other tribes. It's simply that it
would have squeezed you in your budget, your -- your
headquarters operating budget for IHS. So they say, if I
understand them, that the -- that the nonreduction clause
doesn't save you here because you could have paid it
without reducing things for other tribes.
MR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I think that argument is
incorrect. First of all, it's an incorrect interpretation
of the terms of the reduction clause. But second of all,
the notion that funds for inherent Federal functions, the
2 percent that the agency reserved to perform its core
agency functions, were available for contracting is
contrary to -- to the terms of the ISDA itself. And if
you'll look at page 12a -- and I'm quoting from
450j-1(a)(1) -- what provision says is the amount of funds
provided under the terms of self-determination contracts
include the amount that the Secretary, quote, would have
otherwise provided. And then later on down in the
paragraph --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see that. Where?
MR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry. It's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not less. Right?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Shall not -- shall be not less
than the amount that the appropriate Secretary would have
otherwise provided.
And then further down in the paragraph in the
last -- in the last clause, including support of
administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.
And what otherwise contractable denotes is that there are
certain functions that are not otherwise contractable,
namely those core, inherent Federal functions that the
agency itself is required to provide. And so what 450j-
1(a) implements is the background understanding that funds
for core agency functions don't have to be turned over to
the contracting tribes because the agency requires those
funds in order to continue essentially to exist as a
Federal agency.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but I thought the
submission of the petitioners' counsel was that some of
these funds were used to monitor the contracts which are
functions the tribes could have performed. So is there a
factual disagreement here?
MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, Justice
Kennedy. I think it's more of a characterization
disagreement. There -- it's true that in a descriptive
sense, one might refer to some of these funds as used for
contract monitoring, but what 450j-1(a) says is that
whatever you might call it, the funds that are used for
core agency functions are outside the funds to be -- to be
turned over.
JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say that. It
doesn't say that. What it says is otherwise contractable.
And they could certainly -- for a lay person like me in
this, you'd think, well, we could have a provision that
says $180,000 is hereby authorized to be spent only for
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or Secretary of
Interior. Well, if it said that, then that's not
otherwise contractable because there's a statutory limit.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but --
JUSTICE BREYER: So otherwise contractable
sounds like a -- a statutory question.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- it's not talking
about money that's otherwise contractable. It says,
including supportive administrative functions that are
otherwise contractable. It's talking about a limitation
upon the contractability of functions --
MR. SRINIVASAN: Correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not the use of funds.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's talking about both
because the -- the first part of subparagraph (1) is the
amount of funds. It's relating to the amount of funds
that are required to be transferred, and what it stands
for is that funds for supportive administrative functions
that are not otherwise contractable, i.e., those core
agency functions that the agency is required to perform
itself, those funds aren't required to be turned over to
contracting tribes. And that just reflects the common
sense principle that the agency has to continue to exist
to perform some core functions.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how do you -- how do you
square that with the -- on page 14a -- reductions and, as
Mr. Miller read to us, shall not be reduced to make
funding available for contract managing -- monitoring or
administration by the Secretary, shall not be reduced by
the Secretary to pay for Federal functions, including but
not limited to, and then a string of what I assume falls
under the heading Federal functions.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Ginsburg, the way we
square that under the statute is that the leading -- the
initial sentence in subsection (b) says the amount of
funds required by subsection (a) of this section. And our
view of the statute is that funds for inherent Federal
functions were never required to be transferred under
subsection (a) to begin with. And so what (b) deals with
is the funds that are left over after the funds for
inherent Federal functions are taken off the top.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So are these noninherent
Federal functions shall not be reduced to pay for Federal
functions? So there's inherent Federal functions and
noninherent?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Oh, absolutely there are. The
Federal functions is the broader set of -- it could
essentially encompass everything the Federal Government
does. Inherent Federal functions refers to that core set
of functions that the agency itself is required to
perform. And the distinction between inherent Federal
functions and Federal functions, although it might seem
trivial as a semantic matter, is reflected in fact in the
definitions in title V of the ISDA where it specifically
defines inherent Federal functions as a subset of Federal
functions.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Does it ever define them as
noncontractable? I mean, I -- I -- your answer, I
suppose, is well, what -- what do you think they're
talking about, but does it ever expressly get to --
MR. SRINIVASAN: It -- it does.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the point of
contractability?
MR. SRINIVASAN: It does, Justice Scalia --
Justice Souter. Excuse me.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Thank you, but apologize to
him.
(Laughter.)
MR. SRINIVASAN: And we describe the -- the
relevant provision in our brief, if you'll bear with me
for just one second, on page 31. When Congress enacted
the title IV self-governance provisions that relate to the
BIA -- and this is at the beginning of the first partial
paragraph that begins with of particular significance.
There's a provision there, 25 U.S.C. 458cc(k). And the
provision reads that nothing in this section is intended
or shall be construed to expand or alter existing
statutory authorities so as to authorize the Secretary to
enter into any agreement with respect to functions that
are inherently Federal. And I think what that signifies
is that there are some functions that are not contractable
and can't be turned over to the tribes.
JUSTICE BREYER: That -- that all may be true,
of course. They're talking about don't contract out to
the Indians something that should be done in Washington.
But what has that got to do with the issue? We're
talking, I thought, about -- about Government contracts.
People who enter into Government contracts need certainty.
They have to know whether that word, subject to
appropriations, invalidates the contract or whether they
have a valid contract. And a set of principles have come
up that are used to decide that. And under that set of
principles, money is available to pay for the contract if
it's time, purpose, and amount. Okay? That's the
principle. And --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You don't think --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and I don't see anything
contrary to that.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Breyer, one background
principle -- and it's reflected, by the way, in the terms
of the contracts themselves. One background principle is
that funds for inherent Federal functions are not required
to be transferred to tribes. And the contracts --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Srinivasan, do you
say that the contracts that were entered into by IHS and
the tribes did somehow contract away Federal -- inherent
Federal functions?
MR. SRINIVASAN: No. They specifically --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: They didn't violate that
section, did they? The contracts that we're talking
about.
MR. SRINIVASAN: They specifically did not
transfer --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: No. So we're not dealing
with that. We're dealing with contracts that didn't
violate that section. And you're just saying that some of
the lump sum appropriation was diverted by the Government
to pay for some kind of core Federal function, not that
the contracts violated that provision.
MR. SRINIVASAN: No. The -- that's correct,
Justice O'Connor. What I'm responding to is the
suggestion that funds that were allocated by the Secretary
to pay for inherent Federal functions were required to be
diverted to pay for the indirect costs --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're not saying -- you're
addressing not what was contracted out, but what funds are
available.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's where your argument is
going.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Correct. It relates to the
funds that are available.
And the tribes' position --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you rely on the statement
in (a) that the -- the only funds that are available are
funds that include funds to -- to pay for supportive
administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. Not funds --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And not funds that are used to
pay for administrative functions that are not
contractable.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. We think that funds for
inherent Federal functions were taken off -- off the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You said that --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you sort of a basic
question that I'm having trouble following? As I
understand, you're saying 98 percent of the appropriation
have been allocated to programs, projects, activities, and
so forth that can't be reduced. Now, is there anything in
the statute that would have prevented the Secretary from
allocating only 96 percent of the budget to those funds?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, there is, Justice
Stevens, in the following sense. It's not at all the case
that the Secretary had unfettered discretion in composing
the allocation scheme in any fiscal year.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But his budget that he
actually worked out with the 98 percent was not mandated
by the statute, as I understand.
MR. SRINIVASAN: In -- in part it was mandated
by the statute.
JUSTICE STEVENS: In part but not in whole.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Perhaps not in whole --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's the point.
MR. SRINIVASAN: -- but at least in significant
part. And let me -- but I think this is significant, and
if I can just walk the Court through the process by which
the budget is developed and any appropriation ultimately
is allocated.
The Secretary has always, both before the ISDA
and after the ISDA, taken the current year's allocation
across programs as a given, as a baseline from which the
next year's allocation will be built. And that's
reflected in the terms of the statute on pages 14a to 15a
of the appendix to the blue brief. There's a provision,
450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred
to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in
subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited
criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is
the reduction in appropriations. But we're not dealing
with that in the relevant fiscal years. There was always
an increase. And so the Secretary, pursuant to the
statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at
the level that it was at the previous fiscal year.
Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds
two -- two considerations on top. The first is mandatory
across-the-board increases for things such as salary
COLA's and inflationary adjustments. And that's a
standard feature of budgeting, and it's reflected again in
the terms of the statute. And that -- I'd point the Court
to page 9 of the Government's brief, the gray brief, where
we cite a provision, 25 U.S.C. 1680a.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is the -- is the nub of what
you're trying to tell me is that the 98 percent was, in
fact, mandated by a statute?
MR. SRINIVASAN: It was -- I -- I think in
principal part it was mandated by the -- by --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Principal part, but --
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, let --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean that there was
not enough?
MR. SRINIVASAN: At least as far --
JUSTICE STEVENS: They could have made it 97
percent --
MR. SRINIVASAN: -- insofar as what I've said
with respect --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- and had enough money --
MR. SRINIVASAN: Sorry.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- to pay these contract
obligations.
MR. SRINIVASAN: No, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: See, the thing that troubles
me is it seems to me your reading of the statute makes the
contractual problem -- provision illusory because they can
always allocate funds to all these other projects and say,
well, we've already used up the money.
MR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't think that they
have discretion to do that. And that's what I'm trying to
explain. At least with respect to the existing baseline
and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated
by the statute that the -- that the Secretary conduct his
budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done.
With respect to the mandatory across-the-board
increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U.S.C.
1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the
administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires
the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for,
quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote,
other expenses relating to the provision of health
services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such
funds are provided to programs and services operated
directly. In other words, with respect to mandatory
across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate
those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non-
contracting tribes.
And that leaves the additional set of an
increase from one year to the next year that deals with
specific targeted items, and principally that would
include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come
on board during the course of a particular fiscal year.
And with respect to those specific targeted items, the
critical point is that the contracting tribes often
benefit from the addition of those and from the
enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks.
For example, in this particular case, the -- one
of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic
in Oklahoma. That was a new facility that came on board
in the early 1990s and for which the -- for which the
Cherokee Nation assumed administration of it through a
self-determination agreement. Now, the staffing for that
facility was specifically earmarked in the Secretary's
budget submissions and in -- in Congress' appropriation
committee reports. And it, of course, is in the Cherokee
Nation's interest to ensure that those earmarks are
honored.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you telling me that the
committee reports are -- are binding law?
MR. SRINIVASAN: They're not binding law,
Justice Stevens. We fully recognize that. But at the
same time, I don't think that what Congress intended to do
was to require the Secretary to completely ignore the
committee reports.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But you got a conflict
apparently between the committee reports and what seems to
be pretty clear law, which says we're going to treat these
contracts as contracts, not as intergovernmental
agreements. And in -- in that conflict, I don't see why
contracting principles don't trump the committee reports.
MR. SRINIVASAN: It's not just the committee
reports, Justice Souter. It's the reduction clause. The
reduction clause is a part of the statute and no one has
ever suggested the reduction clause doesn't inform the
proper interpretation of the contract.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and their -- their
argument is that you can pay the contract amount without
robbing other tribes of the amounts that the -- that the
nonreduction clause refers to. They are saying -- I think
they're saying, look, you, the governmental bureaucracy,
get squeezed. Yes. And if so, the contract comes first
and you have to live with the squeeze and go back to
Congress and say, we're doing what you told us and we're
getting squeezed out of existence. I think that's what
they're saying.
MR. SRINIVASAN: That is what they're saying,
Justice Souter, but with respect to, I think it's
incorrect. The Government bureaucracy consists of two
separate types of bureaucracy. There's that core
bureaucracy that is the inherent Federal functions. And
one of their arguments is that the Secretary was required
to divest himself of the funds that were necessary to
perform those functions.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, he's not. But if -- if --
where I'm really coming from, to be honest -- and I'd like
-- you might as well reply to what I'm actually -- is why
I'm asking these slightly hostile questions.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I read here -- look, the
question really is was this money like the bureaucracy
money. Is it legally speaking an appropriation available,
not practically speaking but legally? And here it seems
to me, in looking through this somewhat quickly, that you
say no, but the Board of Contract Appeals say yes. And so
I think in my mind, you know, one group of people who
really know about this is the Board of Contract Appeals.
So if they're saying that money from a contract point -- a
point of normal contract law is legally available, I
promise you I'm predisposed to think they're right. So I
might as well expose that to you so you can tell me now
why I'm wrong or they're wrong or whatever.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Because, Justice Breyer, I
think the core of it is that even if you think that
they're right, that these funds are legally available,
that's not enough under the ISDA because the ISDA
specifically reserves to the Secretary the discretion that
he not be required to reduce funding for programs,
projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make
funds available to another tribe under this subchapter.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is -- is -- the
kind -- the money that's available to one tribe can't be
taken for the other. But I thought the Board of Contract
Appeals was saying taking that into account, there's still
enough money left over. Am I wrong about that? I thought
you should take money from one tribe to give it to
another. What did they think?
MR. SRINIVASAN: No. They thought -- the -- the
board -- the Federal Circuit at least, which echoed the
Board of Contract Appeals, thought --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm thinking the Board of
Contract Appeals and the Federal Circuit.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't think the Board
of -- of Contract Appeals really wrestled directly with
where the funds were coming from. They just thought that
legal availability would be sufficient.
Now, what the Federal Circuit said was that
funds for inherent Federal functions are available. And
we think that's wrong for the reasons I've said. I don't
think those funds ever came into the group of funds that
were subject to be transferred to begin with. But even if
you thought that they did, I think it's clear that funds
for inherent Federal functions are funds for programs,
projects, or activities serving a tribe in the sense that
one example of a core Federal function --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but if that's true, then
everything -- then every penny in the -- in the IHS
bureaucracy qualifies. I mean, that swallows the -- that
swallows the entire budget.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, let's -- Justice Souter,
if I -- if I could, let's look at the particular
sources --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, no. But I mean, just
conceptually isn't that -- isn't that the -- the
implication of what you're saying?
JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you can't limit it to
inherent Government functions. Both the inherent and the
noninherent Government functions would fall within this
provision --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you read it as broadly as
you've just read it.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I -- I guess the way I'd
like to make the point is to say that the sources of funds
that they point to, which include inherent Federal
functions and the -- the noninherent Federal function
bureaucracy that supports the administration of programs
that serve tribes that are directly served by the Federal
Government, those two are in fact programs, projects, or
activities serving a tribe.
With respect to the administrative support --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: On -- on that point -- on
that point, in the Federal Circuit Judge Dyke expressed
considerable displeasure with the Government because he
said three times I said, tell me what existing programs
with other tribes would have been reduced if these
contract support costs are paid in full. And he said, I
asked them again and again and again, and they were
unresponsive. So since the Government declined to tell
the court what programs -- existing programs with other
tribes would have been reduced, mustn't we assume, as I
think the Federal Circuit did, that the proof is
unavailable and no existing program with other tribes
would have been diminished?
MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't -- I don't think so,
Justice Ginsburg. I mean, one straightforward reason why
you don't have to take that assumption is that it's not
only the Federal Circuit case that's before the Court,
it's also the Tenth Circuit case. And there's -- there
are declarations in the Tenth Circuit case that
specifically assert that diverting funding for -- to pay
for the contract support costs of these tribes would have
required reducing funds for programs, projects, or
activities serving a tribe.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, what does that mean?
MR. SRINIVASAN: So --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, one thing is existing
contracts, things that are already ongoing, and then
another thing is, well, we think that there's a new
program that could be good for some tribe. So we're going
to put that new program in and say that that steps in
front of these contract support costs. Are we talking
just about existing programs that -- that the Government
has made a commitment to, or are we saying the Government
is at liberty to benefit tribes? And so what if the
contract support costs are, as a result, diminished?
We're still doing good for tribes.
MR. SRINIVASAN: We're talking about both
existing programs and new programs, and with respect to
new programs, there's -- it's every bit as likely that
those new programs would benefit contracting tribes as
noncontracting tribes. And again, one of the new
facilities --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's strange to talk of
reducing -- is -- is not required to reduce funding for a
new program. I mean, for a new program, there isn't any
funding. How can you reduce the funding for a new
program?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That provision makes sense with
regard to existing programs, but it doesn't make any sense
with regard to proposed programs.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't think that reduce
necessarily takes the existing year's appropriation as the
baseline. We think that what it takes as the baseline is
the current year's appropriation allocation which takes
into account increases. And one way to see that is 25
U.S.C. 1680a, which is the provision that I cited earlier
that requires the Secretary to apportion mandatory across-
the-board increases on a proportionate basis as between
contracted programs and noncontracted programs. And what
that provision means is that the reduction takes into
account those mandatory across-the-board increases from
year to year. So in some sense, I think reduce does mean
this year's allocation of appropriations as opposed to
last year's spending amount.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Srinivasan, you -- you
alluded a moment ago in -- in answering Justice Ginsburg,
I guess, to declarations on file on the Tenth Circuit case
that -- that specifically said we would have to reduce
funds available for other programs. Did those
declarations get specific in the way that her original
question was -- was asking about? Did it say -- did the
declarations say we will have to reduce the X program for
the Navajo Tribe and the Y program for the Apache Tribe
and so on, or was it -- did the declarations simply say,
as a general matter, we would have to reduce allocations
for other tribes?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, they -- they make the
point as a general matter, and they also give an example.
I think the one example that they give -- and maybe there
are more -- is -- is a diabetes program. But I think it's
more the general principle --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that a new program or an
existing program?
MR. SRINIVASAN: That's an -- the -- the
particular example is an existing program. But I think
it's more --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me you can
interpret those comments as saying we don't -- they did
not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we
now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.
MR. SRINIVASAN: You're -- you're speaking with
particular respect to the new programs, Justice Stevens?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. It seems to me that you
can interpret what you're saying as the -- as the -- the
Government adopting a budget in which there's not enough
room for all the programs it wants to support in the
current year and continuing to honor the obligations under
the existing contracts.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't think that even
with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough
money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract
support costs. If you look at the figures, the shortfall
in contract support costs, for example, in 1997
cumulatively was $82 million, and that's -- that is more
than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996
to FY 1997. It's more than the amount that was reserved
by the Government for inherent Federal functions. And so
even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be
sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is there some way to avoid
these problems now? Has anything changed?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice O'Connor, Congress
changed things by imposing a statutory cap, explicit
statutory cap, on contract support cost funding beginning
with 1998. It had done so since 1994 for the BIA and it
did so beginning in 1998 with respect to IHS.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why was there that difference
between the BIA that got the statutory caps earlier and
not till, was it, 4 years later for the IHS?
MR. SRINIVASAN: I think the difference lies in
the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall.
My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in
BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become
evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond.
And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the
two.
But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in
the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the
1999 Appropriations Act. And I think, if nothing else,
section 314 at list -- at least expresses the view of a
subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme
from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his
discretion under the ISDA. And under this Court's
decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination
by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great
weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately
exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997. So even if you
thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary
had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA,
I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation
Act that its view was that Secretary had done so
legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our
favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA.
I want to address really quickly, if I could,
the notion that the funds for administrative support for
programs that are administered directly by the Federal
Government are available. And that would have significant
consequences because one of the policies underlying the
act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that
are currently entered into self-determination contracts,
but it's to protect the amounts that are available to
tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-
determination contracts. And if, under the tribes' view,
the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of
the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes
or to -- to divert the entire amount of administrative
support for -- for noncontracted programs to contracting
tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the
amounts that were available for potentially contracting
tribes in future years.
Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Miller, you have about 4
minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LLOYD B. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF THE CHEROKEE NATION
AND SHOSHONE-PAIUTE TRIBES
MR. MILLER: Justice Stevens, thank you.
First, I'd like to address the availability of
appropriations clause briefly. That is a term of art with
a well-established meaning. This Court in Morissette said
that if -- unless there's a contrary direction from
Congress that the term of art should not be given its
well-established meaning, it controls. And that is the
meaning, purpose, time, and amount, that the appropriation
is available for the purpose during the time and in the
amounts necessary to fully --
JUSTICE BREYER: I think they disagree with you
about the purpose in respect to the core Government
function.
MR. MILLER: Secondly, with regard to the core
governmental functions, in Blackhawk, the contractor had a
settlement with the Veterans Administration. The Veterans
Administration had to reprogram. From where? We don't
know, but the Veterans Administration had to reprogram and
wanted to get approval from the Congress for that
reprogramming action. Congress then stepped in but after
the payment was due and forbade any reprogramming, and the
Court then held when the payment was due, money was
legally available and it doesn't matter where it comes
from. There is no protection for inherent Federal
functions. It may have come from some other hospital
budget. It may have come from some other activity of the
Veterans Administration. No doubt everything the VA does
is important, but it doesn't mean it didn't have a legal
obligation to pay the contract. There is no rule that has
an IFF exception to the governmental duty to pay, and if
there was, it would upset Government contract law deeply
as the amicus brief from the National Chamber explains.
Secondly, when funds are not available, we know
what happens. This Court's decision, Justice Brandeis'
decision for the Court, in Sutton explains what happens
when funds are not available. There was a line item
appropriation of $20,000 for a construction project. We
understand that the contractor was on notice. Everything
is square.
Here, the entire lump sum appropriation was
available, and I'd like to give the Court a sense of where
the money could have come from, not that the Government
had to do it. Just as in Blackhawk, if they chose not to
reprogram, that's their right. But then there's a remedy.
Where could the money have come from?
In 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in
a shortfall, just to the Cherokee contractor.  No other
contractor was apparently shorted. There was up to $98
million in leftover appropriations that year. There was
55 -- $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in
increase every year from $36 million to $88 million.
There was $25 million in inherent Federal functions. They
couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this
contractor? Not that they had to. They could have taken
some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some
of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at
headquarters and area offices. That was their decision.
But the contractor didn't take the risk that the
Secretary would say, at the end of the day, I've decided
to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by
golly, there's nothing left for you. No contractor takes
that risk in dealing with the Government, and surely, a
tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in
the statute doesn't take that risk either.
There is no limitation to the Secretary's theory
in this case. The Secretary's theory means that we come,
the contractors come, after the allocation of the
Secretary. Well, the Secretary could, in a reduction
year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the
contracts and enhance even his own Federal bureaucracy and
programs serving other tribes and say, now I've made my
decision and I've made my judgment. I don't have enough
money to pay you. There's no limit here on contract
support costs. It could be the secretarial amount. They
could zero out these contracts and say it's practical
availability. And we've decided there isn't enough money
to deal with all of the health care needs in the country,
so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you
come last. Now, that's not what the -- that's not what
the statute permits. That sort of interpretation would
lead to an absurdity.
With regard to the Tenth Circuit decision,
Justice, you asked a question about the declarations in
the Tenth Circuit. There was a declaration in the Tenth
Circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to
have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in
programs serving other tribes. Now, that is not
sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's
certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary
judgment.
So for all these reasons, we believe the Tenth
Circuit decision should be reversed and the Federal
Circuit decision affirmed.
Unless the Court has more questions.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Miller.
MR. MILLER: Thank you, Justice Stevens.
