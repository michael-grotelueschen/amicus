CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument first
in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California. Mr. Gold.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GOLD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
The procedure for imposing aggravated sentences
under California's Determinate Sentencing Law implicates
the bright line rule this Court set forth in Blakely and
Apprendi. Any fact other than the fact of a prior
conviction which increases the penalty for a crime beyond
the prescribed statutory maximum must be proved to a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt.
The primary point of contention in this case is
what constitutes the statutory maximum under California's
Determinate Sentencing Law. Petitioner believes that
it's the middle term, whereas respondent maintains that
it's the upper term.
In fact, this case really boils down to just one
question. Can a judge in California legally impose an
upper term sentence based solely on the facts reflected
in the jury's verdict or the defendant's admissions. The
answer to this question is no. California's Determinate
Sentencing Law specifies three possible prison terms for
each -- for each felony conviction, a lower term, a
middle term, and an upper term, although it mandates that
judges shall impose the middle term unless there are
factors of aggravation or mitigation. California case
law confirms that judges must impose the middle term
where there are no aggravating factors, and even the
state appears to concede the point.
Because the middle term is the greatest
punishment a judge can impose based solely on the facts
reflected in the jury's verdict, it, and not the upper
term, constitutes the statutory maximum for --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gold, I know you take that
position on the facts of this case, but is it not true
that there could be cases in which the verdict of the
jury would establish certain facts that would justify
going beyond the middle term? For example, the Black
case itself, as the justice who dissented in this case
thought the sentence was permissible in that case.
MR. GOLD: Your Honor, Justice Stevens, to the
extent that a fact is found by the jury which can be used
as an aggravating factor, but is not an element of the
crime or found by the jury as an enhancement, that could
be used to impose an upper term sentence. Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Would it always, then, be
surplusage in the indictment when a fact is charged and
subsequently found by a jury, is it always a surplus
fact? Because otherwise -- I mean, what I'm getting at
is, otherwise, one assumes it would be a way of stating
an element of the offense, and as I understand it, under
California law, the element of the offense couldn't
satisfy the additional fact necessary to jump up to the
higher range.
MR. GOLD: Yes, Your Honor. I mean, typically
under California law, in the information, they allege the
crime, and on occasion, some of the elements. But
typically not all of the elements.
JUSTICE SOUTER: If in this case, the indictment
had charged -- had claimed that the defendant was the
father of the victim, would that have satisfied at least
the fact-finding for the aggravator of being in a
position of trust?
MR. GOLD: Well, Your Honor, the fact that the
information would have alleged that does not mean that
the jury would have found that fact, because just because
-- what is alleged in the indictment or in the
information --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That depends on the instructions.
MR. GOLD: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: If the instructions said, you
know, you've got to find all of the things that are set
out in the information, and the jury returned a verdict,
then we would have found -- and that would satisfy the
requirement of an additional fact on an element.
MR. GOLD: I believe so, Justice Souter.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be an erroneous
instruction, I assume.
MR. GOLD: Yes, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You either have to have an
erroneous instruction or a special verdict.
MR. GOLD: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Only in the sense that it would
require the state to prove more than it had to prove for
the elements of the crime.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. GOLD: Yes, Justice Souter, and I agree that
it would be no different than submitting aggravating
factors as a separate allegation to the jury as a
separate instruction.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the thing that
concerns me about your case is that California's system
looks a lot like the Federal system after Booker. We
haven't addressed the issue or had a case involving
review of reasonableness for upward departure. But at
least as the circuits have said it, in a federal case,
the district judge imposes a maximum, doesn't give any
reason for departing from what the guidelines might
suggest is a reasonable middle ground, he may be -- I
think in most circuits, that would be reversed.
Same here. If a California judge imposes the
upper tier but doesn't make any findings, that's going to
be reversed. But if a federal judge gives a statement of
his reasons, you know, a vulnerable victim, or an
offender likely to offend again, whatever, under most
circuit law, that's going to be upheld.
Here, if the California judge does that, that's
going to be still struck down under your view. You
talked about Blakely and Apprendi. But how does this
system look to you under Booker?
MR. GOLD: Well, Your Honor, this system really is
-- this is just like -- this case is just like Blakely.
What the California Supreme Court in People against Black
found, they used references to reasonableness as a label
and a characterization to avoid the bright line rule of
Blakely and Apprendi.
Instead they tried to fit the Determinate
Sentencing Law within the Federal system this Court found
constitutional in Booker. But the California Supreme
Court seriously misread Booker. In Booker, in the
remedial portion of that decision, this Court found the
Federal system to be constitutional by rendering the
guidelines -- the mandatory guidelines to be advisory.
Now --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under California, they're
advisory anyway. I mean, even if the judge makes the
necessary finding to get up into the higher tier, he
doesn't have to impose the higher sentence, he can impose
the lower one.
MR. GOLD: Mr. Chief Justice, no. He has to
impose the middle term. He can't deviate --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is if he makes a
finding that justifies going up to the higher term, 16
years in this case, he doesn't have to impose that higher
term, he can go back to the middle term.
MR. GOLD: No, no, you are absolutely right. He
has discretion not to do that.
JUSTICE BREYER: But does it say that the only
basis for a judge reasonably imposing the higher term is
that the judge has found a fact that the jury didn't
find.
MR. GOLD: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: It does say that? As I read the
California opinion, they can go up above the lower, the
middle term for any reason, but it has to be reasonable.
MR. GOLD: Your Honor, what this -- what the
California Supreme Court did, in this --
JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe that's hard to justify in
terms of California's statute, but we take the California
Supreme Court's interpretation of that statute as the law
of California. So what is the answer to my question as
you read Black?
MR. GOLD: The answer to your question is that
Black has made no change whatsoever to the mandatory
nature of California's Determinate Sentencing Law, and it
has always operated in a mandatory way.
JUSTICE BREYER: I think -- let me give
you --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think your answer would be that
how could it possibly be reasonable except for the
consideration of some additional fact? What makes it
reasonable other than facts? Atmosphere? I mean --
JUSTICE BREYER: If that is your answer, my
example will be -- I'll give you a specific example.
One example is the question of consecutive versus
concurrent sentences, which may have very little to do
with facts.
A second example might be that a judge in a
particular community says there's been an unbelievable
rash of breaking and entering. I see how the writers of
this guideline, of the statute that embodies it, thought
--
that breaking and entering was X, occurred with X
frequency, but we have in this community a sudden rash of
crime, such that I think the reasonable thing to do is to
increase the sentence as a deterrent.
Now, suppose that's what he writes. And is there
anything in California law, as you understand Black, that
makes that unlawful?
MR. GOLD: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: What?
MR. GOLD: I believe that the statements in Black
JUSTICE BREYER: Which statements make that
unlawful?
MR. GOLD: Your Honor, in Black, the California
Supreme Court repeatedly stated that the way the system
works in California is that it is a mandatory system. So
as an example, at 35 Cal.4th 1254, the court stated, "the
court cannot impose the upper term unless there is at
least one aggravating factor." At 1260, the court said,
"in a case in which no aggravating factor can be found,
the judge cannot impose the upper term."
There are a number of statements throughout the
Black opinion that indicate the system has never changed
from a mandatory one to an advisory one, so that
reasonableness is not the issue. Whether the system is
mandatory or advisory --
JUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, when they say
mandatory factor, they mean aggravating factor, they mean
to exclude the kind of aggravating factor I just
mentioned.
MR. GOLD: Well, a judge can consider those
aggravating factors.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, could he? Could the judge
consider the fact that I just mentioned, that there's
been an extraordinary rash of breaking and entering in
the vicinity?
MR. GOLD: Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes or no?
MR. GOLD: Well, under California's law, they have
-- in addition to factors relating to the crime and
factors relating to the defendant, the judge can consider
unenumerated factors.
JUSTICE BREYER: Unenumerated factors. So mine
would be an unenumerated factor.
MR. GOLD: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If he can consider
unenumerated factors -- now, I purposely picked mine
because I take it it is an example of a factor that
Apprendi would not require a jury to find.
It is a factor about the community. It is not a
factor about this defendant. It is not a factor about
the manner in which this defendant committed the crime.
It is not a fact of that kind.
MR. GOLD: Your Honor, I'm not sure whether that
sort of factor would be upheld as a --
JUSTICE BREYER: But if it were reasonable, it
would be upheld, or not?
MR. GOLD: If it was found to be a decision that
was reasonably related to the crime -- I'm sorry, to the
decision being made by the judge, then yes, it would be
upheld as a valid aggravating factor. But I believe that
it would still need to be then, if it would be considered
a valid aggravating factor, then it would need to be
tried by the jury.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I clarify one thing? You
mean that a rash of crimes committed by people other than
the defendant could be an aggravating factor?
MR. GOLD: Your Honor, under California law, I'm
not saying that that would be upheld as a valid reason.
I'm just --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But there's nothing in
California law suggesting that that would be upheld, is
there?
MR. GOLD: No, Justice Stevens, there is not.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So you draw -- as I understand
it, your basic answer to Justice Breyer is, it may well
be that the situation in the community may justify a
judge in going to the -- to the high end of the range
that is possible, but that is not a factor that
determines what range is possible. And the fact that
determines what range is possible is an aggravating fact,
and in that respect, it is different from the Federal
system. Is that --
MR. GOLD: That's absolutely right, Justice
Souter.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand it. If he
does -- tell me again, would you? I thought your
response was going to be what Justice -- who suggested
(Laughter).
JUSTICE SCALIA: Somebody on that side suggested
it. That to talk about the fact that there's a lot of
crime in the community as an aggravating factor doesn't
make any sense. Aggravating factor means something that
makes the crime that this person committed worse, not the
need for punishment greater, but makes the crime worse.
Now, if that is not your answer, what is the answer that
you gathered, from the left of me?
MR. GOLD: Well, with all due respect to Justice
Breyer, I believe that that probably would not be an
aggravating factor that would be upheld under California
law. I was just trying to make the distinction between
whether an aggravating factor, no matter what it is,
whether it is considered reasonable, whether that's
enough to get the judge to go beyond the statutory
maximum. But --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought your position was that
aggravation must be reasonable. What the court in Black
indicates is that it is not going to consider anything
reasonable unless there's a fact to support it, unless
there's a finding of fact to support it. Is that the
position you take?
MR. GOLD: The position as far as what Black is
saying?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. GOLD: Yes. I think Black -- what Black is
saying is that an aggravating factor needs to be
reasonable, but I was trying to make the distinction --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I think that there's the
further indication that it is not going to be deemed
reasonable unless it is supported by a finding of fact,
as indicated in order to support one of the specific
guideline aggravators.
MR. GOLD: Certainly if the aggravating factor is
not supported by the evidence, then it won't be
considered reasonable and the imposition of a upper term
won't be considered reasonable. But --
JUSTICE ALITO: I still don't understand the
distinction between the California system and a system of
advisory guidelines with reasonableness appellate review.
Let's take a hypothetical case where the statutory range
after convictions on multiple counts is zero to a hundred
years. And let's say you have two judges who have these
cases. And one sentences the defendant to zero,
probation. The other one sentences the defendant to a
hundred years.
Without saying a word of explanation for either
sentence, isn't the appellate court in that situation
going to say, you have to tell us why you have chosen
zero or why you have chosen 100? And if the trial judge
provides an explanation, isn't the trial judge
necessarily going to be reciting certain facts that the
judge believes to be true about the offense and the
offender?
MR. GOLD: Your Honor, if you're describing the
Federal system or just a hypothetical system, my
understanding in a indeterminate type of system, a judge
can impose whatever sentence he wants. And whether or
not in a particular system, that will be reviewed for
reasonableness is a separate question as to what he --
JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't it reviewed for
reasonableness -- isn't the reasonableness review
necessarily going to require what is, in essence,
fact-finding by the trial judge, and a review of the
reasonableness of the sentence in light of those facts by
an appellate court?
MR. GOLD: Yes, Your Honor. But what -- in
Booker, what made the Federal system constitutional was
not the engraftment of the reasonableness review. It was
rendering the mandatory guidelines advisory. And that's
the aspect of California's Supreme Court Black decision
that they've misread the Booker decision.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is that, why is that so?
Why isn't the middle sentence, just like what the
guideline -- what the guideline would indicate? And if a
Federal court would say, if I sentence within the
guideline, that will be presumptively valid, as many
courts have held. Not this Court yet. That would be
presumptively valid.
And if I go outside, I have to give a reason that
will survive appellate review. Well, why isn't the
middle sentence identical in function to the Federal
sentencing guidelines advice?
MR. GOLD: Justice Ginsburg, I think that it's the
mandatory nature in California of the middle term. The
judge cannot exceed the middle term unless he finds at
least one aggravating factor. And my understanding in
the Federal system is that the judge can exceed the --
can exceed these guideline ranges and that they're just
advisory.
JUSTICE SCALIA: To say that a sentence within the
guideline range is reasonable is not to say that a
sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable. So
under the Federal system, it is perfectly possible --
unless, unless we hold otherwise -- for a judge to give a
sentence beyond the guideline range, and nonetheless to
be affirmed, because although the guideline range is
reasonable, there are other systems that would be
reasonable, right?
MR. GOLD: Yes, Your -- Justice Scalia. And I
think that to the extent that we are going to say that
any sentence outside this guideline range is going to be
unreasonable and necessarily require reversal is going to
be no different than the mandatory guideline system this
Court struck down in Booker itself.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the only part of the
California system that creates a problem is this -- the
one sentence in the statute that says the judge shall
impose the middle term unless he makes a finding.
MR. GOLD: That's absolutely right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if we rule in your
favor, the great benefit for criminal defendants in
California will be that judges can now depart without
making a particular finding, they can increase the
sentence even though they do not find an aggravator
within the limits of the California system.
MR. GOLD: But Mr. Chief Justice, it is not clear
that that would be the result in California. The
legislature could very well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't the decision in
Black suggest the Supreme Court thinks that would be the
result? The California Supreme Court?
MR. GOLD: I'm not sure that they think that that
would be the result. They certainly did not make an
attempt to reform or rewrite the statute so that it was
now an advisory system.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought that -- it
looked to me that's what they were trying to do in Black.
I mean, in a way, it is kind of the -- the Black opinion,
the day after, if this Court were to agree with you, and
the California Supreme Court issued a decision looking a
lot like its decision in Black, that would be perfectly
valid.
In other words, saying that judges can depart
within this whole -- just like Booker, they can depart
within this whole range, and we're going to review their
determinations for reasonableness. They don't have to
impose the middle sentence, they can impose a higher
sentence, and we will review it for reasonableness. That
would be perfectly all right.
MR. GOLD: Well, and that may very well be the
case, but that's not what the California Supreme Court
did in Black. They made no attempt. What they did was
described the Determinate Sentencing Law as it has always
operated. And at no time did they purport to change the
law in California, including the mandatory nature of the
Determinate Sentencing Law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what they said was
judges can impose a sentence in either of the three --
any one of the three tiers, and we are going to review it
for reasonableness. And if they don't make findings, it
is going to be unreasonable, right?
MR. GOLD: Yes, but once again, the reasonableness
aspect is not what makes the system constitutional. It
is the mandatory versus advisory aspect. And again,
that's what made the Federal system constitutional based
on this Court's Booker decision. It wasn't this
engraftment of reason -- reviewing these sentences for
reasonableness.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, to be quite -- to expose my
thinking on it, I found it rather ambiguous, pages 1260
and 1261. Is that what -- the first part of that is --
it says what you said. I have no doubt. It says just
what you said.
But then you get over to the part, the discussion
of Booker, and when they start talking about Booker, they
seem to say, seem to say, that they're adopting what
Booker says. Now, if they are adopting what Booker says,
that means, and that's why I used my example, that I
guess a judge would have the power, if it is reasonable,
to just say the guideline, though it says thus and so,
isn't right for my circumstance. And therefore, I don't
adopt it. And that would be reviewed for reasonableness,
his decision not to follow it.
And similarly, we have cases, for example, where
they're trying to construct a sentence and they can't get
it right because of the consecutive/concurrent nature, so
he adds a few things on, you see, to the sentence, in
order -- and then makes them concurrent. Or you could
have things where it is a very sophisticated conspiracy,
and the jury found the conspiracy. It is a
characterization of a conspiracy, it is very
sophisticated.
And I thought, well, maybe all three of those are
reasons for going up in California. And I read those
pages, 1260, 1261, and my honest opinion is I'm not sure.
MR. GOLD: Well, Your Honor, I have no doubt that
the California Supreme Court was trying to fit the
Determinate Sentencing Law within the constitutionality
of this Court's Booker system. But as far as 1261, I'm
looking -- every single time they talk about Booker or
reasonableness, they also make sure to give the -- to
make sure that they make clear that the way the
sentence -- the system works is that there's still this
requirement of finding an aggravating factor.
JUSTICE BREYER: An aggravating factor means
aggravating fact.
MR. GOLD: Aggravating fact, uh -- yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would you think would be
necessary, what would be the least change California
would have to make to bring its system into compliance
with our decisions?
MR. GOLD: Justice Ginsburg, the court could --
the court or the legislature could change section 1170(b)
to read something like: "A judge may impose" instead of
"shall impose" the middle term. And that would be valid
to the extent that what they mean by "may" is they can
now impose the middle term based just on the facts found
by the jury.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Or they could say the middle term
will always be reasonable. Couldn't they say that?
MR. GOLD: They could, and in effect, they do say
that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Even though there is the
possibility that something above the middle term would
also be reasonable without necessarily finding a discrete
fact beyond the indictment to justify it. Right?
MR. GOLD: Yes. There are --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The protection that
criminal defendants now have, that they cannot be
sentenced to a higher term unless the judge makes
particular findings, will then be no longer applicable.
MR. GOLD: Yes, Your Honor. I -- and I --
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's true unless the
California legislature does what most states have done in
response to Booker, which is not that route at all. They
did maintain their determinate sentencing, but they just
required the jury finding. That's what I think seven out
of nine states have done.
MR. GOLD: Yes, Justice Stevens. And that was the
point I was going to make, that that is a very likely
outcome, given what the majority of other states have
done. And that, Mr. Chief Justice, would be a --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that now the defendant
will have the protection of his jury determining his
guilt, will not only have to know the evidence of his
guilt of the crime, but also know why he's likely to
re-offend in the future, things like he used a firearm,
all the bad things that will increase his sentence and
might affect how the jury views the issue of guilt in the
first place.
MR. GOLD: Not necessarily, Your Honor. Because
for those type of prejudicial factors, California is
well-positioned to handle those, because they do so
anyway in bifurcated proceedings. There are often
enhancement allegations that relate to recidivism or even
gang allegations, anything that's prejudicial are handled
at a separate proceeding after trial.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And are there a half a
dozen jury trials in each -- for each of those various
aggravating factors that now have to be tried to the
jury?
MR. GOLD: No, Your Honor, what I'm trying to say
is that basically California does that anyway now. Most
of the factors that relate to the defendant have to do
with recidivism. And those are the same kind of factors
that are alleged in the information, and are tried in a
bifurcated proceeding to the jury, or are waived and then
the trial court will consider them.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's interesting. Are there,
in fact -- what's your estimate, guess, as to how many
criminal jury-tried cases in California, what percent
have two juries? Have more than one jury?
MR. GOLD: They don't have more than one jury.
They are tried to the same jury, but they are tried after
the --
JUSTICE BREYER: In what percentage would you say
they have bifurcated or several jury trials? I mean,
more than just one.
MR. GOLD: Your Honor, I would say that there are
lots of cases where they're tried to a court. The
defendant will waive them if they're based on recidivism.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but how many, how many
times do they -- let me call it impaneling the jury
twice, or two juries, or it could be the same one.
MR. GOLD: The same --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. What percentage would you
guess? Just make a rough -- roughest conceivable guess.
MR. GOLD: Completely anecdotally, I would say 20
percent. I -- if -- I would like to reserve the
remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Gold.
Mr. Laurence.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY JEFFREY M. LAURENCE
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. LAURENCE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The central lesson from Booker, from the real
portion of Booker, is that not every constraint that's
placed on a trial court's discretion in selecting a term
within a range that requires fact-finding invokes the
Sixth Amendment requirement of a jury trial.
A reasonableness constraint that requires the
court to consider all the circumstances of the defendant
and select a reasonable sentence in relation to those
facts and those factors does not invoke the Sixth
Amendment jury trial right. California has consistently
construed its system as placing nothing more than a
reasonableness constraint on the trial court's discretion
in selecting among the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not so at all. California
says if you go over the middle range, it is unreasonable,
period, unless you prove or you find one of the
aggravating factors. That's a constraint. You cannot go
above the middle range.
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor, but that's the
same constraint that this Court found not above the
Constitution in Booker.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, that's not what we found in
Booker. We found in Booker, or at least the way the
lower Federal courts have been interpreting Booker, if
you use the guideline range, and you're within the
guideline range, that is automatically reasonable, you
don't have to worry about it.
But we haven't held, and I don't believe most of
the Federal courts have held, that if you go beyond the
guideline range, it is automatically unreasonable. And
that is the case with the California system, if you go
beyond the middle range, it is automatically unreasonable
unless you -- unless you find one of the aggravating
facts.
MR. LAURENCE: Your Honor, I'd have to
respectfully disagree with that because we're not talking
about a middle range. What we are talking about is an
end point. If I can use the Booker example, where you
have a term of 10 years to life, the court can certainly
make a selection within a reasonable range. At some
point, as the court increases its sentence beyond a
certain point, it will become unreasonable.
We don't need to identify specifically what that
point is, the guideline range or something close to it.
But when you get to the end point, if there's no
justification offered whatsoever for a life term --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the difference is, in the
Federal system, the judge can go above and it can be
reasonable based on facts that were found by the jury.
But in California, to go beyond the middle range
up to the upper range, it must be a fact not found by the
jury.
MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that not correct?
MR. LAURENCE: That's only correct because
California has a discrete three-term sentence.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Correct. But whatever the
reason, it is correct.
MR. LAURENCE: It is correct, Your Honor, but the
central point of both Booker and California is that that
upper term is being reversed not because it's
unauthorized, but because it's unreasonable.
JUSTICE STEVENS: On one hand, in one case, the
unreasonableness depends on a finding of fact not made by
the jury. But in the Federal system, it does not require
that finding by a jury.
MR. LAURENCE: Your Honor, if a Federal judge
wished to impose a life term, there would have to be
something to justify it, or it would be reversed on
appeal.
JUSTICE BREYER: It wouldn't necessarily be a
fact. It could be a fact. What it says in here is that
if the -- they speak of a circumstance related to the
crime, or the offender. And in a case in which no such
aggravating factor can be found, the judge cannot impose
the upper term.
Now, I grant you there's some language that I --
it seems to me on the next few paragraphs, seems to say
something a little different. But that language, if you
just take that, seems to say, unless, Judge, you find a
fact about the situation that would make it reasonable to
go above the middle range, you can't, under the law.
Now, if that's what it says, I have to admit, I
find it a little difficult to distinguish from Blakely
and other cases where I dissented, but the Court's law is
what the majority says. So that seems to me almost like
it, unless you can tell me that I'm wrong in that.
MR. LAURENCE: I would say you are wrong, Your
Honor, simply because California has construed its
sentencing law in 1170(b) as imposing nothing more than a
reasonableness --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but if -- as I understand it,
it has construed it by saying that if you go above the
middle term without a discrete finding of fact beyond
what has to be proven to the jury, it is unreasonable as
a matter of law. And that unreasonableness as a matter
of law feature is what distinguishes it from the Federal
system post Booker.
MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I would disagree,
because the upper term, the statutory maximum in Booker
would also be necessarily unreasonable if there was no
justification offered by the trial court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the justification under the
Federal system could be, you know, this is what the
sentencing commission thought was a reasonable sentence
for this crime. I disagree with that. Now, there are
other authorities who think that that's a little too, you
know, below what it ought to be. He can simply disagree
with the sentencing guidelines.
Or he could point out what Justice Breyer
suggests, well, the sentencing guidelines may be okay for
some jurisdictions, but in this jurisdiction, we have a
special problem with regard to this kind of a crime. He
can do that and doesn't have to find any special fact.
He cannot do that in California.
MR. LAURENCE: I have two responses to that, Your
Honor. First of all, with regard to what the ruling in
Booker was, the court's discretion has to be exercised in
relation to the policy considerations set out in 3553(a),
which are the same policy considerations that the court
must look at, very similar in California, that there are
-- the court doesn't have unbridled discretion, select
any term based on whim, based on whatever it feels would
be -- whatever he decides to do on Tuesday.
The court has to do it with regard to the policy
considerations that are inherent in what the guidelines
decisions were, and what the legislature established
should be appropriate sentencing considerations.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But that does not necessarily
mean that he must make a discrete finding of fact in
order to do it. We come back to Justice Scalia's hypo a
moment ago. He can go, you know, in theory, under
Booker, he can go above the guideline range consistent
with policy positions that may not be precise, without
necessarily making discrete findings of fact.
I mean, you'd have to judge it in each individual
case, but the possibility is there. And under the
California system, the possibility is not there.
MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, the systems
converge at the end point. And that is, under the
Federal system, going to that right end point would be
unreasonable in every circumstance if there's no
justification offered, other than he committed the
offense.
In California, because we have three discrete
terms rather than a spectrum, you have the same effect
when you get to the end point. It would be
unjustified -- it would be an unreasonable sentence if
there's no justification offered. But the fact that
California has three points rather than a range shouldn't
be constitutionally determinative.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And they can't be a fact -- in
California, it can't be a fact found by the jury, as
Justice Stevens pointed out. That's a significant
difference.
MR. LAURENCE: Well, it can't be an element. And
that -- obviously, there could be a circumstance where
some special findings were made, in which case that might
be beyond the elements. But it can't be an element
simply because you shouldn't be double counting what's
already established.
The range is set by the elements of the offense,
that all three terms are available from the jury verdict
based on those elements. If you are going to make a
selection within that range, it would have to be more
than simply the defendant committed the offense. And
that's the same with the Federal guidelines. Simply
saying --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't the same in the Federal
guidelines. Under the Federal guidelines, the judge
could say, you know, I think this offense is more serious
than what the sentencing commission thought, and these
are my reasons for it. There was a dissent, you know --
the sentencing commission's determinations are
reasonable, but they are surely not the only reasonable
disposition.
And it is open to a Federal district judge to say,
well, that's what they thought, and I took it into
account, and I seriously considered it, and I think they
are wrong on this, I think this is more serious. And
that could be a perfectly reasonable determination. That
couldn't be done in California.
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, it could, Your Honor. And I
would refer you to Rule 4.410 in our appendix, page 2 and
, that the general policy considerations that over --
that overlay our sentencing guidelines or our sentencing
system, include deterrence for this defendant and
deterring others from committing the same crime, that you
can just look to the -- what is happening in this
particular neighborhood, as the examples brought out.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying to us that under
the California system, if a California judge went through
exactly the thought process that Justice Scalia just
outlined and put that down on paper, without finding any
discrete fact beyond the elements the jury found, that he
could go to the third tier? I really think deterrence
requires the third tier, not the middle tier? Can a
California judge do that?
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor, deterrence is a
basis for going to the third tier.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's critical, and that's
what I didn't understand about --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's not true. You
certainly didn't argue that way in your papers up to now.
I thought that there has to be a finding of some
aggravating factor, not simply, I think deterrence is
more than what the statute says, or deterrence requires
more than what the statute says. Is that really your
position, that if a judge thinks deterrence requires more
than the middle range, for that reason alone, he can say
I ignore the middle range?
MR. LAURENCE: Well, that's part of the rules of
court under 4.410. Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where --
MR. LAURENCE: That would be --
JUSTICE BREYER: It's appendix page 3 in the
brief.
MR. LAURENCE: Page 2 and 3.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that that's the way
the Black court interpreted it. The Black court talked
about a requirement that the upper-term sentence be
imposed only if an aggravating factor exists.
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor, that would be
considered an aggravating factor, to use deterrence for
this particular case --
JUSTICE BREYER: What do I do here? Because the
sentence I read to you seems to say the opposite. But
then, two sentences on, they list, the Federal judge is
not bound by the guidelines, he must consult the
guidelines. And after they say, an aggravating
California -- it says the discretion available -- the --
in California law, that may include any fact that the
judge reasonably determines to be relevant. The
Determinate Sentencing Law, about an upper term, is
comparable to Booker's requirement that a Federal judge's
sentencing decision not be unreasonable.
Well, I assumed until this minute that the first
statement trumped the second. But now when I see the
court rule, certainly that court rule is possible, given
that to be read as permitting them, particularly with the
second statement, you could read the second statement as
saying, yes, they can say a particular instance or a kind
of sentence seemingly mandated at the middle level is, in
this community, so contrary to the purposes of punishment
that I'm giving a higher one. To be honest, I don't know
what Black means.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, before you --
could you tell me where the court rule you're talking
about is set out?
MR. LAURENCE: It's in our appendix, page -- the
appendix to our brief, I'm sorry, the appendix to our
brief, page 2 and 3.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You say in your brief, which
doesn't seem to me to comport with what you are saying
here, for a judge to exceed the base range, for example,
by applying enhancement or an alternative sentencing
scheme, the predicate fact for the enhancement or
alternative scheme must be pleaded and proved to a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt.
There's no indication there that the judge could
just say, I think more deterrence is necessary and
therefore, I'm going to exceed the base range. That's
just totally incompatible with that.
MR. LAURENCE: Your Honor, that's to exceed the
base range, to go beyond the three terms. If you want to
impose an enhancement for gun use, or for an enhancement
such as in Apprendi, not for selecting a term within the
base range.
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But even for
selecting a term within the base range, I'm going to read
now from Rule 4.20. Part (b) says, "circumstances in
aggravation and mitigation shall be established by a
preponderance of the evidence."
That's not the way we refer to judges' reasoning
about policy. That's the way we refer to proof of fact.
And I don't see how under subsection (b) your answer to
me can be correct.
MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I think the rules
of court are viewed as a whole with 4.408, which talks
about anything in addition to -- that the rules of -- the
examples set out are not exclusive and not determinant,
that anything can be a consideration.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but they have to be an
aggravating factor.
MR. LAURENCE: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And to talk about the need for
more deterrence as an aggravating factor, that's not an
aggravating factor.
MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I think that the
example that was given was in relation to the community
that was experiencing some uptick in crime.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not an aggravating factor.
It's a basis for imposing a harsher sentence, but it
doesn't aggravate this crime as opposed to the same crime
committed by other individuals. It's not an aggravating
factor.
MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, the importance of
our position, the central thrust of our position is that
the reasonableness constraint, the constraint imposed
under 1170(b) has been interpreted as a reasonableness
constraint. It doesn't matter if factors are required --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it can be a reasonableness
constraint and also be a reasonableness restraint that
requires a finding of discrete facts for reasonableness.
The two are not exclusive.
MR. LAURENCE: That's true, Your Honor. That's
true.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And the rule seems to conflate --
seems very clearly to conflate the finding of a discrete
fact. And it seems to me that we've got to consider the
rule in responding to the ambiguity that Justice Breyer
referred to a moment ago. The ambiguity has got to be
read in light of subsection (b), and subsection (b) seems
to answer the ambiguity by saying preponderance of the
evidence. That means a fact finding.
MR. LAURENCE: Well, let me explain it this way,
Your Honor, that it doesn't matter from our perspective
whether or not there is a factor required in order to say
that something is -- that the end point is reasonable, or
if you are taking deterrence into account, that that's
not -- it's not necessary for our argument because our
position is that even if a factor is required --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So do you think under subsection
(b) of Rule 4.420, if a judge said, I just think the
policy of deterrence requires something heavier, you
think that statement by the judge would satisfy the
requirement that circumstances in aggravation shall be
established by a preponderance of the evidence?
MR. LAURENCE: No, Your Honor. I don't.
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then it seems to me
that you cannot hold your position consistently with the
state rule of court.
MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I would refer
back to Black at 1255, which is the important part.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is Black repealing the rule of
court? I mean, Black -- if we refer back to Black, we
get the ambiguity that Justice Breyer has raised. In
order to solve the ambiguity, we look to the court rule.
MR. LAURENCE: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Under the court rule, you admit
that a judge's policy consideration, however sincerely
held, could not satisfy the requirement to prove
aggravation by a preponderance. Isn't that the end of
the issue? I mean, if California wants to amend its
rules or its statute, that's California's business. But
we can't do it.
MR. LAURENCE: Well, no, Your Honor, but
California has construed 1170(b) as not requiring a
--
fact-finding to move from the middle term to the upper
term. It's simply saying that when the court selects
between the three, the decision must be reasonable.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't you give a
different answer to my question? Why didn't you say, if
it is reasonable for the court to conclude that
deterrence really requires something tougher than the
middle term, that's enough? Why didn't you say that is
enough and (b) wouldn't preclude it?
MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I think that my
answer would have to be that in relation to the
hypothetical given, I was answering it because -- with
regards to the circumstances of the community that the
defendant committed the crime in. If we take that away
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Let's -- the judge, the
judge is on the bench. He says, there's too much crime
in our community, look at these statistics, I believe
that deterrence requires something heavier than the
middle tier. Nothing unusual about this particular
crime. I'm making a policy decision about what the law
should require in general. Would that satisfy part (b)
of 4.420?
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, I believe it would.
JUSTICE SOUTER: That would satisfy the
requirement of, as it puts it, establishing by a
preponderance of the evidence?
MR. LAURENCE: Uh-huh. Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: That was not what I understood
California law to be or your position to be until this
moment.
MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I have not been
suggesting that that single factor is what makes
California's law constitutional. What makes California's
law constitutional is the fact that the constraint
imposed on the court's discretion in selecting terms is a
reasonableness requirement, just like Booker.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Reasonably -- that does not
answer the problem.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think the California Supreme
Court and the California legislature would be astounded
to think that this is what they have wrought. They
obviously intended to establish a scheme in which the
judge would apply the middle range, not using his own
perception as to whether more punishment is justified or
not, unless there's some circumstances about this crime
that make this person more guilty, and that's what you
usually mean by aggravating circumstances, not the fact
that you believe the crime should bear -- in general,
should bear, a higher penalty. I think they would be
astounded to find that this is what they have created.
MR. LAURENCE: Your Honor, let me take a step back
then and say that, even with the requirement that there
be some factor, putting aside deterrence as a
possibility, California's system as structured, which
only requires a reasonableness constraint, does not
violate the Constitution. And the reason being because
all it's saying is that if you're going to the absolute
maximum, the farthest point on the spectrum available, if
there's no justification offered, it will be reversed as
unreasonable, not as unavailable.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the whole problem with
your case.
MR. LAURENCE: Certainly.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That there's -- and
incidentally, under the rules, under 4.410, those are
general objectives of sentencing.
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that is a term of art that's
different from circumstances.
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's only the circumstances
that have to be found by a preponderance of the evidence.
The general objectives can still be considered.
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what we are involved with in
this case and with this criminal, whose conviction and
sentence we're reviewing here, are circumstances that
aggravate, and these do require findings.
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If those findings aren't there,
it's not reasonable.
MR. LAURENCE: That is correct, Your Honor. Let's
just take it a step back and say that what we're talking
about is -- even if there are circumstances that are
required, even if there are some justifications that the
court must find aggravating factors, still the only
constraint is reasonableness.
And let me quote from what Black said about
70(b), how it's been construed, not from the facial
language, but how it's been construed. And what Black
says is on page 1255 that: "Although subdivision (b) is
worded in mandatory language, the requirement that an
aggravating factor exist is merely a requirement that the
decision to impose the upper term be reasonable."
JUSTICE BREYER: So what we have -- now, this has
clarified it, but I don't know what to do. I think if I
read the opinion the way you're saying, I would say the
California court, which is a good court, conscientious,
managing a huge system of criminal law in the state,
probably bigger than the Federal system, reads Blakely
and they see that those guidelines in California as
previously understood were violated.
And they're thinking, how do we maintain this
system as constitutional. And therefore, they write
61, which can be read as saying we're Bookerizing it,
and we come as close to Booker as necessary to make it
constitutional.
Now, that would be an understandable judicial
reaction, and I can read the opinion as saying that, at
which point I'm not certain what we're supposed to say,
because I have no doubt that your unease reflects the
fact that prior to Black, in California, it would have
been pretty unheard of for a judge to depart upward on
grounds other than factual grounds related to the
circumstances of the crime or offender. But I also have
no doubt that this opinion is written to try to save the
California system. All right, so now what do I do?
MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I think that the
one thing that seems to be giving you some difficulty is
the fact that California didn't explicitly say in Black,
we are now officially Bookerizing our system. And the
reason for that is because California had already
implicitly construed the system as making all three terms
legally available based on the jury verdict alone, and
had simply used a reasonableness requirement.
And that goes back to Hernandez, back in 1988,
when California essentially anticipated Apprendi, and
distinguished between making enhancements available based
on the jury verdict on the elements alone, versus the
three, the three components of the triad scheme.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it is the same old record
we've been playing. But the reasonableness requirement
has to be explained further. And when you explain it
further, you find that there must be findings by a
preponderance of the evidence for any of the aggravating
or mitigating circumstances that are set out. That's
different from the objectives of sentencing.
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the objectives of sentencing
are not what's involved in this case.
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor. And I -- whether
or not the objectives of sentencing are involved is not
the critical point of the constitutionality of this
system.
As far as California is concerned, what is
important is that, first of all, the fact that the
preponderance of the evidence requirement is essentially
the same as what's involved in making discretionary
findings within a range in the Federal system. And we're
talking about the findings within a range.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Would you want us to hold that,
you know, that we uphold the system here in an opinion
that says what California's sentencing judges may do
under California law, as you've described it to us, is
that they -- they may exceed the middle range whenever
they think that that is a better result, whenever they
think that that's reasonable?
MR. LAURENCE: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you think California would be
happy with that?
MR. LAURENCE: Yes. Reasonableness is the
touchstone of the constraint imposed upon the trial
courts in selecting among the three terms, and that would
be a perfectly --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, including reasonable
disagreement with the level of severity that the
legislature has provided in the middle term. I mean,
other legislatures may have provided higher severity and
the judge says, I simply disagree with the California
legislature. And it's a reasonable disagreement, because
some other legislature might have done what I do.
MR. LAURENCE: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That isn't reasonable? Why isn't
it reasonable?
--
MR. LAURENCE: Reasonableness has to be tied to
the policy considerations that underlie the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: He ties it to that. He says, I
just disagree with the California legislature as to
whether this is enough to prevent the defendant from
committing this kind of a crime. And look -- and he
cites another state which provides a much higher sentence
for the same crime. Can that possibly be unreasonable?
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor. I believe that
under the California --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Then you don't mean
reasonableness. You mean something else.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: May I ask you this question?
Excluding capital cases, in your view -- anecdotally, if
it has to be that -- what percentage of cases that go to
juries, that go to jury trial, result in bifurcated
proceedings for sentencing purposes? 10 percent?
MR. LAURENCE: I would say probably a rough guess
would be around 10 percent. That's -- we're dealing with
JUSTICE STEVENS: On that question, may I ask --
on that subject, may I ask you this question: Have you
read the brief filed by the National Association -- the
amicus brief by the National Association of Defense
Lawyers, which has a long discussion of the practical
consequences in other states and in California?
MR. LAURENCE: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And which I find, to be honest
to you, rather persuasive on the fact it's not such a big
deal as we thought it might be. And I'd like you to have
an opportunity to tell me whether there's something in
that brief that is not accurate.
MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, it would
certainly be a big deal to California. But more
importantly, if this Court were to say that a
reasonableness constraint reinvokes the Sixth Amendment,
you would be basically throwing into doubt the way Booker
has reformed the Federal system as well, because --
JUSTICE STEVENS: They say, if I remember it
correctly, that if the impact in a four day trial would
normally be an extra hour for the jury, that that's about
the burden on the system. And of course, 90 some percent
of your cases are pleaded out by guilty, so it's not the
major thing that we originally thought it might be. Do
you think, just across the board, are they fairly
accurate in their description of what happens in other
states as far as you're advised?
MR. LAURENCE: As far as the other states go, yes,
Your Honor. And I believe the impact on California would
be a requirement of a secondary trial after the main
trial. But it would also impose a burden of trying to
identify whatever aggravating circumstances or whatever
relevant considerations have to take place in this
particular case, which can be a multitude of things. In
California law, essentially anything can -- anything can
justify an upper term sentence. It's only when there's
absolutely nothing, not a scintilla of justification,
that an upper term becomes unreasonable and therefore
reversed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many cases would have
to be resentenced if we were to reverse in this case?
MR. LAURENCE: It's my understanding that under --
currently in California about 20 percent of the prison
population has an upper term. So I don't know how many
cases there are on a year-by-year basis, or since Blakely
or since Apprendi, but probably in the thousands,
possibly.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. You had 200,000
incarcerated when I last looked.
MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.
And the -- once again, the important aspect,
what's -- the key aspect is whether or not a term is
legally available, and whether or not there's a
constraint that's imposed that takes away that legal
availability as a threshold matter, rather than a
reasonableness review requirement.
California has consistently construed 1170(b) as
imposing a reasonableness requirement. This Court in
Booker said that a reasonableness requirement does not
limit the availability of those upper terms.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know of any case in which
a California trial judge has gone beyond the middle range
not on the basis of a fact that that judge has found, but
rather on the basis of some general policy he thinks that
the punishment should be greater, something along the
lines of what Justice Breyer suggested?
MR. LAURENCE: No, Your Honor, I'm not aware of
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not either, and I would be
astounded if any trial judge would read these statutes
and court rules that way.
MR. LAURENCE: Once again, Your Honor, that is not
the critical component of why this system is
constitutional. And that's not what we are advancing in
our briefs. It's not the position that I'm arguing here,
that that is what would save California's system.
What saves California's system is that the only
constraint imposed is a reasonableness constraint, and
that reasonableness constraint, 1170(b), has been
interpreted over time as simply imposing the abuse of
discretion standard on the court, and that has been
applied to all three terms. The middle term is also
reviewed for an abuse of discretion, as is the lower
term.
And what is important to note is, even though the
middle term -- the only reason the middle term has been
given the label "presumptive" is because the court
doesn't have to expressly articulate its reasons for
selecting it. But it still has to do a balancing to make
a determination as to what's reasonable, including the
middle term.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
Mr. Gold, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GOLD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want
to respond to three items. The first is, Mr. Chief
Justice, you were asking about what would be the effect
in California on those that have already been sentenced.
The only information I have was what was contained
in Black, that only 13 to 17 percent of cases are
sentenced in the upper range. But what the Court should
also consider is that most -- in most cases, the
difference between the middle term and upper term is
really only a year. In this case, it is four years,
which is somewhat unusual.
So in those cases, a lot of the people will have
already served their prison sentences by the time that
they would be able to benefit from any result in this
case.
I also wanted to echo what Justice Kennedy, I
believe, was saying. California Rules of Court, Rule
.410 is just general objectives of sentencing. These
are not aggravating factors. You can't take into account
achieving uniformity of sentencing, securing restitution
for the victims, these aren't aggravating factors that
the judge considers.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Rule 4.410(b) says
that the sentencing judge should be guided by the
criteria in these rules.
MR. GOLD: In sentencing, but I don't believe as
far as finding them as aggravating factors, these are not
facts that judges in California use to impose upper-term
sentences.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but a reading of the rule
indicates under (b), as the Chief Justice points out,
that the judge could take into account these policy
objectives.
MR. GOLD: Your Honor, all I can tell you is that
I've never seen a judge take these into account as an
aggravating factor. And I would be surprised, under the
case law, if these have been ever upheld as valid
aggravating factors.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think it is true that it
doesn't seem to be involved in this case. In this case,
we're under 4.420.
MR. GOLD: Certainly, yes. Certainly, not in this
case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have to conclude that
the California Supreme Court has misread California law
to agree with you, don't we?
MR. GOLD: No, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, I see 1170(b).
And I understand your argument, but when I read the
California Supreme Court opinion in Black, it says, well,
this is what it means. It doesn't seem to be what it
means, but they get to interpret it, don't they?
MR. GOLD: They do get to interpret how their
statutes operate, Your Honor, but I believe that they are
consistent in saying that this is a mandatory system.
In every one of their quotes, they talk about either a
judge must impose the middle term unless there are
aggravating factors, or they talk about the
requirement -- I was going to mention Justice Breyer's
quote from Black.
--
And even in that one, they say because an
aggravating factor under California law may include any
factor that the judge reasonably deems to be relevant,
and then say the Determinate Sentencing Law's requirement
that an upper-term sentence be imposed only if an
aggravating factor exists. They always talk about the
requirement that this aggravating factor must exist.
JUSTICE BREYER: So it is comparable to Booker.
And then in the preceding four paragraphs, they correctly
describe Booker?
MR. GOLD: Yes. And we have no doubt that they
are trying to fit the Determinate Sentence Law within
Booker, but Booker is about making -- the magic word, as
it were, is advisory versus mandatory, not
reasonableness.
So yes, the California system is reasonable. And
that's what the California Supreme Court is talking about
JUSTICE ALITO: Under any guideline system,
whether it's mandatory or advisory, once -- if you have a
mandatory system or an advisory system with appellate
review, once the appellate review function has been
performed, will it not be the case that trial judges will
not have unfettered discretion, will have very limited
discretion in choosing, making these sentencing policy
determinations?
That's the whole purpose of a guidelines system.
That the individual trial judges don't get to decide, you
know, how much deterrence they think is necessary, or how
severe they think an individual crime is, that there's
supposed to be some kind of uniformity.
MR. GOLD: Well, Justice Alito, there is
discretion in our system. But it is the discretion to
impose an upper-term after finding aggravating factors.
And I think that in an indeterminate system, as you were
discussing earlier, I think that that -- I'm not sure.
It depends what the system is, as far as what the
reasonableness constraints are.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Gold. The
case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the
