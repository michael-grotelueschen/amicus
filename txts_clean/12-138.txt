CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

of Argentina.
Mr. Goldstein.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
We ask you to resolve this case narrowly by
reaffirming that an arbitrator, rather than a court,
presumptively resolves a dispute over a precondition to
arbitration.  That holding would decide the question
presented and would resolve the circuit conflict and
govern 99 percent of the cases in the lower courts.
Argentina wants you to decide a different
issue.  Its position in this Court is that there is no
arbitration agreement with my client in the first place,
so it says a precondition to that non-existent agreement
is irrelevant.  Now --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Goldstein, do you
take the position that parties can't, by contract, say,
this particular precondition is -- goes to my -- to the
parties' consent to arbitrate?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We do not take that
position.  If a party were to say that, as the
governments in NAFTA have done, as the Solicitor
point -- Solicitor General points out is the language of
the U.S./South Korea Bilateral Investment Treaty, unlike
this one, we think it would be settled that a Court
would resolve the dispute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So if the
issue is what did the parties -- as I see it -- what did
the parties intend on this question, why isn't the first
options Howsam divide the one that we should follow in
this setting?  The Solicitor General is suggesting that
we shouldn't follow that.  We should give some sort of
heightened deference to the foreign state, but I'm not
sure why because the issue is always about what did the
parties intend.
And, if the issue is always about that,
don't we look at the text, the custom and practice of
the industry, the behavior between the parties?  Don't
we look at all of the factors we normally look at in
deciding whether something goes to a substantive or
procedural issue?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  So let me see if I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So it's not
that we hold, absolutely, that in every situation a
precondition is subject to an arbitral decision.  We
look to those -- to the issue of consent, don't we?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, a couple of things
about that.  You do -- you have held in Howsam that, if
there is a precondition to arbitration, it is
presumptively decided by the arbitrators, rather than
the courts, so that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Maybe that's why the
government is saying, we shouldn't treat it as a
presumption, we should just treat it as --
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  All right.  Maybe I can help
by locating the parties' different arguments in this
case because there are a lot of them.  We have said, of
course, that we think you should decide the question
presented.  Argentina wants you to go beyond the
question presented.  We can talk about whether that's
appropriate.
If you did decide the question of consent, I
think you would do it in a three-part opinion, and some
of the parts are contested, and some aren't.  This is
how I would write the opinion:  Part one would say look
at our decision in Howsam, and it's undisputed here that
if this was an ordinary contract case, just between two
American companies, then BG Group would win because this
looks just like a procedural precondition.
It's like the John Wiley staged grievance
procedure, and I don't think the other side argues
against that.
Then the other side has given you two
different arguments for why you wouldn't apply Howsam
and why you might have a different analytical framework.
The first argument, we could call it part two of the
opinion, is the argument of the United States.  And what
the United States says is, look, the difference between
this and Howsam is it's an international case.
And what's different in international cases
is that, when you dealt with Howsam, you dealt with a
set of expectations between parties agreeing to
arbitrate that may not apply in the international
context, and so maybe it's different.
Now, this -- and the reason they say that
it's different is that an international case, when it's
cited in the United States, is governed by the New York
Convention.  And in a New York Convention case, whether
it's a commercial case, whether it's an international
treaty arbitration case, what the rule of judicial
review is -- and that's what we're looking at here, do
the arbitrators finally decide the question, or does a
court, on judicial review, decide it?
In a New York Convention case, you look to
the law of the citeus, here, the United States, the
Federal Arbitration Act.  So I take the Solicitor
General's position to be this:  Look, when you have
Argentina arbitrating against a company from the United
Kingdom, then the Argentine company and -- excuse me --
Argentina and the UK Company don't have any ex-ante
understanding about whether the dispute will be finally
resolved by a court or, instead, the arbitrators because
who knows where the arbitration would occur.  Here, it
occurred in the United States.
Our answer is that this objection answers
itself.  It's true that they don't have a specific
judicial system, that it will be ahead of time when they
sign the treaty -- Argentina signs a treaty with the
United Kingdom.  They don't know whether a dispute over
this precondition will be resolved de novo or, instead,
it will be resolved deferentially because they don't
know where the arbitration will occur, but they do know
that the applicable law will be the citeus of the
arbitration.  And there is precedent on this.
The government's argument here is about
international arbitration governed by the New York
Convention.  There are 149 signatories to the New York
Convention.  There have been thousands of challenges to
arbitral awards under the New York Convention.  And we
are unaware of any precedent from any country, ever,
that says we are going to not apply our domestic system
set of rules, here, the Howsam first options lines,
because this is an international case.
We know that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm not sure that this
argument helps you, but it's your argument.  But this
arbitration took place in the United States because the
parties agreed that's where it would take place, right?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So your -- your argument is
that, by agreeing that the arbitration would take place
in the United States, they bought into U.S. arbitration
law, no international modification?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's correct.  And that is
what has been true in every New York Convention case
ever decided in the United States and, so far as we are
aware, every case decided by every New York Convention
signatory because they have -- they are accepting a body
of rules.  When you were trying to confirm or overturn
the award, they agreed to put it here.  That's how it --
JUSTICE ALITO:  See, I would have thought
that there would -- there'd be an argument for saying
that the first options principle shouldn't apply to
international -- or to a bilateral investment treaty.
The whole point of these treaties, as I
understand it, is to take these disputes out of the
courts because of distrust, at least of the courts of
the country against which the claim is asserted and --
and put it in an international tribunal where some sort
of standard international principles would apply, but
that's -- you don't like the idea.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, that's part three of the
opinion.  I just haven't gotten there.  Here's the
reason why, and that is, the government's argument about
the New York Convention doesn't have anything to do with
investment treaties.  It's about the New York
Convention.
And so it applies -- a company from Japan
sues a company from Ecuador, and they arbitrate in the
United States.  So the government's position has very
wide-ranging consequences for any international
arbitration in the United States.
Now, Argentina does make the argument that
you've described, and this is the next part of the
opinion, if we got past the government's position, which
I don't think has any precedent for having a special
international rule, we come to Argentina's argument.
And Argentina says this:  Look, the reason this isn't
Howsam is that this is a unilateral contract,
effectively, and that is, we put our treaty out there,
and now, BG Group has to do something in order to create
an arbitration agreement in the first place because we
don't have an arbitration agreement with them, we havenâ€™t
consented to arbitration, then, because of that, call it a
precondition, call it whatever you want, because an
arbitration agreement hasn't formed, the arbitrators
have no power to decide anything, and, therefore, you
can't defer to their judgment.
We would never expect them to have the power
to decide anything Argentina says because there's no
arbitration agreement at all.  So that's the next part
of the opinion, and it will get to the points you
raised, Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you just a -- a
practical question and maybe the answer to this is
obvious.  Is it too late, now, for you to begin
litigation in Argentina?  Wait 18 months and then pursue
arbitration?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is not.  There is a
principle of latches, but there is an equivalent
principle of equitable tolling, so it's true that we
could go there.  I do think, ultimately, it's a point in
our favor because it shows how pointless this exercise
is.
We'll recall, of course, that while we could
leave -- we could file a claim in the Argentine courts,
the Argentine courts, of course, would have the power to
do nothing at all.  They couldn't bind us.  They
couldn't bind Argentina.  They wouldn't have to decide
the case in the first place, and then we would be back
here.
And the question is, if you have a provision
like that, which is, effectively, go wait in the
Argentine courts, does anybody seriously think that that
determines your consent to arbitrate, when it is that
that act, going and sitting, can't have any effect on
the case whatsoever.  Do we really --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's not
true.  There are numerous statutory regimes where
Congress has decided, for example, it's valuable to give
people a period of time to negotiate or discuss before
you can go into -- into court.  I mean, the EEOC and
other sorts of things saying, let's everybody -- you
know, step back, you have to negotiate for six months or
you can't sue for another eight months.
And a lot of times, nobody think that's
going to change anything, but you can understand
Argentina or any other country saying, look, before
we're going to arbitrate -- you know, try our courts,
you may find -- you may be surprised, right?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We would be.
(Laughter.)
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  But, Mr. Chief Justice, my
point isn't that it's not important.  I'll give them
that it's important; they negotiated for it.  My point
is that whether it's important or not doesn't tell you
if it's a procedural step or a substantive step, in
terms of their agreeing to arbitrate with us.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, then, let me just
make clear where we are.  Suppose we -- or at least I,
were to conclude that the court of appeals was right,
that it is for the Judicial Branch to decide whether
there is an arbitration agreement and duty to arbitrate.
Then I were to further conclude that, given Argentina's
position, they have waived the judicial requirement and
that this arbitration should proceed.  I can't reach
that second question because it wasn't raised.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kennedy, the way you
would resolve that issue, I believe, is to get to
Argentina's argument that it did not consent to
arbitration, that there is no -- there is no
arbitration agreement in the first place, you would have
to go outside the question presented to begin with.
Remember, the question presented that you
granted certiorari on, to resolve a very distinct
circuit conflict at the urging of the arbitration
community was what do we do if we have an arbitration
agreement and this is a precondition to arbitration?
If you were going to decide the antecedent
question, the question before that, is there an
arbitration agreement at all, which is my part three, it
is the argument that Argentina is raising in this Court,
then I think you have to carry it all the way through.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let me just put
it -- I think there is -- this is a close case.  I think
there is substantial merit, the United Kingdom court is
correct and that the court of appeals here is correct,
as to the authority of the Court to decide the issue.  I
also think that they are probably wrong on the merits,
but I cannot reach that second question.  It wasn't
presented.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, I agree with you,
Justice Kennedy, that if you were asking me did the D.C.
Circuit correctly interpret the treaty and decide -- I
misunderstood you.  You have asked me, look, I see the
D.C. Circuit's decision, which is three sentences long,
on the question of whether they can invoke this waiting
period, and I see the arbitrators, they're the experts.
It's much more substantial.
If you accept the United States' argument to
remand this case, which neither of the parties think you
should, then it could be -- you could suggest to the
D.C. Circuit it reopen it.
But, otherwise, I'm going to agree with you,
Justice Kennedy.  I am a believer that you should stick
with the question presented and the arguments that are
properly presented to you.
Let me try, then, to deal with your point
about the United Kingdom court and the point about how
courts decide if there is an arbitration agreement.  We
actually agree that you -- you are obviously a court --
you need to decide if there is an arbitration agreement
here.  You do decide that de novo.
The point that I want to get to in the part
three of an opinion that I am imagining is that there
clearly is an arbitration agreement here, and I am going
to come to that in one second.  I will just bracket the
point about the United Kingdom.  Remember that, as I
said with the New York Convention, the United Kingdom
has one system for reviewing arbitral awards,
Switzerland has another, we have another one.
What you need to look to, I think, is your
own body of law because each one of those systems is
because of not some great principle --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Goldstein, you have
given us three parts for an opinion.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it your position,
essentially, that, under this bilateral agreement, the
case is to be decided by an arbitrator, not by a court
in Argentina or the United States?  And so the question
is when an arbitrator will decide the case.  And so the
question of when doesn't say whether it's an agreement
or not.  It just says, that you sued too early, you
started it -- you started too early.
Is that your essential position, that this
bilateral agreement says arbitration is the way this
dispute gets decided, and everything on the way to that
is what you call a preliminary question, but,
essentially, the parties have agreed that their disputes
will be solved by arbitration?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  And can I maybe take
you to the treaty itself and explain what I think are
the questions for courts and what I think are the
questions for the arbitrators?  Because I actually think
it's pretty clear from the treaty.  It's in our Blue
Brief in the appendix.
But Justice Ginsburg, the answer to your
question is yes, and I will explain how that plays out
under the treaty.  So this is the agreement that
Argentina made with the United Kingdom, and the dispute
resolution provision starts at Page 8A, it's Article 8.
Now, there are three conditions in this
agreement on Argentina's consent to arbitrate.  It does
have to agree, and we had to do something.  We had to
invest.  And those three conditions are set out in the
first sentence of the dispute resolution provision.
It says -- and I am now on Article 8, Roman
I.  "Disputes with regard to an investment," so this
arbitration provision is only going to apply to an
investment, which is a defined term under the treaty,
"which arises within the terms of the agreement."  So it
has to be a treaty claim.  "Between an investor of one
contracting party and the other contracting party."
And so that is it has to be a U.K. investor
suing an -- seeking to arbitrate against an Argentine
company.  And those are -- if those things aren't true,
there is no arbitration agreement.
Now, that -- that language that I just read
to you is from the local litigation provision, and then
the treaty says the exact same body of disputes are
eligible substantively for arbitration.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's -- it
seems to me that this is a difficulty for you, the
structure of the treaty.  I mean, if you just end it
after one, nobody would say, oh, well they must be
contemplating arbitration or arbitration is in the
background.  They say, look, you have got a
dispute, if you don't resolve it, you bring it in court.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Nothing about
arbitration even in the background.  Then they say, if
you want to go to arbitration, you can.  So, when you
look at just the structure, it seems to suggest that
Article I -- 8(I) is not part of the arbitration
provision.  It stands there and says, this is what you
do, and then the arbitration kicks in later.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I'll agree with that, but I
just don't think you can ignore the rest of it.  And so
let me explain why that's true.  So as I said, those
three conditions apply to the arbitration provisions, So
I'm at the top of 9A.
"The aforementioned disputes" -- those are
the ones that meet the three conditions -- "shall be
submitted to international arbitration."  And then,
Mr. Chief Justice, it turns immediately to the
relationship between the local litigation and the
arbitration.  And it's common ground that, in the
example that you gave, if you had just part one -- and I
just think it's really important by you,
Mr. Chief Justice, and that is, if this provision said,
go litigate in the local courts, come what may, this
would be a completely different case.
But this provision is wildly different from
that.  It says, go to the local courts; whatever they
do, it makes no difference.  It cannot stop the case, it
can't change the issues that will be arbitrated, it
can't have any effect on the arbitrator's decisions.  It
is exactly like a waiting period, which exists in every
international --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that -- your
argument would be better there if this was Article 8 --
you know, arbitration of disputes or -- you know,
parties can arbitrate, but, first, they must do this.
No, it just -- you know, says settlement of disputes.
The first thing is you can go to court here.  The second
thing is, if you want to arbitrate, you do this.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Mr. Chief Justice,
but then I would just take you to the next page, sub 4,
and we understand what the answer to that ambiguity
perhaps is, the last sentence is, "The arbitration decision
shall be final and binding on both parties."  That is
the only body under this treaty that can issue a
decision that decides the parties' dispute.  It's only
the arbitrators.  Now --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you want to
accept the invitation to arbitrate that is in 8(II).  If
you don't, if you go to 8(I), which doesn't say
anything, then, presumably, the decision of the tribunal
will be binding.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Fair enough -- no, that's
not quite right, Mr. Chief Justice, because, remember,
imagine that we went to the Argentine courts, and for
the first time ever, we won.  And so that an Argentine
court told the Argentine state, you know, we actually
think you should pay this company $200 million.
What would happen then is that Argentina can
take the question to arbitration, but nothing about the
local court's decision binds anyone.  We -- there is
never a point at which you can say that the investor
will abide by or be bound by a decision of an Argentine
court under this system.  That's what's so unusual about
it.
Perhaps I can explain why it's there --
because it is odd, I will tell you, and I will tell you
that, in deciding this question that Argentina is adding
to the case, in the context of this local litigation
provision, it is a very strange vehicle to do that.
There are only -- only 1 percent of bilateral investment
treaties have this provision.  It's a historic remnant.
It's in -- of the first 15 bilateral
investment treaties that Argentina agreed to, it's in
nine of them.  In the subsequent 40 of them, it doesn't
appear at all, again, a good example of how it isn't
really a condition on their consent.
And it is a remnant of an era of espousal.
It used to be the case that, before these treaties, that
an investor in BG's position would have to go to the
Argentine courts.  And when Argentina first created the
investment treaties, it kind of liked the idea that you
had to spend some time in the courts.
But no one would agree to the treaty -- this
is Justice Alito's question earlier -- no one would ever
agree to these treaties if they didn't know that the
decisionmaker would be the neutral, expert arbitrators,
and so it just has this you-have-to-wait-in-court feel
to it.  But it is absolutely critical that we look at
the substance of the provision.
It's very much, Mr. Chief Justice, like the
John Wiley case, which is structured, one, you will have
step one of our grievance process; step two, within five
days you have to go to our next step of the grievance
process; step three, then you can go on to arbitration.
It could have stopped, theoretically, at any of those.
If you had given up at step one or two, you would well
have been bound by it.
But the question you are being asked here,
if we could just return to if you are trying to decide
this de novo or, instead, defer to the arbitrator's
interpretation of whether this litigation provision is
binding, is, fundamentally, when Argentina went into
this treaty, did it think that the arbitrators were
going to resolve the disputes?  Right?
Did it expect -- it's a question of consent,
Justice Sotomayor -- did it expect that the answers to
these questions would come from the arbitrators or,
instead, the courts?
And when we are talking about the process
for getting it going -- Justice Ginsburg talked about
the timing, do you have to do this for 18 months, there
is another provision here about 3 months, the natural
understanding is that there is an arbitration agreement,
Argentina knew that it could only get this treaty if
there was a guarantee to the investors that they would
be able to arbitrate, and so expects the arbitrators to
decide this.
Imagine Argentina's world, if you will.
Argentina's world is that every timing question, whether
something has to be filed on blue paper -- I have no
idea what the line they want to draw is.  Every
procedural step is, instead, a condition on its consent
to arbitrate, and that doesn't seem to make any sense at
all.  There have to be procedural prerequisites.
And Argentina would recharacterize this as,
as I said, a unilateral agreement.  So it's like
Argentina says -- posts a sign on a pole and says, if
you pay me -- if you find my dog, I will give you $100.
And so you have to perform an act.  And it says we have
to perform an act here.  We have to go to the local
courts, or otherwise, there is no agreement at all.
Well, a few things about that.  Arbitration
is not a dog, and Article 8, if we just go back to page
8A, does not require us to submit it to the local courts
at all.  This can't be a step that we are required to
take because we are not required to take it.
If I could just take you to the last two
lines of it?  "It shall be submitted at the request of
one of the parties to the dispute."  Argentina was just
as entitled as us to put this into the local courts as
we were.  It can't have been an expectation that we had
to do something before it would consent to arbitration.
And so I do think that this is just on all fours with
John Wiley for that -- for that reason.
The only other thing that has been put on
the table in front of you is the question of whether
Argentina's sovereignty should make a difference here.
And this is kind of the second theme of the brief of the
United States.
And I would say about that that the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act, which was discussed, of
course, in the last argument, has an express waiver of
sovereign immunity for arbitration awards that's
controlled here.
And if -- when the Solicitor General's
representative speaks, talked -- if that person were to
talk about what the treatment of these issues in other
countries is, we are unaware, again, of any country in
the world where the arbitral system of review in the
courts changes in the slightest because one party
happens to be a signatory to a treaty, and that makes a
ton of sense.
Again, this is fundamentally a commercial
relationship.  Argentina knew that it couldn't, in
its -- in the crisis that gave rise to these investment
treaties, Argentina couldn't get the money to come into
the country if it hadn't agreed to arbitration.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, what do you do
with Wintershall?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So, Your Honor, I think that
there are a variety of cases out there that deal with
the question in other jurisdictions of different ways of
reviewing arbitration awards.  And those are unique to
their own arbitral system.  We've cited decisions
from -- a decision from France, for example, that
follows your Howsam line.
The important point I would make is that
there is -- when the other side points to decisions in
which a court reviews de novo a jurisdictional ruling of
an arbitral tribunal, none of those decisions are unique
in any way to the fact that it was an international
arbitration or an international treaty arbitration.
Their international rule, the U.K. rule, the
rule in lots of other countries, is simply about
arbitration.  The reason that the other side can say
that this case might well be reviewed de novo in the
United Kingdom, for example, is that the jurisdictional
decision in essentially every arbitration of any kind in
the United Kingdom will be reviewed de novo.
They just have a different approach to these
questions.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't that the same thing
in France, which is supposed to be a popular place for
international arbitration, that, in the first instance,
the arbitrator decides, but, ultimately, the court can
review everything?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is not the most current
view, Justice Ginsburg.  In a case called Nihon Plast,
which was the most recent court of appeals decision in
France in 2004, the court adopted the
procedural-substantive distinction that very much
parallels Justice Breyer's opinion in the Howsam case.
But, even if it were the case, it's because
the French have their own approach to arbitration.  We
have a system that says, look, if you can always run off
to court because of any of these procedural
objections -- it has to be on blue paper, you didn't
write -- wait for the -- wait 30 days, another great
example would be, in lots of arbitration provisions, you
have to submit a sufficiently detailed statement of
claim to the arbitrators.
Well, that would be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do I understand your
position that, in this case, you did not have to go to
the Federal -- to the Argentine court, by reason of the
language in this agreement and not by reason of anything
that Argentina did?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The language in the
agreement meant that what Argentina did disentitled it
from being able to rely on this provision.  I will take
you, quickly, if you don't mind, to the provisions of
the treaty so you know what I am talking about.  There
are two of them.
One is the one that the arbitrators relied
on, and that is in the arbitration provision 8-4, which
is on 10A, it says, "The arbitral tribunal shall decide
the dispute in accordance with the provisions of this
agreement, the laws of the contracting party involved in
the dispute, including conflict of laws," and, then, at
the end of the sentence, "the applicable principles of
international law."
So this exhaustion requirement -- it's not
even an exhaustion requirement -- the local litigation
requirement is subject to international law.  And then
earlier -- and so three other tribunals have reached the
same conclusion as this one, that you -- for that reason
of that provision, you can't rely in the particular
circumstances on the local litigation.  And then Article
3 --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Say that again.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  By reason of --
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  There are three other
tribunals --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  -- that have reached the
same conclusion as this one, and that is Argentina can't
rely on the local litigation provision because it
effectively closed the courthouse doors.  It's own
conduct disentitled it.
Then ten other tribunals have reached the
same conclusion based on Article 3, the most favored
nation provision, because this requirement doesn't exist
in the Argentina/U.S. BIT.  There are only three
tribunals -- to be clear, only three tribunals out of 16
or 17 have agreed to enforce it.
If I could reserve the remainder of my time?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Anders.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING VACATUR AND REMAND
MS. ANDERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The government's position in this case is
based on the fact that this case involves a bilateral
investment treaty in which the states' parties set forth
a standing offer to arbitrate in the treaty itself.
Because it's the treaty that determines whether there is
an arbitration agreement in this case, principles of
treaty interpretation have to be used to assess whether
there is an agreement.
So, therefore, applying the domestic law
presumptions that are set forth in Howsam to this type
of investor-state arbitration we think would not be
appropriate.  Howsam shouldn't apply by its terms
because the question here is a question of treaty
interpretation, not a question of the likely
expectations of parties to a domestic commercial
contract.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I must say I don't follow
that -- that line of argument.  I mean, it seems to me
the treaty sets the framework for an agreement, but it
is ultimately the agreement that governs.
MS. ANDERS:  Well, there is no agreement
unless the investor submits the claim to arbitration in
accordance with the terms of the treaty, the conditions
on the state's consent.  So, for instance, in the United
States investment treaties and free trade agreements
such as NAFTA the United States says that an investor
may submit a claim to arbitration only if it first
satisfies certainly procedural conditions.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't -- I can't find --
it seems to me this has sprung, full blown, from
someone's brain, but is not well embedded in any law
that I could yet find.  That is the -- this is not meant
to be rude.  I'm trying to figure out where this idea of
the consent thing comes from.
After all, it apparently comes from our
Korean treaty and maybe one other, but I can't find it
in -- I can't find -- the question in the case is, is
this particular agreement, namely an agreement to go to
the court first -- shall we count it as that kind of
matter as to whether this is arbitrable that goes to a
judge?  Or rather is it that kind of procedural
Howsam/Wiley type thing that goes to an arbitrator?
Now, we did our best, I think, to try to
explain how to distinguish the one from the other in our
precedent.  Now, you use different words.  You use these
words about "consent," which doesn't appear anywhere in
this treaty, but I think you are trying to get at the
same thing.
And if you are not trying to get at the same
thing, why?  Why not?  What are you trying to get at?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think the reason that
applying Howsam and its presumption that certain
procedural-type requirements, like notice requirements,
would be decided by the arbitrator, the reason that
would risk subjecting a state to suit without its
consent is that, in investment treaties, what the states
do is they say we will be subject to arbitration under
certain circumstances.
But they also place limitations on their
consent to that adjudication, in order to satisfy
important sovereign --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you suggesting that
they --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So if in fact there was the
sate that said, Look, they don't say anything in the
treaty, but it turns out, for purposes of counting time
limits, filing a brief, they count Saturdays, but they
don't count Sundays.  All right?  And the government
says, quite sincerely, if we had known that they were
going to do that, we never would have agreed.
I am trying to get an example of something
that is as purely procedural as I can imagine, something
no one in his right mind would think a judge, rather
than an arbitrator, should decide.  But, under your
rule, you're going to say the judges decide that and not
the arbitrators, and that is what is bothering me about
your rule.
MS. ANDERS:  Well, they decided them because
the state sets forth in the treaty itself that these are
limitations on their consent.
JUSTICE BREYER:  By the way, in the treaty
itself, you can have dozens of things, as was true of
Howsam, we will follow the UNCTAD, whatever that is, the
UN -- or AAA rules, and you look up AAA Rule No.
1872(b), and it says just what I said.  Okay?  So, now,
it's in the treaty itself, and why should that matter?
MS. ANDERS:  Because, for instance, what the
United States has done in negotiating its treaties and
free trade agreements for decades, in every one of these
agreements, is it has said, we need to limit the
circumstances in which we are subject to suit --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I have only found two, by
the way.  One was Korea, and I can't remember the
second.
MS. ANDERS:  Well, we cited in our brief the
Korea and --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But in any case --
MS. ANDERS:  -- and NAFTA.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- you explicitly say,
these are our conditions of consent, and you raise the
question to me, you don't answer it, because suppose one
of those conditions had to do with blue paper, rather
than white paper, suppose that they were just what I
said, nobody still would think the United States was
resisting arbitration on such a matter.
MS. ANDERS:  Well, to give you an example of
a condition that we've actually used, NAFTA requires, as
a condition on the United States' consent to arbitrate,
that the investors, when they submit the claim to
arbitration, they waive their right to pursue other
remedies, and that satisfies a very important sovereign
interests that we have and not being subject to parallel
proceedings --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So, here, you are putting
yourselves, I gather, that the UN rules, the AAA rules,
the scholars who file our briefs, the Doctrine of
Competence-Competence, whatever that might be, is, in
fact, far broader than what they want.  It submits
virtually every question of arbitrability to the
arbitrator.  And the United States is taking a position
quite contrary, I guess, to most of the world.
MS. ANDERS:  I don't think that's correct,
Justice Breyer.  What we are -- what we are saying is
that, when a condition goes to consent, whether it is
fulfilled or not goes to whether --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do we know that?  How
do we know that?  The question is, is this litigation
preliminary -- going to the Argentinian court, is the
litigation preliminary a condition on the consent to
arbitrate a dispute?  What is the answer to that
question, in the view of the United States?
MS. ANDERS:  That's a question of treaty
interpretation, and this Court has said that you look to
first the text, but you also --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Alright, so you've
done all that.  And what does the United States -- the
United States is saying, court, you should look to all
these sources, and then answer the question, is the
litigation preliminary a condition on consent to
arbitrate the dispute?  So, after looking at the sources
that the United States is telling the court it should
look to, what is the answer of the United States to that
question?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, the United States doesn't
feel that it is appropriate for it to express a
definitive view on that question now because the parties
have not argued this, really, as a question --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I would feel better about
that argument, Ms. Anders, if you had at least suggested
how we should go about deciding that question.
MS. ANDERS:  And I could do that. Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because you read this
through your brief, and I don't know what a
consent-based objection is.  In fact, you say
consent-based objections can look very, very procedural,
and it's still consent-based, or it might not be
consent-based.
So all the -- the techniques that we use in
the Howsam-First Options line of cases seem to go out
the window and not be replaced with anything else.
MS. ANDERS:  I don't think that's -- that's
right.  I think what you look to, just looking at the
text, you can look to whether the text expressly calls
something a condition on consent.  So, for instance, in
NAFTA, NAFTA says that there are certain conditions --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's no different
from the rules we apply when there isn't a treaty, of
course.  I mean, if the arbitration agreement said that,
that the -- you know, the agreement is conditioned on,
of course.  So what else?  What different rules would
you apply, other than the common-sense rules that we use
for arbitration agreements?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, you would also -- you
would also look, possibly, for mandatory language in the
treaty; so, for instance, if the treaty says that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We would look to mandatory
language in the arbitration agreement.
MS. ANDERS:  I think that's right, but the
problem with applying Howsam is that it's a presumption
that is purely based on the nature of the requirement,
so the fact that it is a notice requirement, the fact
that it is a time limit, that that means that it's
procedural and, therefore, the arbitrators would decide,
unless it is clearly stated --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What about this -- what
about this principle:  If something, if some requirement
seems to serve virtually no purpose, it's unlikely to be
a condition of consent.  Would you accept that?
MS. ANDERS:  No, I think that is still --
that would be grafting on a default term onto the treaty
that may not reflect the treaty parties' intent.  I
think, when states negotiate for these conditions on
consent, what they are looking to are --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there is nothing in
the treaty that talks about consent at all, so we have
to decide whether some requirement is a consent, is on
something which consent is conditioned, or it's just a
procedural requirement that would be decided by an
arbitrator.
Would you not -- would you disagree with the
proposition that, if something really is trivial, it
doesn't seem to accomplish much of anything, it's a
historical vestige, it's unlikely to be a condition of
consent.
MS. ANDERS:  I think that one of the things
the Court could look to is the nature of the
requirements, does it serve sovereign functions?  But I
think, in doing that analysis, it's important to look to
what the state says are the functions that its
requirements are serving.
So for instance, our notice requirement in
our treaties, they serve the purpose of giving us
advance notice of particular claims and time to correct
problems that may have been caused -- you know, that we
can correct and, therefore, avoid arbitration to begin
with.
So I think you would look to the nature of
the requirement, the text of the treaty, whether it's
mandatory or whether it's expressly conditional.  You
can also look, obviously, to what this Court has called
ease of interpretation, so that would be the
postratification understanding.
If this were our treaty, we would bring
in -- you know, the letter of transmittal that the State
Department had provided after it had negotiated the
treaty -- you know, there would be a lot of information
like that that a Court could look to.
And I think as the Court noted, in the
Sumitomo case, you can have similar language in similar
treaties that have different meaning because there is
different negotiating history or the aids to
interpretation point different ways.
So our point here is that it's a matter of
treaty interpretation and that you simply have to look
to the text of the treaty --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What's wrong with the
House -- and I'm being a little defensive here -- but I
didn't think there was the presumption you are talking
about.  I thought it said there's a presumption about
that procedural rule, and I thought important language
was the language that the Court has found the phrase,
i.e., for the judge, applicable in the narrow
circumstance where contracting parties would likely have
expected a Court to have decided the gateway matter.
Now, that, it seems to me, a little bit
easier to work with than this notion of whether a state
gave consent or didn't give consent or it doesn't
mention it in the treaty.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Briefly.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Thank you.
MS. ANDERS:  I think, in the treaty context,
the states' parties are not agreeing, and they don't
have expectations with respect to the allocation of
authority between the court and the arbitrator.  What
they do agree to are conditions on consent that limit
the terms on which the state may be subject to
arbitration.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Blackman?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN I. BLACKMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BLACKMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This is a contract formation case, and it's
a case that is decided properly by the court below
whether you apply first options or whether you apply
treaty principles.  They get you to the same --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Blackman, may I ask
you, preliminarily, on your view, what happens next?
That -- can this party -- and suppose you're right --
can the -- can the BG Group institute an action in
Argentina and, if it's not resolved within 18 months,
invoke arbitration?
MR. BLACKMAN:  Absolutely, yes.  And my
friend conceded that.  There is no barrier.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And if it is resolved,
but not to BG's liking then, thereto, BG can invoke
arbitration?
MR. BLACKMAN:  That's absolutely correct,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, doesn't that mean
that the treaty partners agreed that only an arbitration
panel can conclusively resolve this dispute? Not a court.
MR. BLACKMAN:  What the treaty partners
agreed to here, Justice Ginsburg, was a condition -- a
precondition on their respectively derogating from their
sovereignty.  Absent the bilateral investment treaty,
there is no basis on which an investor could ever compel
one of these states to arbitrate its claims, and its
only remedy would lie in the courts of that state.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't -- I don't get
your answer to my question.  Am I wrong in thinking
that, under this treaty, the ultimate decisionmaker is
the arbitrator.  There is no provision for the court to
be the ultimate arbiter of the controversy?
MR. BLACKMAN:  It depends on the issue.  The
arbitrator will decide the merits, assuming the offer to
arbitrate has been accepted according to its terms,
which was never done here.
After that, depending on the issue, there
will or will not be judicial review of some kind, and
what this court said, as a matter of U.S. law in First
Options and what all the other countries say, and our
brief really was not disputed on that point, is that
issues of jurisdiction, whether a contract was ever
formed, whether there ever was an agreement to arbitrate
is ultimately an issue for a court to independently de
novo decide.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why are you
complaining about the other party not initiating
proceedings in the Argentine courts when, if you really
wanted those proceedings to occur, you could have
initiated proceedings in the Argentine courts?
MR. BLACKMAN:  First of all, as First Option
said, we didn't need to do that.  First Option was very
clear that it did not require someone who was resisting
arbitration and objecting to the arbitrator's
jurisdiction because there is no agreement to run to
court, which would also be very bad policy.
We don't want people running to court.  We
want them to try an -- an arbitration, but subject to
judicial review, if the arbitrators get it wrong on the
fundamental jurisdictional question --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I must say I
don't understand that.  When -- when you're appealing to
a condition for the thing to occur and you can bring
that about as -- as readily as the other side, it's --
dog in the manger comes to mind.
MR. BLACKMAN:  No.  We weren't the aggrieved
party, Justice Scalia.  We were not seeking relief.
They're the ones who were complaining.  We're -- we're
the putative defendant -- the Respondent.  There'd be no
reason for us to go to court.
What our offer to them was, was -- first
of all, you have to go to our courts for 18 months.  And
then it says, in 8(2), and it refers specifically to
"the aforementioned disputes," i.e., those disputes that
have been brought to our courts, those aforementioned
disputes can then be arbitrated "under the following
circumstances."
And the first of those, in 8(2) -- (a)(i)
is waiting the 18 months.  And then, quite importantly,
or in 8(2)(b) the parties can separately agree to
arbitrate.  Well, if they don't separately agree to
arbitrate, which did not occur here, you have to go
through 8(2), (a)(i), which is either wait the
18 months, so the local court can try to deal with it --
And I'll tell you why that's important in a moment -- or the
local court does actually adjudicate it and then the
party who's unhappy with that does have the right then,
and then only, to go to arbitrate.
And that's the temporal sequence that the
D.C. Court talked about.  It's set forth in the
structure of the treaty that the Chief Justice talked
about.  You go one, two, three.  They're in order for a
reason.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's -- the D.C.
Circuit treated this as there is no agreement until you
go to the local court first.
MR. BLACKMAN:  That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The argument is that
there is an agreement to arbitrate.  That will be the
method of dispute resolution.  You have to take certain
steps before.  So you have to go to the local court.
But why isn't the dispute settlement
mechanism decided upon by the parties' arbitration, and
then what you have to do before that is in the nature of
a procedural condition?
MR. BLACKMAN:  I don't -- I don't think
that's the correct analysis, Justice Ginsburg, because
the dispute resolution mechanism, which is, again, is an
offer made by two states to each other to --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Blackman, can I just ask
you to assume for a second that that's not so?  If you
had -- if BG and the Republic of Argentina had, itself,
entered into this agreement, would you agree that this
is a typical Howsam kind of provision?
MR. BLACKMAN:  I would actually not, Your
Honor.  Howsam -- let's talk about the facts of Howsam.
Howsam was -- there was no dispute that there was a
contract between the Howsams and the broker/dealer to
arbitrate under the NASD rules.  Those NASD rules,
themselves, contained an eligibility requirement that
the claim can't be more than six years old.
And those same rules also said the
arbitrators get to decide about the interpretation and
application of our rules.  So it was a
classic situation --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do you -- how do
you distinguish John Wiley, which I think --
MR. BLACKMAN:  John Wiley --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- has two components,
and the second cuts against you.
MR. BLACKMAN:  And the first cuts in our
favor, Justice Sotomayor.  That's exactly right.  My
friend kept talking about John Wiley as involving only
issues of procedural preconditions.  But the first part
of John Wiley, where the Court says, quite clearly, you
have independent judicial review, has to do with whether
there is an agreement to arbitrate at all between the
parties.
In that case, the parties sought to be
pulled into arbitration against its will, was a
successor -- and the issue which the Court independently
decided was, is that successor a party?
JUSTICE BREYER:  Everybody's getting to the
same question, I think, but I haven't quite heard the
answer.  Of course, you're right in many countries.  The
question of arbitrability, that is to say, is there a
contract is for the Court.  In an investment treaty, I
can find a lot of authority that says whether this
counts as an investment is a matter for the Court.
But the question in front of us, is this
that kind of decision?  Is it one for the Court?  Or is
it one for the arbitrator?  And to just summarize why it
might be for the arbitrator, A, it's procedural, but
that's not sufficient.  B, it refers to UNC -- whatever
it is -- UNCITRAL?
MR. BLACKMAN:  UNCITRAL.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  It refers to their
rules.  Their rules provide all matters of competence
over the arbitrator.  The scholars have done exhaustive
work saying most countries think that.  The Doctrine of
Competence-Competence goes further, and you also have
the AAA rules which say the same thing.  So those are
all against you.
For you is the position of the -- the item
in the document, first and foremost.  All right.  I'm
trying to summarize what I've got as the arguments for
and against.  Now, what do you say to make me think
there's even more for --
MR. BLACKMAN:  I agree with you.  The text
is key, and the text controls.  However, I strongly
disagree, with all respect, to your statements about
Competence-Competence and what other countries do
because we have shown, essentially, without dispute
here -- and this in the third restatement, and it's in
the case law of all these other countries, that
Competence-Competence or Competence-Competence, or if
you say it in German with a K, all that means is the
arbitrators get the first crack --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So I agree that's not --
MR. BLACKMAN:  -- it's not the last word.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But those are not
relevant -- I mean, those are relevant.  I'm saying they
would farther.  And I think, in what I've seen so far,
it gives, on certain kinds of procedural gateway
questions, deference to the arbitrator, which is what is
at issue here.
And now -- now, I'm back to the same
question.  What is your evidence from this contract that
this is not the kind of gateway question that is for the
arbitrator?
MR. BLACKMAN:  This is -- and, again, my
friend conceded this -- this is an offer to a unilateral
contract.  How does a unilateral contract get formed?
Here, we're back at our basic contract formation
principle.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think he conceded
it.  He conceded that that was your argument.
MR. BLACKMAN: Well I think -- then I misheard.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There's a subtle difference
between the two.
(Laughter.)
MR. BLACKMAN:  I misheard him.  I misheard
him then, and I apologize, Justice Scalia.  But this is,
in fact, if you apply ordinary contract formation
principles, as the Court says you must do in First
Options and in Granite Rock, if you apply those
principles, this is classic offer.
And the offer, we all know, has to be met by
an acceptance on those terms, not on other terms.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you said a few minutes
ago you were going to explain why this litigation
requirement is important.  And that is important to me
because I don't see what it accomplishes.  I can
understand a waiting period, but this is more than a
waiting period.
You have a party who doesn't want to
litigate in the -- in the courts of Argentina.  It
doesn't think it's going to get a fair shake there.
What is the point of requiring this -- now, I
understand, it's a requirement.
But if it's not very important, if it isn't
going to achieve anything, that seems to me to weigh
against the conclusion that it's a -- that it is a
condition of consent.
MR. BLACKMAN:  It is very important.  First
of all, as a factual matter, this type of requirement
appears in about 8 percent of bids, and it is most
prevalent in UK bids, so this is not some weird
Argentine thing.  The UK thinks this is important.  Why?
A number of reasons.
First of all, a lot of these investment
disputes -- in fact, the vast majority -- involve
challenge to some local law, some local regulation.  And
you want to have the local court have the first look at
construing it, just as you would construe a statute
before you reach the constitutional question.
The local court can illuminate the
dispute -- the investment treaty dispute by saying, what
does our law actually mean?  Is our law legal under our
Constitution?  That's one thing.  That's very important.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me just interrupt
before -- before the time expires -- but I don't
understand -- I don't know what the procedure is in
Argentina.  Let's assume their civil procedure is like
ours.
So you say they have to file a complaint.
All right.  They file a one-page complaint.  They do the
minimal necessary to keep the case alive in court.
Maybe they don't even do that because they don't care;
they don't want the thing to be -- to be decided.  All
they're doing is running out the 18 months.  What is
achieved by that?
MR. BLACKMAN:  Well, but that's their
choice, which they, in fact, made here, not to avail
themselves of the procedure --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's say they avail
themselves of the procedure in only the most perfunctory
way, so as to satisfy the 18-month requirement.  But not
for the purpose --
MR. BLACKMAN:  Why should my client be
punished because they don't diligently pursue a
requirement of our offer.  They say, actually, in their
brief, in one sentence, we accepted the offer and in the
next sentence virtually --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You're really -- you're not
answering --
MR. BLACKMAN:  -- they say we elected not to
follow --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you finish your
answer?
JUSTICE ALITO:  You're not answering my
question.
MR. BLACKMAN:  I'm sorry.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What is -- if they do not
litigate the matter in -- in such a way as to get a
decision on any of these local law issues, they just
keep it alive, perfunctorily, for 18 months.  What is
achieved by that?
MR. BLACKMAN:  Well, they have -- well,
they've complied with it.  But, more importantly, it's
what could be achieved if they wanted to achieve
something, which is, as I said before, constructions of
local law that would bear on the investment dispute.
That's important.
Narrowing issues, making determinations
which are not binding, but which are, nonetheless,
perhaps instructive and helpful to the arbitrators.
That's another issue.
Settlement is another issue.  We talked
about waiting.  We have EEOC.  You first have to go to
the -- to the commission because this, sometimes, gets
settled.  If it doesn't get settled, as I say, it can be
narrowed.  All kinds of things that would be helpful to
an ultimate arbitration.
And they could win, by the way.  They could
win.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Blackman, could you sort
of indulge an assumption for me?  And the assumption is
that, if this provision were in an agreement between two
parties, we would treat it as a Howsam-John Wiley kind
of provision; in other words, we would say that this is
just a procedural rule.  That's the side of the line it
falls on.
So my question to you is:  Why should this
be any different?  You're treating yourself as though
you never made an agreement.  But, in fact, you did make
an important agreement.  You made an agreement with the
U.K., the entire point and purpose of which was to allow
U.K. citizens to bring certain kinds of disputes before
an arbitrator.
So once we have a U.K. citizen with the
right kind of dispute, it seems to me you're just in the
position of any other person who's agreed to this
provision.  And in -- in my assumption, if it's a John
Wiley type provision, it should go to an arbitrator.
MR. BLACKMAN:  I have a number of responses
to that, Justice Kagan.  First of all, I don't think it
is just a John Wiley sort of --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I know, but I said just
assume that for me.  And tell me why you are in a
position where some other result should go into effect.
MR. BLACKMAN:  Well, it's kind of assuming
the conclusion, if this is just John Wiley, that's a
hard case for us, but the structure of the treaty, with
all respect, demonstrates it's not, and that would be
true even if this was, in fact, a contract between us
and BG.
If we had a contract with BG that says you
have to sue us first, okay, and then, after 18 months,
you can arbitrate with us, I don't think we would just
assume that that translates into you have to arbitrate
with us.  They're really suggesting here, Justice Kagan,
that this elaborate provision boils down to Argentina
promises to arbitrate all investment disputes with BG.
That's what it says.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the problem
is --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Please.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're -- it's a
point on which I'm regularly confused.  You just said if
we had this provision in a contract with -- a private
contract that said you must sue us, but there, you have
already a formed separate agreement to arbitrate.
And it seems to me clear that those -- what
do you call them, preconditions or whatever, that
that -- the argument that that's for the arbitrator to
decide.  They may well decide that -- you know, you
didn't comply, so you don't get to arbitrate.
But it seems to me, typically, under First
Options and Howsam, that is for the arbitrator.  Now,
what makes it distinct in your case?  What, is it just
the order that they're in?  Or what?  Or is it something
special about a sovereign's agreement?
MR. BLACKMAN:  It's -- it's kind of all of
the above.  It's the text, the fact that it is, in fact,
an offer by a sovereign, rather than an originally
bilateral agreement with the private party, but it's
also -- and this is much of what the case hinges on, is
this an issue of contract formation?
If it's an offer, it has to be accepted on
its terms.  And those are formation issues that go into
construing an existing agreement.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It all gets down to
the question, how do we tell -- you know, the contract
formation from the blue paper, right?  I mean, if it
says -- you know, we agree to arbitrate, and we use
these rules and those rules say you have to have it on
blue paper, and it's not on blue paper, they say, oh, we
didn't agree to have it not on blue paper.
How do we distinguish between those two
scenarios?
MR. BLACKMAN:  I -- I think you have to kind
of look at the language.  And, here, with all respect,
it was clear to the circuit.  I think it's -- we think
it's clear -- that the consent -- which, remember,
absent which there would be no arbitration, this is a
sovereign, going back to sovereign immunity in our
earlier case.
Where consent is expressly put -- the word
"consent" is not used -- but the clear language of the
text and the implications to be drawn from it clearly
show that the sovereign is not willing to arbitrate,
absent the 18-months' recourse to its courts, you should
view that as a condition precedent to a unilateral
contract that must be accepted by action.
And the action is to bring the suit in the
local court and wait 18 months.  An analogy, which may
not be helpful, but I thought of it, so I'll give it to
you.  If I'm looking for someone to paint my house and I
make an offer to him, I say, I'll hire you to do it if
you post the bond.  That's an offer to the unilateral
contract.
He has to post the bond.  He can't say, you
know, I really don't like the bond, or you want a
$20,000 bond, which isn't my offer, but I'll give you
ten; now, we have a contract.
But let's assume we now make the contract,
and I have progress payments in the contract.  Now we
have a signed agreement between us that says, I'll pay
you -- you know, $10,000 per floor.  That's the kind of
condition precedent within the contract that Howsam,
perhaps, addresses.
But the first one is the formation issue
that First Options addresses, did the Kaplans ever make
the contract --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what would
happen -- what would happen in this case if there was a
judge's strike, so none of the courts were operating in
Argentina?  What would happen then?
MR. BLACKMAN:  Well, all you have to do is
actually file.  So even if the courts weren't operating,
which is an extreme hypothetical, all you need to do is
file and wait the 18 months.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, but the clerk's office
is closed.
MR. BLACKMAN:  The clerk's office is closed,
too?
(Laughter.)
MR. BLACKMAN:  I suspect that the -- there
would be a very strong case to be made to the
arbitrators that, if the claimant, unlike here, did
everything it could to comply -- and here, remember, the
claimant deliberately "elected not to comply," the
arbitrators might well find that the condition was
excused and a reviewing --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, you can't -- no, you
can't say that.  You can't say that.  There is no
arbitration agreement under your -- it would still be
for the court.
MR. BLACKMAN:  Well, there could be an
arbitration in the first instance --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your -- your whole
argument gives me intellectual whiplash.  You have to
say --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- well, you have to --
you have to go first to the court because that's what
the arbitration mechanism provides, but there's no
arbitration mechanism.
MR. BLACKMAN:  No.  But, in this case, what
would happen would be what happened in First Options and
often happens, one party invokes arbitration, and the
other party says, I never agreed to arbitrate with you.
It would be very imprudent for the defendant in that
case to do nothing and default.  And you said, in First
Options, specifically, you don't need to do that.
So you present the issue to the arbitrators
and you would then argue that there's no agreement, and
the arbitrators would say, well, there is an agreement,
or a condition was excused.  And, ultimately, on
judicial review, on your facts, undoubtedly, a court
would be likely to find, well, of course, they did their
best, they tried to comply with a condition.
But that doesn't affect, to use my friend's
terminology, the question presented, which is who
decides in the first instance and then finally.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Goldstein, five minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, I do have
a rule that distinguishes the A4 paper, and that rule
should be, and we think it does follow from the analysis
of Howsam, which is just a thinking about when people
make agreements and what they expect is that an
arbitration agreement is formed and a party consents to
arbitration when they guarantee that the ultimate
decision can be made by an arbitrator and not a court.
It's forum selection.  We're going to have the ultimate
decision made by the arbitrator.
And that rule is applied in the investment
treaty context as follows:  And it is there is consent
to arbitration when the investor is guaranteed that
their claim can ultimately decide -- be decided by a
court, and the state can't force it to be ultimately --
excuse me -- by an arbitrator, and the state can't force
it to ultimately be decided by a court.
And I'll show you where that rule, how that
line is divided in this treaty.  And that is, I gave you
the three conditions at the beginning.  Those are not A4
paper.  You have to be a U.K. investor, you have to have
a treaty claim, you have to be suing another party to
the treaty.
And if those aren't true, then there is no
arbitration agreement and Argentina has every reason to
say I have no idea why these arbitrators are here, this
person's from Ecuador, not from the United Kingdom.
But on the other things -- at that point,
once -- we are a U.K. investor and we have invested in
Argentina, that's the performance that is required, once
we did that, then we are protected by Article 8, the
dispute resolution provision.
And you look at Article 8 and you say, okay,
does that guarantee that you have the right to
ultimately have it decided by the arbitrators?  Or can
Argentina actually insist that it will be ultimately
decided by a court?
And it's the former.  We made clear, I
think, and nobody disagrees, that they can't force us to
go into court and wait for that ruling, take that ruling
in any way, shape, or form.
Now, my friend says that, look, this is like
a unilateral agreement, and this is like where I say
I'll hire you to paint my house, if you post a bond.
Well, that is a terrible argument for them because this
treaty reads as if he was saying, I'll let you paint my
house if you post the bond or I post the bond, because,
remember, the thing they want us to perform on,
supposedly, is something they can do, too.
Whoever heard of unilateral agreement that
was conditioned on either party doing something? Thereâ€™s nothing theyâ€™re
waiting for us --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They say that only the
complaining party can bring a lawsuit.  Evidently, they
have no declaratory judgment procedure in Argentina.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That -- I don't believe that
is correct, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I was going to ask them
that.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I see.  I believe the
answer, when this was put to them, his answer to your
question was, I just don't have to do that.  His view
was -- and it's a perfectly fine position to take, and
that is he's not going to help me win my case.  Fine.
But it does describe whether this is a
condition on his consent, that he could do it, too, and if
he could do it, too, it can't be something that he is
waiting for me to perform at all.
I would also say that, on this question of
whether it has any value, that all that you got,
Justice Alito, was that, if I were to pursue the case in
the Argentine courts, maybe something would happen, we
might learn a little about Argentine law.
First thing's first.  I don't have to pursue
it.  Remember, his whole point is, when asked if the
courts were closed, he said, I just have to put the
piece of paper down.
So if this were a treaty provision that
actually involved litigation, involved exhaustion of
remedies, where we might learn something, that might be
a different case.  But this is a waiting period in an
Argentine court.
And, remember, as well, these are treaty
claims, and it is perfectly clear and undisputed that
the local court, even if it decided the treaty claims,
their ruling would not bind the arbitrators.  And so he
says, well, hey, we might win.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not so sure you
don't have to do anything, you just submit the paper.
It says you have to submit it to the decision of the
competent tribunal.  And if the submission requires,
okay, now, you have to file your brief, and you say, I'm
not going to, I'm not sure that you've submitted it to a
tribunal for its decision.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I
will then say that's a possible argument.  But let's
figure out who we would ordinary expect to figure that
out.
This is a treaty provision.  It's -- the
experts involved in treaty interpretation are the three
neutral arbitrators, who really do this every day.  It's
what they do.  They have enormous expertise in
interpreting treaties.
And so you might say -- and it would be a
perfectly valid interpretation, well, maybe submitting
it to the local court requires some activity.  But do we
really expect, when the U.K. and Argentina ended this
treaty, that it would actually be the Supreme Court of
the United States that would be deciding that question,
or instead, the arbitrators?
And if you believe it's the arbitrators,
then we win, because it's the kind of procedural
question that we put to them purposely.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That seems that
you're not totally circular in begging the question.  I
don't know that a sovereign would be anxious to submit
its sovereignty to three international law experts.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And, surely, they wouldn't,
Mr. Chief Justice, but that's the point of the treaty.
Remember, my friend said, look, if it weren't for this
treaty, we could never sue them.  That's the reason
there's the treaty because, if there wasn't the treaty
and we couldn't get relief from them, we would have
never invested.
And so the whole point of this treaty is to
put these disputes into arbitration.  There is no
special substantive rights in this treaty.  They are all
customary international law.  The thing that matters in
this treaty -- the thing that matters in all the
treaties is I don't have to have my case decided by an
Argentine court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
