CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

Hendrickson.
Ms. Ward.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WENDY M. WARD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. WARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The core of the liberty interest protected
by due process is the right to be free from unjustified
bodily restraint and harm.  It's hard to imagine
anything more inconsistent with these core rights than
the use of a weapon on a restrained detainee, and that
is why Respondents urge this Court to import a
subjective intent element that doesn't relate to due
process, but is instead drawn from the test for
violation of a convicted prisoner's Eighth Amendment
rights.
Respondents candidly admit that they favor
this test because it better insulates guards from
liability, but that is no reason to ignore meaningful
constitutional distinctions between those who have been
convicted and those who have not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why isn't the
safety of the detainee, why isn't that just a facet of
the use of excessive force?  I think that's how the
district court treated it.
MS. WARD:  The -- the safety of the detainee
was the stated objective for the use of the force in --
in this case.  And that is a legitimate interest, but
the determination of whether the -- the force itself was
excessive is based on the Bell test for legitimate
purpose, legitimate penological objectives.  So then the
test is objectively, then, whether or not the use of
force was excessive to the state -- stated need and the
Fourth Amendment test provides a -- a -- a good familiar
workable standard that can be used to determine that
question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You -- you mentioned the
Fourth Amendment now, but as I understand it, the
complaint just alleged a due process violation.  It
didn't -- it didn't refer to the Fourth Amendment.
MS. WARD:  That's correct, Your Honor.  And
-- and the Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process
test as articulated in Bell does provide the clearest
application by the Court of the rights of detainees in
the prison context.
And the Court has stated that Bell does
apply to the excessive force claims of pretrial
detainees and it makes perfect sense because, like a
prison policy that goes too far, it's easy to see how
a use of force can be administered as punishment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So suppose you have a
detainee being held in a prison population.  And --
is -- is your point that the prisoners can be punished,
but the detainee cannot be?
MS. WARD:  That's correct, under the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  Now -- now --
now suppose the prisoners are misbehaving.  They're
unruly.  They're yelling and throwing things at the
guards and the guards say, alright, lockdown for 24
hours; you can't go to the mess hall.  Now, the detainee
raises his hand and says, Oh, excuse me.  I'm a
detainee.  I -- I have a different standing.
Is that your -- is that what has to happen
here.
MS. WARD:  Yes, but –- but the problem with
the hypothetical is that the -- that's a legitimate
penological objective.  So under either test, neither
the prisoner --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That was my next question.
So there can be punishment for simply not -- in order to
maintain discipline within the prison population.  You
can be deprived of your exercise or your right to go to
the mess halls.  So you can, quote, "punish" for that
purpose, even if it's a pretrial detainee.
MS. WARD:  If it's a pretrial detainee,
you -- you can discipline for -- to enforce legitimate
objectives.  If it's a convicted prisoner, even harsh
conditions are --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You use the word
"discipline;" I use the word "punish."  Are they the
same?
MS. WARD:  They're not the same.  Punishment
is the end result of application of the Bell test.
Discipline is what happens to you if you fail to follow
the rules.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it doesn't matter if
the -- if the punisher, so to speak, is simply an
individual guard at the prison versus the -- the State,
which will run a prison that it knows has these cruel
guards.  It doesn't matter.  The -- the tortification of
the Due Process Clause, right?
MS. WARD:  Right.  It -- it doesn't matter.
And, in fact, guards are probably entitled to even less
deference than prison administrators who are making
policy for the Court.  In footnote 38 of Bell, the Court
acknowledged  that -- or suggested that individual
instances of abusive practices might be -- the guards
might be given --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It’s a substantive due
process you're arguing, right?  Not procedural due
process.
MS. WARD:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it's not the Eighth
Amendment.  You're not relying on the Eighth Amendment?
MS. WARD:  That's right, other than to
distinguish --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MS. WARD:  -- what you can do with a
convicted prisoner versus a detainee.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just have to tell you, I
find it very difficult to understand how it would be a
different standard if these same facts occurred, but it
was an inmate who was serving a sentence.  What -- what
is the rationale for why they should be different?
MS. WARD:  The rationale for why they should
be different is it's a -- it's an after-the-fact
analysis.  And the Constitution requires that detainees
not be punished.  And it allows --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Why is
anybody --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but you said that
they could be disciplined and now -- and that's --
MS. WARD:  I think the -- I think the
difference --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You use the -- I -- where
am I going to read to find a difference between
discipline and punishment?
MS. WARD:  I think the difference is
punishment is the result of applying the Bell
rationally-related test.  If use of force is not
rationally related to a legitimate objective, we can
define that as punishment.  If the act complained of
fails the Bell test, objectively, we can call that
punishment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But even --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm having a problem
with trying to understand why we're talking about a
difference between any of the Amendments, the Fourth,
the Fourteenth, or the Eighth.  The cruel and unusual
punishment, I thought, was generally -- generally
applicable to the sentence a prisoner receives.
That's very different than to the
application of -- of force separate from the -- from the
sentence.  We're talking about whether and under what
circumstances a prison guard or a prison is liable for
using unnecessary force on another person.
I don't think that taking any prisoner and
for no reason -- arbitrary reason banging his head on
the wall because you think that'll send the message to
other prisoners would be acceptable, do you, under any
of the Amendments?
MS. WARD:  That's correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So I -- I
just don't quite understand the difference.  I think the
issue is one, how -- how you instruct the jury.  And the
government is saying you instruct the jury by saying you
have a subjective intent to punish the prisoner -- you
just want to beat him up; or you're inflicting harm
that's not necessary or reasonable for a legitimate
penological reason, correct?
MS. WARD:  That's correct.  That's correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you have a different
standard than the government?
MS. WARD:  We do, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Then yours
is broader.
MS. WARD:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And explain why.  Why is
the government standard not good enough?
MS. WARD:  I misspoke.  I'm sorry.  I
misspoke.  We agree with the government as to what the
appropriate standard is, but we disagree with the
government as to how the standard was improperly applied
in the jury instructions in this case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That I -- I understand.
I'm just talking about the standard now.
MS. WARD:  We -- we are in agreement with
the Solicitor General on the standard.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if -- what if I don't
agree with the Solicitor?  Is there anybody here to
argue for a different standard?  No?  We -- we just have
to pick between two people who argue for the same
standard, right?
MS. WARD:  I -- I -- I believe the
Respondents have a different standard in mind, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  Okay.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it possible -- I
hadn't thought about it too much -- that you would have
different priorities in training, depending on whether
you're dealing with people who've already been convicted
of crimes and people who are being detained, like,
perhaps people who have been convicted tend to engage in
particular activity more than people just awaiting
trial?
MS. WARD:  I think the detainees can be as
dangerous as prisoners.  But as to your point about
training standards, currently, as the amici former
corrections officers point out, they are trained to an
objective standard.  And it's -- it's difficult to even
comprehend how you would train officers in view of
particular subjective maliciousness element.  Do you --
do you explain to them how they can use force as long as
they're not malicious, as long as they never admit to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I know -- of
course you're not going to say you can't act with --
with malice, but it would seem to me if the standards
are broader with respect to people who have been
convicted, you might tell the officers, look, you have
more flexibility with respect to people who are already
subject to a conviction.  You have to be -- you phrase
it the other way -- you have to be more careful with
respect to people who are simply being detained.
But it's very complicated in a case like
this because the Respondents make a very persuasive case
that the convicts are actually less of a threat than
the -- often than the pretrial detainees.  You go to --
you're going to go to jail if you've got 10 days on a
DUI or something like that, but the people who are
detained preconviction may be multiple murderers.
MS. WARD:  That's certainly true.  They
certainly may be dangerous folks who are deserving of --
you know, in the prison context, if they're dangerous
and -- and discipline needs to be imposed, that's --
that's a possibility.  The -- the question is:  How do
we evaluate their excessive force claims after the fact?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I still go back to my
question:  Why is there a difference at all?  What you
seem to be suggesting is that gratuitous violence,
unnecessary violence, can be directed to pretrial and
post-trial detainees.  Isn't your objection that
unreasonable, unnecessary force is not permissible?  Why
are we giving a license to prison guards to use
unreasonable or unnecessary force --
MS. WARD:  We are --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- against anybody?
MS. WARD:  I think I understand your
question, Justice Sotomayor.  Convicted prisoners
actually can be punished.  That is one of the legitimate
objectives with respect to convicted prisoners.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they can't be
punished corporally.  They can be denied good credit --
good time credit.  Do you think we could put them -- you
can knock them against the wall as punishment?
MS. WARD:  No.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not -- not in terms of
discipline.  It may be that some matter, immediate need
justifies that action, but are you suggesting that as
punishment they could do it for unnecessary force?
Unnecessary, not punishment -- or even punishment.
They -- they looked -- they -- they said the -- a bad
word to the prison officer.
MS. WARD:  The egregious use force will fail
both tests.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's what I wanted
to ask about.  As a practical matter, in evaluating
excessive use of force claims, how much difference does
it make whether there's a purely objective standard or a
subjective standard.  It will be the rare case, I would
imagine, where there's direct evidence of the officers'
subjective intent.  So the subjective intent is going to
be inferred from objective factors.
So what -- give me an example of an excessive
use of force claim that would involve the unreasonably --
a use of force that's objectively unreasonable, but there
is not the subjective intent to harm.
MS. WARD:  Mr. Kingsley's case might be just
such an example.  It was unreasonable for him to be
Tased, and under our jury instructions, the jury well
could have found that that use of force was
unreasonable.  But yet the subjective element that was
injected to our jury instructions could have made it --
it could have resulted in the -- the finding for the --
the verdict for the Respondents.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in a case where
there's -- where the jury thinks that there was force
that was objectively unreasonable, and in particular, if
it's a -- if it's a 1983 claim or a Bivens claim, where
the officer has qualified immunity, it doesn't seem to
me that there are going to be very many cases where the
difference between these two standards will result in a
different outcome.  Am I wrong?
MS. WARD:  I think you are wrong.  I think
that juries give a lot of deference to officers.  And if
they can -- if they're allowed to inject their
subjective good faith as part of a response to the
elements for proving the -- the case by the -- by the
prisoner, that would result in a lot more findings and
verdicts in favor of guards, even in instances where
objectively unreasonable, unjustified force is used.
In the – in the
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't see how you could
use excessive force -- unreasonably excessive force and
be acting in good faith.
MS. WARD:  Well, there's the issue -- the
issue of qualified immunity with respect to mistake of
law.  They could believe that the law actually allows
for them to engage in whatever use of force that
they're -- that they're using, but --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But no -- but we're asking
what the standard ought to be.  We don't talk about
qualified immunity until we know and until the officer
knows the standard.
MS. WARD:  Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And as of this point, I –
I do not know why the standard should be different for
convicts as opposed to pretrial detainees, other than
for purposes of rehabilitation.  And even that has to be
reasonable.  You want to us say that under these facts,
the result might be different, depending on if it's a
pretrial detainee or an inmate, and that's just very
difficult for me to understand why that should be.
MS. WARD:  It's -- it's -- using the
objective test for a pretrial detainee is faithful to
the Constitution.  It's faithful to due process.  Due
process talks about deprivations of life, liberty, or
property.  Deprivations are X.  The Eighth Amendment,
which governs the use of force with respect to convicted
prisoners, talks about cruel and unusual punishment.
There's a -- there's a -- an inherently subjective
element to cruel and unusual punishment.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But -- but Ms. Ward, you've
said a few times that we're supposed to be looking to
see whether something counts as punishment.  And in the
Eighth Amendment context, we've suggested that that term
"punishment" does indeed have a subjective component;
that it requires some kind of intent to chastise or to
deter.  So I'm a little bit with Justice Kennedy, that
I'm not quite sure what the word "punishment" is doing
in this context, but if we're looking for punishment, we
have indicated that punishment is a subjective concept.
MS. WARD:  Yes.  In the Eighth Amendment
context, because the word "punishment" appears in the
Eighth Amendment, but as it's used in Bell, it's
referring to X.  It's referring to evaluation of prison
policies or uses of force that go too far.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but you -- you -- you
brought punishment into this discussion.  We didn't.
Justice Kagan didn't.  Your brief is full of references
to punishment.  You say it's punishment that's bad.
You -- you want to abandon all of that?  That's --
that's not the criteria?
MS. WARD:  No, that is the -- that is the
criteria.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't understand it,
either.  It seems to me that there is some circumstances
where a guard is trying to punish someone, but there are
many circumstances where a guard has something totally
else in mind.  He's trying to keep order in the prison.
A policeman might try to stop a fleeing felon.  That has
nothing to do with punishment.
And so what a guard -- normally, the
provision that governs the policeman is the Fourth
Amendment.  I would guess that if you're talking about
trying to keep order in a prison, the Due Process Clause
may have something to do with it.  This person who may
be awaiting a lawyer is there, his liberty confined, and
you cannot use excessive force.
I – I  don't see what punishment had to do
with it.  But I -- but I did think, and I don't know the
answer, but I looked it up in the Model Penal Code, that
either the policeman who's trying to stop someone, or
perhaps the prison guard who's trying to keep order,
cannot use excessive force.
Now, what is excessive force?  It is force
that is objectively unreasonable.  Now, suppose he does.
The next question is:  Is a state of mind required?  We
can imagine -- it would be a weird case -- but we can
imagine a very weird case where the force is objectively
unreasonable, but the policeman is totally innocent.
Somebody told him, that is a Taser, but it's really a
gun.  He uses it.  Objectively unreasonable.  State of
mind, innocent.  Is he liable?
As far as I can tell, the government thinks
he should be.  As far as I can tell, you think he should
be.  End of case.  We just say everybody agrees.  Is
that where we are?  Because I'm rather worried about
holding the policeman in this weird case, where his
state of mind is a hundred percent innocent.  What here
happened is that they read in a little bit of
culpability, the least onerous subjective intent.  It's
called recklessness.  You have to be aware of the risk.
So I'm rather tempted to say, yes, there should be
something guilty about this policeman.  Now, there's
where I am at the moment, and I'd like you to explain
where I should go.
MS. WARD:  The Fourth Amendment doesn't
require any inquiry into the subjective state of mind.
And the Fourth Amendment test, in the case of a police
officer on the street, does the job adequately.  It
provides the adequate amount of deference, and it -- it
protects people from excessive uses of force.  That same
analysis can do the job in the prison situation when a
pretrial detainee's interests are at stake as well.  A
subjective intent element shouldn't be required of the
test at all, because that only comes in when there is a
question of cruel punishment.
JUSTICE BREYER:  At least in a prison, I
would think a prison guard would have a pretty tough
time thinking that if this person is in prison because
he's been convicted of a crime, I can try to control his
riotous behavior as long as I reasonably believe that
what I'm doing is correct, even if it turns -- but now I
have a totally different standard, where this person's
in the same cell, doing the same thing, but he hasn't
yet had his trial.  He's just there waiting for his
lawyer or he's been there because bail has been denied.
I -- I don't see how you administer such a rule.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the answer to that?
MS. WARD:  It's okay for the standards to be
different, because it's more faithful to the
Constitution.  It's okay for the analysis of the
excessive force claim in both situations to be
different, and -- and I will --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I -- I'm still
struggling because we're trying to create boxes in a way
that makes no sense to me.  There are all sorts of
reasons for doing things, and the Eighth Amendment cases
that we have, have to do with punishment qua not
bringing control, not responding to a prison outbreak,
or a fight, or anything else, but the types of
conditions that are imposed on prisoners as punishment,
i.e., you've broken an administrative rule, and now
we're going to put you in shackles in the dark dungeon.
We've already said in one case you can't do
that.  You may subjectively and legitimately think that
that will keep you constrained, but that's too far.
It's not -- it's unwanted and unnecessarily cruel and
unusual.  All right?
MS. WARD:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's very
different than this situation.  Whether it's a pretrial
detainee or post-trial detainee, I don't think the
Constitution gives you a free pass to punish a prisoner
by inflicting unwanted corporal punishment.  I'm not
talking about the conditions of -- of punishment; i.e.,
good time credit, solitary confinement, segregation of
some sort, deprivation of a prison job you have.  That,
clearly, you need an Eighth Amendment, sort of
subjective intent element.
I'm talking about the use of force for
purposes of restoring discipline.  That's what this was
about, wasn't it?
MS. WARD:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I keep saying why are
we thinking about the necessity to impose subjective
standards or any other standards or that they have to be
different?
MS. WARD:  I see that I have used my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
MS. WARD:  And can I respond --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
MS. WARD:  -- briefly?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
you an extra minute since --
MS. WARD:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
intruded on your time.
MS. WARD:  Thank you.
Sure.
We'll -- we'll give
-- the Court
The Court could decide that the standard for
all excessive force cases should be an objective
standard.  I think that the -- the jurisprudence related
to convicted prisoners has already shut that door that
require -- in requiring a subjective intent element for
a convicted prisoner, but it's more faithful to the
Constitution to actually give effects to the rights of
detainees which are much closer to the rights of free
citizens because they haven't received all of their due
process pursuant to a legal conviction.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Bash.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE
MR. BASH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
If there's one point I would like to convey
to the Court this morning which I think is responsive to
a number of questions that were asked in the opening
presentation, it's that there are two relevant
differences between the standard we're advancing and the
standard Mr. Clement is about to get up and talk about.
One goes to what sort of purpose is
required, and the other goes to how you establish that
purpose.
On the first, Mr. Clement says it is
malicious and sadistic intent.  We say it is a punitive
purpose.  It is clear as day in the Court's Eighth
Amendment cases, Farmer, Wilson, Whitley, that malicious
and sadistic comes from the wantonness requirement of
Eight Amendment, cruel and unusual.
He is just wrong about that.  The only
argument he has on that -- that it should be malicious
and sadistic is Judge Friendly's opinion that this Court
cited in a couple Eighth Amendment cases.  But if you
look at Judge Friendly's analysis -- this is on page 28
of the red brief -- he very clearly says that there's a
whole list of factors relevant.  Malicious and sadistic
is one factor.  It's not dispositive, and all of the
other factors are objective.
So I don't think you can extrapolate from a
few citations to Judge Friendly that malicious and
sadistic is appropriate for a due process claim for
someone who has not convicted of an offense.
And by the way, I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is a due process case,
right?
MR. BASH:  It --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not a Fourth Amendment
case, and it's not an Eighth Amendment case; is that
right?
MR. BASH:  That's correct.  Now, Justice
Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's just that you want to
bring into the due process analysis --
MR. BASH:  Justice Scalia, you characterize
it as substantive due process, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
MR. BASH:  -- I think a couple cases have
talked about it like that, but it's not exactly
substantive due process.  I mean, the rule this Court has
established is that before you go through the procedures
of the Bill of Rights conviction or a guilty plea and so
forth, you may not be punished.  So it really sounds a
little more in procedural due process than I think your
question gave it credit for.
Now, the other point is how you establish
that purpose.  Under the Eighth Amendment standards this
Court has set forth, it has interpreted cruel and unusual
punishment to require a degree of subjective intent.
Although it has used the term "punishment" to describe
the general legal standard under the Due Process Clause,
of course, that clause does not say the word
"punishment."  What's required --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and your -- your
standard in this case as to the pretrial detainee is
that he is entitled to what protection?
MR. BASH:  He is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what is your
standard?
MR. BASH:  It -- it's exactly what Justice
Rehnquist said for this Court in Bell, which is that
either an intent to punish, which I take to be shorthand
for an intent to achieve objectives that are -- are not
reasonable -- reasonable at that point for that person's
status in the system, or, objectively, there's no
reasonable relation between the use of force and those
objectives.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
The first one, that's the -- I mean, now you've run --
just run -- I could say the objective part has to be
objectively unreasonable force.  Now, the question is:
Is there also some kind of subjective part?  And at this
moment, it seems to me, on the one hand, you say, yes,
and on the other hand, no.
MR. BASH:  No.  I'm saying no on both hands.
It's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  No.  In other words --
MR. BASH:  It -- it is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- even though this man,
the defendant, is completely innocent, it wasn't his
fault in the slightest, he wasn't even negligent, the
guard is nonetheless liable.  I can't find anywhere --
not even in Fourth Amendment cases could I find a case
where that actually occurred.
MR. BASH:  Because, Justice Breyer, that's
not what we're saying.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.
MR. BASH:  I think the premise of the
question conflates two different types of intent.  And
this is exactly what the court of appeals did below.
There's the intent to actually do the act.  So if I --
if he had accidentally Tasered him --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Obviously --
MR. BASH:  -- or if --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- you have the intent to
do the act, that obviously --
MR. BASH:  But -- but --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- isn't the problem.
MR. BASH:  -- that was the premise of your
question about --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.
MR. BASH:  -- if you think it is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- it isn't.  It isn't.
MR. BASH:  Well, the Taser gun question -- I
mean --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Can I ask my question?
MR. BASH:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It is objectively
unreasonable.  But it is an odd case where the policeman
is -- or warden or whoever, is totally reasonable in
thinking the contrary, and that focuses you on the
question of whether there is some kind of either
purposeful, knowledgeable, or reckless, that being the
weakest, requirement in respect to the use of
objectively unreasonable force, not the act, but knowing
that it is objectively or reckless in respect to.  You
see?
MR. BASH:  Well, let -- let me describe
how --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to know what your
view is on that.
MR. BASH:  My view is this:  One, it has to
be an intentional act.  That -- that's the less --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's --
MR. BASH:  And -- well, and intent --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you mean -- do
you mean -- just to -- you mean voluntary?
MR. BASH:  Well -- well, not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not -- not a -- a
mistake with a Taser or gun?
MR. BASH:  And it -- no.  A mistake with a
Taser or gun would not be an intentional application of
force.  It would be a negligent application of force.
And I think under Daniels v. Williams -- that's the slip
on the pillow case case -- that would not count.
The question we're asking is:  What does the
connection have to be between that intentional use of
force and any legitimate penological objective?
And bear in mind, the officer has to know
all the relevant facts.  So if you have an eggshell
prisoner who has some special medical condition that
nobody knows about, that's not going to bear on the
constitutional analysis.  It's the facts that the
officer is aware of.
And I think what this Court's decisions in
Bell, Block, say is that an objectively unreasonable
deprivation of liberty violates the Due Process Clause.
And just as confirmation that that is an objective
standard in both Bell -- this at page 561 -- and
Block -- this is a page 585 -- the Court said there's
not even an allegation here that there was a punitive
intent or some ill intent.  Therefore, we're going to
analyze it under an objective test.
And the opinion --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is this different for
inmates as -- as opposed to detainees?
MR. BASH:  Because what the Due Process
Clause --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the test for
inmates?  You -- you don't apply the same test.
MR. BASH:  The -- the malicious and sadistic
intent test that Mr. Clement is asking you to apply to
pretrial detainees.
But remember, this would probably not only
apply  to pretrial detainees, certainly not only
pretrial detainees in mixed populations.  It would also
probably apply to immigration detainees, juveniles who
have not been subject to a criminal punishment, and a
host of other people who have not gone through the
rigors of the Bill of Rights, who have not been
convicted of a crime, and never --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you agree that the
pretrial detainee can be deprived of -- of privileges
because of bad behavior that's disruptive to the
confinement?
MR. BASH:  Yes.  And that's what I was
getting at when I said the way that I think Justice
Rehnquist used the term "punishment" in the due process
cases is as shorthand for a deprivation of liberty in
the prison context that has no reasonable relation to
any legitimates objectives.  So if it was --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't
persons who were being arrested and persons who have
been convicted and are incarcerated have the same due
process rights as detainees?
MR. BASH:  Because the Due Process Clause
permits the punishment of people who are convicted.  And
as this Court interpreted that in the context of
convicted prisoners, it's that convicted prisoners may
be subject to hasher conditions than pretrial detainees.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it's -- so it's okay
to use excessive force in the case of a prisoner,
somebody who has been convicted?  I mean, the question
here is did -- what did the police -- was it
objectively unreasonable to use the extent of force that
was used in this case.  So are you saying that in the --
in the case of a convicted prisoner, that it would be
okay to use excessive force?
MR. BASH:  Well, it probably almost always
violate the Eighth Amendment if there was an actual
intent to punish, and the punishment was carried out by
the use of force.
But I think often what we're talking about
is these cases on the margin, where the officer maybe
had mixed motives or whatever.  And the idea behind the
Eighth Amendment jurisprudence is that we're going to
amp the standard up when you're talking about someone
who is subject to the penological force of the State.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you give us an example
of what a guard could do to an inmate and a guard could
not do to a pretrial detainee, other than for
rehabilitation purposes?
MR. BASH:  I don't think the use of force as
discipline is ever appropriate.  But, you know, in a --
in a max prison where you only have felony convicts, I
think, at the margins, officers are willing  to be able to
use slightly more force than they can with pretrial
detainees where people who are held, as this Court said
in Salerno, in regulatory detention.  Admittedly --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I think it's
pretty unusual, isn't it, to have a pretrial detainee in
a maximum security prison?
MR. BASH:  No.  I -- I was just trying to
identify for Justice Kennedy how the standard at the
margins might be different, so when you're talking
about --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you come up with
a hypothetical, I think, is quite unrealistic, so I'm
not sure it's responsive.
MR. BASH:  I – I didn't mean to come up with a
hypothetical.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm even not sure why
that's right.  Why -- you get a free -- the Constitution
permits you to get a free kick in?
MR. BASH:  That -- that's -- that is
certainly --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if you walk by a
prisoner and, you know, I want to establish discipline
so I can freely kick them any time I want?
MR. BASH:  That's certainly not what we're
saying.  What we are saying is that the prohibition on
what officers can do to convicted prisoners is they
cannot punish them cruelly and unusually.  And it makes
sense that this Court has upped the subjective intent
standard with respect to convicted prisoners because it
reflects that the constitutional prohibition is only
cruel and unusual punishment.  Here is a --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Bash, would you
explain?  I mean, you agree that it's only the objective
standard, use of excessive force, but then your bottom
line is the same as the Respondent, that is, you think
that this -- this verdict should hold and it should not
be any new trial.  Can you explain how your bottom line
is the same as Respondent, but your standard is the same
as Petitioner?
MR. BASH:  I would take the Court to page
277 and 278 of the Joint Appendix, which lists the
pertinent jury instructions.  And the -- the jury was
instructed to find four elements, three of them no one
is contesting at this stage.  The third one is the key
element.  This is on page 278.  And it said, "Defendants
knew that using force presented a risk of harm to
Plaintiff, but they recklessly disregarded Plaintiff's
safety.  If it" -- full stop there, I would agree you
naturally infer that, at least on this review, as
importing a subjective element.  But then it tells you
exactly what recklessly disregarded Plaintiff's safety
means.  By failing to take reasonable measures to
minimize the -- the risk of harm to Plaintiff.  And I
see that as no different than the proportionality
standard that Bell itself requires.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Clement.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This Court should adopt -- adopt the
subjective test fashioned by Judge Friendly in Johnson
against Glick in addressing a due process claim for
excessive force by a pretrial detainee.
This Court has already adopted that standard
in the Eighth Amendment context for convicted prisoners,
and both doctrinal and practical reasons strongly
suggest that it should apply the same test in the due
process context in which that test originated, and the
contrary propositions are simply not compatible with
this Court's precedents.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In Johnson and Glick, the
bottom line was that there was reliability; isn't that
so?
MR. CLEMENT:  No, Justice Ginsburg.  The
bottom line was a remand so that there could be a -- a
factual determination based on the Four Factor Test that
Judge Friendly articulated.
So in the lower courts, they dismissed the
claim.  Judge Friendly recognized that the Due Process
Clause does provide protection, and then he articulated
that Four Factor Test, one important part of which is a
subjective factor that, I think, sensibly tries to
distinguish those situations where an officer is trying
to use force in a good faith effort to maintain order
and discipline and contrast that with a situation where
the force is being used sadistically or maliciously for
the very purpose of inflicting pain.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if we look at
this -- this case, the conduct was deliberate, using the
Taser was deliberate.  The effect known to the officer
was that it would cause pain.  So what subjective
element other than when using -- I'm deliberately using
force, I know it will cause pain.  What beyond that?
MR. CLEMENT:  So the question is:  Is this a
good faith effort to try to get these handcuffs off, or
is this somebody who's acting simply to punish the --
the detainee?  And I think that's what the good faith
test really gets to.  It gets to what, I think, in some
respects is the nub of the issue here.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, let's put the nub
of the issue here.  Let me give you the fact -- let's
use this actual situation.
The -- the defendant says, I wasn't
resisting, I wasn't spreading my arms apart, I was just
laying there, and they came and Tased me.  All right.
The officers say instead he was pulling his arms and
resisting it so we couldn't get the handcuffs open.  So
assuming a jury credits the Petitioner, what would that
do under -- how would that be evaluated under your test?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I suppose that if the
jury actually credited Petitioner's versions of events,
they might be able to find liability under the John --
Johnson v. Glick standard.  I think it's worth recognizing
that there was a jury trial here, and under a recklessness
standard, they ruled in favor of our clients, and it
seems to me that it would be very odd to have to have a
new jury trial.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's go back
to -- that's why I keep trying to go back to what is
the -- what are the -- under what circumstances and how
does your test get to the gratuitous use of violence or
the excessive use of violence where it's unnecessary?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think it gets to it in
a way that provides a degree of deference to the
difficult decisions that the guard has to make, which is
it recognizes that unlike the arrest context in other
situations, prison environment's different.  There are
going to be lots of situations where guards are going to
use force and legitimately.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that instruction is
going to be given anyway.
MR. CLEMENT:  What's that?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under -- under the Bell
v. Wolfish case, that presumption was given anyhow.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, but I -- I don't -- I
mean, I think there are real differences between the
instruction, and if you look at – the way -- the clearest
way to illustrate this is if you look at Joint Appendix
page 78 and you look at the instruction that was offered
by the Petitioners below, it flat out says you can't take
into account the good faith intent of the officer.  It's
irrelevant.
Now, I think that's perfectly appropriate in
a Fourth Amendment instruction where there's objective
reasonableness, and this Court said a bunch of times
that the subjective intent of the officer doesn't
matter.
But in the difficult context of a prison, I
think Judge Friendly got it right, I think this Court
got it right with respect to convicted prisoners, which
is you give the guard a little bit of flexibility
because it's a difficult situation.  And if you say
after the fact, maybe they shouldn't have used the
Taser, or if, in a case where they used the Taser twice,
maybe they should've used it once, but not twice, those
questions of degree ought to be some degree of
deference.
This test allows for that.  It gives a jury
a landing place.  If they look at this in hindsight and
say, you know, I wish they hadn't used the Taser, but I
think they were doing it to get the handcuffs off.  This
isn't a case like Hudson against McMillan where they
were just taking the guy out and beating him up
punitively.  So I don't think there should be a
Constitutional violation here.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's true -- you
know, what you say is equally true where you're running
a jail, isn't it?  And it's equally true where the
person in the jail is -- has been convicted or hasn't
been convicted.  The need for order is the same.
So how would it apply in a circumstance
where there's a claim of excessive force to someone who
has been convicted, but it has nothing to do with
punishment.  No one thinks it has to do with punishment.
The situation was one where they were trying to maintain
order, or the situation was one where they were trying
to give medical treatment, or the situation was any one
of a thousand.
What I can't see is why the punishment
standard should apply whether he's been convicted or
not.  And I also can't see why they should be different
whether he's been convicted or not.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think the punishment
standard applies in both cases, Justice Breyer, because
the relevant constitutional text has been interpreted to
require punishment.  In the Eighth Amendment context --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But suppose you brought a
lawsuit under the Due Process Clause?  I mean -- and
there are instances where people are seized in jail, so
it was under the Fourth Amendment.
I mean, why is punishment in these other
situations?  I can't figure that one out.  I can't
figure out -- and then I looked at the Model Penal Code.
The Model Penal Code seems to require both excessive
force and some kind of state of mind, which could be
recklessness, which is what the judge said here or maybe
even negligence.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, obviously, if you adopt,
as this Court has in the Eighth Amendment context, the
understanding that punishment inherently requires some
subjective mental state, the lowest available mental
state is recklessness and under that standard, which the
jury clearly was instructed under, we would prevail.  So
that would lead to an affirmance.
Now, I would still think, since it is
well-established that the relevant standard for
excessive force in cases involving convicted prisoners
is the Johnson v. Glick standard, I think since that's
established and nobody here is asking for Whitley or
Hudson to be overruled, and there are so many practical
imperatives for treating pretrial detainees and
convicted prisoners the same, I think this Court should
apply the Johnson v. Glick standard in the due process
claims of pretrial detainees.
In a subsequent case, if the Court wants to
reconsider what the test should be even under the Eighth
Amendment and apply it uniformly across pretrial
detainees and convicted inmates, that may make some
sense.
I also think there's some very interesting
questions lurking out there about what kind of objective
evidence of unreasonableness is enough in an Eighth
Amendment case, or if we prevail, a Fifth Amendment
case, what kind of objective evidence is enough to get
to the jury on the subjective intent question.  I think
those are all questions that this Court may eventually
have to confront, but I think the first step in a case
where nobody wants to overrule Hudson and Whitley is to
suggest that since the imperatives that the officers
face with respect to pretrial detainees and convicted
inmates are essentially identical.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is that?  Why don't you
tell us why that's so?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I'll -- I'll tell you
why that's so.  And it's so in these -- particularly in
a -- in a local jail like Monroe County, Wisconsin,
where you have these individuals, they're housed side by
side.  As the Chief Justice has alluded to, in this kind
of jail, the only way you can serve their sentence as a
convicted individual is if you've been convicted for a
relatively minor offense.  But if you're there pretrial,
awaiting your trial, any -- any -- any book -- any --
any offense in the criminal book could be your charge of
-- that -- where you're being held for, so it could be a
murderer.  And I think this Court has recognized, and
this -- I mean, this is empirically true -- this Court
has recognized this empirical fact, first in Bell
against Wolfish, then in Block against Rutherford,
and -- and more recently, in the Florence County case.
When you --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement, sorry.  There's
a lot to what you say that sometimes the practical
concerns are the same for pretrial detainees and for
convicted criminals.  There's also something to the
other point of view, which is that in our cases, we've
consistently said that if you're a pretrial detainee, if
you haven't been found to have committed wrongful
conduct, you shouldn't be treated the same way as people
who have been found to have committed wrongful conduct;
that for the convicted criminals, it's kind of, you
know, we're allowed to punish them, because they've done
something wrong.  And we haven't found that yet for the
pretrial detainees.
And so what place in your system is there
for that, you know, very commonsensical, and also, you
know, normatively attractive proposition that people who
haven't been found to have done anything ought not to be
treated with the same level of disregard for their
interests as people who have been?
MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Kagan, there is a
place for that in the doctrine.  I would submit it's not
in the excessive force cases.  So let me tell you where
I think it is.  I mean, Sandin against Conner is a good
example.  There the Court said that with convicted
individuals, it was perfectly permissible to move them
from minimum security to maximum security as a punitive
matter, and you didn't even have to give them any
process to do that.  I don't think that same analysis
would apply to pretrial detainees.
Another example is footnote 17 of the Bell
against Wolfish case, where I think it's understood that
at least if the statutory law provides for it, that if
you're convicted, you can be sent out to the work gang
and have to pick up trash along the highway.  I don't
think you can do that to a pretrial detainee.  But
whatever differences there are, I don't think they arise
in an excessive force context.  I think if you think
about this Court's cases, and start with Whitley.  If
you're trying to quell a prison riot, and you have an
inmate who's going up the stairs, trying to go where
there's an unarmed guard, it doesn't make a whit of
difference whether that inmate is a pretrial detainee or
a -- a -- a convicted individual.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that might be, but let's
take another comparison.  And the comparison is two
people who have been indicted for the same offense, and
one makes bail and he's out on the street, and the other
doesn't make bail, and so he is in an institutional
facility.  And the one who's out on the street has some
kind of encounter with a police officer, and he reaches
into his pocket to take out something, and the police
officer shoots him.  And let's just imagine that
circumstances are such that this is utterly
unreasonable.
And then the same -- the same person
indicted for the same offense, not convicted of that
offense, same circumstances, the police shoot him, now
he's not going to be treated in any respect the same
way.  Why should that be so?
MR. CLEMENT:  I think because the fact of
incarceration really is a game-changer.  When that
person's out on bail, nobody is going to know that, so
he has exactly -- or she, the exact same expectations as
any reasonable individual.  The same expectations as the
individual in Graham v. Connor, who's doing nothing more
than trying to buy orange juice in a convenience store.
There are rules that apply to that, and they
should be sufficient and they should be objective, and
that's the Fourth Amendment standard.
When you're in the incarceration context,
things are different.  The margin for error for the
guards is quite different.  The need to protect the
other inmates from a potentially violent person doesn't
have the same kind of direct analogue when something's
unfolding on the streets.  Sometimes it can, but the
quarters, I think, are -- are going to be different, in
the main, in the incarceration context.  And so I think
it makes sense to apply a standard that's slightly more
forgiving of the prison guards than of the police
officers.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I -- I still find it
very hard to understand how use of force can be excessive
without being at least reckless.  It's -- it's confusing.
For excessive use of force, but yet what -- what does the
reckless add to it?  If -- if it's an excessive use of
force, isn't that at least reckless by definition?
MR. CLEMENT:  I think often it will be.
We're not here to defend the recklessness instruction as
the platonic sort of form.  We actually think that
applying Judge Friendly's instruction from Johnson
against Glick is the right way to go, which we think
provides a little more separation between the two.
I don't think, though -- I mean, we can --
we can obviously come up with hypothetical situations
where there are going to be different applications.  I
think the principal difference here is this instruction,
both in the Eighth Amendment context, and in the due
process context in Johnson v. Glick, I think it gives
the jury a practical landing place when they think, you
know, with the benefit of hindsight, I wish the police
-- I wish the corrections officer hadn't done that, but
I don't think it was completely outside of the bounds of
what was reasonable.  I certainly don't think it's so
purposeless and so arbitrary that it gives rise to an
inference that it had a punitive motive.
That gives the jury kind of a reasonable
landing place, and I think this case is actually a
pretty good illustration of this.  I think if you look
at this and you ask yourself, was it reasonable to use
the Taser?  That's a debatable question.  Was it really
punitive?  Was it unrelated to an interest in trying to
get the handcuffs off?  Of course not.
And so I do think in cases like this, it
gives the jury an appropriate landing place to come up
and make a judgment that doesn't second guess the
officers.  And this Court has said so many times that
deference to prison officials is an important value.
And I think this test that we've proposed that, again,
originates with Judge Friendly in a due process case
gives --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you're giving --
you're -- you're loading the deck completely, because
you're instructing the jury first to give the police
officers deference, and then you're now giving them an
instruction that assumes that whatever they do is okay.
MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think so.  I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, there's no --
there's -- by adding that kind of subjective intent that
you want, maliciousness and wantonness, which are not --
are only one part, as your -- as the Assistant Solicitor
General said, only one part of the Johnson test.
MR. CLEMENT:  But -- but if I -- if I
could --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're -- you're -- the
way you've articulated in your brief has really loaded
the deck completely.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, in -- in fairness, and
to correct the Assistant Solicitor General, the
instruction we asked for, which is at Joint Appendix 65,
it has all of the Johnson factors.  Now, it focuses, as
we think -- and that's the pattern jury instruction in
an excessive force case for a prisoner in the Seventh
Circuit, we think it gets it right, which is it focuses
the ultimate inquiry on this, is it a punitive intent or
is it a good faith effort to restore order.
But then if you look for the factors that
the jury can consider, all four -- all the rest of the
Johnson factors are there.  And we think that's actually
the best reading of Bell v. Wolfish, too, which is to
say it provides objective factors, but then it's
basically asking, you can look at those objective
factors and it allows –
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that –
MR. CLEMENT: -- you to infer a punitive intent.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Bell v. -- Bell v.
Wolfish, the first part of the application section of
that opinion goes to whether there's an intent to
punish.  It assumes there's not, and then it goes to the
objective test and says, in that particular case, that
the conditions met that -- those conditions as well, but
it treated it as alternative.  That's --
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think alternative ways
to prove a punitive intent.  And if you look at Bell v.
Wolfish, when it talks about those objective factors, it
then says, so if you have purposeless or arbitrary
government action, the court may infer an intent to
punish.  So it's objective factors in service of what is
ultimately a subjective inquiry.
The other thing I think that needs to be
added, though, is that Bell v. Wolfish, you know, we
think we win under it.  But it is a test that was really
designed to judge some conditions questions.  And we
think Johnson against Glick, and we think, in the -- in
the Eighth Amendment context, Whitley and -- and Hudson,
are directed at the unique dynamic that you have in
excessive force cases.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Am I right that the
pattern instruction in -- in this case, the pattern
instruction asked only the excessive force question,
asked the jury to decide whether the force was excessive
in light of the particular facts and circumstances?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, okay.  So there were two
pattern instructions, neither of which were used.  There
was the pattern instruction which my friends wanted to
have, which was the Fourth Amendment pattern
instruction.  There was the pattern instruction that was
the Eighth Amendment standard that we wanted to have.
And Judge Crabb essentially split the difference and
came up with this nonpattern jury instruction that asked
the excessive force question, and baked in this notion
of recklessness.
Now, we think obviously that the lowest
standard of intent that could be compatible with the Due
Process Clause is recklessness, and so we think you
should affirm if you think recklessness is the standard.
But in fairness, we think the most coherent way to
approach this issue is to apply a single unitary
standard to pretrial detainees and post-convicted
inmates when you're talking about these kind of
excessive force claims.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement, why not look at
it this way?  I mean, you said -- and it's really the
basis of your argument -- that being in an institutional
setting is the game-changer.  There's no doubt it's
important.
But there's another potential game-changer
as well, and that is this question of have you actually
been convicted?  Has the legal system found that you're
a person who is a wrongdoer?
So if we say that both of these things are
important, why shouldn't we adopt a set of principles
that say it is -- we're -- we're looking for objectively
reasonable conduct, but in looking for that, of course
we take into account the prison circumstances.  Of
course we take into account the context in making that
evaluation, so that the person on the street does not
necessarily come up with the same result as the person
in prison because the contexts are different.
But still, the test, the basic test is the
same because they are both people who have not been
found to have done anything wrong.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, a couple of responses,
Justice Kagan.  I mean, obviously, you could try to take
the Fourth Amendment test and you could adjust it -- try
to adjust it for the prison conditions.
We don't think that that's going to work in
a way that gives sufficient deference to the prison
officials.  We do think -- this Court has said so many
times they are in a unique environment.  It's not
something that the normal jury is going to have any sort
of insight into.  So I think if you just ask them was it
reasonable in hindsight, I don't think you're going to
get sufficient deference.  So that's one reason.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I would think that the jury
would give a lot of deference to prison officials, in
part because they are unfamiliar with the circumstances.
And folks will come in and will say, you know, here's --
I think that there's -- that -- that that will be the
natural tendency.
MR. CLEMENT:  I mean, I hope you're right
for the sake of my clients, but I think that tendency is
going to be embodied much more if you let them take into
account good faith.  And I think that's a really
important way of thinking about the question here,
because if you look at their proposed jury instruction,
at JA 78, it's the one thing the jury is told they can't
take into account, is whether there was good faith.  And
that does not seem particularly productive.
Another point you made was that, you know,
there is this difference that these individuals are --
have not been convicted.  And I do think that's
important, and I've talked about a couple of instances
where I think that that makes an outcome-determinative
difference.
But you also have to take into account that
the Bell decision itself said the presumption of
innocence has nothing, really, to do with this.  And I
think that was a reflection of the reality that when
the -- an institution is trying to deal with pretrial
detainees and inmates, it's not dealing with different
entities.
Another thing I'd like to say about Bell v.
Wolfish is I do think it's an analysis that applies most
readily to conditions cases.  And there are a number of
cases we cite in footnote 9 of our red brief involving
the lower courts' applications of various tests
requiring subjective intent.  There's a D.C. Circuit
case called Norris against the District of Columbia.  I
paid more attention on rereading it because I noticed
that Justice Ginsburg had written the opinion.
It's decided in 1984, and I think it's
actually quite instructive because in 1984, the D.C.
Circuit had the benefit of Bell v. Wolfish.  It also
had the benefit of Johnson against Glick.  And when it
confronted an excessive force claim, as opposed to a
conditions claim, the D.C. Circuit looked to Johnson
against Glick and not to Bell v. Wolfish, which it
doesn't even cite, to provide the relevant standard.
And I think that just shows that
Judge Friendly got this one right.  He has an analysis
that of course looks to objective factors in terms of
the amount of force used, the need for the force, the
relationship of the two, but also says, was this a good
faith effort to maintain or -- or restore order, or was
this something that was just sadistic and malicious with
the intent to cause harm?
My friends from the Solicitor General
Office, I guess, don't like the words "salist -- sadistic
and malicious."  I looked them up.  I mean, they sound
kind of rough, but they actually -- you know, Judge
Friendly got that right, too.  I mean, they're words
that basically mean exactly what he said in the rest
of the sentence --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if you really --
MR. CLEMENT:  -- which is there's no
intent --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- if you really --
MR. CLEMENT:  -- other than to cause harm.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- want to take the
Judge Friendly test -- and I guess you've talked about
this before, but it is a multifactor test where the
question of sadisticness is counting as a plus factor,
a thumb on the scales.  But it's clear under that test
that even if that sadistic quality isn't there, it's
still allowable to hold the prison official to have
violated the law.
MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I don't think that's the
right reading of it, which is I think the ultimate
question under that test, and that's certainly the way
it's been applied by this Court in the Eighth Amendment
context, and you see that in this pattern jury
instruction that we propose.
The ultimate test is, is this a good faith
effort to maintain order, or is this an effort to
inflict punishment just for the sake of punishment?  And
then the rest of the factors inform that as, of course,
they always would.
And I think one way of thinking about the
question before the Court in this case is that this
Court has already borrowed the -- the Johnson v. Glick
factors that were due process factors -- they've already
borrowed them and used them in the Eighth Amendment
context.
And the question in this case is should they
take that due process test and apply it in a due process
case?  And that doesn't sound like a difficult question,
and I really don't think it is.  I think this Court got
it right in Hudson and Whitley.  You think about those
cases.  Whitley, it wouldn't matter whether or not that
individual going towards an unarmed guard was pretrial
or post-conviction.  But in Hudson it's the opposite.  I
mean, Hudson is this case where you have somebody who is
singled out for a punitive beating in response to an
altercation with the guard.
Again, it makes no difference.  That's not
acceptable behavior, whether or not they are an inmate
who's been convicted or pretrial detainee.  Applying one
test to both of these very similar individuals seems to
be the appropriate response.
If there are no further questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WENDY M. WARD
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. WARD:  Thank you.
Justice -- Justice Kagan got it exactly
right.  The institutional setting is not the
game-changer.  The game-changer is the fact of lawful
conviction pursuant to due process.  That's -- that's
the -- the dividing line between the right test and the
wrong test.
Justice Ginsburg also was looking at
recklessness in our jury instructions, and you -- you got
it right also.  Disregard -- reckless disregard of
someone's rights has no place in a jury instruction that
should be objective.
And I want to step through the jury
instructions because we part ways with Mr. Bash on the
jury instructions in particular.  If you look at -- part
of the confusion comes in in the three different uses of
recklessness in the jury instructions, as the dissent
below noted.  There's three different ways that
recklessness is used.
If you look at 277 of the Joint Appendix,
the first use of recklessness is that force is applied
recklessly.  Well, here we're asking whether force is --
force is less than deliberate if you look at how force
applied recklessly is -- is used in Farmer, for example,
deliberate indifference.  You're looking at -- you're --
you're conflating deliberate indifference with a
deliberate act.  That's confusing.
And Question No. 1 of the special verdict
questions, excessive force means force applied
recklessly that is unreasonable.  So the -- again, this
is what I was talking about, force applied recklessly;
that's also not deliberate.
And then the -- the plaintiff is required to
prove each of the following factors by a preponderance
of the evidence.  Factor 2 is the reasonableness test.
Factor 3, which is in addition to the reasonableness
test, is reckless disregard of plaintiff's safety, which
is, again, a different use from acting recklessly.
And -- and it's that reckless disregard for plaintiff's
safety language that the Court said in Farmer was
unquestionably related to a culpable state of mind.
And then if there's any question about
whether reckless in our jury instructions were related
to a bad intent, the third use of recklessness, which is
on 278 about halfway down the page, acted with
recklessness disregard of plaintiff's rights.  The jury
instructions defined that specifically not in the -- the
special verdict itself, but in the -- the instruction on
punitive damages, which is found on page 281, where the
court said to the jury that an action is in reckless
disregard of plaintiff's rights if, under the
circumstances, it reflects complete indifference to the
plaintiff's safety or rights.  If you find that
defendant's conduct was motivated by evil motive or
intent, unquestionable bad intent related to that
element of reckless -- or that version of recklessness
that was used in the jury instructions.
If the Court has no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
