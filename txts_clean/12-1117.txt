CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
this morning in Case 12-1117, Plumhoff v. Rickard.
Mr. Mosley.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MOSLEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MOSLEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Sixth Circuit completely failed to
analyze the second prong of a qualified immunity defense
in this case, and that is whether the law was clearly
established at the time of the incident in question,
such that every reasonable officer would know whether or
not the action was constitutional or not.  Therefore,
the petitioners were not given fair warning that the use
of force in this case, if it was prohibited, was
prohibited, and they retain immunity, and the Sixth
Circuit must be reversed.
This is the argument we -- we wish to
emphasize today relating to the second prong, what was
traditionally the second prong before Saucier, of
course, the rigid order of battle was changed.
Had the Sixth Circuit reviewed its own cases
as of 2004, it should have concluded that Petitioners
were entitled to qualified immunity.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought it said -- did it
not say in its opinion that there was room for
disagreement or whether this was reasonable or not?  Did
they have some such statement?
MR. MOSLEY:  They could not conclude that it
was reasonable as a matter of law is the statement I
recall, Justice Scalia.  And -- and in that regard,
that's a legal question.  It had to answer that
question, but it didn't do so with reference to prior
case law of 2004.  If anything, it looked at Scott v.
Harris from 2007 and said that there was a factual
distinction between Scott, and the devil was in the
details; and, therefore, it affirmed the district court,
which, I submit, made the same mistake because the
district court was looking at Smith v. Cupp from the
Sixth Circuit, which was a 2005 opinion, to determine
whether or not the officers violated clearly established
law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would the court, in your
view, ever have an occasion to decide whether conduct of
this nature violates the Fourth Amendment?  If you --
you were right about clearly -- clearly established,
then could this -- could the underlying constitutional
question ever be, what would be the posture of the case
in which it could be decided?
MR. MOSLEY:  Well, I mean, we've argued, of
course, in our briefs, Justice Ginsburg, that it should
be decided in this case, although today we're
emphasizing the second prong.  But what would be the
posture of such a case?  The United States has suggested
that there's factual complexities in this case that make
it difficult for the Court to rule whether or not, on
the merits, there was a constitutional violation.
And I'm not -- of course, we -- we differ
with that to the extent that we've argued there was not
a constitutional violation.  But as in Pearson where the
issue of whether the law was clearly established can be
resolved relatively easily, I submit that -- that in
this case, that is the case, and the Court should rule
that Petitioners were entitled to qualified immunity.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it the case that the
court has discretion to reach the second prong if it
wants to?  The court could say it wasn't reasonably --
it wasn't clearly established, but it was an
unreasonable seizure.  It could do that, couldn't it?
MR. MOSLEY:  The way I read Pearson, Justice
Alito, no.  The way I read Pearson, they -- Pearson's
dictate is that they must proceed to the second prong if
they conclude there was sufficient facts to conclude
that there was a constitutional violation.  They still
have to decide -- one is a question of --
JUSTICE ALITO:  No, that wasn't my question.
The -- the court has to, ruling on qualified immunity,
it has to decide whether there -- whether the law was
reasonably -- the rule that's being applied was
reasonably -- was clearly established.  But having done
that, even if it says it was and, therefore, the
defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, doesn't
Pearson say that the court has discretion about whether
to go on to the second prong?
MR. MOSLEY:  Oh.  This is in relation to
Justice Ginsburg's question.  I think so, yes.  The
court certainly has the power to -- to make a ruling on
the merits question.  And in this case, if the court
found it wise to do so, we've argued that on the merits
this was a constitutional use of force under the Fourth
Amendment, because it was dangerous.  The -- the chase
exceeded speeds of 100 miles an hour.  There was weaving
in and out of traffic.  There was a time when a
particular person pulling a boat was -- was cut off.
Even in the parking lot, the Respondents' decedent never
threw his hands up, never indicated surrender,
maneuvered his car in such a manner that a reasonable
officer could conclude that he was in a threat of
serious harm to himself.
In any event, every reasonable officer could
not -- it is not correct that every reasonable officer
would not conclude that it was unconstitutional.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there -- is there
any situation in which the application of lethal force
during a high-speed case in your view would not be
justified?
MR. MOSLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Give me an example?
Talking about a high-speed chase, not unlike this one.
Is there -- is there any situation in which it would --
would violate clearly established constitutional law for
the police to use lethal force?
MR. MOSLEY:  Well, I'll give you one
circumstance.  If -- if this Court had a case where it
ruled where there was a prior ruling, of course, that
given conduct violated the Constitution.  But as far as
me coming up with a -- a particular event, I suspect
that somebody fleeing at the speed limit, not
endangering other drivers.  I hate to use television as
an example, but perhaps the way the white Ford Bronco
fled in the early '90s that everybody saw on TV.  That
seemed to be relatively non-dangerous or at least not a
danger of serious physical injury.
In this case, however, there was a danger of
serious physical injury, given the undisputed events in
this case.  In fact, the Respondents below argued that
the speed exceeded 100 miles an hour.  They argued this
was a dangerous chase On page 16 of their memorandum in
response to our motion for summary judgment.
So, you know, of course, there's a
jurisdictional issue here that I'd like to briefly talk
about.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, I'd like you to talk
about that.
MR. MOSLEY:  Well, the -- below in the Sixth
Circuit, the Petitioners were willing to concede any
alleged factual disputes, not legal dispute, but factual
dispute, in the light most favorable to the Respondent.
We're still willing to do that.  For purposes of
argument's sake, any alleged disputes should be
construed, which is proper under Scott v. Harris, to
determine the -- the historical facts in the light most
favorable --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And is that -- is that how
you think the jurisdictional question should be
resolved, that whenever -- as you know, there's --
there's a disagreement in the courts of appeals as to
what you do when there are claims that there are factual
disputes.  Some courts -- well, we've held that where
the only issue raised is a factual dispute, there's no
jurisdiction.  Some courts say that so long as you
assert a claim to qualified immunity, there is
jurisdiction, okay.
Let's assume that that's the rule.  What do
we do with factual disputes?  Is it your position that
you -- you simply assume them to be in the -- in the
Respondents's favor?
MR. MOSLEY:  Only to the extent supportable
by the record, as Your Honor held -- as this Court held,
rather, in Footnote A of Scott v. Harris.  So yes, I do
think that there are cases where --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you would say genuine
factual disputes.  I mean, if -- if there's something
that is not at all frivolous.  I mean, it's not
supported by the record, I wouldn't call that a genuine
factual dispute.
MR. MOSLEY:  I think it wastes judicial
resources if there is not true genuineness with respect
to a particular fact, if there is no support for it in
the record and clearly established, the argument has
been raised for the court not to go ahead, assume
jurisdiction and assume the facts in the light most
favorable to the extent supportable by the record, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and how does that
work out here?
MR. MOSLEY:  In this case, I --
respectfully, I don't think it's very important.  I
think that there are maybe a couple of alleged factual
disputes that, even if you assume them in the light most
favorable to the Respondent, they do not affect this
Court's analysis under the second prong of qualified
immunity because this was indisputably a dangerous car
chase and indisputably the Respondent never gave up
before force was used.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You would say that it
doesn't really matter whether he bumped the police
cruisers when he was finally cornered, whether he tried
to back up into one of the officers, that all of that is
just excrescences, that it was enough to justify the
shooting that he was driving at 100 miles an hour,
swerving around the road, endangering human life and
would likely continue that if they let him to get away?
MR. MOSLEY:  Two responses, Your Honor.
First of all, I do not concede that those facts are in
dispute.  Rather, if you look at the second volume of
the Joint Appendix towards the end, the Respondent had
admitted those in the Supreme Court -- in the summary
judgment record below, that there was some
qualifications that these are legal disputes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Had admitted what?
MR. MOSLEY:  Had admitted that Officer
Gardner's car was, in fact, bumped by Respondent
decedent's car, that the cars were rocking back and
forth, that the front wheels were spinning.  That
occurred.  That was indisputably occurred.  That
indisputably shows on Unit 286, which is Galtelli's
video.  And then, it is indisputable that Officer Ellis
had to step out of the way when Mr. Rickard backed up.
Those things were not in dispute.
So, you know, as that goes, I wouldn't say
that those things have to be assumed in the
Respondents's favor because those things happened and
the Respondent doesn't take issue with those things.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, he does in his -- in
his briefing here.
MR. MOSLEY:  He -- he takes issue with
characterizations.  And what I -- I submit is that we've
characterized facts in this case, no doubt.  They've
characterized facts in this case.  Just as in Scott v.
Harris, the videos in many ways speaks for itself.  The
video in many ways -- in every way, in my opinion, shows
that this was dangerous.  It continued to be dangerous
and Mr. Rickard never relented and never gave up.
And one important fact that is also
undisputed is that at the time that that contact,
however you characterize it, was made between the
Galtelli car and Mr. Rickard's car, Officer -- I mean,
Gardner's car and Rickard's car, Officer Gardner was
exiting his patrol car.  So there was much made about
the fact that Officer Plumhoff was to the side, the
front side of the car.  Well, Officer Gardner was not to
the front side of the car.  Officer Gardner was exiting
the car that was being contacted and approaching in
front.  That is a danger -- at least a reasonable
officer on the scene without the benefit of hindsight,
without -- out of the quiet of the courtroom could
conclude that he was in danger of serious injury.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Assuming -- assuming that
at some point in this case, either now or on remand,
it's appropriate and necessary for us to state -- set
forth what the rule ought to be, what effect, if any, do
you give to the fact that there was a passenger in the
car, a passenger who apparently was not involved in any
illegal activity?
MR. MOSLEY:  The passenger did not make
Mr. Rickard less dangerous.  However, I know of no legal
framework as of 2004 -- I do understand your question is
about the merits.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it makes the police
reaction more dangerous.
MR. MOSLEY:  It does.  But we still look at
the relative culpability of the driver.  We look at
the -- I do think under the totality of the
circumstances, you consider the fact that there is a
passenger, but you also consider the -- the rights of
the innocent public.  And it did not make Mr. Rickard
less dangerous.  I agree with you.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I could see how the
passenger could complain, but -- but I can't see how
the -- how the -- the criminal fleeing felon who put the
passenger in danger can say, you shouldn't have shot
because you -- oh, you hurt my passenger.  Isn't there
some problem of his standing to complain about that
problem.
MR. MOSLEY:  Precisely.  And -- and we've,
of course, argued that it -- it defies logic to me for
Mr. Rickard to have put Miss Allen in danger and then
invoke her safety as a reason why he -- he should be
free from the use of force when he is endangering the
innocent public.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did Allen bring a suit?
MR. MOSLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And was that settled out
of court or something?
MR. MOSLEY:  No, Your Honor.  That remains
in the Western District of Tennessee.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Oh, it remains.
MR. MOSLEY:  And the issue there, of course,
is under the Fourth Amendment, the "shocks the
conscience" standard.
But as of 2004 in the Sixth Circuit -- go
back to what I'm emphasizing here today in the second
prong -- there wasn't a -- a case that suggested that
the driver could invoke the passenger's safety as some
means to suggest that the force was excessive.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  I understand that.
Although we're going beyond the necessities of the case,
is the rule that the passenger can have a "shock of the
conscience" test and it's not limited to the Fourth
Amendment, even if the driver is?  Is that the way it
works?
MR. MOSLEY:  Well, it's interesting.  The
circuits go various ways.  The Sixth Circuit has
vacillated on the issue of whether there's a Fourth
Amendment claim of an un -- of an unintentional
unreasonable seizure, which to me defies logic.  But
there is clearly a "shocks the conscience" standard
in -- under Lewis v. Sacramento the "intent to harm"
standard under the Fourteenth Amendment.
We were granted summary judgment -- the
Petitioners were granted summary judgment as to
Miss Allen's claim, estate's claim, in that regard, but
the court is now reconsidering in the Western District
of Arkansas the Fourth Amendment -- of Tennessee, the --
the Fourth Amendment claim.
The Respondent -- for the Respondents' part,
they haven't shown clearly established law violated in
this case by Petitioners' actions.  And it's important
that, if not stopped in this case, I think reasonable
officers could conclude that Rickard would continue to
pose a risk.
Now, what's important about the prior case
law to 2004 in -- in the Sixth Circuit is that those
cases -- Smith v. Freland, Scott v. Clay County, in the
Eighth Circuit the case of Cole v. Bone -- those
officers at that time didn't shoot when somebody was
about to run over someone else.  There was not an
immediate threat that somebody was -- just like in Scott
v. Harris.  Officers often wait for a time to take
action when they don't see civilians around.  And to
suggest that, you know, somebody has to almost be run
over before deadly force can be used in a situation
where serious harm or injury has been threatened would
throw law enforcement into chaos  and I respectfully
submit it would probably weaken law enforcement in this
country.
I'd like to reserve the remainder of my
time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
Mr. Mosley.
Mr. Bash.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. BASH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I think the correct disposition of this case
follows from two propositions:  One, there is some level
of reckless driving in response to a police pursuit that
authorizes the use of deadly force, some level, at a --
in a high-speed chase.  Second, it was not beyond debate
in 2004 in the relevant circuits here that the driving
that the undisputed facts show in this case would have
authorized deadly force.  It might have been wrong as a
matter of the Fourth Amendment, but it was not clearly
established.  Respondents have not pointed to a single
circuit case that would have given officers clear notice
that the undisputed conduct here would not authorize the
use of deadly force.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Bash, could I go back to
Justice Ginsburg's question, because this is an area in
which there's no alternative way really to develop legal
standards other than by doing it in these kinds of
cases.  So if we only focus on the clearly established
upon case after case after case, we don't make much
progress in actually telling police officers where the
line is.  So how do we do that?  Why shouldn't we do it
here?  When should we do it?
MR. BASH:  I think the general point is
correct, and as we say in our brief, it would hinder the
development of constitutional law if courts never
reached the merits question.  And as the Department of
Justice, we have an interest in that, because we
prosecute State officials for civil rights violations
and there's a similar standard of "clearly established"
in the criminal context.
Our only point here is not that courts
should never reach the merits in these cases; it's that
this is a particularly bad vehicle, particularly for
this Court, which even in -- in nonqualified immunity
cases often lets difficult constitutional issues
percolate among lower courts.  One, the lower courts and
really the parties didn't distinguish between the
different officers here.  Three officers didn't fire
their weapons.  Maybe they're the easy case.  But two
officers, although it might be disputed whether assaults
occurred, heard over the radio that assaults occurred.
That's what they say in their affidavits.  That's at 213
through 225 of the JA.  And you can here on the Galtelli
video, which is 286, that he heard the report of the
assaults.
That's a wrinkle in the constitutional
analysis that really hasn't been explored by the lower
court opinions in this case and by the briefs in this
case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Bash, that
question about the development of the underlying law,
that's an issue that we faced and decided when we
overturned the prior rule that there was a particular
order of battle and you had to decide the Constitutional
issue first, isn't it?
MR. BASH:  That's true, Mr. Chief Justice.
But what Pearson said is that, as Justice Alito said
earlier, it's discretionary.  And one of the factors
Pearson urged lower courts to consider in deciding
whether to reach the merits question was whether this is
the sort of issue that doesn't often arise in a context
other than where qualified immunity is available, and I
think that's what Justice Kagan's question was getting
at.  It can arise in some other contexts.  For example,
if there's a policy, a municipal policy that authorizes
the use of force, you can oftentimes sue the
municipality and they're not entitled to qualified
immunity.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They -- they have in
fact sued the municipality in this case, haven't they?
MR. BASH:  They -- they have.  I believe
that -- well, they sued the chief of police.  I think
they sued the municipality, too.  But I don't think this
was pursuant to an explicit policy.  In fact, some of
the policies at issue here -- they're in the JA at 398
through 412 -- I think might have been violated.  So I
don't know this is going to be the case where they can
reach the merits because of municipal liability.
One other point on this question of the
development of the law.  I mean, Justice Kennedy noted
in his dissent in Camreta v. Greene, even clearly
established cases sometimes can -- can sort of more
incrementally develop the law because certain principles
are discussed in the cases --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I ask -- could I
go back to a question the Chief asked earlier, which is,
is the use of deadly force always permitted in a
high-speed chase?
MR. BASH:  We don't --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's assume a set of
facts that's different from here, that they had
surrounded the car and it had not moved.  Could they
have done what the police officer did here, fire into
the car to get the guy to open up the door?
MR. BASH:  Well, the use of deadly force is
justified to protect injury to the public or to the
officers.  And if the circumstances of the case show
that he has, the suspect, has no means of escaping and
getting back on the road based on where the cars are at
the time of the stop --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could have been in a
ditch or something?
MR. BASH:  -- and there's no argument that
the officers were in danger -- or maybe the vehicle is
disabled -- no.  It's not punishment for having engaged
in a high-speed pursuit.  It's to protect people on the
road.
This case, it's pretty -- it's very clear on
the video that he was aiming to get back on the road.
The district court found that.  It's undisputed.  And he
could have kept driving if the officers hadn't fired
shots.  Now, maybe, even taking all that into account,
maybe it violated the Fourth Amendment here.  Maybe his
conduct just wasn't dangerous enough.  But I don't think
it would have been beyond debate that it violated the
Fourth Amendment in 2004 in these circuits.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Bash, what's the
government's position on the jurisdictional question?
MR. BASH:  We think there is subject matter
jurisdiction in this case.  And let me explain both how
I see the Johnson framework generally and then how I
think it applies here.  Johnson said that on an
interlocutory appeal in a qualified immunity case,
appellate courts do not have jurisdiction to review
questions of evidentiary sufficiency.  In other words,
does the summary judgment record permit a jury to find a
certain fact?
I think there's two qualifications or -- or
caveats to that.  One, in Scott v. Harris, although the
Court didn't review Johnson, it said if the facts found
to be disputed by the district court to be genuinely
disputed is blatantly contradicted by the record, in
particular, their video evidence like we have here, the
court doesn't have to credit that.
Second, I think there are certain sorts of
issues that are in this context understood to be legal
issues, not factual issues.  So the factual issues are
the historical facts, how fast was he driving, what was
he doing, that kind of thing.  But the question of what
level threat he posed to the public or to officers I
don't think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  I understand that.
But what -- what about a dispute as to the purely
factual issues, if there is a dispute about that?  Does
that mean the court can't -- can't take the case?
MR. BASH:  As I understood Johnson v.
Jones, it said that.  Now, Johnson v. Jones was based on
practical considerations about conserving judicial
resources and the nature of the question at issue.  I
think as you'll see -- as you see in this case and as
the State amicus brief in this case makes clear, lower
courts have struggled with that issue and it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I know that.  How would you
resolve this struggle is what I'm asking you.
MR. BASH:  Well, like you said in Johnson v.
Jones, we think that Johnson adopted the incorrect
position, and if it was properly presented in a case, we
would ask that the Court reconsider the precedent.  But
that hasn't -- that hasn't been raised here, but
obviously, it's within the Court's power to do so.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is your point that if
Johnson -- is your point that if Johnson remains on the
book, there's no jurisdiction?
MR. BASH:  No, there is jurisdiction in this
case, because on the undisputed facts it was not clearly
established in 2004 in the relevant circuits that these
officers could not use deadly force.  It's not necessary
to reconsider Johnson to decide this case.  The
undisputed facts, and I'm happy to go through them, make
clear that it was not clearly established in 2004 in
this case.  I took Justice Scalia to be asking a broader
question about how Johnson has worked in practice in the
lower courts.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but Johnson involved
only disputed facts.  They asked this Court to resolve
the factual question, period.  I understood Johnson to
say of course you can't take that.  But we have here a
case where, although there may be disputed facts, the
other side would say -- or your side would say that they
are irrelevant.
MR. BASH:  If the Court were to hold that on
a core sort of qualified immunity appeal that actually
raises the question about clearly established, that
appellate courts have jurisdiction to consider
subsidiary factual questions of the sort that I think
you're referring to, we would agree with that position.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  And you would agree
that we should resolve them in the Respondent's favor to
the extent that the record supports that?
MR. BASH:  Correct.  It would be the normal
summary judgment standard.  We don't -- we don't think
there are facts resolved in the Respondent's favor here
that are necessary for the outcome in the context of
this case.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Bash, could I ask you a
question?  Putting aside the "clearly-established" prong
and if you were just looking at the reasonableness of
this conduct straight, the Fourth Amendment violation,
two factors, and tell me how the government thinks they
both play.  One is the degree of force involved, the
fact that 15 point-blank shots were fired, and the other
is what Justice Kennedy referred to before, the
passenger in the car.  So how do those two factors play
in the Fourth Amendment question?
MR. BASH:  Let me start with the latter.  I
think that the -- you can see arguments both ways on how
the passenger fits in.  On the one hand, Scott talked
about the number of lives at risk and the relatively
culpability of people being put at risk.  And so you can
see how the officer's actions are putting an innocent
person at risk.  Maybe that plays in.  But on the other
hand, as Justice Scalia said, it's a little bit weird as
a constitutional rule to say that the suspect put
somebody else's life in danger and gets a greater
immunity from suit.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It is a little bit weird.
But as I understand the way the lower courts have done
this is to say that the passenger actually doesn't have
a Fourth Amendment claim, so there is a "shock the
conscience" test, which is, of course, a very high
standard.
MR. BASH:  That's true.  And it's only the
district court so far that has ruled on the passenger's
Fourth Amendment claim here, and she may have an
argument on appeal under Brenlan v. California that she
was seized.  Brenlan says if you pull over -- you know,
not through the use of force, through just an ordinary
stop, pull over everybody in the car, if the passengers
feel like they are not free to leave, they are seized as
well constitutionally.
We haven't evaluated it on the facts of this
case and how that applies to the sort of force used
here, but she may have a Fourth Amendment claim, and it
may make sense to filter those sorts of concerns about
the innocent passenger through her claim rather than
giving the suspect who actually put her in danger a
greater immunity from the use of force.
And I think the other question you asked me
about was --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  The degree of force.
MR. BASH:  -- the degree of force.  And I
think that's part of the reasonableness analysis in the
sense that officers generally should use only as much
force as is necessary to end the threat, and sometimes a
lesser degree of force will be sufficient.  But in this
case, at least as a matter of what the law was -- in
this case, the suspect probably would have gotten away
before the police could use less force.
I'll end there.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Bash.
Mr. Smith.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY K. SMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SMITH:  Chief Justice Roberts, may it
please the Court:
This case is a classic jury question.  There
are, contrary to the Petitioners' and amicus position,
several genuine material issues of fact that are
absolutely in dispute, and I would like to recite a few
of those to set the preface to respond to some of the
questions that have already been raised.
We start with the fact that there was no
chase at the time that these shots were fired.  The
chase had stopped.  This situation was a controlled
environment, not perfectly controlled,
but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I did see
the film, and most of the -- there were the three
initial shots and then the shots after the car was
moving away from the police officers.  How could you say
most of those 15 shots were in a stopped, controlled
position?
MR. SMITH:  The last 12.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The last 12.  Let's --
MR. SMITH:  The first --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- divide it --
MR. SMITH:  -- the first three were.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- between 3 and 12.
MR. SMITH:  And that's one of the points I
would like to make, Justice Sotomayor, is that we have
to separate the shooting sequences in this case.
Officer Plumhoff fired the initial three shots while the
car is stopped and is blocked on three sides.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why do we have all
these other officers in here?  They didn't fire any
shots, Forthman, Ellis, and Evans.
MR. SMITH:  And that issue has not been
asked at the district court.  It has never been raised
by the Petitioners in this case that they should be
treated separately.  The Sixth Circuit -- the Sixth
Circuit recognized that in the footnote.  And that is an
issue that should be presented to the district court, I
would submit.  But if we separate --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Go back to -- let's take
the sequences.  What was wrong with the 12 shots fired
at the car as it was driving away?
MR. SMITH:  Okay.  That's the first point of
what was wrong, is that there was no danger at that
point to the officers, and the only, the only excuse or
justification that the officers could utilize at that
time, because they were shot as the car was driving away
and going down the street, the danger at that point that
is being created by shooting is to the general public.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what do you think the
officers should have done at that point?  What should a
reasonable officer do when there has been a high-speed
chase and the car spins out of control?  And forget
about whether there was any attempt to ram anybody or to
hit to anybody with the car.  The car spins out of
control.  It's eventually surrounded by officers with
guns pointed at the driver demanding that he get out,
that he put up his hands, stop driving.  They are
pounding on the -- on the windows of the car.  And the
driver then begins to drive away.
What does a -- what do reasonable officers
do?  Maybe they -- what they should do is to continue
the chase indefinitely.  I don't know.  What do you
think?
MR. SMITH:  The first part of your question
brings in the first sequence when Officer Plumhoff
shoots the first three shots, and you reference, Justice
Alito, the statement that he is trying to get him to get
out of the car, show his hands, etcetera.  The video
shows that that could not have happened.  Officer
Plumhoff gets out of his car drawing his weapon and goes
to the car and immediately shoots.  No delay, period.
He immediately begins to shoot.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The car is still trying to
escape.  The car is not stopped and, you know, the
driver with his hands up.  The car is still trying to
get out of this encirclement by the other police cars,
right?
MR. SMITH:  That --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is he trying to get away at
that point or not?
MR. SMITH:  You can't tell because he is up
-- he is bumper to bumper with the Gardner car.  It is
true that the wheels spin forward.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What do you mean?  He is
going to the police station?
MR. SMITH:  Well, we don't know.  He wasn't
given the opportunity.  What we do know is this:  There
is evidence in this record from which a reasonable jury
could conclude that he may have been trying to give up,
because Officer Forthman, who was the one that struck
him and spun him out, says that once he turned onto
Jackson Avenue he hit his brakes hard.  Now, he didn't
hit his brakes hard in order to get away from him.  And
at that point, Officer Forthman says that caused him to
hit him and spin him out.  And at that point, the
momentum of his car caused the light contact between he
and Plumhoff, who was moving toward him, as well.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He had just -- he
had just exited the interstate.
MR. SMITH:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And so isn't that a
good reason for putting your brakes on?  He is not going
to be going 100 miles an hour down the side street, is
he?
MR. SMITH:  No, no, no.  He is well off the
interstate.  He has made at least four and maybe five
turns since he left the interstate, and he is turning
from north Danny Thomas to northeast on Jackson Avenue,
which sort of borders into it.  He has already made the
turn before those brakes come on, according to Officer
Forthman.  Now --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Smith, I was -- I was
surprised to read what you said in your -- in your brief
on page 25:  At a minimum, reasonable minds could differ
on the issue of the Petitioners' objective
reasonableness.  And that -- isn't that enough to decide
this case?
MR. SMITH:  I respectfully submit no,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say that, even though
what they did was arguably reasonable, right --
MR. SMITH:  That is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- immunity does not apply?
MR. SMITH:  That statement, not prefaced
correctly and perhaps inartfully, is simply saying this:
That if you use the Rule 56 standard to view the facts
in the light most favorable and thus you creat a jury
question, reasonable minds can differ with the jury.
They could find for us, they could find against us.  But
it is not to say --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We don't it to the jury
about whether, you know, whether the police officers
violated the Fourth Amendment or not.  The rule is if --
if indeed there is no clear violation on their part, if
they had no reason to know that what they were doing
violated the Fourth Amendment, they are entitled to the
immunity.  And here you have that statement at a
minimum, reasonable minds could differ on the issue of
their objective reasonableness.  Do you still believe
that, that reasonable minds could differ on the issue of
their objective reasonableness?
MR. SMITH:  It says at a minimum.  And
I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  At a minimum.  At a
minimum.  I mean it could be even worse.
MR. SMITH:  That's addressing the
constitutional issue, not the clearly established issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't care what it's
addressing.  It's addressing a state of facts, that
reasonable minds could differ on the issue of
Petitioners' -- do you want to take that back?
MR. SMITH:  And it -- no.  Because any --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think you ought to take
it back.
MR. SMITH:  -- any time there is an issue,
any time that there is a genuine issue of material fact,
it can be resolved either way.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, objective
reasonableness is a -- is at least a mixed issue of law
and fact, and it seems to me Justice Scalia is correct.
You -- you have the burden to show that this was a
clearly established standard, and you say that at a
minimum, reasonable minds could differ on the issue of
reasonableness.
MR. SMITH:  That's not what that was
intended to convey.  It's clearly not what that was
intended to convey as you can see from the entirety of
the brief.  If I can get back now to -- to the material
genuine issues of fact that are in dispute, keep in
mind, Officer Plumhoff, who shot those first three
shots, did not do it to prevent the car from leaving
again.  He said the only reason that he fired those
three shots was because he was standing directly in
front of the path of that car and he thought he was
going to be killed; and the video 100 percent shows that
that is not true.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But I thought the
reasonableness of a Fourth Amendment seizure was an
objective question, not a subjective question.
MR. SMITH:  It is an objective question.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So why does it matter what
reason he subjectively had?
MR. SMITH:  He has to have some
justification of danger under objective reasonableness
to make the decision to use deadly force.  And he says
that it was because he was standing in the path of the
car.  He wasn't.  That car was bumper to bumper against
the Gardner car.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I know.  But if he --
he says I did it because I thought he was going to run
me over.  But an objective officer looking at the
situation would say that the use of deadly force is
necessary here to prevent this chase from continuing on
the interstate and endangering other motorists and their
passengers.  So if that were the situation, wouldn't
that mean that was a reasonable seizure?
MR. SMITH:  I believe it would not be.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Initiated by the fact by the
officer who used the force had a different motive?
MR. SMITH:  No.  I'd respectfully submit,
Justice Alito, that it would not because if that's all
there was, there were other alternate methods to stop
that car from leaving.  It wasn't the reason that he did
it; but if you assume that you can analyze it on that
basis, there were several alternate ways to prevent that
car from leaving.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Such as?  What?
MR. SMITH:  You're standing right there
beside the car, you can -- you can disable the car with
the gun.  You can shoot the tires.  You have --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are officers -- are
officers trained to use their weapons to shoot tires?
MR. SMITH:  They're trained to -- they are
trained to use weapons and they are trained to use --
these officers trained to use all safer alternatives
before using deadly force.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, are they
trained -- are they trained to use their weapons to
shoot out the tires of fleeing cars?  My understanding
is that that's not appropriate police behavior.
MR. SMITH:  It is more appropriate, I would
submit, than -- than shooting the person.  But they also
have other alternatives here.  He's blocked on three
sides.  The only thing he can do is back up.  There are
four cars to his left -- I mean, excuse me, to his
right.  They have the ability to block him from the
rear.  There were -- there were alternative means.  They
could have done --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Smith --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They didn't block him.  He
got away.  How can you say they had the ability to block
him?  He got away, didn't he --
MR. SMITH:  But they -- my point is they
could have.  The other thing they could have done is
they could have done Scott V. Harris -- at low speed,
you've got four cars to his right, two of them occupied;
simply move into the car and hit it.  There were other
ways to stop --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, when I look at the
film, I thought well, sure, he's going back to the
highway.  You say we want to show that the policeman
knew he wasn't -- knew he wasn't.  I didn't see any
evidence showing that preferred or otherwise.  Though
what you said is there; it doesn't show he knew that the
guy wasn't going back to the car.
Your second question you raised, which I
think is a very good question, why didn't they shoot the
tires out?  And my answer to that is I don't know.  I
don't know.
I've heard the same thing that Chief Justice
has heard, and we've also seen the thing, and I -- of
course, it raises just the question you say.  But since
I don't know the answer, and since there's no evidence
in the answer, and since there are no cases dealing with
the answer, I begin to think I don't see how, you know,
you can say it was clearly established that they had to
shoot the tires out.  It's a question I don't know the
answer to.  What am I supposed to do?
MR. SMITH:  Well, it is clearly established
that the danger itself has to be the justification for
the deadly force.  That implies alternative --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's too general a rule,
and our cases hold that you cannot appeal to a very
general rule to say the law is clear.  You have to show
that the law as applied to these circumstances was
clear.  And there's nothing about shooting out tires
that I know of.
MR. SMITH:  Well, shooting out fires,
blocking, PIT maneuver as was discussed in Scott v.
Harris, police are trained in alternative methods.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there -- what is there
in the record?  When I saw the film, I saw your point.
You have a point.  But what I can't quite see is how it
was a clearly established one.  Maybe this is the case
where you ought to go, and if you're suing somebody else
and introduce a lot of evidence that shows that they
should shoot the tires out; and then there could be a
decision on that.  It comes up every so often.  But am I
right in thinking so far, there just hasn't been a case
on it?  There hasn't been an effort to do that.  There
hasn't -- so I'm left in this uncertainty, which
unfortunately for you means it wasn't clearly
established.
MR. SMITH:  Well, the issue still -- the
threshold issue is the choice of using deadly force
based on the danger.  In the first sequence, the danger
is not established with that officer because he is
standing beside that car.  And remember this:  Before
Officer Plumhoff gets to that car, Officer Evans is
already there.  He didn't see the danger.  He's got his
gun pulled; he has hit it against the windshield; and he
didn't see the need to shoot and he had an opportunity
before Officer Plumhoff did, and he never shot.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let's say there's
only one police officer chasing this fellow.  The same
thing happens.  You know, he turns off the interstate
after the 100-mile-an-hour chase on the highway and
stops; the officer gets out of the car; he starts taking
away again.  Would it be appropriate for that officer to
apply lethal force to prevent the vehicle from resuming
the high-speed chase?
MR. SMITH:  It is going to depend, as this
Court has said and other courts have said many times, on
the factual context at that time and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I've given you all
the facts.  I've given you all the pertinent facts.  Is
it appropriate for that officer to apply lethal force?
MR. SMITH:  The one fact that we haven't
talked about is where he is at the time.  Are we on an
isolated country road?  Are we at a dead end where he's
got him surrounded?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We're at the --
let's start with the same place that he was at in this
case.
MR. SMITH:  And -- and the scenario is, as I
understand it, we've had the same chase --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Everything is the
same except there's one police officer and he goes off
the interstate at that point; the same thing happens,
but there's only one.  And either -- the officer gets
out of the car and at that point, the fellow takes off
again resuming the chase, endangering the -- the public
by -- by doing so.  Is -- at that point, can the officer
apply lethal force?
MR. SMITH:  And since we've got two
sequences here, I'm assuming we're talking about the
second sequence, and the answer would clearly be no,
because --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not two sequences
whatever.  Just as I explained.  Both cars are stopped;
the officer gets out of the car; at that point, the
driver that led the chase takes off again.  That's all
the facts you need to know.
MR. SMITH:  In this case, the first three
shots occurred --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  Not this
case.  The case that I have hypothesized.
MR. SMITH:  But in the -- in the
hypothetical case, if you assume that he takes off, the
answer would still be no --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.
MR. SMITH:  -- because in order to shoot
him, you are shooting at a heavily populated residential
area, at oncoming traffic and you're endangering way
more people by the ballistics of 15 shots and the
potential for killing the driver who can do damage with
the vehicle.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there any
circumstance in which lethal force is appropriate once
the officer has stopped the car?
MR. SMITH:  Certainly.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, when?
MR. SMITH:  Well, if the person is armed.
If they've brandished a --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  Doesn't
know --
MR. SMITH:  If they drive straight at the
officer.  There's any number of circumstances where
clearly, lethal force would be appropriate.  No question
about that.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the situation is
that the officer has -- has this choice.  After a
high-speed chase, after attempting to persuade the
driver to get out of the car, the officer has one -- has
these choices:  Allow the chase to continue or use
lethal force.
MR. SMITH:  It's going --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Your answer is they have to
let the -- they -- they can use lethal force?  They have
to allow the chase to continue?  What?  Which?
MR. SMITH:  Depends on the context of the
circumstances and whether the danger is sufficient to
justify the use of deadly force.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The danger is he is going
to be going 100 miles an hour, okay, that the chase up
to now has been the way your client's chase was, in
which he endangered a lot of other people, forced cars
off the road, and so forth.  That's -- that's the --
that's the hypothetical.  Okay.  That person is about to
drive away and continue that kind of public-endangering
behavior.  Can the policeman shoot or not.
MR. SMITH:  You could not as he is driving
away because now you're endangering -- you're actually
endangering the people that you say you're trying to
protect.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no.  There's nobody
around, just -- just him.
MR. SMITH:  If there is nobody around --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There is nobody around.
Can -- can they shoot at him to stop him from
endangering the public again?
MR. SMITH:  Under Scott v. Harris, I would
say that -- that -- that you could because in Scott they
had the road clear, blocked --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, we -- you
know --
MR. SMITH:  -- and they weren't going to
endanger anyone else.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're just not willing to
give answers.
But we've been discussing this as though
that's the question, what should the policeman do?  But
that's not the question.  The question is, was there
clearly established law that made it apparent that this
was improper police conduct?  That's the question.  Not
what is proper police conduct, but was there clearly
established law that this was not proper police conduct?
What's your best case for that?
MR. SMITH:  Smith v. Cupp, McKaslin v.
Wilkins, going back to Garner, and all of the case --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So some of --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you distinguish
Brosseau?
MR. SMITH:  In several ways.  In Brosseau,
which held, by the way --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is the single --
MR. SMITH:  And -- and -- and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is a single police
officer trying to stop a fleeing suspect whose only
activity was a reported fight in a residential
neighborhood.
MR. SMITH:  Yes.  And it's distinguishable
in several ways, and it emphasizes the need for an
imminent threat of harm to other people who were in the
path, which happened to be four people in two cars that
the officers placed there and other officers also in the
path of the egress.
Also that officer had tried alternate means.
She tried to get the keys.  She tried to arrest him.
She actually hit the guy with a gun before she shot --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that goes back --
MR. SMITH:  -- and there was no passenger.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That goes back to my
12-shot sequence, which I still have a problem with.
In answering Justice Alito's question, he
has already gone 100 miles an hour when he -- the car
moved away, even though that part of the street was
deserted.  Why would a reasonable officer not be
suspicious that more reckless driving is going to
occur --
MR. SMITH:  Well, he --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- to escape them when
they finally get back into their cars?
MR. SMITH:  It -- it may be more suspicious,
but the decision at that point is going to endanger the
life of the passenger, and those bullets did not
discriminate.  Those shots with the passenger in the car
have to be viewed in terms of the officer's judgment,
not Mr. Rickard being able to take advantage of the fact
that they occurred.
But when you see that video, those 12 shots
are fired, one, after he has been shot three times, but
also they were fired where the ballistic circumstance
could bring the bullets to civilians, residents.  That's
a heavily populated area and a heavily traveled street.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was she trying to get out
of the car when -- when he was trapped there and, you
know, surrounded by the police car?
MR. SMITH:  No indication of that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  She didn't try to get out
of the car.
I mean, for all the police knew, she --
he -- she was a -- a cohort of his.  He fled.  Why was
he fleeing, by the way?  He just didn't want to --
didn't want to get a ticket for the broken headlight?
MR. SMITH:  Yeah, there is no record about
that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No -- I thought that there
was some indication that he had drugs.
MR. SMITH:  There was contraband in the car.
There was contraband in the car.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  So that's probably
why he was fleeing.
MR. SMITH:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And she might have been a
cohort of that.  Do -- do -- are the police supposed to
know that?  She made no effort to get out of the car.
MR. SMITH:  I don't know that she had in the
four seconds' time to get out of the car before the
shooting began, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I'd think you'd think
pretty quick in a situation like that, where this guy
has been driving you on the highway at 100 miles an
hour, swerving into and away from police cars.  Boy, I
would get out of that car so fast.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what is the
legal significance of the number of shots?  Is -- is
this case any different because 15 shots were fired as
opposed to one or two?
MR. SMITH:  I think primarily only because
on that second sequence, you're shooting at the public
just as much as you're shooting at the driver of that
car.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I'm not clear how that
works either.  Suppose the police are very good shots,
it doesn't hit the public, it just hits the assailant.
Is it still unreasonable because it wasn't a public
place?  And does that mean that the fleeing felon is
much better off if he goes to a public place?
MR. SMITH:  I think all --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I don't understand
how -- how this bears on -- on the -- on the question of
whether or not -- as to the reasonableness as to the
driver.
MR. SMITH:  The cases that have sustained
qualified immunity have done so in part, and in many
cases large part, because of the propriety of the
decision based on the protection of innocent people.
But the converse of that has to be true as
well, that you can't make a judgment to shoot just to
stop someone fleeing when you may be endangering the
lives of the innocents who, in this case, could be
injured or killed, not only by the bullets, but also by
the car.
If you --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But even -- well,
again, what standing does the driver have to complain
about the threat to civilians who are in the area?
MR. SMITH:  It -- it -- the question is
different than that, Chief Justice Roberts.  The
question is, when the officers know that there is a,
quote, "innocent" or another person in the car, that
should affect their judgment.  That should be a factor
in the determination of whether or not to start pulling
that trigger.
It's not -- it's not that Mr. Rickard gets
the advantage of it.  It's that it should affect the
officer's judgment.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course it's a factor,
but is it a factor that your clients can take advantage
of?  That's the issue.
I mean, maybe you -- you can demote the
policeman who did that.  Maybe even a lawsuit by --
by -- by the colleague in the car would be successful.
But the issue is whether your client has any
reason to complain about that, your client who caused
the whole thing, who caused the shooting in the last
analysis.
MR. SMITH:  There is no question that
Mr. Rickard's conduct was unreasonable and he has
culpability, but the issue is not him taking advantage
of it.  But the threshold issue is should they have used
deadly force in that circumstance.  And that passenger
is there.  We can't take away the fact that that
passenger is there.  And it should have been a factor in
the reasonable officer's judgment about whether or not
to initiate deadly force.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you say clearly
establishes that?  You -- you say the passenger is
there.  What case tells a police officer when there is a
passenger no lethal weapon?
MR. SMITH:  There is no case that says
specifically if there is a passenger there don't use a
weapon.  But virtually every case talks about the -- the
impact of using lethal force to do it or not to do it
when relative to innocents, third parties.
It is just -- that is an obvious part of the
judgment that should be made, is that you don't endanger
those other than the suspect, and you don't shoot or use
deadly force on the suspect if it is going to endanger
others.
JUSTICE ALITO:  As to the number of shots,
even with all the shots that were fired, Mr. Rickard
still was able to drive away for a short distance.
MR. SMITH:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't that right?
MR. SMITH:  Correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So what does that do to the
argument that too many shots were fired?
MR. SMITH:  It's not so much that it was too
many.  It is that second phase of shots that are -- if
they do what they are intended to do, and by the way
they did, then you would have created a moving missile
by the car because you're going to have the dead driver
that can endanger other people, and you're shooting in
the direction of other people.  Both those factors
should have militated against the second phase of shots.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There are two ways
in which the public is endangered.  You're -- the point
you're making is that if the police are firing somebody
in the public might get hit fired by a bullet.  The
point the officers make, that if you allow him to escape
and -- and continue a high-speed chase, there are other
people, innocent people, who might get injured or killed
by the car.
Now, how were the officers supposed to
decide on the spot whether there is a greater danger
that people are going to get hit by a stray bullet or
there is a greater danger that people are going to get
hit by the car?
MR. SMITH:  Or, Chief Justice Roberts, a
greater danger by a car driving down the road with a
dead driver behind the wheel, totally out of control,
and that almost happened in this case, as you see in the
video.  There was an oncoming car just before he veered
off to the left and hit that house.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're saying
they can't apply lethal force because they may not be
successful in -- in killing the driver?
MR. SMITH:  Using it on a moving car in a
circumstance like that is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought the car
wasn't moving when the shots were first fired?
MR. SMITH:  On the second -- in the second
sequence, the car is moving.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  This -- this is a
new principle.  You think it is clearly established law,
clearly established law, that you cannot shoot to kill a
driver whose -- whose car is moving?  Is that it?
MR. SMITH:  If --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that the principle you
say is clearly established?
MR. SMITH:  If doing so --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  My goodness, they do it all
the time.  You watch the movies about bank robberies,
you know, it happens all the time.  Are these movies
unrealistic?  You cannot shoot to kill somebody in a
moving car.
MR. SMITH:  In a --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that is -- that is not
just your view.  It is, you say, clearly established
law.
MR. SMITH:  That was even referenced from --
in the Scott case.  A distinction between using the type
of force used in Scott, to ram the vehicle to take it
off the road versus shooting somebody --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's what Scott
holds, that you can --
MR. SMITH:  It doesn't hold that, but it
references that distinction in Vaughan v. Cox.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does hold it?
Sir, you are arguing that the law is clearly
established.  That's the case you have to make.  You
can't just get up here and say you shouldn't shoot at
somebody in a moving car to kill.  Maybe you shouldn't.
What is the clearly established law that -- that
policemen should have known?
MR. SMITH:  Vaughan v. Cox talks about not
shooting someone in a moving car and that is re --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Talks about it?
MR. SMITH:  And Scott.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Talks about it?
MR. SMITH:  And that's -- which brings up a
good point.  I mean, the -- the cases have uniformly
held that the officers are not held to the standard of
reading constitutional law, which invites the inquiry
well, how are they going to know what's clearly
established law?  That has to be from training; and in
this case, the policy and procedures, which are in the
Joint Appendix, which closely tracks Graham.  Closely
tracks Garner.  Closely tracks any number of other
cases, including from their own circuit, McCaslin, which
held that qualified immunity did not apply in a
situation where the officer felt they why justified in
shooting to avoid another escape.
And those are the policies and procedures
that are applicable of the state of knowledge of these
officers when we look at clearly established law and all
of those authorities which support the fact that
qualified immunity should not attach in this case under
these circumstances.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the statement
that there was a police manual that says once you
authorize to shoot, you can continue shooting until the
job is done?
MR. SMITH:  I don't quarrel with that except
to the extent, in this case, in that second sequence,
you're endangering other people other than the person
that you're trying to stop.  That's -- that's the
distinction.
Before my time is through, I do want to go
back to the jurisdictional question, because in the end
in this case, the interlocutory was taking nothing more
than a challenge to the evidentiary sufficiency, the
facts necessary to consider both prongs.  The
constitutional prong and the clearly established prong
are the same facts.  There is a blending, though the
consideration may have to be different.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What facts do you contest
and we'll just subtract them from the facts that we
consider.  Which facts do you contest?  That he was
driving 100 miles an hour, swerving on the road, swerved
towards police cars, almost cause another car to go --
that's -- you don't contest that.
MR. SMITH:  We challenge that the car was a
danger at the time the shooting stopped.  We challenge
that there is any danger --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not a fact.
That's -- that's a conclusion.  Whether the car was a --
was a danger is a legal conclusion, not a fact.  What
facts do you -- do you say are contested?
MR. SMITH:  If we talk first about the chase
part before the stop --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. SMITH:  -- then there is contested facts
about whether or not there were assaults because the
video does not confirm that, and the officer's own
testimony was --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  We'll assume no
assaults.  What else?
MR. SMITH:  Then when we get to the stop,
they say that he rammed the cars three times.  We
clearly contest that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.  We'll eliminate
the ramming.  What else?
MR. SMITH:  They -- they contend that
Officer Ellis was in danger and that that was a
justification for the shooting.  Officer Ellis --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's assume -- we'll
assume he was not in danger.  Okay.
MR. SMITH:  Officer -- we contest that
Officer --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But we -- we are still left
with a very dangerous man careening down the road, who
is surrounded by police cars and still tries to get away
to continue his careening.  You can eliminate all those
minor facts that you're contesting and it's still a very
dangerous situation.
MR. SMITH:  And he didn't?  He did not make
the move to get away until after he'd been shot three
times.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
Mr. Mosley, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MOSLEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MOSLEY:  Very briefly.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just to clarify one
thing, Mr. Mosley.  When were the three shots fired?
When he had moved backwards?
MR. MOSLEY:  The three shots were fired, if
you look at dash-cam Unit 286, at 12:17:42 is where the
strikes of the car begin and the the shot begins -- the
first shot of the three begins at 12:17:45, three
seconds after the first contact was made.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I don't know
that you answered my question.
MR. MOSLEY:  I'd like to.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We don't care about the
seconds.
MR. MOSLEY:  Okay.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Place it in the context.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.  I don't care about
the seconds.  I just asked the car -- I thought the
shots were fired after he had moved backwards away from
where the officers had initially stopped him.
MR. MOSLEY:  That's correct, Your Honor.
And then he moved backwards.  He was next to the
building.  He goes forward briefly three times.  You can
characterize it however you want to.  Unit 286 shows it
very clearly.  Then shots are fired after the beginning
of that and then he backs out and more shots are fired
as he backs out and drives away.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Got it.
MR. MOSLEY:  The Petitioners did raise in
their brief in support below that Officers Forthman,
Officers Ellis and Officers Evans did not use deadly
force.  We clearly raised it in our brief in support and
it was not addressed and it was not addressed at the
Sixth Circuit either, and it's fantastical to suggest
otherwise.
Cole v. Bone, Justice Breyer, does show that
shooting tires doesn't work.  It only creates more
dangerous -- a more dangerous situation.  In that case,
they did shoot out the tires, in the Eighth Circuit, and
the -- the vehicle kept careening on.  It can create
a -- a ricochet.  Now, that's not in the record, but
Cole v. Bone is certainly cited in our brief.
Otherwise, unless there's any further
questions --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Mosley, just out of
curiosity, does -- does this police department actually
have rules for what a police officer is supposed to do
when there's a fleeing vehicle?  Were they -- were they
acting in accordance or not in accordance with certain
rules that the police department had?
MR. MOSLEY:  Justice Kagan, at Volume II of
the -- the Joint Appendix, there are such rules.  I
submit to you that they were acting substantially in
compliance with those rules.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What were they?  I mean, I
don't know, and I --
MR. MOSLEY:  Well, they're fairly -- fairly
lengthy.  But there's very specific rules on engaging in
high-speed pursuits, very specific rules in using -- in
the use of deadly force.  And I submit that given the
rapidly-evolving circumstance in this case, these
officers did the best they could and were compliant with
those rules, although those rules do not set a
constitutional standard.  This Court does.
If there's no further questions, I'd like to
rest.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Counsel, the case is submitted.
