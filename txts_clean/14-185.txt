CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
next in Case 14-185, Mata v. Lynch.
Mr. Fleming.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FLEMING:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Court has been offered two ways to
approach this case, a short way and a long way.  We
believe we prevail under both and I will address both,
but I would start with the short way, which we think is
the right way.  This is a case about appellate
jurisdiction --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You know the way to our
hearts.
(Laughter.)
MR. FLEMING:  I try to please, Justice
Kennedy.
This is a case about appellate jurisdiction
and specifically whether Congress has given the courts
of appeals jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion
to reopen that would be timely through the application
of equitable tolling.  And that question is answered by
Section 1252 of the INA, which creates jurisdiction over
denials of motion to reopen as the Court confirmed in
Kucana and it makes no distinction based on the grounds
of the denial of the motion to reopen.
In this case the board denied Mr. Mata's
motion as untimely, it ruled that equitable tolling was
generally available, but that Mr. Mata was not entitled
to it because it erroneously believed that his
misdemeanor assault conviction qualified as a crime
involving moral turpitude.  That legal error was
reviewable.  It would have been reviewed in any other
circuit.  It should have been reviewed here and the
government agrees, and Mr. Peterson as amicus, does not
mount any argument that that denial somehow does not
fall within the jurisdictional grant of Section 1252.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you explain why -- on
the surface, he beats up his girlfriend.  But why that
is not a crime involving moral turpitude?  Because I had
thought that the -- the rest of this is academic if the
bottom line is he's committed a crime of moral
turpitude?
MR. FLEMING:  Justice Ginsburg, first of
all, that -- that is a question that the First Circuit
did not reach and we submit should have reached.  But to
answer the question, the BIA has a very developed
jurisprudence regarding when assault crimes qualify as
crimes involving moral turpitude and it involves
consideration of a number of factors.
It involves not only the level of injury
that was either intended or caused, but also the level
of intent.  And as the level of intent that is
chargeable under the offense decreases from
intentionality to, say, recklessness, then the level of
bodily injury that is required has to concomitantly
increase in order for it to constitute moral turpitude.
In Texas, the simple assault statute that
Mr. Mata pled guilty under is not an aggravated assault
statute.  It can be charged based only on bodily injury
and that is defined in a purposely broad way, as the
Texas court of appeals has stated, to include even
injury caused by relatively minor physical contact.
So simple assault that can be charged under
that provision is not turpitudeness and that's what the
Board should have ruled and that was the argument that
was presented to the Fifth Circuit, but the Fifth
Circuit determined that it did not have jurisdiction to
decide. That is the issue we've asked this Court to
review.  Of course, it does not need to go into the
turpitudeness or not quality of the offense under
Section 2201(a)(1)of the Texas Penal Code.
Because this is a jurisdictional question,
there is no need to go further to the issues that Mr.
Peterson is raising regarding whether there is equitable
tolling as a matter of merits under the INA.  We don't
think it's necessary.  We think the Fifth Circuit can
address that if appropriate, if it chooses to on remand.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What if --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wouldn't the Fifth
Circuit need to be -- I mean, the Fifth Circuit view was
no equitable tolling, period.  The statute says 90 days.
It has a couple of exceptions and that's it.  So if we
simply say you have jurisdiction, the -- the answer
would likely be fine, you told us we have jurisdiction.
We think this limitation period has no give, end of
case.
MR. FLEMING:  Justice Ginsburg, we don't
think that's what the Fifth Circuit did in this case or
in any other.  In this case, the Court specifically
disavowed any ruling on the merits of the equitable
tolling claim.  It simply dismissed the petition for
lack of jurisdiction.  Notably, the BIA in 2012 in a
case called Chavez-Guzman, which we cite in our reply,
recognized that the Fifth Circuit has not addressed in a
published decision whether the motion time limitations
may be equitably tolled in cases claiming
ineffectiveness of counsel.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why did -- why did the
Fifth Circuit treat this, therefore, as a -- as it
requested review the sua sponte extension granted below?
MR. FLEMING:  It's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why would it have
done that if it -- if it thought that, in fact, there
was some argument about whether -- whether they could
appeal the denial of extension in law as opposed to in
the sua sponte discretion of the agency?
MR. FLEMING:  It's -- there are two stages
to the answer, Justice Scalia.  And it's regrettable
that the decisions that issue from the Fifth Circuit do
not -- they have conclusory statements in them and not a
lot of reasoning.
First of all, you have the unpublished
decisions which say that the circuit will construe a
request for equitable tolling as a request for sua
sponte reopening.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?  Why would one do
that?
MR. FLEMING:  So my best reading of them --
and again, the reasoning is sparse.  They say that in
their view, equitable tolling is not a basis for filing
a motion after 90 days.  Now, because they have not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which means there --
there's no equitable tolling.
MR. FLEMING:  I -- I -- now, that's not
something that they've ever adopted in a published
decision.  I think one reading of that -- and this is
the reading the government, I think, endorses or at the
very least there's a dispute about it -- is that the
Fifth Circuit was saying the statue and the regulations
on their terms do not use the words "equitable tolling."
That, of course, does not resolve the fundamental
question whether as a matter of statutory
interpretation --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure.
MR. FLEMING:  -- or as a matter of
administrative authority equitable tolling can be
applied.
But I -- I want to be clear, we -- we do not
fear this question at all.  And if the Court wishes to
reach the merits issues that Mr. Peterson has put before
the Court, we are happy to fight on that ground.  We
simply want it to be plain that we didn't present the --
the jurisdictional question as including a merits
question.  If the Court thinks it needs to be decided,
then the Court has the briefing and I'm prepared to talk
about it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you acknowledge that
if -- if you view this as the Fifth Circuit viewed it,
as a request to review the sua sponte extension granted
by the agency, that the Fifth Circuit would have had no
jurisdiction over that?
MR. FLEMING:  We do not, Justice Scalia.
And I just want to be clear the context in which I
answer that question.  That requires a lot of steps
before the Court even gets to that.  First of all, it
not only requires getting to the merits issues, it
requires rejecting our primary -- our contention on the
merits, which is that as a matter of statutory
interpretation, this is tollable.  It requires rejecting
the government's position that at the very least, the
statute does not prohibit the board from implementing
the 90-day time limit by using equitable tolling.  And
if you get to that point such that you're in a
through-the-looking-glass world where the board was, in
fact, not doing what it thought it was doing, namely,
exercising authority under the statute, but instead,
exercising regulatory sua sponte authority, then you get
to the question, are there judicially manageable
standards to review what the board, in fact, did in this
case?
And there clearly are.  They have -- they're
being reviewed in every other circuit when there is a
request for equitable tolling based on ineffective
assistance of counsel.  The equitable tolling standards
are well settled under this Court's decision in Pace v.
DiGuglielmo.  The ineffective assistance standards are
well settled by the board's own Lozada decision.
Now, it may well be that there are other
situations where the board simply says request denied
and that may be a situation where jurisdiction would be
in doubt.  But if you are talking about a case like this
one where the board writes an opinion that says, here
are the standards we are applying and we believe that
the Petitioner is ineligible for equitable tolling
because his conviction is for a crime involving moral
turpitude, that is a legal question that is reviewable,
regardless of how you caption the authority under which
the board is acting.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, I've -- I've
forgotten, but is there a circuit split on that third --
on the sua sponte review?
MR. FLEMING:  There is no circuit split as
such because every other circuit believes, as we think
is correct, that this kind of decision is reviewable as
a matter of statutory authority.  And that's what the
board is doing.  That's what the board itself thinks
it's doing.  So every other circuit to have decided the
issue does say it has jurisdiction to review this kind
of decision.  They don't call it sua sponte.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do we make it clear
to the Fifth Circuit?  We say Fifth Circuit, you have
jurisdiction.  They say fine.  We said before and we say
again that this statute is not susceptible to equitable
tolling and then we're right back where we are.
MR. FLEMING:  If that is, in fact, what the
Fifth Circuit does, then it may well be, because then
there would be a clear circuit split on the merits
question of the availability of equitable tolling.  I
would hold out hope that the Fifth Circuit would not
create that circuit split; that when disabused of the
belief that it lacks jurisdiction, it would then engage
in the analysis that we and the government believe it
should engage in and find that like every other circuit
to have addressed the issue, there is, in fact,
equitable tolling available and would address Mr. Mata's
request for it on the merits.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it knew at the time
it rendered its decision that the other circuits were
taking a different position on whether the 90-day period
was susceptible to extension.
MR. FLEMING:  It did, Your Honor.  The panel
felt -- felt itself bound by prior precedent on the
jurisdictional question.  This is why I don't think
fundamentally that it reached a decision in this case or
in any published opinion on the merits of that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure -- did the
First Circuit say it has no jurisdiction to review
the -- the statutory question?
MR. FLEMING:  The --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought all it did was,
since there is no tolling under the statute, we're going
to interpret this as a sua sponte thing, and the only
question before them is whether that sua sponte thing
conferred jurisdiction or not.  Isn't that what
happened?
MR. FLEMING:  It -- I -- I don't think so,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
MR. FLEMING:  I think if that had happened,
if that was really what the Fifth Circuit meant to do,
then it should have assumed jurisdiction over our
request for statutory tolling.  It should have denied
the petition to that extent, and then it could have
dismissed the request for sua sponte reopening.  But it
didn't do that.  It dismissed the entire thing for lack
of jurisdiction, which is why we think there is no
merits ruling here that the Court needs to reach.
Again, however, I say that if the Court
wishes to reach it, we believe the answer is clear and
correct under this Court's precedence that the 90-day
time limit is a statute of limitations, and that it
should be -- there is no reason to think that the
presumption of tolling either doesn't apply or has been
rebutted.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where -- where is
Mr. Mata at this point?
MR. FLEMING:  He's -- he's at home with his
family.  His -- his order has been --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you don't mind if
this goes back to the Fifth Circuit.
MR. FLEMING:  This should go back to the
Fifth Circuit, and the question is simply that Mr.
Peterson has raised is, what does it go back with?  Does
it go back solely with directions that the court has
jurisdiction and everything else should be addressed by
the -- the Fifth Circuit in the first instance, or does
it go back with a decision that, in addition to there
being jurisdiction, there is also equitable tolling, and
then the Fifth Circuit can address the question on the
merits.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MR. FLEMING:  With the Court's permission,
I'll reserve the balance of my time.  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Yang.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL AND REMAND
MR. YANG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The court of appeals here rested its
decision on a basic and fundamental error of
administrative law.  Rather than review the board's
decision on its own terms, the court of appeals
recharacterized the question before it into a different
question over which it lacked jurisdiction.  That course
is inconsistent with the Chenery rule, which, since even
before the APA, required that judicial review of agency
action be based on the rationale adopted by the agency.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the way you put it
causes me to believe that you agreed that the Fifth
Circuit would have had no jurisdiction.
MR. YANG:  We --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If indeed it was the sua
sponte action that they were reviewing.
MR. YANG:  That's right.  We disagree with
Petitioner on this point --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  On that point.
MR. YANG:  But we don't think it affects the
disposition here.  Also I would note that every single
court of appeals with jurisdiction over immigration
cases agrees with our position.  There is no circuit
split because it's unanimous in our favor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And Mr. Yang, could you
point me to the place in the board's decision that you
think makes clear what the board was doing?  Because as
I looked at the board's decision, honestly, I found it a
little bit difficult to tell whether the board was
denying it on statutory grounds or on sua sponte
grounds.
MR. YANG:  I agree with you that the board's
decision could be a little bit more clear.  Some
background is helpful.
This is a question of equitable tolling for
ineffective assistance of counsel.  That's the claim.
And so that claim embodies at least four requirements.
One, you have to have normal equitable tolling
satisfied.
You have to also show ineffective
assistance, and that has subparts, including prejudice
from the ineffective assistance, and you have to show
that you've met the requirements of the Lozada decision,
which has certain procedural showings that have to be
made.
Now, in order to get to equitable tolling,
you therefore have to show prejudice.  And if you look
at Petition Appendix 7, after talking about Lozada in
the first full paragraph, in the second paragraph, they
say, you know, in Lozada, although the resulting
summary -- there was a summary dismissal of appeal, did
not amount to a deprivation of due process and was not
prejudicial.
And then with respect to prejudice, they
explain on two bases, the decision here, or the alleged
ineffective assistance was not prejudicial, one, because
it was not a crime of -- there was a crime of moral
turpitude which precluded relief; and, two, the alien
failed to submit at the motion to reopen stage, evidence
showing that there was exceptional and extremely unusual
hardship.
All of that goes to prejudice, which goes to
the tolling question.  And the predicate, of course, was
the statement earlier that the time for filing a motion
to reopen may be tolled in cases of ineffective
assistance of counsel, but then they were just focusing
on the second.
So the way that we read the board, which I
think is the way the board has decided these cases
generally is that the questions of ineffective
assistance and equitable tolling here are kind of mixed.
And the board's decision addressed the -- the prejudice
prong of that -- those requirements.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I somehow have the
impression, I don't know, the AG is going to have some
kind of rulemaking relevant to this.
MR. YANG:  There is pending rulemaking, as
we noted in our brief.  There is a notice of proposed
rulemaking that the Department has submitted to OMD that
is expected to, you know, hopefully go forward.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Rulemaking has to do with
the existence or nonexistence of equitable tolling under
this provision?
MR. YANG:  The rulemaking, of course, is not
public, but what I can tell you --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. YANG:  -- is that the -- in the Compean
decision, the Attorney General addressed generally
questions of ineffective assistance of counsel.  One of
the components of that was equitable tolling of the
deadline for ineffective assistance.  It would be
logical to assume that because the -- that Compean
ruling was vacated in favor of the rulemaking, the
rulemaking scope could be similar to the Attorney
General's decision.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So on that assumption, that
would, as I understand it, give the Fifth Circuit
something new to think about in -- in addressing this
question; is that right?
MR. YANG:  It certainly would, and it would
also have the benefit, on remand, of the government's
clear view that there is equitable tolling here,
although not applicable to this alien, but just
generally equitable tolling is available as all the
courts of appeals have decided.  And as we note in our
brief, we don't think the Fifth Circuit is precluded
even at the panel level from reaching that decision.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would the -- would the
Fifth Circuit, with this rulemaking, you can't tell us
what it is at this stage, this early stage, would it be
available, will they have a rule should we remand this
case to the Fifth Circuit?
MR. YANG:  I think it's unlikely there's
going to be a final rule by the time this Court's
decision is issued.  The unified agenda projects a
notice of proposed rulemaking being issued late this
year.  And then the notice and comment period would have
to elapse, and we'd have to get to a final rule.  So I
don't think by the time June rolls around, we'll get the
final rule.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm -- I'm sorry, but there
would be an NPR when?  Late this calendar year?
MR. YANG:  Late this calendar year.  That's
what the unified agenda projects.
So -- but again, I don't think sending this
case back on the very basic point that the Fifth Circuit
can't sidestep its obligation to review a motion to
reopen by characterizing it as something that it's not,
would wipe the slate clean.  The Fifth Circuit in its
first -- in an earlier unpublished decision, in fact,
found that there was equitable tolling and reversed the
board to apply equitable tolling.  Only later did it
change course without any reasoning and assert, again
with zero reasoning, that there was not equitable
tolling, and then adopted this construal rule.
But the construal rule itself is just
fundamentally into the teeth of the Chenery doctrine.
And had the court of appeals recognized that what it had
to review was the denial of the alien's motion to
reopen, it would have had jurisdiction.  And it doesn't
matter, you know, amicus has tried to -- I think
artfully tried to recharacterize this jurisdictional
question into a question of the merits, but the answer
to the merits doesn't affect the jurisdiction.
If you were to assume, as the amicus has
argued, that there is no equitable tolling in this
context because the statute precludes it, that would not
be a jurisdictional problem.  What it would mean is that
the court of appeals would simply affirm the board on
the merits; that is affirm the board's denial of a
motion to reopen, because there can be no equitable
tolling.
Again, we come back to the -- this case is a
very simple case.  It's an appropriate case to end the
term on; it's quick, it's easy.  The court of appeals
should have simply done what courts of appeals do all
the time when they're conducting agency review, a review
of agency action; that is, review the action before it
and not recharacterize it into something that it's not.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, to be fair to
the Fifth Circuit, I mean, I can't put myself in their
mind, but I think they may well have been trying to give
Mr. Mata the benefit of the doubt or give him every
chance.  I mean, they say it's equitable tolling but,
you know, you're not going to get equitable tolling, so
that's no relief.  And since you can't get it, maybe
you're trying to get something else.  And so we'll look
at whether you get something else, and then too bad, it
turns out you don't get that either.
MR. YANG:  Well, I won't speculate what
to -- what the court of appeals' motivations might have
been for its ruling, but the ruling itself is again just
fundamentally into the teeth of Chenery.  It's true that
whencourts are addressing a pleading that's filed
before the court, itself, the court can say, well, I'm
going to read this generously.  They do this in certain
contexts.
But when you're conducting review of agency
action, the rule that has always existed in the modern
APA era has been you look to what the agency has done.
And when you look to what the agency has done here, it
addressed and rejected the alien's motion to reopen.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just to try to be a little
bit generous to the Fifth Circuit, again, I mean, I
started off by saying, I found it a little bit hard to
tell what the agency was doing.  And you presented a
very good explanation, but it's an explanation that
actually requires some background knowledge, and I'm not
sure that they would have gotten that from just looking
at the face of the thing.
MR. YANG:  And I don't mean to -- to fault
the Fifth Circuit.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, I mean, you can't
really -- Chenery can't really operate very well if you
can't figure it out.
MR. YANG:  Well, that's true.  But the --
that is true, but the answer then is always to remand.
If you can't discern what the -- the course of the
agency's decision is, the other established rule is you
remand. And, you know, the -- this is not an unfamiliar
question to the courts.  Generally, if you can discern,
even if it's in a cryptic way, what -- what the -- the
alien's -- excuse me -- the agency's path in an agency
decision, you review that.  If you --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it true that the --
the -- the agency, the BIA, has, a number of times,
recognized the existence of equitable tolling of this
90-day period, but has never done so in a
precedential opinion?
MR. YANG:  That -- that is correct.  That is
correct.  It -- there is no precedential opinion.  There
was, of course, the Attorney General's opinion in
Compean, which addressed both the standards for
ineffective assistance claims, as well as the
application of equitable tolling for cases involving
ineffective assistance.  So the AG made that ruling, and
it's a way that's consistent with, I think, the -- what
we've articulated in the brief.  That was vacated in
lieu of what -- what we will now have, which is a
rulemaking process to address the questions.  So there
is no precedent, although the Attorney General has
briefly spoken on the issue.
If there's no further questions, I'm going
to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MR. YANG:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Peterson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. PETERSON
ON BEHALF OF THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE JUDGMENT BELOW
MR. PETERSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
We agree with the government that orders
denying statutory motions to reopen are reviewable in
the courts of appeals, and we agree with the government
that orders of the board denying invitations for the
board to reopen sua sponte are not reviewable in the
courts of appeals because they're committed to agency
discretion by law.
Where we part ways with the government is on
how you distinguish between the two of them.  And we
offer what we think is the easiest test, which is the
timeliness.  If an alien asks the board to reopen within
the statutory deadline, within the 90 days, he has a
right to reopening that is reviewable under Kucana if
the board denies it.
On the other hand, if the alien requests
reopening after the expiration of the 90-day statutory
period, the board is not obligated to grant reopening in
those circumstances.  The board could grant reopening
only through its exercise of its sua sponte authority,
and as a result, that decision is wholly in the board's
discretion.
Now, the government turns to Chenery to
suggest a rule that courts must always characterize
agency decisions in precisely the way the agencies did.
This Court, we think, rejected that argument in
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers where it explained
that Chenery has nothing whatever to do with whether
agency action is reviewable.  So we see Brotherhood as a
remarkably analogous case.  There the request being made
of the commission was to reconsider a previous decision,
and the court distinguished between two types of ways
that a party could ask the commission to change one of
its earlier decisions.
It could file a motion for reconsideration,
simply suggesting that the law was wrong, the earlier
decision was simply incorrect on the same record.  The
court held that that is not reviewable.  Or the party
could file a motion to reopen with new evidence
attached, which would be reviewable.  And what the court
said was that in determining whether the court of
appeals had jurisdiction over the petition for review,
it didn't need to focus on how the agency characterized
its order.  It could focus on whether that order was
reviewable.
So in this case, Petitioner acknowledges
that if equitable tolling is unavailable, his motion to
reopen was untimely.  If he filed 115 days, his only
argument in favor of timeliness is equitable tolling.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I'm -- I'm a
little concerned because we do have to, on some levels,
address the question of whether a sua -- sua sponte
decision not to -- not to reopen is -- is reviewable.
I -- I think as a general matter, one could say that
given the vast discretion that the BIA gets in denying,
that one should basically defer to their decisions in
sua sponte reopenings.  But occasionally, they do it not
as an exercise of discretion, but as an erroneous
interpretation of law.  And there's plenty of standards
to correcting that.  And so even for me, in sua sponte
openings -- and I do understand I'm probably on a losing
slope -- and I think that's what the -- the board is
basically saying.  It's a matter of -- of deciding
whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel, and
we have a right and this is the standard we're going to
set.  Lozada sets the standard that we're going to look
at, and for that reason, there is equitable tolling.
That's basically all they're saying, in my judgment.
MR. PETERSON:  Your Honor, we disagree that
Lozada sets the standard for ineffective assistance of
counsel.  We believe that Lozada sets the standard for
how an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be
raised.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're right.  How it --
but here, they basically said it -- you didn't have due
diligence, I believe, and so you failed the
prerequisites.
MR. PETERSON:  Your Honor, we would disagree
that in this case, the board actually construed
Petitioner as asking for equitable tolling.  And there's
a reason for that, which is that Petitioner did not ask
for equitable tolling before the Board of Immigration
Appeals.  His initial motion to reopen does not
acknowledge its untimeliness.  It says nothing about
untimeliness at all.  He mentions, in his reply in
support of the  motion to reopen, that it is not
untimely if there are exceptional circumstances.  You
will not find the phrase "equitable tolling" in any of
the papers the Petitioner filed with the Board of
Immigration --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, who was he --
MR. PETERSON:  -- Appeals.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- represented by at that
stage?  I mean, is -- this is a case involving
ineffective assistance of counsel when he brought the --
at -- at what stage was there competent counsel?
MR. PETERSON:  Justice Ginsburg, my
understanding is that  Petitioner's current theory is that
he was represented by competent counsel when he retained
new counsel after the board's initial denial of his
appeal.  That was October 10th, 19 days after the
board's decision.  You'll see --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What we have here is a
question that we agreed to review.  The question is
whether the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in this
case in holding it has no jurisdiction to review
Petitioner's request that the board equitably tolled the
90-day deadline on his motion to reopen as a result of
ineffective assistance of counsel.  We granted review on
that.
As far as what the Fifth Circuit said, among
other things it says, it lacks jurisdiction to review
the BIA's denial of Mata's untimely motion to reopen,
and so it need not address the merits.  Now, it said
other things, too, which tend to support you as going on
this other ground, but it did say that.  And you read,
at least somewhat possibly, you could say he did ask the
board to equitably toll his motion.  And the board said,
no, we won't equitably do that because it's not going to
make any difference, basically.  You weren't really
prejudiced.
Okay.  Given all that, why should we decide
a different question?  Why don't we decide the question
that we said we would decide?  And if we're going to
decide the question we said we'd decide, I would think
the answer is pretty clear.  They did have jurisdiction
to review it.  They can review it and say the board was
right because they have a lot of discretion here,
et cetera, or for whatever reason, because there is no
equitable tolling, whatever they want to say.  I
wouldn't guess that.
But I've never heard of any precedent that
would -- I can't think of one that would suggest that
when an agency does something like this, requests
equitably to toll, denied, appeal, that a court of
appeals wouldn't consider whether they're right or
wrong.  I mean, what -- what -- if we get to that
question, is there any case?  No, because I thought
normally, courts of appeals do review that kind of
question.  You may have a weak argument, but then
they'll review it.  They'll say no.
MR. PETERSON:  Justice Breyer, as we
understand what the Fifth Circuit did here, the Fifth
Circuit has already established in its jurisprudence
that equitable tolling is unavailable for statutory
motions.
I know Petitioner now takes a different
view.  I point you to Petitioner's arguments before the
court of appeals in his reply brief on page 8 where he
asked the court of appeals to reexamine its holding in
Ramos-Bonilla that motions to reopen are not subject to
equitable tolling.  So at least before the court of
appeals, Petitioner saw the Fifth Circuit's
jurisprudence the same way that we did.
Now, because, in the Fifth Circuit,
equitable tolling of the 90-day deadline is unavailable,
the Board of Immigration Appeals could have granted
relief only by exercising its sua sponte authority to
reopen.  That is the only basis on which the Board of
Immigration Appeals could have reopened in this case.
Therefore, the Board of Immigration Appeals' decision
whether or not to reopen is a decision that is committed
to agency discretion by law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but normally
it's a -- a circuit precedent establishing a particular
rule on the merits doesn't operate as a bar to
jurisdiction.  I mean -- I mean, they may give you a
very short order citing the decision that controls the
precedent in the particular case, but they certainly
have jurisdiction in reviewing.
For example, I mean, let's suppose you've
got an argument that you want to overturn the precedent.
They would have had jurisdiction to do that.
MR. PETERSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, we think
the difference here is that the deadline isn't simply a
question of whether the board was right or wrong in
denying the statutory motion.  We see the timeliness as
the key distinction between whether the board's
discretion was unfettered on reopening or fettered on
reopening.  And so the first question as we see it --
that is how we distinguish orders denying statutory
motions to reopen from orders denying motions to reopen
sua sponte.
And so the first question we would say that
a court of appeals would need to address is whether the
alien's motion to reopen before the Board of Immigration
Appeals was timely.
If that motion was untimely, then it rested
solely in the board's discretion whether to grant or
deny reopening.  And for that reason, under Heckler v.
Chaney, under Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, the
Fifth Circuit properly dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you deny that the
plaintiff here -- that Petitioner thought that he was
asking for equitable tolling?  Because I guess -- I
guess this is very similar to the Chief Justice's
question, but it seems to me if somebody comes in and he
says, I'm entitled to equitable tolling, and the court
thinks, no, you're not, equitable tolling is
unavailable.  Then what the court should do is something
like this.  It should first say, sorry, equitable
tolling is not available.
Now, is there a different way we can
construe your petition?  Oh, maybe there is.  We can
construe it as a sua sponte decision.  Now in the end
that's going to lead you to the same results because we
don't have jurisdiction over that, but that that's the
proper order of things.  You know, first we'll say, oop,
sorry you lose equitable tolling is unavailable, and
then we'll do whatever construing we can do to see if
there are any alternative avenues, and then we decide
there are not.
MR. PETERSON:  Well, Justice Kagan we
believe that's what the Fifth Circuit did, albeit
implicitly.  I point to page 3 of the Petition Appendix:
We lacked jurisdiction to review the BIA's denial of
Mata's untimely motion to reopen.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but there's a -- there
is something, and this is what the Chief Justice was
saying, too.  There is something that the court does
have jurisdiction over and it's the question of whether
equitable tolling was available.  That's a merits
question, I have jurisdiction over whether equitable
tolling is available.  I say it's not or I say it is;
doesn't matter, I have jurisdiction over that question
either way.
MR. PETERSON:  The court of appeals
certainly always has jurisdiction to determine whether
it has jurisdiction.  So on the way to a jurisdictional
ruling --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's not determining whether
it has jurisdiction.  That -- whether equitable tolling
is available or is unavailable is -- is not itself a
jurisdictional question.  That's a merits question.
And then when you decide that it's
unavailable you can say, okay, is there another way to
construe the thing, and that ends -- that lands you in a
jurisdictional question as to whether you have
jurisdiction over sua sponte decisions.
MR. PETERSON:  Justice Kagan, as we've tried
to suggest it, the timeliness is related to the
jurisdiction, because the timeliness of the motion to
reopen tells you whether the board's order denying
reopening is an order that was solely in the board's
discretion or not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well  it's really --
you're taking a merits first.  You decide the merits and
then we say, then there's no jurisdiction.  This is --
this is what -- whatever the rule is -- as you recognize,
is a claim-processing rule.  You -- that rule needs to be
interpreted whether it has any give.
But it's -- it's -- there's jurisdiction to
decide that question.  I think you agree that there is
jurisdiction in the Fifth Circuit to decide whether or
not this 90-day limit can be equitably tolled.
MR. PETERSON:  Your Honor, yes, Justice
Ginsburg, we do agree the Fifth Circuit can decide
that -- has decided it, and as a result of deciding
that, did properly reach the judgement it reached in
this case.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you see there's a little
bit of a problem with the way the Fifth Circuit is going
about this thing, because what the Fifth Circuit has
done is to say that equitable tolling is unavailable and
the only time it ever uttered those words is in an
unpublished opinion.  And in all the published opinions
it's just said, you know, we're construing this as
something else and we have no jurisdiction over that.
And what that effectively has done is to insulate from
our review the determination that the Fifth Circuit has
made, if the Fifth Circuit has made it, that equitable
tolling is unavailable.
MR. PETERSON:  Justice Scalia, when
Ramos-Bonilla adopted the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  He's definitely Justice
Scalia.
(Laughter.)
MR. PETERSON:  I'm very sorry --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And we're not often
confused.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a good question,
though.
(Laughter.)
MR. PETERSON:  Thank you.  When the Fifth
Circuit in Ramos-Bonilla adopted the second half of --
adopted the construal rule from Lin v. Mukasey, we think
the Fifth Circuit necessarily adopted the premise for
that construal rule as well.
So when the Fifth Circuit quotes Lin v.
Mukasey for the proposition that an argument seeking
equitable tolling is in essence an argument that the BIA
should have exercised its discretion to reopen sua
sponte, we think that Ramos-Bonilla necessarily adopted
Lin's premise of that, that equitable tolling is not a
basis for filing an untimely or numerically barred
motion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wouldn't the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But the problem that I
actually have, I guess, at your reaction, is if we don't
follow what I think is the fairly simple thing of the
question presented, you announce two things that I think
there's a huge argument about.
One is whether there is court review of the
sua sponte thing because, as you probably know, there
has been a long argument for 40 years about the meaning
of that first part of the APA in Davis; or somebody
says, well, when they say there's no court review when
you commit a matter of discretion to the agency by law,
of course there isn't.  They're acting lawfully.  But
you can still get review of whether they acted as an
abuse of that discretion.  Of course.  And I think you
can.
on that.
question?
But I understand there are different points
Do we really want to open up that big
And as far as the other question you want us
to open up about whether this is statutorily
forbidden -- you say whether -- whether equitable
tolling is forbidden here, again there are two views.
Lots of the circuits think, no, it isn't, and moreover
the SG thinks that, moreover they're having a rulemaking
on that in a year or so that could encompass that, but
it's secret.  But nonetheless -- nonetheless it might.
And -- and so we're getting into what's
actually I think a tough question.  And maybe it's
cowardly.  But I'm thinking why go into those two tough
questions, when in fact we asked for the answer to a
simple question.  There are -- you have written a very
good brief and I understand what you're doing and -- but
I still am sort of stuck on this, which I'll put to you.
MR. PETERSON:  Well, thank you, Justice
Breyer.  I know it's the end of the term and I'm asking
you to complicate the case --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. PETERSON:  But let me point out though
that the Solicitor General might agree that equitable
tolling is available, but agrees with us that every
court of appeals other than the Fifth Circuit to have
addressed the availability of equitable tolling has
gotten its analysis wrong.  The Solicitor General agrees
with us that the presumption of equitable tolling is
inapplicable to these sorts of statutes.
Every court of appeals to have reached this,
as Petitioner does, reaches the result that equitable
tolling is available through the presumption of
equitable tolling.  And now the Solicitor General
suggests that the administrative rulemaking might
provide a solution to this.  Well, in at least two
circuits, and likely more, that's been foreclosed.  If
you look at the Second Circuit's decision in Iavorski,
the Ninth Circuit's decision in Soca-Gonzalez, both of
them note that Board of Immigrations Appeals' position
is that equitable tolling is unavailable.  Both of them
conclude that the statute unambiguously requires
equitable tolling and reject deference to the agency.
So to the extent that you have
administrative rulemaking here, as best I can
understand, the Fifth Circuit is the only circuit that
would actually be able to even potentially give effect
to it.  And --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I'm totally
confused.  I -- I think what the agency is saying, at
least in this situation, is there is no explicit command
in the statute about equitable tolling.  There is a time
limit in the statute.  But can it be tolled or not?
There's no explicit command in the statute it can't.
And so as a matter of procedure, which
generally we give a huge amount of deference to the
agency, it has, albeit in unpublished opinions, followed
a practice of considering it in motions to reopen.  And
from that practice, they're telling us, there is,
because the agency has determined that, with respect to
IAC claims, that they will do it.
I don't actually see that much problem with
the problem, but I do agree with Justice Breyer that we
don't need to get to that question here, because we
really don't know whether that's the view of the Fifth
Circuit or not.  And if they find it or if they say it
doesn't exist, I want to consider their reasons.  That's
what we usually do.
But they haven't really given us reasons,
other than to say the statute requires it, but I don't
see why.
MR. PETERSON:  Justice Sotomayor, with
respect to the Fifth Circuit, I believe, I would hope,
that we've supplied the reasonings -- reasoning for why
the Fifth Circuit's decision on equitable tolling is
correct.
With respect to the agency determinations,
the Board of Immigration Appeals, with rare
exceptions -- and there's no suggestion that this case
is one -- will follow the authority of the circuit in
which it sits.  So you can certainly find numerous
unpublished Board of Immigration Appeals decisions
applying equitable tolling to the statutory deadline,
but they do so primarily because they are following the
circuit authority.
Now, the government agrees with us that the
Board of Immigration Appeals has not independently
interpreted the statute in a way that would receive
Chevron deference to require equitable tolling.  So
right now, I don't believe the board has taken an
official position, except for in the government's brief,
that equitable tolling of the statutory deadline is
available.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The odd thing with
saying --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's -- that's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- the Fifth Circuit
was right in saying we -- we -- so -- so we're going to
give the Petitioner another chance, we'll consider it
under sua sponte.  But the board said twice that its
power to reopen on its own motion is not meant as a cure
for filing defects or otherwise circumvent the
regulation.
So I think what they're saying is that if
there's a -- if there's a flaw, if the 90 days -- if the
90 days is -- can't be stretched, then we shouldn't
reach that same conclusion by saying, oh, but we can do
this sua sponte.
They -- they seem to be saying their
exercise of their sua sponte authority is controlled by,
do we have a rule that says 90 days and no more?  If we
do have such a rule, we shouldn't be exercising our
authority sua sponte to get around that.  And that's --
that's in the Petitioner Appendix at both 5 and 9, when
they say we shouldn't use our power to reopen on our own
motion that way, to get around what is the rule.
MR. PETERSON:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  We do
think the Board of Immigration Appeals certainly uses
its sua sponte authority to reopen sparingly and
respectfully of the statutory deadlines.  As we see
here, the problem is giving effect to a deadline that
Congress set.  Congress certainly meant something when
it required these motions to reopen to be filed within
90 days.
And that means that the board's decision
whether to reopen sua sponte, in order to exist
alongside and not simply swallow that statutory
deadline, needs to be in some way different in kind.
And we think the way that it's different is that when
the board is reopening sua sponte, when it's considering
reopening on its own motion, that's a decision that is
wholly in the board's discretion, and that is
unreviewable in the courts under Heckler v. Chaney.
And so when an alien properly invokes the
statutory authority for reopening, the ability to reopen
within the 90 days that we all agree under Kucana is
reviewable, it's, of course, reviewable.  When the alien
misses that statutory window, when he asks the board to
reopen after the 90-day period is done, the board's
decision whether or not to grant or to reopen is wholly
in the board's discretion.
So when an alien asks the board to reopen --
and I think this case is the best example.  When you
look at the request for reopening, you don't see, please
reopen using your statutory authority.  You don't see,
please reopen using your sua sponte authority to reopen.
You simply see, Board of Immigration Appeals, please
reopen my case.
The way you determine what the true nature
of the board's authority is for the decision that it's
denying is whether that motion was filed within the
statutory time limit or without.
So if the court of appeals looks at it and
determines the alien asked for reopening after the end
of the statutory deadline, the answer there is that the
board's decision, its order that says, we deny
reopening, is wholly within the discretion of the board
and is unreviewable under Heckler v. Chaney.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so you -- you say the
Fifth Circuit did not implicitly hold that there was no
review of -- of the statutory deadline period --
MR. PETERSON:  As we understand --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- because you think the
Fifth Circuit read the -- the board's decision, since it
came after the 90 days, to be a sua sponte decision and,
hence, nonreviewable.
But that's not consistent with their earlier
decisions, which said, we're going to interpret it this
way because we have no jurisdiction to do it if you
interpret it the other way.
I mean, they didn't say that, if it's after
the 90 days, the -- the board should consider it to be
an appeal to its sua sponte authority.  They said, since
we believe that -- that there is -- that there is no
extension of the 90-day period under the statute, in
order to help the Petitioner, we're going to interpret
it as a request for review of the sua sponte authority.
Isn't that -- isn't that what they said.
MR. PETERSON:  Yes, Your Honor, but we see
the two as essentially indistinguishable.  Because the
Petitioner's request came after the expiration of the
90-day period, it could have been granted only through
the board's exercise of its sua sponte authority.  And a
decision whether to grant or deny the board's exercise
of its sua sponte, in our view, is unreviewable.
Let me point out one possible concern in
writing an opinion here.  And that's the habeas context.
As the Court's aware, prisoners can be quite creative in
attempting to circumvent the bar on second or successive
petitions under 2254 and 2255 and will frequently file
motions captioned under 2241 or possibly obscure common
law writs, seeking relief that's properly available
under 2254 or 2255.
In those circumstances, the district courts
will properly look at the merits of petitioner's
request, determine that it is a request that could truly
be granted only under 2254, 2255, and whatever the
caption the prisoner has placed on it will enforce
AEDPA's jurisdictional bar.
And finally, with respect to merits of
equitable tolling, we would simply note that, in our
view, Justice Ginsburg, I believe the Fifth Circuit has
already determined that Petitioner's motion to reopen
was untimely.  And in the event that the Court remands
to the Fifth Circuit without addressing anything other
than the jurisdictional question, the inevitable result
in the Fifth Circuit would simply be to deny on the
merits, which is a result that would not lead to any
greater benefit for Petitioner.
If there are no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Fleming, you have four minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I -- I would simply clarify the -- the issue
raised, I think, first by Justice Kagan, but then by
others, as to whether there was any confusion in either
the board or the Fifth Circuit as to what relief my
client was seeking.
In the board decision, on page 7 of the
Petition Appendix, the board makes clear that it
understands that Mr. Mata was seeking tolling.  It says,
in bringing this untimely motion to reopen, the
Respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel, and
then a description of matter of Lozada.  And then the
board says, and the time for filing a motion to reopen
may be tolled.  In cases of ineffective --
ineffectiveness of counsel, the alien must show that he
was prejudiced by counsel's performance.  And then the
analysis of this particular case continues.
And in the Fifth Circuit, the panel opinion
says, when it is summarizing the decision or the
proceedings below -- and this is on page 2 of the
Petition Appendix -- Mata subsequently filed an untimely
motion to reopen his removal proceedings based on a
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and asking
the BIA to equitably toll the applicable finding --
filing period, or exercise its authority to reopen his
proceedings sua sponte.
The Fifth Circuit knew exactly what was
going on.  There was a request for statutory tolling or
sua sponte reopening.
So I don't mean to be ungenerous to this
circuit at all.  I think they got this exactly right.
They understood the nature of the relief requested.
Where they went wrong is they believed they lacked
jurisdiction over the first request, and that everything
had to fall into the second request, where they believe
they also lacked jurisdiction.  And so they dismissed
the entire petition.  That error --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you --
MR. FLEMING:  -- is the one that should
be --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- do you disagree with
Mr. Peterson that if we were simply to say, Fifth
Circuit, you have jurisdiction to decide this issue of
equitable tolling, that then the -- from what they've
done so far, the likelihood is they'll say, fine, we
have jurisdiction, there is no equitable tolling?
MR. FLEMING:  I do disagree because I don't
think that's a foregone conclusion.  I think there is
every likelihood that the Fifth Circuit, once freed from
its erroneous view that it is bound by panel precedent
or by some other principle to not exercise appellate
jurisdiction, will then look at the reasoning that other
courts of appeals, every other court of appeals to have
addressed this, have applied, and conclude that there
is, in fact, equitable tolling.
Will they review Mr. Mata's appeal on the
merits and necessarily rule in his favor?  I think they
should and those are the arguments we will press on the
merits.
But I don't think that it's our burden to
show ultimate victory on every issue in order to show
that the Fifth Circuit misconstrued its jurisdiction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What -- what of the
argument that -- that the presumption of equitable
tolling applies to statutes of limitations, but not for
procedural time limits like this?
MR. FLEMING:  Our -- our position, Justice
Ginsburg, as laid out in our reply brief, is that this
is a statute of limitations.  It serves the policies
that this Court recognized in Young that are advanced by
a statute of limitations, namely, the advancing of
repose.  It will ensure in most cases that after 90
days, the BIA's order of removal will be final, and it
does also encourage the bringing of timely -- a prompt
motion to reopen claims, so that they are not lagging on
for a long time.  And that was Congress's intent.
None of that is inconsistent with tolling.
This Court has said repeatedly in cases like Bowen and
Holland that when you have a situation like extreme
misconduct by counsel, where there is a -- an
extraordinary hurdle that diligence will not get you
over, it is consistent with the principle of -- of
statute of limitations to allow tolling to proceed.  And
we submit that this is not a situation where the
presumption is actually rebutted or does not apply.
I'd say a word about the agency context
because it is something that has been brought up on both
sides -- I apologize.  I will not say that.
We would respectfully submit that the
judgment should be reversed and the case remanded.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you.
Mr. Peterson, this Court appointed you to brief and
argue this case as an amicus curiae in support of the
judgment below.  You have ably discharged that
responsibility, for which we are grateful.
The case is submitted.
