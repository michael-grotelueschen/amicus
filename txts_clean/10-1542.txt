CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 10-1542, Holder v. Gutierrez,
and the consolidated case.
Ms. Kruger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Under section 1229b of Title 8, an alien who
has not been a lawful permanent resident for at least 5
years, or who has not continuously resided in the United
States for at least 7 years following admission in any
status, is not eligible for cancellation of removal
under the first prong of the statute. That is true
regardless of whether the alien can show that his
parents, or any other third party, for that matter, did
satisfy those requirements.
The Ninth Circuit, alone among the courts of
appeals, has recognized a rule of imputed eligibility
under section 1229b(a). That rule is wrong for at least
two reasons. First of all, it is inconsistent with the
plain text of the statute.
The touchstones of eligibility under section
1229b(a), LPR status, admission, and residence, are all
terms that are defined in the INA to refer to attributes
that are individual to the alien seeking relief,
attributes that cannot be satisfied by a third party.
But even if the statute were thought to be
ambiguous with respect to this question, the Board of
Immigration Appeals has interpreted the statute to mean
that the alien seeking relief must personally and
actually satisfy both durational requirements. That
interpretation is at the very least a reasonable reading
of the statute, if not the only reasonable reading of
the statute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But did it make that
determination as a legal matter or as an exercise of its
discretion? As I read its opinion, it felt that it had
to come to that conclusion as a matter of law.
MS. KRUGER: I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we were to find the
statute ambiguous, where has it explained its policy
decisions independent of its legal conclusions?
MS. KRUGER: First of all, Justice
Sotomayor, we don't think the statute is ambiguous; and
so, we don't think there's any reason to go to Chevron
step two in this case.
But if you look at the Board's decision in
Escobar in particular, I think the Board makes clear
that, although it thought the statutory language was
clear, it also rested its decision on other
considerations that are uniquely within the Board's
expertise. It discussed how the imputation rule
comports with the general policies of the statute, how
it comports with the rule that the Board itself has
recognized over time, that LPR status is something
that's individual to a particular alien, and that the
alien seeking relief has to individually, both
procedurally and substantively, satisfy the eligibility
requirements.
And it also noted that the imputation rule
would create significant holes in the statutory scheme.
It would mean that an individual who may not even have
been eligible for admission to the United States or
lawful admission for permanent residence would
nevertheless receive a significant benefit that goes
along with that status.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say that you
think the statute is unambiguous, but it -- it doesn't
address issues of imputation at all, does it?
MS. KRUGER: It does not address issues of
imputation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it doesn't
even address it, it seems to me the best you can say is
that it's ambiguous.
MS. KRUGER: Well, I don't think that a
statute, as this Court has recognized, has to address
every conceivable possibility in order to be
unambiguous. And this statute, I think, is unambiguous
in that it refers to eligibility requirements that are
by their nature, as defined in immigration law,
individual to a specific alien. There's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- there
was -- wasn't there in the prior law a child domicile --
a child was able to satisfy the 7-year requirement based
on the parent's domicile, which was deemed to be the
child's?
MS. KRUGER: Right. There -- the
Respondents relied very heavily on three court of
appeals cases that had interpreted the predecessor to
this statute, former section 212(c), to allow imputation
of a parent's domicile to a child. Those courts relied
on the common law rule that a child's domicile follows
that of his parents. And applying that rule, they
allowed children to rely on their parents' domicile in
the United States to satisfy the 7-year lawful
unrelinquished domicile requirement in that statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess a child doesn't
have any domicile except the parents'; right? Children
who run away from home do not acquire new domiciles, do
they?
MS. KRUGER: Under this Court's decision in
Holyfield, the common law rule is that the child's
domicile is determined by that of his parents,
regardless of where the child resides in fact. When
Congress repealed former section 212(c) and enacted the
current cancellation of removal statute, it removed any
reference to the word "domicile," instead replacing the
requirement of 7 years unrelinquished domicile with two
durational requirements that are at issue in this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that change alone
sufficient for us to say that this is -- was a clear
indication by the Congress of an intent or purpose to
alter the imputation rule?
MS. KRUGER: I think if this Court is
willing to presume along with Respondents that Congress
would have been aware of these three court of appeals
decisions that were issued, it should be noted, very
late in the life of a provision that had existed in more
or less the same form since the Immigration Act of 1917,
then the Court also must presume that Congress was aware
that the basis for those decisions was the common law
definition of the term "domicile" and that Congress
meant what it did when it replaced "domicile" with three
eligibility criteria that are defined terms in the
immigration law and all of which refer to attributes
that are individual to a specific alien.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does a child who is not
emancipated have the capacity to independently establish
a residence?
MS. KRUGER: Under the -- how the INA
defines the term "residence" is an actual principal
dwelling in fact. So, yes, a child will dwell somewhere
in fact and can do so independent of a parent. That is
in marked contrast to the common law rule of domicile
that this Court explained at length in its Holyfield
decision and that the courts of appeals applied in
interpreting former section 212(c).
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can a parent ask for a
permanent resident status for a 5-year-old child?
MS. KRUGER: Yes, a parent could.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if you have two cases,
one -- two 5-year-olds. One, as in this case, lives
with the parent, but the application has not been
granted or not been filed; and the other, the
application has been granted. And they're treated --
they're treated differently?
MS. KRUGER: I think that's right,
Justice Kennedy. And I think that that is a necessary
corollary of the way the immigration system is
constructed. As a general rule, LPR status and
admission are criteria that are individual to a
particular alien. To be sure, minor children of lawful
permanent residents receive a high preference in the
immigration visa system.
But there's no rule that says that children
automatically receive the same legal status as their
lawful permanent resident parents.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming we don't accept
Respondents' -- what appears to be their argument, that
being an LPR is not a requirement of the statute, if we
assume that being an LPR is what triggers the
availability for the Attorney General's exercise of
discretion, how does that -- how does the imputation
rule harm the statute? The child has lived with the
parents for 5 years, whether before or after -- well,
after, it wouldn't be an issue, but before the grant of
LPR status. How does that harm the purposes of the
statute?
I thought the idea of the statute was to
give individuals who had ties to the United States an
opportunity to stay. If a child's been with their
parents for 5, 10, 15 years, what sense does it make to
deprive them of the Attorney General's exercise of
discretion merely because the administrative process has
taken too long to give them something which they're
going to get and which they've gotten?
MS. KRUGER: I think it's worth separating
out two different components of the cancellation of
removal decision. It is certainly true that it's an
important criteria, in determining whether or not an
individual is entitled as a matter of discretion to
cancellation of removal relief, how strong their ties
are to the United States, what their family ties are and
so on. But it has never been thought that particularly
compelling reasons for the exercise of discretion can
overcome the plain threshold requirements for
eligibility for the exercise of discretion under 1229b.
The difficulty with the imputation rule that
the Ninth Circuit has recognized is that it undermines
the plain requirements for those threshold
determinations of eligibility, conferring an important
benefit that goes along with long-time permanent
resident status and long-time continuous residence after
admission on individuals who not only did not receive
the necessary formal authorization from immigration
officials at the requisite time; they may not even have
been eligible to receive those authorizations.
I think it's also worth noting that this
statute is not the beginning and the end of discretion
in the immigration system. It is always true, and it is
-- certainly was the case when Congress enacted the
statute in 1996, that immigration officials have the
discretion not to bring removal proceedings in the first
place, to terminate removal proceedings once they have
begun, to defer action on the execution of a removal
order. And current immigration and customs enforcement
guidance makes clear that a minor receives particular
consideration within the totality of the circumstances
in determining whether or not prosecutorial discretion
is something that should be exercised.
JUSTICE BREYER: So, how does it work? I'm
-- how does it work? Two legal permanent residents, a
man and his wife, happen to show up in New York, and
they have a 6-month-old child. All right. What's the
legal -- why doesn't the INS just take the child, ship
him off? I mean there -- is it just discretion? Or is
there some rule of law or regulation that prevents that
from happening?
MS. KRUGER: It will depend on the
individual circumstances.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no. I've given you
the hypothetical. I mean, there we are.
MS. KRUGER: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's all you know.
MS. KRUGER: So, Congress has taken some
steps with respect to some subset of aliens.
Respondent, for example, brings up the LIFE Act, and
that is an example of where Congress has taken a step
to --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not asking for that.
I'm saying, what in the law -- that's all you know. All
right? There are -- you know the hypothetical.
I want -- one possible thing to say would be
that child is -- is actually -- we are imputing that
he's here for lawful permanent residence, too. Every
circuit had had some kind of imputation rule, and
moreover there are other areas of law where I have found
imputation rules in the immigration law. Roughly, I
have three or four cases on that. But they're --
they're not exactly comparable.
Okay. So, I just want to know what is it
that prevents you from taking the child and shipping him
off to China if we don't impute?
MS. KRUGER: Well, I think the answer is
certainly not that we impute the admission of the -- as
to child.
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not asking that. You
know the question. I just want your best effort --
MS. KRUGER: So, if there --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- to give an answer. Or
I'm thinking that your answer is there is nothing; it's
either imputation or nothing.
MS. KRUGER: Well, I think that that's --
JUSTICE BREYER: And you don't want me to
reach that conclusion.
MS. KRUGER: No, I think that that's
incorrect. There are certain provisions of law that
would allow for the child to be admitted but on an
independent basis from the parents. If a child is not
admissible --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the supposition -- if
the supposition is that the parents -- I think
Justice Breyer's supposition was that both parents were
LPRs. The likelihood of the 6-month-old child being
born in the United States and therefore being a citizen
would be rather large.
MS. KRUGER: Well, that's certainly right.
It is also true that --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. That isn't my
hypothetical.
(Laughter.)
MS. KRUGER: Right. The child in your
hypothetical -- the child is not born in the United
States, right?
If the child does not independently satisfy
the criteria for admissibility, then the child has
entered the United States illegally and remains here at
the discretion of immigration officials.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose if they come with
somebody else's 6-month-old child, they'd have to send
that child back to China, too, wouldn't they?
MS. KRUGER: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Which would be very sad,
but that would be the law, right?
MS. KRUGER: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: Actually they came from
Italy, in my hypothetical.
(Laughter.)
MS. KRUGER: I mean, I think that
Martinez --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They should not have sent
him back to China, then. Why did they do that?
(Laughter.)
MS. KRUGER: I think that Martinez
Gutierrez's situation, I think, is a good example of
this. He entered the United States illegally with the
-- with his parents and remained here illegally until he
was admitted as an LPR at the age of 19 as an adult.
Until that time, there were no efforts to remove him
from the United States, and I think that that's fairly
typical, but that's not because his parents' admission
or their lawful status in the United States was imputed
to Martinez Gutierrez, and there is no background
principle in the law that would allow for such
imputation of an individual formal authorization to
remain in the country by immigration officials to be
imputed from one to another.
Rather, the immigration system sets up a
system in which a lawful permanent resident parent can
seek to -- to petition for an immigration visa on behalf
of a child and facilitate that child's eventual
adjustment to lawful permanent resident status, but it's
not something happens automatically. It's something
that happens through a regular, orderly process.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an example
of an instance in which a child who is the child of two
lawful permanent residents cannot get lawful permanent
resident status for himself at the age of 8, but that he
can at the age of 15? I mean, what commonly happens
between that period that would make him ineligible --
eligible only when he is 15, other than just as a matter
of providing all the documents?
MS. KRUGER: That would make him ineligible
at the age of 15?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you -- the whole
point here is that some children are given lawful
permanent resident status and -- and some are not. But
I'm asking, does the passage of time, assuming two
lawful resident parents, ever make it so that a child
who was formerly ineligible is now eligible? He was
ineligible at 5, but he's eligible at 14? I mean, how
does that work?
MS. KRUGER: I think the most common
scenario is one in which a visa number doesn't become
available until the child is -- is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I don't mean a visa
number. But nothing -- nothing with -- with respect to
the child's real status other than his -- where he is on
the queue in the immigration department?
MS. KRUGER: That would be the most common
scenario, is -- is where the child is in the queue. And
I think Respondents place a great deal of emphasis on
the amount of time it takes for visa numbers to become
available for both children and spouses of lawful
permanent residents, but that has been a regular and
acknowledged feature of the immigration system for
decades.
The Congress that enacted IIRIRA in 1996 was
well aware of the waiting times for these visa numbers.
It had before it proposals for reducing the backlog, and
it rejected those proposals. It enacted in the
cancellation of removal statute two eligibility criteria
that do not turn on potential eligibility for receiving
LPR status or admission to the United States but,
instead, turn on actually having received that formal
authorization from immigration officials.
And I think that the best inference that we
can draw from the statutory language is that Congress
meant what it said; it attached special significance to
that formal authorization, the formal exercise of
authority by immigration officials, and not simply the
potential for that exercise in the future.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kruger, you take a
statute that doesn't say anything about imputation one
way or the other, and you say that statute can still be
unambiguous. And that would I think be true as a
general matter. But now you add to that statute a
history and a tradition and a practice in immigration
law of imputation of various kinds. One is imputation
of domicile in the way we talked about, but there are
other imputations that occur throughout the field of
immigration law. Some cut for the alien; some cut
against the alien.
In the world of that practice and tradition,
are you at least in a sphere in which there's ambiguity,
in which the agency essentially has discretion to decide
whether it wants to impute in this way?
MS. KRUGER: I think the answer is "no,"
Justice Kagan, because the other circumstances in which
imputation had been allowed under the immigration laws
differ in very important respects from the imputation --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But none of them are
textually commanded; is that right? I mean, the --
they're all situations in which the agency has decided
that there are good reasons to impute various factors.
MS. KRUGER: Well, I don't think that the
only reason that the agency has allowed for imputation
is that there is good reason as a general policy matter.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I can't hear you
very well. Would you --
MS. KRUGER: Certainly.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you crank up the thing
or something?
MS. KRUGER: I will.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you.
MS. KRUGER: I'll try to speak more directly
into the microphone.
The reason the -- the agency has allowed for
imputation in other circumstances is with respect to
certain inquiries that involve an inquiry into the
alien's intent. So, for example, the Board has allowed
for imputation under section 1182(k), which provides for
-- for discretionary relief from the Attorney General
when an immigrant did not know or could not have known
that they were inadmissible. And the Board has said
that, for those purposes, the parents' knowledge of
inadmissibility is imputed to the minor child. So, too,
in the context of abandonment of LPR status. The Board
has said --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That first one
usually cuts against the immigrant, I would assume. So,
if the parents knew, the child knows, and the child
normally would not know, right?
MS. KRUGER: Well, that's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MS. KRUGER: That's correct. But I think
the critical point is that the agency has interpreted
imputation of intent, of state of mind, to be
permissible, in part for the same reason that the common
law rule about domicile formed, which is that --
JUSTICE KAGAN: So, you think that all the
imputations that exist in immigration law are all a
matter of imputing intent?
MS. KRUGER: I think that that's -- all of
the imputations that Respondents have pointed to concern
state of mind type requirements. They don't concern
formal authorizations by immigration officials. The
Board, I think, has been very consistent, certainly in
the context of cancellation of removal, in not imputing
the legal status of being an LPR or admission from
parent to child. And it's difficult to see any other
examples in which such imputation would be permissible,
in part because the background presumption of the
immigration law is that those are both attributes that
have to be individually achieved and the eligibility
criteria have to be independently satisfied by each
individual alien.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why is a parent's
fraudulent conduct imputed to a child? There's no
intent there. The child obviously doesn't have an
intent or couldn't have an intent to commit a crime.
So, why is that imputed by the BIA?
MS. KRUGER: Well, I don't --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Other than that it's a
holding against the immigrant, which your adversary
points out is not a very favorable outlook for the
agency, that it only imputes when it harms the
immigrant. But, putting that aside, there's no intent
involved in the fraud. It's just the commission of an
act.
MS. KRUGER: Well, I think that where the
imputation has come in, in the Board's analysis, is with
respect to the state of mind and not with respect to the
objective conduct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the state of mind
of committing an act, like a fraudulent act?
MS. KRUGER: It's -- I think where this has
come up is in the context of knowing that the -- that
the alien is not in fact admissible to the United
States, is generally where it's come up. I'm not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The child doesn't commit
a fraudulent act.
MS. KRUGER: But, again, I think that the
principle that the Board has applied is that, because
the child is presumed not capable of forming a requisite
intent, the parent's intent is imputed to the child.
But I think for present purposes the
critical point is, even in that context, what is being
imputed is not a formal status conferred on an
individual alien by immigration officials, or admission,
a formal authorization to enter the country. That is,
again, conferred on an individual basis by immigration
officials. I think Respondents can identify no
circumstance, no precedent, for that type of imputation,
and it's one that would be inconsistent with the basic
structure of the immigration system.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They do say --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little odd that the
domicile is the more exacting of the two requirements,
and yet the Congress allowed imputation in the domicile
case but not -- not in the residence case. It seems
almost backward.
MS. KRUGER: Well, to be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Congress enacts a more
forgiving and less exacting standard, but then takes
away the imputation.
MS. KRUGER: Well, to be clear,
Justice Kennedy, Congress did not supply a definition of
the term "domicile." And so, the court of appeals
opinions that Respondents are relying on followed the
common law rule that says that a child's domicile
follows that of his parents, but those courts applied
that rule in very different ways.
Two courts of appeals permitted children to
benefit from the domicile of their parents in the United
States even when they were not even physically present
in the United States for the full 7-year period; whereas
the Ninth Circuit, for its part, applied that rule only
where the alien child had been -- had entered the United
States lawfully with his parents, according to the Ninth
Circuit, remains lawfully in the United States
thereafter, and simply had become an LPR outside of the
full 7-year period.
In crafting the current cancellation of
removal statute, there's no reason to believe that
Congress was aware of these three court of appeals
opinions that were, again, decided very late in the life
of former section 212(c). But even if it had been aware
of those decisions, it also would have been aware that
by using defined terms in the INA that are defined in a
way that's individual to the particular alien, it was
eliminating any reference to the common law rule.
Unlike domicile, there is no rule that says
that a child's LPR status follows that of his parents or
that a child's admission follows that of its parents.
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how -- were you
finished?
MS. KRUGER: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how the -- you
can read the Lepe-Guitron -- that was one of the cases
-- it seems to me clearly imputes residence as well.
They quote the earlier case from the circuit which said
the 7 years of domicile have to come after their
admission for permanent residence. And then the dissent
says, hey, what about permanent residents? And what
they say is this case is different because, in that
earlier case, the parents had never been admitted. He
came after he was married in this case. He's here after
his parents were admitted. Now, I grant you they didn't
explicitly say this, but I don't see how they reached
their conclusion without it.
And then there's a different split in the
circuits about the pro and con of tacking on periods,
you know, before the domicile, after, et cetera. And
that seems to be what Congress resolved.
So, I think if you're talking about what was
the law, the law was you did impute with -- you did
impute for residence. And then Congress sort of just
doesn't deal with that and deals with a slightly
different thing. Is that a fair reading, or what do you
think?
MS. KRUGER: I don't think it is, but first
I'd like to clarify that the Ninth Circuit had no reason
to impute residence in Lepe-Guitron, in part because the
alien in that case had resided in fact in the United
States throughout the 7-year period. I think
Respondents make the argument that Lepe-Guitron was in
fact imputing LPR status, as opposed to residence in
fact.
But I think that that is an incorrect
reading of the Ninth Circuit's decision as well, and
that's for the following reason: All three courts of
appeals that Respondents rely on dealt separately with
the threshold requirement under former section 212(c)
that the alien be a lawful permanent resident. None of
those three courts permitted LPR status to be imputed
from parent to child. So, where there was an explicit
requirement in the statute that LPR status be obtained
by the alien seeking relief, the courts were very clear
in requiring that the alien before them independently
satisfied that requirement.
In Lepe-Guitron, the Ninth Circuit
acknowledged that, under circuit precedent, it had held
that domicile requires an intent to remain permanently
in the United States lawfully and said that that meant
that the alien had to be in LPR status. Lepe-Guitron
said that with respect to children, that intent to
remain in the United States lawfully need not be an LPR
status so long as their parents were lawfully domiciled
in the United States.
If the Court has no further questions, I'd
like to reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Kinnaird.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN
NO. 10-1542
MR. KINNAIRD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Children present special problems under the
immigration laws, and, as discussed, both the courts and
the agency in various contexts have resorted to
imputation to cure those problems. And here the -- the
statute is silent as to imputation, and ambiguity arises
as applied to the special circumstance of children who
were minors during the years in question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know
whether -- I'm having trouble applying the concepts of
unambiguous and ambiguous in this situation. As far as
I can tell, this is something that the statute just
doesn't deal with, and I don't know that you
characterize that correctly as ambiguous. It's just
kind of off the table.
MR. KINNAIRD: I think it's ambiguous as
applied to this specific circumstance. And the
ambiguity arises because the requirements for which
there is imputation, status and residency, are matters
that are not within the capacity or the control of a
minor. A minor does not decide whether or when a parent
will apply for LPR status for him or her. He does not
control the -- the maintenance of that status over a
period of years, and he also does not control where he
resides.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, can you give any
example -- the Government says you can't -- of an
instance where status is imputed, not intent, but just
status; where the status that the parents have is
automatically given to the child or, for that matter,
automatically taken away from the child?
MR. KINNAIRD: Section 212(c) imputed
status, as the Ninth Circuit found. The reason was that
the requirement there was not just for unrelinquished
domicile but lawful unrelinquished domicile, and,
therefore, they had to reach back to the period in which
the parent was an LPR --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But there -- there, you --
what they're imputing is the intent to remain in the
place, right? And that's -- that's an -- that's intent.
That's imputing intent.
MR. KINNAIRD: No, they also had to impute
lawfulness, which meant that the parent had to be an LPR
for that period or at least in some lawful status. And
in each of the three instances, the parents were LPRs in
the times in question. So, there definitely was a
foregoing rule of imputation of status. And I would
submit that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And the child would not
have been lawfully there but for the imputation of
lawfulness from the parents.
MR. KINNAIRD: That's right. He -- well, he
would not have qualified for -- for a waiver of removal.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kinnaird, I take it that
the point you're making is the statute is ambiguous in
the sense that its silence does not prevent the BIA from
making this imputation if it wants to. But the BIA
clearly doesn't want to. So, where does that leave you?
MR. KINNAIRD: Well, I think if it is
ambiguous, then the BIA actually has to exercise its
discretion and grapple with that ambiguity. And that is
one of the fundamental problems, as Justice --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, are you saying that
the BIA needs to write an opinion that says now we are
doing Chevron step two analysis? Is that what you're
saying, that this is a matter of labeling?
MR. KINNAIRD: I don't think it's a matter
of -- of magic words, but what it has to do is actually
grapple with and recognize the ambiguity, at least in
the alternative, and then exercise its discretion to say
if this is a permissible construction of the Act and
there's another permissible construction, which of the
two better serves the statutory purpose.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it doesn't have
to grapple with everything that's not there. I mean,
there are a lot of things that the statutes don't
address.
MR. KINNAIRD: Agreed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that
they don't have to grapple with everything that's there.
You just have to say this doesn't address it. So,
whoever is asking for the affirmative, which is you,
loses.
MR. KINNAIRD: I don't think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're saying: We
think this law should allow -- should provide for this,
should be extended for this. And it's one thing to say,
well, the statute's ambiguous; it talks about children
in one category but not in another category; so, the
issue's there; we don't know what they meant. It's
another thing if it's something that's totally not on
the table. I mean, if -- if you claimed that the law
required every minor to get $500 a year, you wouldn't
say the statute was ambiguous about that. You'd say it
doesn't have anything to do with it.
MR. KINNAIRD: Well, that's right, Your
Honor, but I think the ambiguity arises here because the
matters in question are ones not within the capacity or
control of the minor, and that's been the traditional
basis on which the BIA has looked for imputation. And
when you take into account --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In your -- your
argument -- under your argument an alien, a child, who
never acquired LPR status in its own right could get a
cancellation of removal based on the parents' status.
MR. KINNAIRD: I don't think that's right.
The Ninth Circuit did not address that, but I think the
better reading of the statute, even if (a)(1) is
somewhat ambiguous on that point, is that you have to be
an LPR in order to seek cancellation. And then for
these durational requirements and the look-back to
status, there you do imputation.
And the reason is twofold. One, section
2(c), which it replaced, was limited to LPRs. The
second is that there is a separate subsection,
subsection (b), of that same statute. I don't believe
it's in the addenda provided to the courts, but it is
cancellation of removal for certain nonpermanent
resident aliens. And the critical distinction between
the two, besides differences in criteria, is that that
one authorizes adjustment of status as well as
cancellation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would --
MR. KINNAIRD: So, if you're not an actual
LPR, you need to have adjustment of status to -- to not
be in a legal limbo.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Kinnaird, what would
happen if the child remains with the grandparents in
Mexico and his parents are living in Los Angeles for 6
years until they can afford to take him. Is the
parents' residence then imputed to the child so that
when he moved to Los Angeles in year 7 he is deemed to
have been there for 6 years?
MR. KINNAIRD: I think if there's a
significant separation of that duration, I think there
would be a question about whether you have the
significant relationship between parent and child to
warrant imputation. But it is true that under former
section 212(c), at least in two of the cases, they
imputed residency where the child was not actually
resident.
JUSTICE BREYER: You had an example in your
brief, I thought -- you might -- I thought that it was
an example of status rather than intent. The example
that you gave -- I took that way; tell me if I'm -- is
where an alien comes in and wants asylum, and then you
can't get it if you were resettled in another country.
And there are criteria -- country with a resettlement
program. And then that seemed like a status, a
residence. Were you resettled in the other country or
were you not? That's his status, and then that's
imputed to the child.
MR. KINNAIRD: That's right. And the
resettlement doesn't have any element of intent to it.
So, it's not true that everything turns upon intent.
And I would also point out that, under
section (a)(1), it's not simply a requirement that there
have been some grant of LPR status at some point and
passage of 5 -- of 5 years. The statutory definition of
"lawfully admitted for permanent residence" includes a
requirement that the status has not changed. And that
requires domiciliary intent because the BIA has
interpreted that phrase to mean that you can change your
status by intent, and in fact the Department of Homeland
Security has defended against cancellation claims on the
grounds that there was abandonment during a -- during
the 5-year period. So, if you had a child coming forth,
you would have to look, in certain circumstances at
least, to the parent for intent of abandonment.
So, I think this is an element where there
is direct continuity from section 212(c). It makes
eminent sense. And even if the BIA is deemed to have
exercised its discretion here, I think its rule is
patently unreasonable, and for a number of reasons.
First, they're not able to advance a single
policy reason that would be favorable to non-imputation.
It destroys family unity, and it forecloses eligibility
for relief for even people like Mr. Martinez Gutierrez,
who has lived here since the age of 5.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- this Court has
dealt in the constitutional context with parent-child
relationships under the immigration law. And let's take
Fiallo v. Bell. There the Court said, well, it tells us
that for married parents it's this way, and for a child
born out of wedlock, that relationship is something
else. That could be considered quite arbitrary when the
question is, is the child left orphaned? But the Court
said, well, that's what the statute said. It made that
distinction, and the Court upheld it.
But there are a number of cases where there
is -- the statute does say, parent-child relationship,
this is imputed, that is not, and dealt -- the Court
dealt with that in Miller and Nguyen.
MR. KINNAIRD: Yes, Your Honor. I think
Congress has the latitude to be -- to draw arbitrary
lines. I don't think the agency does if imputation is a
permissible alternative. I think they have to give a
reasoned basis for denying imputation when it was the
prior rule.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't it -- why
can't the BIA adopt or why doesn't the background
principle apply that you're not entitled to admission
unless you make an affirmative case for it?
You say, well, the -- the government hasn't
advanced any policy reason on the other side. Why isn't
that the basic policy of the government?
MR. KINNAIRD: Well, I think they have to
look to the actual statute, and they have to give their
own reasons, which I don't think they've done adequately
as a matter of discretion. But here, this is a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it -- why isn't
it an adequate reason that they've come up with here and
in their decisions that the prior word was "domicile"
and a child's domicile is that of the parents, and that
the word under the new statute is "residence" and the
child's residence is not necessarily the residence of
the parent? That seems to me a perfectly valid reason.
MR. KINNAIRD: Well, I wouldn't say that's
Chevron step two discretion. But I think you also have
to look to the fact that there was not only imputation
of domicile; it required lawfulness. And -- and in
imputing domicile, they were also imputing residence.
So, it's true the word "domicile" has --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That may well be, but it's
a different word.
MR. KINNAIRD: It's a different word, yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And the one word demands
imputation; the other doesn't. So, I mean, I don't
think you can say there's no -- no rational basis given
by the agency.
MR. KINNAIRD: Well, the rational basis
comes in if -- if there's ambiguity and they're
determining why -- if it's a permissible construction,
why it should be rejected or not.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: One of the problems that
I have is that I see the imputation as an equitable
doctrine.
MR. KINNAIRD: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
means discretionary.
MR. KINNAIRD: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
And to me, that often
If it is that,
discretionary, I -- I don't know what more the BIA has
to say than "I don't want to," because it renders lots
of issues open, like what do we do with 1229b(a)(2)?
Isn't that an end run on stopping this continuous 7-year
statute, or 10, whatever it is, if we're imputing a
parent's residence or any of the things that you're --
that the government said, the BIA said, in rendering its
decision?
I mean, you can't force a court to -- the
BIA to impute. So, what more do they have to say than
we don't think it's consistent with the statute, even if
it is ambiguous to do this?
MR. KINNAIRD: Well, I would say the statute
has an equitable purpose which allows imputation. I do
not think there's discretion, if imputation is
permissible unless there's a rational basis in serving
the policies of the Act, to deny imputation. And
discretion does come in at the second phase, which is
when the Attorney General determines whether or not the
-- the cancellation should be granted.
So, we should bear in mind that this is a
statute strictly for eligibility, simply to get to the
phase where there's unreviewable discretion in the
Attorney General to deny relief. And this is a
once-in-a-lifetime remedy. You can only apply for
cancellation once in your life.
So, I think in the special circumstance of
children who were minors during the period, who could
not have controlled their status, could not have
controlled their residence, this is an eminently
reasonable rule that's backed by Congress.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's so reasonable
about a child who lives with their grandparents outside
the country? Why should their parents' being in the
U.S. be imputed to the benefit of that child? I
certainly understand it in your client's situation.
Your client is the one who has been here since 5 years
old.
MR. KINNAIRD: Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So --
MR. KINNAIRD: And if -- BIA, I think, would
be reasonable to draw a narrower rule, and we could
prevail under that rule, but I think the rationale is
family unity; that even though there are periods of
residence where there's a dysjunction, the real reason
is simply the operation of quotas. And -- and there was
a historical practice of allowing imputation of
residence. Since you still have the family ties, I
think imputation is permissible there, as long as you
have the significant relationship.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Kinnaird, I'm having
trouble figuring out, is your view that non-imputation
is just unreasonable per se, or is your view that they
didn't explain non-imputation properly?
MR. KINNAIRD: They are alternative
arguments. They certainly didn't explain it. I would
also say it's unreasonable per se: One, because they
have to deal with the fact of lack of custody and
control. That's been the basis for their abandonment
decisions. They have invoked imputation only to the
detriment of the alien where the child has no intent
whatsoever.
So, there's no common law principle for
imputing mens rea, for example, knowledge of
inadmissibility to a child; no basis for really imputing
an intent to abandon when the child has none whatsoever.
So, at the very least, they have to explain that.
And because -- and the BIA has also not
really taken into account the nature of these as simply
eligibility rules.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Kinnaird.
Mr. Rothfeld.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN
NO. 10-1543
MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
So far as subsection (2) of the provision
that we're talking about this morning, which is the
provision that concerns me in the Sawyers case, we think
that the Government's reading is simply not a sensible
approach to the statute. And in that sense, our
position is not that the statute is ambiguous. We think
that the statutory context and the particular meaning of
the words that Congress used require imputation in the
circumstances of this case.
I'll start with the statutory background,
where I think the Government understates the nature of
the prevailing settled rule that it applied.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We usually like to
start with the statutory language. Where is this issue
addressed in this statute at all?
MR. ROTHFELD: Imputation as such, as has
been said, is not directly addressed. But the words
that the -- that Congress used, the word "residence" and
the word -- particularly "continuous residence" are
words that Congress would have thought carried along
with it the concept of imputation. And the reason why
that is so, I think it's necessary to start with a
little bit of the background both of the statute and how
those words have been interpreted in prior usages.
Congress would have been aware of when it used them in
the statute.
Under the prior relief provision here,
section 212(c), the old provision, the courts that --
courts of appeals that had addressed it had uniformly
applied an imputation rule. The Government says it's
three courts. Two of those courts are the Second and
Ninth Circuits, the largest immigration circuits that
decide two-thirds of the immigration cases in the
country. So, I think one can presume that Congress
would have been aware of this rule.
And the Government concedes that Congress
didn't change the language of 212(c) because it was
dissatisfied with imputation. It had other purposes in
mind altogether. And so --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does the
statute say about imputation of individuals' residence
to grandparents?
MR. ROTHFELD: The rule -- it says nothing
directly about it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says nothing
about it. So, would you say the statute is ambiguous on
whether or not residents' legal permanent residence
status should be imputed to grandparents?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think there could be
circumstances in which imputation is appropriate when --
when the child is in the custody of the grandparent.
But I'm focusing on parents because that's how the cases
have been decided up to that point.
The BIA itself had said, prior to the
enactment of this statute, in the In re Ng case that --
which I think is the case the Justice Breyer had
referred to -- it had said in so many words the
residence of the parent is imputed to child when the
child is a minor. Congress would have been aware of
that when it used the word "residence" in
subsection (2).
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do -- what
you do if the parents -- the father is an LPR, the
mother is not? Do we then impute to the child the
father's status? The couple is not married.
MR. ROTHFELD: There are rules, common law
rules, that the courts had applied in determining whose
residence and whose domicile would be attributed to the
child when the parents were not -- didn't have joint
custody. When the -- if we're talking only about
residence here --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They have joint custody.
They live together. They're just not married.
MR. ROTHFELD: I think that -- again, the
courts have applied -- if we're distinguishing -- for
purposes of residence -- and I'm not talking about the
technical LPR status here when I'm using the term
"residence"; I am referring simply to kind of the
general common law concept.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I think it was
agreed that -- that LPR status would be necessary. At
least, Mr. Kinnaird said that.
MR. ROTHFELD: We --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, we're talking about
the 5-year period and the 7-year period. The child
would have to have LPR status.
MR. ROTHFELD: We agree ultimately, to get
relief, the child has to have LPR status and certainly
under subsection (1) of the provision, which is not at
issue in the Sawyers case. That concerns 5 years of LPR
status. Subsection(2), which is all that I'm concerned
with in Sawyers because that's the only -- only element
of the relief provision that he was deemed not to
satisfy, concerns only the term "residence," not LPR as
such; simply continuous residence in the United States.
And so, the question of would Congress have
thought that residence, continuous residence, is
imputable from parent to child -- I think it would have
for two reasons: First of all, it would have believed
that residence as a general matter is imputable. The
BIA had said so itself in the Ng case. And as it --
domicile, which the Government concedes was imputable,
necessarily includes --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Was residence
at issue in that case?
MR. ROTHFELD: It was indeed. It was a firm
resettlement case, and the question was whether or not
the alien had been a resident of Hong Kong. And the
parents were residents, and the BIA said, well, the
parents' residence is imputed to the child.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just for factual
correction, the record doesn't tell us whether he was
living with his mother -- Mr. Sawyer was living with his
mother.
MR. ROTHFELD: That's correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the answer to that
is? Is this a child living with a grandparent out of
the country or not?
MR. ROTHFELD: The record does not
reflect -- we don't know if he was living in U.S. in an
unlawful status up until the point he became an LPR at
age 15. The record simply doesn't answer that question.
JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying -- I just
want to hear your whole argument here. You're saying
they would have had, Congress, as a background, the Ng
case where they imputed the Hong Kong residence; the
fact that you were about to say, that domicile
necessarily includes residence. And is there something
else?
MR. ROTHFELD: That's the principle, but
that --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right.
MR. ROTHFELD: That's correct. That -- but
I can add to that a little bit, that in the section
212 cases, in which domicile was imputed, as the
Government recognizes, in at least two of those cases,
the child was not in the United States for a portion of
that time; and, therefore, necessarily those courts must
have been imputing not only domicile but residence. And
that is necessarily the case because -- residence is an
element, a subset, of domicile --
JUSTICE ALITO: So, if he came to the United
States at 15 from Jamaica, he was a resident of the
United States before he came --
MR. ROTHFELD: As a -- as a legal matter,
just as he was -- would have been domiciled in the
United States.
JUSTICE ALITO: Would he be a resident of
Jamaica, too, at that time?
MR. ROTHFELD: I think not. I think -- I
think our common law would have regarded him as a
resident of the United States --
JUSTICE ALITO: If his father was living in
the U.K., would he be a resident of the U.K.?
MR. ROTHFELD: There might be legal rules
that -- that specify the physical presence is equivalent
to residence for particular purposes. But as this Court
held in Holyfield, as the Government recognizes in a
domicile context, a child can be a domicile of a
jurisdiction in which they have never set foot. The
legal presumption is that a child is -- takes the
domicile of the parent, and -- and residence is a
necessary subset, as this Court has said long ago,
before any of these statutes were passed. The
definition --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you can be a resident
without being a domiciliary?
MR. ROTHFELD: One can be -- yes, because
the definition, as this Court said, of -- of "domicile"
is residence in a particular place accompanied by an
intent to remain there indefinitely. And so, you have
to have both. You can't be a domicile without being a
resident of the jurisdiction.
Congress would have been aware of that. And
when it used the term "residence," it would have been
aware of that as a general proposition, and it would
have been aware that in the particular context of
section 212(c), imputation rule for relief in the
immigration laws, that use of the term "resident"
carries with it imputation.
I think that makes this -- so far as we're
concerned, that makes the use of the term "continuous
residence" in subsection (b) unambiguous and requires
imputation. Congress would have been aware of this.
There's no reason to think, the Government concedes,
Congress was not trying to change the imputation rule
when it changed the terminology from -- from "domicile"
to "resident."
In fact, it's sort of perverse to say that
Congress had -- achieved that purpose, because it was
a -- this was a liberalizing change. The reason that
Congress -- it's quite clear from the statutory
background why Congress changed the language from 7
years' unrelinquished lawful domicile in the old 212(c)
to continuous residence after admission in any status in
-- in subsection (b) of the new statute -- was to
broaden the availability of relief.
Congress was confronted with a split in the
circuits on the interpretation of the old rule, as to
whether or not one could achieve unrelinquished
domicile -- lawful unrelinquished domicile while not in
an LPR status, because the BIA had taken the position
that for -- to have lawful domicile, you have to
lawfully intend to stay here permanently; you can't do
that if you're not an LPR.
And, therefore, Congress, confronting the
split on circuits -- because some courts had rejected
the BIA's view, Congress said, okay, we're going to put
in subsection (a) of the new statute a requirement of 5
years' LPR status.
JUSTICE ALITO: If Congress had wanted to
use the term "resided" in the ordinary sense of the
word, they wanted to require that the alien actually
have lived in the United States continuously for 7
years, what language would they have used? What
language should they have used?
MR. ROTHFELD: For -- for the child? Well,
I think --
JUSTICE ALITO: If they wanted (2) to mean
that the alien must have actually -- that person must --
the one who committed the crime later must actually have
resided in the United States continuously for 7 years --
MR. ROTHFELD: I would --
JUSTICE ALITO: -- then what should they --
actually lived in the United States for 7 years, what
language should they have used?
MR. ROTHFELD: For -- for an adult, the
language that they did use, because I think "continuous
residence" carries with it the requirement that the
person be physically present in the United States --
JUSTICE ALITO: For a minor.
MR. ROTHFELD: If they're a minor?
JUSTICE ALITO: For that to apply to
everybody.
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I would think, given the
context, of which imputation was the settled rule, that
Congress would have had to indicate affirmatively that
imputation was impermissible. Just as if -- if Congress
uses the term "domicile" as they did in the old section
212(c), knowing the context in which, as a universal
matter, the domicile of the parents is attributed to the
child, one would expect --
JUSTICE ALITO: "Domicile" is a legal term.
You don't go around and you meet somebody and say, Where
are you domiciled?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO: You might not even say,
Where do you reside? But it's closer to being ordinary
language.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well -- and "reside" can have
different meanings in different contexts. There is a
definition in the statute which the BIA itself has said
does not apply to conditional uses of the term. So, you
know, "residence" in its plainest sense -- I mean, as
this Court said in the Savorgnan case, which is where
Congress derived the -- the definition which is now in
the INA, that was under the plainest use of the term
"residence." You know, unadorned. And that was the
statutory definition, which says without regard to
intent.
But when there's a conditional use, when
it's continuous residence, as in subsection (b) of the
statute, or permanent residence, necessarily one has to
look at intent. And, therefore, that statutory
definition cannot apply. The BIA itself has said that
expressly in the Huang case, which we discuss in our
brief, that so far as permanent residence is concerned,
the statutory definition has no application because
necessarily one has to look to intent.
And so, this is sort of a second --
secondary argument here, but insofar as intent is
essential for imputation, which is what the Government
says -- the Government says the reason that the switch
from "domicile" to "residence" matters is because
"domicile" looks to intent, and "residence" doesn't.
But, in fact, continuous residence does, necessarily
does, look to intent because it's the intent to remain
continuously or permanently.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is there some
advantage to giving parents an incentive to apply for
early lawful permanent residence? Because under your
view, parents wouldn't have to bother to apply for it at
all. I'm -- I'm wondering about the --
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the consequences of
deciding in your favor. And the other one, quite
distinct, is it seems to me that there probably would
not be some floodgate of -- of imputed residence cases.
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I -- the only thing
we're talking about here, of course, is -- is a
particular relief from removal provision. And so,
certainly, the -- the expectation that the child someday
down the road may seek relief from removal --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.
MR. ROTHFELD: -- if they do -- if they
become an LPR and do something wrong is not going to
induce parents to delay.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rothfeld, I'm -- I'm
curious, how often -- this dispute here is simply about
whether the Attorney General is permitted to cancel
removal, right?
MR. ROTHFELD: That is correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How often does -- are
applications for cancellation of removal granted? I
mean, is it a common phenomenon, or are we really
talking here about just spinning it out longer so that
the -- so that the person who will ultimately be
deported can stay here that much longer?
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I can't give you current
statistics. I think this Court said, I believe in the
St. Cyr case, that a fairly -- substantial -- 40 percent
or so of the cases are granted. The Gutierrez case, in
fact, the IJ would have granted removal and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think it's as high as
40 percent?
MR. ROTHFELD: I believe that that's -- I
wouldn't swear to that, Your Honor, but -- but it is
a -- a significant percentage. And, again, Gutierrez is
an example of that. The IJ would have granted it but
for the -- the rejection of the imputation rule further
on in the -- in the process.
And I think this is actually kind of a
significant point, which goes to what Congress would
have had in mind. We are only talking about not
entitlement to relief; we're talking about entitlement
to ask the Attorney General, in the exercise of his
unreviewable discretion, to grant relief to deserving
immigrants who would otherwise be forced out of the
country by application of an inflexible rule.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose one of the
things he could take into account in exercising his
discretion is whether we're actually dealing with a
minor, or, as I understand in this case, it's someone
who is quite a bit older.
MR. ROTHFELD: He -- it is unreviewable
discretion, yes. He could take anything into account.
And, certainly, the nature of the family ties, the --
the background of the immigrant, all of those things are
taken into account. But the question -- whether or not
Congress when it passed this statute, knowing how
section 212(c) had been interpreted, the prospect that
Congress meant to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, that's a very
big assumption. I mean, yes, it's the two biggest
circuits who have defined domicile and imputation, but
it wasn't us, number one. And, number two, going back
to Justice Alito's question, they didn't adopt the same
word, "domicile"; they changed it. So --
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I can give you --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that's what the BIA
was saying.
MR. ROTHFELD: I can give you two responses
to that, if I may, Justice Sotomayor. First, yes, I
mean, it is a presumption that Congress is aware of
judicial decisions, but I think that presumption --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It can't be aware of all
judicial decisions.
MR. ROTHFELD: No, but in this particular
context, there's particular reason to think they were
because Congress, it is agreed, enacted this legislation
to cure a conflict in the circuits involving the
application of this cancellation provision. And so,
there would have been particular reason for Congress to
be aware of what the courts had done.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you said you
had two points. Do you want to get your second out, in
half a sentence?
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I can rest at this
point, Your Honor.
Thank you so much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.
Ms. Kruger, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. KRUGER: Thank you.
I'd like to make three quick points --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the Respondent said
that the BIA gave no policy reason, no policy
justifications, for its -- for its interpretation.
Is that correct in your view?
MS. KRUGER: I don't think that that is
correct. The BIA noted -- to be clear, the BIA was, I
think, heavily influenced by what it saw as the clear
language of the statute, but it also noted that the
imputation rule was inconsistent with a history of
non-imputation of LPR status, an approach that treats
LPR status as accorded to individual aliens.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you respond to the
point that lawfulness has been attributed, not just
intent, but under the prior law, lawfulness was also
attributed?
MS. KRUGER: I think this goes back to the
answer I was giving to Justice Breyer earlier. Where
former section 212(c) had an explicit lawful status
requirement, which is the status of being a lawful
permanent resident, no court of appeals allowed
imputation from parent to child.
Their argument is a little bit more
convoluted than that. It is that because domicile,
lawful unrelinquished domicile, was interpreted to mean
the ability to form a lawful intent to remain
permanently in the United States, and the Ninth Circuit
said you could only form such an intent if you are a
lawful permanent resident, that in Lepe-Guitron, the
Ninth Circuit was therefore necessarily imputing LPR
status from parent to child.
I think the more straightforward way to read
the Ninth Circuit's decision is that it was imputing the
intent to remain permanently in the United States from
parent to child, based in part on the parents'
establishment of a domicile, and based on the common law
rule that the child's domicile follows that of his
parents.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, in response
to Justice Kennedy's question about whether they gave a
policy reason, your answer was that they, you know,
followed the history. I'm not sure that's the same as a
policy.
MS. KRUGER: Well, in -- in addition to
discussing the individual nature of LPR status, they
also noted the consequence of the Ninth Circuit's
imputation rule would be to permit a kind of end run
around the substantive eligibility requirements for LPR
status. So, theoretically, you could have an individual
minor alien who's not eligible, who's inadmissible for
adjustment of status, who would nevertheless be accorded
a substantial benefit of that status without regard to
whether or not he could have received that status in
fact.
I want to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that the case under the
prior law?
MS. KRUGER: Under the -- under former
section 212(c).
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, when -- yes.
MS. KRUGER: Again, no court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's not unthinkable.
MS. KRUGER: No court had imputed LPR
status, the threshold requirement for relief under --
under the predecessor statute, from parent to child.
So, it wasn't the case that somebody who was actually
ineligible for -- for LPR status would nevertheless be
eligible for waiver of removal under -- under that
provision.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I just don't understand
that argument because they've conceded that you need
the -- the child needs their own LPR status before it
triggers --
MS. KRUGER: Right, and I think that
concession --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- residency.
MS. KRUGER: I think that concession is
important for the following reason: When Congress
enacted the present cancellation of removal statute, it
preserved that threshold requirement that you had to be
an LPR in order to seek relief, but it added a
durational requirement. You had to have attained that
status at least 5 years before you sought relief.
There's no reason to think, if there's no
precedent for imputing LPR status in the first place,
that there would be precedent for imputing LPR status
going back 5 years. One necessarily follows from the
other.
If I could, I'd like to address the other
proposition that Respondent Sawyers makes, that courts
were necessarily imputing residence as an element of
domicile. That argument relies heavily on the 1967
regional commissioner decision dealing with firm
resettlement.
If you look at that decision, you will see
that the regional commissioner focused very intensely on
the minor alien's particular actions -- identity,
documents that he received personally from the foreign
country, his own schooling, and residence. And the
degree to which the regional commissioner rested on
principles of imputation is entirely unclear.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
