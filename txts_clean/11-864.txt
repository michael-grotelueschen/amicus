Corporation v. Behrend.
Mr. Estrada.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The Third Circuit held in this case that the
assessment of the adequacy of expert evidence offered in
support of class certification is a merits question that
has no place in the class certification inquiry.
According to the Third Circuit and to the
plaintiffs in this Court, what is sufficient is for the
proponents of class certification to point to some
abstract methodology, such as econometrics or regression
analysis, that conceivably might be applied to the
problem at hand in a way in which, in the fullness of
time, will evolve into admissible evidence by the time
of the class trial.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Estrada, you are
limiting your argument to the determination of damages,
as I understand it.
MR. ESTRADA: I think you limited my
argument to determination of damages, Justice Ginsburg.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the -- because
the Third Circuit agreed that, as far as any antitrust
impact --
MR. ESTRADA: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that could be
established on a class basis.
MR. ESTRADA: We -- we, obviously -- as is
obvious from our cert petition, we do not agree with
that. For purposes of inquiring into the damages
question in this Court, I think we have to assume that
that is so. I think it doesn't change the
outcome with --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- why not?
Because, generally -- and at least it's my impression --
that in class certifications, if the liability question
can be adjudicated on a class basis, then the damages
question may be adjudicated individually.
Take a -- take a Title VII case. A
liability -- a pattern of practice of discrimination,
therefore, liability, but damages can be assessed on an
individual basis. So why isn't bifurcation possible
here?
MR. ESTRADA: Well, let me make two points
in response to that question, Justice Ginsburg: One
about what the legal standards are, and -- you know, the
second one, which is as important, about what the record
in this case is.
With respect to the first point, what the
rule asks us to look at is not questions of damages
versus liability, but whether the common questions
predominate over those that are individual to the class
members.
I don't disagree, and it is not my position
today that there may be cases in which individual
damages questions are consistent with class
certification. But as the lower courts have recognized,
it is not the case that all damages questions may -- may
remain individual consistently with class certification.
Indeed, the 1966 advisory notes expressly
say that questions of damages with respect to class
members may or may not predominate in cases like this;
i.e., antitrust class actions. Let --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Estrada, doesn't
Justice Ginsburg's question actually point out that
the -- the law that both district court and the
circuit court used in this case was actually quite
favorable to you?
Unlike some courts, both the district court
and the circuit court said that the plaintiffs needed to
show that there was a class-wide measurement of damages.
And then in addition, both courts said, really, it
was -- the burden was on the plaintiffs to demonstrate
that that class-wide measure of damages existed.
Now, I understand that you have problems
with the way in which the plaintiffs met that burden.
You say that they didn't meet that burden. But it seems
to me that the legal standard that was used was exactly
the legal standard that you wanted, that the plaintiffs
had to come in and show, by a preponderance, that they
had a class-wide way to measure damages in this case.
MR. ESTRADA: I don't think that's right,
Justice Kagan. I think we can have a healthy debate
about whether the district court did what you just
finished saying. I think there can be no debate that
the court of appeals did so because, repeatedly,
throughout its opinion, said that the questions as to
the adequacy of whether they had complied with the
Hydrogen Peroxide Standard was a merits question that
was for later adjudication in this case.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, here's what the
district court said. "The experts' opinions raise
substantial issues of fact and credibility that we are
required to resolve to decide the pending motion." That
is the motion for class certification.
"Having rigorously analyzed the experts'
reports, we conclude that the class has met its burden
to demonstrate that the element of antitrust impact is
capable of proof at trial through evidence that is
common to the class and that there is a common
methodology available to measure and quantify damages on
a class-wide basis."
So that seems to me exactly what you say
they should have done. Now, you disagree with their
ultimate determination, but not with the statement of
the law.
MR. ESTRADA: Well, I think that it is true
that our position in the district court was that
Hydrogen Peroxide controlled and that the district court
correctly stated the holding of the Third Circuit ruling
in that case.
Beyond that, I don't think that we do agree,
because, in the Third Circuit, once the case got there,
we got a rule of law saying that, although this court
prescribed the rule amendment, 23(f), precisely to
enable courts of appeals to review whether the district
court got it right for important policy questions, that
the job of the court of appeals under 23(f) can be fully
discharged by saying that providence will provide; we'll
think about it in the morning. And that is not
consistent with the proposition that the correct law was
applied in the lower courts.
Furthermore, although the district court did
enounce the correct standard in reflecting the holding
of Hydrogen Peroxide, it is far from apparent -- and
this is part of our point to the Third Circuit -- excuse
me -- to the Third Circuit -- which was not actually
heard on the merits, that what he did was different from
simply saying that econometrics and regression analysis
are well-established methodologies for dealing with
problems of this kind.
And I will ask you to -- to look at the top
of page 145 of the Pet. App., where you can look at
discussions -- no, I'm sorry, it's 131, in footnote
-- where the district court made clear that his
understanding of the capable class-wide proof involved
the inquiry whether the plaintiffs actually had evidence
that reflected the methodologies that had been used in
this case -- in these kinds of cases.
He says, "It is undisputed that multiple
regression analysis is an acceptable and widely
recognized statistical tool for cases of this kind."
So at a very general level, I don't have a
disagreement with you that, in many cases where there is
error, the district court started out with the right
foot. I don't agree with you that the correct standard
either was applied by the district court or was even
attempted by the court of appeals.
Now, if we were to go to the merits of the
question -- and to answer -- you know, the second part
of the question that I started out with
Justice Ginsburg -- keep in mind that, even on the
assumption that the district court accepted that there
was common class proof of antitrust impact, that is not
the same as accepting -- and I don't think the district
court accepted -- that there was common class-wide proof
that the impact for every individual was the same.
And that is a key point about what the
theory of impact here was.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't have to be the
same for every member of the class. As the dissenting
judge pointed out, you can have subclasses.
MR. ESTRADA: Well -- and I'm happy to also
deal with that question. There are cases, indeed, in
which -- you know, the variances of the classes can be
dealt with, with subclasses. No one on the plaintiffs'
side has actually asserted here that the record would
allow this. And Mr. Jordan pointed out there is
considerable basis for skepticism in thinking that that
could ever be accomplished because we are talking about
9 franchise areas with different competitive
conditions.
But if you go back to -- to the theory of
impact -- and the theory of impact was that RCN, this
putative overbuilder, was -- you know, the little engine
that could, that it was going to radiate out to the
entire DMA area and completely overbuild the area. So
the theory of impact was, if you drop a stone in the
water, you are going to have ripples all the way out, so
you have ripples as to every member of the class. It
doesn't mean that every ripple is the same.
So -- so that the key question for the
damages issue in front of you now is whether what
McClave came up with was an adequate methodology for
measuring the size of the ripple --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I did -- are there cases
in the -- in the ordinary course of class actions -- I
know they are all different -- where the district court
can find that common questions do predominate, without
addressing the question whether damages can be proven on
a class-wide basis? Or are they always interlinked?
MR. ESTRADA: No, I think the text of
(b)(20) -- of (b)(3) expressly requires that questions,
whether they be damages or liability that are common to
the class, predominate over those that are individual as
to class members. And I -- I fully accept -- and I am
not arguing -- that the mere fact that there may be
individual damages questions precludes class
certification.
I am actually arguing for the flip side of
that issue, which is that just because it -- it may not
be preclusive in certain cases doesn't mean that it is
preclusive in no case.
I would refer the Court to the Fifth
Circuit's opinion by Judge Garwood in the Bell v. AT&T
case, which was, like this, an antitrust case, where the
Fifth Circuit acknowledged that, in many of these cases,
it's almost hornbook law that there may be individual
issues that would not preclude class cert, but that
there are certain cases in which -- you know, the theory
of injury and -- and the proof that would be needed to
make it out is so sui generous and individualized --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I completely agree
with hornbook law. Three pipe manufacturers get
together and, in January, fix their prices, all right?
MR. ESTRADA: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: Fourteen wholesalers want
to show that, and each has different damages because
they bought different amounts of pipe.
MR. ESTRADA: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: Hornbook law: Certify the
class and leave the damages issues for later.
MR. ESTRADA: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: This case, this case,
hornbook law: Section 2 forbids monopolization. It is
absolutely clear Comcast has that power. That's why
they're -- that's why they're regulated. And, indeed,
they engage in things that show that they did not
achieve that through skill, foresight, and industry.
What things? And now, we have a list of
four. And the district court says exactly what? If we
prove monopolization, which is relevant to all these
people in the class, then what we do is we later look
into how much that monopolization raised the prices
above competitive levels. And I offer a model to look
at the competitive levels and look at what happened over
here, and there we are, it will help. Okay?
Now, hornbook law, whether that's so or not
so is a matter for later, but see first if there is
liability. Okay. That's their argument. What's the
answer?
MR. ESTRADA: Well, I mean, the answer is --
I will take your first example, and, in fact, I was
going to give -- you know, the example of a case that I
had that was similar where -- you know, three plastic
cup manufacturers met in -- you know, some airport and
fixed -- you know, the prices.
Now, this is like saying you fixing -- you
know, the price of widgets. There is a preexisting
but-for world, and the question as to who bought what
when is not really a question of adjudication, but of
computation. And those are the types of cases where the
courts say that the individual damages questions really
do not preclude a -- a certification.
Now, your second example may or may not be
suitable for class treatment.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, here, since what they
are saying is they have two theories, Section 1, the
agreements to keep other people out of this area are
unlawful in themselves. Question 2 is whether they
contribute to monopolization. Okay?
MR. ESTRADA: No, but -- but the question --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the legal issue
of liability. Now, if they're right, why isn't the
measure of damages just what you said? We look to the
people who are subject to the monopoly power, and we
work out how much above the competitive level they had
to pay.
MR. ESTRADA: But the legal --
JUSTICE BREYER: Some paid some; some paid
another. We have some experts in to try to make that
computation. Sounds the same to me.
MR. ESTRADA: No, but it isn't because one
key point that is missing from the hypothetical,
Justice Breyer, is exactly what the theory of liability
that is present in this case is, as the case comes to
the Court. They had four theories of possible --
JUSTICE BREYER: I saw the four theories,
and it seems to me that we are now on the theory of
the -- one of the pieces of exclusionary conduct was
agreement through various mergers, et cetera, that
potential competitors would not come in and compete.
Now, I don't know why the judge struck out
the other one, the number 2. But number 3 and Number 4,
I can see it. But on monopolization theory, that's not
relevant to damages. Throughout, we assume that the
regulator is doing a terrible job; otherwise, the prices
wouldn't be so high in the first place.
But what's the difference in this case?
just didn't hear it, and I put that to show you how it
seemed to me there is very similar. The difference --
MR. ESTRADA: No. I mean, I think -- you
know, the key point that you are missing in your
hypothetical --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is?
MR. ESTRADA: -- basically starts with the
actual point of antitrust law, whether these people
are -- actually are potential competitors. It's not
actually relevant to the class certifications that we
face today.
But I don't accept, for present purposes or
for later, that these people that already have different
clusters of cable service that were simply aggregated in
these transactions actually were actual potential
competitors. They were not --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- I mean, that's
liability.
MR. ESTRADA: Well, you are right --
JUSTICE BREYER: You have the right to prove
that they weren't, fine.
MR. ESTRADA: I just said that. But the
point is that, as the case comes to the -- to the Court,
the question is whether the class that was certified by
the district court and validated in its own way by the
court of appeals is one that is consistent and fits
reliably with the legal theory that the plaintiffs are
allowed to pursue --
JUSTICE BREYER: And this does, too --
MR. ESTRADA: -- in this case.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- because if they prove
their case, the question on damages is to what extent
did the absence of competition from the overbuilders --
and it should have been DBS too, from reading this, but
nonetheless, let me express no view on that.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: But on -- on -- to what
extent did the failure of competition from those people
raise price above the competitive level?
MR. ESTRADA: I mean, I hate --
JUSTICE BREYER: And if --
MR. ESTRADA: Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- how is it different from
the pipes --
MR. ESTRADA: -- I mean, I really hate to be
so prosaic.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, you shouldn't.
MR. ESTRADA: And you mentioned something --
something so contrary to the facts, but the fact is that
the fundamental question here is that there is one
theory they are permitted to pursue. It is that this
overbuilder, RCN, would have radiator -- radiated out
through the DMA area.
Now, you may think that they should have
been allowed to pursue some other different theory.
It's not the case that you have in front of you. And
the fact is that -- that -- that as the case comes to
the Court, the theory that remains is based on the
proposition that RCN was going to be the overbuilder
that -- that was going to impact prices. Well, two --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. --
MR. ESTRADA: If I could just finish?
Two things follow from that. You know, the
first one which is directly pertinent to the issue here
is that the McClave model purported to compute damages
that were not limited to overbuilding and that, in fact,
expressly measured overbuilding only as to 5 out of the
16 counties. The damage model just does not fit the
legal theory that stays in the case.
The second aspect of it is that, as a
question of the factual fit with the record in the case,
the transactions that added the largest number of
subscribers here occurred in 2000 and very early 2001.
The record in this case includes public announcements by
RCN, repeated by the FCC in its competition review, that
they were not going to franchise any new franchises. So
there is a basic question of lack of fit between the ipse
dixit of the expert and -- you know, the record in this case.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Estrada, as -- as the
case comes to the Court, I guess I wonder why any of
this is relevant. You mentioned earlier -- you
mentioned earlier that we reformulated the question
presented in this case. And we reformulated in a way
which said that what we wanted to talk about was whether
a district court at a class certification stage has to
conduct a Daubert inquiry, in other words, has to decide
on the admissibility of expert testimony relating to
class-wide damages.
And -- you know, it would not be crazy to
surmise that we reformulated the question because we
wanted to present -- we wanted to decide a legal
question, rather than a question about who was right as
to this particular expert's report and how strong it
was. And it turns out that, as to that legal question,
your clients waived their -- their argument that this
was inadmissible evidence.
So -- so what do we do in that circumstance?
MR. ESTRADA: Well, I don't agree with you
that we waived. And -- you know, we covered this in, I
think, three or pages in the reply brief, with all of
the citations as to how we challenged the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you challenged the
probity, Mr. Estrada. You said Comcast said it had no
objection to McClave's qualification as an expert. So
what you were talking about was the probity of this
report, not the admissibility.
MR. ESTRADA: No, that is not right, Justice
Ginsburg. Daubert and its progeny really encompasses
three distinct prongs. One of them is, of course, the
qualifications of the expert. The second one is the --
the -- the reliability of the methodology. And the
third is fit.
And all we said at the -- at the class
hearing is that we had no objection to the proposition
that these people have Ph.D.'s, which indeed they do.
But the issue still was, both in the district court and
in the court of appeals, one that we urged that the
methodology was not relevant and did not --
JUSTICE KAGAN: The district court,
Mr. Estrada, clearly understood you to be making an
argument about weight and not about admissibility. And
indeed, the district court in open court -- and -- and
it's in the transcript -- suggests that it's doing
something different from holding a Daubert hearing,
explains how it's different from holding a Daubert
hearing, and both lawyers agree to that statement.
MR. ESTRADA: Well, but I think we -- we
agree that he needed to conduct more than a Daubert
hearing because we agree with the holding of the Seventh
Circuit in American Honda, that the question at the
class cert hearing is not solely one of whether the
evidence would be admissible, but also one of -- of
whether the district judge himself is persuaded that
this is class-wide proof that has not been impeached in
his own mind.
And so -- you know, the mere fact that we
all understood that what should have been ruled on at
the class cert hearing encompassed more than pure
Daubert admissibility, is actually part of our complaint
here.
I mean, I think, if you read what the
district court did, he basically looked at his job as
looking at whether the model was capable, as in
literally capable, of -- of -- of establishing -- you
know, the facts that the plaintiffs say it establishes,
without really weighing in his own mind whether it had
been shown to be fit and -- you know, reliable.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Estrada, it seems like a
remarkable proposition, honestly, especially with a
client like yours that is well-lawyered. It seems like
a remarkable proposition that somebody -- a party can
say, we have objections about the weight of this
evidence.
We don't think -- we don't think it's a
strong expert report, and that -- and that we -- and
that the Court should then infer that there is an
objection to admissibility of evidence, as opposed,
again, to the weight and strength of evidence.
I mean, surely, a district court confronted
with an argument about the weight and strength of
evidence does not have to say, oh, I better go hold a
Daubert hearing to rule on admissibility even though
nobody's asked me --
MR. ESTRADA: But, Justice Kagan --
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- to rule on admissibility.
MR. ESTRADA: But, Justice Kagan, I mean, I
think we could go through chapter and verse to
everything that we put in the reply brief. But I think,
in fairness, I have to point out to you that we never
said that our objection was to the weight and not to the
admissibility.
We agree that these people have properly
scholarly credentials. And after that, as we say in the
reply brief with citations to the record, we said, this
model is so unreliable that it is just not usable,
period, full stop. We went to the Third Circuit and
said, this is not evidence of any kind, much less --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Did you -- did you ever file
a motion to strike the expert report?
MR. ESTRADA: No, we did not, and we
actually don't think that that's needed because it would
actually be sort of silly to engage in a motion to
strike the evidence that we are asking the district
judge to consider, in order to decide whether it
actually is reliable.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada, could you
pronounce for me or give me the legal rule as you want
us to articulate it? Let me get you out of Daubert,
okay? Because I think you really can't deny that you
never raised the word "Daubert" below until the very
end. Your fight before the district court was on the
probity of the model, not on a Daubert issue, correct?
MR. ESTRADA: I don't think that's fair
because I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you use the word
"Daubert" before the district court?
MR. ESTRADA: We cited Daubert cases in the
court of appeals. We did say to the district court that
the model was not usable.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. So you didn't use
"Daubert" below --
MR. ESTRADA: I think that's fair.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- so let's get out of
the Daubert language, okay?
Tell me how and what rule we announce, so
that district courts find an expert's evidence
probative, the other side argues it's not, and when does
the district court let the jury decide between the two?
MR. ESTRADA: There --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where is the line that
the district court draws between class certification and
merits adjudication, so that, at some point, it goes to
the jury?
MR. ESTRADA: There are two things that the
district court has to do, and both involve an assessment
of the validity or, as you would put it, probity of the
expert evidence -- you know, the first one keeps in mind
that the focus of the class certification hearing is to
decide whether the -- this case should be tried as a
class.
And therefore, the first question that the
district court has to ask is, even if I think that this
is not ready now, do they have a methodology that
sufficiently fits the facts and is reliably based on a
scientific method, so that these people will be capable
of proving class-wide this issue at trial. That's not
enough.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We must have thought that,
I suppose, or else, we wouldn't have reformulated the
question this way, right?
MR. ESTRADA: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the way you put the
question initially, and we reformulated it to be a
Daubert question.
MR. ESTRADA: I was -- I was going to point
out, by reference to one of your opinions,
Justice Scalia, that there is a question sort of based
on the Williams case, 504 U.S., as to -- you know, the
extent to which these issues are open to the Respondent
to challenge as well.
Because by the time we framed the cert
petition -- even though we framed it in terms of
Daubert, it was abundantly clear, as we pointed out in
the reply brief, that we were challenging the fit and
the reliability of the methodology. And there was nary
a word in the -- in the brief in opposition that
actually took issue with that.
On the faith of that, you reformulated the
question. Your ruling in Williams would say that that
issue is now over and that we move to the consideration
of the merits.
And I would like to reserve the remainder of
my time for rebuttal.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Barnett.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY BARNETT
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BARNETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan, you are
exactly right. The petition for certiorari was framed
not, as counsel just misspoke, in terms of Daubert, but
it was framed in terms of whether you have to go into --
whether the district court and the court of appeals have
to deal with merits issues, and that question was what
was reformulated.
And to get a sense of how profoundly
uninterested Comcast was in Daubert and in arguing
weight and probativeness, as opposed to admissibility,
which is the question before this Court, they never,
ever cited Daubert. They didn't cite it in the district
court. They didn't cite it in the court of appeals.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: One of my -- one of my
questions in the case is this: There was a question to
Mr. Estrada with reference to a jury trial. But
there's -- there's -- the judge doesn't really have a
gate -- what do you call it -- a gatekeeper function
here. There is no -- there's no jury.
And if the judge admits the evidence and if
it turns out that that doesn't meet the standard of
reliability, then he can exclude it. I don't -- I don't
see why the judge has to say, all right, now, first, I'm
going to do Daubert, and next, I'm going to do whether
this is reliable.
This is just a magic words approach, it
seems to me.
MR. BARNETT: I don't think it is a magic
word approach at all, Your Honor, because it has
tremendous significance to people who are actually
litigating the case. It's -- I submit that it is
disrespectful to a district judge not to object on
Daubert grounds and then complain that what he did was
completely unusable in the court.
They cited Daubert and Rule 702, 50 -- I
quit counting at 50, but it was only after the -- the
question was reframed not to deal with merits questions,
but to deal with Daubert specifically.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I take it there
is no argument over whether or not the expert is
qualified.
MR. BARNETT: Indeed, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The question is just
whether his -- his theory makes any sense.
MR. BARNETT: That's true.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the -- and the
Petitioner says it doesn't.
MR. BARNETT: But, Justice Kennedy, it's
also the case that the judge saying, do you have any
objections to this witness as an expert, that's about as
big an invitation you can get that, if you have got a
Daubert objection, you better make it now -- you need to
make it now.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Mr. Barnett, I -- I
can think of -- my initial reaction -- it has been an
awful long time since I have been in the courtroom --
is -- is that that's whether or not this man is -- is
qualified to give an opinion.
MR. BARNETT: That was --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Step one. The next
thing is does this opinion make any sense?
MR. BARNETT: The second step is using
the -- the Court's opinions in Daubert, as well as in
Carmichael, as well as in Joiner, which the Court has
held applies to all kinds of expert testimony in Federal
court. The district judge has an obligation to serve as
a gatekeeper, whether there is a jury in the box or not.
On a preliminary injunction, the court, if
there is a proper Daubert objection, must make the
objection at that time.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Do you
think -- that -- that's why I am trying to get away from
the magic words. Why do you disagree with the simple
proposition that a district court, by whatever magic
words it uses, has to come to the conclusion that the
expert's testimony is persuasive? And isn't that, at
bottom line, a judgment that it's reliable and
probative?
MR. BARNETT: I completely agree, Justice
Sotomayor. And we -- we embrace whatever Daubert
standard anybody wants to apply retroactively. But the
main point is Judge Padova --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are not
disagreeing with your adversary on a legal standard.
Every judge on a -- this is the simple way I formulate
the rule -- every judge before he certifies -- he or she
certifies a class, has to decide whether the methods
being used are probative and relevant, sufficient to
prove common -- common questions of damages.
MR. BARNETT: Justice Sotomayor, I agree
with that proposition if there is a proper objection
made, such that the district court is put on notice that
he or she needs to do the work.
Judge Padova had a 4-day hearing, heard a
day and a half of Dr. McClave, and then had a separate
hearing to ask specific questions about, what about,
well, there is one of the four mechanisms that the
anticompetitive conduct translated into sky high prices
throughout the Philadelphia DMA.
JUSTICE ALITO: In this case, why doesn't
the question of probative value subsume the Daubert
question?
MR. BARNETT: I don't think it does, Your
Honor. And, again, it's not magic words. Trial
lawyers -- and I have been on this case for almost 10
years now -- once you say Daubert or once you say 702 or
once you say, I object, it's not reliable, at the time,
contemporaneously, the district judge has an opportunity
to fix whatever the problem is. And the other side has
a chance to fix whatever the problem is, too.
JUSTICE ALITO: But if the problem is -- let
me ask my question in a different way. If the problem
is that the model that is being -- that was used by the
expert does not fit the theory of liability that remains
in the case, would that -- what is the difference in
determining probative value there and determining
whether it comes in under Daubert? I don't understand
MR. BARNETT: Well, it -- it certainly is
not an admissibility question. So, I mean, that's what
the question is before the Court. That is definitely
not an admissibility question. It's a question of
probativeness. And you can analyze it however you want
to under a clearly erroneous test, which is what applies
both under a Daubert standard, as well as a class
certification, where the judge is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you are saying
it's inadmissible if it's inadequately probative, right?
MR. BARNETT: It --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So the two questions boil
down to the same, don't they? If it's inadequately
probative, it's inadmissible, isn't that right.
MR. BARNETT: If -- if you are talking about
at the hearing for the class certification --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, whenever.
MR. BARNETT: -- as opposed to a trial.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about what --
what is the criterion for Daubert?
MR. BARNETT: Daubert --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it adequately probative?
If not, it's inadmissible, so.
MR. BARNETT: If it is unreliable, then it
is not admissible.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you want to say --
MR. BARNETT: It is not adequately or
inadequately --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You say unreliable. I say
inadequately probative. It's -- it is unreliable
because it is inadequately probative.
MR. BARNETT: It's -- okay, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There --
MR. BARNETT: I am not going to quibble with
you about that. But this case -- Comcast, at the heart
of this appeal, it's Comcast --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Barnett, it's always
true, isn't it, that evidence that is inadequately
probative is inadmissible?
MR. BARNETT: Is it always the case?
JUSTICE KAGAN: It's always been true,
right, if evidence is not probative?
MR. BARNETT: If there is an objection -- if
there is an objection, there is a lot of authority --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's the thing.
mean, but have we ever said that -- that without an
objection, somebody can say, look, we -- we argued about
this evidence, and that should be just good enough, even
though we didn't -- we didn't make an objection to
exclude it?
MR. BARNETT: I -- I am unaware of any time
this Court has said it's okay not to object.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are -- we are
having an elaborate discussion, and you did in -- in the
briefs, about whether or not this was a claim that was
waived below. No court has addressed that yet. We're a
court of review, not first view.
So it seems to me that one option for the
Court, since we did reformulate the question, is to
answer the question and then send it back for the court
to determine whether or not the parties adequately
preserved that option or not -- that objection or not.
MR. BARNETT: Your Honor, I agree that
that's one of the options that Your Honor has. But of
course, it goes back with all the scuffs and scars and
mess-ups that preceded it up until today.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, fine. I mean,
and the district court, presumably, can decide based on
the proceedings and all that below, all the scars and
mess-ups, whether or not it was adequately preserved or
not.
MR. BARNETT: I agree, Mr. Chief Justice.
I -- I do --
JUSTICE BREYER: The strongest argument I
think for that point of view would be simply this: The
Smith Company makes widgets. The plaintiff says they
monopolize the widget business. That business has
monopolized because they achieved the power to raise
price above the competitive level through exclusionary
practices. For example, United Fruit used to pour
garbage on the ships of its competitors.
Now, we have here a class of people who have
been injured by their monopoly power -- and here they
are, and you give a list. The judge says to the other
side, how do you know that's the right list? Well, we
know; here's how we know. We have an expert here who
has used a model to pick out the right people who were
injured by the monopoly power -- its exercise. And the
other side says, no, that model is no good.
Well, if it genuinely is no good and really
worthless, then I guess you haven't shown these are the
right people for the class. And I think that's what
they're saying. And so the response to that is, to
answer this question, do we have to go look at the
model? I mean, on its face, it seems okay. I don't
know. I haven't looked at the record. And --
MR. BARNETT: I would love to talk about the
model.
JUSTICE BREYER: Could you talk about that a
little bit, please?
MR. BARNETT: Yes, I --
JUSTICE BREYER: Did I get my analysis
right?
MR. BARNETT: I would love to talk about
this model. This --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. That isn't what I
want to really know.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: I want to know -- if you
think of the examples I just -- do you, as the
plaintiff, when you draw up your list of class members,
have to have on that list people who really were hurt by
the -- or plausibly were hurt by the exercise of market
power? And you have to have some way of picking them
out, and you have chosen this model as a way. So I
guess they could object on the ground that model is
worthless.
Is this analysis right? And you would have
to show, no, it isn't worthless.
MR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor. We do have
to show that this is a fantastic model, which it is. It
is --
JUSTICE BREYER: You don't have to show that
much. I think you only have to show it's a plausible
model.
MR. BARNETT: All right. I -- I agree.
am not going to put the -- I am happy with whatever test
you all want to apply is what I'm saying.
(Laughter.)
MR. BARNETT: This is a good model. And two
of the basic misconceptions that this case comes into
this Court with is, first, that there -- that
Dr. McClave was talking about a causal connection
between the anticompetitive conduct and the damages.
He was estimating, whatever the -- whatever
the anticompetitive conduct is, whatever the judge or
jury finds is the anticompetitive conduct that accounts
for the sky-high prices throughout the Philadelphia
area -- whatever it is, this is an accurate reflection
of the damages on a class-wide basis aggregated across
the class. The -- Comcast --
JUSTICE SCALIA: He didn't say what --
there -- there were four possibilities that he took into
account, right, as to what the anticompetitive conduct
was?
MR. BARNETT: And, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And as it turns out, only
one of those was found to -- to be in the game.
MR. BARNETT: I do want to make sure I -- I
make the connection. Dr. Williams was the one who
talked about this -- not Dr. McClave. Dr. Williams was
the one who said this is the anticompetitive conduct,
and this is what caused there to be less competition.
It was Dr. McClave's job to figure out, well, what's the
harm to the class as a result of that chain of events?
You are right, Your Honor, that --
Justice Scalia, that Judge -- Judge Padova excluded
three of the four mechanisms that Dr. Williams talked
about as having a causal connection. And it turns out
Dr. Williams --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That was the basis for the
claims.
MR. BARNETT: It was not, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It was not the basis? His
was based only on the one that the court accepted?
Where -- where in the record is -- is that?
MR. BARNETT: His -- his model was agnostic
about what the anticompetitive conduct was.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't be agnostic about
what the anticompetitive conduct is, if you are going to
do -- if you're going to do an analysis of what are the
consequences of the -- of the anticompetitive conduct,
you have to know the anticompetitive conduct you are
talking about.
MR. BARNETT: Again, I want to make sure I
am being precise about this, Justice Scalia. There is
no question that the conduct that caused the harm is the
clustering behavior that Comcast engaged in over a
decade's time.
What is not clear -- was not clear, but is
now, because Judge Padova has told us, which of the
mechanisms that Dr. Williams formulated as possible
causes of the -- the possible engines that resulted in
the prices going way up.
JUSTICE BREYER: And I guess, in a
monopolization case, it is not the case that you have to
trace the damages to the exclusionary conduct.
MR. BARNETT: Exactly.
JUSTICE BREYER: In a classical class
of -- Section 2 case, the damages are caused by the
monopolization, which lacks skill, foresight, and
industry justification. So the fact that he omitted
three, but kept one has nothing to do with damages in
a classical Section 2 case, is that right?
MR. BARNETT: Exactly right, Justice Breyer.
And maybe, if you think of it as the possibility of -- I
think of in terms of engines. There is an engine that
is causing something. Maybe it's --
JUSTICE BREYER: But here is the difficulty
that I am having, a little technical, but -- but it --
this is a regulated industry.
MR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: And because it's a
regulated industry, the regulator, in your view, is
doing one of the worst jobs in history. They are
willing to come in and overbuild and everything, so he
must be letting prices -- all right. Suppose the judge
or lawyer were to find, that's okay, it doesn't matter,
all we're interested in is what Justice Scalia says.
Then, if that were true, from looking at the
footnote on this, I guess you'd take this model, and you
would simply subtract or add to the base, which is
supposed to be the competitively priced districts.
MR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: The districts that also
have satellite.
MR. BARNETT: Indeed.
JUSTICE BREYER: And that shouldn't be tough
to do, but I don't know if it's tough to do, and I don't
see how we're ever going to find out.
MR. BARNETT: The record says it can be
done. In fact --
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. How would
you answer such a question?
MR. BARNETT: I would -- would cite you
to -- let's see if I can find it.
It's in -- actually in the court of appeals
record AO 01533 through 34, it is stated there that you
can take off of the DBS -- if you don't like the DBS
penetration screen, then you can turn it off, and
damages are still, as we have established since -- when
Comcast -- when they finally did file a Daubert motion,
would be something like $550 million on a class-wide
basis.
So that is in the record, as well as there
is ample evidence, Exhibit 82, which shows 23 different
iterations of the damages models, including damages
models that Dr. Chipty on the Comcast side put together,
slicing and dicing all of this data to show that, no
matter how you slice it and dice it, almost, if you did
it in any kind of a fair way that the Federal Judicial
Center recognizes as a reliable type of methodology, you
are going to have significant damages across the class
for each class member throughout the time period.
The other thing I would like --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Barnett -- I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
MR. BARNETT: No, Your Honor. I was about
to change that subject.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Then I will.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN: I am still in search of a
legal question that anybody disagrees about here.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN: You know, I read before the
district court statement of the standard, now all points
of the circuit court statement of the standard, where
the circuit court says, "The inquiry for a district
court at the class certification stage is whether the
plaintiffs have demonstrated" -- burden is on you -- "by
a preponderance of the evidence that they will be able
to measure damages on a class-wide basis using common
proof."
The parties both agree with that statement
of the standard. It seems to me that the parties also
both agree -- and this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's
question -- that if the Daubert question had not been
waived, that if -- if Comcast had objected to the
admissibility of this expert report, that, indeed, the
court would -- should have held a hearing on the
admissibility of the expert report.
So this is a case where it seems to me that,
except for the question of how good the expert report
is, none of the parties have any adversarial difference
as to the appropriate legal standard. And -- you know,
usually, we decide cases based on disagreements about
law. And here, I can't find one.
Is there any? Do you disagree with
Mr. Estrada on any statement of the legal standard?
MR. BARNETT: I -- I do not, Your Honor, and
I think Justice -- Judge Padova got it exactly right.
You read the -- the standard that he applied. In fact,
if anything, it's a tougher standard than should be the
test. But we're -- we embrace that test and we are
happy about it, and we don't disagree with Mr. Estrada.
And this is what I was about to change
subject to a little bit, the two misconceptions that
fundamentally affect Comcast's view of the world --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, before you do that,
let me ask a question related to what Justice Kagan just
asked. If we were to answer the question presented as
reformulated, I take it your answer would be that a
district court under those circumstances may not certify
a class action; is that right?
MR. BARNETT: If there is a proper
objection, properly and timely presented, it's preserved
up through the appellate courts and all the things that
you need to do in order to be fair to the judge, as well
as make sure you get it -- give it as good a chance to
be right as possible, the answer would be yes. But
that's a lot of caveats before you get --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, then the only
remaining question is whether the issue was in the case
as a factual -- as a matter of the record here; isn't
that right?
MR. BARNETT: Well, if the issue of
admissibility is in the case, I don't think it is. If
evidence comes in -- again, this is -- this was not a
bunch of expert reports that were just piled up on
the -- in chambers, and Judge Padova went through them.
He actually, at their request, had a four-day hearing,
and then a fifth day, where he posed a series -- I think
it was a four-page letter where the judge says, I'm
concerned about this, I'm concerned about that, y'all
come back and tell me why it's okay.
And what --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could this report be
probative if it did not satisfy Daubert?
MR. BARNETT: The answer, Your Honor -- and
my source is Section 274 of Trial and Corpus Juris
Secundum, well-recognized in this Court, no doubt. It
says that, if it's in the record, if it comes in
unobjected to, it has whatever probative value the
court -- the trier-of-fact chooses to place on it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That the court as the
trier-of-fact chooses to -- that the -- not reserved to
cases where there's a jury? Is that --
MR. BARNETT: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that, as I
indicated before, that the whole question of weight and
admissibility is somewhat less important when the trial
judge is not the gatekeeper. The trial judge, at the
end of the day, can hear the testimony and say, you
know, I admitted this testimony, but it doesn't make any
sense, it doesn't work.
MR. BARNETT: What's happening, Your Honor,
is you have got to satisfy -- Rule 23(b)(3) says the
judge has to make findings. That's one of the few
parts of Rule 23 that talks about findings.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he does what I said,
but then he has 100 pages of findings.
MR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor. But he's --
he's acting as a gatekeeper, and what he's doing -- or
she's doing is projecting, what's this trial going to
look like, based on the evidence in front of me?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I think that's where
we disagree. The judge has to make a determination
that, in his view, the -- the class can be certified.
MR. BARNETT: Absolutely. He does. And
if --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that includes some
factual inquiries as -- as to the damages alleged and
the cause of the injury and whether or not there is a
common -- whether or not there's a commonality.
MR. BARNETT: The -- Justice Kennedy, the
district judge asks, prove to me -- to the plaintiff,
that you can prove it at trial, prove to me now that, at
trial, you will be able to submit a damages model that
passes muster, under Daubert or whatever test there is,
depending on what the objections are.
So the judge is acting in a gatekeeper role,
right then, kind of projecting into the future about
what am I going to do when the jury's in the box --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's not -- I'll
think about it, but that's not my understanding. I
thought the judge has to make a determination that, in
the next case we are going to hear this morning, that
the representation is material or it affects the market.
The judge has to make that conclusion, make that
finding.
MR. BARNETT: And the finding that the judge
makes, based on preponderance of the evidence,
plaintiffs have shown to me that, more likely than not,
at trial, plaintiffs will be able to show, on a
class-wide basis, some evidence, enough to get a verdict
that could be upheld, enough that satisfies to some
evidence or whatever the test is at trial, that shows
damages on a class-wide basis.
So the judge isn't saying, this is it, you
can't fix it, you can't change it, you can't modify it,
you can't enhance it between now and trial. He says
that you can do it. You have shown to me -- to my
satisfaction, that, more likely than not, that the
evidence that you will present to the jury at trial is
going to be admissible, and it's going to be
sufficiently persuasive if the jury chooses to accept
And this is where -- I really want to get to
this about the merits. This -- I think there is a great
deal of confusion about what Judge Aldisert meant in the
Third Circuit when he talked about the merits.
Comcast, each time construes, when he uses
the word "merits," talk about incantation of magic
words, that that means whether it's good or bad, that
that is what Judge Aldisert was talking about. That is
not what he was talking about at all. He was talking
about trial on the merits. He was saying that, right
now, we don't have to decide whether this model is
perfect. It's enough.
The test -- this issue isn't before us
because it's been waived, Daubert and all that, but if
you want to know what our observation would be, if this
were presented in a proper case, then observation is it
doesn't have to be perfect, and it can be enhanced
between now -- which is supposed to happen at an early,
practicable time -- and trial, so that the jury can see
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, tell me -- you
articulate for me what you think -- what the district
court found when it accepted your expert's theory as
adequate.
MR. BARNETT: What Judge --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you think that
means, legally?
MR. BARNETT: What Judge Padova found was
that the McClave damages model is persuasive to him --
sufficiently persuasive to him, that it could be used at
trial to prove damages on a class-wide basis.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what does
"sufficiently persuasive" mean?
MR. BARNETT: That more likely than not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It sounds nice, but more
likely than not --
MR. BARNETT: More likely than not that it
will be admissible at trial, and it will meet the
standard that's required to get to a verdict. Not that
it's I'm convinced that you're right. And that's what
Judge Aldisert was talking about.
He said, it's not time for us to say Comcast
wins or plaintiffs win, based on all this evidence. The
only thing that's really before the court is whether,
more likely than not, the plaintiffs have presented a
model -- we're talking about a model in this case. It
could be a different issue in a different case. In the
the Amgen case that's coming up, it could be a different
issue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Barnett, this is on a
different issue, but you had originally suggested that
you had -- that the motion -- that the settlement that's
looming was a reason that this Court ought not to decide
this case. But do you now agree that, given the
district court's denial of your motion to enforce the
settlement, that the proposed settlement has no bearing
on this Court's consideration of the case?
MR. BARNETT: At this time, Your Honor, I
think -- I think it has no bearing on what this Court
does or does not do in this case. It is something that
we would have the right to appeal at an appropriate
time, but we're not doing that now.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, it -- it
seems to me that your answer to Justice Sotomayor, which
is whether it's more likely than not that this will be
something that can be used at trial, one way to capture
that is whether or not this evidence is usable, right?
MR. BARNETT: I would not say that. And
partly --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: More likely than not
whether it can be used at trial, that sounds like, is it
usable?
MR. BARNETT: Well, the reason I'm
hesitating is because --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know the
reason you're hesitating.
(Laughter.)
MR. BARNETT: Well -- and also, it's because
it's something you don't know. When that word was used,
"unusable," in court, they were talking about common
impact. That's what that was about. That was what that
discussion was about. It wasn't about this model.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, there
matters for the trier of fact to determine at the merits
stage, but under -- under Daubert and under Rule 702,
the judge has to say that the evidence is relevant to
the task at hand, and it has a reliable foundation.
can see a judge saying, well, now, this theory that
you're using, this theory works, I think it's accepted
in academia. Then he hears all the testimony, and he
says, It just doesn't work here.
MR. BARNETT: And Judge Padova could have
done that, but he didn't do that. I think he was
persuaded by the evidence that Dr. McClave put on, and
he rejected -- because we know from his 81-page opinion
that he rejected an awful lot of what Comcast's experts
said.
So he -- he could have made that
determination. And this is why it's an -- if we're
talking -- if we're not dealing just with an
admissibility issue that's been forfeited away, we're
dealing with abuse of discretion and clearly erroneous.
And this is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm not sure what I
just described is not Daubert.
MR. BARNETT: Your Honor, if you're in a
trial court and somebody says Daubert or somebody says
Rule 702 or somebody says I object to this expert's
testimony, that has profound significance. And, again,
I think it's -- it's almost disrespectful to the
district court to say, it's okay, although this -- this
question wasn't on the test that you had when you were
trying to decide the case, we're going to add the
question to the test, and by the way, you flunked it.
That's not fair.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the bottom line
is can a district court ever say that it's persuaded by
unreliable or not probative evidence. That's really the
bottom line question.
MR. BARNETT: I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it commit legal
error when it finds something that's unreliable and
unpersuasive -- or unprobative?
MR. BARNETT: Well, Your Honor, I agree.
And of course, that's not the issue in the case because
Judge Padova was convinced it was reliable. And there's
plenty of proof that there was.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I think that's a
fair reading of what he said --
MR. BARNETT: Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but if we're
answering a legal question.
MR. BARNETT: We're talking about the -- the
edges and all the -- where everything is done properly
below. If it doesn't pass muster under Daubert --
whatever the test is, let's not reformulate it here -- I
suppose, yes, then it's not admissible.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem everyone's
having is -- I think -- that why do you need Daubert to
point out that something is not probative or unreliable?
Why -- whether it's an expert or a lay witness
testifying, wouldn't you apply that same standard to
anybody's testimony?
MR. BARNETT: Justice Sotomayor, let me --
let me just give you an example. There were a bunch of
issues that the dissenting judge raised, including the
overbuilding screen, a particular kind of market screen,
mathematical averages. If -- in the DBS penetration
screen, if he had raised any of those, if there had been
a whisper of a hint of a suggestion, of a thought, of
those things in the district court, we'd have been
all over that. And we would have proved that it was
false, that those -- that those statements are untrue.
And we know that's accurate because, as I
just read to you from the -- the court of appeals
record, the DBS screen can, in fact, be taken off,
eliminated from the sample, and you still have
$550 million worth of damages on a class-wide basis.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. --
MR. BARNETT: And the reason we got to that
is because they finally did when -- on the eve of trial,
file an actual Daubert motion, and that was our
response. And they cited footnote 323 of their brief.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Barnett, suppose --
suppose we held that where -- where there's a bench
trial, it doesn't make any difference what -- what --
whether the judge excludes the evidence under Daubert --
I never know how to say it. Is it Daubert or Daubert?
(Laughter.)
MR. BARNETT: It depends on the time of day,
Your Honor.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I think you're right.
It doesn't make a dime's worth of difference whether the
judge excludes it under -- under Daubert or proceeds to
find it simply unreliable -- unreliable. Suppose --
suppose we held that. What -- what difference would it
make in the world?
MR. BARNETT: I would --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So the trial judge could
say, yes, I have a Daubert motion, but -- but I'm going
to defer that. I'm just going to -- going to proceed to
see whether this evidence is reliable.
MR. BARNETT: Justice Scalia, I would say
what you're doing is what I suggest the Court ought to
do. Everybody knows that district judges have broad
discretion in a lot of different things that they do.
You just made it this much bigger as a result of saying,
we're not even going to bother with the Daubert thing,
we're going to trust that the district judge is not
going to be persuaded by phony evidence, and we're going
to trust-- if he gets it nearly close, right, that he
got it right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Estrada, you have five minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Let me -- let me start with the proposition
which I continue to find startling, that a damages model
can stand up to examination on the theory that it is not
linked to any theory of anticompetitive conduct. Now,
the theory seems to be that what the McClave model is
intended to do is to isolate competitive markets
elsewhere that are competitive in some sense, come to
the conclusion that the Philadelphia DMA is somehow less
competitive, and charge whatever the expert says is the
difference to Comcast.
But that has a fundamental failure, as a
matter of substantive antitrust law, because we know
from cases from this Court and the court of appeals
going back to Story Parchment, that the one requirement
is that causation link of the damages -- you know, it
has to be certainly linked to illegal conduct.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? Is that
what Learned Hand said? Is -- is that what Alcoa holds?
Is that United Fruit holds when they bomb their
competitor's ship and achieve monopolization? That the
only people who can get damages are the people who run
the ship and were bombed --
MR. ESTRADA: No, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- who bought those
bananas? I didn't know that. But besides, if you're
right, which I tend to doubt, but I'll look it up, if
you're right --
MR. ESTRADA: Story Parchment.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right. Fine.
I'll look that up. If you're right and as they pointed
out, it's still one of the easiest things in the world
to simply change the base for this model. Instead of
the base being those businesses or homeowners who
received their service at competitive prices, we say --
we modify it by including those who received services
where DBS was involved, and that'll be a higher price,
and we subtract that price from the price they paid
where there was overbuilding threatened.
Now, that'll be a new number. They say it
was a new number. And I think anybody running a model
could do that, but I promise you, I don't know. And to
know whether you're right on that, or they're right, I
will have to get into the model-building business, where
I am not an expert.
MR. ESTRADA: Well, no. I think all you
have to do is whether the proponent -- is to ask whether
the proponent of class certification has discharged his
duty under this Court's cases, to come forward with
evidence that is persuasive under the point whether the
case as a whole can be tried as a class. You don't have
to become an econometrician. You have to know enough to
assess whether the record that has been proffered is
probative on the question before the Court.
Here, it isn't. And one of the reasons it
isn't is because they came to the hearing in class
certification in the fall of 2009 after full merits
discovery. The papers -- we said to them, we have full
merits discovery, this model does not work. We had
variants of not usable. Every word -- I can read it
all, Justice Kagan, if it's worth taking the time. You
know, the flaws preclude its use, it's not to be
accepted, it's not usable, it does not result in a valid
methodology that can be used.
And so, having said all of that, we said,
this model is bunk. You have full class merits
discovery. You have plenty of opportunity to come up
with a better model. Nothing.
We go to the court of appeals. It is
affirmed. Then it goes back to the -- to the district
court for further trial proceedings. The district
court, having read the court of appeals' opinion,
invites them to submit the evolutionary model that the
court of appeals had in mind. Nothing. We are still
sticking with our story, McClave's the guy.
And so they have had every conceivable
opportunity to develop a model. Why haven't they done
that, Justice Breyer? Oh, maybe because there is a
problem in the record. You can take all of the maps in
the record, which are part of the field supplemental
appendix, and you can see the different areas of
penetration for DBS -- you know, has different rates of
penetration all over the class area.
Same thing for RCN and FiOS. And you can
look at what -- what the market penetration is in each
franchise area. Consider that each of them is a
different licensing authority, that the overbuilding
would have to go to franchise by franchise and radiate
out in the fullness of time. And I don't know if there
is an econometrician that can combine all of that into a
single class or subclasses.
They haven't identified one. And the key
point for the resolution of the case in front of you,
Justice Kagan, is that the question that comes here is
whether a class that is more expansive than the one that
you -- that you certified in Wal-Mart can possibly be
certified where there is no evidence that is tied to the
record in the case that is reliably probative that a
class would exist.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
