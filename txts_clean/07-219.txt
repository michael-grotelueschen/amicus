CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
this morning in Case 07-219, Exxon Shipping Company
versus Baker, et al.
Mr. Dellinger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. DELLINGER: Good morning, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
When the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince
William Sound on March 24, 1989, the resulting spill of
million gallons of oil was one of the worst
environmental tragedies in U.S. maritime history.
The only remaining aspect -- the only aspect
of the litigation over the Valdez disaster that is
before the Court today concerns almost entirely lost
revenues by the commercial fishing industry. Exxon long
ago paid $400 million in compensation for that lost
revenue. At issue here is whether an additional warrant
to the commercial fishing class of $2.5 billion dollars
in punitive damages is permissible under Federal
Maritime Law.
The first of the three reasons that the
decision below should be reversed is that the Ninth
Circuit erred in overturning a maritime law rule that
has been settled for 200 years. Although a shipowner
is, of course, liable to fully compensate for all of the
damages caused by the wrongful acts of a captain in
compensation, it is liable for punitive damages under
the long-settled rule only if the shipowner directed,
ratified, or participated in the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger, how was
that rule settled? You go in that story and The Amiable
Nancy, but no one even raised the question of punitive
or exemplary damages in those cases. So what is the
long-settled line of decisions of this Court in maritime
law that you are relying on?
MR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, The
Amiable Nancy is the only maritime case, but this Court
in Lake Shore in 1893 --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was on land on the
railroad.
MR. DELLINGER: Yes, but this Court's
unanimous opinion by Justice Gray in Lake Shore cites
with approval The Amiable Nancy decision and the
maritime context. Three times this Court has considered
the question of whether there should be respondeat
superior liability in punitive damages for the wrongful
action.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are talking about
maritime law, and relying on The Amiable Nancy. And my
only point is that was not raised, argued, or decided.
So it's rather, I think, an exaggeration to call it a
long line of settled decisions in maritime law.
MR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, the issue
has been so well settled, and Courts of Appeals have so
long recognized, that punitive damages are not available
in vicarious liability in maritime cases that the issue,
understandably, doesn't -- doesn't come up. It's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And we thought so in
Prentice.
MR. DELLINGER: Yes. In Lake Shore versus
Prentice, this Court did in 1818 and 1893 and 1999
address this question, once in the maritime context,
once in the context of Federal common law, and once in
the particular statutory context of --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the Lake Shore
case, if I remember right, did not involve a managerial
employee. It involved a conductor on a train.
MR. DELLINGER: That's -- that's correct.
But it -- but the rule is clear from Lake Shore versus
Prentice that it is the same rule as The Amiable Nancy
rule. There is not respondeat superior liability in the
absence of some action on the part of the shipowner.
Now, the reason --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the shipowner is,
I suppose, the owner of Exxon or the hundreds of
thousands of shareholders, right? So you have to have a
shareholder driving the boat before you can assess
liability?
MR. DELLINGER: No. The company acts
through its policymaking officers or through its
policies; so that if a reckless judgment is made by
someone who had authority to set policy for the company,
either the president of Exxon Shipping -- I mean if the
Plaintiffs were correct that the jury actually,
necessarily --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not quite
correct to say only the owner. In other words, it is a
certain level of employee, because corporations only act
through individuals. It is a certain level of employee
in the company.
Now, where do you draw the line between the
CEO and the cabin boy? How do you do that? And I would
suspect, just instinctively, that somebody driving one
of these huge tankers is a lot closer to the CEO than
the cabin boy.
MR. DELLINGER: The one thing that,
traditionally, if you look at all the Courts of Appeals
cases and all of the tradition and maritime law, is that
the captain or the pilot, anyone on board the ship, does
not implicate in punitive damages the company, or the
shipowner.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean the captain --
MR. DELLINGER: -- or the ship owner.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is not a managerial
officer for any purpose? Suppose he decides that he's
going to leave despite an adverse weather report? Is he
not a managerial agent at least for that?
MR. DELLINGER: I think the tradition is
clear, Justice Kennedy, that if it's a -- that the
maritime tradition is that, while you are liable for all
of the harms caused by that, the decisions made on the
ship do not implicate in punitive damages.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm asking
about the concept of the managerial officer in general.
And I think that we can explore in this argument,
whether or not The Amiable Nancy held very squarely
about punitive damages, whether we ought to do so in the
first instance.
MR. DELLINGER: That is correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me a large
part of that inquiry turns on what a managerial officer
is and what -- was Hazelwood not a managerial officer
for any purpose at all?
MR. DELLINGER: You know, I can't rule out
the possibility that someone in that position might be,
but he did not set company policy.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that you're
talking about a different level. I think we ought to be
clear on this. I thought it was conceded that Hazelwood
was, indeed, a "managerial agent" as that term is used
in the Restatement of Torts, right?
So you are talking about it's not good
enough that you are managerial agent; you have to be in
a higher echelon in the company. That's your position?
MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. There has
-- one has to be someone with authority to set relevant
policy who has some responsibility over that area of the
company's operations that would not --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why should that be? I
mean, why should there be a different rule? Let's
assume -- I mean I'll assume for the sake of argument
that The Amiable Nancy does not settle the issue
absolutely.
Why, then, should the -- and it doesn't, it
seems to me, settle this distinction at all. So why
should there be a distinction between corporations
generally and maritime corporations?
MR. DELLINGER: Well, there are two
responses to that question.
The first is that there is -- this has
worked in the context of maritime law for 200 years, and
-- and because of the -- there has been a long tradition
of needing to foster and promote maritime commerce, and
the fact that it's thought to be particularly risky and
dangerous to conduct maritime commerce. But --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't part
of the reason, at least for the assumption that there's
a distinction, something that I think was mentioned in
The Amiable Nancy? And that is in those days, when a
ship put to sea, the ship was sort of a floating world
by itself. And the -- the contact with the shipowner
was simply gone until the thing came back into port
again.
That is certainly not the case today, and we
know it's not the case in the circumstances here.
So if the -- if the relationship to the
corporation, to the CEO, if you will, and the captain of
a vessel is not in any way different from the
relationship of the CEO and, say, a division chief of a
corporation, I don't see why that distinction should
hold today.
MR. DELLINGER: There is no question,
Justice Souter, but that communications have -- have
improved. There is a -- there is much of the tradition
of maritime law that still obtains. Maritime commerce,
because it takes place on the high seas, is an
inherently and continuously more risky endeavor than
most other occupations, but --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That may be an argument for
no punitive damages, but I don't see why it's an
argument for distinguishing between maritime
corporations and others. I mean, other -- other kinds
of enterprises have a lot of risk in them, too. And I'm
missing the distinction there.
MR. DELLINGER: Well, to the extent that one
doesn't see that the tradition of -- of what's worked in
maritime law in its own system of law for 200 years
should be different, it is not at all clear why the
maritime law rule ought not be the rule on land. There
are eight States --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I had not understood
you to concede that -- that the land rule was different
from the maritime rule. I gather that in many States
it's the same as what you assert the maritime rule to
MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. And it is
the rule that this Court adopted in Lake Shore versus
Prentice, and it is -- it is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Which was a land case.
MR. DELLINGER: And the policy behind it --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But you are right, and I
want to make -- let me just make clear one other point.
You are drawing a distinction, as I understood you to
say to Justice Ginsburg, between the Restatement
position and your position.
MR. DELLINGER: That is correct --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. DELLINGER: -- although there are some
States that have the Restatement position that may read
"managerial employee" in the way that maritime law does,
and that is a person who is in a position to set
relevant policy for the company and not just the branch
manager at a -- at a Wal-Mart.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there aren't many
States that follow the Restatement position.
MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. And -- but
my point is not that -- my point is simply that there
are good reasons for the maritime law rule, and they
have been accepted in other cases.
When Justice Gray embraced that rule in the
Lake Shore case, he did so because he thought it
inappropriate to impose punitive elements on someone who
was not actually the wrongdoer. And when Justice
O'Connor wrote in Kolstad, she spoke of the important
principle underlying common law limitations on vicarious
liability for punitive damages.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right, Mr.
Dellinger, that in the railroad case the court was
dealing with the concept of respondeat superior? It
didn't make any distinction between regular employees
and managerial employees, and, indeed, it was not
dealing with a managerial employee.
MR. DELLINGER: It was dealing with someone
who was at the level of a conductor, I think, exactly on
par with the captain.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I don't recall that
they made anything about managerial. They were just
talking about respondeat superior at large, I thought.
MR. DELLINGER: Yes. Now, I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I don't think the
conductor is on a par with a captain. The captain has
this huge vessel. He can decide when it leaves. He
decides the course. And I think that "managerial
officer" might be a divisible concept.
Obviously, he doesn't bind Exxon for filing
its tax returns or to decide whether there's a
deduction. But you are saying he binds Exxon for no
purpose at all, ever.
MR. DELLINGER: For punitive damages. Of
course, they are bound to pay for all of the harm
caused. But that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, we are talking
about punitive damages but at the concept of a
"managerial officer." And I haven't heard why he isn't
a managerial officer at least as to some things.
MR. DELLINGER: Well, for two reasons:
One, he was unable to set policy for any of
these issues. And think of the larger context. The
reason we want to hold someone, an entity or a person,
liable in punitive damages is because they make a
decision that is malicious or profit-seeking, or
whatever.
When you are advancing the policies of the
company and are empowered to advance those policies, and
you do so in a way that is either malicious or driven by
profit motives or hope to conceal it, when all of those
things happen, it is appropriate to visit upon those
persons the extra punishment of punitive damages.
And that's why it's not the importance of
the job. It's the fact that when someone acts contrary
to the interest -- contrary to the interest of a company
and its shareholders, why in that instance should
--
someone who is not advancing the company's interests,
not authorized to make policy, do so?
So if the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question,
Mr. Dellinger?
MR. DELLINGER: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: In some punitive-damages
cases, the liability attaches because the person has
hired someone who is obviously incompetent.
Supposing that the -- a crew member was --
an obviously incompetent crew member was hired by the
captain of the ship. Would that be sufficient to
justify punitive damages?
MR. DELLINGER: Not against the company that
owned the ship. Only if someone --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And if he was hired by a
shore-based personnel, then, would that be the
difference for you?
MR. DELLINGER: The -- only if the company
at a policymaking level is implicated would the company
JUSTICE STEVENS: The one -- the company
says the captain hires the crew members who could cause
all sorts of damage. And another company says somebody
on shore can do it. You have a different rule between
those two?
MR. DELLINGER: Oh, well, I think if the
case arises in a maritime context, there would not be --
there would not be a different rule, whether a decision
was made on shore or not. If you are talking about a
maritime law case --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would there be vicarious
liability or not in the case: Negligence in hiring an
incompetent crew member?
MR. DELLINGER: Not unless the decision was
made by someone at a policymaking level.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he has the authority
to decide who to hire. Is that policymaking?
MR. DELLINGER: No. That's the
implementation of -- that's the implementation of a
policy. So I think what -- if you keep in mind the
purposes of punitive damages, as to whether conduct
should be deterred and whether it should be punished,
and when you are talking about going against the
shareholders of the company, not -- of course, they have
to pay for all the compensatory harms. We don't doubt
that.
But for punishment the notion is that it is
the -- that-- that at least eight States have and it is
in the maritime law rule that you need to show that
there is -- that there is --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Recklessness in hiring the
employee who caused the damage can be a --
MR. DELLINGER: Yes, absolutely. We have
not disputed the fact that if the jury actually did have
to conclude that Exxon was reckless in the supervision
or the hiring or the placement of Hazelwood, that that
would be a grounds for imputing punitive-damages
liability.
JUSTICE STEVENS: In hiring the third mate
here, if he was negligently hired by somebody on shore,
there would be liability? But if he was negligently
hired by the captain, there would be no liability?
MR. DELLINGER: No. I think it has to do
with the level at which the -- at which the hiring
decision was made. It has to be a decision -- and I
think the way the case was tried it makes sense that if
senior officials for Exxon were informed and if the jury
decided on the basis that at a high level at Exxon
Shipping that they knew that this person was -- should
not be put in command of a ship, and, nonetheless, it
did so, that would implicate them. If I could --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was -- there was
sufficient evidence of that. I mean --
MR. DELLINGER: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The jury could have found
that Exxon knew that this captain had a severe alcohol
problem; and, yet, they let him stay on voyage after
voyage and did nothing about it.
So the jury could have found: Never mind
the captain. Exxon, itself, is a grave wrongdoer
because it allowed the tanker to be operated by a
captain who was certainly not fit.
MR. DELLINGER: Yes, and I want to be clear
about that. The answer to that question is: Yes, the
jury could have found that Exxon was reckless in
allowing Hazelwood to command the ship and that that
recklessness would implicate the company for punitive
damages.
But they need not have done so. They need
not even have reached the issue, and the court of
appeals said -- it is at page 88 and 89. The Ninth
Circuit said that the jury could also, in the
alternative, have found that Exxon followed a reasonable
policy of fostering reporting and treatment by alcohol
abusers, knew that Hazelwood had obtained treatment, and
did not know that he was taking command of the
ship drunk.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a jury question.
There was evidence both ways. So, on this issue, am I
right in thinking that if you succeed, all you can get
is a new trial?
MR. DELLINGER: That is correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And, I take it, next time
around the jury would get a special verdict and be
asked: Was Exxon, itself, reckless in allowing this
captain to stay on the ship?
MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. That is
correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is only true if
you lose on your second and third questions as well,
right?
MR. DELLINGER: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The answers to your
second and third questions preclude a new trial?
MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. And that's
actually a recent --
JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to get --
looking at this case of Lake Shore, as I read -- as I
read that case, I'm thinking that they looked back to
the admiralty case, but they're saying this isn't an
admiralty rule. It's a Federal rule. And the Federal
rule is that to make the corporation liable for
punitives in the absence of bad conduct by anyone in the
corporation but for the lower executive, you can't do
But if it were a higher executive, the
president and general manager or, in his absence, the
vice president in his place, then you could.
So they are distinguishing among levels of
corporate officials. Now that seems to be the Federal
rule, right?
MR. DELLINGER: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what
happens to that Federal rule? One thing we know
happened to it is that time passed; Erie v. Thompkins
came along; and most of the relevant cases left the
Federal courts or Federal law and were decided under
State law.
Was there anything left in the Federal
system besides admiralty where this Federal rule might
apply; and, if so, what happened to it?
MR. DELLINGER: The only place it would
remain is in statutory settings where the court has to
supply the answer to a question of whether punitive
damages are an available remedy in a Title VII case.
And that's -- that's the only --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what happened? And
the reason I think I'd like to know is because it seems
to me it makes a difference from the point of view of
stare decisis whether the Federal rule, as Federal rule,
has always stayed the same or the Federal rule has
eroded so that in place X and Y it disappears, remaining
only in admirality, in which case you have a genuine
outlier.
And I don't know what the history is.
MR. DELLINGER: Well, the -- of course, with
the -- with the replacement of the Arrowsmith versus
Tyson by Erie against Thompkins, it was no longer a
broad area.
JUSTICE BREYER: I know. That's beside the
point to my question.
MR. DELLINGER: In the lower courts the rule
has continued as a maritime rule law. It has worked
within the context of a maritime law rule. Maritime is
its own system of law. The fact that West Virginia --
West Virginia has a different law than this Court's
maritime law --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just interrupt. To
what extent is present maritime law informed by State
common law throughout the country?
MR. DELLINGER: It is in the absence of a --
in the absence of a Federal rule, but here the -- there
are -- there's not uniformity among the States.
To turn to the second question of whether --
which would actually preclude the need even to resolve
The Amiable Nancy issue as to whether there should be as
a matter of judge-made maritime law a punitive-damages
remedy for unintentional oil spills. Now, the starting
point to think about that, I believe, is this Court's
decision in Milwaukee versus Illinois in 1981.
This is the standard the Court set: Federal
courts create common law only as a necessary expedient
when problems requiring Federal answers are not
addressed by Federal statutory law. That precisely
describes this case.
The Court looking out --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the City of
Milwaukee involved the displacement by Federal statutory
law of Federal common law. Your case involves the
displacement of Federal maritime law by Federal
statutory law.
Federal maritime law is routine. Federal
courts do that all the time. Federal common law is
unusual, and in the City of Milwaukee was resorted to
simply by necessity.
Doesn't that suggest that whatever the
Federal maritime rule on punitive damages is, it's a
harder showing on your part to conclude that it's
displaced by the statutory process?
MR. DELLINGER: Well, the reason I think
that's not -- not the case is twofold.
First of all, the era in which this Court
created lots of admiralty law has receded itself because
Congress has become active, and then there's no longer
a -- as necessary, a role for this Court.
Justice O'Connor, for example, said that in
-- that we sail -- the courts sail -- now sail in
occupied waters in making maritime law because of the
amount of Federal statutory law.
And, secondly, the assumption that there was
a well developed punitive damages remedy in maritime
law, and that we have a harder road to show that the
existence of a series of Federal statutes eliminates the
need for that, is just not established.
This Court itself has never affirmed an
award of punitive damages under maritime law. It has
never held that punitive damages are available for
unintentional conduct in maritime law. It has never
held that they were available for oil spills.
There were only four cases of Federal
maritime punitive damage awards in the history of the
country before the Clean Water Act was passed.
Professor Robinson finds eight more cases that don't use
the term "punitive damages" or "exemplary," or anything
else; but, at most, that would be 12. We think the
answer is four.
So that -- and, in fact, the largest award
ever -- ever made was for $500,000. So there was no --
and that was after the Clean Water Act. So there's no
established tradition of -- of punitive damages.
This Court would be making a major step to
affirm an award, to play a role, in an unintentional
case of punitive damages in maritime law for oil spills.
Because what Congress has done here is to obviate the
need for a remedy by passing a comprehensive and
carefully calibrated statute.
But the hallmark of the Clean Water Act is
the obvious effort to balance --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Dellinger,
before we get into the merits of that issue, the Clean
Water Act did not enter this case until 13 months after
the jury verdict. And the trial court, who had very
carefully managed this case -- and it was a humongous
case -- would never list it as an issue in the case.
And so he said: I won't hear it 13 months after the
verdict.
Why shouldn't we instruct the court of
appeals that when a district judge does a diligent job
like that one did to try to get at all the issues --
says you're too late; you can't come in 13 months after
the verdict and argue a point of law that would have
overtaken the verdict, because essentially you're asking
for judgment as a matter of law on this issue.
MR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, that sort
of concern has much more force if you are talking about
issues that go to the substantiality of the evidence.
But here the court of appeals --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. Well, what did you
make -- you made a motion to bring up the Clean Water
Act as dispositive on punitive damages, and you made
that motion 13 months after the jury verdict.
MR. DELLINGER: Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is the basis in
the Federal rules for that motion?
MR. DELLINGER: The motion was made before
the entry of judgment.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: 13 months after the
verdict.
MR. DELLINGER: That -- the motion was
not on -- on -- the court of appeals held -- not only
did the court of appeals press -- not only was the issue
pressed and passed upon by the court of appeals, the
court of appeals held that the district court was wrong
in assuming that it was waived. The district court was
told by the plaintiffs that this was the same motion --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I -- that's not my
question. My question is: Under what Federal rules did
you move to bring up this issue 13 months after the
verdict?
MR. DELLINGER: It was under rule 59, under
rule 49.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: 49 is on special
verdicts. What did this have to do with special
verdicts?
MR. DELLINGER: I'm sorry. It was a rule 50
-- it was a rule 50 motion. It was not untimely, and
the court of appeals --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Rule 50 is pretty strict,
isn't it? I mean, rule 50 -- if you want to use rule
, you have to first move before the case goes to the
jury. And if the judge says no, I'll reserve it. Then
you move again after the jury. And if you don't, it's
got very tight timelines.
And you are arguing to a court that has held
that these limitations in the Federal rules must be
strictly observed. And I don't know of any time limit
in the Federal rules that's stricter than the rules that
involve 50(b).
MR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, there are
several answers to the waiver question. First of all,
this Court has the authority to based upon it because
the court appeal based upon it. Secondly, the court of
appeals correctly said that as the -- the plaintiffs had
told the judge, that motion, he need not rule on because
it is the same motion that the -- that had been made
earlier. Now the earlier motion was based upon the
TAPAA Act, as -- that it features it as a reason why the
court need not create or recognize a punitive damages
remedy. The second motion --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you didn't appeal on
that. You raised it properly, you lost on it, and you
didn't appeal on TAPAA.
MR. DELLINGER: That would be the case if we
hadn't raised it all. We raised it both times, the
court said it was the same motion. Here's what the
court of appeals said. The court of appeals said that
Exxon clearly and consistently argued statutory
preemption as one of the theories --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Statutory. But the
statute was TAPAA, and it was not the Clean Water Act.
MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. But the
essential argument, the court of appeals is the same,
and if the issue were not raised -- even if the issue
had not been raised at all in the trial court, even if
the had not been put before the district court, the
court of appeals still could have agreed to hear the
question of whether a punitive damages remedy is
obviated by the panoply of Federal statutes that are out
there. That -- that there is -- there was an exercise
of the court of appeals. The decision is now the law in
the Ninth Circuit and this Court has full authority to
review it, because as the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: As you know, there were
or at least some strong amici briefs in this case that
have asked this Court, tell the court of appeals that's
no way to operate vis-a-vis district courts.
MR. DELLINGER: Well, the -- even Professor
Miller recognizes that this is not jurisdictional and
that the court has the power to do it, the power to hear
this case. And it is before it. And -- and even if the
matter had not been raised in the district court, the
court of appeals had authority to consider it. And
there's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dellinger, did
you say you had a second and a third point?
MR. DELLINGER: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You going to get to
them?
MR. DELLINGER: Oh, uh -- yes, indeed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.
MR. DELLINGER: The -- the Clean Water Act,
the reason it's an important issue, is that the one
thing that Congress has not done, whether it's in TAPAA,
in the Clean Water Act or the Oil Pollution Act, is they
have not provided for punitive damages but moreover,
they have never had any remedy that is uncalibrated,
that is limitless, that is not carefully measured so
that it respects the need to protect the interests to be
protective by those laws, by the interest in clean
water, with a decision not to overdeter.
The problem with having a punitive damages
remedy in an area where punitive damages has played no
significant role, that is judge-made, is that it simply
obliterates the balance that Congress has struck. If
you look at the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're talking about
tradition. It has never been the tradition for criminal
statutes to have open-ended penalties. So that -- that
explains why the CWA has specific limits.
MR. DELLINGER: Even on civil fines, even on
other aspects of it, there is -- there is a careful
calibration. And once Congress has decided that the
limits of liability are twice the measurable pecuniary
loss, to add to that careful set of remedies that
Congress has adopted another remedy that is however many
billions of dollars the jury might choose totally
unsettled the scheme when Congress has addressed the
very issue. When you ask the question: Are punitive
damages available for oil spills, and you look at the
Clean Water Act, which covers so much of the territory
of this act, it is hard to make out the case that --
that there's a need for a judicially created remedy,
particularly when the judicially created remedy, unlike
something that was done by Congress comes without caps,
without structure, without guidance.
If Congress were to decide that a
punitive-damages remedy, it's likely that they would
place some kind of structural limits or caps on it and
not have this limitless, free-floating --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, perhaps that's a
segue to point No. 3. I don't wish to --
MR. DELLINGER: No. That's a -- I think
that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to cut you off. On
point --
MR. DELLINGER: Even if the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: On point No. 3 --
MR. DELLINGER: I'm sorry. You have a
question?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: My only question is this:
Assume that there will be punitive damages applicable to
Exxon under maritime law in in case. We have read in
the briefs about the limits that should be imposed on
these punitive damages. And those are from our
due-process cases.
If we are deciding this case as a matter of
our authority to determine Federal maritime law, are
there factors that we should include in a
punitive-damages framework that do not -- that do not
appear in our due-process cases? And, if so, what are
those factors?
MR. DELLINGER: Well, I think surely that's
right. And the -- your question recognizes, as have
individual Justices, that -- that here you are like a
State court in the sense that, as Justice Scalia said,
State courts have ample authority to eliminate
unfairness and to set their own rules in this area, as
you do here.
Now, the first --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You would say one of those
factors is the Clean Water Act, wouldn't you?
MR. DELLINGER: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if it is not
pre-emptive as a matter of law, it's one of the factors
that you can bring to the Court's attention, I suppose.
MR. DELLINGER: That is correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I take it, under that,
you would point to the double -- the provision for a
fine double the amount of the damages? That would be a
factor?
MR. DELLINGER: The --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if we're looking
for guidelines --
MR. DELLINGER: Yes. A double --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- double general damages
is a factor that we could -- that we could follow in the
maritime framework?
MR. DELLINGER: Yes, but you would look to
what the criminal penalty is that's actually imposed.
The Court has said civil fines are a better guide. And
the civil fine, the maximum civil fine here for both the
State of Alaska and the United States, would be $80
million.
If you look to what the responsible law
enforcement authorities and public officials of both the
United States and Alaska thought was the proper amount,
they imposed a criminal fine of $150 million, which was
reduced to $25 million because of the cleanup efforts
and the fact that Exxon prepaid $300 million of the
losses in advance.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about looking at
what this Court said in TXO was proper in a
punitive-damages case? That is, this spill was
horrendous, but it could have been far worse.
And so, under TXO, you look at what was the
-- could be the maximum damage that could have been
caused by this occurrence, and that could be many
times --
MR. DELLINGER: Well, there was -- first of
all, it would be different to look at potential harm if
the potential harm were attempted by the defendant, and
the defendant had been unable to carry out the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't --
MR. DELLINGER: -- the planned harm.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a factor here. I
mean, wasn't the example that the captain was trying to
maneuver the ship after the disaster in such a way that
would have made it much worse?
MR. DELLINGER: That was not even the basis
of liability that was put before the jury. And if you
-- and -- nor was it shown that that -- that that would
have caused harm.
What -- what you really have here is you --
the first thing you would start with, Justice Kennedy,
is to ask whether it is necessary for punishment and
deterrence.
And when you start with payments that have
reached $3.4 billion in terms of compensation, fines,
remediation, restitution, that clearly obviates the need
for deterrence.
And if you look to -- if you look to
punishment -- if you look to punishment, here the one
thing that is clear is that this was not an intentional
act. It was not malicious. The company did not stand
to make one dollar of profit. There was no effort to
enhance the profits of the company, nor was there any
possibility of concealment.
And what the -- what the Plaintiffs put
before this Court, the Respondents in this case, are a
number of issues that were never put before the jury,
not part of the case, by people who were not even
plaintiffs; matters that were outside of the record and
contrary to the instructions. So that the jury was told
compensation --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would be the
formulation of the rule if the Court thinks that any
added amount would not deter, and how do we know that?
How do you formulate this rule?
MR. DELLINGER: Well, it is absolutely
essential to formulate some kind of rule. The best
guide is to look, I think, at civil penalties, which
gets to -- to $80 million, but to look to what the Court
said in your opinion in State Farm, where -- where
compensatories are so substantial it may eliminate any
need for additional punitive-damages remedy. There's --
JUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to your
civil-penalty point?
MR. DELLINGER: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the problem with the
civil-penalty argument is -- that the civil penalties
were calibrated for environmental damage, and what we
are dealing with here is individual economic damage? So
we've got an apples and oranges comparison, haven't we?
MR. DELLINGER: Well, two responses:
First of all, the $150 million penalty did
-- the purpose of the Clean Water Act also includes
protection of property. So it's not just for the
environment. And, indeed, part of the reason for
cutting the $150 million award was the compensation that
had been paid.
But, secondly, if you --
JUSTICE SOUTER: To the -- for lost trade or
something?
MR. DELLINGER: Right. It -- even if you
took that as calibrated to the environmental damage, the
environmental damage was twice what the compensation --
the total compensation paid was $500 million. The
company paid nearly a billion dollars for natural
resources harm.
If $150 million was the right amount for the
environmental damage, then the right amount for the half
of that that constitutes the lost wages would be $75
million, which is itself close to the $80 million.
But here I think that it is incumbent upon
the Plaintiffs to show why you need deterrence when
there was no profit motive, and you've had to pay $3.4
million dollars. And when if you look to punishment,
that can't be a black hole into which all the limits on
punitive damages disappear.
It's whether that -- if this Court can't set
standards that would limit an award of this kind, that
is a reason for believing that this ought to be done by
Congress if there are going to be punitive damages.
I'd like to reserve --
JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- I mean, the
obvious kind of thing would to be say that the standard
would depend upon the reprehensibility of the conduct of
the officer of the corporation, including the captain,
if you lost on that.
And where we said roughly before zero to 10
-- and you are quite right that this is a huge amount of
money -- you'd say zero to five, up to five times. I
mean that would be rough and ready. But the idea would
be to impose enormous deterrence upon large firms
involved in your industry that you are representing not
to make certain the officers on the ship behave in a
reprehensible way.
It's crude, but I mean that's the kind of
thing that we said in the due-process cases.
MR. DELLINGER: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then why wouldn't you --
MR. DELLINGER: Keep in --
JUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't you --
MR. DELLINGER: Keep in mind that the
largest award in the history of punitive damages was an
award for 500,000. That was 1/14 --
JUSTICE BREYER: You're going to say --
you're going to hear in two seconds -- they're going to
say this is the company that makes the most amazing
profit, et cetera. And so you're trying to deter them.
So we know what, you know -- so, what do you say to
that?
MR. DELLINGER: I -- I say that this -- that
the amount is enough to deter anybody for anything when
it is $3.4 billion. And it's hard to know how you could
have a punitive rationale for something which was
unintentional, not designed to make a profit, and could
not have been concealed.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Fisher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Each of the three rulings at issue here
rests firmly in the mainstream of American tort law.
And there is no reason in maritime jurisprudence to
depart from those rules.
I want to start with the first question
presented, what Exxon calls the vicarious liability
issue. And I think it's important to frame the
discussion by starting with the actual jury instruction
that's at issue in this case. It's at Pet. App. 301a.
It says that a managerial agent is someone
who supervises other employees and has responsibility
for, and authority over, particular aspects of a
corporation's business.
And, as Justice Ginsburg noted, Exxon has
never disputed that Captain Hazelwood satisfied this
definition. As its own internal documents explain,
Captain Hazelwood was in charge of what they called a
business unit of Exxon Shipping. He was in charge of
hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment, of
product; he was in charge of budgeting and personnel
with respect to the vessel; he was also in charge of
safety. He was the person who decided on behalf of
Exxon that it was safe to leave port the night of March
, 1989.
Now, it is our submission that it is
perfectly appropriate to expose the corporation to
punitive damages based on the reckless acts of such an
individual.
In doing so, it does not, as Exxon would
contend, impose vicarious liability. Rather, what it
does is it exposes a corporation to liability based on
its own culpability.
The very point of the restatement test, as
opposed to the vicarious liability rule that is followed
by the majority of the States, is that it requires some
complicity on the part of the corporation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's the
lookout posted -- I don't know if they have one -- but
the lookout posted in the front of the ship, and he is
drunk, and doesn't see the reef or something? Is the
corporation liable in that case?
MR. FISHER: Not for punitive damages,
Mr. Chief Justice. And the reason why is because the
lookout does not run a business unit of Exxon Shipping.
What is happening here -- and I want to
focus on this for a moment because Mr. Dellinger --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you regard the
ship as a business unit?
MR. FISHER: That's what Exxon regarded the
ship as, and so that's what the record says. And the
idea is that you had --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's different if
they say that it's -- depending on how they categorize
the different units tells whether they are liable or
not?
MR. FISHER: Well, I don't want to rest
primarily on labels. The idea is function. And I
think, going back to the instruction, what the
instruction is asking the jury to determine is: Is this
a person who has authority over an aspect of a
corporation's business? I think a shorthand for that is
in Exxon's own documents that it is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: In respect, I mean, the
janitor has authority over an aspect of the corporation.
I mean, surely, that can't be the test.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think the authority --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume the test is the
person has to be high enough that it justifies holding
the entire corporation. And I doubt whether a captain
is -- is high enough. How many of these units does
Exxon have?
MR. FISHER: There are about 20 vessels like
the Valdez.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Twenty vessels.
MR. FISHER: Now, I think Mr. Chief Justice
had it right when he said it's no answer to say it can't
be the master; it has to be the corporation. The
corporation can only act through people. So there has
to be a line drawing that takes place.
Now, this notion of the idea that the master
isn't good enough because he had to be a policymaker is
new to us.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was a question
that I asked, not a statement.
Well, how do you draw the line? I mean, is
the second in command on the boat a man responsible for
policy?
MR. FISHER: He may not be. I don't think
the question is whether he's responsible for policy.
Again, it's whether he's the person in charge.
What Exxon during instruction to the
district court asked the jury to be required to find is
that there was a shore-based supervisory official of the
Exxon defendants who made the decision. So Exxon itself
recognized that you have to draw the line somewhere.
We think the best place to draw the line,
and the conservative place to law, the line is the
managerial-agent rule that's in the Restatement.
Now, Mr. Dellinger says there are eight
States that follow a different rule. And it's important
to understand that that's not the case. Even among the
States that follow the Lake Shore formulation in
general, you still have to have a way to implement it.
It's not -- the idea is if the corporation has to be
complicit, you still have to tell the jury which human
beings they can look to for that complicity.
So at page 33 of our red brief --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the Lake Shore --
well, I thought the Lake Shore and Amiable whatever it
is principle was that a captain ain't one of those. The
captain doesn't -- doesn't do the job.
MR. FISHER: There was no captain at issue
in Amiable Nancy. And, Of course, there wasn't a
captain at issue in Lake Shore, because it was a
land-based case.
But on page 33 of our red brief we've given
you seven -- several States that say we follow the
complicity test, and here's how you do it. You require
the jury to find that the person is at least a
managerial agent.
Exxon itself in its reply brief on page --
page 11, footnote 5, cites several States. And I gather
these are the States to which Mr. Dellinger is referring
when he says there are eight States that follow our
rule.
Well, we did some research after getting the
reply brief, and I want to give you a few cites, because
it illustrates the principle yet again. Several of
those States say we follow the Lake Shore complicity
idea. And, therefore, the way we do it is we require a
jury to find at least a managerial agent. So Kansas is
a State that Exxon cites.
In the Flint Hills case at 941 P.2d 374,
Kansas says the way in modern times you implement Lake
Shore is you require a managerial agent. In
Connecticut, the Stoltz case 867 A.2d 860, and in the
D.C. Circuit, Justice Scalia, they quote one of your
opinions. If you look at D.C. law, the D.C. Court of
Appeals itself and a D.C. circuit in another case have
said -- and this is the Arthur Young case, 631 A.2d 354,
and the GMAC case at 273 F.2d 92 --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do any of those cases say
the managerial agent is liable if he violated express
instructions from an employer?
MR. FISHER: No State tort case that we're
aware of, Justice Kennedy, adopts -- I think what you're
referring to is the Kolstad policy exception.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because that's what the
last part of your instruction 33 says. And it does seem
to me that this captain may be managerial for some
purposes and not others. I think that's the way it's
going to have to come out. Maybe not. But certainly he
was not entitled to set aside the policy of Exxon that
you cannot navigate a vessel while intoxicated.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think I want to say two
things. The first is that, as I understand it, Exxon
has conceded across the board that Captain Hazelwood is
a managerial agent. And in this case -- in this Court's
own Kolstad case, if you look at it again, it says
Amiable Nancy, Lake Shore and the way you implement
that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But they have not conceded
the accuracy or correctness of instruction 33. And
that's because he was not entitled to set aside the
policy on intoxication.
MR. FISHER: Well, if you were to adopt a
rule that no other State has adopted, which is to say
there was a policy defense in ordinary tort cases, which
unlike Kolstad do not rest on the subjective knowledge
of the actor, even then, we submit, we tried that issue
in this case, Justice Kennedy; and there was -- Exxon
had every opportunity to argue policy. In its closing
argument to the jury, the only policy it mentioned was
the policy of two officers on the bridge while
transporting --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Your instruction says
if he was a managerial agent, his acts are attributable
to the corporation. That's it.
MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Kennedy.
We think that's the proper rule of law.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the corporation's
responsibility or complicity or culpability is simply
not relevant under your theory of the case, even though
that's what you talk about in your brief.
MR. FISHER: Well, I don't want to act like
a dog chasing his tail here, Justice Kennedy, but the
idea is to ask whether the corporation is culpable, you
have to ask which people. And what happened in this
Court's own decision in Kolstad said in implementing
Lake Shore that you look to the managerial agents. And
that's what --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's why I'm
interested in the same question I asked on the other
side. As I read Lake Shore, it seemed to me my first
reading of it that it picked up this distinction that
Justice Story made, and it said quite right, you could
impute punitives or exemplary damages to a corporation
where its managerial official is the one who causes --
who behaves recklessly. But wait, we don't mean quite
that. We mean some managerial officials.
And they seem to refer in the admiralty
case, I'll tell you one who he isn't, namely, the ship's
captain. He's not in that category. And then in this
other case, they say -- they talk about a superintending
agent authorized to imply, employ, and discharge the
conductor.
And they give that as an example of a
managerial official where there would not be exemplary
damages assessed against the corporation in light of his
conduct.
So when I read that, I thought that this
Lake Shore case is just picking up the earlier case; and
that's the Federal law. And you've given the examples
where the State law has changed; and I have no doubt you
are right. You read the cases very well.
But is there an example where I could say
that the Federal law has changed, too? And you started
down that track, but the reason this is of probably more
than inordinate concern to me is that I wrote the case
in Sand, I wrote a dissent in Legion, I looked into
stare decisis law and made fairly clear views of what it
So what would you say to someone who has
accepted certain legal principles that we have had in
prior cases? And you want to say nonetheless you win.
Okay. Why?
MR. FISHER: Three reasons, Justice Breyer.
The first is with all due respect, Amiable Nancy did not
involve the wrongdoing of the captain. It involved the
wrongdoing of a lower officer on the ship; and so
it's -- there's nothing in the Amiable Nancy that deals
with captains, so you don't have a stare decisis effect
that comes from Amiable Nancy with respect to captains.
The second thing is there are some more
recent Federal cases that discuss the Lake Shore
managerial agent idea. We've cited them in our -- in
our red brief along through -- I'm flipping now -- but
there are RICO cases; there are other cases, and
Mr. Dellinger said, where statutory case -- statutory
regimes need to be implemented. And we have cited
several lower court decisions that look to the
managerial agent rule to do that, none of this Court.
The third thing is to understand, as you
talked about in Lake Shore, you are having to pick
somebody, and the general idea is higher up is okay, and
way down low is not okay. Fletcher in his Cyclopedia on
corporations says that if the Lake Shore idea is to make
sense today, you have to understand that when you're
dealing with humongous corporations, you have to look
not just to the president or vice president -- and this
is what the D.C. Circuit said in the GMAC case as well
-- is that when you deal with multinational corporations
with tens of thousands of employees and divisions, you
look to -- you look a little bit lower down than those
top job titles to managers.
And so again this is what Professor
Schoenbaum says in his amicus brief to this Court
dealing with that from a maritime perspective.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher, you --
your friend says in his reply brief that you cannot cite
one U.S. maritime case that has allowed vicarious
liability for punitive damages. Is this the first one?
MR. FISHER: No, it would not be, Mr. Chief
Justice. What we did --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's your best
case?
MR. FISHER: What we did our reply brief --
I'm sorry, what we did in our red brief is cite to
Professor Robertson's article in saying that he
collected the cases, and which he did; and so our best
cases are the City of Carlisle case, the Ludlow and
Ralston against States Rights is very close. There's a
distinction in Ralston versus exemplary --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's take --
take the Ludlow. Mr. Dellinger says that's a case where
the court found that the owner is not vicariously
liable.
MR. FISHER: We don't think that's the right
reading of the case. We submit -- we have a footnote in
our own brief that says that there are only two cases
that they cite in which a captain's conduct is not
imputed to the ship's owner. They are both more than
0 years old, and neither of them deal with
corporations.
So I think it is entirely fair to say that
you have more or less an open issue before you today.
What I think I want to be sure the Court understands,
though, is that there is not a stare decisis problem
that this Court has to confront with respect to the
first question. You have a spattering of a few old
cases that lean in different directions.
JUSTICE BREYER: And so it differs from
Sand, for example, where they are like two cases?
MR. FISHER: Pardon me?
JUSTICE BREYER: It differs from Sand? You
say it is not -- I'm interested in your last remark. In
the Sand ways I found -- you know we went through it,
public policy was on the other side. But -- but we had
several cases, it wasn't a thousand; it was more like
two; and the Supreme Court had said in two cases, one
very clearly, you know -- you see the point there.
MR. FISHER: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why do you say there is no
stare decisis problem?
MR. FISHER: Well, because neither Amiable
Nancy nor the Lake Shore case, which are the only two
cases from this Court, dealt with a managerial agent.
The more recent cases from this Court, Hydrolevel and
Kolstad -- Hydrolevel says any agent for treble damages
for antitrust, and Kolstad follows the managerial agent
principle, following in the natural evolution of Amiable
Nancy and Lake Shore.
So I don't think this Court has ever
considered it to be any stare decisis problem, even if
all of the lower courts were lined up against it, which
is far from the -- far from the case here. What you
have is a just few lower courts in either correction. I
gather that's one of the reasons why this Court decided
to grant certiorari in this case, because there's some
dispute among the lower courts as to exactly how this
principle works in maritime law.
But again, we don't think there's any
problem with this Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That, and $3.5 billion.
(Laughter.)
MR. FISHER: I said one of the reasons,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's some confusion,
Mr. Fisher, about this Kolstad. I take your -- it has
entered this case at two levels. One is this business
about the company policy; but as far as Exxon having a
policy, you don't mix alcohol with employment on a
tanker; but Kolstad said it has to be a consistently
enforced policy. So you don't have any problem with
Kolstad on that issue, if you're using it here for a
managerial --
MR. FISHER: Kolstad starts from the
proposition of managerial agent is the proper way to
implement a complicity rule.
There's a second part of Kolstad that says
we have to change what we think is the ordinary common
law rule, the proper Federal common law rule. We have
to change it in the context of Title VII because of the
unusual situation in which employers can be held liable
based on the subjective knowledge of the wrongdoer; and
tort law is exactly the opposite. It is an objective
test. And so there's no worry in imposing punitive
damages here, that you're going to -- that you're going
to dissuade an employer from training its employees.
Now, on the facts, even if you were to agree
with me on that legal argument, you're exactly right on
the facts, Justice Ginsburg. Exxon had a paper alcohol
policy that prohibited drinking aboard ship, just like
the Coast Guard has a policy to that effect. But the
evidence in this case was that Exxon didn't enforce it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So in your theory of the
case, instruction 33, if the superior had told Hazelwood
don't pilot the ship today, Exxon would still be liable?
That's your theory of the case under instruction 33?
MR. FISHER: On the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or the last part of the
instruction 36, I think.
MR. FISHER: On the first part of the case
in phase one that was our -- that was the legal theory,
Justice -- you're right, Justice Kennedy. But in phase
three of the trial when a jury decided whether to award
punitive damages, the instructions told it, among other
things -- this is instruction 30 in phase three -- it
told among other things to consider whether or not the
wrongdoers were violating company policy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that -- that
goes to measures, not to liability.
MR. FISHER: Absolutely.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was the first phase.
And that's the instruction, it seems to me, that you
have to explain.
MR. FISHER: Well, I -- I accept that, and I
think I've explained that by distinguishing an ordinary
tort case from the situation in Title VII. I think it's
instructive for this Court, and we agree with Exxon that
when this Court sits as a maritime court, it looks for
guidance to what other State courts have done. And we
think it's instructive that not one single State court,
either before or after Kolstad, has adopted a policy
defense for defendants. There's simply no such decision
on the books outside of discrimination cases.
We think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your
position of how to look at the case if you have a
managerial employee who acts contrary to corporate
policy? Is the corporation still exposed to punitive
damages?
MR. FISHER: In a tort case, Your Honor?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In a case like this.
MR. FISHER: Yes. We think -- and that's --
and that's what instruction Justice Kennedy --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what can a
corporation do to protect itself against punitive
damages awards such as this?
MR. FISHER: Well, it can hire fit and
competent people who it decides --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and assume it
has a policy that we will hire fit and competent people?
MR. FISHER: Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're saying --
that's the question I'm asking. What if there is a
breach of the corporate policy? I don't see what more a
corporation can do. I mean, your --- other than --
other than what? I mean it has to say that the policy
is this, and if somebody breaks the policy, they're
liable for compensatory damages, which can as this case
shows be in the billions of dollars, and of course the
individual is liable for punitive and other awards.
But what more can the corporation do other
than say here is our policies? And try to implement
them.
MR. FISHER: Apart from adopting a policy,
they need to implement it soundly. And the argument
you're making, if I understand it correctly, would
obtain just as easily if the vice president of Exxon
Corporation or the president of Exxon Shipping, whom
Mr. Dellinger says would put Exxon on the hook, had made
the decision to put Joe Hazelwood in command of this
ship. And so you always have the problem --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At that level -- at
that level, the president, I think you would have an
argument that the policy was being changed. It's not
clear that that argument works when you're dealing with
someone at Mr. Hazelwood's level.
MR. FISHER: Well, in some -- I think in
some respects we're back to the argument of where you
draw the line. But let's look at the conduct in this
case. Who made the decision that it was safe to depart
port that night on behalf of Exxon Corporation? Captain
Hazelwood. The record unequivocally says that Captain
Hazelwood is the one who made that policy decision.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me throw this thought
on the table. If the policy is made by the board of
directors, can the president unilaterally change the
policy? The Chief seems to be suggesting he could?
MR. FISHER: I don't think so.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me we have
this problem, the president of the company is the same
as the vice president.
MR. FISHER: I think that's the point that I
was trying to make.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose that would
go to how consistently and how effectively the policy is
enforced. If the president of the company isn't
following the policy it's not going to be taken very
seriously. That's different than saying you have a
situation where on an episodic and sporadic basis a firm
company policy is breached, the individual is breaching
the policy.
MR. FISHER: Well, if we're to the point
where the question is whether or not the policy was
enforced, we'll very happily rest on the record in this
case, because that was what we tried to the jury: That
there was no serious alcohol policy that was enforced.
We showed 33 instances in the record of
Exxon employees drinking with Hazelwood or learning that
he drank. Up and down the corporation, as the district
judge explained, for three years, upper management was
receiving reports that this man was drinking aboard the
vessel.
Now, its policy, Mr. Chief Justice, was that
that was not allowed. But over a three-year span, as
the district judge found again and again and again, they
were told there was a problem.
JUSTICE BREYER: That wouldn't -- you might
win on that one. I mean if you show that. They have --
we have to assume that that isn't so, don't we --
MR. FISHER: I think you assume --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- for purposes of this
argument?
MR. FISHER: Well, two -- two points,
Justice Breyer:
On answering the first question presented --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay, that's all.
MR. FISHER: -- you assume --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's fine.
MR. FISHER: -- unless we can show -- unless
we can make an overwhelming harmless errors --
JUSTICE BREYER: On the second and third,
this is what --
MR. FISHER: The second and third, I think
you assume the facts --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- some time available. I
would like you to address at some point at your
convenience what should the standards be if, in fact,
the captain of a ship, or responsible for conditions,
for example, negligence or recklessness is now going to
be not only imputed to the corporation but subject for
punitives.
Now, what I'm interested in, in the back of
my mind is: This is a very dramatic accident. It
involves oil spills, and they cause a enormous amount of
trouble. But there are accidents every day, and ships
are filled with accidents like automobiles in other
places. And there are all kinds of things that go
wrong.
And if, in fact, it has not been normal in
admiralty until now to assess punitives against the
corporation on the basis of the activity of, say, the
ship's master, failures of responsibility, then it will
be a new world for the shipping industry and for those
who work on the ships.
What happens when a sailor slips and is
hurt, and it's very serious to that sailor, et cetera?
What principles do you have to suggest, if any, for
creating a fair system that isn't just arbitrary?
MR. FISHER: Well, I think this is the
perfect segue from the first and third questions. As I
transfer there, I want to point out that I think the
only reason that we heard in the first -- the first
portion of the argument for absolving Exxon of
responsibility in the situation is because of the
dangerousness of captaining vessels like this.
This Court has already addressed that
concern in its collision doctrine, and tort law
generally addresses the problem of dangerous activities
and split-second decisions. And the answer to that is
they are simply not reckless when somebody makes a
good-faith decision in a crisis in the midst of
dangerous activity. So we don't think there's any
special rule that is necessary with respect to the first
question presented.
Now, you asked me how do deal with it in
terms of the size of the award. We think -- first of
all, I think that if I can beg to differ slightly with
the way you framed it, as Professor Robertson explained,
punitive damages are -- have always been firmly
established in maritime law.
And then just because there haven't been
that many cases doesn't tell you that they've been
frowned upon. It just means that we haven't had that
many cases that have resulted in reported decisions.
Now, in looking to guidance, this Court
isn't sitting as a maritime court. So it -- it's siting
as a common-law-type court. We think the best place to
start is with the common-law tradition, which is that
cases are tried to juries; juries make the first
decision; and then the trial court reviews for passion
and prejudice and for substantial evidence, as our trial
court did here. And then the court of appeals reviews
that for abuse of discretion.
If there's anything more that's necessary in
maritime law, we submit Congress has already stepped
into the breach with the Limitation of Liability Act.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Correct me if I'm wrong.
You've read the case -- our case in Cooper, which says
that the appellate court has to examine de novo to
determine the adequacy or the excessiveness of the award
to deter.
MR. FISHER: I think that's a constitutional
holding. What this Court said in Cooper was if --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then, a fortiori, it
gives us the right and the duty to do so as -- sitting
as a common-law-type court.
MR. FISHER: Yes. I'm not going to fight
you on that, Justice Kennedy. There was an earlier
sentence in Cooper that says if no constitutional issue
is raised, the only thing an appellate court should do
is review for abuse of discretion. But I think that
ultimately you end up in the same place, which is that
there's a de novo review of the excessive -- of whether
the award is excessive based on the facts that have been
-- that have been tried.
And if this Court is going to adopt a set of
guideposts for maritime law, we think the proper place
to look is the due- process cases this Court has already
decided.
This Court has already -- in its due-process
cases, the Court looked to the common law. That's
where, I gather, the guideposts this Court adopted came
from: Reprehensibility, in particular, which this Court
said was the most important indicia, as well as a
reasonable relationship, what's commonly referred to as
the "ratio test."
JUSTICE SCALIA: What about -- what about
looking to the Clean Water Act? And I wanted to ask you
this question about the Act. Assuming we agree with you
that -- that it was too late to raise the Clean Water
Act as a separate pre-emptive factor in the case, why
was it too late in the appellate court to raise the
Clean Water Act as an additional reason why maritime law
should not be interpreted to allow punitive damages and,
in part 3 of the case, as a factor, why punitive damages
of the amount at issue here should not be allowed?
It seems to me there it's not a new
argument. It's just an additional factor for arguments
that have already been made.
MR. FISHER: I think I accept what you said,
Justice Scalia. The third -- with respect to the size
of the award, we never contested Exxon's ability to
argue that the Clean Water Act is one place you can
look.
So, if you were to look to the Clean Water
Act, you initially have the problem that Justice Souter
mentioned. You have the apples and oranges problem.
The Clean Water Act sets a fine cording to the
environmental harm. Now, the State of Alaska had that
estimated in its -- and this is in its brief -- and that
came out to be -- I believe the number is about
$2.6 billion.
So, if you were to look -- if you were to
put aside the apples and oranges problem and look to the
Clean Water Act, then you get almost the number that
we're standing here with today.
If you look at the harm a different way, you
still get an extremely large number. You get $500
million of compensation to the Plaintiffs. And then on
top of that, we think in light of the way this Court has
addressed ratio analysis in its other cases, you need to
take account of the fact that there are vast injuries
that have not resulted in any compensation.
So to do any kind of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. That's part 3. What
about part 2? Why -- why can't the Petitioner raise the
argument or why could not the Petitioner raise it in the
court of appeals? Okay, we agree that the Clean Water
Act does not pre-empt the granting of punitive damages
here, but one of the factors that we ought to take into
account in deciding whether modern admiralty law in this
situation permits punitive damages is the existence of
the Clean Water Act. That's not a pre-emption thing.
Is that also waived, do you think?
MR. FISHER: Well, I think it would be
because that's -- they never made that argument in the
district court, and they didn't make that argument to
the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't have to make
every tiny little argument. I mean, you can think of
additional points on appeal so long as it's under the
same major heading. And the major heading here is not
the Clean Water Act pre-empts punitive damages; the
major heading is, rather, modern admiralty law does not
permit. And, you know, they had made other arguments
about prior cases; they had talked about State law; and
this is just another argument: By the way, here's
another one. There's the Clean Water Act.
MR. FISHER: Well, they didn't make that
argument, but if they had, I don't think it ends up
being any different than their pre-emption argument
because -- remember their pre-emption argument isn't a
pure pre-emption argument. They're not here today
saying the Plaintiffs can't recover compensatory
damages, as was the case in the Milwaukee and Illinois
case, for example. What they're saying is that the
Clean Water Act displaces our ability to recover
punitive damages.
And there, by making the argument that I
gather you've sketched out, it looks very much like the
same argument that they didn't properly make.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's close.
MR. FISHER: But it doesn't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't really say
pre-emption, and so it's -- it's just another factor to
consider when you decide what the evolving law of
admiralty requires.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a statute that
was raised in the district court. And the district
court raised this TAPA Act, and they thought that that
was the statutory guide, and that was the reason why
there should not be punitive damages, but -- so that was
one of the things the court of appeals said under the
head of waiver. They're substituting one federal
statute for another.
MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Ginsburg.
And at page 103 of the joint appendix, the district
court ruled on that motion and held that TAPAA was the
statute that was controlling with respect to spills of
trans-Alaska oil and that the savings clause of TAPAA
expressly preserved our ability to seek punitive
damages.
That's a ruling that, as you noted, Exxon
never appealed, and so it is the law of the case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A while ago you were
about to make a point on the Limitation of Liability
Act.
MR. FISHER: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A little while ago,
you were about to make a point on the Limitation of
Liability Act.
MR. FISHER: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I was -- I would
have thought that cuts heavily against you on the third
point. In other words, if we're looking to guidance,
you look to Federal law. And whether it's directly
applicable or not, the Limitation of Liability Act
reflects a very strong Federal policy about restricting
liability on shipowners, adopted at a time when it was
intended to encourage maritime -- the maritime economy.
And why isn't that something we should look to, at least
under question three?
MR. FISHER: Well, as I said, I agree you
should look to it, but you should do it in a way this
Court's Miles decision instructs. It says that Congress
doesn't just enact general policies. By enacting a
statute that gives some protection, Congress indicates
not just a general policy, but more importantly, the
sphere into which that policy is to be given effect.
And so the notion that Congress did step in
and give shipowners some protection but left out
shipowners like Exxon that behave in the manner at issue
in this case, we think is a strong --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that means
they don't get the really quite extraordinary protection
that the limitation of liability gives. It doesn't mean
that we should ignore the reflection of that policy
outside the confines of the Limitation of Liability Act.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think -- I think you
should look to it and understand that Congress has
declined to give the protection. In OPA 90, which was
passed right after the spill in direct response to the
spill, Congress made explicit that the Limitation Act
should never apply to spills of Trans-Alaska oil. And
the TAPAA did the same thing in the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The argument is not
that the Limitation of Liability Act should apply. It's
that it would be very strange to say, where Congress has
radically reduced the exposure of shipowners in one
area, that we as a matter of development of Federal
common law, Federal maritime law should allow
dramatically expanded punitive liability in another area
of shipowning liability.
MR. FISHER: Well, we don't think we're
asking for any kind of expansion of liability. All
we're asking is for the traditional admiralty rule which
has been recognized by Justice Story early on and all
through the cases that in cases of reckless indifference
a shipowner can be held liable for punitive damages.
The only thing --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Fisher, the problem I
have -- maybe it isn't a problem I have, but a question
that that argument raises is this:
We know something now that Justice Story did
not know, and that is we've had an awful lot more
experience with punitive damages practice. And we've
spent the last decade or so of this Court dealing with
the problem of how to set constitutional limits for
awards which sort of by most people's standards verged
on the excessive.
The problem that we've had -- we've had two
problems in coming up with those constitutional
standards:
One is we can't simply substitute ourselves
as lawmakers for the State. We're talking about
constitutional limits, not optimum standards.
And number two, given those limits on us, we
have not been able to come up with anything that could
be called determinant standards. We've never, for
example, found a sufficient reason constitutionally to
put an absolute ratio kind of limit on it.
But here, as you were pointing out earlier,
we're sitting as a kind of common-law court. We are in
the position of the States here.
Why shouldn't we recognize the difficulty of
trying to deal with indeterminate limits which we've
proven in the constitutional context and say, therefore,
we've simply got to come up with a number, because no
other way is going to give us any kind of an
administrable standard; and our number -- and I'm not
saying this should be it -- but our number is going to
be double the compensatory damages? That's the limit.
Would that be an illegitimate thing for us
to do or an unwise thing for us to do?
MR. FISHER: Well, I think it would -- I'll
stick with unwise, Justice Souter.
(Laughter.)
MR. FISHER: And I think the reason why is
because we agree with that. You should -- you should
look to the experience of the States. Not one single
State, as a matter of common law authority, has set a
bright-line ratio. The only place --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- the United
States Code, the general criminal code, 18 U.S.C. 3571,
has exactly that number. It's -- for -- it's double the
pecuniary loss for a criminal act.
And it seems to me, if when we're looking
for guidance, as Justice Souter quite properly indicated
we must, and Justice Scalia has indicated with reference
to the Water Act, that this is -- gives us a very
valuable instruction.
MR. FISHER: We think that's one place this
Court can look. But again, a common-law court, we
believe, sets standards, not a bright-line rule. If you
were to adopt some sort of bright-line statute, you'd
have to deal with any number of legislative problems
that the several States have dealt with and Congress,
when it has passed these kinds of limits.
First, you have to decide the ratio number.
You have to pull something out there. Then you have to
decide is it on a per capita basis in terms of -- what
several States have done is they've set a limit, that a
ratio only kicks in at a certain dollar amount. In this
case, it's worth remembering that the plaintiffs are
only standing to recover $75,000 a piece in punitive
damages.
Now, most States that even have caps, or
several of the States at least, say they don't apply if
the awards are under a $100,000 per capita.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why? What's even the
theory of that? Because the theory of punitives is that
the individual who's receiving the money wasn't hurt one
penny's worth?
MR. FISHER: But the theory --
JUSTICE BREYER: And that really the money
ought to go to the people generally in the State or it
ought to go to other people, rather than those people
who have already been compensated. That's the theory of
MR. FISHER: I think that's --
JUSTICE BREYER: That exhibits the
difficulty for me of trying to figure out how to do it.
MR. FISHER: I think the theory of the
States, Justice Breyer, is that if you hurt lots and
lots of people, it's a worse act than if you only hurt
one or two. And so if you have, as in this case,
destroyed an entire regional economy, that it would be
inappropriate to give some sort of credit for that by a
lower ratio just because you've harmed more people.
Now, there's also --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't the measure what
is necessary to deter? Isn't that what we've asked
first and foremost, not exclusively perhaps?
MR. FISHER: Well, I think you've looked at
punishment and deterrence, Justice Kennedy.
And if I could finish the last thing I want
to say about looking at a ratio, several States that
even have ratios carve out drunk driving cases and cases
involving intoxication from any other otherwise
applicable limits. And that's -- I think one reason
why, Justice Kennedy, is deterrence. And so, I think
let's start with deterrence, but I want to frame that
discussion by recognizing that in Cooper this Court said
that deterrence is not the only goal; you also look to
punishment.
Now, I think Exxon's primary argument on
deterrence grounds is that we've paid $3.4 billion out
of our pocket already as a result of this spill, and
that's a lot of money. The reality is, once they get
their tax credit and insurance benefits for that money,
the number is really under 2 billion. But it's still a
lot of money.
And so I think it's important to look at the
district court proceedings involving the Clean Water
Act, involving the criminal prosecution here, and ask
whether it makes sense to have Exxon pay additional
money in punitive damages. We think it is.
The first thing to understand is that the
same district judge that saw the criminal proceedings in
this case sat over our trial. He understood what the
criminal case was about, and what it was about was the
environment. That was only thing on the table in the
criminal case. And so, when we tried to argue --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was a different
jury. And the jury is the one that set the amount of
punitive damages.
MR. FISHER: There was no jury, of course,
in the criminal case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
MR. FISHER: But there was a jury in our
case. The district judge reviewed that and said, after
being instructed in instruction number 36 in our case --
and this is something that we tried -- the chairman of
Exxon took the stand in trial and gave the jury a chart
of all the money that Exxon had paid out of its pocket
and told the jury: We've been deterred enough, so you
shouldn't award any punitive damages. And the jury, of
course, rejected that argument that Exxon made.
And the district judge reviewing that
decision -- and this is around page 240 to 245 of the
petition appendix -- the district judge said: I think
the jury had ample reason to do so. And remember to the
tune of $5 billion. And so why did the district judge
think that? Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is the same
judge who approved the instruction that said Hazelwood's
negligence and recklessness is automatically imputed to
Exxon, right?
MR. FISHER: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he was operating
that under understanding of the law.
MR. FISHER: Well, not when he was reviewing
the size of the award, Mr. Chief Justice.
In the criminal case, the statement of facts
supporting the guilty plea in the criminal case -- and
remember, we're only talking about environment in the
criminal case -- and in terms of punishment, the only
money for punishment in the criminal case is $25
million. All the rest of the money is, as the district
court said, to clean up Exxon's mess or to put money
into the environment.
Now, for $25 million fine that Exxon paid in
the criminal case, the district judge explained -- or
I'm sorry, the district judge approved the statement
that the U.S. attorney submitted, which said the basis
for this is that the captain and the third mate were
negligent. That was the only thing even there.
It wasn't until our trial and our discovery
that it was brought out that the complicity of the
organization ran far deeper. And so at our -- phase
three of our trial, which was entirely about Exxon's
conduct, not any more at all about Captain Hazelwood's
conduct -- in phase three of our trial we started out
the closing argument by saying here's the relevant
evidence for the jury.
And we played something for the jury called
Trial Compilation 9. Now, that appears at appears at
page 1295 of the joint appendix, and we actually
submitted a videotape that we have submitted to the
Clerk's office, and it is sitting in the Clerk's office.
There are 50 segments in Trial Compilation
, and all 50 deal with Exxon's upper management
receiving reports of Hazelwood's conduct and deeming it
a gross error to put him in command and so forth, all
there.
So it wasn't until the trial in our case
that it came out how deep the complicity ran in the
organization and how reprehensible the conduct was.
And in reviewing the award the district
judge said: Now, with that level of complicity and
reprehensibility, I think the jury could have decided
that Exxon should be punished for this --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is the relevance?
MR. FISHER: -- occurrence.
JUSTICE BREYER: What's the relevance of the
leg that we're assuming Exxon, other than the captain,
did bad things?
MR. FISHER: We submit that --
JUSTICE BREYER: You seem to be now talking
about the evidence that they did bad things. But that's
the leg that they did --
MR. FISHER: The district judge said that
this is what he deemed a critical factor supporting the
punitive award.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, doesn't that show,
then, that there had to be a finding that they did the
bad thing?
MR. FISHER: No. If you accept our argument
in the first that to get in the door, all we had to show
was that a managerial agent was reckless and that
Captain Hazelwood, as Exxon conceded, Was a managerial
agent. When you are reviewing the size of the award --
and I think we're talking about the third question
presented, the size of the award -- all the -- all the
evidentiary questions are resolved in favor of us, and
certainly they are resolved in a way that conducting de
novo reviews, a lower court understood and told this
Court what the record was. And it is all about the
three years that they knew Captain Hazelwood was
drinking.
But I don't want to leave Justice Kennedy's
question about deterrence, because even if this Court
looks at the payments Exxon has made from a perspective
of deterrence, there are two legs in which Exxon has
clearly not been deterred. The first is that Exxon's
own executives testified to Congress shortly after the
spill that the results of the spill were, quote, "pretty
much as we envisioned."
Now, it was also common knowledge in the
organization, and this came out at trial, that the idea
of putting a drunken master in charge of a supertanker
was a potential for disaster and incalculably raised the
chances of a disaster and a catastrophic spill
occurring. Knowing all this; knowing what could happen;
knowing that the industry did not have sufficient
cleanup equipment to contain a big spill; knowing that
tens of thousands of Alaskans that depended on Exxon
taking proactive action, the kind of action that
Congress had demanded in passing the TAPAA; Exxon
nonetheless left Captain Hazelwood in command over a
three-year span. So it wasn't deterred by knowing what
would happen if the tanker ran aground.
Even if you look at it from the perspective
of having paid the money out of its pocket, what did it
do? It still hadn't been deterred. In the wake of the
spill, and this is part of Trial Compilation 9, and this
was part of the argument to the jury, Exxon fired one
person -- Captain Hazelwood. They reassigned the third
mate. Everybody else up -- further up the chain of
command who allowed this to happen received bonuses and
raises. They have taken no action inside the company to
express in any meaningful way that they've been deterred
by what happened in this incident --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher --
MR. FISHER: -- and the amount of money that
they've had to pay.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- your time is running
out. And this there's one question I'd like you to
address, and that is are there other cases against Exxon
seeking compensation and punitive damages based on this
oil spill that are still awaiting trial or decision? Or
is this it?
MR. FISHER: By definition,
Justice Ginsburg, this is a mandatory punitive class, so
this is the one and only time Exxon will face the
respect of punitive damages.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you don't have the
problem of litigant A getting these punitive damages and
than B, C and D all wanting to --
MR. FISHER: Right. One of the many ways in
which this case is the mirror image of the due process
cases that Justice Souter was referring to that caused
this Court to have such great concern about the uptick
in punitive damages, here you have a single case. You
have a single digit ratio which is proportionate to the
harm that was shown in this case.
You have -- in contrast to State Farm, in
the most recent -- second most recent case this case
had -- in State Farm you had two plaintiffs who stood
before this Court having received $500,000 each in
compensatory damages for the emotional distress of 18
months of not knowing whether an insurance claim was
going to be paid. What you have today are 32,000
plaintiffs standing before this Court, each of whom have
received only $15,000 for having their lives and
livelihood destroyed and haven't received a dime of
emotional distress damages.
If there are no further questions, I'll
submit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Fisher.
Mr. Dellinger, you have four and a half
minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. DELLINGER: Let me begin by noting that
it's -- I do not think the Court will find in the record
that Exxon said this was expected and approved the --
you can look at that excerpt on the DVD and see for
yourself what was -- what was meant by that.
With respect, it is difficult to decide what
level of employee should implicate a company; but it is
divisible I think, as Justice Kennedy suggested. It is
based on whether that employee has authority over the
policy, and even a ship captain may have authority over
some policies; he did not here. At the end of the day
what the Ninth Circuit held was that Exxon was liable --
could be liable for 2.5 billion, simply because against
its policies, Hazelwood left the deck. That's all that
we need to be found.
Now with respect to the -- with respect to
the amount of punitive damages here, where you are --
punitive damages cases generally look to for the need to
deter the activity where someone acts out of malice and
hostility, intending to harm, which is not true here; or
when a corporation acts out of a profit motive and hopes
perhaps it will be concealed or that it will make enough
money off of it. That is not true here. Exxon gains
nothing by what went wrong in this case, and paid dearly
for it.
In the criminal case, the U.S. and Alaska
agreed that the amount of the penalty was quote,
"sufficient to provide punishment and deterrence for the
conduct in question."
Now if you talk about the -- the amount
where you have that kind of deterrent, for an
unintentional act that -- of the amount that's already
paid, I heard no response to what one would say to
Justice Kennedy's opinion in State Farm as an outer,
outer limit. In State Farm the Court said where
compensatory damages are substantial, then perhaps --
this is the constitutional context -- perhaps an amount
equal to compensatories would be the most.
What was substantial there was 1 million
dollars. The compensatories here were 400 or 500 times
the -- what the Ninth Circuit found -- 504 million
dollars. Yes?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Just as a class, if you
take them individually, each individual, did Mr. Fisher
say 15,000 something?
MR. DELLINGER: Well, from the stand --
first of all, from the stand point of a company it
doesn't matter whether you pay one person 500 million
dollars or a lot of people 500 million dollars, in terms
of punishment and deterrence.
But also it is the case that -- that with
regard to the first plaintiff who had been fully
compensated, the argument would have been that in light
of all that happened, there is no need for punishment
and deterrence even in the first case, and certainly
cumulatively, when the amount ad reached, say the amount
of the civil fines of 80 million, one would have said no
more punitives, because the purpose of punitive damages
is a public purpose. It is not to compensate the
individual.
Here we're at 500 times what was considered
substantial in State Farm. I don't see -- and what is
that -- that part of State Farm is to be considered a
dead letter, how one could not see that this is the
case. But that -- that amount of compensatories is an
outer limit, because if you look to what the civil
penalties would be that responsible officials have
obtained, it is 80.2 million dollars; and when you look
to the fact that this is a case where, as Justice Breyer
notes, with the First Circuit opinion, outside the
fishing context there would have been no compensatories
paid at all, or owing, because it's consequential
damages and in most States, the great majority of the
States, that is not even a compensable -- a compensable
injury. But it is a special rule for -- for fishing.
So these are awards -- that would not have
been done in any case. This was a tragic and terrible
event, and one for which the company has paid dearly,
and the -- at the end of the day, the question will be
whether this Court without any guidance should assume
that there should a punitive damages remedy in areas
where Congress has already acted, and whether, if so,
the plaintiffs have made out any case of an additional
need for punishment and deterrence beyond what public
authorities have agreed to.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:38 a.m., the case in the
