CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 12-462, Northwest,
Incorporated v. Rabbi Ginsberg.
Mr. Clement.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Under this Court's decision in Wolens, there
are only two relevant questions here, and the Ninth
Circuit got both of them wrong.  The first question is
whether a claim for additional benefits under a frequent
flyer program, like flight upgrades, relate to prices,
routes, and services.
This Court answered that question in the
affirmative in Wolens and, indeed, underscored that the
question's not particularly close.  The Ninth Circuit's
ability to reach the contrary conclusion in the precise
same context underscores how far they have strayed from
this Court's precedence.
The second question is whether the
Plaintiffs' claim here seek merely to enforce the
parties' voluntary undertakings or, rather, seek to
enforce State law to enlarge those undertakings and
enlarge the parties' bargain.
And it's to that question 2 we think
Respondent's own claims here make the case quite clear.
Respondent did bring a claim here to enforce the
parties' voluntary undertakings, a breach of contract
claim, and lost on the merits.
The implied preemption claim is different.
It seeks to impose a duty of fair dealing and
reasonableness and superimposed that on the bargain,
even where the parties to the contract have essentially
given one party absolute discretion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Clement, the argument
was made that if -- if the airline has an unreviewable
right to terminate this agreement for any reason or for
no reason, if that is so, then it's an illusory
contract.
What -- what is your answer to that, if one
party can get out willy-nilly, why -- what kind of
bargain is it?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, there are a couple of
answers to that, Justice Ginsburg.  The first is I think
although the focus on whether a contract is illusory is
sometimes used as part of the analysis under the implied
covenant for a bilateral contract, I don't think that
same analysis would apply to something like a frequent
flyer program, which I think would be properly
understood as a unilateral contract, where you don't
worry about those sort of illusory promises.
The second thing is I think you have to
understand in the context --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did a unitary contract?
MR. CLEMENT:  I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure I
understand that point.
MR. CLEMENT:  There -- there is a
distinction, if you go back to the Horne books on
contract law between a unilateral contract and a
bilateral contract.
A unilateral contract is -- is a typical
sort of outstanding promise, that promise doesn't
require an exchange of consideration, and the party who
makes the promise has the ability to withdraw the
promise until there's -- there's performance,
essentially, relying on the promise.
And that's why I think it's actually a
little bit of a mistake to apply that doctrine to
something like a frequent flyer program.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I don't understand
that, Mr. Clement, because I always thought that the way
these agreements worked were there were agreements that,
if I flew a certain number of miles on your plan, I was
going to get a free ticket.
And -- and it wasn't a gift that I was
getting a free ticket, it was because I did something, I
flew a certain number of miles, so that there was an
exchange with value on both sides.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I -- I suppose you could
conceive of it that way.  You could also conceive of it
as, basically, being a premium that's offered by the
company to reward your loyalty, but you've already
gotten full performance.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  I think you have to
conceive of it that way, but that still makes it a
unilateral contract.  It's not a promise in exchange for
another promise.  It's a promise in exchange for the
performance of an act; that is, flying the
airline -- you know, a certain number of miles.
You're correct, it is a -- a unilateral
contract.  Now, whether that -- that means that there's
no -- is there no such thing as an illusory unilateral
contract?
MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think there really
is -- you know, I looked at the -- the treatises for
that, and I just don't think that concept really applies
in the unitary -- the unilateral contract context.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't -- I just don't see
why that would make sense because, if I knew that it was
really up to you to give me the free ticket, maybe I was
willing to get it and maybe I wasn't.  I don't think
that I'd be spending all this time in the air on your
planes -- you know, I'd find another company that
actually gave me the free ticket.
MR. CLEMENT:  And that, really, I think,
gets to the nub of this because, of course, what you're
suggesting is that there would be a market solution to
this problem.  And that's what the Airline Deregulation
Act is all about, letting the market decide these
issues.
So, if some airline really were crazy enough
to systematically turn on its most lucrative and loyal
customers, surely, the market would solve that.  And, of
course, if a bunch of airlines did it, the Department of
Transportation stands ready to police that.
But --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, usually, what we say
when a contract has no consideration, we don't say, oh,
we're going to hold you to it anyway because the market
will solve it.  We say the contract has no
consideration, it's illusory, in just the way that
Justice Ginsburg pointed out.
And the question is:  If there's really no
obligation on the part of the airline here to give that
free ticket, if they can do it when they feel like it
and not do it when they don't feel like it, why is there
any consideration?  Why isn't the contract illusory?
MR. CLEMENT:  There -- there is
consideration -- I'm not sure anything turns on this --
but there is consideration because this is not something
where the airline says, look, we can do anything we
want.
They say, look, if you present us with miles
while you're still in good standing in the program,
we'll give you upgrades, we'll let you into a lounge.
But if, pursuant to the contract, you abuse the program,
in our sole discretion, then you lose your membership
status.  And that's what's happened here.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you -- you're not
trying to enforce the contract anyway.  You -- you want
to get out of the contract.  So you -- you ought to be
happy to have it pronounced an illusory contract, right?
What do you care?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, that is true, but I
suppose the argument might be that you could, as a
matter of breach of contract law, use this principle to
interpret the contract.  And, if that were an argument,
it's an argument that's made under Count 1 of this
complaint.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Clement, you're
making -- you're making an assumption.  The claim here
is not whether he abused or didn't abuse the program.
His allegation is that the only reason you terminated
with a contract was because you wanted to get rid of
these high flyers in your merger negotiations with the
other airline.
That's the same as saying, they didn't
terminate me because I abused the program, they
terminated me because I was of a certain race, or I was
a woman, or I was handicapped, or some other improper
consideration.
So are you suggesting that this contract
permits you to use that kind of self -- that kind of
ground, one not grounded in the contract, but grounded
in your whim and caprice?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, a couple of points,
Justice Sotomayor.  First of all, I think it's -- it's
really important to emphasize that the claim about
pretext and this all being about the merger is actually
not something that's made in the breach of contract
count or the breach of implied covenant count.  That's
pled, actually, in the misrepresentation counts,
Counts 3 and 4 of the complaint, that everybody
recognizes are preemptive.
Now, what's pled in contract Count 1, the
breach of contract count, is that, under the contract,
somehow, we don't have the ability to terminate somebody
without just cause.  And that's the argument that the
district court rejected on the merits.
Now, the implied covenant count, Count 2, is
different.  It says that, under State law, there is a
duty of good faith and fair dealing, and that duty is
superimposed on the contract, even if the contract gives
one of the parties absolute discretion.
And those aren't my words.  Those are the
words of Count 2 of the complaint at Joint Appendix page
51.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even if you have
absolute discretion, isn't there a limit to that?  Isn't
there a limit of reasonableness to that absolute
discretion?  That's the whole question of -- otherwise,
you have a contract with no substance.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, the way I would think
about it, Justice Sotomayor, is "absolute" might not
quite mean absolute, and the place to make that argument
is under the breach of contract rubric; that, you can
cite Cardozo and Lady Duff-Gordon.
But when you get to saying, even if the
contract's absolute, State law still superimposes a
reasonableness requirement on the contract, that's the
point at which preemption kicks in.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that entirely -- I mean,
suppose the contract said, "in its absolute discretion
and subject to no obligation of good faith."  Suppose it
said that.  Would State law still impose an obligation
of good faith?
MR. CLEMENT:  It might well, Justice Scalia,
because --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it might well, or it
would?  I mean --
MR. CLEMENT:  It depends on the State.  So
the majority --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, this State, I mean,
the State we're talking about.
MR. CLEMENT:  Okay.  Minnesota.  I -- as I
read the cases, the rule in Minnesota is that the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not waivable.
So there's a case that we found called New
Amsterdam Casualty.  It's in the indemnity context, so I
assume that -- and it says that in the indemnity context
a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not
waivable.
So I don't think you could do that, which I
think underscores that this is not the parties agreeing
to this.  This is having this condition superimposed on
them by State law.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is the choice we have here
only between State law and no relief?  Or is there some
theory under which either Federal common law or an appeal
to the DOT could give the flyer, the customer, some
relief?  And -- you know, we can all think of crazy
hypotheticals.
Suppose the phone rings, and he says, I'm
John Doe, I want to talk to you about my airline, you've
miscalculated.  They said, Mr. Doe, we've heard from you
15 times, you're -- you're out of this program.  It's a
mistaken identity.  There are two John Does.  Can the --
can the innocent, good-faith John Doe do any -- anything
at all?
MR. CLEMENT:  Yes.  The -- the good-faith
John Doe can do two things.  One, as your question
suggested, he can go to the DOT.  The DOT has the
authority to investigate complaints about frequent flyer
programs.  It exercises that authority.  It's discussed
at pages, I think, 20 and 21 of the SG's brief.  They
heard something like 289 of these complaints last year.
So that's -- so that's one place you can go.
The other place you can go in a case ofmistaken identity -- I
mean, if you followed up and,
certainly, if you went so far as to bring a routine
breach of contract claim, I assume that would get
addressed in that forum because airlines are not in the
interest -- do not have an interest in getting rid of
their most lucrative and loyal customers.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but -- in part of
that suit, wouldn't you have to -- the judge says,
what's the underlying substance, and you say, well,
there's a duty of good-faith dealing under Minnesota
law.  And then you're right back where you started,
unless there's some -- unless there's some Federal
common law with Lincoln Mills or something like that?
MR. CLEMENT:  No, I don't think there's
Federal common law.  This Court, I think, essentially
rejected that in Wolens.  I'm making a more practical
point, which is in a real case of mistaken identity, I
think that would get sorted out in the process,
certainly at the point where a breach of contract action
was brought.
Because, again, if there's -- if there's a
John Doe who really is a frequent flyer --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I still don't
understand the substantive basis for the breach of
contract suit, if you say we can't refer to State law.
MR. CLEMENT:  You can refer to State law for
the breach of contract.  You can't, we would submit, add
the implied covenant of breach of good faith because
that enlarges the bargain.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Clement, suppose
that this complaint only had one count.  And suppose
that they had said, look, we have this contract, and it
gives very substantial discretion, it gives -- you know,
by the words alone, it gives absolute discretion to
Northwest.  But that can't really be right because
contracts have this implied covenant of good faith.
There's an implied duty to perform in good
faith.  And that means that this discretion is narrowed
in certain kinds of ways, that they can't terminate my
membership for certain kinds of reasons, and that's all
the complaint said.  There was just this one count.
Do you think that would be preempted?
MR. CLEMENT:  I think the reliance on the
implied covenant in that context should be preempted.  I
think that's the better rule.
If this Court wanted to adopt a narrower
rule and say, look, it's really at the point that you
try to bring a separate implied covenant claim, that's
preempted, I suppose, as a matter of adminstrability,
you could do that.  It might make some sense, because --
I mean, you do have to take a practical look at this.
In the wake of Wolens, if you plead a
routine breach of contract claim, you're going to avoid
preemption.  The only reason, practically, you run the
risk of preemption by pleading a separate claim is when
you're trying to really get outside of the terms of the
contract.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess what I'm suggesting
is that the implied covenant here, it's just an
interpretive tool.  It says that there are certain kinds
of provisions that are written very broadly or very
vaguely, and an implied covenant comes in to help us
interpret those kinds of provisions.
And, viewed in that way, it's just a
contractual device that, in light of Wolens, ought to be
permitted.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, here's my thought on
that, which is I think even the Respondents admit that,
in some States, the implied covenant is much more than
simply a rule of construction for the explicit terms of
the contract.
And I suppose, if this Court wants to say
that the only way the implied covenant is not preempted,
is when it's just a rule of construction for the
explicit terms of the contract, I suppose we could live
with that rule, and I think we'd certainly win in this
case.
The reason I would suggest that the better
rule for this Court to adopt is that the implied
covenant should just be preempted, even in that
circumstance, is because, in that circumstance, it
doesn't add anything.
If it really is just a rule of construction
for the express terms of the contract, you could get in
the same place with the citation to Cardozo and Lady
Duff-Gordon.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, could you
tell me where you think they concede that some States --
that their position would lead to a different result in
some States?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I'm not -- it's -- it's
in the Red Brief, and I think it's quite clear.  I think
they -- they say -- I'll try to find the -- the point
where -- where I find this rebuttal.  But I don't think
the -- they do this.  They basically say that some
States do apply this rule.  They say that our claim is
different.
And I'll get you the exact page.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought they were
saying that, in some States, it's not an implied term of
the contract, but a different sort of provision.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I may have misspoke.
What I meant is I think both parties agree, as they
would have to, that, in some States, the Implied
Covenant Doctrine is used to directly impose public
policy.  And so, in Alaska, that seems to be the case.
In Montana, that seems to be the case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about Minnesota?  In
Minnesota, isn't it just a rule of construction of the
contract?
MR. CLEMENT:  We don't believe so, Your
Honor.  I think -- I'm not going to try to tell you that
Minnesota law is pellucidly clear on this.  But
Minnesota -- the Minnesota Supreme Court case -- the
Hennepin case that adopts -- recognizes the implied
covenant, cites the Restatement.
The Restatement quite clearly embraces a
view of the implied covenant that goes beyond merely
constructing the express terms of the contract.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it the case that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I still -- I still have
this problem.  You say don't -- now, don't worry, you
can always bring an express contract action.  And I say,
well, what law do you apply?  Well, you -- you have no
State law, and there's no Federal common law.  I don't
understand how you can bring an action with no
substantive law to inform it.
MR. CLEMENT:  I may have misspoke, Justice
Kennedy.  The breach of contract claim that you bring --
the routine breach of contract claim you bring is a
State law claim, so we don't have any quarrel with Count
1 of this claim, which views Minnesota State contract
law to interpret the express terms of the contract.
Where we have a beef is with Count 2 of the
complaint that says, even if the contract gives the
parties absolute discretion, we are going to superimpose
a duty of good faith and fair dealing.
And, to complete the answer, since Minnesota
has adopted the Restatement, the Restatement suggests
that the way you find good faith is you exclude the
possibility of bad faith, based on community standards
of fairness and decency.
And, at the point that you're applying
community standards of fairness and decency, it seems to
me, quite clear, that you are not applying the parties'
self-imposed undertakings, but something else.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I suppose you could
say that it is assumed that parties to a contract
comport with community standards of fairness and
decency -- you know, you can wiggle to there, if you
want.
MR. CLEMENT:  You could try to wiggle there.
And my point would be the way to try to wiggle there is
interpreting the express terms of the contract.  An
implied covenant is different.
And I think if you take a step back and
think about this context:  When an airline reserves to
itself the sole discretion to make a judgment about
frequent flyers or about taking an unruly passenger off
a plane, do you really want State courts applying
community standards of decency to judge that, or is that
something that should be judged by a complaint to the
Department of Transportation?
If I could reserve the remainder of my time?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Yelin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS S. YELIN,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. YELIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
In Wolens, this Court recognized that
Congress enacted the ADA to leave decisions concerning
airline prices, routes, and services to the business
judgment of air carriers, subject to market forces and
limited oversight by the Department of Transportation.
In light of that statutory purpose, Wolens
held that claims based on the State common law of
contract are not preempted by the ADA to the extent they
seek to enforce the voluntary undertakings of the
parties.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if you had a
decision by the Minnesota supreme court on common law
contract principles and it said -- you know, when the
parties use the word "sole" in a contract, we interpret
that to mean subject to reasonableness constraint.  The
parties here use the word "sole."
Would the application of that principle
violate -- would that be preempted or not?
MR. YELIN:  In that context, I think not.
It depends on what the Court meant by the term
"reasonable."  If the term "reasonable" incorporates
external standards, such as community --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, "reasonable"
means -- I mean -- you know, the -- the airline says
"sole" means sole.  We don't have to explain why we did
it.  And the Minnesota court said, no, when you say
"sole," it has to be reasonable.  It can't be, for
example, for no reason.  It has to be for some
articulated reason.
MR. YELIN:  Yes, I understand,
Chief Justice, thank you.  But I think "reasonable" can
have different focuses.  It could be reasonable in light
of the expectations of the parties at the time that they
formed the contract, or it could be reasonable in light
of community standards of decency, which are --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's say
going forward.  Going forward, the parties know that
this decision is out there, and they say, "sole."  So it
means they're using the term, subject to the gloss
that's been put on it by the Minnesota supreme court.
So what about in that case?
MR. YELIN:  I think subsequent -- if there
is a gloss where -- and the -- I think that would be a
question of what the parties intended with the contract,
and I think there may well be an argument under that
scenario, that the airline understood that the gloss was
going to be given, although I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We would assume,
then, that the parties knew, whenever they used the word
"sole," they actually meant subject to reasonableness as
interpreted -- interpreted by the Minnesota supreme
court.
MR. YELIN:  I think that may well be right,
Your Honor, but I -- I want to caution that an argument
like that can prove too much.  An argument like that
could suggest, as Respondent argued in the lower court,
that, any time a party enters into a contract, the party
endorses or at least accepts all normative principles of
contract law.
That would include things like doctrines of
unconscionability and other doctrines that impose
extracontractual limitations on the parties' choices.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're not going
to give me "reasonable" for anything?
MR. YELIN:  No, no.  I absolutely am going
to give you "reasonable."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.
MR. YELIN:  I think it just --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if you're
going to give me "reasonable" -- in other words, the
parties' express terms do not say "reasonable"; in fact,
the most natural reading is that it's not reasonable,
but they take the contractual -- the interpretation that
the Minnesota supreme court has adopted, I don't know
why the same rule wouldn't apply when the Minnesota
supreme court says there is an implied condition of
reasonableness across -- across the board and that the
parties contract against that background, just like they
do when there's a specific interpretation of the word
"sole."
MR. YELIN:  I think the problem, Chief
Justice, is that the notion of the doctrine of the
implied covenant is extraordinarily broad and
encompasses a number of different concepts.  It
encompasses notions of reasonableness and implying
limitations to discretionary grants of authority
reserved in contracts.
It also encompasses, in some States,
concepts, such as notions of fairness, or which extend
beyond the intent of the parties.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me change the
hypothetical slightly.  Suppose the contract says that
one of the parties reserves sole discretion to do
something, and then the contract goes on to say, and
then, in exercising this discretion, we don't promise to
act in a reasonable manner.
But the State court says that, nevertheless,
that has to be interpreted to mean that the -- the party
can only perform in a reasonable manner.  Then what
would the situation be?
MR. YELIN:  I think the ADA would preempt
exactly that sort of claim or a claim based on that sort
of an argument.  The -- the crux of the ADA is to leave
to the judgment of air carriers, subject to market
forces, decisions concerning rates, routes, or services.
And I'd like to underscore this point by
pointing out that the interpretation that this Court
gives to the ADA is not only going to control frequent
flyer programs; it's also going to control things like
contracts of carriage, which are --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's right.  All right.
But, now, the question I have, which is, I think, for
anyone who wants to answer it, particularly the
government, I absolutely agree with you that -- that a
free market in price is at the heart of the Deregulation
Act.  Given.
I also think frequent flyer programs are
simply price discounts.  Given.
I also think that, if you don't have
contracts, you can't have free markets.  Given.
But I also think that the State cannot, under the
guise of contract law, regulate the prices of airlines.
If you allow that, you're going to have worse than we
ever had.  It'll be 50 different systems, all right?
So, if I think those four things, what
standard do I use to separate when a State is and when
it is not using its contract law to regulate prices?
MR. YELIN:  Justice Breyer, I heartily
endorse each of the four criteria you identified.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, good.  Then you'll
give me the answer because what I'm missing is what the
standard is.
(Laughter.)
MR. YELIN:  And I think the standard that
this Court could adopt and make very clear is that any
contract doctrine which seeks to interpret the intent of
the parties at the time of the contract's formation is a
valid standard to be applied in any suit and is not
preempted by the ADA.
But any contract doctrine like
unconscionability and like, in some States, some
instances of the doctrine of the implied covenant, which
seeks to impose extracontractual terms, like community
standards --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said, "in some
States."  So what about the States where that doesn't?
Are you saying that, in some States, the implied
covenant is assumed to be what the parties agreed upon,
and, in some States, it's not?
MR. YELIN:  Justice Ginsburg, I think
there's a continuum.  The -- the notion of the implied
covenant, as Justice Scalia explained for the D.C.
Circuit in the Tymshare decision, is a label with
many -- that encompasses many meanings.
Some States, like Illinois and Connecticut,
use the doctrine purely, it appears to us, as an
interpretive device to discern the intent of the
parties.  Other States at the other end of the
spectrum -- Arizona is one -- we've cited a number of
other cases in our brief -- used the same concept to
encompass extracontractual principles.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the State --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't want to have to
sort those out State by State.  I mean, it seems to me
the -- the regime proposed by the Petitioner is -- is
much more manageable.  If it goes beyond the words of
the contract, it -- and you're reading into it something
that it doesn't say, it's a matter of State policy, so I
can -- I can work with that.
But you're -- you're asking me to go through
each of the 50 States one-by-one to decide, oh, which --
which of these are really trying to discern the intent
of the parties and which ones aren't, I -- especially
since you discern the intent of the parties by simply
saying, well, parties intend to apply community
standards, right?
And there'll be different community
standards in every State, presumably.  Some States are
more honest than others, right?
MR. YELIN:  Justice Scalia, I have two
responses to that observation.  The first is I don't
think the State-by-State analysis is either unusual or
difficult.  There has to be a State-by-State analysis
any time you -- you have a contract claim applying State
law.  There are variances among States in their contract
law.
The -- the second part of the same response
is, I don't think the standard that we're articulating
is a particularly different one.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There are variances, but
not variances in such an ineffable question as to
whether this is really an effort to discern the real
intent of the parties or, rather, whether it's an intent
to impose community standards, especially since, as I
say, parties intend to adopt community standards,
usually.
MR. YELIN:  With respect, Justice Scalia, I
think that's not at all a difficult question.  I think a
contract -- I think it's unlikely that a frequent flyer
contract or any airline contract that reserves
discretion is likely to have incorporated, implicitly,
community standards.
I think the point would be that, if a
carrier were to decide to -- to incorporate ineffable
standards, such as that, it would have been pretty clear
in any reservation --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I give you -- I'm
quoting the Minnesota --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's easy for you --
for you, representing the government, but suppose you
were representing the airline.  Would you come up here
and say, the airlines want it to be well known that we
don't have to be reasonable?  I -- I find that very
difficult to understand.
MR. YELIN:  I -- I have one principal
response, Justice Kennedy, which is this:  If the Court
were to adopt a prophylactic rule along the lines that
Petitioner was suggesting, we think that would be better
than an alternative prophylactic rule in the other
direction because it would cut off the use of the
Implied Covenant Doctrine that would impose
extracontractual limitations.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we had --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I do agree, it seems
pretty inconsistent with the normal presumption against
preemption that we apply out of respect for the State
legal regimes, to say we're going to adopt a broad
prophylactic rule.
MR. YELIN:  This -- this is, in part,
precisely why we propose that the Court look -- adopt a
standard, which we don't think would be particularly --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So let's go back to a
simpler standard.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You -- go ahead.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My simpler standard
comes from quoting Hennepin.  "Does the implied covenant
claim extend to actions beyond the scope of the
underlying contract, or can it override the express
terms of an agreement?  If the answer is no, it's not
preempted."
Is that an okay statement.
MR. YELIN:  That is an okay statement.
We --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, if that's what
Minnesota law says, it's okay, and it's not preempted.
MR. YELIN:  With the following caveat,
Justice Sotomayor:  In some States that have adopted the
implied covenant, they have hybrid approaches where they
not only look to the intent of the parties, but also
impose external standards.
The standard --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you.
MR. YELIN:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Rosenbaum.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADINA H. ROSENBAUM
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
Northwest claims that the World Perks
contract allowed it to terminate Rabbi Ginsberg's
membership and take away the miles he had already
accrued in reliance on the frequent flyer program
contract; that is, that it allowed it, for any reason or
on any whim, to deprive him of all of the benefits of
the frequent flyer program contract bargain.
Our position, in contrast, is that
Northwest's actions breached its obligations under the
contract, specifically the contractual obligation to
perform in good faith.  Because this is a question of
contract interpretation, Rabbi Ginsberg's claim is
not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What was the lack of
good faith that you are claiming?  If they thought he
was abusive, or are you saying -- what are you saying
was the bad faith, what action?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  The action was terminating
him from the program and taking away his miles --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It can't be that --
MS. ROSENBAUM:  -- without possible cause.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- because there has to
be -- what are you saying was the bad cause here?
Assume their answer, that he was abusing the program.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Well, we do not think that
he was abusing the program.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's --
MS. ROSENBAUM:  And the allegations in the
complaint are that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you are doing exactly
what he is saying.  You are saying that their judgment
of abuse is not enough.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  We think that there is
some -- there are some reasons that he could not be
terminated from the program for, and there are
allegations in the complaint that are incorporated into
the covenant of good faith claim in the complaint, that
he was terminated because of the merger between Delta
and Northwest.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  As I understand your
argument -- correct me if I am wrong -- he could be
terminated without reasonable cause if he happened to be
from a State or if the suit was brought under the
governing law of a State, which imposed this obligation
of good faith as a matter of law.
The State says, regardless of what the
contract says, even if it says, in its sole discretion,
without any obligation of good faith, even if it says
that, as a matter of law, there is an obligation of good
faith.
As I understand your case, you acknowledge
that, in that State, he would simply be out of luck.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I don't think so.  Well,
that he would be out of luck --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He would have no cause of
action because this is, obviously, not an interpretation
of the contract; it is -- it is an imposition of a State
requirement.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  We agree that, if it's not
construing the contract, that if a State --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  I just --
MS. ROSENBAUM:  -- were, instead, claiming
that the contract violated the law, instead of
that Northwest had violated the contract --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wow, somebody's really been
given a raw deal -- you know, that's still going to be
possible, even if we rule for you here.  It depends on
what State he's from, right?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Well, States tend, in
applying the covenant of good faith, to apply it in --
as a contract interpretation tool, as a way of giving
effect to the benefits of the bargain.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Some do; some don't.  Some
do; some don't.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  The vast majority of
States -- and there is an appendix to the States' brief
on this issue -- talk about the covenant of good faith
as a way of interpreting the contract.  And Minnesota --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me ask you this:
Suppose you have, in Minnesota or one of the States
where you say the covenant is simply a way of
effectuating the intent of the parties, you have a
contract between two very tough and nasty businessmen.
And they write right in their
contract -- you know, we're going to comply with the
literal terms of this contract, but we do not promise
each other that we're going to proceed in good faith or
that we are going to deal with each other fairly.  We
are going to take every advantage we can under the
literal terms of the contract.
Now, would that get rid of the covenant
under Minnesota law?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Generally, the covenant of
good faith cannot be waived -- you know, I think the
question of whether the principle that the covenant
can't be waived is, itself, an external principle of
law, is a much harder question than the question here,
of whether the covenant itself --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, counsel, if it can't be
waived, it sure seems as though it is operating
independently of the parties' reasonable expectations.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Again, I think you need to
separate out the principle that it can't be waived from
the underlying principle of what the covenant is doing,
which is giving effect to the bargain that the parties
entered into, based on looking at the reasonable
expression -- the reasonable expectations of the
parties.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In Wolens -- and this is
a case that you rely on and that allowed room for
contract claims -- the expression was "self-imposed
undertaking."  And the airline says, we didn't impose,
we didn't take on this obligation, but the law reads it
into every contract, whether we want it or not.
How is it self-imposed if the party has no
say, that it's going to apply anyway?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Well, the terms of the
contract are the self-imposed undertaking, and then this
is a tool that's being used to understand and
interpret the tools of the -- terms of the contract and
then to enforce them.
And this is a widely used tool to interpret
terms of contracts, particularly when there are
discretionary terms within a contract.  That's something
that's done in the vast majority of the States, and, in
fact, the discretionary -- the cases where there are
discretionary terms within a context is the
quintessential application of the covenant of good
faith.
A lot of the early covenant of good faith
claims involved outputs or requirements contracts, where
the specific amount in the contract was not set, and the
covenant was applied to that sort of situation.  And
scholars, in talking about the covenant, often
specifically note that it applies to discretionary
terms.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how do you account for
the fact that, in many States, the covenant of good
faith and fair dealing is read into most contracts, but
is not read into employment contracts?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I think that that's a
situation that States struggle with, given the at-will
employment doctrine, and they've viewed the covenant and
the at-will employment doctrine as being in conflict
with each other.
Here, though, the covenant and the contract
or any other principle are not in conflict with each
other.  The covenant is not being used to override any
terms in the contract.  It is being used to help give
meaning to the terms in the contract and to identify
what the implicit restrictions are.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, doesn't that
discrepancy show simply that the State has different
policies with respect to those two types of contracts?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I -- I don't think that it's
applying different types of policy.  I think it's
interpreting the contract and what the contract means
differently in different situations.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, it might be, right,
because people have different expectations in those two
different situations and that the at-will employment is
so pervasive and so customary and so sweeping that the
policy -- the rule of an implied covenant of good faith
doesn't apply there because we think everybody expects
it not to apply there.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Exactly.  And I do think
that courts will, sometimes, say the covenant doesn't
apply when what they mean is that, if the covenant did
apply and the court were looking at the reasonable
expectations of the parties, based on the contract,
there would be no reasonable expectations --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, an at-will employment
contract is a contract that gives the employer sole
discretion as to whether to retain an employee.  And,
here, we have a contract that says that the airline
has -- has sole discretion to determine whether to
terminate somebody from the frequent flyer program.  So
what is the difference?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Well, it's a difference in
the context, and what the term "sole discretion" means
in different contexts is going to vary based on the
context and based on what someone entering into that
contract reasonably would have expected that contract to
mean, based on the terms of the contract.
So in the employment context, an employee,
given the wide acknowledgment of the at-will employment
doctrine, might not expect that they could only be
terminated for cause.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you would -- you
would agree -- it's the same question I asked the
government.  I would like your answer.  I imagine that
you would agree that a State says the following:  We
read into -- like common law courts used to do all the
time, for a transportation company, we believe the price
must be fair and reasonable, and a contract in our
State, for transportation prices, has to set a fair and
reasonable price, and I personally think many fares are
not reasonable.  They are too high.  All right.  And,
therefore, we have substituted the judges and the States
for setting prices instead of the parties.
All right.  You agree that would be
preempted?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  We agree that that does
not --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, so what is
your standard for distinguishing what is and is not
preempted where the State uses its contract law to imply
a fair and reasonable term?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I think our standard is very
similar to the one that the United States said.  It's
about whether the covenant is going to -- whether the
claim is looking at whether the parties breached the
contract or whether it's looking at whether the contract
itself violated the law.
So it's a question of whether the claim is
actually interpreting the contract and trying to get at
what the parties -- what their agreement was or whether
the claim is really that the contract, as the parties
agreed to it, violated the law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the supreme court
of the State had an opinion that says, we're going to be
candid about this, the covenant of fair dealing and good
faith, it's not in this contract, but we will read it
into every contract; that is, if the State supreme court
said, it's externally imposed, this is a rule that we
will read into every contract because of the policy in
our State that people should deal with each other
fairly.
Suppose that was the controlling decision of
the Minnesota supreme court.  Then you're out; is that
right?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Yes.  If a State says that
it's imposing external notions of policy, that would
fall on the other side of the line drawn in Wolens,
which looked at enforcing terms of the agreement versus
imposing external State policies, but that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  That would be weird, isn't
it, because in such a State, there might be a contract
where the parties reasonably did expect this implicit
term that limits something -- a very broad conferral of
discretion to operate.
And, yet, just because this State supreme
court has framed its argument in a particular kind of
way, they don't get the benefit of that.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I think it would depend on
how the claim was framed and how the court interpreted
that claim and whether, in interpreting that claim, the
court was looking at the reasonable expectations of the
parties based on the terms of the contract and based on
their desire to be bound by an enforceable contract or
whether it thought it was imposing -- overriding the
parties' contract and imposing external notions of
fairness.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that's no
clearer than the -- the government's view, and it seems
to me to be a particular problem when you're talking
about the objectives of the ADA, to say that the rule
varies from State to State, particularly since, of
course, we're dealing with airlines that go to a lot of
different States.
I mean, it seems to me that the loosest
State, from the point of view of the preemption, is
going to set the standard.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I don't think that -- that
the rule itself is varying from State to State.  I think
that the rule would be the same across States, that when
a claim is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.  It's a general
rule that it depends upon the particular circumstances.
That's the same rule, but in its application, it
certainly varies from State to State.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I don't think that it
necessarily would because, in all the States, a claim
that's seeking to get at the expectations and intents of
the parties would not be preempted, whereas one imposing
external notions of fairness would.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That isn't what your --
your complaint that I think -- paragraph 56, which I
think is the key paragraph says, that the -- under
the -- the law is -- the contract law that you want to
enforce is, even where a party to a contract is given
absolute discretion, it must exercise that discretion in
good faith in a manner consistent with the reasonable
expectations of the other party or parties.
Now, that's, I think, what they're objecting
to because, there, it sounds to me like I go in
to -- you know, get a ticket, my reasonable expectation
is they're not going to charge me what they're going to
charge -- you know, I mean, it's unbelievable.  But
there -- but, you see, that's my reasonable expectation,
and I'm the other party.
And so that clause sounds as if you could,
under State contract law, govern the price according to
my reasonable expectation, namely, the consumer, that
might be a great idea, but I don't think that's the idea
behind this act.
That's what -- what -- that's what I just
read you.  So what do you say about that?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Well, I think there's a
difference between expectations, subjective expectations
and reasonable expectations.  And the concept of
reasonable expectations in the complaint is -- is an
objective standard of what -- based on this contract and
based on the context, what -- how the contract should be
interpreted and what implicit terms there are in the
contract that need to be interpreted and then enforced
and that can, in fact, be breached by the other party.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Rosenbaum, in -- in our
decision in this case, do you think we should apply the
presumption against preemption of State law?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I think you should apply the
presumption against preemption of State law because it
does apply.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the whole purpose of
the ADA was to preempt State laws.  I mean, I can
understand applying that presumption to other statutes,
which say nothing about preemption.  The whole purpose
of the ADA was to deregulate airlines, was to say there
was going to be no Federal regulation, let the free
market handle it, and there be will be no State
regulation.
And you want us to apply a presumption
against preemption to that statute?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I do think the presumption
applies.  I don't think it's necessary to any outcome in
this case because, whether or not it applies in Wolens,
this Court held that claims are about holding airlines
to the terms of their agreement are not preempted, and
that's what the covenant of good faith claim is about.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it's one thing to
read the terms in the agreement.  It's another thing to
say it's an underlying premise that good faith and fair
dealing will control.
Are you taking issue with the good faith and
fair dealings standard being amorphous, being
susceptible to different interpretations by different
judges, by different juries?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I think there is a fair
amount of uniformity across the States in how they
actually apply the covenant of good faith and in terms
of applying it as an interpretation of the contract, and
then, especially, in cases where one party is claiming
that all of their performance under the contract is in
their sole discretion and that they're free not to
perform under the contract at all -- you know,
essentially where the contract would be illusory in
applying the covenant specifically under those
circumstances to ensure that there is meaningful
performance that's required under the contract.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is an employment at-will
contract illusory?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I don't believe that's an
illusory contract.
But I think rather than it being important
whether there are specific -- whether specifically this
contract is illusory, I think the fact that one party is
claiming that it had no duty to perform under the
contract shows that the contract had reasonable implicit
limitations in it, that the parties would have
reasonably expected that they were contracting to there
being some sort of performance under the contract.
And, in fact, the principles at issue here
are remarkably similar to the principles that were at
issue in Wolens itself.  And this Court there recognized
that those were contract construction issues.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's because the
contract was silent.  Here, it isn't.  Here, the
contract, says "sole discretion."  In Wolens, the
question was retroactivity, and the contract said
nothing one way or the other about it.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Well, in Wolens, the
question was an express reservation of rights, and the
contract didn't say whether or not it applied
retroactively, so the question was whether there were
implied limitations on the express reservation of
rights.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would this contract produce
a different result if it did not contain the words "in
its sole discretion"?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  The interpretation of the
contract might be different, but the reasonable
expectations --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you'd -- you'd --
you'd still apply the very same doctrine of
reasonableness, right?  So the words "in its sole
discretion" become superfluous.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I think there may be a
larger amount of deference that's given to the airline,
in that a party would reasonably expect would be given
to the airline, because of the sole discretion language.
And that's, obviously, a question for the merits, what
exactly is the meaning of the sole discretion language.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  I guess different
States will treat that differently as well, right?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I think the question is less
State-by-State and really more case-by-case and
context-by-context of what does sole discretion language
mean when used -- and where do you apply limitations on
it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I find -- I find it hard to
believe that you're doing nothing but interpreting a
contract when you -- you give it the same outcome,
whether it says "in its sole discretion" or does not say
"in its sole discretion."  I -- I find it hard to grasp
how what you're doing in that -- in that case is simply
interpreting the contract.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  I don't think that there
would necessarily be the same outcome in every single
situation, whether or not the claim -- whether or not
the contract said, "sole discretion" or not.  There may
be more deference given to the airline because of the
discretionary term; but, in both situations, the
question would be, what does this contract mean?
And contracts include both their express
terms and their implied terms, and the covenant of good
faith is going to interpreting those implied terms, to
identifying them within the contract, and then enforcing
them within the contract.
If an airline were able to just insert "sole
discretion" or "sole judgement" within its contract, it
would be able to entirely circumvent the rule that this
Court set forth in Wolens.  Just by adding "sole
discretion" to its contract, it would never be held to
any contractual duties or requirements.
JUSTICE ALITO:  May I ask you a question
about something slightly different?  An amicus brief
submitted in support of your position by California and
some other States points out, at some length, that there
are now a lot of frequent flyer programs in which a lot
of miles are earned by making purchases other than
for -- for flights and in which miles can also be spent
for things other than flights.
Do we have to worry about that in this case?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  We think that that's another
reason why this claim is not preempted, is because it
has to do with membership in a frequent flyer program,
rather than being -- rather than, like in Wolens, having
to do specifically with access to flights or --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what are the facts
relating to this particular plan?  Can you earn miles by
doing things other than flying?  Can you spend miles on
things other than flying?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  There are not very many
facts in the record about the plan, but the -- the
contract does refer to airline miles -- to -- sorry, to
airline partners from whom one could earn miles and then
use miles, also.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The plaintiff --
MS. ROSENBAUM:  And Delta, which is merged
into --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the plaintiff used
the frequent flyer program, whatever else it might be
used for, he used it to get lower prices on flights,
right?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  He did, yes, and that is
something in the record.  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why does -- it relates to
prices.  Even if you get credit for miles from staying
at certain hotels, it still has the effect of lowering
the price for your airline ticket.  And, likewise, if
you can use your frequent flyer miles to get cheaper
hotel rooms, that effectively lowers the price of your
airline ticket, doesn't it?
I mean, it doesn't seem to me to make any
difference whether -- whether the only thing you get
from the -- from the frequent flyer mileage is -- you
know, is airfares or other goodies.  They -- they are
all price.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  This is a claim just about
his membership in the program overall, and that is a
membership where there -- people who have the same claim
as him could be earning miles on their credit card,
spending miles on hotel rooms.
And, once there is a claim where someone can
bring it who has no relationship with air travel
whatsoever, where they can bring the exact same claim,
it's hard to see how that claim is related to prices,
routes, or services of air travel.
And there's certainly been no showing here
that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm sorry.  You are talking
about a situation where you can assign your -- your
mileage to somebody else who can get the hotel room?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  No, I'm saying
that someone --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The person who gets the
discount for the hotel room is the person who bought the
airline ticket, right?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Or the person who used their
credit card to receive frequent flyer miles.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your point is that you
can get frequent flyer miles by purchases other than
airplane transportation.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Yes.  And then also use them
for purposes other than airline transportation.
Reportedly, more miles are earned, now, on the ground
than on flight, through -- through means other than
travel than actually through --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't see anything in
the complaint about anything other than airlines.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  No, he himself --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there anything in your
complaint that talks about anything other than airlines?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  No, there isn't.  He --
Rabbi Ginsberg himself earned and used his miles --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I know.  But, I mean,
what we are taking about is what Count 2 of the
complaint says.  I think that's their objection.  But,
as far as Count 2 of the complaint says, it's about
airline miles, I take it, and airline miles are used on
airlines and -- et cetera.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Well, his claim --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if there is something
else in this complaint, tell me, and I will have to
figure out whether we go beyond the complaint.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  His claim is about his
membership in the program itself, and the program itself
can be used, including the accrued miles that are earned
under the program, can be used for purposes besides
airline flights.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Does it say that in the
complaint?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  It does not specifically
say, but the contract does refer to the airline partners
and this was decided --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And an airline partner, I
take it, is another airline?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  No, I think airline partners
can be the people with whom they partner with, to whom
they sell their miles.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So if I want to find out
about that in the record, where do I look?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  This was decided on a motion
to dismiss, so all there is, is the complaint, but there
is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All there is, is the
complaint, and it doesn't talk about it in the
complaint.  What I'm thinking about, obviously, is we
might reserve that question for another day.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  The complaint does include
the contract, that does refer to the partners, but does
not, I don't think, define exactly who the partners are.
But this Court doesn't have to reach the
question of whether or not the claim relates to prices,
routes, and services because it can decide this case
based on the line drawn in Wolens of whether or not this
claim enforces the terms of the -- enforces the terms of
the contract, which, under Minnesota law, the covenant
of good faith does.
Cases in Minnesota have referred to this as
a breach of contract claim.  And I want to respond to
Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What you say would apply to
other contractual obligations of the airlines, right?
So, if the airline says you have to get off the plane if
the flight attendant tells you to do so, there is going
to be a good-faith obligation attached to that, so you
can challenge -- challenge those decisions in court?
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Well, there are separate
regulations that apply to safety under the ADA, so --
and separate preemption doctrines that apply to safety
under the ADA.  But, besides that, this would apply to
matters besides -- to matters besides frequent flyer
miles and other sole discretion, issues in which the
contract leaves an issue to the sole discretion of the
airline.
I do want to respond to Justice Kennedy's
question about whether someone can go to the Department
of Transportation.  The Department of Transportation
does have authority over unfair and deceptive practices
that -- by airlines, but this is -- that's very
different than the claim that we're pursuing here.
That's a claim by -- by an airline -- sorry, by the
government, that doesn't give remedies to the specific
consumer who was hurt.
And that also looks at whether the practice
is unfair or deceptive.  And our claim here isn't that
this was an unfair practice.  The claim here is that
this is a practice -- or these were actions that
violated the contract, and what's being applied here are
contract law principles about interpreting the covenant
of good faith.
And the same thing was true also in Wolens.
At the time of Wolens, the Department of Transportation
had the same ability to pursue claims for unfair or
deceptive practices, but the Court recognized that that
did not override the need for there to be a contract
dispute resolution regime by -- by the State courts.
And that's the same -- the same is true here whether or
not the contract term at issue is expressed or implied.
And, overall, like in Wolens, this is a claim
where, if these sort of claims were preempted, it would
undercut the efficiency of contracts and the competitive
marketplace that overall the ADA meant to pursue.
People need to be able to rely on their contracts.  They
need to be able to rely on the fact that the other party
to their contract will interpret that contract in good
faith according to the reasonable expectations of the
parties where they will give them the performance they
reasonably thought that they were securing when they
entered into the contract.
Under Northwest's position here, though,
that it has the discretion not to perform at all, people
won't be able to rely on the security of their
contracts.  And it's hard to imagine that, when Congress
enacted the Airline Deregulation Act, it meant to
undercut the efficiency of contracts in that way.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't think it
helps your argument to say that your position promotes
the purposes of the ADA because the whole point of
that -- of the preemption provision, is that that's for the
Federal government to determine, not for different state
laws, what promotes the purposes of the ADA.
MS. ROSENBAUM:  Well, one thing this Court
said in Wolens was that having -- being able -- for
people to be able to trust their contracts was something
that promoted the purposes of the ADA.  And we think
that is true whether the terms that are being relied on
are expressed terms of contracts or, like here, the
implicit understood terms of the contract that the
contract is going to be performed in good faith.
Unless the Court has any other questions,
thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Three minutes, Mr. Clement.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
First, just a couple of loose ends.  The
concession that I was referring to before is on  15
and 16 of the Red Brief.  I think it was reiterated at
the podium.
Also, this argument that, somehow, frequent
flyer miles programs have changed or something and are
different because there are partners, the same arguments
were made by the plaintiffs in Wolens, in their brief to
this Court, that, somehow, these don't relate to prices
and routes and services because you have rental cars and
hotels as partners, so I think this Court has already
crossed that bridge.
Three --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't want to take up -- I
don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but, if the
facts were that, under a particular program, 90 percent
of the miles were earned by purchasing things other than
flying and 90 percent of the miles were spent on things
other than flying, wouldn't that be very different?
MR. CLEMENT:  I'm not sure it would be
different in a -- in a claim brought against the
airlines.  I mean, maybe if you want to sue the credit
card partner, the ADA has nothing to do with that.
But I would say that, if you're suing an
airline, the Airline Deregulation Act speaks to it.
But, if the Court want to reserve that, I suppose it
could.
I do want to make -- underscore that the
Implied Covenant Doctrine is very different from other
interpretative tools.  It is non-waivable, and, I think,
in a world where you are trying to determine the
difference between self-imposed undertakings and things
imposed by State law, non-waivability is a huge strike
against it being voluntary.
It also just is -- you can bring in separate
implied covenant claims -- you know, no one -- I've
never heard of a contra proferentem claim, but an
implied covenant claim is routinely brought as a
separate claim.
It just shows you really can enlarge the
bargain in very real ways, and the States make policy
decisions about whether to have it.  Texas doesn't have
implied covenants, as a general matter, at all.
Some States have a valid public policy.
They have different views about at-will employment
contracts.  And, when Congress wanted to impose a duty
of good faith and fair dealing on the franchise
agreements between car manufacturers and automobile
dealers, they passed a statute.  It's just statutory and
policy oriented in a way that normal rules of
construction are not.
Now, Justice Breyer, I certainly agree with
your four premises.  If I had to state a standard, I
would say the standard is that the implied covenant is
only not preempted when it does no more than provide a
rule of construction for the express terms of the
contract.
But, of course, if that's all it does, then
there's nothing to be gained by saying those claims are
not preempted because you can still just get to the same
place by citing Cardozo and Lady Duff-Gordon.
And there's a lot to be gained by adopting a
more prophylactic rule because the claims that are
brought in the real world are claims that I get a refund
even though the ticket's nonrefundable.  I get $1,000,
even though the loss limit was 500.  I get to sue you
for redirecting my packages, even though it was in your
sole discretion.
So in the real world, the implied covenant
claims are elastic and provide a basis for bringing the
kind of claims that courts have almost uniformly
correctly recognized are preempted.
The last question I ask you to think about
is:  Why is it the airlines don't put these covenants in
as express covenants?  Why do they say sole discretion
and not say sole discretion unless it violates
reasonable norms of community standards and decency?
Well, the reason is you can't run a
national, let alone international airline, if every one
of your judgments about taking an unruly passenger off
or taking out an abusive customer is going to be
second-guessed by a jury applying reasonable standards
of ordinary decency and morality.
So, for that reason, we think the judgment
below should be reversed, and we would urge you to apply
a more prophylactic rule.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
