CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
next in Case 10-9995, Wood v. Milyard.
Ms. Lord.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN A. LORD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. LORD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Tenth Circuit, after finding that
Mr. Wood's petition presented two substantial
constitutional claims, denied him habeas relief solely
on the ground that his petition was untimely. It did
this even though the State had done three things that
should have precluded this result: First, the State
deliberately relinquished a known statute of limitations
defense.
Second, in doing so, the State acted
strategically, not inadvertently.
And, third, in doing so, the State induced
the district court to expend substantial resources in
deciding claims of exhaustion and -- and deciding claims
on the merits.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, we asked for
two questions presented. The first was: Do court of
appeals have the power sua sponte to raise issues? And
in your reply brief, you appear to say, yes, they do in
some circumstances. So, are you conceding that that
power exists or that there is no power whatsoever?
MS. LORD: I'm proposing a clear line that
would divide situations in which the court of appeals
would have power and those in which it absolutely has no
power.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that a question of
power or a question of exercise of discretion?
MS. LORD: I would say it's a question of
power, and this is why: I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That seems sort of
strange. Both rely on a factual situation. Either you
can do something or you can't. That's power. If you
can do it sometimes, that's still power, and then the
question is, did you do it when you couldn't do it?
MS. LORD: Well, what I'm proposing is that
there are situations when it is never a proper exercise
of the appellate court's jurisdiction to consider sua
sponte a statute of limitations defense even in the
habeas context. And now --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's what we
said in Day, isn't it?
MS. LORD: Correct, that in Day the Court
said that courts -- "courts" -- it wasn't directed at
appellate courts, but no court would be free to
disregard a deliberate waiver of a statute of
limitations defense.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, all this fight is
about is whether there was a deliberate waiver or not?
MS. LORD: Well, that's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As opposed to power?
MS. LORD: That's our primary -- our primary
argument is that there was a deliberate waiver in this
case, and, given what this Court said in Day, the case
could be resolved on that narrow ground.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it is -- it is what
the -- swords are crossed over here because you say this
is a deliberate waiver, and the government says, no,
it's -- it's a forfeiture, and forfeiture -- if it's
forfeiture, then the court of appeals has discretion to
take it up. If it's a waiver, then Day makes clear --
so, it's a question of which box this case fits into:
Is it forfeiture or is it waiver? And your position is
it's waiver.
MS. LORD: That's correct, and my position
also is that there is an overlap between those boxes and
that when the statute of limitations defense is
forfeited in the sense of not being preserved in a
timely manner because of a deliberate choice, I mean --
and in this instance --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are there a lot of cases
raising the -- you know, the ambiguity that exists in
this case? I mean, if you tell me that's all this case
is about, I think we ought to dismiss this -- dismiss it
as improvidently granted.
MS. LORD: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't sit here to decide
whether when the government says, you know, we do not
concede it but we're not arguing it, or whatever the
language was -- we don't sit to decide factual questions
like that, that come up in a particular case.
I thought we took this case to decide the
more significant issue, on which there is a division in
the lower courts, as to whether there is, as you say,
power of the court to disregard the fact that a statute
of limitations defense has not been raised. We all
agree it wasn't raised. Now, whether it was forfeited
or not is another question. If that's all you want us
to decide, I don't want to decide that.
MS. LORD: Well, I clearly want a decision
that would favor my client. This --
(Laughter.)
MS. LORD: This Court granted cert on two
issues, and certainly this case presents the first
issue, which is whether a court of appeals, once the
State has had an opportunity to raise the statute of
limitations defense and chooses not to, whether the
court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Only the opportunity or
when it acknowledges -- in Day, we faulted the district
court for not telling the State, essentially, which we may --
not telling the State that it had a potential statute of
limitations defense.
Is it your position that if the State had
just been silent about the statute of limitations
defense and not raised it, that the court of appeals
wouldn't have power? Or is it your position that
because they knew they had the defense and didn't raise
it that the court of appeals didn't have power to sua
sponte raise it.
MS. LORD: Well, both -- the district court
ordered the State to announce --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not answering my
question.
MS. LORD: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the court of
appeals have the power to sua sponte raise it if the
State -- neither the court or the State addressed the
issue?
MS. LORD: Probably yes. Probably yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, it
doesn't have the power if the issue has been raised? Is
that your position?
MS. LORD: That's correct. If the stage of
the proceedings is after it was in Day, because in Day
when the issue arose under the Rules of Civil Procedure
and under traditional treatment of statute of
limitations defense, there was still time for the State
to announce we -- there was still time for the State to
change or to raise the statute of limitations defense.
Here --
JUSTICE ALITO: It sounds to me that what
you're -- what you're arguing is that the court of
appeals abused its discretion in viewing this as a plain
forfeiture, which you've just said would permit the
court of appeals to raise the issue sua sponte, instead
of a deliberate waiver. Is that what it comes down to?
MS. LORD: Or a purposeful forfeiture. I
mean, there are forfeitures by --
JUSTICE ALITO: They put it in the wrong --
they -- they abused their discretion by putting it in
the wrong box. They didn't put it in the forfeiture
box; they put it in the deliberate waiver box.
MS. LORD: Well, the way the court of
appeals handled it will create problems if it's approved
by this Court because --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, this is what -- this
is what troubles me about your argument that the court
of appeals abused its discretion. Is it correct that
you did not raise the issue of the court of appeals'
lack of authority to raise this sua sponte until
rehearing?
MS. LORD: What happened, Your Honor, is
that we were appointed at the certificate of
appealability stage, and we were ordered to brief
timeliness. Perhaps I took the order too literally. I
briefed timeliness, but I also set out exactly what
happened, which is in the briefs and which sets forth
the State's position.
The court itself raised Day and raised its
limited authority under Day to consider a statute of
limitations defense. They found, rather than a
deliberate waiver, which I believe the record supports,
that the State's comments were cryptic, and I will
stress --
JUSTICE ALITO: But youâ€™re -- but you're arguing
that the court of appeals abused its discretion by
failing to rule in your favor on an argument that you
didn't make?
MS. LORD: No. I -- the court was aware of
Day, and the court analyzed what it was doing under Day,
and it determined whether there was a deliberate waiver.
Once the court found there was a deliberate waiver, I
definitely challenged that finding. I -- there's a very
strong argument not included within the -- the -- the
questions presented, that this is a totally timely
petition. And it's only a -- it's a very difficult
argument, which is one of the reasons why it shows how
much the State's actions in the district court were
strategic.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you had two
opportunities at least to make the argument based on the
original postconviction motion, the 1995 postconviction
motion. You -- you did not raise that. You were silent
twice.
MS. LORD: Silent on the impact of the 19 --
we were not silent on the impact of the 1995 motion.
We've always said, and in fact the State has never
disputed, that that was a properly filed motion, and the
only issue was whether it was tolled -- whether it
tolled the statute of limitations period until 2004.
And the State realized that that issue -- if they were
to prevail on the timeliness issue, it was a very, very
difficult issue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then, I'm confused
because I thought that there was -- it was conceded that
the question was asked, did you file another
postconviction motion? Answer: No.
MS. LORD: I understand your question now.
When Mr. Wood was pro se, he filled out pro se motions,
and in those pro se motions, he did say that there --
and I'm talking about the 2004 motion -- he said there
was no prior postconviction motion.
And I believe he was confused because if you
look at the forms, both the Federal forms and the State
forms that show what a -- a defendant should check, it
makes it sound like a motion has to have been ruled on.
And Mr. Wood was pro se and simply confused. And no one
else was confused once the State entered their
appearance. They knew that the 1995 motion was still
pending. All they had to do was sit at a computer and
bring up the minute orders from the State, and they
could learn that.
So, the courts in making their rulings
always from the time -- and, you know, one of the
reasons why what happened was so strategic and so clear
is that the district court had initially dismissed
Mr. Wood's petition as untimely. And --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Lord, could I ask you
about the first question presented?
MS. LORD: Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN: As I understand the opposing
argument, it goes sort of like this: It says, in Day,
we said it's fine to do this in the district court.
Even if the party hasn't raised it, the court can raise
it on this exact issue. In Granberry, we said with
respect to a different issue that the appellate court
could raise it. And, in Day, we said that those two
issues were really the same.
So, that seems sort of like a logical
argument that just gets you to a place where you lose on
the first question, unless perhaps there's a difference
between a court raising a question sua sponte and a
court allowing a party to raise it later than the party
ought to have raised it. Are you relying on that
distinction, or are you questioning the logic of the
basic argument that Granberry and Day decided this?
MS. LORD: Both. And with respect to the
first argument about there being a difference between a
party presenting an issue and a court sua sponte raising
the issue, there is a difference. And the courts -- the
circuit courts do not always make that distinction and
do not always focus on that. For example, in Granberry,
it actually was a case where the party presented -- the
State presented on appeal the exhaustion issue, and the
court agreed to hear it even though the State hadn't
raised it below.
Here, you know, at least five times in our
joint appendix, you'll see the court saying that they
can't act as an advocate for Petitioner. And in,
fact, when the Petitioner, Mr. Wood, tried to raise an
-- the exhaustion issue again, the Tenth Circuit in its
certificate of appealability said he is bound by his
decision to dismiss these unexhausted claims,
notwithstanding his pro se status. And in the same
breath, the court of appeals resurrected the at least
concededly forfeited statute of limitations defense on
behalf of the State.
But I'd also like to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm a little confused.
You seem to be arguing that because the court of appeals
raised it before the party did, that that's worse than a
party raising it first. Is that your position? That
that -- that the court of appeals has more power after a
party who has forfeited below or waived below now tries
to come up on appeal and assert a defense that they
didn't assert below? Now the court of appeals has more
power?
MS. LORD: It raises different concerns. My
concern is not the relative power. It's that when a
court is raising something sua sponte, it defeats the
party presentation principle. That's one concern.
When the court is -- when the party raises
it after having forfeited, everyone concedes here that
they wouldn't be allowed to. So, in essence, what
happens is the court is acting as a super-advocate
for --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But those arguments were
rejected in Granberry and Day.
MS. LORD: Well, that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why should they win now?
MS. LORD: Well, and that was -- I was going
to -- I had a second part of my answer to Justice Kagan,
which is there's something really different going on in
Granberry and in Day, and you can't add the two and come
up with a neat package such as what's suggested by the
State.
And, in Granberry, of course, as the Court
all knows, the Court was dealing with exhaustion, and it
was dealing with exhaustion, which goes to the heart of
habeas and comity and all those concerns, at a time when
dismissing a case to exhaust claims -- all that would do
is delay Federal relief. It wouldn't eliminate Federal
relief.
And this Court in Rhines v. Weber recognizes
that when AEDPA -- AEDPA was passed, it transformed the
landscape, and it really made some changes. And whether
the -- the notion in Granberry that exhaustion can be
raised for the first time on appeal transfers to the
statute of limitations -- I think there's real doubt
about that, and I think that goes to an important
question and the question that the Court granted cert
JUSTICE KAGAN: But didn't Day say that
those two issues were functionally identical for this
purpose?
MS. LORD: Not for this purpose. And by
"this purpose" I mean the court of appeals' authority to
raise sua sponte the defense. In Day, this Court --
there were two prongs to Day. In the context of Day,
which was, you know, where the State had filed a Rule 5
response and patently erroneously calculated the -- the
limitations period, and the court noticed it, and
there's no law that required, as this Court held, the
court to muzzle itself and not mention you've
miscalculated these days.
We're in a totally different situation. And
the Rules of Civil Procedure allowed what happened in
Day. They don't allow what happened in our case.
And --
JUSTICE ALITO: What Rule of Civil Procedure
applies here? You're talking about appellate procedure
here. Is there a rule of appellate procedure that
governs this?
MS. LORD: I'm referring to Civil Rule of
Procedure 8(b) and 12.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they refer to what
happens in the district court, and Day dealt with that.
Now you're in the court of appeals. What rule is there
that addresses the situation in the court of appeals?
MS. LORD: Well, there's the traditional
rule that if you don't raise it, you lose it, when we're
talking about a statute of limitations defense. And
it's really key here because when AEDPA engrafted this
-year statute of limitations into the habeas
proceedings, it knew how 1-year statute of limitations
were treated. And, yes, in Day, quite correctly the
Court held that in that context you're going to treat
those defenses the same, especially with respect to Rule
, which would allow a court to dismiss a petition just
on its face.
JUSTICE ALITO: You made an argument in your
brief that I found a little difficult to follow, but --
so, maybe you can explain it. You seemed to suggest
that the State's position on timeliness in the district
court somehow induced your client to dismiss the claims
that were arguably not exhausted. And I found it
difficult to understand why the -- why your client's
strategy as to whether he wanted to dismiss those claims
or not would be affected by the State's position on
timeliness.
MS. LORD: Well, if the State had challenged
timeliness at the stage that AEDPA contemplates it
would, it would have created a real complicated issue on
abandonment, and I think the briefs suggest just how
complicated that is under Colorado law. And if that had
happened, the court very well could have, district
court, could have appointed counsel for Mr. Wood, I
mean, if there had been an evidentiary hearing, if, as
the Tenth Circuit found, the issue was so complex that
counsel was necessary.
So, once you had counsel, in the State's
reply or in its answer, they indicated that several of
Mr. Wood's claims were not exhausted. And some of those
claims were in that 1995 motion that was pending. With
counsel, there could have been a request for a stay and
abey. There could have been so much that was done.
Mr. -- but because the State chose to simplify the
proceedings -- that's what they did, and it was not
inadvertent; and it wasn't a mistake. They chose to make it
simple and to focus on exhaustion. So, they got four
claims dismissed on exhaustion grounds, and then they
dealt with the other two claims on the merits.
They also had a procedural default issue
which was totally unconstitutional. They were relying
on a procedural default that didn't exist at the time
you had to raise it.
But that simplified the proceedings, made it
more a question of law. Mr. --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what's wrong with
that? Why should we be penalizing the State for trying
to simplify an action and make it move more
expeditiously?
MS. LORD: Absolutely we should not. But we
also should hold them to that strategic choice, which is
what Day says you do. And we have to hold them to that
choice because there were consequences, and there were
changes of positions. And they got the benefit of going
forward and just looking at exhaustion. They eliminated
the risk of an evidentiary hearing. They eliminated the
risk of a lawyer. They induced Mr. -- and I -- they
induced Mr. Wood to dismiss four claims because -- oh,
sorry. Because -- I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. Keep going
with your --
MS. LORD: No -- because he was assured that
he could go forward on two substantial constitutional
claims without worrying about time bar, because the
State said that. They said twice we are not
challenging, we will not challenge, timeliness.
JUSTICE ALITO: That's what I don't
understand. I -- why -- you have two situations. One
situation, the State's raising timeliness. So, he says,
okay, they're raising timeliness; I'm not going to
dismiss my -- the claims that they say are not
exhausted. The other situation, they -- they don't say
anything about timeliness. And he said now I'm going to
dismiss the claims that are -- that they say are
unexhausted.
I don't understand the connection.
MS. LORD: Well, the connection is the State
guaranteed that they would not challenge timeliness, and
that allowed Mr. Wood to go forward on two
constitutional claims without ever having to worry that
they would be subject to time bar.
And when the court --
JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, I understand why that's
a benefit to him, but what is the connection between
that and the dismissal of the unexhausted claims?
MS. LORD: Oh. Because if they had -- if
they had challenged timeliness, they would have raised
this very complicated issue, because the only way they
can win on timeliness is to win on this newfangled
notion of abandonment under Colorado law, which under
Colorado law requires a hearing and requires factual
development.
And once they pursued in the district court
that claim of abandonment, it was very likely that a
lawyer would be appointed. That lawyer could see that
there were claims still pending in the 1995 motion and
could possibly have sought a stay and abey, could have
gone and tried to exhaust those claims, serious
constitutional claims that were in the 1995 motion.
And -- and maybe a better way of putting it
is if they had raised timeliness in the district court,
abandonment would have been front and center. And even
though the court of appeals ultimately resolved this
issue without an evidentiary hearing, that was an abuse
of discretion itself, too. It was totally contrary to
Colorado law, analyzing that issue.
It is no small thing that the position that
they took in the district court allowed Mr. Wood to go
forward on two claims, two constitutional claims that
are substantial that the court has granted a certificate
of appealability on.
This is -- this case is so unlike Day in the
sense -- if an appellate court can raise sua sponte the
statute of limitations in a case like this, it can raise
it in any case. It invites the State to take a position
in the district court which would be totally contrary to
AEDPA's desire for streamlined proceedings. It would --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Lord, an amicus brief
filed on behalf of 15 States contends that the Civil --
the Rules of Civil Procedure are not what should be
consulted here, because they govern only to the extent
that they're not inconsistent with habeas rules, and
asserts that the -- the habeas rules should rather apply
and that they -- that they cut against your case.
Do you have a response to that? Was it --
was it in your reply brief or --
MS. LORD: It may be. I believe in some of
the briefs what I've said is there is no inconsistency
between Rule 5's requirement that the defense be set
forth and the traditional recognition that statute of
limitations is lost if not raised. And I cited the
Court to Jones v. Bock, which stresses that, for mere
policy reasons, we shouldn't deviate from the rules that
would otherwise apply. And I think --
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the screening function
that the -- that a district court performs in the habeas
case inconsistent with the traditional rule about
raising affirmative defenses?
MS. LORD: Well, that's the district court,
and that's one of the key differences between the
district court and the appellate court. The appellate
court can issue a certificate of appealability. The
district court has that prescreening function, which is
just like the prescreening function in the PLRA, where
this Court looked at a circuit's attempt to create rules
that would address policy concerns and deviated and put
an enhanced pleading requirement on prisoners and said,
I believe unanimously, that that shouldn't be done.
There's a real virtue in having a
predictable rule. There's a real virtue in letting the
States or -- letting the States know in the context of
this Court's Federal timing rules that they have to
raise it, the statute of limitations defense, when
they're ordered to and when Rule 5 requires them to.
You should not adopt the State's position
when it will just invite the sort of sandbagging that
this Court has taken care to avoid. You don't want
straddling by the State on something as important to
judicial efficiency as asserting the statute of
limitations in a timely manner.
I'll reserve the rest of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Domenico.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL D. DOMENICO
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. DOMENICO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In contrast to the new and fairly
complicated set of doctrines my friend asked the Court
to adopt today, this Court can resolve this case by
applying two straightforward longstanding rules.
First, in Granberry v. Greer, the Court
recognized that courts are not bound by a State's
failure to properly argue and preserve a procedural bar
to a habeas claim.
And, second, to the extent there is an
exception to that rule for deliberate waivers, the Court
should apply the common rule that a waiver must be
unequivocal.
By applying --
JUSTICE BREYER: Where --
MR. DOMENICO: Please.
JUSTICE BREYER: Where? What's the case
that supports you the most on that?
MR. DOMENICO: On the -- on the second
question? Well, that's a common rule. From
statutory rights such as in Olano --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, just give me a citation.
MR. DOMENICO: College Savings Bank is one,
probably the clearest case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Has to -- has to be what?
What's the word? "Unequivocal"?
MR. DOMENICO: Unequivocal is a common --
for waiver of everything --
JUSTICE BREYER: Because I'll look at the statute.
Now, I did look at Black's Law Dictionary, and Black's
Law Dictionary, looking up forfeiture and waiver, it
seems like you lose.
My analysis would be this: Forfeiture is
the "loss of a right" -- that's what's at issue --
"because of a crime." That doesn't apply. "Because of
a breach of obligation." That doesn't apply. "Neglect
of duty." Now, that does because you didn't file the
answer. Okay? So, that's forfeited.
Now you look over to waiver and, as you say,
it says "voluntary relinquishment of a legal right."
Okay, what's the legal right? The legal right is to get
the case dismissed.
So, I'm the judge. I say, State, do you
want to get the case dismissed? I just gave your
answer. Okay. I say you voluntarily relinquish your
legal right. Your legal right was to get the case
dismissed, and you relinquished it. You didn't assert
That said, that would be the difference.
And she's saying that. She's saying that makes a lot of
sense. When you read Day, they're worried about the
State doing something inadvertently, making a mistake.
So, what the judge says is: State, you know you have a
pretty good claim here on statute of limitations,
but you didn't assert it. So, I'm going to give you the
right to assert it. Go ahead, assert it even though
it's late. You overcome the forfeiture.
Now you say: I assert it, Your Honor.
Okay, you haven't waived it. Now you say: I don't
really care.
MR. DOMENICO: Justice Breyer, what the
State was doing here was not strategically trying to --
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no. I assume they
didn't do anything mean -- strategic; it wasn't a trick.
It was just what is it that they did? And what they did
is they were given the opportunity to overcome the
forfeiture, to assert the statute of limitations claim,
and they didn't do it. They didn't want to do it. I
don't know why they didn't want to do it, because there
was a lot of trouble raising other issues, dah, dah,
dah. But that's their business. The fact is they
didn't do it.
MR. DOMENICO: Justice Breyer, the -- the
Court has been clear that a State's failure -- normally,
that's true. The normal rule under the Rules of Civil
Procedure is a forfeiture of that sort, failure to raise
an argument, is deemed essentially to be a waiver under
those definitions.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this wasn't failure
to raise an argument; this was representing to the court
we will not challenge timeliness. That was the
representation made to the court. That was not
negligent oversight in not raising the question. It was
an affirmative representation to the court that,
although we might have done it, we will not challenge
timeliness.
MR. DOMENICO: Justice Ginsburg, there --
there was an element of mistake, of negligence, as you
say, but -- but it also was --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't the State adhere to
that?
MR. DOMENICO: That's right, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It kept its word, didn't
MR. DOMENICO: What the State was trying to
do, I think, is slightly different than would make sense
in any other context. Because of the special procedures
we're under in a habeas -- a pre-answer response, what
we were telling the court was we will not assert this
argument unless there's further inquiry from the court.
Now, normally in court there would be --
JUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait, wait. When you
say "further," I want to be very precise about the
distinction. You have to put it in your answer. You
didn't. Okay. So, that's a forfeiture. So, now the
judge says you didn't put it in your answer, but I'll
raise it. So, now you have the right to have the case
dismissed for statute of limitations. Do you want to
exercise that right? The answer to that question was
you didn't.
MR. DOMENICO: That is --
JUSTICE BREYER: You said you didn't care.
MR. DOMENICO: That's -- I don't think
that's quite an accurate characterization of what the
State --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, but, one,
do the characterization, but please don't forget my
first question, because so far I'm just stuck on Black's
Law Dictionary. And I would like you to have better
authorities for your -- you know, the supporting --
MR. DOMENICO: Well, the Black's Law
Dictionary, of course, applies a usual rule. This Court
has made clear in Granberry and Day that the usual rule
that a forfeiture of a legal right means that it's not
to be brought up again, that it doesn't apply to bind
the court's hands. Granberry and Day make that quite
clear. What happened in Granberry would have been a
forfeiture --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Domenico, you're
saying something considerably more. You're saying that
when a State gets up -- after inquiry by the district
court, when a State gets up and says we do not want to
press this argument; now we're not saying the
argument is wrong, because after all we're a repeat
player and we're going to hear that argument again, and
we are not saying that argument is wrong, but in this
case we do not want to press that argument. That's --
that's unequivocal to me.
MR. DOMENICO: It's unequivocal that we were
not going to press it again, though I think the
implication -- there would have been no reason to have
raised it initially. There would have been no reason to
include this caveat about refusing to concede, if that
was all we were trying to say. There are easy ways for
a State to take the issue off the table.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I -- can I ask you,
do you mean to tell me that, using your own words in
your brief, that a waiver is the intentional abandonment
of a known right? I think you're equating intentional
abandonment of a known right to be I have to admit I
could win and I'm giving up that argument.
MR. DOMENICO: Well, in this case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that what you're
saying -- deliberate?
MR. DOMENICO: Well, you have to know what
it is you're giving up.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you knew you had a
defense under the statute of limitations.
MR. DOMENICO: Sure.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You thought, because you
conceded, that you weren't conceding that it was
untimely. So, you were conceding you thought it was
untimely, and despite admitting that you knew you had a
defense, that you knew it could win, you were choosing
not to assert it. So, tell me why that's not either an
intentional waiver, a deliberate waiver, or an
abandonment of a known right?
MR. DOMENICO: The -- what we were
abandoning, to the extent we were abandoning anything,
it was our ability to force the court to address the
issue. In any other context, I agree that maybe --
there may be a distinction with no difference, but in
this case because there is discrete --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You were protecting the
court's right to do whatever it wanted.
MR. DOMENICO: There was a screening --
there is a screening function. We were raising the
issue precisely to put it on the court's table for
consideration. In a habeas --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why isn't it an
abuse of discretion for an appellate court, when there
has been an intentional abandonment of a known right, to
sua sponte raise that defense?
MR. DOMENICO: Well, we did not take off the
table the court's right to consider the issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You say you didn't abandon
the right. Isn't that your position? You did not
abandon it? You just --
MR. DOMENICO: We did not abandon --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You just gave up the -- the
opportunity to raise it yourself.
MR. DOMENICO: I think it's confusion
between what we are calling a right or the issue or the
defense. We, that's right, gave up our right in the
district court, unless asked, to argue the issue.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you this
example of -- of a regular civil case: There -- there
are two defendants and the same claim against two
defendants. One defendant files an answer and raises a
statute of limitations defense; the other one doesn't.
The judge asks the second defendant, are you going to
amend your complaint? And the defendant says no. Now,
is that a waiver or is that a forfeiture?
MR. DOMENICO: Well, I think in your typical
case, it doesn't matter because forfeitures generally
are deemed to be waivers, I think, in your typical case.
That's not true under Granberry and Day. The court has
made clear that a forfeiture is different than a
deliberate waiver.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, under the terminology
that we're using, wouldn't that be a forfeiture?
MR. DOMENICO: I think it's better
understood as a forfeiture. Simply you're not going to
argue the issue, but the issue doesn't necessarily need
to be taken off the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's why your
colleague on the other side -- why she made this point
the way she made it. I think there's no disagreement,
at least as far as I hear Justice Scalia. Look, he did
abandon his right, the State, to push the matter.
That's abandonment. He didn't abandon the right to get
the case dismissed if the judge pursues it.
So, your colleague says -- or as she says, a
court of appeals does have the power on its own to
overcome a forfeiture. That's Day. But they don't have
the power on its own to overcome the waiver. And that's
what they're doing. They don't have the power, in other
words, to decide it themselves. They only have the
power to overcome a forfeiture.
MR. DOMENICO: Well, if the Court looks at
the -- where this deliberate waiver exception to the
Granberry and Day rule comes from, it comes from Day,
and the concern there is with a court overriding a
State's decision to waive, to take the issue off the
table. There are examples of States doing that. And
when they do it, they are clear about it, and you can
tell when it would be overridden.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the consequence of
that was the district court then had to deal with the
case on the merits, had to take up the two exhausted
claims and rule on them, after having told the district
court you don't need -- we're not raising the statute of
limitations, we will not challenge timeliness. So, you
put the district court to the necessity of deciding the
case on the merits. It does. It takes up the two
unexhausted claims and deals with them on the merits.
In -- in Day, absolutely nothing transpired
between the State saying the claim was timely and the
magistrate's detection of the computation error. The
district court wasn't put to what was unnecessary work.
If the -- it was the consequence of saying we won't
challenge it that forced the district judge to deal with
them on the merits.
In Day, the counsel didn't bring up the
question because counsel thought that it was timely. He
had miscalculated and made a mathematical error. And
the judge then said, you know, I see that the number of
days that's required by statute, they have run. And as
Day pointed out, at that point, the trial judge could
have said: Now, you know, you miscalculated; wouldn't
you like to amend your complaint and put it in a
defense?
So, the two cases, the two situations are --
are so different. The district judge wasn't -- nobody
was made to do anything extra. But in -- here, because
the attorney said we won't challenge it, the judge had
to deal with the case on the merits.
MR. DOMENICO: That's right, Justice
Ginsburg. We failed in our -- in our duty and our
obligation to protect the district court from having to
engage in what, had we properly argued this, would have
been unnecessary effort.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Those are sunk costs,
aren't they, Mr. Domenico?
MR. DOMENICO: They are, Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's water over the dam,
and the issue is whether the court of appeals will then
have to repeat the district court's excursus into the
merits.
MR. DOMENICO: That's exact --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right?
MR. DOMENICO: That's exactly right. The --
we have already spent that time. The question now is
if -- if Mr. Wood prevails now, the court of appeals
will have to proceed to resolving the case on the
merits. Instead, in this case, they applied the very
common principle that a court of appeals will affirm for
any basis supported by the record in order precisely to
avoid -- that happens fairly often. They avoid having
to address a constitutional problem. They save having
to engage in those efforts again.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a matter of
discretion with the court of appeals?
MR. DOMENICO: Absolutely. We recognize
that this is in that middle ground where the court of
appeals was certainly under no obligation to do this.
Had the court of appeals refused to do it, we wouldn't
be here demanding that they be forced to consider this
issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And the court of appeals
could have gotten mad at the fact that the district
court was compelled to go through the merits, right?
MR. DOMENICO: Absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And for that reason could
have denied it. But it didn't get mad, I guess. I
don't know why.
MR. DOMENICO: Well, it didn't get mad
partly, I think, perhaps because Mr. Wood never argued
that the issue was forfeited or waived at all until
after -- after the court of appeals had already resolved
the question.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why do you say that
the position that the State took in the district court
prevented the district court from considering the
timeliness issue? If it wasn't a deliberate waiver,
then the district court under Day wasn't prohibited from
-- from deciding the case untimely.
MR. DOMENICO: Absolutely. I do not think
that the district court was prohibited from considering
it. The only reason for us to have raised this sort of
skeletal outline of the argument was precisely so the
court of appeals would have the opportunity to consider
Remember, this was raised initially in the
pre-answer response stage where the -- which is
specifically part of the district court's preliminary
consideration of the issue. So, it was certainly ex
ante quite possible that the response of the district
court would not be to simply ignore the issue as it did
but to either ask for additional briefing, as happens
with some regularity, to issue a show-cause order as it
had already done, or perhaps to dismiss the case again
as it had already done so.
So, the issue was not off the table. The
district court very much could have addressed the
question.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Domenico, do I
understand your argument correctly to think that if you
had not said, or if the lawyer for the State had not
said we're not conceding, if all that the lawyer for the
State had said is we're not challenging this, Your
Honor, would that count as a deliberate waiver under
Day?
MR. DOMENICO: I think that's a harder case.
The lead-up to that, I think, undermines the -- at
least, the unequivocal nature of -- of that statement
because there would have been no reason to have laid out
the potential argument if what we were really trying to
do was waive the -- waive the entire issue as Day uses
that language. If that's what we were trying to do,
there would have been no reason to do that either.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The new --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But this is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. The new case
law is what I said. When you say I won't raise this
defense, I waive it, everything you said except saying I
don't admit it, today, before a circuit court abuses its
discretion, you also have to say I am waiving the right
of the court of appeals to raise this sua sponte.
That's -- that's -- you want that to be what you need to
do for us to find a waiver.
MR. DOMENICO: I don't think you need to say
that. I don't think there necessarily need to be any
magic words at all, but it needs to be unequivocal and
clear, not ambiguous language that we're going to spend
an hour here today trying to debate what it was that we
meant. That's the only rule we're asking for today.
And the contrary rule really provides some
perverse incentives to States. I mean, here the State
was trying to be candid with the court. It discovered
this 1995 motion on its own. Mr. Wood had never
mentioned it in his filings. He had already briefed the
timeliness issue twice in the district court without
mentioning it, let alone raising it in any of his
petitions.
The State found this and tried to be candid,
that we weren't entirely clear about how the argument
played out. The alternative is that States will be
forced into something more than scorched earth, throw
everything at the court, see what sticks, and that's not
in anybody's interest, let alone the Federal courts' or
habeas petitioners'.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is something about
the principle of party presentation. The party raises
the issue. The court of appeals is the court of review,
not first view. Here -- in Day, the -- the lawyer did
not know that he had a statute of limitations defense,
that -- did not know because he had miscalculated the
time. Here the State knew very well that it did have a
statute of limitations argument, but it says we're not
challenging it.
And then the ordinary thing is that a court
of appeals reviews decisions of the district court;
doesn't decide questions in the first instance. But
here you are saying the attorney can tell district judge
don't decide this; go on to the merits. Then the court
of appeals, which is supposed to be reviewing what the
district court does, instead deals with that question in
the first instance. That seems like an odd inversion of
the role of the -- of the district court and court of
appeals.
MR. DOMENICO: Justice Ginsburg, again, I
don't think it's quite accurate to say that we told the
district court not to address the issue. We told the
district court there was an issue that we were going to
refrain from presenting our full argument on it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't say we're
going to refrain from it. You said, District Judge,
Your Honor, we will not challenge timeliness.
MR. DOMENICO: Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't have any
qualifications.
MR. DOMENICO: Well, I -- I do think we
qualified it. The only reason to include the language
about not conceding was to qualify that. The only
reason to lay out the argument was to make sure that the
court was able to consider it in its screening
procedures and --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But isn't the concession
language really going to a different point? The
concession language is going to the point of why it is
that you're not raising it, that you're not challenging
MR. DOMENICO: I don't think it is.
If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, finish.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please.
MR. DOMENICO: I don't think that there is
any reason for us to have been concerned about how -- if
we had simply stated we are not challenging it, there
would have been no concern about this affecting any
other case whatsoever. The only case in which to be
concerned that what we said would be misconstrued as a
waiver was this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
We will hear from Ms. Sherry first.
MS. LORD: Oh, I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Sherry.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
This Court's decisions in Granberry and Day
answer the first question presented. I think Petitioner
no longer contests that, and the Court can simply
decide the first question presented on that basis and
reaffirm what it said in Granberry.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Sherry, there is one
difference. If you put Granberry and Day together, it
gets you most of the way there. The one difference is
that here there was a sua sponte decision by the court;
whereas, in even the combination of Granberry and Day,
it was a party that raised it, although the party raised
it late.
So, why should that difference not matter?
If you think that party presentation has some
consequence in this area, you might think that that
difference does matter, that once you get to the court
of appeals and even then the party doesn't raise it,
sort of enough is enough.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: A couple of responses to
that. Number one, I think it's significant that Day
itself was a case in which the court raised it. It
raised it on its own.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But at the trial court
level.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: At the trial level.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Of course, the habeas court
has a significant screening function.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: No, that's certainly
true. I think the procedural default cases are another
good example. This Court in Day cited a number of them,
a number of them of which were cases in which the court
of appeals was raising the issue sua sponte.
On page 12 of our brief, we cite a number of
procedural default cases. A lot of them come up in the
sua sponte context. And the courts of appeals have not
made a distinction between the two.
I think they certainly implicate different
concerns. For example, to the extent this Court has
been worried about sandbagging or strategic behavior, I
think that's largely absent in circumstances where the
court is raising it on its own motions as opposed to the
party belatedly raising the issue on appeal.
So, I do think if you look at Granberry, you
look at Day, you look at Caspari, you look at Schiro,
and you look at the procedural default cases, I think
that really does resolve the first question presented.
And, again, I don't think Petitioner really argues
otherwise at this point.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I may have forgotten
the procedural complications of this case, but here, did
the State have any opportunity before the court of
appeals to raise the timeliness issue prior to the time
when the court of appeals issued its certificate of
appealability? And if the court of appeals had not
issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of
timeliness, would the issue have come up at all?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: The State did have an
opportunity in the court of appeals because, after the
application for a certificate of appealability was
filed, the court did order the State to file a response,
and the State didn't argue timeliness in that response.
But when the court of appeals did ask for briefing on
this issue in the certificate of appealability process,
the State, of course, did have an opportunity to respond
there, and it did argue that the petition was untimely,
and it strongly argued that.
And so, I guess, turning to the second
question presented, of deliberate waiver, I don't think
there has been a deliberate waiver in the way that Day
spoke about that term here for two primary reasons.
Number one, when Day spoke of deliberate waiver, it
spoke of overriding a State's deliberate waiver, and I
think if you look, when the court of appeals decided the
timeliness question, there's no way to look at that as
the State -- as a court, rather, actually overriding the
State's deliberate waiver. At that point, the State had
argued that the petition was untimely.
Petitioner never argued that the court
shouldn't decide the issue, never argued that that --
that the State had waived that issue below. And I think
at that time, it's really difficult to characterize that
as overriding the State's deliberate waiver.
The other point I would make is in the
district court --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the difference is
that in Day counsel didn't know that he had a statute of
limitations defense. So -- but the court suggested it.
In this case, the defendant -- I mean, the -- the
attorney knew, the State's attorney knew, they had a
statute of limitations defense and nonetheless told the
court we won't challenge timeliness.
It seems a big difference between the
factual background of Day, where the lawyer didn't know
there was a statute of limitations defense, and this
one, where the lawyer knew very well there was and
decided to tell the district court not to -- not to deal
with that issue.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: I -- I think that
certainly is true, but I think it's important, in
deciding whether or not this should be treated as a
deliberate waiver, to look at what the consequences of
treating it as such would be. The consequences of
treating it as a deliberate waiver under the language of
Day is that the court's hands would be bound; the court
would be unable to decide the timeliness question. And
it's not just the court of appeals; it's the district
court as well. So, if this were a clear deliberate
waiver in district court when the State filed its
pre-answer response, the district court would have been
without any authority to consider --
JUSTICE BREYER: So, why is that -- why is
that a bad result? The -- I -- imagine the facts are
these: The State forgets to waive the issue, to raise
the issue in the defense. All right? Forgets.
Judge: State you haven't raised a statute
of limitations.
State -- one possible answer -- thank you,
Your Honor. We overlooked our forfeiture. We want to
raise it.
That's one.
Number two: They say we don't care.
Number three: We don't want to. Okay?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, in two and three, you
can say this: You could say the reason that we depart
from the normal rule that you have to actually assert it
in your defense is we're trying to protect the State
because of habeas. So, we protect the State at least by
giving them a chance to make the argument when they
forget or some other reason. Now we gave them the
chance. Now they say: Huh? Who cares?
All right? If that's their attitude, why is
it the habeas court's business to protect the State from
themselves?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Because it's not just
about the State. Because it's -- because of the
institutional interests that are at stake. And that's
why Granberry and Schiro and Caspari and Day allowed
there to be consideration of these issues despite
forfeiture. It's because of the institutional
interest --
JUSTICE BREYER: Despite forfeiture?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Despite forfeiture.
Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: And --
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: And -- and that's the
very question here, whether it should be treated like
forfeiture or whether it would be treated like waiver.
And the reason why I think it would be a bad result to
treat it as waiver here and why it would be bad to have
bound the district court's hands in this case, if you
look at what happened here, the district court on its
own motion initially dismissed this as untimely. It
came back and it went to the State and said, you know, I
need more information. And the State provided that
additional information.
It would be a somewhat odd system for --
when the district court now had this information in
front of it, now knew about the 1995 motion, for it not
to have been able to do anything further with respect to
timeliness on -- on that point. The fact that the State
for whatever reason decided to press other issues
shouldn't bind the district court's hands except in the
rarest of circumstances.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Except we have a system
where the court doesn't raise issue on its own. The
ordinary rule is the party presents it, and when the
party says to the court we will not challenge
timeliness, it seems to me that's quite a different
thing from just having an answer that doesn't raise the
defense. It's affirmatively representing to the court
that we -- we are not making this an issue.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: And -- and to be clear, I
think that's certainly a factor that the courts can and
do consider in deciding whether to exercise their
discretion to consider a timeliness issue. The question
here is whether or not the court should lose any
discretion to consider that issue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Day did say that
if -- if a party knowingly waives a limitations defense,
then no court can bring it up. The party has made the
choice.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: That's -- that's what
this Court said in Day, and I guess the question is --
is how strictly that should be construed. And our
position would be that it should be strictly construed
because of the consequences of that waiver. And, again,
I think it's significant that the Court in Day did talk
about overriding a State's deliberate waiver.
In the dissent, Justice Scalia, you
mentioned the example of a court amending a party's
pleading over that party's objections. And I think that
really is a narrow circumstance in which the waiver rule
should operate.
It's not that the State's behavior is
irrelevant to the question before the court as to
whether the court should exercise its discretion; it's
actually quite relevant, and it's something that courts
of appeals can and do look at. The question is whether
or not the courts lack any authority to consider a
limitations defense or other procedural defense --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you're saying
that if the court of -- court says, you know, you have a
good state -- limitations defense, you would clearly win
on that, but I'm going to ignore it, even though you
didn't raise it?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: I'm sorry, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it be an abuse
of discretion for the court not to accept a valid,
evident statute of limitations defense on the ground
that the State didn't raise it?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY: I think under Day -- the
question is whether it's a deliberate waiver, and I
think, under Day, the Court said quite plainly that it
would be an abuse of discretion in those circumstances.
And I think there are a limited number of circumstances
where -- where that makes sense, and I think the Court
has seen examples of that recently this term, for
example.
The Court denied cert in a case, Buck v.
Thaler, earlier this term, where -- a predecessor case
that is an example of the State expressly waiving a
procedural default defense because it wanted the court
to reach the merits. In that case, the State said quite
plainly -- in the predecessor case, I should say, the
State said quite plainly because the use of race in the
punishment phase seriously undermined the fairness and
integrity of the judicial process, the director
expressly waives any procedural bar with respect to that
claim.
Now, that is the quintessential deliberate
waiver. And it took it off table, unlike what happened
in this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Lord, you have 3 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN A. LORD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. LORD: The problems with the rulings
urged by the amicus and by the State are severalfold.
One, it's not contemplated at all by AEDPA that the
-year Federal timing statute of limitations would be
subject to such a wide latitude in the court of appeals
to resurrect defenses.
JUSTICE ALITO: If a State knows that it has
a potential statute of limitations defense and says
nothing, is that a forfeiture or a waiver?
MS. LORD: It would be a violation of
Rule 5, which requires them to assert a time bar if they
are required to file a response. In our case, it also
would have been a violation of the court's order.
JUSTICE ALITO: So, simply saying nothing
can be a waiver, in your view.
MS. LORD: Probably not. But if you are --
JUSTICE ALITO: If the answer to that is
not, then what is the difference between saying nothing,
knowing that you have a defense, and saying we're not
challenging but we're not conceding?
What is the difference?
MS. LORD: Well, by not conceding, that
doesn't undercut the deliberateness of the waiver. It
actually establishes it. It establishes that they know
that there's a defense, and they're not agreeing that
the petition is timely, but they're deliberately
choosing not to assert the statute of limitations.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me just ask it one
more way, and then I'll --
MS. LORD: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE ALITO: Back in the office, they're
considering -- in the State's office, they're
considering what they're going to do. And they say,
well, what we're going to do is we're not going to
challenge it, but we're not going to concede it. And,
therefore, they say nothing.
MS. LORD: In the face of Rule 5's
requirement, it could very well be a waiver. And I'd
cite the court to Hill v. New York, which also addresses
one of the State's lawyers' points, which was a
waiver -- for the State to waive a statute of
limitations defense, its waiver has to be unequivocal
and clear. I don't know if they're suggesting that
there also has to be an advisement by the court. I
don't think they're going that far.
But the fact is, you look at the nature of
the waiver or the right being waived. And this Court
recognized in Hill v. New York and other cases that if
the right being waived is, for example, the right to be
tried in a timely fashion under IAD, it can be waived
just by a lawyer accepting a date.
And the statute of limitations issue here is
a typical strategic decision. And when AEDPA brought
this in, it didn't bring it in as it brought in comity.
It is something to move the case along from the Federal
point of view. And for this Court to adopt what --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your
sentence, please.
MS. LORD: -- the State is suggesting will
just take away all the efficiencies that -- that that 1
year brought to bear.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the
