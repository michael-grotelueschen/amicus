JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in
Florida against Nixon.
Mr. Lemieux.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. LEMIEUX
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEMIEUX: Justice Stevens, and may it please
the Court:
When experienced counsel thoroughly
investigates, prepares for trial, and discusses his trial
strategy with his client, a challenge for effectiveness
may not presume prejudice. Rather, this Court's two-part
inquiry, articulated in Strickland v. Washington, is the
proper measure.
The Florida Supreme Court erred in its decision
below for three main reasons.
First, they failed to apply Strickland's two-
part circumstance-specific, performance prejudice inquiry
to a question of trial strategy.
Second, it improperly presumed prejudice under
this Court's decision in United States v. Cronic where
there was neither a complete denial of counsel, nor did
counsel entirely fail to subject the State's case to
meaningful adversarial testing.
Third, the Florida Supreme Court improperly
expanded this Court's decision in Boykin v. Alabama from
governing pleas of guilt to governing tactical decisions
made during full-fledged trials.
For these three reasons and because the Florida
court's decision conflicts with Strickland and its progeny
and will disrupt the effective administration of justice,
we request reversal.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Counsel, was was the
attorney's essential concession of guilt sort of the
functional equivalent of a guilty plea, do you think?
MR. LEMIEUX: No, Justice O'Connor, it was not.
Mr. Corin, after speaking to his client on three occasions
about this trial strategy, sought to concede the
underlying -- the underlying crimes but to argue what was
the most essential part of this case, and that was whether
or not death should be the outcome of the jury.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, yes, he clearly tried
to preserve a role in the sentencing, but we often have
guilty pleas and then leave the sentencing to be
determined. Was was what he did concerning the
guilt/innocence phase the equivalent of a guilty plea, do
you think?
MR. LEMIEUX: It was not, Your Honor, because a
guilty plea, as this Court talked about in Boykin v.
Alabama, gives up rights of the defendant. The lawyer and
the defendant waive rights. They waive the right to
trial. They waive the right to have the State prove their
case beyond a reasonable doubt. They waive the right to
have a jury, to confront witnesses, to cross examine, all
of the attendant trial rights. Mr. Nixon --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was there any cross
examination of witnesses conducted?
MR. LEMIEUX: There was some cross examination,
not a lot. There was cross examination of one of Mr.
Nixon's uncles, who was one of the seven confessions in
this case, and we don't know specifically why Mr. Corin
engaged in that cross examination. It could be because
that was probably the weakest of the seven confessions and
perhaps he wanted the jury to hear that that confession
was weak.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There was also an objection to
introduction of of photographs that -- that were
inflammatory, wasn't there?
MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, there was, Justice Scalia.
In fact, you know, Mr. Nixon was -- was very much engaged
in the guilt phase of this trial. He objected to the
introduction of evidence.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Those photographs would have
infected the -- the penalty phase, as well as the guilt
--  --
phase. So it was important for him to object to them.
MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: In the guilt phase.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You said Mr. Nixon was -- was
the client. Was he in the courtroom?
MR. LEMIEUX: Mr. Nixon was in the courtroom for
portions of the trial. He was in --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was -- was he there -- and
I'll check the record -- when the attorney told the jury
that that his client was was guilty, that he
basically was conceding guilt?
MR. LEMIEUX: Mr. Nixon was not in the courtroom
for the opening statement or the closing statement.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But not for the opening
statement.
MR. LEMIEUX: He was there during some of voir
dire. He was there after the opening statement when two
witnesses testified, one who testified that he was the
person who tried to sell the victim's car and positively
identified him in the courtroom, and another when the
sheriff's deputy positively identified him as the person
who confessed and gave the 45-minute confession and the
person he arrested. After those two witnesses testified,
Mr. Nixon then decided to leave the courtroom on that
occasion.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The other side says that guilt
is not as -- not as clear as you -- as you make it out.
Is -- is that -- is that issue even before us here?
MR. LEMIEUX: Your -- Your Honor, none of that
evidence has been presented in any of the post-conviction
proceedings, and while it's creative, I think it's not
before this Court because it's never been entered into
evidence. It's just speculation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it isn't a matter of
whether it's before it. I -- I just wonder whether it
goes to -- to the issue here, whether you needed to get
his assent or not. It -- it probably goes to the quite
separate question of whether there was inadequate
performance by counsel. No? Is that question before us
also?
MR. LEMIEUX: It is, Your Honor. Both questions
are before you. I -- I believe that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Was -- was the latter question
ruled upon below?
MR. LEMIEUX: What the Florida Supreme Court did
is they found that since this was the functional
equivalent of a guilty plea, if there was not explicit and
affirmative consent, that Cronic would apply and a
presumption of prejudice would follow.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but -- no. I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And never -- and never reached
the -- the inadequate performance of counsel question.
MR. LEMIEUX: The -- the only thing that they do
say, Your Honor, is that they say that the strategy
employed by Mr. Corin may well have been in Mr. Nixon's
best interests.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but they didn't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They may, but that wasn't a
definitive ruling. So do you agree that if we accept the
position that you are taking, a remand would require for
that for that evidence to be considered on the
straightforward question did counsel perform adequately?
MR. LEMIEUX: Your Honor, there were three
hearings in the post-conviction proceedings, and the
the defense, who had the burden in those cases to prove
ineffective assistance of counsel only put on Mr. Corin
and the State cross examined Mr. Corin and called some
other witnesses. I don't know what further evidence could
be adduced that would go to a separate claim.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- it might be that
there would be no justification for further evidence, but
there would have to be a Strickland ruling on the merits
of the Strickland issue, wouldn't there be?
MR. LEMIEUX: I think that this Court could
engage in that. I think you could remand and have the
Florida Supreme Court engage in that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But nobody has explicitly done
that yet. Is that correct?
MR. LEMIEUX: They have not because the Florida
Supreme Court ruled under Cronic.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Because of the Cronic point.
MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about the courts
below the Florida Supreme Court? Didn't they rule on it?
MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, Your Honor. Three trial
court judges all found that there was effective assistance
of counsel.
Judge Hall, who presided over the trial, in
fact, described Mr. Corin's advocacy as being right on the
mark. He found in his approach an excellent analysis of
the realities of the case and the preservation of
credibility and the credibility of any mitigating
circumstances. He also found that it was perhaps the only
steps that could have been taken to afford his client some
relief.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Getting back to the practical
equivalent of a guilty plea, Brookhart v. Janis do you
think goes to the outer margin of what the functional
equivalent is? Are there other examples of what a
functional equivalent would be that would fall under both
Cronic and Brookhart? We have a line-drawing problem --
MR. LEMIEUX: Sure, sure.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as -- as to whether or not
this is the functional equivalent.
MR. LEMIEUX: Your Honor, I think that Brookhart
in fact probably supports our position because in
Brookhart the situation was factually different. It was
more of a -- a guilty plea situation where there was going
to be this prima facie trial, which was, in essence, a
guilty plea with a profferer through one witness. And in
that case, the defendant stood up and said, I want a
trial, I want everyone to understand I'm not pleading
guilty. And this Court said that counsel can't waive
those rights to a full trial when the defendant is
objecting to it, but if the defendant consents or
acquiesces, this Court said the ruling would be different.
Well, certainly Mr. Nixon at least acquiesced.
Mr. Corin spoke to him on three occasions -- and that can
be found at 255 of the joint appendix -- and talked to him
about this strategy. Mr. Nixon never responded either way
as to his assent or what he wanted to be done.
Now, Judge Ferris, who was the third trial court
judge who heard this matter, said that because of the
longstanding relationship between this defendant and this
lawyer, because he had represented him three times before
over a 2-year period, that there was a level of
relationship, they were both veterans of the criminal
justice system, they had a rapport with each other. And
she was able to determine that there was consent to the
trial strategy in the fact that Mr. Nixon did not object
to it.
The Florida Supreme Court wants explicit and
affirmative consent, and they want a colloquy on the
record. And we think that this will be very problematic,
and we're already seeing these problems in Florida.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any cases involving
what -- what you describe as tacit consent?
MR. LEMIEUX: In terms of a trial strategy, Your
Honor?
JUSTICE SCALIA: In -- in terms of of
pleading guilty. Do we have any cases in which a similar
thing happened, that the counsel said I'm going to plead
you guilty and the -- the defendant doesn't say anything,
just passively sits there as though, you know?
MR. LEMIEUX: Your Honor, I think you do and I
think that Boykin addresses that there has to be a
colloquy with a plea of guilty, and that the -- the
defendant can't tacitly consent to a plea of guilty.
But our position is that this is not a plea of
guilty. This is not a complete surrender. This is a
tactical retreat made for reasons of trying to contest the
one issue in this case that could be contested, and that
was trying to save this defendant's life. This lawyer
took 52 depositions. He hired medical professionals. He
investigated Mr. Nixon's background, going back to the age
of 10. He did everything --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened to the
photographs? I wasn't clear from the submissions. There
were inflammatory photographs. Were they in fact
admitted?
MR. LEMIEUX: They were admitted over his
objection, and that was taken up on direct appeal to the
Florida Supreme Court, and the Florida Supreme Court, in
Nixon I, did not find that they were inflammatory and
found that their introduction was proper.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they were not
reintroduced at the sentencing phase.
MR. LEMIEUX: They were already in evidence and
the State incorporated its evidence from the guilt phase
into the sentencing phase. It's just a procedure. The
only evidence that the State put on in the guilt phase
were his prior two convictions and evidence that Mr. Nixon
tortured the defendant by removing her underwear before he
burned her alive. Besides that, the rest of the evidence
was incorporated from the guilt phase.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask if -- do you think
his representation would have been inadequate if he had
not discussed the strategy with the client but everything
else was exactly the same?
MR. LEMIEUX: It may -- it may have been but it
would be something that would be evaluated under
Strickland, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why would it be -- why
would it make any difference under Strickland whether he
talked to the client or not if the same -- if the same
considerations are in play? In other words, he just knew
it was the -- the wiser strategy to try and save him from
the death penalty?
MR. LEMIEUX: I think the only point I would
make there is this Court said in Strickland that counsel
should consult with their -- with their client, with the
accused, and that that's an obligation on counsel. If
there was a failure to consult, perhaps that would be
argued that that failure to consult was deficient
performance.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that isn't that
because we -- we take the consultation at -- at least as
an indication that the lawyer was -- was adequate in
communicating back and forth with the client so that the
client could tell him what the lawyer needed to know to
defend him?
MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, Justice Souter, I think
that's correct. I think that there could be meaningful
discussions between the defendant and the accused that can
help the lawyer represent the defendant at trial.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But even apart from the
competence of the lawyer, whether it shows adequate
performance by the lawyer, can't you -- can't you divide
the Boykin rule, which doesn't relate to the lawyer's
competence at all, into three different categories:
number one, where there is express consent which is
makes it okay; number two, when there's no consent at all,
which is bad; and number three, where there is what --
what you call here implicit consent? Aren't there really
three different situations?
MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.
That's what the Court speaks about in Brookhart, and
although we think that that's more of a guilty plea case
than a trial strategy case, if this Court were to go in
that direction, that standard certainly could apply.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me rather
difficult to -- to draw that line. If -- if consent is
necessary, why shouldn't it be express? I'm not saying
consent is necessary, but normally if you're going to have
something this important and consent is necessary, it
seems to me it ought to be clear on the record. You
certainly wouldn't accept this for a guilty plea, what you
have here.
MR. LEMIEUX: That's correct, Your Honor, but in
-- I think this Court has held in cases like Jones v.
Barnes and Taylor v. Illinois, that questions of strategy
are questions that are reserved to the lawyer, and that
all --
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's right, and that's why
I'm suggesting if it really is a question of strategy, you
don't even need implicit consent.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And I'm not sure there's a --
MR. LEMIEUX: We --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- three-part rule, as Justice
Scalia says. There's just a two-part rule.
MR. LEMIEUX: We -- we agree with that position,
Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I assume -- I assume
your response is that if you eliminate from the Boykin
rule the possibility of implicit consent, you are forcing
the lawyer who believes he has the consent of -- of a --
an intractable client such as this fellow who -- who
didn't go into the courtroom, took all his clothes off so
they couldn't take him into the courtroom. He was
obviously not -- didn't want to be responsive. Your --
you would have forced this lawyer to adopt a strategy
which the lower court found would have been damaging to
this defendant, even though the lawyer believes that the
defendant really approved of the strategy that the lawyer
was undertaking. Why would we want to adopt a rule like
that?
MR. LEMIEUX: Your Honor, it's not our position
that you should a rule of consent. I was saying if this
Court were going in that direction, that the acquiescence
level would be what we would suggest.
JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what about a --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If there were a plea -- if it
were a plea of guilt, wouldn't this be an academic
question because I assume Florida has some counterpart to
the rule 11 colloquy where the judge must confront the
defendant and ask him a series of questions to elicit his
consent? So this issue can come up, if you have a
counterpart to rule 11, only in the concession of guilt by
the attorney but with a trial.
MR. LEMIEUX: Your Honor, Florida does have a
rule for a guilty plea, but -- and now the Florida Supreme
Court says there has to be a colloquy for a strategy
--  1  decision that where there's a concession, but we
disagree with that. We don't think that there should be a
colloquy. We don't think that that -- that should be
required. And we think that that's problematic and we're
already seeing in Florida that -- that judges, laboring
under the Nixon decision, are asking questions to
defendants as to whether or not all sorts of strategy
decisions are decisions they agreed to.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If Florida wanted to adopt
that procedure on its own, that wouldn't present a Federal
question. I mean, the prosecutor would have no -- the
prosecutor would have no right to stop it if the -- if
Florida said, well, we want that same colloquy to go on
whether it's a guilty plea or whether it's a concession of
guilt.
MR. LEMIEUX: Well -- well, Justice Ginsburg,
they're doing it under these decisions of this Court is
the reason why that they've articulated that this has to
be done. They're saying it's a functional equivalent of a
guilty plea. Therefore, Boykin is required and therefore
there has to be a colloquy. And we think that those
colloquies are tremendously problematic, that they invade
the attorney-client privilege. They may affect an
accused's right to -- you know, not to self-incriminate
himself. There may violate the relationship between the
lawyer and his client.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but these -- let me just
understand. These colloquies are not, in your view,
commanded by the Florida Supreme Court's holding.
MR. LEMIEUX: They are. The Florida Supreme
Court specifically says you must have these colloquies to
determine consent.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But only -- is it -- it's not
just when there's the equivalent of the guilty plea, but
any major trial strategy --
MR. LEMIEUX: The lower -- Justice, I'm sorry.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is this -- I want to know if
the Florida Supreme Court's holding is limited to cases
that are the functional equivalent of -- of a guilty plea,
and -- and it's only there that they're requiring the
colloquy.
MR. LEMIEUX: It's only there that they've
required it, but lower courts now defense counsel are
making these arguments that, boy, you know, and the judge
is concerned this is a strategy decision.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but of course what the
lower courts are doing may or may not be right as a matter
of Florida law, but that's not before us really.
MR. LEMIEUX: It's not before Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, if it were a matter
of Florida law, the Florida legislature could change it.
MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: If it's a matter of Federal
law, it can't.
MR. LEMIEUX: That's correct.
If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my
time.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gornstein.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Stevens, and may it
please the Court:
The most serious problem with the Florida
Supreme Court's explicit consent requirement is that it
prevents counsel from pursuing what may be the most
effective strategy for saving a defendant's life, even
when counsel consults with the defendant on that strategy
and the defendant does not object. In that situation, the
Florida Supreme Court would require counsel to pursue an
alternative reasonable doubt strategy even though that
might undermine the case for sparing the defendant's life
and even though the defendant has not consented to that
strategy either.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we take it as a given that
if he does not consent, in fact, directs his lawyer not to
make this concession, that the lawyer is bound to follow?
MR. GORNSTEIN: No, Justice Kennedy. You would
still look at that question through the prism of
Strickland's reasonableness inquiry. It would raise
distinct concerns. A reasonable counsel would make a
reasonable effort to iron out differences. Reasonable
counsel takes into account the considered views of his
client. But if, at the end of that process, counsel
reasonably concludes that this is the only effective
strategy for saving the defendant's life, then the pursuit
of that strategy is not per se ineffective.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does -- does that up the ante
and the defendant now is in the position to terminate the
lawyer, or will the judge say it's -- it's too late, I'm
not going to grant that motion?
MR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: As -- as a matter of Federal
law.
MR. GORNSTEIN: As -- the defendant could go to
the -- to the judge and his counsel could go to the judge
and say, we have had such a breakdown between us on what
should be done here, we think alternative counsel should
be appointed. But that would be a discretionary call for
the district court. So too, the defendant could say, I
want to exercise my right to self-representation, which he
has a right to do. So those are the two checks on that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But what -- what if there's a
third possibility and -- and the lawyer makes remarks in
front of the jury, as -- as this lawyer did, in effect,
concession kind of remarks, and the defendant stands up
and says, hey, I'm not making those concessions? I am not
guilty. I'm not conceding a darned thing. Does the
lawyer at that point at least have a -- an option to
proceed on the concession theory, leaving it to judge his
performance under Strickland afterwards?
MR. GORNSTEIN: If I understand your question,
Justice Souter, this is a situation where there was no
objection initially, the lawyer proceeded to adopt a
strategy, and then there was a --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- actually I -- I
didn't get into that one way or the other. Let's assume
we've got a case in which the client says, no, I -- I
don't agree to these concessions. I'm not guilty and I
want a defense. As I understood your -- your earlier
answer, you said if -- you know, if it is the lawyer's
considered judgment that this is the only way to save his
life -- he's talked with him, et cetera -- he -- he still
may have that option to concede. And I'm taking the --
the facts one step further and saying let's assume the --
the client goes whole-hog in his objection. And he stands
up or -- or says in front of the judge and the jury, I
I'm not conceding any of this.
MR. GORNSTEIN: That -- that sounds to me like a
case where there ought to be alternative counsel appointed
if there has been such a --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I would certainly agree if
we get to that point. But let's the lawyer does, as you
at least left the door open for him to do, and -- and he
does proceed to represent the guy. The judge doesn't
remove him and the lawyer continues to concede. Do you --
do you think that there is any possibility on a Strickland
analysis of finding adequacy of counsel?
MR. GORNSTEIN: Probably not, Justice Souter,
that you would analyze that under Strickland and you would
find that that's not the reasonable performance of counsel
in that circumstance.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I --
MR. GORNSTEIN: And so -- but the question here
really is what do you do not in a case where there's been
an objection, because there was no objection here.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So a substantial component of
reasonableness under Strickland is whether or not you
follow the client's instructions?
MR. GORNSTEIN: It is one factor that reasonable
counsel will take into account, but it is not the only
factor. In some situations, if you're not following the
defendant's instructions, it can lead to such a breakdown
in the attorney-client relationship that you couldn't
possibly render effective assistance of counsel. So it is
going to be a factor in that respect.
But this case presents only the question of what
happens when there's no objection, and when there's no
objection, it makes no sense to say that where there's
been consultation, no objection, that instead of allowing
the lawyer to exercise his reasonable judgment on what the
best thing to do is, he instead has to pursue an
alternative reasonable doubt strategy that is less
effective. And the Sixth Amendment simply can't be read
to require counsel to pursue a less effective strategy
that the defendant hasn't asked for.
Now, there's no perfect analogy here, but the
closest analogy is to the division of responsibilities for
appeal where the defendant has the right to say whether he
will appeal, but counsel has the right primarily to make
the strategic judgments of what arguments will be raised
on appeal. So too here, the -- the defendant has the
right to decide to stand trial, but client has primary
responsibility for making the strategic judgment of what
defenses will be raised at that trial.
Now, there is -- this is an important question,
and therefore there is a duty on the part of counsel to
consult with the defendant, but once that consultation has
occurred, and there is no objection, and the choice that
counsel made is a reasonable, tactical judgment under all
the facts and circumstances, his pursuit of that strategy
satisfies constitutional standards. There is no
requirement of explicit, affirmative consent, and the
Florida Supreme Court's judgment should, therefore, be
reversed.
If the Court has no further questions, thank
you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.
Mr. Tillinghast.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD H. TILLINGHAST, III
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. TILLINGHAST: Mr. Justice Stevens, and may
it please the Court:
The issue before the Court today is whether a
defense counsel can concede guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt in his opening and in his closing statements in the
trial, particularly when the defendant is not present. We
submit that the answer is no, and there's two reasons that
it's no.
First, we believe that it's the functional
equivalent of a guilty plea as found by the Florida
Supreme Court.
Second, because the -- what was stated was so
clearly an acknowledgement that the State had proven its
case, that there was a complete breakdown of the
adversarial process and there was no meaningful testing of
the State's case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Tillinghast, may I go
back to something you said? Because I don't want to lose
sight of it. You seem to suggest that the defendant's
absence from the trial should work in his favor when this
was defendant's own choice not to be there. The judge met
with him and said I want to make sure you know what you're
doing. Right? Why should we count at all in the
defendant's favor that he was -- he absented himself from
trial any more than we would give a fugitive credit for
not being there?
MR. TILLINGHAST: Justice Ginsburg, part of the
issue here is -- is the lack of consent. Mr. Nixon was
not present during the entire guilt phase of the trial.
What we would submit is that in this case where there was
the hearing in a holding cell -- it was on the record.
It's part of the record before Your Honor -- where the
judge inquired about Mr. Nixon's willingness to
participate in his trial, and he declined to go into the
courtroom, that refusal to go into the courtroom, we
submit, was a refusal to attend the -- the hearing on the
presumption that he was going to have a trial consistent
with his guilty plea -- or not guilty plea -- excuse me --
the not guilty plea that was entered. What he anticipated
was a trial where the State's case was -- was tested and
it was consistent with his not guilty plea.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But he --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you -- you equate this
to a case where the defendant is just accidentally not
present. That's -- that's what I got. I -- I had the
same problem with your opening two sentences as Justice
Ginsburg did. You said if the defendant is absent from
the courtroom. Well, in this case, he was absent because
he chose to be absent. You're -- you're equating this
case to one in which it was as if for some reason they
forgot to have him in the courtroom.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, the -- the important
issue here is there was not consent. The lack of his
presence in the courtroom compounded that problem, but the
important issue here and the issue before the Court is
that defense counsel conceded guilt and conceded that the
State had proven its case without the consent of his own
client.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't agree with your earlier
statement that what -- what this defendant expected was a
contested trial in which, you know, the State's evidence
is challenged, blah, blah, blah. That's to the contrary.
He said this whole thing is -- is just a big railroad job
and that's one reason I don't want to be there. Go ahead
and do whatever you want. He wasn't he wasn't
expecting -- in fact, if you're -- if you're talking about
is subjective expectations, they would reinforce the
lawyer's belief that he had no objection to conceding
guilt because he was referring to this as -- as one big
railroad job.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, respectfully, Your
Honor, I would -- I would disagree because that what --
what we do have from Mr. Nixon is he stated that -- that
he had fired his lawyer. He wanted a black lawyer. He
wanted a black judge, and that he didn't want to go into
the courtroom because he would be railroaded. That was
after in the newspaper it had indicated that he had --
that his counsel had pled him guilty in his opening
statement, and he was clearly objecting to that conduct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought he had made those
statements about being railroaded before he found out
about the lawyer's concession.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Actually the you're
correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's correct.
MR. TILLINGHAST: The the railroading
statements were before the opening statements. The
objection to the newspaper story was after the opening
statement.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you a question just
about what you -- what you're assuming when you make the
-- the statement -- prefaced the argument to the effect
that there was a complete breakdown of -- of the adversary
process. You're assuming, I take it, when you say that,
that the guilt phase and the penalty phase have got to be
regarded as distinct and separate phases.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: You're dividing it in half.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why is that -- why is that
legitimate? Why should a lawyer -- I mean, I presume no
defense lawyer tailors his his guilt phase
representation without a thought to what is going to
happen at the penalty phase if they get to the penalty
phase. And so I -- I have difficulty in saying that there
should be some kind of a firewall for analytical purposes
between guilt and penalty when -- when we're in a -- a
question of Cronic or Strickland.
MR. TILLINGHAST: If the Court -- if the Court
was to look at the totality and -- as opposed to looking
at the guilt phase, what would happen would be that
capital cases would have -- would end up having a lower
standard than a non-capital case because --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they wouldn't end up
having lower standards. They -- they would end up having
a a standard at the guilt phase which takes into
consideration what the lawyer is or is not going to be
able to do plausibly at -- at the sentencing phase. And
you know, those -- those may be very, very difficult
questions, but it's hard for me to say that either the
standard is different or that a lawyer should -- or that
we, in setting down standards, should pretend that a
lawyer somehow has to go into a state of oblivion about --
about what's going to happen at sentencing if he gets
there.
MR. TILLINGHAST: The difficulty here is -- is
this was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea
without consent, and --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let me ask you this.
Do you think that it's possible that in some instances it
is a valid strategy to focus on the punishment/sentencing
phase rather than the guilt phase if the lawyer has
reviewed all the evidence and it appears to the lawyer to
be overwhelming? Is it possible that there's a case where
a strategy such as this might make sense?
MR. TILLINGHAST: Your Honor --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that possible?
MR. TILLINGHAST: With -- with statements in the
opening --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that possible?
MR. TILLINGHAST: Not without the consent of a
client with statements like this.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, now you're building in
something that I didn't ask. I'm asking you if it is
possible that the better strategy for a defendant in a
given case would be to focus on the sentencing rather than
the guilt phase based on an evaluation by the attorney of
the evidence.
MR. TILLINGHAST: There could be circumstances.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know why you're so --
I thought that the literature was replete with Law Review
articles saying that this is the best strategy. Trial
judges have told us this is the best strategy. I -- I
don't quite understand your hesitation unless it's to
build in this -- this factor of consent.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, it is the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I thought this -- this
was something you'd say, well, of course.
MR. TILLINGHAST: It -- it is the factor of the
consent. In -- in this case, in the opening statement,
the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but what -- what about
the basic question, that as a matter of trial strategy, it
is a recognized, acceptable, sometimes prudent, sometimes
wise strategy to concentrate on a sentencing phase?
MR. TILLINGHAST: In the general sense, yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And there's no difference
between a capital case and a regular case insofar as the
intelligence of that strategy is concerned because even
when there is not a separate penalty phase, it is
sometimes in the interest of the defendant to, in effect,
throw himself on the mercy of the sentencer, whether that
is the jury or the judge, by -- by not contesting the
the fact that -- that he did the acts charged. That --
that occurs not just in capital case but in -- in regular
cases.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, Justice, the the
distinction here is -- is it -- it wasn't a strategy to
not contest the State's case. What it -- what it was was
it was a complete concession in opening statement that the
State would prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not entirely because both in
the opening and in closing, the lawyer said to the jury,
he did it, but I want you to know from my very opening
that this case is about life or death, and that's the
ultimate decision you will have to make. He said that in
his opening and he said it in his closing. It wasn't
simply a case of saying, my client did and now the
prosecutor is going to go through the motions. He told
the jury, what I want you to focus on is the decision
you're going to have to make whether, in the counsel's
words, to spare his life.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the
issue here is that he did that and he went beyond just
saying that he did it. He said that the State has proven
its case beyond a reasonable doubt for murder and arson,
and he did it without consent. That's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you say without
consent. At least as -- the record that we have suggests
that the client was told this is what the lawyer planned
to do and said nothing.
Justice Scalia asked a question when the prior
argument was ongoing. When a client doesn't say yes and
he doesn't say no, to take the words of a familiar song,
mustn't the lawyer then do what he thinks is best to do?
Because if he says, okay, I'm going to -- I'm going to
require a full-stop trial, I'm going to cross examine
every witness, he may be damaging his client. The client
didn't tell him not to do that any more than he told him
to do it. So mustn't the lawyer in that situation
exercise his best judgment?
MR. TILLINGHAST: I would submit that in this
case, because that it is the functional equivalent of a
guilty plea, and as this Court has held under Boykin and
under Brookhart that you must have voluntary and willing
and knowing consent --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what if we think that's
not correct, that it is not the equivalent of a guilty
plea? There was some cross examination. There was some
participation. So if we don't accept your statement that
it is the functional equivalent, then what standard do we
employ for the tacit consent or the failure to
affirmatively respond?
MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, Justice O'Connor, if --
if you're -- if the Court was to view it as not the
functional equivalent, as you've suggested, you could
affirm based upon the nature of the statements and finding
that there was a complete failure under Cronic.
And -- and with respect to the trial, there were
-- there were 35 witnesses called by the State. There
were five what I would submit were perfunctory questions
asked on cross.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you said we could
affirm if we applied Cronic, but I thought the issue was
whether perhaps Strickland applied, and if Strickland
applies, I wouldn't think we'd be affirming necessarily.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, Strickland is -- is
respectfully not before the Court. It was -- the record
below was strictly on --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the -- the question of
which standard applies I thought was before the Court.
Was it correct for the Florida Supreme Court to employ the
Cronic standard or should it have reviewed it under
Strickland? Is that not before us? Is that not --
MR. TILLINGHAST: Yes.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- one of the questions?
MR. TILLINGHAST: Yes.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay. Thank you.
JUSTICE BREYER: I thought that Boykin and
Boykin and -- and Brookhart were about really a somewhat
different matter. The language, functional equivalent of
a guilty plea, is lifted from Brookhart. Boykin and
Brookhart are about what a judge does, not about what a
lawyer does. In Boykin, the judge accepted the guilty
plea, and the Court said you can't do it without the
express consent of the defendant. In Brookhart, it was a
judge who accepted -- now, here it was an odd procedure,
and it was that procedure that the Court called the
functional equivalent of a guilty plea. And therefore,
we're talking about what a judge can do. Here we're not.
We're talking about what a lawyer can do and when it
arises to the level of improper lack of counsel. So I
don't think they govern it.
Rather, I thought -- and I want your view on
this -- that the most relevant case was really Roe v.
Flores, you know, where -- where the lawyer did a weird
thing. He didn't file an appeal. And here he's doing a
little odd thing. So what we said there is you have to
consult, which is just what the Government is saying here.
I'm exposing that thought process to you to get your
reaction.
MR. TILLINGHAST: I -- I think, first, under --
under Jones v. Barnes, it's been held by this Court that
there are three fundamental things that only the client
can do, one of which is to plead guilty. And in -- in the
Roe case, the -- the record below was -- was unclear as to
what happened as to whether there was a duty for the
attorney to file an appeal and what the conversations were
or were not with -- with the defendant.
But we would submit that -- that a guilty plea
is something very special because that it goes to the
heart of the case.
JUSTICE BREYER: This is not a guilty plea and
the words -- a guilty plea is something accepted by a
judge and the judge didn't. But I grant you it's a very
odd situation and very special, and that's why I wonder
what the appropriate way to -- what kind of requirement
there ought to be. Maybe there should be something. I'm
not sure why it should rise above the level of
consultation since you know, better than I, you can have
some awfully difficult clients who are virtually incapable
of understanding what's in their interests. And -- and
that's why I'm awfully reluctant to go beyond saying you
have to consult with your client. You start insisting on
an answer, and you don't know what they're going to say.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, the -- the lawyer here
did have alternatives. He -- he could have put the State
to its burden and consistent with the not guilty plea that
was entered in the case. Or as an alternative, there
could have been an inquiry on the record of -- by the
judge with the lawyers of Mr. Nixon to determine whether
or not he was consenting to this -- this sort of -- the
opening statements and the closing statements, which
which were extraordinary, particularly the closing
statement because -- and in the closing statement, he
specifically said that the State did prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that each and every element of the crimes
charged, first degree, premeditated murder, kidnapping,
robbery, and arson, had been proven, which is truly
extraordinary. Here is a situation where the lawyer who
is the only person in the courtroom, because Mr. Nixon was
tried in absentia, who -- the only person in the courtroom
who was there as the trusted advisor and counselor for Mr.
Nixon, stands up in front of the jury in the opening and
the closing and concedes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
I would submit that upon doing that, the -- the whole
adversarial process breaks down because it --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? When -- when his object
is to spare this person's life. He knows the evidence is
very strong. He wants, to the extent that he can,
insulate the penalty phase from all that damning evidence
that's coming out at the trial. So he wants the evidence
to come out at the trial, but he doesn't want to be in a
situation where the jury has heard the defendant resist
the determination that he did it and then have to plead
for his life after.
MR. TILLINGHAST: The difficulty, again -- it
comes back to the lack of consent. Had he had consent, it
would be different.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, my problem -- and I --
I'm not sure I understand your answer to it. In this
case, in fact the client didn't say yes and he didn't say
no. So if the -- if the lawyer is to assume, well, then
since I don't have a positive, explicit yes, I will assume
the answer is no, even though that is against the lawyer's
best interest -- the -- the lawyer's best judgment, why is
he an effective counsel if he assumes the answer is no?
MR. TILLINGHAST: In -- in -- particularly in a
capital case, what this Court and all courts would
would want is a reliable record where there had been
testing. When you have a situation where Mr. Nixon, as
here, said nothing, so the -- so Mr. Corin didn't know
whether there was consent or lack of consent, we would
submit that what should have happened is, as I said --
suggested before, he shouldn't have -- he could have not
contested certain things, but the admission on the -- what
I submit is an admission and a plea of guilty without
consent was where the problem was. He could have gone
on --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- but that's not a
problem. According to the lower courts, that was a good
strategy. I don't know why you want counsel, when -- when
the client doesn't answer, to say, gee, I -- you know, I
don't know whether he has approved or disapproved, I'm
going to have to take the course that will probably get
him executed because I -- I haven't received an answer.
Why would you force that course on the -- on the lawyer?
If the lawyer believes that the silence implies consent,
as -- as silence usually does, why not let the lawyer do
what's in the client's best interest?
MR. TILLINGHAST: He had the alternative of --
of having an inquiry with Mr. Nixon, with the court
determine whether or not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And Nixon -- okay. You have
the inquiry and Nixon just stands there, the same, doesn't
say a thing, assuming you could get him into the
courtroom, you know, assuming he had put his clothes on so
you could bring him into the courtroom. He just -- he
just sits there.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you say, well, since
we don't have an answer, we have to take the course that's
going to get this guy executed. That doesn't seem to me
to make much sense.
MR. TILLINGHAST: I would respectfully submit
that given the nature of the opening and closing, the
words that were used, in -- in that kind of a extreme
situation, that is a decision that the client should make.
This is not a decision that is a normal strategy decision
that a lawyer would normally make, such as which witnesses
to -- to call, aside from the defendant himself, the order
of the witnesses, and -- and types of cross examination.
This is a very --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. No, but I don't think
--  --
you're getting to -- at -- at what bothers us. Nobody is
saying that the client should not make a decision. The
problem is that the client won't make a decision, and the
client acts as if he had made the decision to allow the
lawyer to do what the lawyer proposes. This isn't a
question of whether he should be heard or not, but what --
what to make of the behavior. And you're saying when --
when the behavior appears to be acquiescence from silence,
you nonetheless -- the lawyer is, nonetheless, obligated
to take the course which is coming closest to guaranteeing
that he will receive the death penalty. And that's what's
bothering us.
MR. TILLINGHAST: The in in this
situation, it's -- it's the nature of what was said and
his lack of presence in the courtroom where there was no
affirmative defense. And in -- in the record below where
the Florida Supreme Court sent it down to determine
whether or not there was consent, there was no
acquiescence. Mr. Nixon simply did nothing. When -- when
asked -- when Mr. Corin testified and was asked about
whether he discussed the trial strategy and whether Mr.
Nixon agreed or disagreed, Mr. Nixon simply did nothing.
He -- he didn't acquiesce to the strategy.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Tillinghast, can I ask you
if you are familiar with the Loeb/Leopold trial many, many
years ago that was conducted by Clarence Darrow? If
you're not, I won't push you on it.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Unfortunately, I'm not, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Because he he applied
exactly this strategy and it was one of his great
victories. In -- in fact, it's a long, long time ago.
But that was the way Clarence Darrow sized up this very
problem, and the -- and I think in that case they were
very young clients that he had. They didn't -- they were
not -- they did not expressly consent to what he did. But
he saved their lives.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, if -- besides the
what we believe was a fundamental -- what was a complete
failure -- excuse me. Aside from the guilty plea, what we
submit is a guilty plea, we believe that when these kinds
of statements were made, Your Honor, without the consent,
that the advocacy system that was envisioned in Cronic
completely failed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a question that
I asked the other side? And that is, if we don't accept
your argument, if we think when the client is silent, the
lawyer must exercise his best judgment and not assume that
the client would give an answer that would jeopardize the
client's position, if that's the position that this Court
adopts, what would you say is left over for remand? Is it
simply that the Florida Supreme Court then takes the
record as it is and determines under Strickland whether
there was effective -- ineffective performance?
MR. TILLINGHAST: The -- yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be -- that would
be all.
So what do we do with, in the brief, all this
information about things that the lawyer should have done
by way of cross examination? That wasn't put in the
record earlier --
MR. TILLINGHAST: When I say yes, the -- what
would -- what would be left is an entire hearing on the --
on the Strickland claims and the motion to vacate. That
-- that would be the remaining part of the case --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why do we need a hearing
rather than an examination of the record? Tell me why.
MR. TILLINGHAST: Because the -- the hearings
below, when it was sent back down by the Florida Supreme
Court, were only on the issue of whether or not there was
consent to -- to the -- what the Florida Supreme Court
deemed to be the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.
There was not a hearing on the balance of the issues, and
it was strictly limited to that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Hadn't there been a hearing on
those issues on the way up?
MR. TILLINGHAST: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No?
MR. TILLINGHAST: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't --
MR. TILLINGHAST: It was actually denied by
Judge Hall. So the only thing that's -- that's occurred
is the hearing strictly on whether or not there was -- was
consent.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why was it denied in the
trial court? Why was the introduction of what the lawyer
might have done --
MR. TILLINGHAST: It was -- it was because of
the focus of the Florida Supreme Court on -- on whether or
not there was a consent.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No. We're talking below.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. We're talking about the
trial court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking below on the way
up to the Florida Supreme Court. I assume that -- that he
raised below the issue of inadequate performance of
counsel and he had his opportunity to introduce whatever
evidence he had on that subject on the way up to the
Florida Supreme Court.
MR. TILLINGHAST: He --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why the Florida
Supreme Court should be obliged to remand it in order to
give him a second bite at the apple.
MR. TILLINGHAST: It was raised but -- but he
was not given an opportunity for a hearing on that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, was he denied the
opportunity?
MR. TILLINGHAST: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Did the -- did the judge say,
look, we're -- we're going to confine it strictly to this
one issue?
MR. TILLINGHAST: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. TILLINGHAST: So, in conclusion, Your
Honors, we submit that there are two -- two approaches to
affirming the Florida Supreme Court. First is -- is that
it was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea without
consent. The second is that because of the nature of the
statements, it was a complete failure of the advocacy
process where the State's case was not tested in any way.
In fact, as I mentioned, there were 35 witnesses. There
were five very perfunctory questions asked such as what
date was it and when did certain things occur. There was
not the material testing of the record to determine the
truth, which is what is -- is involved in the Sixth
Amendment.
And none of -- none of the challenges, that are
pointed out in -- to the facts in our brief ever came out
because that there was no testing. Simply we have an
opening statement where counsel says the State will prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that these events occurred.
Then we have virtually no cross examination. We have no
witnesses called by the State -- excuse me -- by -- by the
defendant throughout the entire guilt phase of the trial.
And in fact, at one point, the -- the trial judge stopped
asking -- asking Mr. Corin if he wished to cross examine.
And then we have the closing statement where Mr.
Corin stated that the State has proven beyond a reasonable
doubt that -- that he is -- Mr. Nixon was guilty of the
crimes.
And all the while during that guilt phase, Mr.
Nixon was not present in the courtroom. So he had no
ability to object to the opening or the closing statements
because he wasn't here -- there to hear them.
And further, as -- as the record indicates,
there are issues of -- of Mr. Nixon's competency, that
he's mentally retarded. His own lawyer referred to him as
nuts. His own lawyer also referred to him as an ogre in
his closing argument. These are the types of statements,
we would submit, are even if they are not the
functional equivalent of a guilty plea without consent,
they -- they substantially and completely destroy the
advocacy process. So there is no testing, and under
Cronic, the Court should affirm also.
Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Tillinghast.
Mr. Lemieux, you have about 4 minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. LEMIEUX
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEMIEUX: Thank you, Justice Stevens.
I'd like to point this Court to page 486 of the
joint appendix where Mr. Corin is asked, do you feel in
this case that you were put in a position that you had to
make decisions because your client did nothing? And he
said, yes, sir. There is ample evidence in the post-
trial proceedings that Mr. Corin wanted the help of his
client. He did not want to be on the bridge of the ship
alone, but Mr. Nixon abandoned the ship. And although he
consulted with his client at least three times on this
trial strategy, there was no input back that would have
given him any reason to believe that Mr. Nixon did not
want him to go forward to pursue a strategy that Mr.
Corin, in his experience of 14 years as a lawyer, after
having taken 52 depositions in this case, believed was in
the best interest of his client.
I just have a couple of points I'd like to make.
There was a question that was asked about whether or not
the -- the guilt phase and the penalty phase are distinct
parts of a trial. This Court has addressed that in the
Monj v. California case when it said that it's really one
trial and that issues of guilt and innocence are often, in
a capital trial, still being determined in the penalty
phase of that matter.
I'd also like to mention the point that the
counsel made about Cronic. Counsel would ask, as the
Florida Supreme Court did, to apply Cronic to this
situation. There is a harmony that exists in this
jurisprudence between Strickland and Cronic. Issues of
trial performance and trial strategy are articulated and
evaluated under Strickland's two-part standard. Questions
of structural defects that infect the process with error
are evaluated under Cronic. And that harmony works in the
system. It allows for the independence and vitality of
counsel to pursue strategies in their clients' best
interests and it also allows when there are structural
defects, for them to be taken care of with the
presumption.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to get to the
point of whether there was, indeed, an opportunity for
this defendant to introduce evidence about inadequate
performance of counsel?
MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, I am, Your Honor, and I'll
get to that right now. There was ample opportunity.
There were three hearings. And in fact, there was
disagreement between the sides as to whether or not there
was this opportunity for a Strickland hearing. We don't
have Strickland hearings --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what did the judge --
what did judge say? Your brother said the judge said, no,
I won't hear this.
MR. LEMIEUX: Your Honor, I would point the
Court to pages 385 to 390 of the appendix where Judge
Smith denies the Strickland claim.
The defense has the burden of proving
ineffective assistance of counsel. During the first
hearing, there was an issue as to whether or not it was an
ineffective counsel hearing because it was still on direct
appeal. But certainly in hearings two and three, there
was ample opportunity to put that evidence on the record,
and they didn't take that opportunity. Now, they quibbled
and said they didn't have notice and they didn't know that
they were supposed to be here for a Strickland hearing.
We disagree with that because there aren't Strickland
hearings, there are not Cronic hearings.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why should -- why should they
put in Strickland evidence if they've won under Cronic?
MR. LEMIEUX: Well, they had not yet won under
Cronic, Your Honor. They were still making those
arguments.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought it was remanded for
an issue -- for a hearing on the consent issue after --
MR. LEMIEUX: This is -- there was a hearing
before that and a hearing after that.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I see.
MR. LEMIEUX: In conclusion, Your Honor, we
believe that the harmony between these two lines of cases
works, that the Florida Supreme Court got it wrong, and
for that reason, we would request reversal.
Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 10:58 a.m., the case in the
