CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 13-1421, Bank of
America v. Caulkett, and the consolidated case.
Ms. Spinelli.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. SPINELLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Respondents' position is that Section 506(d)
of the Bankruptcy Code allows Chapter 7 debtors to keep
their houses, strip their underwater mortgages, and
prevent their lenders from accessing any later
appreciation in a house's value.  In Dewsnup, this Court
rejected that position with respect to partially
underwater mortgages and that reasoning applies with
equal force to completely underwater mortgages.
Dewsnup held that Section 506(d) voids only
liens securing disallowed claims.  It does not void
liens based on the current value of the collateral.
That logic applies whether the current value of the
collateral is a million dollars, $1 or zero, as
virtually every court to address the question has held,
and even the Eleventh Circuit below all but admitted.
Outside bankruptcy, the bank would be
entitled to have its lien stay with the property until
foreclosure or payment in full.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is the value of --
of an -- an under -- completely underwater second
mortgage?  How likely is it that it will ever -- that
the property will ever appreciate to the extent that it
will have real value?
MS. SPINELLI:  Justice Ginsburg, it's quite
likely.  In these two particular cases, to be sure, the
second liens are deeply underwater.  That's not true in
every case and there's no reason to think it's true in
the typical case.
We have -- Bank of America has many cases
pending right now in the Eleventh Circuit.  We have
cases in which the value of the house would need to rise
only by $4,000, where it would need to rise only by
$5,000, and given that we're in the middle of a market
upswing, it's very plausible and very likely that many
of these mortgages will regain equity.
We quote statistics in our opening brief
that show that between 2012 and 2014, the number of
underwater junior mortgages was cut in half from
4.2 million to 2.1 million.  So houses are coming above
water every day.
And what Dewsnup held is that the
lienholder, according to the basic nonbankruptcy
bargain, is entitled to keep its lien until payment in
full or until a lender decides to foreclose.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do the holders of the
second, assuming the second is partially or fully
underwater, ever participate in negotiations with the
property owner and with the holder of the first lien and
say, well, if you keep the property, we'll reduce our
junior lead -- lien by 50 percent?  Is -- is there a
negotiation dynamic that the rule that you propose would
further?
MS. SPINELLI:  Let me be clear about this,
Justice Kennedy, because I think this is important.  In
Chapter 7 bankruptcies, there are no such negotiations.
Chapter 7 is very simple; the debtor turns over his
assets.  To the extent there are any nonexempt,
non-encumbered assets, which there typically are not,
the trustee will sell those assets, distribute the
proceeds to creditors.  The debtor then receives a
discharge of all prepetition debt.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let's just talk
about Chapter 7 because that's what I had in mind.
Suppose it's a close case and they're thinking of maybe
insisting on -- on sale.
Can the junior lienholder say what if -- I'm
not going to prevail in the sale, but I'll -- if you
don't sell, then I'll cut my -- my lien in half on the
chance that it may go up?  I mean, you -- so you
couldn't ever have this negotiated in -- in a Chapter 7?
MS. SPINELLI:  In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy
those negotiations simply don't occur.  If there's
nonexempt equity in the house, the trustee has to sell
the house --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right.
MS. SPINELLI:  -- and distribute the
proceeds.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the trustee doesn't
care, I mean, right?  I mean, his job is done once --
once the bankruptcy is over.  If -- if it goes up, it's
the homeowner who -- who would care.
MS. SPINELLI:  That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And he's not part of the
negotiation.  He's out of it.
MS. SPINELLI:  That's -- that's correct.
Now, if --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  How does
this work?  I'm sorry.  Back up.  You say the trustee
sells it.  How does the mortgage holder in that
situation foreclose?  Meaning if -- if the debtor no
longer owns the property, this doesn't go free and clean
to the purchaser?
MS. SPINELLI:  The way it works, Justice
Sotomayor, is that if there is non-exempt equity in the
house which, of course, was not true in these two cases,
the trustee will sell the house; out of those proceeds,
the trustee will first satisfy the claim of the senior
secured lender.  If there's anything left over, it will
go to the junior secured lender.  If there's not, the
junior lender receives nothing, and the junior lien is
extinguished.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So when does -- do the
facts of this case matter?
MS. SPINELLI:  The facts of this --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because this is before
the -- the finished -- the wrapping-up of the plan;
right?
MS. SPINELLI:  In Chapter 7 there is no
plan.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  This is
before the bankruptcy is terminated.
MS. SPINELLI:  I think it's important to
understand that Chapter 7 bankruptcies happen very
quickly.  A no-asset bankruptcy like this one will
usually be wrapped up in 30 to 45 days.  Whereas here,
there's no equity in the property to be distributed to
creditors, and there are no other non-exempt assets,
there's really not very much for the trustee to do.  The
trustee will file a notice that the case is
administered, and at that point, a house that's in a
situation of these two houses, in which there is no
non-exempt, non-encumbered value, will be abandoned to
the debtor.
At that point, the debtor's rights in the
property are precisely what they were before bankruptcy.
If the debtor is in default on his mortgage, then the
lenders can foreclose.  If the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let me follow up to
something Justice Kennedy -- many of -- your adversary
plus many others, amici, have argued that if we rule in
the way that you seek, that wholly underwater junior
liens are going to be a holdup, and you are going to use
it as hostage value, and they point to various
situations in which that has occurred.
That, to me, is a concerning policy issue,
so explain why that's not true.
MS. SPINELLI:  Justice Sotomayor, my answer
to that would be that's not a bankruptcy problem.  There
are not negotiations that take place in Chapter 7 as to
which the junior lienholder could exercise any holdup
value.
It's – it’s  certainly may be the case that
later on the debtor may want to negotiate a modification
with its senior lender.  That happens all the time to
people who have been through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and
people who have not.  And to the extent there's a
housing policy issue, I don't think that's properly
addressed through interpretation of the bankruptcy code.
One of the amici --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the bankruptcy
code -- code wants to give debtors a fresh start.
MS. SPINELLI:  That is true.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And to the extent that
Chapter 7 is an attempt to do that, if you're able to
hold up that fresh start, that is the concern
they're -- they're pointing to.
MS. SPINELLI:  Justice Sotomayor, the fresh
start that's given to debtors in Chapter 7 has a
particular nature.  The nature of the fresh start in
Chapter 7 is that the debtor surrenders all of his or
her assets and in return gets a discharge of all
pre-petition debt.  It's never been the case that the
Chapter 7 fresh start has encompassed an ability to
retain property and also strip off liens on that
property.
If the debtor wanted -- and this -- this
doesn't force the debtor to stay in a house that he or
she can't afford.  If the debtor -- if the debtor wanted
to, say, cure a default on his mortgage and keep the
house, Chapter 13 is open to the debtor which permits
curing a default on a mortgage and maintaining payments
during the course of the plan.
Under Chapter 7, a debtor can, if the debtor
is in the situation of these debtors and the house has
been abandoned back to the debtor -- if the debtor is
in -- is current on its loans can keep the house, pay
its mortgage going forward, and be in the same situation
that he was prior to bankruptcy.  The one thing that
Chapter 7 gives a debtor in that situation is that it
discharges the debtor of any personal liability for the
mortgage debt, so the lender cannot come after the
debtor personally.  If the debtor decides that the house
is too expensive for him to stay in, he can stop paying
the mortgage and the only recourse that the lender then
has is to foreclose.
So there -- there certainly is an ability
for debtors to walk away from houses that they simply
can't afford, and there is also an ability through
Chapter 13 to cure existing defaults and reach an
arrangement for which the debtor can keep the house.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Spinelli, I -- I
dissented in Dewsnup, and I continue to believe that
dissent was correct.  Why should I not limit Dewsnup to
the facts that it involved, which is a partially
underwater mortgage?
MS. SPINELLI:  Justice Scalia, I don't think
that can be done coherently given the reasoning of
the Court in Dewsnup.  But what the Court held in
Dewsnup is that Section 506(d) --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, I understand that, but
I think the reasoning was wrong, and -- and very often,
we -- we adhere to a prior decision that -- that, on the
facts of that case -- and Dewsnup did -- did say, you know,
we're just limiting it to the facts of this case, and
we're not saying what these terms mean elsewhere in the
Bankruptcy Act.  So let's take Dewsnup at its word and
just limit it to what it involved, which was a partially
under -- underwater mortgage.  Now, why shouldn't I do
that?
MS. SPINELLI:  I don't believe that's
logically possible even if Dewsnup was wrongly decided
because Dewsnup interpreted a specific phrase in a
specific place in the code.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that.  But we
often limit prior decisions to their facts and don't
follow their logic.
MS. SPINELLI:  Yes, Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If we followed their logic,
we would -- we would never be able to do what I'm
suggesting.  But we often say, yes, the logic would lead
us here, but it was a terrible decision, and we're not
going -- we're not going to extend it any further.  Why
would that be a bad idea here?
MS. SPINELLI:  In this situation, we're
talking about an interpretation of language in a
specific place in a statute, and to do that would be to
read the exact same language in the exact same place in
the statute to mean different things --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right, I'm just not
getting through to you.  I'm willing to do that.  I'm
willing to do that when -- when the language was read
incorrectly the first time.
MS. SPINELLI:  Okay.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But as a practical
matter -- I'm talking as a practical matter and stare
decisis is a very practical doctrine.  Why -- why
should, as a practical matter, should I ad -- adhere
to an opinion that I think was wrong?
MS. SPINELLI:  Well, I do think
Clark v. Martinez would apply in this situation and
present -- prevent a barrier to doing that.  But in
addition --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is -- what is
Hart -- what is the case that you just cited?
MS. SPINELLI:  I apologize, Justice
Ginsburg.  That is one of the cases in which the Court
has said that the same language in the same place in the
same statute cannot mean different things in different
factual circumstances.
JUSTICE ALITO:  There is a dissenting
opinion in a different area of the law on taxpayer
standard under the Establishment Clause, a brilliant
dissenting opinion that you might want to rely on in
this context.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  I've never been able to
figure out the answer to question he raises which is I
take a dissenting opinion in one case, and then when do
I say, okay, forget it?
MS. SPINELLI:  Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- and the answer is
sort of personal, in a way.  How strongly do you feel,
given the need of the law, to advise the lawyers, advise
judges, advise Congress and others?  If we all keep
dissenting all the time, it will be chaos.  If we never
change, you can't stick to a principle.  If you have
found any way of drawing that line, I -- I don't think
there is a way --
MS. SPINELLI:  I think -- I think there is,
Justice Breyer and Justice Scalia, which is that, I
mean, this Court has very rarely taken the step of
overruling a statutory interpretation decision.
Certainly never in the kind of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not talking about
overruling.  I'm saying subsist as far as partially
underwater mortgages are concerned.  The issue before us
is whether we should extend it to totally underwater.
Now, I thought you were going to tell me,
you know, I feel strongly that -- that Dewsnup was
wrong, but I'm not going to upset expectations.  I mean,
if banks have been, you know, lending money for second
mortgages on the assumption that they would not be
stripped, I mean, that's what I thought you were going
to tell me.  Oh, you know, many expectations that have
been rested upon this -- this misbegotten opinion of
Dewsnup.
MS. SPINELLI:  It's -- it's certainly been
the case that since Dewsnup was decided until this
decision by the Eleventh Circuit in 2012, it was -- it
was well-established that Dewsnup applied equally to
completely underwater.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Spinelli-
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And – and are you saying,
then, that there have been substantial reliance on the
Dewsnup interpretation that you are supporting here by
banks that have given second mortgages all over the
country, huge reliance that would be upset.
MS. SPINELLI:  I have been relying --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I thought that that's
what you were going to say to Justice Scalia, and I
don't -- I don't hear that being argued.
MS. SPINELLI:  I believe that there has been
reliance.  I actually don't think that's the most
compelling argument as to why the Court shouldn't depart
from Dewsnup.
The language in Dewsnup simply can't be read
to distinguish between completely and partially --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but if we could go
back -- I mean, I kind of agree with you that it's not a
very compelling argument, this reliance argument,
because I find myself in the same position as Justice
Scalia.  I read the two Dewsnup opinions, and it seems
to me that Justice Scalia clearly has the better of the
argument.  And then --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And then the question is,
what do we do about that and where do we go from there.
And it does strike me that if -- you know, these are the
most sophisticated parties that can possibly be
imagined, Bank of America and other banks, and it seems
to me that they would be making essentially a bet on --
and they would, you know, think about all the things --
what is the probability that Dewsnup will be extended to
completely underwater mortgages.
And presumably, they discounted all their
various calculations in order to take into account the
probability that another court would say, you know,
Dewsnup is not very persuasive, and we're just not
willing to extend it any further.  And I think that's
probably what Bank of America and other banks did, is
they said, you know, we think there is X percent chance
that Dewsnup will be extended and Y percent chance that
it won't, and they made their cost and pricing
calculations based on that calculation.
So if that's the case, why should we worry
about reliance?
MS. SPINELLI:  Justice Kagan, I do believe
that banks have relied on the Dewsnup decision.  As to
whether they specifically made calculations about when
it would apply -- whether it would apply in these
circumstances, I don't know.  But I think I would go
back to the premise of your question, which is that this
would be extending Dewsnup.  It – it wouldn't be
extending Dewsnup.  It would simply be applying Dewsnup
to a set of facts in which the interpretation the Court
gave in Dewsnup is equally applicable.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though Dewsnup
itself said no, we're deciding this case only, and not
any other.  I think in -- in your brief, you did make
the point that Dewsnup is now how many years old?
MS. SPINELLI:  It's almost 25 years old,
Justice Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And Congress could have
changed it if it didn't like it, and Congress has
amended the code.
MS. SPINELLI:  That's -- that's correct.  I
mean, Congress has amended the code substantially both
in 1994 and in 2005.  In 1994, Congress overruled or
modified a couple of these courts' bankruptcy decisions.
It overruled Rake v. Wade.  It modified the statute in
response to this Court's decision in Nobelman.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that proves, at most,
that Congress liked Dewsnup as applied to partially
underwater mortgages; isn't that right?  I mean, that's
all it proves.  They let it -- they let it stand.  They
did not overrule Dewsnup as far as partially underwater
mortgages.  It doesn't say anything about how they feel
about totally underwater mortgages.
MS. SPINELLI:  Justice Scalia, there is
simply no distinction that can be drawn between
partially and completely underwater liens in this
situation.  Dewsnup held that a secured claim is a claim
secured by a lien with recourse to the underlying
collateral.  That is equally applicable here.
Likewise, I mean, the text of Section 506
certainly draws no such distinction, so it would be an
odd thing to do to vindicate textualism to adopt the
proposition that Respondents are advancing here.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You really know how to hurt
a fellow, don't you?
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, I understand
the notion and agree with it completely that if you have
a decision that's wrong, you don't extend it in any way.
But there are factual distinctions and there are factual
distinctions.  I mean, Dewsnup may have been decided on
a Tuesday, and this case could be decided on a Thursday,
but you would not say, you know, we're not extending it
-- you know, we're simply not going to extend it to
other cases.
MS. SPINELLI:  Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And in this
particular instance, I assume the difference between
underwater and -- and totally -- partially underwater
and totally underwater is a completely -- a completely
fluid one in the sense that at the start of -- the start
of the bankruptcy -- I didn't think of that one.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That was totally
unintended.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But -- but the idea
is that, you know, throughout a bankruptcy, you could
have a mortgage that is -- a lien that's underwater,
then totally underwater, then partially underwater.  And
the idea that you'd latch onto that as a distinction
seems to me to be a difficult proposition .
MS. SPINELLI:  That's exactly right.  I
mean, the nonbankruptcy right of a lienholder is to
retain its lien until payment in full or until
foreclosure, which means that the lienholder is entitled
to access any equity that may develop in the future due
to appreciation of the property to secure its lien.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is this -- is this right?
I want to be sure I understand.  Under Dewsnup, the last
25 years, lenders and others in the bankruptcy community
have understand -- understood the way it works is the
following:  If you have a lien and the house is worth
500,000 and your -- your lien is secured and it's worth
a million, and they're in Chapter 7, you have a secured
interest and they're counted as a secured creditor only
to 500,000.  As to the remaining 500,000, you're counted
as an unsecured creditor, but you keep the lien.
MS. SPINELLI:  Right.  Well, but --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And so therefore, if when
they're out of bankruptcy someday or the house goes up,
or whatever it is, you still have your lien.  Is that
right?
MS. SPINELLI:  That's right.  And let me
explain that, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  I mean, I don't --
MS. SPINELLI:  Section 506 --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I just wanted to be sure it
was right, but if you'd like to explain it further, do.
MS. SPINELLI:  It -- it is right, and I --
and I would, if I might.  Section 506(a) bifurcates
under secured claims into a secured portion and an
unsecured portion, and that determines the distribution
that a creditor can get from the estate.
Now, I want to be clear that nothing in the
way this Court reads 506(d) will affect that.  That is
going to be true no matter what.  What Dewsnup said is
that Section 506(d) does not refer back to that
bifurcation in 506(a).  Rather, it uses the word
"secured" in the ordinary English and ordinary legal
meaning of secured by a lien with recourse to the
underlying collateral.  And in that situation, given
that reading, 506(d) only strips liens securing
disallowed claims.  If the claim is valid, then the
creditor is entitled to --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That means that after
bankruptcy's over and you're back out of Section 7 --
Chapter 7, your lien -- unless it falls within one of
the other two exceptions there -- remains.
MS. SPINELLI:  Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And therefore -- and that's
the understanding.  Okay.  I understand.  Thank you.
MS. SPINELLI:  Correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When -- when do trustees
decide that they're not sure of the value of the home
and that they're going to sell it to find out what it's
worth?
MS. SPINELLI:  Typically, the value's not
disputed.  If it’s -- it's usually quite clear whether
there is or is not nonexempt, nonencumbered value in a
house, and the trustee will sell the house only if there
is nonexempt, nonencumbered value.
The -- you know, it's possible that in a
situation in which it's not clear, the trustee might go
ahead and sell the house and see how much is realized
for it, because that sell -- sale price would then by
definition establish the amount of the secured claim.
Typically, in -- you know, typically, in no
asset cases like this, there's simply no issue and
there's no question that the trustee is not going to be
selling the asset.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just -- just getting back
to the reliance point or really, from your argument, the
non-reliance point, the -- your -- your brief talked
about the millions of loans and so forth that have been
made, but you -- you seem to walk away from any reliance
argument.
MS. SPINELLI:  Justice -- Justice Kennedy,
let me be clear.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm really quite surprised
at that.
MS. SPINELLI:  Let me be clear.  I am not
walking away from the argument that the banks have
relied on Dewsnup.  I think that's unquestionably true.
Millions of loans have been made in reliance on
Dewsnup's holding.  Banks, when they make loans, price
them in and extend them based on an understanding of
what their recovery is going to be given default.  That
is true.
What I was responding to is the notion that
banks may have relied on, you know, whether this Court
would apply Dewsnup to completely underwater mortgages.
I think that's a little bit less strong, although it's
true that in the 25 years since Dewsnup, it's -- until
this decision by the Eleventh Circuit, it's been well
established that Dewsnup does apply to completely
underwater liens.
May I reserve the balance of my time?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You may.
MS. SPINELLI:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Bibas.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANOS BIBAS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BIBAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
A claim unsupported by any value is a
completely unsecured claim under Section 506(a).  An
unsecured claim cannot be an allowed secured claim, and
its associated lien is void under Section 506(d).
Claims with some value remain secured.  Claims with no
value don't.  They would be wiped out in foreclosure,
and bankruptcy treats them no better than foreclosure
would.
But before I get to text or holdup value or
Dewsnup, let me seize on the striking concession of my
adversary.  Justices Scalia and Kagan pressed my
adversary who conceded that she couldn't demonstrate
reliance here.  There were bankruptcy courts and
district courts that foreshadowed the ruling below, and
they pointed to no evidence of reliance.  There is -- we
challenged in our brief to show that in the Eleventh
Circuit lending markets were being affected.  No
evidence.  There are eight circuits in which lien
voiding is allowed in Chapter 13.  No evidence.  We
should clear the table of a reliance argument that my
adversary all but concedes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  How -- how -- she didn't
concede it, and -- and it just seems -- you know, it's
not just homeowners.  You can cure me of this
misapprehension, but probably in the last 25 years or
30 years, there have been trillions of dollars that have
been loaned to businesses.  I mean, think of Lehman
Brothers, and -- and they go bankrupt, and suddenly at
stake are -- are hundreds of billions of dollars.  And a
person who has made a mortgage, at least a lawyer would
say, okay, you can lend the money; if things go badly,
we can keep the lien.  We won't collect because he is
bankrupt, but markets go up and down.  Keep -- keep --
keep the secured interest, they might go back up, you
might get it some day.
Now, that's perfectly obvious advice, it
seems to me, from what I know so far.
So -- so when you do that, the mortgage
lender has to decide what the interest rate is, how --
what the terms are, and it's pretty hard to believe
there isn't some effect on the brain of the -- of the
person who is making the mortgage from the simple fact
that he gets to keep that lien, it passes through
bankruptcy, and eventually the market may go back up.
MR. BIBAS:  In addition to Justice Kagan's
answer, which is the banks are well advised and can
forecast, they can read the text of the statute and
Dewsnup's express --
JUSTICE BREYER:  We have -- we have had
25 years or 30 years -- 23 years to be exact, and I --
and -- and the -- the fact is that, sure, they go to
their lawyer -- they don't -- the lawyers, and the
lawyers would read and the lawyers would say.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I --
MR. BIBAS:  Well, I direct the Court to the
Levitin amicus brief.  There are two empirical studies
that found natural experiments.  One of them involved
differences in circuits before Nobelman in Chapter 13
lien voiding which found a very slight effect, 0.12 to
0.18 percent, on first mortgages.  The other, an
empirical study by Philadelphia Federal Reserve
economists, likewise found no substantial effect on
markets even when different circuits adopted --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It -- it -- it's hard --
it's hard for me to think that a decision in your favor
wouldn't, in a sense, hurt borrowers because the market
for a second is going to dry up or become much more
expensive.  I -- I'll read the briefs and you can tell
me about why that theory, economic theory, might be
wrong, but it seems to me just common sense.
MR. BIBAS:  Justice Kennedy, the Levitin
amicus brief explains in greater detail, but there is a
problem in the mortgage market in that first mortgagees
and debtors often want to work out mutually beneficial
resolutions.  As my adversary concedes, no negotiation
goes on in bankruptcy.  The second can prevent this from
happening, and we've cited multiple studies that show
that the second lenders may wind up forcing homes into
foreclosure.
The other point that the Levitin brief makes
is that this is primarily a problem with the housing
bubble.  This is a problem of very high loan-to-value,
piggyback second mortgages.  They found no evidence of
an effect on low loan-to-value home improvement, home
equity lines of credit of the sort that survive now that
the regulatory --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I would agree that
their bargaining club might be too big in some
instances, the -- the bargaining club of -- of the
second.  On the other hand, it does seem to me that
there is room in close cases for a three-way compromise.
I'm -- I'm advised that that just doesn't happen in
Chapter 7.  I find that hard to believe, but especially
in major bankruptcies, not homeowner bankruptcy.
MR. BIBAS:  Two responses, Justice Kennedy.
The first part of your question was, well, what is the
effect on mortgage lending?  Even if there were an
effect on second mortgage lending, one has to balance
that against maximizing the value of first mortgages,
which are purchase money mortgages which are helped by
unclogging the housing market.  The chief economist at
Moody's Analytics said that resolving subordinate liens
was the biggest obstacle to the housing recovery.
Then your second question is, well, what
about loan modifications and bargaining.  My answer
there is this administration had a number or programs in
place after the housing bubble; HAMP and HARP were these
mortgage -- mortgage modification programs.  The take-up
rate on those were very disappointing, much lower than
the administration expected because of this holdup power
that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is this all about
housing?  Why isn't it about -- maybe it is.  I'm -- I'm
expecting an answer.  Why -- why is it just about
housing?  Why isn't it about Lehman Brothers?  Why isn't
about it about businesses?  Why isn't it about
commercial property?
MR. BIBAS:  Because currently, in Chapter 11
in -- in cramdown reorganizations and the like, similar
lien voiding already happens when there is no value to
be -- to secure it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's statutorily.
MR. BIBAS:  Right, statutorily is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, where in any
statute in 11 or 13 did Congress ever use the word
voiding a lien as opposed to stripping down a lien?
MR. BIBAS:  It -- it doesn't use the phrase
stripping down.  It doesn't use the phrase void,
Justice Sotomayor.  And this is very important.  The
NACBA brief goes into this.  There are references to
retaining liens, to satisfying liens, to modifying
liens.  But as NACBA explains, those provisions all
piggyback on 506, which values a claim.  It goes over
for adjudication in Chapter 11, the different classes of
creditors, and then back to 506(d) which is the
provision that says that it voids liens.  And NACBA's
fear is that if this Court does not allow Section 506(d)
to do what it's supposed to do, it could impair not only
housing mortgage modifications, but business
bankruptcy --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, yes, but no.  I'm --
I'm not -- I just want to understand it.  I'm --
housing -- I'm a mall.  I'm Lehman Brothers.
MR. BIBAS:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I go bankrupt.  There are
all kinds of liens all over the place.  Doesn't the same
law apply to them --
MR. BIBAS:  Well, Section 1129  --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- as to housing?
MR. BIBAS:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's a general question.
MR. BIBAS:  There -- there is.  And if
it's -- if it's Lehman Brothers, if it's a Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization --
JUSTICE BREYER :  No, no.  But assume a big
business in Chapter 7.
MR. BIBAS:  Yes.  Businesses under Chapter 7
do not receive a discharge, and so typically the
business is filing under Chapter 11.  If there is a
liquidation, you are right, though, that the same logic
could apply there.  And whether it a business bankruptcy
or it's a mortgage, a home bankruptcy, there is still
the need for the bankruptcy code's policies of finality
and a fresh start.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You know, I -- I'm not
familiar with the widespread practice of giving -- of
taking a second mortgage on a business loan unless it's
your father-in-law.  It's -- it's a very common practice
for -- for purchases of homes.  I -- I -- I'm not aware
that it's a common practice in businesses, getting --
getting second mortgages.  I -- it seems to me quite
rare.
MR. BIBAS:  But there are different tranches
of debt sometimes, senior and junior debt obligations,
that would be analogous.  But you're right.
Numerically, this is going to be a huge issue in -- in
the housing market.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Bibas, I'm – I’m really
not a poor loser and -- and, you know --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- I've -- I've lost in
Dewsnup.  What I am concerned about is the -- what
should I say -- the ridiculousness of saying if under
Dewsnup -- and you haven't asked us to overrule Dewsnup
-- under Dewsnup, if -- if there's $1 worth of value,
okay, you don't lose your lien.  But if there is zero
value, $1 less and it's stripped entirely, it seems to
me a -- a very strange -- strange outcome.  Why would
any intelligent system want to produce an outcome like
that?
MR. BIBAS:  I'll talk about that doctrinally
and then as a policy matter.  Doctrinally, the code has
dozens of provisions that turn on a dollar difference in
eligibility for Chapter 7 or presumptions of abuse of a
like.  Congress draws these lines.  Section 1111(b) for
business bankruptcies and reorganizations talks about
inconsequential value.  You keep your lien if it has
some value.  If it doesn't --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You think this is a line
that Congress drew, right?
MR. BIBAS:  Well, Congress drew the
other provisions.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Congress intentionally
wanted Dewsnup for partially underwater and really
doesn't want Dewsnup for totally underwater.  Come on.
MR. BIBAS:  I didn't say that, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.
MR. BIBAS:  I -- I'd remind Your Honor of --
of your opinion in Green v. Bock Laundry.  If it's
necessary to deviate from the text, which Dewsnup
admitted it was deviating from the text, pick the
deviation that does the least violence to the text, that
minimizes the amount of the deviation.  We preserve a
link and Dewsnup did not completely sever the
link between 506(a)'s requirement --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It may take the least
violence from the text, but it leaves, as Justice Scalia
suggested, absolutely draconian arbitrary results.
MR. BIBAS:  Okay.  As a policy matter,
Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And his opinion didn't say
that you do that.
MR. BIBAS:  No.  Your Honor, I don't believe
it's draconian.  If a property is $1 above water, okay,
it is preserved under this reading of Dewsnup.  But we’ve
explained in our brief that foreclosure sale at deep
discounts, there are high transaction costs.  So a house
might have to rise by half or more in value before
there's any additional money on the table.  So if
anything, allowing preservation of a lien that has $1 in
nominal value is being somewhat overprotective, erring
on the side of being generous and protective when there
would be no money left in foreclosure.  What it does is
it clears out the liens that are nowhere close to having
value in foreclosure.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Isn't the question
complicated by the fact that whether it's $1 above or $1
below is a matter of a fairly subjective valuation by
the court?
MR. BIBAS:  On the contrary, Your Honor,
Section 506(a) expressly provides for judicial
valuation.  Nobelman recognized it would be judicial
valuation.  The house reports recognized it would be
judicial.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, no, I know it's
judicial valuation, but that's -- that's the problem.
If you're cutting a fine line and saying it's up to the
judge who can look ahead and say, well, this is going to
happen in the bankruptcy, and I'm worried about that.
No one's going to say a valuation at $50,001 is
accurate, but 49,999 is not.  But that is in control of
the judge who's doing the valuation.
MR. BIBAS:  Yes.  But it's far more accurate
than the realistic alternative of foreclosure.  There
are many more safeguards.  One can -- the creditor can
submit a proposed valuation.  A creditor submits
appraisals, expert testimony, there is a hearing.  And
that is far more protected than foreclosures which have
to have -- be rushed sales, poor notice, poorly
advertised, they require cash sales, that leave the
creditor much less protection.
The realistic alternative here is throwing
the house into foreclosure, and -- and outside a
bankruptcy and then, in fact, the creditor winds up
worse off.  Not just the second, who has nothing to gain
and nothing to lose, holds it up, the first mortgagee
winds up losing value.
If I might now take the Court back to the
text of the statute.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Bibas, before you do,
could I go back to something that the Chief asked
about -- that the Chief Justice asked about earlier,
which is this question of whether a distinction between
fully underwater and partially underwater is coherent at
all.
Here's what Dewsnup said.  Dewsnup on the
one hand said, we're deciding this case and this case
only.  But it also said this, this is how it framed its
holding.  "We hold that 506(d) does not allow petitioner
to strip down respondent's lien because respondent's
lien" -- excuse me -- "because respondent's claim is
secured by a lien and has been fully allowed pursuant to
502."
So this claim, too, is secured by a lien and
has been fully allowed pursuant to 502.  It seems to
come within this statement of the holding.  And I guess
the question is, you know, how -- how is it that we can
say that this is a sensical distinction at all given
that holding?
MR. BIBAS:  Two ways.  Let me focus on that
sentence and then things elsewhere in the opinion and
then Nobelman.
That sentence was careful, unusually
careful, to phrase the holding in terms of the
particular parties.  That respondent had value in the
mortgage.  That's why the Court said respondent's claim,
not claims in general.  Then it used the verb "stripped
down."  That's bankruptcy jargon for a partially secured
mortgage and reducing the amount, scaling down the
indebtedness, the court said two days later.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I hear you, but it
seems as though it's the second half of the sentence
that is key here.  Why are we doing this?  Why are we
holding this?  Because the claim is secured by a lien
and because the claim has been fully allowed.  And both
of those things also apply here.
MR. BIBAS:  Respondent's claim also had some
value that made it unquestionable that it was still
secured.  But you're -- you're correct.  I think,
though, that the use of the verb "stripped down" and the
use of the respondent particular limits to that
situation.
It's very important, though, to go back
three sentences before that to see what the court
hedged.  The court specifically reserved hypothetical
applications advanced at oral argument.  Petitioner
advanced two hypotheticals at oral argument.  One of
those was of the completely underwater junior mortgage.
The court said that those hypotheticals illustrate the
difficulty of the broad creditors in government's rule,
the same rule that Ms. Spinelli says that the court
embraces.  The same rule she quoted during her argument
as if it were the court's holding, about, well, there's
some collateral, therefore, it's secured.
The court declined to rule on all possible
fact situations, in light of that hypothetical, and it
said we, therefore, focus on the case before us and
allow other facts to await their legal resolution.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why haven't you argued
that we should overrule Dewsnup?  Is it because of
reliance, because you think that there has been a great
deal of reliance on Dewsnup as applied to a partially
underwater mortgage, but not reliance as applied to
totally underwater?
MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor, it's quite right
that those are two different categories.  It's not our
burden to take on steri decisis because we win under
Dewsnup.  Either way, the Court can do what it wants,
but we have not advocated it.  We've been faithful to
Dewsnup's holding and its reasoning, including the
express limitations it put on its reasoning.  Its
reasoning was limited to a case with some value.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the law would be much
more coherent if either Dewsnup applies to the totally
underwater as well as partially underwater, or Dewsnup
is overruled.
MR. BIBAS:  I don't believe that's the
case -- in terms of -- while the Court could consider
overruling Dewsnup, we haven't advocated for that.
Because even -- our reading of the statute is still more
faithful to the text than Petitioner's.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, you're giving
the same -- exactly the same phrase in the statute two
different meanings, depending on whether one's
underwater or not, completely or partially.
MR. BIBAS:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where do you find that
distinction in 506?
MR. BIBAS:  Okay.  Section 506(a) defines
what an allowed secured claim is.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  But that's the
argument that Justice Scalia made that was rejected.
You're giving the same phrase two different meanings.
How do you apply the meaning in Dewsnup to
this case?
MR. BIBAS:  On -- on 506(d).  Dewsnup was
interpreting a claim that was a -- it was a hybrid.  It
was -- it had a secured claim component and an unsecured
claim component.  The secured claim component had some
value.  That value was sufficient under 506(a) that
there was a partial-- partial secured claim.
Dewsnup must be read in light of Nobelman a
year later.  Nobelman said there's a secured -- it's a
Chapter 13 case, but it interprets 506 which applies
across the code.  Nobelman said there's a secured claim
component, there's an unsecured claim component.  The
creditors in Nobelman advanced the same argument, the
same argument that my adversary advances, which is 506
is just about priority and distribution.  That it has
nothing to do with lien voiding, Dewsnup resolved this
issue, every claim that is secured by a lien is secured
by a --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But Nobelman was not
about 506.  It was about 1322.  And 1322 talks about the
bankruptcy court's power to modify the rights of any
creditor, whether it's secured or unsecured.  That's how
it's been read by the courts.
MR. BIBAS:  Yes.  But 1322's operative
phrase is "modifying the rights of holders of secured
claims."  In order to be a holder of secured claim, one
must have a secured claim.  And so in Nobelman, this
Court stressed petitioners were correct in looking to
Section 506(a) for a judicial valuation of the
collateral to determine the status of the bank's secured
claim, whether there was a secured claim or not.  There
was a secured claim component, and so the Court said the
bank is still the holder of a secured claim because
Petitioner's home retains $23,500 of collateral.
So the issue in Nobelman, as in Dewsnup,
was, okay, we have a secured claim component under Rumph
here -- we have an unsecured claim component.  Do we
split the baby?  Do we chop them in half?  And Nobelman
said, no, in part, because it's a difficult thing to --
to change the amortization, the loan term, the payments,
et cetera.  There is some value here that supports this.
So we're going to leave it as indivisible hold.  This
Court could easily understand allowed secured claim in
506(d) if it wished to preserve Dewsnup's holding just
as a binary term.  If there's some --
JUSTICE BREYER:  If you can do that,
linguistically, I can see a difference.  The part that
I'm having a hard time with is if this earlier case
survives.  Let's imagine a commercial loan.  And I put
it in a commercial context, because the numbers -- a
mortgage -- a lender lends $5 million -- the senior
lender -- to a commercial building, which then goes into
the Chapter 7.  The junior lender lends 2 million, so
now he has 7 million.  The property ends up being worth
a million.  So the senior lender under Dewsnup comes in
and says, okay, I have a secured interest for a million,
but I can keep the -- the mortgage here for 4 million,
you know, in case things change ten years from now.
Isn't that under Dewsnup?  The senior guy can, that's
partly --
MR. BIBAS:  Well, in the corporate
bankruptcy, this doesn't apply --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Then I'll say -- I
just want some numbers.  The senior -- the senior person
says -- put it on whatever you want.  The senior person
says, oh, I get to keep my $4 million mortgage.  Maybe
things will change, you know, and eventually I may be
able to collect some.  Right?  That's Dewsnup.
MR. BIBAS:  Except --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Except what?
MR. BIBAS:  The -- the difficulty there --
so you're saying that there's a completely unsecured
second mortgage that the individual --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  No.  I haven't made my
example yet.
MR. BIBAS:  All right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I just want to know if I'm
right so far.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  There's -- there's one
mortgage.  It's $5 million.  The property is worth one.
MR. BIBAS:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And so what happens to --
to bank X is he gets maybe, as a secured creditor, the
million, if he wants, but if he doesn't want to collect
it now, he doesn't have to, and he keeps $5 million.  He
keeps that mortgage going as long as he wants.
MR. BIBAS:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Okay.  So junior
comes in, and junior says, hey, he got to keep 4 million
just in case.  I have my mortgage for two.  Why can't I?
Now -- now, I can -- I can think of some words here that
might say, well, there's the difference, is what you are
pointing to.  I just want to know, in terms of
commercial practice or anything else, what's the answer
to his point?  He got to keep four on the hope it will
go up eventually.  Why can't I keep my two?  My
documents are just as good as his.  My mortgage is just
as good as his.  I mean, why can't I?
MR. BIBAS:  So there is a functional answer,
and a historical answer.  I take it you're interested
more in the functional answer.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. BIBAS:  I'll start there.  There is a
big difference between a single creditor, single debtor
situation.  In Dewsnup, the debtor was just trying to
stop a foreclosure, so the debtor could get a better
deal.  Here we have a multi-creditor situation.  The
creditor -- this junior creditor is seeking a better
outcome than it would get in state law foreclosure.
That better outcome comes in part from hold
up or hostage value that can limit the ability of the
senior lender and the property holder to negotiate a
loan modification, a work out, that makes everybody
better off, makes assets more freely transferable, and
improves the -- the market.  And that does come at the
price of a junior lender, but that's what happens in a
cram down as well.  In a cram down, junior interests are
squeezed out so that the senior people can -- can
maximize the value of the assets and deal with them
freely.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why can't you say the same
thing about only one lender?  He doesn't have to keep
that four, you know.  He could say, give me 30 cents
extra.  I will foreclose today, and -- and there you
are, free, never having this hanging over your head.
And I'll do it for an extra 30 cents, you find it.  Now,
that's called -- the same thing you say -- it's
called -- what did you call it?  Whatever it is.  You
see, people with mortgages can do that.
MR. BIBAS:  Right.  But there's not the same
multi-creditor --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  There is one rather
than two, and maybe two would be better than three, or
three would be better than four.
MR. BIBAS:  Since you are asking
specifically in functional terms -- and I will get to
the bankruptcy history later -- it's -- there is a
coordination problem when -- a coordination problem can
be a game of chicken.  Each of them holding out for more
money and then people -- two people can drive over a
cliff in a game of chicken.
Now, on to the bankruptcy history.  Why is
this relevant to the law?  There's a steady trajectory
in bankruptcy law of increasing lien voiding power.
Under -- in 1934, section 77(b) authorized lien voiding
in business or organizations.  In 1938, the Chandler
Act, Chapter 12, extended that to individual
organizations.  In 1952, the amendments broadened it.
They rejected the absolute priority rule for individual
debtors, so the debtor can hang on to the assets, and
the liens can still be voided.
Then in 1978, the modern code enacted
Section 506, which applies across the code, Chapter 7,
11, 12, and 13.  So this is part of an increasing
recognition over time that it's necessary to solve these
hold up problems.  And the – the realistic alternative --
my -- my friend, Ms. Spinelli, in her reply brief says,
well, if we hang on to this lien, ten years from now,
first, we will keep getting paid down, and then our
second will come into the money.  Right?
Well, that is not realistically what happens
in these cases.  In borderline cases, 105, 110 percent
of loan-to-value, people stay in the houses.  They keep
paying.  It's too much cost to pick up the kids and move
to a different home.  When you get to 130 percent of
loan-to-value, the median home that's underwater with a
second that is underwater is 135 percent loan-to-value.
When you get to 150 percent of
loan-to-value, at those ranges, lots of people are in
default.  They qualify for bankruptcy because they've
lost a job, or they are ill.  They can't make the
payments and pay into a black hole of negative equity.
They walk away.  The home is thrown into foreclosure
anyway, and the senior creditor is worse off.  And the
junior doesn't care because the junior doesn't get
anything either way.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Bibas, can I take you
back to Justice Alito's question, which was about stare
decisis, and why you haven't argued it?  Because I tell
you that my sort of reaction to this case is that these
distinctions that you are drawing between partially
underwater and fully underwater are not terribly
persuasive.  But the only thing that may be less
persuasive is Dewsnup itself.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And so the -- so the
question, to me, is -- or at least one question is
whether we should bite the bullet and overturn Dewsnup,
and maybe you are right, that that's for us to decide.
And you -- but if -- if you do have something relevant
to say about that matter, here's your chance to say it.
MR. BIBAS:  I think it's worth -- if
the Court wishes to consider that, and, again, that's
not been the position we've advocated, because we don't
need it to win.  It's worth starting with Justice
Thomas's concurring opinion in 203 North LaSalle, which
pointed out the massive confusion that has been sewn in
the Court's trying to grapple with this ruling, which
Judge Gorsuch's ruling Woolsey that says that Dewsnup
has lost every away game it's played, that it doesn't
fit with the other provisions of the code.  There is a
lot of confusion there.
It has almost uniform criticism in scholarly
commentary.  My colleague can't point to reliance
interest in the markets.  And the empirical studies
discussed in the Levitin brief suggest that there isn't
substantial reliance on this, in part, because you
benefit from first mortgagees who manage to maximize
their value by voiding some of these junior ones.  And
so the reliance interest that my friend has walked away
from and the uniform criticism of Dewsnup might interest
this Court in considering revisiting it, but it's not
necessary, because Dewsnup itself reserved the
completely underwater hypothetical on the face of its
opinion.
It was exceptionally narrow, and the lawyers
could read and see that it declined to reach this issue.
And I -- I do think that it is very important to -- to
read Dewsnup together with Nobelman, that Dewsnup doesn't
stand on it's own, that Nobelman -- it's true.  It was
under 1322(b)(2).  It was a Chapter 13 case, but it was
fundamentally about interpreting 506(a).  Is it just a
distribution provision, as my client argued --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  What -- what
the Court said -- I don't understand that argument.  It
said there's -- yes, you -- you divide it up to secured
and unsecured, but you treat it all the same.
MR. BIBAS:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what it said.
MR. BIBAS:  You treat it all the same --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.  For
purposes --
MR. BIBAS:  You decline to cut it into
pieces, and one of the reasons that you decline to cut
it into pieces is because the claim secured by a lien
encompasses both secured --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So once -- once
the Court has the power, what it was saying under 1322,
to modify that, then the Court could change both the
secured or -- and I'm -- the whole lien is what it was
talking about.
MR. BIBAS:  But the last part of the opinion
pointed out that if you modify the unsecured portion you
have a ripple effects upon the secured portion.  You
wind up changing things like the -- the interest rate or
the amortization or the fees.  And so you might be
viewed as -- as sabotaging or undermining what deserves
to remain a secured component.  In this situation, there
is no -- no such problem.
So all -- it is worth noting, by the way, my
friend also says, well, this lien, it can sit out there,
maybe it retains value sometime in the future; isn't
that enough value.  And I think Justice Breyer was
gesturing towards that.  All eight circuits after
Nobelman have understood that Nobelman drew a line
between some value and no value.  All eight circuits
that confront lien voiding in Chapter 13 allow it
because they recognize that the completely underwater
junior qualifies as no value within the meaning of the
code.
Present economic value is what this Court's
cases have consistently focused on.  The value of the
claim is equal to the value of the collateral, this
Court has said, and that's the present value of the
collateral.  The statute uses the present tense in
Section 506, whether it is or is not.  It's not about
forecasting or speculating into the future.  That would
be unworkable.  But judicial valuations are workable.
The Bankruptcy Rules, Rule 3012 and 7001 provide for it.
And there is abundant case law that shows it to be both
workable and fairer to creditors than the alternative
which is a foreclosure.
The judgment below should be affirmed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Spinelli, you have 4 minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. SPINELLI:  Thank you.
Just a couple of points.
Completely underwater liens are not
valueless.  Their value stems from the potential for
appreciation in the collateral.
Indeed, a lien that's completely underwater
by a dollar might have more value than a lien that is
supported by a dollar of equity, depending on the
potential for appreciation.
The value if the houses were sold today is
simply irrelevant because the situation only arises
where the debtor is keeping the house.  And one could
have said in Dewsnup, look, the current value of the
collateral is less than the amount of your loan.  It's
fair to give you the current value of -- of the
collateral.
Dewsnup held to the contrary, and that's
precisely the same here.  There is no distinction that
supports drawing a line at completely underwater liens,
given that the secured creditor has the same
nonbankruptcy right to have its lien stay with the
collateral until foreclosure and payment in full and to
realize any appreciation in the value of that
collateral.
This -- this doesn't give a junior
lienholder a better deal than it would receive under
State law.  It gives it the same deal it would receive
under State law.
To respond to a point that I think
Justice Sotomayor made, the fact that there are specific
provisions in Chapters 11 and 13 that do permit
stripping down liens in certain circumstances supports
the Dewsnup Court's view of 506(d).  It certainly
doesn't undermine it.  506(d) is not the provision that
strips down liens in Chapters 11 and 13.  Rather, there
are specific provisions which are in the addendum to our
brief in Section 1325 for Chapter 13, and actually this
is not in the addendum, 1129(b) for Chapter 11.
Those provisions would make no sense if
506(d) were itself a lien-stripping provision.  And just
to take one example, if one looks at Section
1325(a)(5) which appears on page 6A of the blue brief,
that sets out the terms under which a Chapter 13 debtor
can strip down liens, and it says that with respect to
each allowed secured claim provided for by the plan, the
plan provides that the holder of such claim retain the
lien, securing such claim until the earlier of the
payment of the underlying debt determined under
nonbankruptcy law or discharge.
Now, it would make no sense to permit the
lender to keep its lien until payment of the full debt
if the lien had already automatically been stripped down
under 506(d) to the value of the collateral, and that's
just one example.
We discussed some others in our briefs,
including Section 722, and we also discuss in our briefs
the -- the textual indications in Section 506 that
support the Dewsnup's Court's holding.  So -- and those
are all reasons why Dewsnup was correctly decided in the
first instance and shouldn't be overruled.
But to respond to Justice Kagan's question,
beyond that, the rule of law simply doesn't allow this
Court in the typical situation to overrule a statutory
interpretation decision in a case like this where
Congress, over the past 25 years, has acquiesced in that
decision.
