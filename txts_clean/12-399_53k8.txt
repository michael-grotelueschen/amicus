CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 12-399, Adoptive
Couple v. Baby Girl.
Ms. Blatt?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
All parties agree that even if the birth
father is a parent under the Indian Child Welfare Act,
the State court decision below awarding custody to the
father must nonetheless be reversed unless Sections
12(d) or (f) create custodial rights that the father
concededly does not have under State law.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you suggesting -- I
don't know that the parties -- I know that the
government has said that (f) doesn't apply to the
father, but (d) does, so there's not a full concession
on your point. But putting that aside, if it is a
father who has visitation rights, and exercising all of
his support obligations, is it your position that --
that because that father's not a custodian, he has no
protections whatsoever under (d) or (e)?
The State can come and take the child away
from an unfit mother or father if they're the ones with
custody, and that responsible parent who only has
visiting rights has no protections under (d), (e), or
(f)?
MS. BLATT: Well, under State law --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not asking about
State law --
MS. BLATT: Right. I think that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I'm asking about
Federal law.
MS. BLATT: Yes, Federal law, which
requires custodial rights, would protect a father who
has visitation, i.e., custodial rights under State law.
So in other words, that -- that is to say,
if a father --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, (d) doesn't talk
about custodial rights. I do agree that (f) talks about
continued --
MS. BLATT: Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- custody.
MS. BLATT: Okay. So let's talk about (d)
because I think we are in agreement that the Respondents
would have to agree that they either need to win under
(d) or (f), and we can talk about Section 1915, but
that's not a basis for father.
But section (d) -- and I'm reading from the
blue brief at 8a says that it requires the party seeking
the termination of parental rights to provide, quote,
"remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed
to prevent the breakup of the Indian family."
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you don't think
that a parent with custody -- well, you do think a
parent with custody is the only definition of family,
but why wouldn't a noncustodial parent with visitation
rights be considered a family with that child?
MS. BLATT: My understanding under State
law, a parent who --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not going to State
law --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could -- could I
hear her answer, please?
MS. BLATT: Yes.
So the answer is, a parent with visitation
rights has custody, so he's protected.
Under State law, if you're paying child
support and you bring a paternity action and sue for
visitation rights, that's a petition for custody. So
all a birth dad needs to do to protect himself is to
acquire legal rights.
This father had no legal rights whatsoever,
parental or custodial, and the word "breakup," even the
other side concedes, it's discontinuance of an existing
legal relationship. There was no legal relationship
between this child and the birth father or his
relatives.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there is a support
obligation on that unwed father.
MS. BLATT: No.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that a
parental right? It's one of the parental rights the
States enforce whether or not you want to provide
support or not.
MS. BLATT: If a child is being adopted, by
definition, the -- the adoptive family would be
providing support. But let's take the -- let's take
what a -- again, the definition of breakup. There is no
familial legal custodial parental relationship that
either this father or the -- or his parents -- his
extended family had with this child.
This adoption no more broke up an Indian
family than his -- than this Hispanic sole custodial
birth mother had raised the child herself.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you do with
the States that do give unwed fathers the -- that don't
support their children and who don't have an ongoing
relationship the right to be considered first for
adoption? Why should we follow the definitions of South
Carolina or those other States? Why shouldn't we just
give it a Federal meaning?
MS. BLATT: Because there's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As --
MS. BLATT: Because there's nothing in this
Act that anyone can point to that was a basis for
transferring custody to this father. At most, there is
an obligation, an exhaustion obligation, that if a
custodial parent has something like a drug abuse problem
the State has to remediate before the family is broken
up.
What is so extraordinary about this case,
particularly the United States' position, is that the
adoptive parents' failure to remediate a dad meant that
the child got custody of the dad. So if this dad had
had a drug problem because there was no treatment of him
the court held, well, that's a basis for giving the dad
custody.
But there's no language in the statute that
even remotely suggests that it's a rights-creating
provision. All of both of (d), (e), and (f) are
protections that assume existing rights and then make it
harder to terminate those rights.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your argument
assumes that the phrase in the statute "to prevent the
breakup of the Indian family" only applies where --
where the father has custody. I don't -- I don't know
why that should be true. If -- if that's what Congress
meant, they could have put it much more narrowly. They
had a very broad phrase, "to prevent the break up of an
Indian family." And this guy is -- is the father of the
child --
MS. BLATT: So he --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and they're taking the
child away from him even though he wants it.
MS. BLATT: Okay. But when you --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that -- that is not the
breakup of -- of an Indian family?
MS. BLATT: The only relationship the dad
had is one of biology. And, Justice Scalia, you cannot
logically break up that biological relationship, nor can
you provide remedial services to prevent the breakup of
that biological relationship.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see. You're
reading -- you're reading "Indian family" to mean
something more than -- than a biological relationship,
right? You're going to hang a lot of -- a lot of other
ornaments on that phrase?
MS. BLATT: Well, I'm hanging -- I'm hanging
a lot on two things.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it seems to me he's
the father, the other woman's the mother, that's the --
that's the Indian family, the father, the mother, and
the kid.
MS. BLATT: He has a biological link that
under State law was equivalent to a sperm donor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: He's the father. He's the
father.
MS. BLATT: And so is a sperm donor under
your definition. He's a biological father and nothing
else in the eyes of State law. And under that view --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This isn't State law. This
is a Federal statute which uses an expansive phrase,
"the breakup of the Indian family."
MS. BLATT: Right. And there is no Indian
family here. The only breakup --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the difference
with a sperm donor? I mean, I know that you raise that
in your brief. But going back to Justice Scalia's
point, if the choice is between a mother, a biological
father, or a stranger, and if the father's fit, why do
you think that the Federal statute requires that it be
given to a stranger rather than to the biological father
when the statute defines "parent" as the biological
father?
MS. BLATT: And assuming all biological
fathers that are acknowledged or established are swept
in, which would include any biological father, the only
stranger in this case was the birth father, who
expressly repudiated all parental rights and had no
custodial rights. So again, the problem the other side
has --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he didn't. I mean,
he -- he said that he was prepared to surrender rights
to the mother, but not to a stranger. And when the
issue of adoption came up, he said, "Yes, I want to
assert my parental rights."
MS. BLATT: It was too late. There's not a
single State law that lets a dad, birth dad, hold that
kind of veto power over a woman.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does it -- where is
there a reference in the definition of "parent" to a
State law? I see the -- which is the section that
defines a parent?
MS. BLATT: Section 1903(9). But even
assuming -- which is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MS. BLATT: -- on page 4A. Whether it's a
Federal definition or a State law definition, I think
everyone agrees you've got to at least look at some sort
of State law. But even if it's just a bare fact of
paternity, meaning a biological link is established,
they still have to have a basis for an extraordinary
award of a transfer of custody when there's been no best
interest determination and you have a dad who's a
complete stranger with no -- no parental rights
whatsoever.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It says a parent means a
biological parent of an Indian child and he fits that
definition. And then the next section -- the next
sentence doesn't have any reference to State law.
MS. BLATT: That's right. And again,
assuming he is a parent -- they -- they need to win both
points, Justice Ginsburg. He needs to be a parent.
Now, if you're an ICWA parent, which means
if you want to accept this definition of "all
biological," you do have rights under the Federal Act of
getting notice and a right to counsel, and the tribe
would have a right to intervene. The question is, is
there a basis for transferring custody under (d) or (f).
(F) is the one that requires continuing custody.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. Blatt, if he's a
parent, why wouldn't some provision in 1912 give him
some rights? In other words, what's the point of making
him a parent under that definitional section if he
doesn't get any of the protections that 1912 provides
for when to terminate rights?
MS. BLATT: Because this -- this Act is not
about creating rights that didn't otherwise exist. It's
about protecting rights and making it harder to
terminate rights that already exist.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But what's the point of
labeling a parent if he gets no parental rights
under the statute and if the termination provisions
don't apply to him?
MS. BLATT: Notice, right to counsel, and
heightened consent requirements. So the mother here,
the birth mother is a parent, so she had a right to
notice, right to counsel, and heightened consent
requirements.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But what is he supposed
to --
MS. BLATT: So those are very significant.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how are they
significant? I mean, I'm trying to understand this
because if you get notice, but then you have nothing to
say in the proceeding because the statute gives you no
rights and the statute doesn't provide any standards for
terminating those rights --
MS. BLATT: Right.
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- what are you supposed to
do once you get notice?
MS. BLATT: Justice Kagan, just because he's
in the door as a parent, that doesn't mean the statute
let him leave out the back door with the child when
there was no, no determination with respect to -- I
mean, any kind -- it would be unprecedented to think
that because you had a failure to remediate to prevent
the breakup of an Indian family, that's a basis for
awarding custody? And that's the United States' view,
which is --
JUSTICE KAGAN: I think you're not answering
the question of what's the point of labeling him a
parent if he gets none of the protections that the Act
provides to a parent?
MS. BLATT: You're assuming that this entire
Act was to make sure unwed dads who are Indian got more
time than non-Indian dads to veto adoptions, and that
had -- that's not even remotely the purpose of this.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, wait, wait, wait.
Isn't your answer 1915(a) still applies?
MS. BLATT: 1915(a) still applies.
JUSTICE BREYER: And so 1915(a) means --
that's right.
MS. BLATT: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: So he does have a -- a
considerable right.
MS. BLATT: Well, 19 --
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, they'll have to go
through a set and decide. They have to give it to him
unless -- unless something overcomes the preference or
there is good cause to the contrary.
MS. BLATT: He's not -- he didn't seek to
adopt the child and he's not one of the preferred
parties.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you're thinking about
this case. I'm thinking in general. I think the
question --
MS. BLATT: Well, no -- no father is a
preferred party under 1915. No father can -- can assert
1915. That is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But doesn't 1915 preclude
the adoptive parents because they're not in the preferred
category? If 1915(a) precludes the adoption, then the
adoptive parents would have no legal basis for objecting
to an award to the father.
MS. BLATT: Right. Well, we have three
responses. First, we -- that provision assumes that
somebody actually in that -- in that statute stepped up
to adopt the child, and no one did here.
Second, it would raise grave constitutional
concerns. I mean, just look at (a)(3) on the other
Indian families if Congress presumptively presumed that
a non-Indian parent was unfit to raise any child with
any amount of Indian blood. And so it would either have
to -- it's either not implicated here or resolved by good
cause. Otherwise, you do have an extraordinary reading,
Justice Ginsburg, of a statute that would override a
birth mother's right to choose the adoptive parents for
her child.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it your position
that the preference is absolute or is it simply a factor
to be considered with the other -- in other words, if
every other factor suggests that the best interests of
the child are served by placement with the adoptive
couple, does the preference under 1915(a) trump all
those other interests?
MS. BLATT: It's not our view. Our view is
you would have -- you absolutely would have had good
cause with -- here when you had the 27 months and also
the mother's choice. The tribe's position is that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not listed under
the -- there are guidelines for what constitutes good
cause.
MS. BLATT: The best interests of the child
is not listed under the government's guidelines, which
again is extraordinary. It's also extraordinary that
any other adopt -- any other Indian would get a
preference whether or not that Indian had the same
tribal member.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in your view, at
what point, at what date did the Indian father lose the
right to ask for custody? Because he changed his mind
in -- in January, there was about a 5-day period there.
MS. BLATT: Yeah.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The adoption proceedings
had not concluded.
MS. BLATT: Right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And at this point he said,
in effect, I've changed my mind.
MS. BLATT: So State law is you have to
support the mother during pregnancy or at birth. So the
cases are pretty clear that the father can't wait till
he learns of the adoption.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the State law
determines when his rights under the Federal Act end?
MS. BLATT: No. State law determines just
when you have parental rights to begin with. So its
there's no question that this particular dad, had State
law applied, the adoption would have gone forward and
his rights would have been terminated by virtue of his
lack of a right to -- to object to the adoption.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless we believe that the
Federal statute determines when he has parental rights
by defining "parent" to include a biological father.
MS. BLATT: Yes, but you still have --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's the case, then
what you said doesn't apply.
MS. BLATT: -- custodial rights, though.
That's not a basis for granting him custodial rights.
This -- again, the -- we can talk about (f), but I think
(f) is pretty obvious that that assumes
preexisting custody to be continued.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I wanted you to talk
about (f). Are you going to say something about that
or --
MS. BLATT: Yes, and I do --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- are you going to leave
it to the government?
MS. BLATT: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't agree with the
government's position, do you?
MS. BLATT: Well, the government agrees with
us on (f). But if you read (d), by the way, it is
inextricably intertwined with (e) and (f). It's talking
about the breakup of a removal proceeding under (f) or a
foster care proceeding under (e), and the government
concedes that neither of those provisions create rights;
they just make it harder to terminate the custodial
rights of a parent who has custody that can be
continued.
The other side doesn't really have a
definition of "custody" or "continue" that would sweep
in a dad without any parental rights. And I do just
want to say in terms of looking, taking one step back.
This is not the case that Congress had in mind when it
passed the Act to halt the depletion of the tribal
population. This involves accretion and conscripting
other people's children to grow the tribal population
based solely on a biological link.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Blatt, continuing on the
assumption that this man is a parent under the statutory
definition, what your argument seems to be suggesting is
that there are really two classes of parents under the
statute, right, that everybody is labeled a parent, but
then there are the parents who get the protections of --
of the termination of rights provision and the parents
who don't.
And I'm just wondering why if this statute
creates two classes of parents it didn't say that in a
more upfront kind of way?
MS. BLATT: Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN: It seems a strange thing to
read into a statute in this sort of backhanded way that
there are really two kinds of parents.
MS. BLATT: Well, I think it's rather
completely upside down that this entire statute, with 20
or 24 references to removal, custody, return of child to
the parent, is somehow being read to create rights.
There is no language in this statute that creates
custodial rights, and the birth father in this case
because of an exhaustion failure under (d), walked off
with the child without any best interest determination.
If I could --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Clement?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT GUARDIAN
AD LITEM IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
But for the application of ICWA, two things
would be crystal clear: The birth father would have
absolutely no parental or custodial rights under State
law or the Constitution; and second, the baby girl would
be entitled to a custodial determination that focused on
her best interests.
Now, the lower courts --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you do with the
lower court's determination that one of the factors of
the best interest calculus was the Federal policy to
ensure that Indian children, children of biological
Indian parents, at least one, should be raised with
their parents? Because the lower court said it thought
it was in the best interest of this child to stay with
its birth father, in light of the Federal policy. So I
disagree with your colleague that there wasn't a best
interest --
MR. CLEMENT: Justice Sotomayor, would that
it were true that the Federal preference was one factor
in a multifactor test that looked at this child in her
best interest. That did not happen here. And if you
have any doubt about that, look at page 40a of the
petition appendix. And what the lower court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do I do with the
lower court's finding that this father, despite not
being married to his prior lover, had children, was
attentive of those children, had the resources to raise
the child? What do we with -- why are you --
MR. CLEMENT: What you do with that, Justice
Sotomayor, is you look what context those findings were
made. Those findings were made in the context of
1912(f), and the court specifically said that for those
purposes all I can look at is the birth father and
whether this new custodial relationship, beyond a
reasonable doubt, would pose a serious harm to the girl.
And what he --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they looked at
something else that everybody's ignoring --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Please finish. Let's
finish.
MR. CLEMENT: What the court specifically
said is they looked at the expert testimony of how it
would cause trauma, despair, anxiety, depression on this
baby girl to be taken from her parents, and the court
specifically said all of that was legally irrelevant
because 1912(f) only lets you look at the harm from the
new custodial relationship. It doesn't let you look at
any harm from the breakup of the previous custodial
relationship.
And all of that would make sense if you were
talking about 912(f)'s application to the situations
it's designed for.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, and even in that
sense, serious emotional and physical damage is a much
different threshold than the best interests of the
child, even on the statutory terms.
MR. CLEMENT: It's miles away. And it's the
appropriate standard when you're taking somebody who has
existing legal custody and depriving them of it. But
everywhere in the law, including ICWA, when you make an
initial placement of a child in a new custodial setting,
you don't do that unless you look at the child's best
interest.
And look at 1916(a) of ICWA, which is the only
provision in the Act that specifically contemplates a
child being placed in a new custodial setting. It talks
about what happens if you have an adoption and then the
adoptive parents for some reason terminate their rights
and then you send the child back to their original
Indian custodian. And in that situation, recognizing
that when there's been a break of custody, you don't
just send somebody off to a -- a new setting based on
beyond a reasonable doubt; you look at the best
interests of the child. And that's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement, can I go
back to that best interest calculus? There's two
timeframes in my mind to look at: In January, when he
asserted his parental rights and 2 years later when the
trial was heard. If there's serious emotional harm, I
think the court below said, we're not looking at what
happens at the time we're deciding the custody issue
because otherwise, we're going to give custody by
estoppel.
We're going to encourage people to hold on
to kids and create the serious physical harm. In
January, when he asserted his rights, that's what we're
looking at. What was in the best interests of the child
at the time the issue was raised, and that was 4 or 5
months after the birth of the child.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I'm
here representing the guardian who represents the best
interest of the child. From the child's perspective,
the child really doesn't care whose fault it was when
they were brought in one custodial situation or another.
They just want a determination that focuses
on at the relevant time, that time, what's in their best
interest. And so in the same way that we think if you
rule in our favor and you remand to the lower court that
there has to be a best interest determination that takes
into account the current situation, notwithstanding that
that would be on the hypothesis that the last 15 months
of custody were based on a legal misunderstanding, we
still think this girl --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So we're going to freeze
it at that point or are we going to freeze it today,
after the child's been with his -- with her father for 2
years?
MR. CLEMENT: You freeze it at the time that
somebody's talking about --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't want to be that
judge, by the way.
MR. CLEMENT: You freeze it at the time that
somebody's talking about changing a custodial situation.
But what is so tragic here is that the lower court
applied 1912(d) and (f), which are clearly designed for
a situation when you're contemplating transferring
custody away from an existing custodial relationship.
They looked at that and applied those inapposite
standards to create a transfer to somebody with new
custody.
Now, the Solicitor --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about now, when you
said the best interest. Now the child has been some
15 months with the father. So if a best interest
calculus is made now, you would have to take into
account uprooting that relationship, would you not?
MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.
We're not here to try to say that anybody is entitled to
automatic custody of this child based on some legal
rule.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- and I take it
you'll say that that goes back to this South Carolina
court if you prevail?
MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely. And I would hope
with instructions to please make that determination as
quickly as humanly possible.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the best interest of
the child is the uniformly accepted standard in State
courts, and if we forget constitutional avoidance
problems which I -- I think exist here, is there
anything in the statute that allows us to import the
best interests of the child into the statutory language,
or do we have to just rely on constitutional avoidance
and -- and really rewrite the statute?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, a couple of things,
Justice Kennedy. If you got to the point of applying
1915(a) and the placement preferences -- and we agree
with Petitioners that they're not squarely applicable
here because the birth father's argument was not that I
get to adopt, but that I have an entitlement -- if you
got to that, I think the good cause standard gives you a
vehicle for importing a lot of best interest standards.
I also think you could look --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though -- even
though the guidelines to what's good cause do not
include best interest.
MR. CLEMENT: That's right, but even the
Justice Department doesn't say that the guidelines are
binding or entitled to anything more than Skidmore
deference, and I'd take constitutional avoidance over
Skidmore deference any day.
But the second thing I would put on the
table is I think the fact that 1916(a) tells you that
the one time you are thinking about transferring
custody, Congress looked to the best interest standard.
That's a clear hint that if you are talking about
transferring custody you should look to the best
interests.
And, again, I think it's imperative to look
at 1912(d), (e), and (f). As the government and the
Solicitor General recognizes, they all contemplate
continued custody, (e) and (f) do.
Now, then the government turns around and
says, well, but (d) was a basis for what the lower court
did, which is to transfer custody. With all due respect
to the government, (d) makes even less sense as a basis
for transferring custody than (f). At least (f) has
some standard designed for some transfer of custody. It
happens to be the wrong transfer. It's the transfer
away from continuing custody out and it's beyond a
reasonable doubt.
But (d) has no standard to satisfy. And
their position is that because this birth father was not
presented with remedial and rehabilitative services,
therefore, because he didn't get remedial services that
presumably he needed, he gets the child. That's crazy.
And what it shows is that 12(d) assumes that
it's like an exhaustion requirement, and unless and
until these services are provided you preserve the
status quo ante. But the lower court didn't preserve
the status quo ante. The lower court ordered this poor
girl sent to somebody who, at least under state law and
just a matter of practicality, is a stranger to her.
And nowhere in the law do you see any child
being transferred to a new custodial arrangement without
a best interest determination. And why did it happen
here? It happened here because of ICWA, which by its
terms does not apply to these situations, and it
happened because of 3/256ths of Cherokee blood.
Now, the Justice Department back in 1978
recognized there were profound constitutional problems
with the statute. Then-Assistant Assistant Attorney
General, later Judge, Patricia Wald, told Congress that
there were applications of the statute that raised equal
protection problems because they treated people
differently solely on the basis of race.
One of the things she pointed to is what she
point -- described as "the (b) portion of the definition
of 'Indian child.'" And that's what makes this child an
Indian child here, its biology, its biology combined
with the fact that the tribe, based on a racial
classification, thinks that somebody with 325 --
1 percent Indian blood is enough to make them a
tribal -- a tribal member, eligible for tribal
membership.
And as a result of that, her whole world
changes and this whole inquiry changes. It goes from an
inquiry focused on her best interests and it changes to
a focus on the birth father and whether or not beyond a
reasonable doubt there is a clear and present danger.
Again, that is --
JUSTICE BREYER: So what do we do about
that?
MR. CLEMENT: You correct the lower court.
And there's two paths to correct the lower court. One
way to correct the lower court is to say, look -- can I
finish the answer?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish the answer.
MR. CLEMENT: You could -- you would either
do it by changing the definition of "parent" and
recognize that, given the consequences that flow from a
parent in the statute, it only makes sense to prove
something more than bare paternity.
Or you could do it by recognizing that if
somebody gets in the front door of this statute based on
bare paternity, you have to interpret provisions like
(d), (e), and (f) with sensitivity to the fact that
under that reading just because you are a parent doesn't
mean you have these kind of extraordinary rights.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Rothfeld?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS BIRTH FATHER, ET AL.
MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
It is simply false to say that this child's
custody was transferred without a best interest
determination, as is apparent from any reading of the
lower court decisions in this case.
Both of the State courts here looked very
closely at the situation here and they found, in their
words, that the father here was a "fit, devoted, and
loving father," and they said expressly and found
expressly as a factual matter that it was in the best
interest of this child.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that's
correct under the Act? Where in the Act does it say
that you need to consider whether or not the father is
a -- would be a good parent? I thought your reading was
that it doesn't matter, all that matters is that he has
in his case 3/128ths Cherokee blood.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think that there
is some confusion as to exactly what the State courts
did here and what ICWA does. ICWA does not assign
custody. ICWA -- ICWA addresses the question whether or
not the parental rights of -- of a parent of an Indian
child can be terminated. The courts here, both courts,
correctly held that under the plain application of ICWA,
under Section 1912(d), as discussed by Justices
Sotomayor and Scalia, clearly parental rights could not
be terminated.
The question then arose, what happens to the
child? And the court then, because there were a natural
parent with intact parental rights, applied the usual
rule that there is a strong presumption that a fit
parent, natural parent, who wants to exercise custody
of -- of his or her child should get custody. That was
what happened here.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And do you -- you want us
to write the case as if this is just a standard best
interest determination and -- and this federal statute
is irrelevant? I don't understand your argument.
MR. ROTHFELD: No, no, Your Honor. I -- I
think that the analysis of the South Carolina Supreme
Court was exactly right in this -- in -- in those terms.
The court applied ICWA, the Federal statute. The
question was, could the parental rights of this parent
be terminated? This -- everyone concedes this is an
Indian child. ICWA applies because of that.
The question then is, can the parental
rights be terminated? Sections 1912(e) and (f) address
that question -- (d), (e), and (f). And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you apply a "best
interest of the child" standard to a termination of
parental rights?
MR. ROTHFELD: No, not in the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, can -- can -- I
know a lot of kids that would be better off with
different parents.
MR. ROTHFELD: And that -- that, too, is
exactly right, Justice Scalia. That is precisely what
the ordinary state law standard says, that there is a
presumption that the natural parent, if the natural
parent is fit, should be awarded custody of the child.
JUSTICE BREYER: Actually, it does -- does
(f) apply, in your opinion, to this case or not?
MR. ROTHFELD: Yes, it -- in our opinion,
both (d) and (f) apply.
JUSTICE BREYER: And (f) has something of
the best interest standard tilted towards the Indian
parent.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right or not? I
mean, as I read it it's something. It's tough, but it's
there.
MR. ROTHFELD: I think that that's right,
but I -- but I would add the -- the caveat that it's not
a best interest in the sense of we are going to apply
this standard to determine custody.
JUSTICE BREYER: So in your view the best
interest standard does not apply, but rather (f)
applies?
MR. ROTHFELD: (F) applies --
JUSTICE BREYER: And (f) is a tough version
of a best interest standard.
Have I got it right or not?
MR. ROTHFELD: Correct, but with this
addition, what it applies for is the question whether or
not the rights of this parent can be terminated.
Whether the parental rights of the parent can be
terminated. And so --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how does (f) apply?
It says "continued custody." That seems to assume that
custody exists.
MR. ROTHFELD: That is -- that is the other
side's argument. Our response is that there is a
definitional provision in ICWA that says that a child
custody proceeding is one that includes a proceeding
leading to the termination of parental rights. Parental
rights are defined to be broadly as the parent-child
relationship.
And so we think in context (f) means that
it's the termination of the parent-child relationship is
what has to be considered.
JUSTICE KAGAN: So your argument is not that
"continued" means something different from the normal
language, your argument is that "custody" means
something different from its normal language.
MR. ROTHFELD: Our argument is that
"custody" means what Congress said "child custody
proceeding" means, which is termination of the
parent-child relationship. And so we think that
continuation of a relationship -- the question is under
(f) would that be harmful for the child? But I should
quickly say that (f) is only one part of the argument
here. As Justices Sotomayor and Scalia began the
discussion with Ms. Blatt, (d) also applies. (D) says
nothing at all about custody. The question under --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could -- could I go
back to what you just said about (f)? You think custody
covers someone who has never had custody of the child
because it refers to something beyond the accepted
definition?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- again, the
definition of "child custody proceeding" in ICWA
includes a proceeding leading to the termination of
parental rights. Parental rights --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But (f) doesn't say
"child custody proceeding." It says "continued custody
of the child."
MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's true, but I
think that has to be interpreted within the context of
the definitional provision and what Congress had in mind
when it referred to child custody proceeding.
But I think -- you know, (f), as I say, is
only a portion of the argument here. And to return to
what Justices --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me why you are
fighting Justice Breyer? He said, I see -- and your --
Mr. Clement said the same thing -- that "good cause"
under 1958 has a variant of best interests of the child
or factors that are considered. I see (f) as doing the
same thing, allotting however a burden of proof that may
or may not be higher than other States.
I mean, in -- in -- some States may have
clear and convincing evidence, some States may have
preponderance. Some States -- I don't know if any have
beyond a reasonable doubt. But it's an allocation of
burden.
MR. ROTHFELD: No. I -- I think that that's
right, and I certainly don't intend to fight
Justice Breyer. I -- I think that --
JUSTICE BREYER: You should if I'm not
right.
(Laughter.)
MR. ROTHFELD: I don't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I think Justice
Breyer is quite wrong because a standard that says
results in serious emotional or physical damage to the
child is far from a best interest standard.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It sure is. And do you
know of any State that -- that applies best interest of
the child standard to termination of parental rights as
opposed to adoption?
MR. ROTHFELD: Absolutely not. And I -- and
I think I -- I will try to agree with both
Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia
and say that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not me, right?
(Laughter.)
MR. ROTHFELD: And Justice Sotomayor. And
always -- always the Chief Justice.
JUSTICE KAGAN: You might just have to
pick --
MR. ROTHFELD: Which gets me to five, so.
But I think -- I think the crucial point is
what -- what we're talking about the determination of
parental rights under -- under (f) is whether or not, as
Justice Scalia says, the rights of a biological parent
can be terminated, which is not sort of the ordinary
best interest determination when you're choosing between
two people who are strangers to the child. So --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is not -- (f)
is not about terminating parental rights. It's about
what -- I mean, it's about custody, right?
MR. ROTHFELD: No, no. I think (f) is
about -- both (d) and (f) are about terminating parental
rights. Parental rights cannot be terminated unless
these determinations have been made. Unless it's been
shown that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In what proceeding,
the adoption proceeding or custody determination?
MR. ROTHFELD: Any proceeding which is aimed
at the termination of parental rights. The adoption
proceeding here cannot go forward, all concede, unless
parental rights are terminated. And so if parental
rights cannot be terminated under either (d) or (f),
this adoption cannot go forward and we are in a
different place.
I think that's what -- exactly what the
South Carolina Supreme Court said. It said, we're going
to apply -- we're going to look to ICWA to see can we
terminate the parental rights of this natural father.
And as Justice Scalia says, that is central. There is a
natural parent here who wants custody. Can his -- can
his claim for custody be denied and can his parental
rights be terminated?
To determine that, Congress has put Federal
standards in place in ICWA, in (d) and (f), and we have
to say both of those have been satisfied here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if you had a
tribe, is there at all a threshold before you can call,
under the statute, a child an "Indian child"? 3/256ths?
And what if the tribe -- what if you had a tribe with a
zero percent blood requirement? They're open for, you
know, people who want to apply, who think culturally
they're a Cherokee or -- or any number of fundamentally
accepted conversions.
MR. ROTHFELD: That --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, is it --
is -- would that child be considered an Indian child, so
a father who had renounced any interest in her until he
found out about the adoption would have all these
rights?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that would be a
different question. What we have here is a --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. That's why
I asked it. It's a different question.
(Laughter.)
MR. ROTHFELD: Well -- and the answer would,
I think, be as a threshold matter, as this Court has
said consistently, it is fundamental -- fundamental
basis of tribal sovereignty that -- that a tribe get to
determine the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the definition
of an Indian child is just straight out of the statute.
An Indian child is someone who is either a member of a
tribe or eligible, and is the biological child of a
member of an Indian tribe.
MR. ROTHFELD: That is correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So return to what is
a hypothetical question and not what the statute
provides. Under your argument, a tribe that did not
require any blood requirement, but simply enrollment,
could be considered an Indian child.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, the -- the child would
have to be a -- would have to be biological parents --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, yes, you have
somebody who has no Indian blood, he enrolls in my
hypothetical tribe, has a biological child. That child
would be an Indian child and the father would be
entitled to the protections you're arguing for.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that's -- that's true
in theory. But of course, A, that is not our case. B,
if that were to occur and whether or not that would be
sort of a legitimate basis for determining membership of
a -- in an Indian tribe I think would be --
JUSTICE BREYER: But that is a problem.
Because, look, I mean, as it appears in this case is he
had three Cherokee ancestors at the time of George
Washington's father. All right? Now, you say, oh,
well, that's a different issue.
But I don't see how to decide that case
without thinking about this issue because if your view
is taken and you accept that definition, a - a woman who
is a rape victim who has never seen the father could,
would, in fact, be at risk under this statute that the
child would be taken and given to the father who has
never seen it and probably just got out of prison, all
right? And you don't know that this beyond reasonable
doubt standard would satisfy that.
Now, that's obviously something I find
disturbing, as a person and also as a judge, because
we're trying to interpret the statute to avoid results
that would be very far out, at least. And -- and that's
what I want you to tell me. How do I prevent that kind
of risk through an interpretation of the statute?
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me answer both that
question and the Chief Justice's question which I think
have similar responses. As to the rape victim, I am
confident that an application of Section 1912(f) would
lead to termination of that father's parental rights,
and so he would never be in the picture as a possible --
well, the question whether or not custody of someone who
has engaged in such conduct could lead to serious
physical or emotional damage to the child, I think there
will be no difficulty in reaching that conclusion.
But on the question of could a tribe
establish some manipulative type of -- of membership
criteria, it's significant that that is not this case
because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Aren't there Federal
definitions of approvals of tribes? Not every group of
native Americans who get together can call themselves a
tribe.
MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is quite right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And isn't one of the
conditions of that a condition of blood and not -- not
of voluntary membership?
MR. ROTHFELD: As I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm quite sure that's
right. So I think the hypothetical is -- is a null set.
I don't think it ever exists.
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I think that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --
MR. ROTHFELD: -- that's what I was trying
to get to -- I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just wondering
is 3/256ths close -- close to zero? I mean, that's --
that's the question in terms to me, that if you have a
definition, is it one drop of blood that triggers all
these extraordinary rights?
MR. ROTHFELD: But it has always been the
Cherokee membership criterion that if someone who can
trace their lineal ancestry to some -- to a person who
is on the Dawes Rolls is a member. No one has ever
questioned that that is a legitimate basis for
establishing tribal citizenship. And so --
JUSTICE ALITO: But what if a tribe makes
eligibility available for anybody who, as a result of a
DNA test, can establish any Indian ancestry, no matter
how slight?
MR. ROTHFELD: I think that that would lead
to the question posed by Justice Scalia. Whether or not
that would be a legitimate basis for establishing --
JUSTICE ALITO: No, it's different from his.
He says it's -- it has to be based on blood. This would
be based on blood.
MR. ROTHFELD: But I -- I think it leads to
his question that there is a Federal element to
recognition of an Indian tribe. And I think whether or
not tribal membership criteria so far depart from the
traditional understanding of what constitutes a tribe as
to be acceptable for those purposes, that would be a
question to be resolved by the United States, by the
political branches.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there are two
forms of the EIFD doctrine, the existing Indian family
doctrine. One applies directly to this case, what's the
status of an unwed father, and they seem, under that
doctrine, to apply the definition that a parent who
hasn't been involved in the care during pregnancy is not
a father.
But the other side of the doctrine is the
one that addresses, I think, the Chief's concern, which
is you don't only have Indian blood, but you've been a
father who's actually been a member of an Indian tribe,
an active member.
We don't have to reach that separate issue
here, that EIFD -- that part of the EIFD doctrine.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I guess I'll give you
two answers to that. First, in this case, there has
been a finding by the family court that this father has
significant ties to the Cherokee Nation. And so if one
could think that that was part of the test under ICWA,
it is certainly satisfied here.
I -- I would go further than that and say
that I think the vast majority of State courts have
correctly rejected that theory because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree.
MR. ROTHFELD: It -- it would be sort of
beyond the judicial competence to determine whether or
not a particular person is Indian enough to qualify for
treatment as a father of an Indian child under -- under
ICWA.
Just to nail this down, as to the particular
membership criteria of the Cherokee Nation, no one has
ever suggested, our opponents here do not suggest that
that is, in any sense, illegitimate or not a traditional
basis for establishing membership in an Indian tribe.
So if one can imagine wild hypotheticals of
the sort that Justice Alito and the Chief Justice have
suggested, they are not present here, and those would
present political questions to be addressed by Congress
or addressed by the executive branch.
In this case, again, the State courts found
that ICWA should be applied to allow a natural father to
raise his child. Those courts found that was in the
best interests of the child to be raised by their
natural parent because that parent was a fit, was a
loving, was a devoted parent in the words of -- of the
lower courts. Those conclusions were quite clearly
correct.
And if I can turn to something which
attracted some attention from Justice Scalia and Justice
Sotomayor in their exchanges with Ms. Blatt, the
application of Section 1912(d) and whether or not the
parental rights of this -- this father, who
unquestionably satisfies the definition of parent in
ICWA, Section 1912(d) says that parental rights cannot
be terminated unless remedial efforts have been made,
rehabilitative efforts have been made to fix a family
that is broken in some respect.
And Ms. Blatt suggests that that does not
apply here because there was no Indian family. I think
what Justice Scalia said was absolutely right. There
unquestionably was a family here in the ordinary sense.
There was a mother, there was a father, there was their
little girl, there were grandparents who very much
wanted to be involved in the life of this child, who
knit socks for her. There's no question --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is my recollection correct
that -- that he had offered to -- to marry the mother,
and she rejected that?
MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is quite
correct. I think that the genesis of this case, they --
they were an engaged couple and the mother broke the
engagement. The father wanted, very much wanted to
marry the mother, wanted to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there's
some ambiguity there because one reason why he wanted to
marry was that he would get more pay and allowances.
MR. ROTHFELD: Well, there -- there are
disputed facts as to what was going on, and so I don't
want to hinge a lot on this. But I think it is quite
clear the father -- they were engaged, the father wanted
to marry the mother.
The father's testimony -- and the family
court found, so we're not talking about simply, you
know, assertions here. The family court found that the
father was excited by the pregnancy, was looking forward
to the birth of the child, that he wanted to marry the
mother so that she would qualify for military health
benefits. The father at the time --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was excited, but
there is no doubt he paid nothing during the pregnancy
and nothing at the time of the birth, right, to support
the child or the mother?
MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is true. But
I -- I am --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he was excited by
it, he just didn't want to take any responsibility.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- that was
after she had rejected his offer to marry her, no?
MR. ROTHFELD: Yes. I mean --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, these -- these
considerations are why domestic relations pose the
hardest problems for judges. Our domestic relations
judges all by themselves every day have these difficult
problems. If we could appoint King Solomon, who was the
first domestic relations judge, as special master, we
could do it. But we can't do it.
MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that -- that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY. But what we have -- what
we have here is a question of a Federal statute which,
as I must understand it, displaces the ordinary best
interest determinations of the State courts. Would you
agree with that?
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I would agree that
Congress indicated that part of the best interest
inquiry for an Indian child concerns -- takes account of
their status as an Indian child, and Congress made a
factual determination -- the fact that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why you make
that concession. I mean, your client has been deprived
of parental rights. I do not know that -- that it is
traditional to decide whether a parent will be deprived
of parental rights by assessing what is in the best
interest of the child.
That seems to me quite --
MR. ROTHFELD: That is quite --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- extraordinary, not
normal.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But is -- is that true
under South Carolina law?
MR. ROTHFELD: Yes, that is. I -- with
respect to that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under South Carolina law
in this adoption proceeding, the -- if it had not been
for the statute, the best interest of the child standard
would not have applied?
MR. ROTHFELD: I think there are three
things that are going on here.
Had ICWA not applied here at all, then the
father would have had no right to object to the
adoption, so the adoption would have gone forward had it
not been for ICWA.
However, as Justice Scalia says correctly,
when a natural parent is involved, and the natural
parent has rights that have not yet been terminated, as
this parent's have not, then ordinarily a best interest
inquiry --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: He would be out under
South Carolina law because he didn't support the child
during the pregnancy.
MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I have to disagree with
that, Justice Ginsburg. The family court judge found
that his parental rights could not be terminated as a
matter of South Carolina law, as well as a matter of
ICWA law. And so we think it is quite clear that this
father's right would not be terminated.
As Justice Scalia says, in the ordinary
course, while we're not engaged in a free-floating best
interest inquiry, one would say whether or not a -- a
profound showing of parental neglect or insufficiency
has been made to terminate those rights. If it cannot,
then that father should get custody.
In response to what Justice Kennedy had
asked about --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Termination of parental
rights requires a showing that it's an unfit parent,
which is quite --
MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is absolutely
right, and no such showing has been made or could be
made in this case.
And if I may just finish --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have an extra --
you have an extra minute.
MR. ROTHFELD: The -- both of the State
courts in this case carefully looked at the -- at the
situation here and found that this father, far from
being an unfit father, was a fit, loving, devoted father
who had created a safe, satisfactory and -- and loving
environment for the child.
Under ordinary South Carolina standards,
once one gets past ICWA, parental rights cannot be
terminated in a situation of this sort, the parental
rights, as Justice Scalia says, of a natural parent, who
had --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if this case would
have come out the same way under purely South Carolina
law, then why are we here?
MR. ROTHFELD: The -- the only reason that
ICWA comes into play is because South Carolina law did
not give this father a right to object to the adoption.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you very much, Your
Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,
FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS BIRTH FATHER, ET AL.
MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I would like to start with the definition of
"parent" under the Act because I think a lot flows from
that. The Act provides that a parent -- a parent of an
Indian child is the -- if it's the biological parent,
except where the child -- or where the parent -- paternity
has not been established or acknowledged.
Here, the -- the father's paternity was
acknowledged and established, both courts below found.
As a consequence, he has not simply a biological
relationship to the child, he has a legal relationship
to the child, created under Federal law.
Then --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but -- did you --
at your -- when you began, do you use "paternity" in the
biological sense?
MR. KNEEDLER: "Paternity" itself is in a
biological sense, but when --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: As -- as you -- as you
interpret the statute, "paternity is the biological
sense," not -- not an --
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- not an existing
parental relationship.
MR. KNEEDLER: No, a biological sense. But
the establishment of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It says that, doesn't it?
A parent is -- is the -- the biological parent.
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. It does.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what it says.
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, but what I'm saying is,
once -- in the unwed father situation, once the father
establishes or acknowledges paternity, the father has a
legal relationship, not just the --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, family law is
traditionally a State province, but your argument is
that Federal law can take a traditional family law term
like "parent" and perhaps others and give it a meaning
that is very different from its traditional meaning or
its meaning under State law?
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, several things about
that.
JUSTICE ALITO: Strike the "traditional"
meaning, but its meaning under State law.
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, several things about
that. First, there are States -- the Casey amicus brief
in footnote 7 identifies a number of States which
recognize parental rights for a parent who has
established or acknowledged citizenship. So the State
law varies on that.
And this was the -- one of the very problems
Congress was concerned about with respect to Indian
children because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. I didn't understand.
Citizenship, who has acknowledged citizenship?
MR. KNEEDLER: I'm sorry. I meant to say
paternity. Sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I understand now.
MR. KNEEDLER: What you have here -- what
you have here are people who are citizens of two
separate sovereigns. An Indian tribe is a sovereign and
a State. Congress tried to accommodate those competing
interests by leaving the cases in State court, letting
them be subject to State law, but subject to minimum
standards to protect the people who are citizens -- or
eligible for citizenship in the Indian tribe.
That is a classic implementation of
Congress's plenary responsibility in the Federal trust
and guardianship for Indians, and nothing could be more
at the core of tribal self-determination and tribal
survival than the determination of tribal membership and
the care about what happens to Indian children.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kneedler, let's say
you're right that this man is a parent under the terms
of the Act, so not just a biological father, but also he
has a legal status as parent under this Act. And then
12 says, well, this is how you go about terminating
parental rights, right?
But then your argument suggests that one of
these clauses applies to him and the other one doesn't,
even though he's a parent. But you're saying he only
gets some of the protections, that there are really two
classes of parents, custodial parents and non.
So where does that come from?
MR. KNEEDLER: I think it's not two classes
of parents. It comes from the text of (f) itself, which
talks about continued custody, which we -- we think
means that (f) applies -- it presupposes that there is
custody to continue. And that's just a condition on the
termination of parental rights.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a very strange way
to put it. I mean, just -- just in passing in the
sentence, that "the continued custody." I mean, you
would think if that's what they meant, they would say,
"where the child" is -- "is within the custody of a
parent, comma, no termination of parental rights may be
ordered, in the absence of a determination," blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.
It doesn't say that. It says, "No
termination may be ordered in absence of a
determination, including testimony of a qualified
expert, that the continued custody of the child by the
parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in
serious emotional."
When it's -- when it's framed that way, I
am -- I am inclined to believe that the "continued
custody" means looks to the future, the continuing
custody by this person in the future. To read into it
the fact that -- that the whole provision only applies
to someone who is then in custody of the child, that's
very strange. That's -- that's not the way somebody
would write a provision like that.
MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I grant you it is
somewhat awkwardly written, but we think the sense of it
is -- is that because this is -- as this Court noted in
the Santosky decision, this is a very unusual statutory
provision with respect to the burden of proof.
And there is some logic for Congress
applying this -- this -- where there is a custodial --
JUSTICE BREYER: But doesn't it happen, in
your interpretation, unlike the two parties who have an
interpretation I can understand, that -- remember my
hypothetical, which I deliberately made dramatic. We
can think of a whole range of things short of that where
the father has seen the mother never, perhaps, or sperm
donors for very short periods of time, and under your
interpretation where there is an ongoing relationship,
even a short one, at least they can't give the child to
the father where it would be very harmful to the -- to
the child.
But under your interpretation, the one
category of people who is exempt from that are the
category of fathers who've never seen the mother.
Who've seen the mother a very short time. Who may be in
-- they're not even subject to looking to see if it's
very harmful to the child.
So I just -- am I right about your
interpretation having that effect? And if it does have
that effect, what's the justification for it?
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- there's
several -- several things about that with respect to the
rapist and the sperm donor. In the 35-year history of
this statute --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you can say,
oh, there's no such thing as a parent, a father who only
sees the mother --
MR. KNEEDLER: No, no, no.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Okay. All
right.
Now, let's suppose there is such a thing.
As long as there is such a thing, the anomaly that I
mentioned seems to me to exist. And am I wrong or right
about that? And if it exists, what's the basis for your
creating an interpretation of the statute that would
produce it?
MR. KNEEDLER: It's -- it's not as anomalous
as you're suggesting because state law standards still
apply, and under state law standard under Santosky,
there has to be clear and convincing evidence to
terminate -- to apply the State termination of parental
rights provisions, which is what the family court did in
this case.
This is -- this is a Federal overlay, an
additional requirement.
If I could, though, move on to --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But as a Federal overlay,
Mr. Kneedler, I mean, does it make sense to sort of
split apart (d) and (f) in this way? Because (d) is the
curing provision that says you have to take steps to try
to cure this parent and, you know, to try to make him or
her a better parent. And then (f) says here's the
standard for terminating parental rights if those
curative efforts have failed. Right?
So to -- to use -- to have the curative
provision but not the standard just seems to -- to make
a -- a mess of the statute.
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, with respect, I don't
think so because custody is in the one and -- and not in
the other. (D) speaks of breakup of -- of the family
relationship. And I think there, the family
relationship because it -- it speaks of termination of
parental rights, which is in turn defined in the Act as
anything that terminates the parent-child relationship,
which -- which can be much broader than -- than whether
the parent actually has custody, which is the word
that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the whole thrust of
it, you -- this is directed to providing remedial
services, which it -- it seems that it fits a situation
where someone has custody but is having problems getting
his or her act together so needs the help of a social
worker, but it makes no sense to talk about remedial
services for someone who has never had custody.
MR. KNEEDLER: Not -- with -- with respect,
Justice Ginsburg, I don't agree. Remedial services here
would entail -- the remedial services have to be tied to
whatever the problem is. And here the problem was the
father had not shown sufficient interest in the child.
Remedial services would have been efforts to interest
the father in the child.
Here that wasn't necessary because as soon
as the father found out about the adoption proceeding,
he acknowledged and established his paternity and said,
I want that child.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he didn't want
anything to do with the child if the mother had kept the
child in her care. It was only when she wanted to put
it up for adoption that he had developed this interest
in the child.
MR. KNEEDLER: And that's -- that is
precisely the point when ICWA kicks in. ICWA does not
try to regulate the relationship between the mother and
the father. That is -- that is left to State law or
tribal law. ICWA kicks in only when there's going to be
an adoption or a termination of rights and the child is
going to be placed outside of -- of the relationship.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what's -- is --
is -- are the would-be adoptive parents required to
provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs
under (d)?
MR. KNEEDLER: No, their burden is to
demonstrate that that has happened. The remedial --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that it's a
tribe -- if the tribe wants to defeat the adoption, all
they have to do is do nothing with respect to the
father's --
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think the -- the
family court could direct that remedial service --
this -- this happens, I think, frequently in family
court, is the remedial services -- this is not an
unusual provision. Much State family law provides for
this. The State court can oversee the -- the remedial
services and that could have been done in this -- in
this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Kneedler.
Ms. Blatt, you have three minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
If you affirm below, you're basically
banning the interracial adoption of abandoned Indian
children. There's not a single adoptive parent in their
right mind who is going to do what the court below said,
which is go through these Kafkaesque hoops of making
sure an absentee father's desire to be a parent has been
stimulated.
This is a private adoption. This is absurd
that an adoptive parent would beg the family court to go
provide parenting classes. And I wanted to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this Act, in
terms of voluntary surrender of Indian children by
parents, says that it's not final for an adoptive parent
until the court does the adoption decree. It gives the
mother the right -- or father -- to rescind the
voluntary adoption till the very last minute. Has that
stopped adopt -- voluntary adoptions?
MS. BLATT: No, but this -- first of all --
I mean, I love that about this case, the irony here. He
had no -- we didn't need his consent under State law, so
the application of 1913, which allowed this withdrawal
of consent, mandates the return of the child.
Well, there was no way to return this child
to anybody other than the mother. And I want you to
keep in mind about this case, is your decision is going
to apply to the next case and to a apartment in New York
City where a tribal member impregnates someone who's
African-American or Jewish or Asian Indian, and in that
view, even though the father is a completely absentee
father, you are rendering these women second-class
citizens with inferior rights to direct their
reproductive rights and their -- who raises their child.
You are relegating adoptive parents to go to
the back of the bus and wait in line if they can adopt.
And you're basically relegating the child, the child to
a piece of property with a sign that says, "Indian, keep
off. Do not disturb."
This case is going to affect any interracial
adoption of children.
JUSTICE SCALIA:
MS. BLATT: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA:
what its intent was?
MS. BLATT: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA:
That was its intent.
You don't think that that's
It only applies to children
of -- to tribal children. And -- and the purpose was to
establish much more difficult standards for the adoption
of -- of a child --
MS. BLATT: No, no, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, maybe you -- you
disagree with that policy, but that's clearly a policy
behind the law.
MS. BLATT: No, I think the policy is
fantastic. It was talking about Indian families who
were being ripped away because of cultural biases and
insensitivity. This case didn't involve cultural
biases.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't say that. It --
its definition of --
MS. BLATT: There's 30,000 pages of
legislative history that's talking about the removal.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That, Ms. Blatt, is what
provoked the Act that Indian children were being removed
from their families, but the Act is written in much
broader terms.
MS. BLATT: I agree. 1915 is extraordinary,
if you read it the way the tribe does, which is -- and
the government does.
And a little bit about the membership
criteria. The tribe's view is any child born Indian is
automatically a member. So even if the parents withdrew
their tribal membership, this child would be covered.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:15 a.m., the case in the
