CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument

Mr. Chan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATHEW K.M. CHAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. CHAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
In 1996, Congress made an important change to
the habeas corpus proceedings by enacting a one-year
statute-of-limitations period. This Court is now asked to
consider, for the first time, how the relation back
doctrine under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(2) is
to be applied in the habeas context.
The Warden advocates a rule for relation back is
that the conduct transaction occurrence set forth in the
initial petition is the core of operative facts to support
the constitutional violations alleged. This rule is far
superior to the Ninth Circuit's rule, which a majority of
Circuits have determined effectively nullifies AEDPA's
one-year statute of limitations.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, I take it the
issue doesn't even arise unless the amendment is accepted
under 15(a).
MR. CHAN: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if there's been lack of
diligence, et cetera, and -- or some prejudice to the
State in the delay of the amendment, the Court just won't
accept the amendment.
MR. CHAN: I should clarify that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or am I wrong about that?
MR. CHAN: -- that in Civil Rule 15(a), the
Court has discretion and grants -- needs to grant leave to
amend after a responsive pleading has been filed.
However, a Petitioner gets to file a responsive pleading
-- excuse me, an amended petition, as a matter of right,
before a responsive pleading is filed.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it was filed before a
responsive pleading --
MR. CHAN: In this case --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- was filed --
MR. CHAN: -- it was Your Honor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: How long does it usually take
to file a responsive pleading?
MR. CHAN: It depends, Your Honor. It varies
with -- case to case. In a lot of pro se --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the State has a certain
amount of flexibility in deciding when to respond, does it
not?
MR. CHAN: Well, Your Honor, the rule does not
require the State to respond to petitions until ordered by
the District Court. And to get back to the question of
Rule 15(a), even after a responsive pleading has been
filed, Rule 15(a) does not serve the same purposes as Rule
(c). The statute of limitations is strict defense,
which is meant to apply whether the filing is a day late
or a year late, whether there is prejudice, or whether
there is dilatory motive. To ameliorate the harsh effects
of the statute of limitations, Rule 15(c)(2) provides an
exception to the statute of limitations, but that
exception is limited to the parameters of Rule 15(c)(2),
itself. So when the Court is provided with a untimely
claim, it determines whether or not that claim is time-
barred, pursuant to 15(c)(2).
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just before we leave
(a), let's assume that we do not accept your position in
this case and there's potential for a gaping hole in
AEDPA. Does the State have some ability to protect itself
by filing a responsive pleading and cutting off the
amendments, or must it do so only if it is ordered by the
Court to file a response?
MR. CHAN: For pro- --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you see what I'm --
MR. CHAN: I do understand, Your Honor. And for
pro se petitions, without counsel, the State is not even
aware of the existence of the petition until it is served
by the Court. And that occurs after the Court has made a
determination as to whether or not a responsive pleading
is required. It can happen that a Petitioner will be able
to amend his petition after the statute of limitations has
already expired, and we would not even know of that until
after everything had been done.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- you have --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, please, go ahead.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I was going to say, if -- on
the scenario that you have raised, in which you don't even
know that the petition has been filed, because the -- you
don't -- the Court hasn't called for a response, the whole
rationale behind the narrow reading is absent, as I
understand it, because you point out that the rationale
for the narrow reading is that the first pleadings put you
on notice as to the case that you have to meet. And you
shouldn't then have to be given an entirely new case to
meet after you've been put on notice and taken whatever
preliminary steps you've taken. But in the scenario that
you're talking about, you have not been put on notice,
because you don't even know there is a petition there yet.
You have not been led to prepare a case which has now
changed. So it seems to me that your rationale does not
apply in the case in which you do not yet have notice,
and, hence, have not filed a response, for that reason.
MR. CHAN: But even in that scenario, we are
still prejudiced by the fact that now we have to address
additional claims that would otherwise be time-barred. We
do not get a chance to --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that -- the problem
with that is that a -- the whole point of a relation-back
rule is to get around a time bar. That's why you have
them. And I thought your argument was, "Well, you
shouldn't allow them to get around this time bar, because
we have been put on notice, we have begun to prepare our
case, and we should not then be presented with an entirely
new case." And so, that's why, it seems to me, your
preparation point, in effect, is trying to limit a rule,
the whole purpose of which is to get around the time bar.
If you don't have the preparation point, you don't have an
argument.
MR. CHAN: Well, I was addressing the situation
in which we -- in which we can answer first. And I think
that I responded, in the reply brief, that that would be
an onerous burden on the State.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, it would be. But, again,
in the case that you're talking about, the very value that
you're arguing for -- i.e., "We ought to be able to rely
on the notice that we have given" -- is an argument which
hasn't arisen yet, because there's no factual basis to
make.
MR. CHAN: Well, that situation would occur not
as frequently as the situation in which we face an
amendment after we have notice, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Chan, there is really no
way for the State entirely to protect itself by -- even by
filing an answer immediately. That would protect it
against the automatic acceptance of an amendment, but it
wouldn't protect it against the District Judge's ability
to grant an amendment after the response.
MR. CHAN: That's right, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There's no way to get any
protection against that, no matter how promptly you
respond.
MR. CHAN: That's absolutely correct. And
Congress could not have intended its statute-of-
limitations rule to be -- to have its effectiveness
dependent upon the Court exercise of discretion under Rule
(a).
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The discretion --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why --
MR. CHAN: Which has liberally granted amendments.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The discretion under 15(a),
at least in the general run of civil proceedings, that is
to be liberally exercised in favor of the pleaders that are
so -- so it's a different -- the 15(c) relation-back test
is quite different from the general attitude to pleading
amendments, "Well, we'll let the Plaintiff," or, here, the
Petitioner, "make the pleading alteration, and then it
will be there, and the Court will make a determination of
whether the pleading is good or not." But, at the 15(a)
threshold, it's not much -- it's not much of a screening
device, is it?
MR. CHAN: No, Your Honor. The better screening
device is in Rule 15(c)(2). As mentioned, Rule 15(c)(2)
is the provision that determines whether or not a claim is
time-barred. And 15(a), then, can determine whether or
not the claim can be amended if it is not time-barred.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Chan, do you think
the Rules of Civil Procedure should be applied in habeas
cases after AEDPA the same way they are in civil -- other
civil litigation?
MR. CHAN: If the Court is referring to Rule
(c)(2), our argument is that Rule 15(c)(2) is not a rule
of automatic relation back, in civil terms, in civil
cases; and, therefore, should not be applied as a rule of
automatic relation back in habeas cases.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But what if we were to
determine that in regular civil litigation it is
relatively automatic? What would your position be with
respect to habeas cases after AEDPA?
MR. CHAN: Well, my argument would be that the
habeas Rule 11 provides that, to the -- to the extent that
the civil rules are not inconsistent with the federal
habeas provisions and rules, that they may be applied. And
I think that Rule 11 compels a reading that if you have
one application that is inconsistent with AEDPA's provisions
and the framework of habeas corpus, and another
interpretation that is not inconsistent, then you must go
with the interpretation that is consistent with AEDPA.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you have more than Rule 11;
you have Section 2244, which says that an application for
habeas corpus, quote, "may be amended as provided in the
rules of procedure applicable to civil actions."
MR. CHAN: And that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So, I don't think it's even a
close question whether the rules of procedure for
amendment in civil actions apply.
MR. CHAN: There's no question that -- we are
not questioning that Rule 15(c)(2) applied to habeas
corpus, but Section 2242 does not give any guidance as to
how 15(c)(2) should be interpreted. And I believe that
guidance comes from Rule 11.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Chan, can I ask you a
question, based on your experience? I'm sure you've had a
lot of experience in this area. This particular claim was
about six months beyond the statute of limitations when he
asked to relate back. It would seem to me that that would
normally be the case, something about that amount of time
would be an issue, because it takes time to process these,
and they had to get counsel appointed. And counsel comes
in and wants to amend the petition, usually, I suppose, in
a pro se petition. Is it -- would I be correct in
assuming that normally in cases of this kind we're talking
about a delay of only a few months?
MR. CHAN: For pro se petitions who have been
assigned counsel, Your Honor?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, no, normally -- the
issue of whether or not there should be -- the petition
may have the benefit of the relation back normally is --
involves a delay of not more than, say, five or six
months, in a normal case.
MR. CHAN: I don't have any statistics on that,
Your Honor. But even if it were only five or six months,
that would --
JUSTICE STEVENS: You still lose the benefit of
the statute. You lose an important right. But I'm just
wondering about how serious a problem it is.
MR. CHAN: It can be a more serious problem in
capital litigation, where you're dealing with many more
claims, which could be more complex, which could require
exhaustion for the -- before the federal review. It just
depends on the nature of the claim and the nature of the
issues involved. I think that the statistics that were
cited in the Justice Department study have different dates
for how long cases pend, depending on the nature of the
claim, whether it be for prosecutorial misconduct,
ineffective assistance, and so forth.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But in the capital case, you've
got a specific provision in there. I mean, for the
capital case, which is the one, I agree, you worry about
most, because there's reason to delay there, Congress
provided specifically for states to opt in; and when they
opt in, they get the benefit of pretty rigorous time bars.
MR. CHAN: That's true, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And so, why -- I mean, isn't
the answer to the capital-case problem exactly the answer
that Congress gave, and, if a state does not want to opt
in, then the normal amendment rules apply?
MR. CHAN: The Chapter 154 provisions do set
forth a fast track for capital cases if the State can
establish certain appointment procedures for counsel.
However, it did not speak to the interpretation of Rule
(c)(2), and Congress could not have intended that the
statute of limitations not apply to Chapter 153 simply
because of Chapter 154.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is your definition of
the test under 15(c)(2)? I mean, on the one side, the
argument is -- Felix's argument is, it's the entire trial
episode, right?
MR. CHAN: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is yours that every
single objection that might be made in this entire trial
record, every one, is a separate transaction or
occurrence, for purposes of 15(c)?
MR. CHAN: For purpose of 15(c)(2), our
interpretation is that the kind of transaction occurrence
is that core of operative facts that support the
constitutional claims. That means that the objections --
it is not necessarily true that one objection claim would
not relate back to a second objection claim. It just
depends upon whether they're closely related.
In this case, the claims are not closely
related. You have a claim made of confrontation -- excuse
me -- confrontation clause, by the admission of Williams'
videotaped evidence; and then you have the admission of
evidence of a coerced confession statement. However, it
takes an entirely different set of facts to establish that
new claim.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The successive petition rules,
or the rules prohibiting successive petition, seem to
treat the entire attack as one -- as one legal theory, as
one case. And it seems to me to be in -- somewhat
intentioned for that, for you to break it down the way you
want to under Rule 15(c).
MR. CHAN: I think that the Respondent made a
similar argument, based on a res judicata claim, and it
was noted in the treatises that were cited that you have
different intents behind res judicata and the relation-
back doctrine, and they just do not apply that way.
I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Chan.
Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT
FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
The relevant conduct, transaction or occurrence
in the habeas context is the set of facts that are
asserted in support of the particular grounds for relief
under habeas Rule 2. That reference point best preserves
Congress' intent under AEDPA to accelerate the filing and
disposition of habeas proceedings.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you, Ms. Blatt, taking
the position that that is a tighter test than would apply
ordinarily to the mine run of civil cases under 15(c)?
MS. BLATT: I think, Justice Ginsburg, our
fundamental point is, there is no counterpart to tort or
contract action, with habeas. There is just no analog.
And that is because there's not only Rule 2, which imposes
this heightened across-the-board fact pleading
requirement, but it's also because those pleading rules
work in tandem with all the other unique habeas rules that
apply only to habeas that serve to narrow the timing and
scope of habeas review.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a -- it's a little odd
for the statute to say that the rules apply; and then we
look to the rules, but we interpret it differently. I
certainly see the common sense of your position, but I'm
just having a problem with 15(c)(2).
MS. BLATT: Yes, I just don't think it's
different, both -- regardless, you've got to come the case
and figure out what is the relevant-conduct transaction or
occurrence in a habeas petition. And there's the extreme
view of viewing it as the entire trial or conviction, or
there's another view as -- look at it as what the habeas
rules require, and that is the prisoner to identify a
particular unconstitutional conduct or occurrence that
gives rise to a basis for relief.
Now, under the Ninth Circuit's view, a prisoner
can timely file one claim and then add any number of
completely different claims after the one-year period.
For instance, a timely Batson challenge could then --
after the one year, the claim could add claims of
ineffective assistance of counsel, Brady violations, or
coerced confession. And to have to resolve those claims
would significantly extend the limitations period beyond
the one-year period.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, this case isn't as
extreme as that, is it? It has to do with evidence
admitted at trial.
MS. BLATT: It's -- well, that's true, it takes
in trial errors, but that's a lot. Ineffective assistance
of counsel is a trial error. Coerced confession,
confrontation clause, discriminatory selection in the jury
-- I mean, I don't know if that's a trial, or maybe
pretrial -- but it does take in a lot, and I don't think
there's a close call that they relate to different actors,
different time periods --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, certainly in the civil-
case context, generally, the interpretation has been
pretty broad. And I suspect if we try to narrow it a lot,
we're going to have a lot of litigation about this point.
MS. BLATT: I'm not sure about that. This has
been the rule in the majority of Circuits for five or six
years now, since 1999 or 2000, and it hasn't generated a
lot of problems. And that's because, Justice O'Connor --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Can you articulate the rule
that you want? Be as precise as you can, if you would.
MS. BLATT: It would be the set of facts that
are asserted in support of the grounds for relief in the
original habeas petition. And the reason why this hasn't
generated a problem, Justice O'Connor, is that -- in the
way the Courts of Appeals haven't really had to identify a
test -- is because they're so disparate in time and type.
You have an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim that's
timely raised, and then there's discriminatory selection
of the jury.
JUSTICE SOUTER: How about a case --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I sue for negligence or, in
any civil action we might -- we might imagine, there might
be three or four ways in which the Defendant has injured
me, and the Tiller case, the railroad case, tells us that
it's a single action. And do you concede this, that
you're asking us to interpret this differently and more
narrowly than in the civil context?
MS. BLATT: I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do you concede that?
MS. BLATT: I concede that -- it's hard to
answer that, Justice Kennedy, because a habeas proceeding
is not a train accident. And there is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's hard for me to
figure it out, too, but it seems to me that what you're
saying is that we have a different rule, because this is
habeas.
MS. BLATT: In the civil context, you always
have a question of, Do we let in other loan transactions
in a breach of contract, or, Do we let in another pattern
or practice or -- of similar products? I mean, there's
line-drawing, when it comes up in the civil context, all
the time, every day in District Courts. But, Justice
Kennedy, in habeas there are more than ordinary principles
of finality at stake that aren't -- that just aren't true
in any tort or contract action. And this Court said that
in the Calderon decision. And the reason is because of
the interest in not just the prosecutor in having adequate
notice --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So to complete Justice
O'Connor's -- the answer to Justice O'Connor's question,
you say, "And we interpret this differently in habeas than
in other cases, because of finality concerns."
MS. BLATT: I would be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to interpret it
differently.
MS. BLATT: That would be totally acceptable,
because of the distinct interest in not only the finality
in the interest of society, and repose --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm sure it would be
acceptable, but what's the authority for interpreting the
rule two different ways, depending on the case?
MS. BLATT: Well, it's not like there's a habeas
civil proceeding that we're asking for a habeas -- habeas
proceeding to be different. There is no counterpart to a
tort action or a contract action where it's liberal
pleading requirements under Rule 8, and every single
grounds for relief in a habeas proceeding there is a
requirement that the prisoner actually identify all the
grounds and the particular facts in support of that, and
those heightened pleading requirements focus the
proceeding on that particular transaction.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me -- let me ask you
how that would work in this case. The original claim is
that there was a Fourth Amendment violation in admitting,
you know, unlawfully seized evidence. Later, the
Petitioner wants to amend to claim ineffective assistance
of counsel, because counsel totally overlooked the leading
case, directly on point, on this particular evidence. Is
that arising out of the same operative set of facts, or is
-- or is that something different? Clearly, the facts are
not exactly the same. Close enough?
MS. BLATT: Well, we'd look to the common core.
And I think we would argue that one is focusing on
counsel's performance, and the other is on police
misconduct. But, Justice Souter --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but if that's -- if
that's the line you're going to draw, then it seems to me
that, in effect, what you are saying is, you can't amend.
Because I can't imagine an operative set of facts that are
going to be much close than -- in the real world, than the
-- than the two sets that I gave you; and if they're not
close enough, you're really arguing for a no-amendment
rule.
MS. BLATT: There's amendment all the time in
the majority of Circuits that have applied the
Government's test, and it comes up in two scenarios --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Not if you were the judge.
MS. BLATT: No, that's not true, Justice Souter.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but, I mean, why --
MS. BLATT: Because --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- why --
MS. BLATT: Let me just say, on the attorney-
ineffectiveness one, it's completely besides the point
what the Government's view is, because the claims are
completely derivative, and the prisoner gets no benefit
whether he gets the amendment or not, because, in order to
show procedural default, he's going to have to show
attorney effectiveness, and he just doesn't get anything
additional, one way or the other, and it really doesn't
matter which claim he asserts first.
But the reason why amendment occurs all the time
is because our rule allows the prisoner to amplify facts
such that if he raises a Miranda claim or a Strickland
claim, and doesn't allege custody or doesn't allege
prejudice under Strickland, he can amend, after the one-
year period. And also --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So you can amend -- you can
amend your factual basis, as it were, but you can't amend
your claims.
MS. BLATT: No, the way you get claims, which is
really the -- the direct text on the rule says you can add
a claim if it arises out of the same -- is if the
transaction relates to the -- to give you an example, to
an involuntary confession, you could have an amendment of
a Miranda claim that arises out of that police -- alleged
police misconduct that culminated in the admission of the
confession. You could also have a Massiah violation that
--
related back to a Fifth Amendment claim. And you could
have other types, too.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that the reason
for the -- for defining the relation back the way the rule
does is interest in fairness to the Defendant you don't
want to let him be surprised; whereas, your claim, as I
understand, is really based entirely on the interest in
finality and repose.
MS. BLATT: Well, I think the interest of notice
is part of it. I mean, it doesn't always trigger when the
State hasn't -- or the Federal Government hasn't answered.
But statute of limitations are not only about fairness, in
terms of preserving evidence, but the interest in repose
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the definition --
MS. BLATT: -- and closure.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in the rule is really to
protect the interest in fairness, because interest in
repose is always the same.
MS. BLATT: Well, that -- it's to preserve the
statute of limitations, but if the relevant transaction is
something narrower than the conviction, then the interest
of repose sets in. And, I mean, the other side has, you
know, the same point -- it's if you draw it out broad
enough --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the interest in repose
is always there. You'd always like to preserve the
defense, whenever you can. That's really what's at stake
here.
MS. BLATT: Well, I think what's at stake is
Congress' intent in passing the one year. And it's
fundamentally inconsistent with that to have a prisoner
timely file one claim and then potentially add an
unlimited number of claims, no matter how different and --
in time and type --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if they all come in just
two or three months after the statute's run.
MS. BLATT: Well --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It's really not a big deal.
MS. BLATT: -- a six-month difference is a 50-
percent extension of the limitations period, which is a
big deal. And Congress wanted a --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And here, it was five months.
MS. BLATT: I think it was five months.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here.
MS. BLATT: It was five months. And --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you relying, Ms. Blatt,
at all on the difference between the pleading rules for
civil cases, generally, and habeas, where you do have a
whole set of pleading rules, separate the habeas
rules?
MS. BLATT: May I answer? I think we're relying
on both habeas Rule 2 and the principles under AEDPA on
finality.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.
Mr. Porter, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. PORTER
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. PORTER: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
I'd like to respond to the finality concern,
because I think that really goes to the heart of this
case.
Three weeks ago, this Court, in Rhines versus
Weber, unanimously approved of the stay-and-abeyance
procedure, because the Petitioner's interest in obtaining
review of his federal claims outweighed the competing
interests of finality and speedy resolution of the federal
petition.
Now, Mr. Felix's case is even more compelling
than Rhines, because, unlike the stay-and-abeyance
procedure, which is just the power -- the inherent power
of the Court to control its docket, here we're talking
about the command of Congress.
In Section 2242, of the judicial code, Congress
provided, specifically, that the rules governing
amendments of habeas petitions be controlled by the rules
governing civil procedure. The only rule regarding --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's true. I mean,
we can accept that, but we still have to interpret what's
a transaction or occurrence, I assume. And is it open to
us, in the habeas context, to take a narrow view of that?
MR. PORTER: Your Honor, I believe that under
this Court's decisions about how you determine what
Congress did, Congress operated against a backdrop of how
Rule 15(c) was applied by this Court and the lower courts.
And in 1948, when 2242 was adopted, Tiller was very
recent; it was a 1945 case. It must have been -- and we
assume that Congress, like normal citizens, know what the
law is, and they developed the rule against that backdrop.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that was -- that was a
rule for tort cases; it wasn't a rule for habeas cases.
And, as pointed out by the Government, habeas cases are
fundamentally different, in that the notice that you give
to the opposing party in tort cases, ordinary civil cases,
is very vague. It's just, you know, what the event was,
"I got hit by a train." You don't have to say, "Wherein,
the train was negligent -- or the railroad was negligent,"
or anything else; just, "I got hit by a train." Whereas,
with respect to habeas corpus, there are rules that
require specifying all the grounds for relief available to
the Petitioner, state the facts supporting each ground.
It seems to me that those different pleading requirements
suggest that what is the relevant transaction or
occurrence for the one is not the same as what is the
relevant transaction or occurrence for the other.
MR. PORTER: That's a very good point I'd like
to address, because I don't think we hit that -- upon that
in our briefs.
Habeas 2 -- habeas Rule 2 does require fact
pleading, but the purpose of that is not to give notice to
the other party, as the Solicitor General and the Warden
suggest. The petition is not served on the Warden in
habeas cases, so they don't even get a copy of the
petition; it is filed with the court.
The purpose of the fact-pleading requirement of
Rule 2 is so that the District Court, under Rule 4 of
habeas rules, can perform its screening function to
determine whether the petition is facially valid or not.
That requires some sort of facts to be plead. And that's
in the Advisory Committee notes. It's also the
requirement of 2243 of the Judicial Code, that the
District Court review the petition so that wardens are not
disturbed with every pro se litigant's Petitioner and have
to respond.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Whatever the reason
for it is, certainly you can interpret the rules to say
that the pleading requirement being different and much
more specific, the amendment process should be different.
MR. PORTER: I think that that's -- Congress
reasonably could have said that, and reasonably could have
said that -- amended 2242, for example, when it passed the
Antiterrorism Act, and said, "Generally, yes, the rules of
civil procedure apply for amendments," but we're -- there
should be a narrower rule.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But you don't need an
amendment, I don't think. If you're talking about a
transaction, the question is, What is the transaction?
And in habeas it may be quite different than in other
civil things.
MR. PORTER: I think that the only basis for
determining what "transaction" is, you have to look at the
-- if you -- if you're right, that we should have some
kind of different rule for habeas than all other civil
proceedings, well, then it has to be grounded in the
habeas statutes. And if -- when you look at the habeas
statutes, it says, "Confinement must be in violation of
the constitutional" --
JUSTICE BREYER: But then --
MR. PORTER: -- "laws which" --
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what's bothering me
about this case is, I don't know that the Government needs
to argue that there is a different rule. As I read the
lower-court decisions, what they've done is used the words
"core operative fact." Core operative facts in a tort
case, where the engine of Train A runs into the caboose of
Train B, is that collision. And the decision that the
front -- the locomotive should have been lit, as well as
the back of the caboose, seems, arguably at least, the
same operative fact. Core operative facts. But to say
that a witness, in the middle of the trial, was treated
unconstitutionally seems, at least arguably, quite a
different set of core operative facts from the fact that
the Defendant was questioned before the trial.
Now, that seems to me related to the nature of
habeas, but it still seems to me that those words, "core
operative fact," the same words, work differently in the
two situations. And to adopt your approach also strikes
me as running around the one-year statute of limitations.
Now, those are my concerns, and I would
appreciate your addressing them.
MR. PORTER: Well, I hope I can put those to
rest.
On the first concern, I think that there are
differences between a train wreck and habeas. Most of my
habeas cases are train wrecks, so I hope that's not -- but
I think there is a logical difference between them. But I
think when you look carefully at the case of Tiller, those
really were very different facts about the head car not
being lit and the rear of the locomotive not being lit.
After all, those were two separate legal claims, as well.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Porter --
MR. PORTER: The first one --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- all that would be required
to allege, to take the four-line complaint -- all that the
Plaintiff would have to say in that tort case is, "The
train was negligently operated," with nothing more
specific than that. And then the particulars could come
out later. Under habeas, you can't do that. You must set
out your grounds, and the -- Rule 2 is very specific about
that. So, it's a very different approach to what you have
to allege, going in.
MR. PORTER: I agree, Your Honor, but you -- I
think you need to step back and look at the purpose for
the difference in the pleading rules. The purpose is, if
the -- if the reason was that you have to give specific
facts to put the other side on notice, I would say that
there is a compelling argument that that should be -- that
should inform this Court's decision about how Rule 15(c)
should be read. But it's very clear, from 2243 and from
habeas Rule 4, that the purpose for requiring the facts
underlying the claims is not to give notice to the other
side, but to allow the District Court to perform its
screening function to determine whether the -- whether the
petition is facially valid or not. If it's not valid,
then the Warden is not even served with the petition. It
just -- the petition is simply dismissed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you file -- can you file a
request for a more specific statement in habeas, as you
can in a civil case?
MR. PORTER: Yes, under Rule 81 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, and Rule 11, unless application
of that rule is contrary to, or inconsistent with, the
habeas statutes or rules, then it is applied.
JUSTICE BREYER: Could we go back? Because I'm
still concerned with the fact that Claim 1, which is a
claim on January 2 that police arrested the Defendant and
didn't read him Miranda warnings properly; Claim 2 is a
claim that, two and a half years later, the prosecutor,
during the trial, made some prejudicial arguments. Now, I
think, just common sense, Do those arise out of the same
core operative facts? Absolutely not. The facts are
totally different. The only thing that brings them
together is that there was a single legal proceeding.
And, at the same time, if I adopt this approach
--
that doesn't seem to comport with the common sense, I'm
running around Congress' effort with the one-year statute.
So what is your response?
MR. PORTER: First of all, the response is that
the statute -- the rule does not use the term "core
operative facts."
JUSTICE BREYER: No, but every lower court that
has -- not every one; you know better than I -- but it
seems like a commonly found expression when lower courts
have interpreted the Rule 15 and have looked to Tiller.
Is that true, or not true?
MR. PORTER: Not in the habeas context. None of
those --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, of course not in the habeas
context. I'm saying that if we're trying to apply, in the
habeas context, the same test that's used elsewhere in the
civil law, wouldn't we use the word "core operative fact"?
Or would we? I'm not as familiar with this as you. What
is the answer?
MR. PORTER: I don't believe so. I think that
JUSTICE BREYER: No?
MR. PORTER: -- and Wright and Miller confirmed
this, that actually courts have tried to develop different
tests: Is it the same evidence that they're going to use?
Is it a core of operative facts? And, in the end, they
say there's no better test than the one set forth in the
rule, and that is conduct, transaction, or occurrence.
JUSTICE BREYER: But, of course, we're trying to
decide what is the transaction.
MR. PORTER: Right, but the reason why is that
there is a body of case law that determines -- that's told
us what that means.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's --
MR. PORTER: And Tiller tells us it means that
it's the events leading up to the injury. And so, that's
how, I think, that that phrase has been interpreted, and
that's what Congress adopted --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's take --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What about -- what
about the case law in the lower courts that Justice Breyer
referred to, dealing with the core operative facts and
adopting --
MR. PORTER: Mr. Chief Justice, I think -- they
don't -- I'm not aware of those cases using --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: -- you say let's look
at all the cases that have followed Tiller, and -- but
apparently a lot of the courts adopting the core operative
fact have developed that without full regard to Tiller.
MR. PORTER: No, the lower courts -- the most
usual interpretation of Tiller that we've cited in our
brief that the lower courts perform is this idea of any
events leading up to the ultimate injury --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But in the habeas context,
haven't the majority of the Circuits had a more
restrictive rule than the Seventh Circuit and the Ninth
have espoused?
MR. PORTER: Yes, they have.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. And so, I think the
question is, Should we follow the majority of the
Circuits?
MR. PORTER: And you should not, because what
those courts fail to do is, they fail to appreciate
that Congress has already spoken, in two different ways.
First, Congress adopted 2242; and when it adopted AEDPA,
it did not amend 2242, and it did not amend Rule 15(c).
And, second, in death-penalty cases, which, after all, is
really the only set of cases where there is an incentive
to delay, Congress specifically spoke. And in
66(b)(3)(B) Congress said, "Amendments to petitions
shall not be permitted after answers are filed unless the
Petitioner can make a showing for a second or successive
petition."
Now, this is Lindh versus Murphy all over again.
This is a case where Congress has spoken as to Chapter
4. In Lindh versus Murphy, it said, "That chapter will
be -- the amendment will be applied retroactively to cases
then pending." They did not do anything with Chapter 153
cases. The negative implication, when Congress so
specifically addresses this issue for one limited, narrow
set of cases -- and that really make sense in death-
penalty cases, does it not? When the State gives the
death-penalty Petitioner lawyers for State post-conviction
review, then all of those claims are done in state habeas,
they are brought together, it fulfills the claim-gathering
function of the Antiterrorism Act; and then, very
logically, Congress determined, "We should have a very,
very strict restriction of amendments."
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me -- let me ask you.
Take the two events in this case, and as explained by
Justice Breyer, a Miranda violation in the questioning and
then a problem with the confrontation clause in the trial,
two years later. Let's assume that there was a 1983 civil
action for those violations, and let's assume that both
are actionable. Different cause of action. Is that --
how would -- how would an amendment be treated in a civil
action? Based on most of the lower-court precedents
you've been-- would the amendment related back?
MR. PORTER: I don't believe so. In civil-
rights actions, there are -- the constitutional rights at
issue are the injury. So one -- if a person started out
with saying their injury in the civil-rights action was
the admission of the evidence --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You would think no relation
back, in the case I put --
MR. PORTER: Because there -- it does not relate
to the same injury. In habeas, by contrast, the injury is
the custody that's in violation of the Constitution laws
and treaties --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The injury --
MR. PORTER: -- of the United States.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- I suppose, in the -- in the
Miranda violation, is introducing the evidence at the time
of trial.
MR. PORTER: That's correct.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's the point. You don't
look two and a half years back just to -- you decide what
happened at the trial.
MR. PORTER: That's correct. And in this --
JUSTICE BREYER: Right. So what about the
injury? What about that? That the injury -- the trial's
over, say, six weeks -- the injury takes place at the time
of introduction? Or is the injury the whole time the --
the guilty verdict?
MR. PORTER: Well, that the that's the problem
with the -- with the Warden's proposed test. Are these,
quote, "closely related claims"? That is not, I suggest,
a -- nearly a bright-line rule that would help the
District Courts in determining what is, and what is not,
part of the same transaction. So, I don't think that
that's a real viable alternative.
I -- again, I think it's important for the Court
to go back -- if it's going to create a different rule in
habeas, it has to have some grounding --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why doesn't the 1981 --
given -- maybe I don't -- haven't followed it correctly,
but why doesn't the 1981 claim, then, relate back? I
think the injury that took place from both violations took
place at the time of trial.
MR. PORTER: Well, maybe I wasn't following the
hypothetical closely enough.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I --
MR. PORTER: If --
JUSTICE BREYER: Forget it.
MR. PORTER: Okay. Well, let -- if we can
return to the facts of this case, I think these -- we fit
comfortably within the definition of "transaction,"
because both of the rights that Mr. Felix is asserting in
this habeas petition are trial rights. Under this Court's
decision in Chavez versus Martinez, in this Court's
decision in Pennsylvania versus Ritchie, both the Fifth
Amendment and the Sixth Amendment rights are trial rights.
Those statements, independently, when they were taken by
the same police officer, did not violate any rights. They
only violated Mr. Felix's rights when they were introduced
in the -- in the prosecution's case in chief.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But the argument as to
whether it was properly done, whether the ruling was
proper, is going to go back to the time of the Miranda
interrogation.
MR. PORTER: I agree that those facts are
relevant, but it's the operative facts that are --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, why isn't that
an operative fact?
MR. PORTER: Well, it is -- the operative fact
-- what makes it actionable is that the statements were
introduced at trial.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes, but --
MR. PORTER: If those statements weren't
introduced at trial --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, you've switched.
We were talking about "operative fact," and now you said
"actionable fact."
MR. PORTER: I believe those are the same
principles, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Porter, if I understand
you right, you are saying that, in the habeas context, the
counterpart to an injury in a tort case is the unlawful
detention, itself. Am --
MR. PORTER: That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I right?
MR. PORTER: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. So if that's the
injury, could the habeas Petitioner come in with a
complaint that says, "I am being detained in violation of
the Constitution," period, "and I need a lawyer to spell
out the details"?
MR. PORTER: The Petitioner could file such a
petition. They have been called "placeholder petitions."
But, clearly, under Rule 4 of the habeas rules, such a
petition would be subject to immediate dismissal by the
District Court, because it doesn't conform with habeas
Rule 2, which requires that all of the claims be alleged
and all of the facts be alleged.
JUSTICE BREYER: What about the other part of
what's been bothering me? To be specific about it, it
sounds like a very good system. The system is, "Habeas
Petitioner, you file, within a year, your petition with
one claim, and we'll look it over," says the judge, "and
if it sounds like you need a lawyer, we'll give you a
lawyer, and then he'll come in with a whole lot more."
And that's quite protective.
But suppose you said that to Congress. They
passed this thing. And you say, "You know, your year
here, it doesn't really mean a year. It means a year for
this initial filing, and then what's going to happen is,
they'll give him a lawyer, and he'll come back and say the
interest of justice, but, really, it always, almost
always, favors the Petitioner, and the State isn't that
fooled, and, really, it's not a problem for them, and" --
what would that Congress have said? That's -- that is
very much disturbing me.
MR. PORTER: I think the answer to that is that
statutes of limitations are ubiquitous in civil
proceedings. But just as ubiquitous is Rule 15(c)
relation back. They go hand in glove. And Congress, in
48, just three years after the Tiller case, when it
enacts 2242, must have had on its mind that relation back
goes along hand in glove with the statutes of limitation;
and, not only that, but how relation back has been
construed by the courts.
So I don't think it's any surprise to Congress
now all of you -- now all of a sudden that we say, "Oh,
you know, by the way, there's this relation back that's
going to give us maybe four or five months longer than the
year." I don't think Congress is at all surprised by
that. And Congress just adopted new rules of habeas
proceedings, in 2004; didn't amend Rule 15(c), didn't
provide another rule in habeas, didn't amend 2242.
And, as far as the potentials for abuse here,
the Seventh Circuit's -- Judge Easterbrook's decision for
the Seventh Circuit in the Ellzey case has been on the --
on the books for more than two years now. And I would
suggest that if the parade of horribles that the Warden
has suggested, about year-long delays and all of these
potential abuses, in fact, are allowed by the rule that we
seek here, that the Warden or the United States would have
come to this Court and said, "Look, here are the abuses.
They are happening right now." Well, in fact, Ellzey's
been cited twice in all -- in these years, by the District
Court, to allow relation back. Mr. Felix's case has not
been cited at all in a published case. So, I think that
the parade of horribles is theoretical and not practical.
As Justice Kennedy pointed out, you have Rule
(a) as a backstop. And once the answer is filed, that
really cuts off any right to file an amendment as a matter
of right. Then --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I think that, first of
all, the amendment may be made before there is a defensive
plea. As Mr. Chan pointed out, that the Warden doesn't even
get the petition until it's been screened by the Court.
The other is the understanding, on the civil side, of Rule
(a). It's a very liberal pleading rule. The threshold
for granting permission to amend a pleading under 15(a) is
very easy to pass.
MR. PORTER: In Foman versus Davis, this Court
responded to that concern and said that District Courts
have ample authority under 15(a) to deny amendments to
petitions -- or amendments to initial pleadings. It said,
for bad-faith or dilatory tactics, but then said even
undue delay -- so you don't even require a showing of bad
faith -- for prejudice to the other side.
So all of the concerns that the Warden has
raised are specifically identified by this Court to give
the District Court the right to deny an amendment to the
petition. And so, I believe that those powers in the
District Court are very ample, indeed.
Plus, we have -- the states have their own
ability to protect themselves. As one of Your Honors
mentioned, we have 2266. If the -- if the states opt in,
they get the protections of 2266. States have their own
mechanisms. All but six states in the Union have statutes
of limitations, or very firm laches doctrines, that will
prevent the elongated delays that the Warden is worried
about in this case.
And as far as the notice provision, Justice
Breyer announced the unanimous opinion for the Court this
morning, in Durachem, and said, "It doesn't take much to
give the defendant fair notice."
Now, I'd like to leave the Court with the
judicial aphorism that wisdom often never comes at all; it
should not be rejected merely for coming late. We ask
this Court to affirm the decision of the Circuit Court.
If there are no more questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Porter.
Mr. Chan, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATHEW K.M. CHAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. CHAN: Mr. Felix assumes that Congress knew
about the Tiller case, and assumed that Congress would
know that Tiller would be interpreted in a way as to allow
relation back in a situation such as this. However, as
pointed out, Tiller is not a habeas case. Rule 15(c)(2)
did not even have any application to habeas cases at the
time, until it was decided.
Also, I wanted to respond to Justice Souter's
earlier question about examples of relation back in habeas
corpus cases. And I've cited two examples on page 27 of
the Warden's brief.
Unless there's any other questions, I have no
more rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Chan.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:57 a.m., the case in the
