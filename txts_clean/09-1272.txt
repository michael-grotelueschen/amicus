CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Mr. Farley.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA D. FARLEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FARLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The issue before you today, of whether or
not police can impermissibly create exigent
circumstances, arises from the improper suppression of
reasonably seized evidence after a reasonable
warrantless entry. The test set forth by the Kentucky
Supreme Court is improper for several reasons, the first
of which is that this Court has routinely held that the
subjective intent of police officers when effecting a
warrantless entry is irrelevant.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the -- where
did the Kentucky Supreme Court -- where did the Kentucky
Supreme Court say that it was looking to a subjective
state of mind on the part of the police?
MR. FARLEY: Well, the Kentucky Supreme
Court's first prong of their test -- and I believe it's
in our petition appendix on page 26 -- I'm sorry.
Their -- their discussion starts on page 44a and carries
over to 46a. The first question of their test is
whether or not the officers acted in bad faith in an
attempt to purposefully evade the warrant requirements.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That didn't -- that
didn't apply in this case?
MR. FARLEY: That is correct.
The second prong of the Kentucky Supreme
Court's test is whether or not the actions of the
Respondent in this case or the occupant of the home
would have been foreseeable by the police officers
before they knocked and announced their presence.
Now, the problem with the foreseeability
test --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why is -- why is that
subjective? Why isn't that -- would it be foreseeable
to a reasonable police officer similarly situated?
MR. FARLEY: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it --
it isn't directly a subjective inquiry. However, police
officers are trained to expect and foresee illegal
activity so that they may carry out the duties of their
job in protecting the citizens. So under a
foreseeability test, a reasonable officer will always
foresee illegal activity in response to his actions, be
it walking down the street or knocking on your door. A
reasonable officer will always foresee illegal activity,
and for that reason, the Kentucky Supreme Court's test
is completely unworkable.
Several of the other circuits and the lower
courts have adopted tests that also attempt to add an
extra exception, an unwarranted closure of the exigent
circumstances exception that narrows the use of that
exception by police officers. The test that the
Commonwealth would propose is a simple lawfulness test.
Now, under this test, as long as an officer
behaves lawfully, there should be no suppression of
evidence seized after an otherwise reasonable search.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you have an
apartment building where the police know from experience
there's a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug
transactions. Every 2 weeks, they walk through and
knock on every door and wait for evidence of the
destruction of -- of drugs. Is that all right?
MR. FARLEY: Well, there's -- I would say
"yes," if there's probable cause as well as exigent
circumstances.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the probable
cause, of course, comes when they hear the, you know,
flushing and the, you know, hiding or whatever behind
the door.
MR. FARLEY: Well, I would assert that there
are -- there are two separate issues here. You must
have probable cause separate from the existence of
exigent circumstances. In this case, there was probable
cause due to the smell of marijuana.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They go to the apartment
building, and they sniff at every door, and when they
sniff, when a strong smell of marijuana emanates from
the door, then they go through this routine, but they do
it as a matter of every 2 weeks, as the Chief said, as a
routine matter. They don't just knock on every door,
but they knock on the doors where they smell marijuana,
and they do that just as a routine, in all the buildings
where they suspect there may be drug -- drugs being
stashed.
MR. FARLEY: Justice Ginsburg, under a
simple lawfulness test, since the officers have not
violated the Fourth Amendment prior to the exigency
arising, there would be no need to suppress any
evidence. That would be perfectly fine for the officers
to do that. It may not be the most --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to the Chief Justice
when he said -- and I think this was the Solicitor
General's position -- that the police can routinely
knock at a door and wait to see if they hear a toilet
flushing. I -- I've taken it out of this case but --
because I don't know what noise means. But your answer
would be "yes"?
MR. FARLEY: Yes, if -- if probable cause
exists, because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, why -- why do you
need the probable cause inquiry? What does it have to
do with anything?
MR. FARLEY: Well, under the Fourth
Amendment, for a reasonable warrantless search to occur,
a police officer must have --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Before they can go in --
MR. FARLEY: Yes. The police officer must
have --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because they've just
heard the toilet flushing?
MR. FARLEY: They must have probable cause
coupled with exigent circumstances.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I think
I've got two different probable causes that's caused --
causing me some confusion. I understand their
requirement of probable cause, and that they hear sound
of evidence being destroyed and therefore enter. Is
that -- or are you talking about the probable cause to
think there's something going on in the first place?
MR. FARLEY: There are two separate issues
here. They must have probable cause aside from exigent
circumstances. Then they must also have --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: To knock on the door?
MR. FARLEY: -- a reasonable belief --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: They must have probable
cause to knock on the door?
MR. FARLEY: No, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. All right.
MR. FARLEY: They can -- just as citizen
could --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Take us --
MR. FARLEY: -- they could knock on the
door. However --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Take us through it -- take
us through it chronologically. The policeman is walking
through the hallway. He has no probable cause. He --
he --
MR. FARLEY: He could knock on the door.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: He smells marijuana --
MR. FARLEY: The smell of --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- then he knocks on the
door. When did the probable cause arise and when must
it arise?
MR. FARLEY: Well, the smell of marijuana
would give probable cause to obtain a search warrant.
Once he knocks on the door and hears noises consistent
with the destruction of physical evidence, then an
exigency has arised. Now the officer has both probable
cause and an exigent circumstance. And under the --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But I don't understand why
the smell of marijuana is necessary. This goes back to
what Justice Sotomayor was saying, you don't need
probable cause to knock on a door. Knocking on a door
is perfectly lawful. So, if there's just a lawfulness
test, the knock is fine. And then when you hear
whatever it is that you hear that you think creates
exigent circumstances, whether it's a toilet flushing or
whether it's just noise, that, too, gives you the
ability to go right in.
So -- so if it's just lawfulness, you don't
need the marijuana smell even, do you?
MR. FARLEY: Well, I think -- I think we're
confused. In order to enter with exigent circumstances,
you must also have separate probable cause, and it's
that you could have gotten --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Probable cause beyond
thinking that the evidence --
MR. FARLEY: Beyond the reasonable belief --
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- is being destroyed?
MR. FARLEY: Yes. Correct.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay.
MR. FARLEY: That is correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It might just be somebody
going to the toilet, right?
(Laughter.)
MR. FARLEY: It could be. It could be. It
could very well be.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you have to suspect
that the reason the toilet is flushing is somebody is
trying to get rid of evidence. And in order for that to
be the case, you have to have smelled the marijuana?
MR. FARLEY: Yes, Justice Scalia, you're
absolutely correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there's only one
probable cause, right?
MR. FARLEY: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.
MR. FARLEY: Yes. The exigent circumstances
is a reasonable belief based upon the totality of the
surrounding circumstances. Here, given that the
officers had a reasonable belief that they were chasing
a fleeing felon, they had a reasonable belief that this
was the doorway he had entered, then you couple that
with the noises that they heard, they testified were
based on their training --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May --
MR. FARLEY: -- and experience --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May we just go back
over -- you're putting in the fleeing felon, but as far
as I understand from this record, it was never shown
that the dealer that the police were following was aware
that he was following and that he was fleeing from them.
This is the -- it's not part of the question you
presented, because we granted only on the exigent
circumstances, but I didn't think that there was -- the
dealer wasn't called, and he wasn't asked did you even
know that the police were following you?
MR. FARLEY: That -- that's correct, Justice
Ginsburg. However -- and we cannot divorce the
officers' chase of this suspect, regardless of whether
he knew of their hot pursuit or not, we cannot divorce
those facts from what the officers knew when they
knocked on the door.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, you can.
There's nothing illegal about walking down the hall and
knocking on somebody's door. And if as a police officer
you say I smell marijuana, and then you hear the
flushing, then there's probable cause. You don't need
any business about the dealer and the breezeway and all
that at all.
MR. FARLEY: Certainly. Certainly, Mr.
Chief Justice. You're absolutely correct. I was -- I
was just speaking in terms of this case, saying that
there were -- there was ample evidence that exigent
circumstances existed here, coupled with the probable
cause.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask a question --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And in your view --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask a question that
goes back to what you said? You have clarified very
nicely that there has to be probable cause to think that
there's something wrong going on in the -- the
apartment. And you said that is, at that point when
they -- the marijuana -- a strong smell comes from the
door, at that point the police could go and get a
warrant. Then they don't have to, because then they
knock on the door.
We start out with a strong presumption that
the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, a strong
preference for getting the warrant. So why in this
situation wouldn't the first response of the police
be -- instead of knocking, because once they knock they
alert the people in there: Let's get a warrant; we'll
come back.
MR. FARLEY: Well, the officers testified
under these circumstances that they believed that they
were in hot pursuit of this felon. So at the time they
were at the door, they believed he had entered this
apartment and was aware of their presence and was
destroying evidence of his deal of crack cocaine, so
this is a fluid, evolving --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, how does this
-- how does this holding by us not become a simple
warrantless entry in any drug case? Meaning: Police
knock on the door, suspect doesn't answer it, gets up
and moves to their bedroom. Because there's no noise
that was described by this police officer. It was
simply not answering the door and moving. So if that's
all it takes, any police officer will come in and say:
In my experience, most drug dealers destroy the evidence
when we knock.
MR. FARLEY: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Aren't we just doing
away with Johnson? And aren't we just simply saying
they can just walk in whenever they smell marijuana,
whenever they think there's drugs on the other side?
Why do we even bother giving them a -- a warrant?
MR. FARLEY: Well, I would disagree with
you. I think that when determining whether an exigent
circumstance exists, you look at the totality of the
circumstances. So -- and there would be a myriad of
cases in which a court would determine that, simply
based upon the testimony or the noises that were heard,
with no surrounding circumstances, that exigent
circumstances may not have existed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if the
defendants here had not flushed the evidence down but
had answered the door and said "Yes?"?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: Would the policemen have
been able to do anything just because they had smelled
marijuana?
MR. FARLEY: They could have sought a
consensual encounter with the occupant.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, but they'd say:
Oh, heck, no, you can't come in --
MR. FARLEY: Well, then --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- do you have a warrant?
MR. FARLEY: Then the officers would not
have been able to force entry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So basically the -- the
police were taking advantage of the stupidity of the
criminals; is that right?
MR. FARLEY: Well, I don't know about --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's terrible. That's
not fair, is it?
MR. FARLEY: I don't know that I would
phrase it -- there is no -- there is not a requirement
to inform an occupant of a right to denial. However,
the officers could not have forced their way into the
home. That would have made this a case like Johnson.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if the officers had
simply knocked, said "We're going to kick the door in if
you don't open it"?
MR. FARLEY: I believe that's still fine
under a lawfulness test, unless the occupant of the home
submits to that show of authority and comes to the door
and allows entry. Now, if that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, after -- after
they've heard the -- the movement inside or the flushing
or whatever. You can't just kick it in because you've
smelled marijuana. You -- can you do it, because you --
you knock on the door because you smell marijuana,
nobody answers, and you kick the door in?
MR. FARLEY: Well, I believe that the noises
that they heard were consistent with destruction of
physical evidence based upon their training and
experience.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but without that
noise. Just --
MR. FARLEY: Then, no. No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, of course not.
MR. FARLEY: No, of course not. They would
have to obtain a warrant at that point. If the person
came to the door and denied them consent, they would
have to obtain a warrant. If the person did not come to
the door and made -- no exigency arose, then the
officers would still have to go and obtain a warrant --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- this may be a bit
rudimentary, but can you tell me why isn't the evidence
always being destroyed when the marijuana is being
smoked? Isn't it being burnt up?
(Laughter.)
MR. FARLEY: I -- Justice Kennedy, I -- I
would tend to -- I would tend to agree with you.
However, I know this Court in Johnson stated that the
smell of burning opium was not the destruction of
evidence, and the only thing they could have obtained
would have been the fumes or the vapors. I tend to
agree -- disagree with that personally. However, from a
legal viewpoint, the simple smell of burning marijuana
is not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the distinction is
being destroyed as opposed to being consumed?
MR. FARLEY: Correct, that is -- that is
correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how is it -- you
mention Johnson.
MR. FARLEY: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I think the other
side says it was the same thing except it was a hotel
room instead of an apartment building. The police
smell -- in that case, it was -- what was it?
MR. FARLEY: Well, what occurred in Johnson,
I believe, is -- is completely different than what
occurred here. What occurred in Johnson was the
officers forced their way into the occupant's apartment
-- the occupant's hotel room and then said: Consider
yourself under arrest.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't they smell
marijuana or opium or something?
MR. FARLEY: Well, they did, and they
knocked on the door, and she came to the door and
they -- they forced their way in. There was no -- there
was no "let us in," there was no demand for entry, there
was no even ask-for consent to enter. They then said:
Consider yourself under arrest. They searched, and then
held her under arrest based upon the evidence that they
obtained.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You left out one thing.
I thought they heard ruffling noises before they
attempted to get into the apartment -- into the hotel
room. There was something about noises.
MR. FARLEY: Well, I believe they heard
sounds when they knocked on the door. But she actually
came to the door, and then the officers forced entry.
Here we don't have that. We have no forced entry.
These are two different circumstances. In Johnson, an
exigency did not exist. Here an exigency does exist.
If there are no further questions, I'd like
to reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Farley.
MR. FARLEY: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. O'Connell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. O'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
If police officers act lawfully in
conducting their investigation, they may respond to any
exigencies that arise. It is up to police officers to
determine how they will collect evidence in any given
case as long as they stay within the confines of the
Fourth Amendment. Although securing a warrant --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- does a
ruling in this case that any lawful conduct by the
police mean that the police knock, somebody gets up on
the other side and walks through a closed door, and
closes a door in the back, and police say, "In my
experience it's -- it's consistent with the destruction
of property that drug dealers will go into a closed room
to get rid of it" -- is that enough?
MS. O'CONNELL: I don't think so, Justice
Sotomayor. I think that in any case --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why not? I mean
people -- you know, when there's a knock on -- on the
door, is the normal human reaction to walk into the
other room and shut the door?
MS. O'CONNELL: Well, a person might not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's peculiar
behavior, isn't it?
MS. O'CONNELL: A person doesn't have to
answer the door. A person might come to the door; they
might also ignore whoever is at the door. Both of those
options are fine.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a common
experience, that you knock on a door and all you hear is
somebody walking out of the room and shutting a door?
MS. O'CONNELL: I mean, I -- I guess that a
person is entitled to do that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't recall it ever
happening to me, but maybe -- maybe I'm a likable fellow
and people open the door.
(Laughter.)
MS. O'CONNELL: I mean, I think that that --
that's certainly a lawful option that somebody has when
the police officers knock at their door. And,
certainly, in this case --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They could say "Go away."
They could do a lot of stuff. But walk in the other
room and shut the door?
MS. O'CONNELL: That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Strange.
MS. O'CONNELL: I guess some people might do
that if they don't want to give consent to police entry.
I think that in order to go in, based on an exigent
circumstance, the police would have to be able to
articulate to a court that they objectively, reasonably
believed that there was destruction of evidence
occurring inside.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what was that here?
Because it was kind of vague. They heard movement.
What kind -- what kind of movement? It didn't -- it
said nothing about a toilet flushing --
MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, it's our
position that the Court should assume that there was an
exigency in this case.
In the Respondent's brief in opposition, he
argued that there was insufficient evidence of exigency.
The Court nonetheless granted cert on the question of
whether a police-created exigency would be okay under
the Fourth Amendment. The Solicitor General believes
that the Court should assume there was an exigency, and
if it agrees with Kentucky on the question presented and
then reverses, it should remand to the Kentucky Supreme
Court for a determination of whether an exigency
existed.
The trial court in this case certainly found
that the movement inside of the apartment was enough for
the officer to reasonably conclude that somebody inside
was destroying evidence. The Kentucky Supreme Court
assumed that that was so in order to reach the question
presented in this case that the Court granted cert on.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. O'Connell, if I could
ask you about the government's proposed standard: You
say that as long as each step in the police conduct is
lawful, that's sufficient. And each step would -- the
way the Fourth Amendment works, each step -- we're
asking, essentially, whether each step is reasonable.
What some courts have done, in addition to
that -- and this was not the approach of the court
below -- but what some courts have done is to say we
also ask a more holistic reasonableness question. We
say: Is the whole process by which the police operated
with respect to this person reasonable? So, for
example, we might say, you know, was there time to get a
warrant, or did it look like the police were just --
they preferred not to have to deal with a magistrate?
So what's wrong with that sort of standard?
In addition to asking whether each step is reasonable,
to say, look, is the whole pattern here of what the
police did to come up with this evidence reasonable?
MS. O'CONNELL: I think the problem with
that test, Justice Kagan, is that police officers have
options of how they can conduct searches and seizures.
Getting a warrant is one way that they could do that.
Getting consent to conduct a search or a seizure is
another way. There's no justification in this Court's
precedents for requiring police officers to choose one
of those options over another if both options are
lawful.
In this case, the police officers knocked on
the door, not sure which apartment the person that they
were pursuing fled into, in order to determine whether
that was the correct apartment. There's no reason why
they needed to get a warrant before knocking on the door
and seeking cooperation of the people inside.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it your position that
the police can do anything that's lawful, even if the
purpose of doing so is to create exigent circumstances?
MS. O'CONNELL: Yes, I think that under this
Court -- the way that this Court has interpreted Fourth
Amendment warrant exceptions, as long as there is no
violation of the Fourth Amendment, that is okay. The
police officers can rely on any ensuing exigency.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the question
presented in the blue brief used the word
"impermissible," and we're talking about "unlawful." I
take it that there is a difference in those -- or no
difference?
MS. O'CONNELL: Well, yes, there is a
difference. I think that that comes up in Respondent's
argument that if there was an impermissible demand for
entry -- for example, if the police officer said "I have
a warrant, let me in," even though he didn't, as in
Bumper v. North Carolina -- that that could still be
okay under a lawfulness test as long as the suspect
reacted by destroying evidence instead of by coming to
the door, like in Bumper or Johnson, and going about
with a --
JUSTICE BREYER: What are the objections to
adding in the alternative "or in bad faith"?
MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, the
objection to that is simply that in all cases that are
founded upon probable cause that are not programmatic
searches that are conducted without any individualized
suspicion, this Court has repeatedly rejected prongs of
a Fourth Amendment test that -- that rely on the
subjective assessment --
JUSTICE BREYER: Objectively? I mean, what
we're trying to rule out is they -- they hitch -- they
get this bright idea, the police: We'll go knock at
every door. You know. So what about that, objectively
determined bad faith?
MS. O'CONNELL: I'm sorry. I don't --
JUSTICE BREYER: My point is a solely
unlawfulness test would allow the police to get into the
habit of just knocking at every door, but if you say
that also it has to survive a bad-faith test, where bad
faith is objectively, not subjectively, determined, then
you will rule out the possibility of the police
hatching -- which I don't know if they would, but
hatching such a plan.
MS. O'CONNELL: I guess that it's not
totally clear what bad faith would mean in this
context --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there are circuits
who have adopted a bad-faith test in the alternative
with other things than the word "unlawful." The Second
Circuit uses only the word "unlawful," and I thought we
took this case to iron out that discrepancy. And if we
did, I'd like to know your objection to ironing it out
by taking the Second Circuit test but adding on an
objectively determined bad-faith rule.
MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, I don't -- I
don't know what it means to act in bad faith in a case
like this as a police officer.
JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe it could mean having
no reason for knocking on the door other than to create
exigent circumstances.
MS. O'CONNELL: Well, Justice Alito, I think
that it would be difficult to determine objectively
whether that was the case. Certainly --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the police say: Oh,
I don't want to get a warrant. It's such a bore. We
have other things to do. I have a great idea; let's
knock at the door, and then as soon as he starts moving
around, I know what his going to the -- going into the
bathroom means, and we'll hear that, and we'll be able
to get in.
MS. O'CONNELL: I think that --
JUSTICE BREYER: Hey, great idea.
Okay? Now suppose that's the record.
MS. O'CONNELL: I think that there's already
a significant risk built into the Fourth Amendment that
police officers, if they knock on the door and they
don't hear somebody destroying evidence inside, they're
going to have to leave and get a warrant. I think
that's enough of a deterrent.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know that they're
destroying evidence unless you have reason to believe
that there is contraband inside. I mean, the -- the
hypothetical is an unrealistic one. They knock on the
door, and somebody moves inside -- that doesn't give
them any exigency --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I mean to add:
And, in fact, there's probable cause.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. They --
JUSTICE BREYER: In addition, he smelled the
marijuana. I just was trying to stick to the relevant
points.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a different
hypothetical.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. All right. Add that
to the hypothetical.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There's a hypothetical in
which they knock on every door under which they smell
marijuana.
JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. That's what I
mean, and I don't always spell it out.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Perfectly okay?
MS. O'CONNELL: Right, and I think that
there's -- the Court shouldn't be concerned, and
certainly shouldn't be concerned enough to adopt a
bad-faith or a subjective motivation prong to a test
that it creates which is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what makes that
different than knocking on the door and saying "Open the
door or I'm going to kick it in"? You're saying that's
lawful because until the person submits, you're
suggesting there's no coercion in that whatsoever.
MS. O'CONNELL: That's true, and, Justice
Sotomayor, to be clear --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why wouldn't that
objectively be bad faith if what we find out is that
they now have a tactic which is they go through this
building, and every time they smell marijuana, hash, or
-- I don't know if crack cocaine smells or not when
they're smoking it -- but whenever they smell something,
they just do that.
MS. O'CONNELL: I think the -- the fact that
if the person actually does what the police officer says
and answers the door will mean that the evidence would
be excluded as a coerced consent search is enough of a
deterrent to that sort of conduct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there's no bad-faith
measure whatsoever in your analysis --
MS. O'CONNELL: I don't think it's
necessary.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and lawfulness is
defined by actual physical seizure. So if we have cases
that suggest something else, a command to submit, your
argument would be lost, correct?
MS. O'CONNELL: I think that's right, if the
person submits to the command.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Ms. O'Connell.
Ms. Drake.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMESA J. DRAKE
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. DRAKE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The odor of burnt marijuana, coupled with
Officer Cobb's cursory and equivocal testimony about the
sounds of movement he couldn't discern exactly and that
his training and experience led him only possibly to
conclude was consistent with the destruction of
evidence, is insufficient to establish exigent
circumstances.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Although you're --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're describing
what you think the evidence was to support exigency, and
the suggestion we've heard on the other side is that
that's an issue that can be addressed on remand once we,
according to the other side, correct the State court's
error in that this -- you -- the police cannot create
exigent circumstances.
So I -- I don't know that it's terribly
relevant what the underlying facts about what they heard
was. That will be relevant depending, or not --
depending on what our opinion says.
MS. DRAKE: It's relevant because it goes to
whether exigent circumstances existed. And as to the
question of whether a remand would be appropriate in
this case, the question of whether exigent circumstances
existed is logically antecedent in any created exigency
case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's -- it's not
at all. The court said: I don't care whether exigent
circumstances existed; you cannot create exigent
circumstances; so I don't care whether they were or not.
The legal standard is antecedent to the
application of the facts.
MS. DRAKE: There's no point in delving into
whether an exigency was created by the police if there
is no exigency to begin with.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I think the
Court is interested in taking the case on the question
whether or not the police may create exigent
circumstances and use those exigent circumstances to
enter. Now, whether or not there were exigent
circumstances here because of the sound is -- is, it
seems to me, a subsidiary question.
MS. DRAKE: The other problem with remanding
this case for further determination on this issue is, as
this Court is aware, the procedural posture of this case
is troubling. The case has already been dismissed.
There is no potential for further proceedings here.
There is no --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, sure, there is.
It was dismissed because the State supreme court held
you can't bring this evidence in. If we say, oh, yes,
you can, then the issue becomes live again.
MS. DRAKE: That conclusion is dependent on
the notion that an indictment is merged with the
judgment such that a decision in the Commonwealth's
favor in this case would vacate the decision of the
Kentucky Supreme Court, which in turn vacates the
underlying suppression order. But there is no authority
for the notion that an indictment and a judgment merge
as a matter of Kentucky law, and so a decision --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is the argument
you presented to us in the letter, right?
MS. DRAKE: Yes, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And yet, we
nonetheless decided to have argument.
MS. DRAKE: Yes, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So maybe it would
be -- it's your case, but maybe it would be best to move
on to the legal issue.
MS. DRAKE: If we move to the question of
whether the police have created exigent circumstances,
it's important that we're all operating on the same
understanding, the facts in this case. This case does
not involve a simple knock at the door, and -- and the
distinction is important. In this case, at 9:50 p.m.,
the officers banged on the door as loudly as they could.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did the trial court make
those findings? I know that you said it in your brief,
and I thought I read the trial court record. I know
they knocked loudly.
MS. DRAKE: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what else did they
MS. DRAKE: Yes. And this is located at the
appendix to the petition in the bottom of page 3a
carrying on to 4a. The trial court found: Detective
Maynard, who was accompanying Officer Cobb in the
breezeway attempting to locate and arrest the suspect in
question, banged on the door of the apartment on the
back left of the breezeway, identifying themselves as
police officers and demanding that the door be opened by
persons inside.
Officer Cobb testified at the suppression
hearing -- and this is at page 22 of the joint appendix:
Detective Maynard made contact with the door, announced
our presence, banged on the door as loud as we could,
announced "Police, police, police."
This is not the case where --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where's -- no "Open
up." I thought you said earlier they said "Open up."
MS. DRAKE: Yes. Then Officer Cobb later
goes on to explain -- and this is on page 24 of the
joint appendix: Detective Maynard with Sergeant
Simmons, we explained to them -- referring to the
occupants of the apartment -- we were going to make
entry inside the apartment.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that after --
after the exigent circumstances or the alleged exigent
circumstances were presented? And that's after they
heard what they thought -- and I know you disagree --
was the destruction of evidence.
MS. DRAKE: It's -- it's unclear from the
trial court's factual finding what the order of events
was. The trial court found: Banged on the door of the
apartment, identified themselves as police officers,
and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Loudly. Is any of that
unlawful? Is -- is knocking loudly on the door
unlawful?
MS. DRAKE: It's unreasonable conduct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it unlawful?
Is -- is saying "Open up, police" -- is that unlawful?
MS. DRAKE: Well, it's certainly not
unlawful in the sense that it violates any provision of
the penal code. But this is a Fourth Amendment case, so
the question is whether it's reasonable.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Drake, the problem I
have is there are a lot of constraints on -- on law
enforcement, and the one thing that -- that it has going
for it is that criminals are stupid.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: And we had a case some
years ago in which the issue was whether the Washington
police could enter buses arriving from -- from the south
and -- and randomly ask passengers, do you mind if we
look in your luggage? And the -- the -- the mules who
were carrying marijuana were stupid enough to say, oh,
of course. Just to show that they had nothing to fear.
And an enormous number of arrests were -- were effected
in that fashion.
We didn't say that's not fair because you're
taking advantage of the -- of the ignorance of these --
these poor criminals. We said that's perfectly okay.
And it seems to me the same thing is going on here.
These people could have answered the door --
there's a policeman knocking on the door; all he's
saying is "Open the door, open the door" -- and say
"Yes, what do you want?" Say -- you know, blah, blah,
blah. They say "Well, get a warrant." Shut the door.
They didn't do that. But everything done
was perfectly lawful. It's unfair to the criminal? Is
that -- is that the problem? I really don't understand
the problem.
MS. DRAKE: I have two responses to Your
Honor's question. The first is that -- and along with
this notion that criminals are stupid and so that's why
we get all these criminal cases, there is no difference
between what happened in this case and how an innocent
person would respond.
Recall Officer Cobb's testimony is simply
that, after banging, he heard movement. Any innocent
person at 10:00 at night would have to move in order --
JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this? It
might -- it might make a difference to me whether the
police demanded entry prior to the time when the alleged
exigent circumstances arose. And the only testimony on
this point that I am aware of is on pages 22 and 23 of
the appendix, when police banged on the door as loud as
they could and announced "Police, police, police," and
then Detective Maynard banged on the door and said "This
is the police."
Now, is there any -- anything more in the
record? Any evidence that they -- prior to the time
when they heard what they allegedly heard, that they
said "Open the door"?
MS. DRAKE: The portion of the Joint
Appendix that I quoted to the Court -- we explained to
them we were going to make entry -- appears on page 24.
JUSTICE ALITO: Right.
MS. DRAKE: So, if Your Honor keeps
reading --
JUSTICE ALITO: It starts -- it says: We
knew that there was possibly something that was going to
be destroyed inside the apartment. At that point
Detective Maynard -- this is after they heard the
sounds, after they claim to have heard the sounds.
MS. DRAKE: Yes. Officer Cobb's testimony
suggests that the demand came after they heard the sound
of movement. The finding by the trial court, however,
is that this was all happening simultaneously and in
very quick fashion.
JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any -- is there any
evidence of that? Did anybody else testify to what
happened?
MS. DRAKE: No, Your Honor. Officer Cobb's
testimony was -- was all the Commonwealth offered.
But the chronology of the demand is not
dispositive in this case because the demand itself is
not dispositive. The demand removes any doubt that the
officers were not seeking a consensual encounter, but
you still have the behavior of banging on the door.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, does it -- does it
turn on how loudly they knocked? If they just knock on
the door and say "This is the police," is -- is that --
is there anything wrong with that?
MS. DRAKE: It -- it depends entirely on
whether a reasonable person would interpret that
behavior as the officer conveying the impression that
entry was imminent and inevitable. And this feeds back
to Justice Scalia's question, which is, well, what --
what is unreasonable about what the officers did here?
JUSTICE ALITO: What was there here to make
a reasonable person believe that -- that entry was
imminent and inevitable, if -- if all that's done is a
knock on the door and they say "Police, police, police,
this is the police"? Maybe it turns on how loudly they
spoke or how loudly they -- they knocked; is that the
point?
MS. DRAKE: That is the point. Those are
all relevant criteria because, in every Fourth Amendment
case, we're considering the totality of the
circumstances.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that
you're trying to change the case. I mean, this is not a
case where they come in and, in effect, demand entry.
My understanding is that the issue in the case is
whether or not, after a request for entry, they can then
base probable cause in dispensing with the warrant based
on what they hear from behind the door.
Now, I know you think that they -- whatever
they hear is perfectly innocent; but the issue is
whenever they knock on the door, "Police" or "Can we
come in" or whatever, and then they hear that, the
activity behind the door, they have reason and can --
can enter.
Now, what you're -- it seems to me what
you're arguing is, well, they did something else. They
banged on the door, they yelled "Police"; it wasn't
simply knocking on the door and seeking entry. And you
may be right, again, on the facts, but it seems to me
that's for -- for later on.
I want to know what your position is on
whether they can assume, at least for me, they knock and
say "Can we come in" or knock and say "Police" -- no
demand to get in.
MS. DRAKE: If I understand Your Honor's
question, the officers are engaging in what we would
call a true "knock and talk." They're seeking --
they're on -- the scenario is such that no one would
doubt they're attempting a consensual encounter.
Our position is because that behavior is
reasonable, it is not made unreasonable by the fact that
evidence may be destroyed, and so suppression would not
be the remedy. Well, then, here --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you agree
that -- that the court below is wrong because what they
say, as I read it, is irrespective of how reasonably the
police behave, if it is reasonably foreseeable that
their tactic will create exigent circumstances -- and I
would think it's reasonably foreseeable, when you knock
on the door very politely and say "The police," that
somebody might shout out "Hide the pot"; all right?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: That if that's reasonable
foreseeable, says the court, then that violates the
Fourth Amendment. But we have the Second Circuit that
says as long as the police behaved unlawfully, it --
lawfully, lawfully -- it does not violate the Fourth
Amendment; and we have the First Circuit that has some
kind of bad-faith test plus an unreasonable or improper
test; and we have the Fourth and Eighth circuits that
yet have some different kind of test.
And one of the things I'd be interested in
hearing your view on at some point is just what the
Chief Justice said, that assuming from your point of
view this is a hypothetical case, nonetheless we would
like your view on which of those tests or some other
test is the appropriate test and why. That was the
question he started with and Justice Kennedy started
with, and I'd also be interested in your view on that.
MS. DRAKE: The appropriate test is the test
that we propose. Under our test, the police act
unreasonably when they convey the impression to an -- to
a reasonable person that entry is imminent and
inevitable. Our test follows directly from the Fourth
Amendment requirement that people in their homes deserve
precision.
By conveying the impression that entry is
imminent and inevitable, the police are -- and they
don't have judicial authority for doing that -- there --
there's no warrant -- they are engaging in behavior that
would confuse an ordinary citizen and make him or her
uncertain about whether the assertion of right to
privacy and security in the home --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Drake if that's
the case, in some way you're agreeing with the
Government. You, too, are saying that -- that there's a
lawfulness test. You're just disagreeing about what's
lawful.
MS. DRAKE: And to the extent that "lawful"
is defined as a synonym for "unreasonable" and to the
extent that there does not need to be a completed
antecedent Fourth Amendment violation, we would agree.
There is area of agreement between the Commonwealth and
I, and it is on the issue of this "knock and talk." Of
course, police officers need to have the investigative
tool of a knock and talk. There's nothing wrong with an
officer attempting to gain consensual entry. And our
position is that that's not made unreasonable by factors
outside the officer's control, no matter how
foreseeable.
JUSTICE ALITO: So what took this outside of
the category of the ordinary knock and talk?
MS. DRAKE: This is not a knock and a --
knock and talk case; this is a knock and announce case
or a knock and demand case, which is how the trial court
characterized it. And the staff --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't know about the
labels, but what did they -- what did the police do that
went beyond what would be permitted under your
understanding of a pure knock and talk? It's -- it's
the volume of the -- of the knocking?
MS. DRAKE: Yes, it's the -- it's the
banging, not knocking. It's announcement --
JUSTICE ALITO: Banging, not knocking?
MS. DRAKE: Banging, not a soft -- not the
knock that you would expect a reasonable person to
engage in, in the ordinary discourse with another
person, or that you would expect from an officer
attempting to gain consensual --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But I -- you -- you might
have considerable support on the Court for the
proposition that if the exigent circumstance is created
by unlawful activity by the police, which would include
conveying the impression that they are about to kick the
door in, then -- then you have a different case. But --
but I thought the case we had before us is what if the
police officers are behaving perfectly lawfully and
they're not threatening to kick down the door, and they
smelled the marijuana and then they hear the motion
inside, does that justify their going in?
And that's what I thought we took the case
for, and that's a different question. You're trying to
-- you're trying to make the police officers' actions
unlawful, and I will stipulate that if their actions
were unlawful you have a different case, and probably
the evidence would have to be suppressed, but I didn't
think we were here to decide that, whether they knocked
too loud, whether they threatened to kick in the door.
The opinion below says if they created the exigent
circumstances, whether they did so lawfully or
unlawfully, they cannot go in. And that's, that's the
issue.
MS. DRAKE: What the officers did in this
case is the functional equivalent of saying "We're going
to kick in the door." Now, I wouldn't go that -- that
far, but it -- it's the functional equivalent of a knock
and announce, which is exactly the behavior the police
engage in when they are executing a warrant. And it is
that behavior that conveys the impression that an
occupant has no authority to keep the officers at arm's
length.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That wasn't the basis for
the decision below, though. The court below didn't say
these police officers were behaving as though they had a
warrant and were about to kick in the door. The opinion
below just said, yes, there were exigent circumstances,
but they were the result of the police knocking on the
door and saying "We're the police."
MS. DRAKE: I don't disagree that the lower
court did not analyze the problem in this fashion, did
not analyze the question in this fashion, but it's a
legal question that calls for an examination of how a
reasonable person would interpret the behavior, and
so --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what does that have
to do with the -- the police officers' lawfulness? Now,
I -- I grant you that attempting -- that there is
something troubling about the police attempting to
coerce entry as opposed to requesting entry, but as my
colleagues have pointed out, it's not clear from this
record which of the two the police did, in a loud voice
or not.
You're saying just a loud knock, a scream,
"Police," that that would be coercive? That's how I'm
reading you.
MS. DRAKE: I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or -- or are you going
further and trying to say that, as a matter of fact, the
testimony's critically clear that they knocked loudly,
said "Police," and said "Let us in or we're going to
bust it"?
MS. DRAKE: The factual record is clear.
The -- Officer Cobb testified he banged as loud as
possible. This is -- this not the normal knock that an
officer engages in when he's seeking consensual --
consent, you know, consent to search, and this is at
:00 at night. He's saying we announced "Police,
police, police!" -- exclamation point. That -- that's
how it appears in the record. Again --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So just assume, for
my sake, that the police comes to the door. It's not
:00 at night; it's, you know, 6:00 at night. Knocks
quietly on the door and says "We're the police. Can we
talk?" And then there was the smell of marijuana. And
then he hears the sounds that do convey to a reasonable
police officer that evidence is being destroyed. At
that point can they enter without a warrant?
MS. DRAKE: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER: But you said -- just add on
to that. Look, the question presented that they raised:
Which of the five tests currently being used by the U.S.
court of appeals is proper? Now, you've said something
about your view on that, but I'd like you to say
anything else you'd like to say about that, which of the
five tests, or some sixth test if you like, and you tell
me the words that you would like us to use when we
answer that question.
MS. DRAKE: I would like this Court to adopt
the test that we have proposed.
JUSTICE BREYER: Which is?
MS. DRAKE: Which is that an officer acts
unreasonably when he or she conveys the impression that
entry into a home is imminent and inevitable.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. But the test
you're using there, the key word is "unreasonable."
MS. DRAKE: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And the reason you
choose the word "unreasonable" rather than the Second
Circuit's test of "unlawful" is?
MS. DRAKE: Because, frankly, I'm not sure
what that means, and I think that's become clear in the
context of this briefing. Does "unlawful" mean the
police have had to violate a portion of the penal code?
Does "unlawful" mean, as the Commonwealth is contending,
that there has to be a completed Fourth Amendment
violation --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know -- you
don't know what --
MS. DRAKE: -- the seizure went forward.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't know what
"unlawful" means, but you know what "unreasonable"
means.
MS. DRAKE: Yes. Unreasonable is the
touchstone of every, you know, Fourth Amendment case,
and so we're saying there does not have to be an
antecedent completed Fourth Amendment violation. The
question is, as is the case in every Fourth Amendment
case, did the officers act --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any doubt that
it's unlawful for a police officer to threaten to burst
into a home?
MS. DRAKE: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So why do you need
unreasonable? If, indeed, there -- there was a threat
of imminent entry -- we're going to bust down the -- if
that was the threat, then it's unlawful, surely.
MS. DRAKE: Yes, and that's why my answer to
Justice Kagan's question was to the extent that
"unlawful" and "unreasonable" are synonyms, we would
agree.
Now, if the Court is not terribly -- does
not find our test convincing, the next-best test, we
believe, is a foreseeability test.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is your test is something
novel? I mean, Justice Breyer mentioned that there are
some five tests in the different circuits, and the
foreseeability test is the one that the Kentucky Supreme
Court used, but is your -- does your test coincide with
the tests of any other circuits, or is it different?
MS. DRAKE: Our test is a novel test. It
has not been, to my knowledge, considered by any of the
other circuits.
JUSTICE BREYER: But your test is -- I mean,
it's not wild. It just says it says "unreasonable" in
the Fourth Amendment. Probably when they act lawfully,
they are acting reasonably and not unreasonably, but it
could be sometimes they're not. That's your view?
MS. DRAKE: That's correct, and by the
way --
JUSTICE BREYER: No test. All right.
MS. DRAKE: -- we're not saying that --
we're essentially saying the police shouldn't act as
though they have a warrant when they don't have one,
which is exactly what they did in this case. And that
proposition is not new. In Bumper, this Court made
clear that if the police act as though they have a
warrant when they don't have one, any consent would be
coerced.
So reviewing courts are already making these
determinations about how loud was the knock and how
aggressive was the demand, simply in another context.
And by the other -- on the other hand, police officers
are already receiving the same instruction that they
would need in order to apply our rule, which is, don't
act as though you have a warrant. Don't engage in the
functional equivalent of a knock and announce if you do
not have prior judicial authority.
And what is appealing about our test, unlike
the foreseeability test, which we believe it's a
refinement of, is it allows for conduct by the police
that's reasonable at its inception to remain reasonable
regardless of the suspect's response, no matter how
foreseeable.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- what is
an example of conduct that you would consider
unreasonable resulting in suppression of the evidence
that would not be unlawful?
MS. DRAKE: Well, it's very hard -- it's
very hard to conceive of where the daylight would be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
MS. DRAKE: -- between those terms,
"reasonable" and "unlawful," so long as "unlawful"
doesn't mean violation of a penal code provision and so
long as it doesn't mean, as the Commonwealth is
suggesting, that there has to be -- that the defendant
would have to first demonstrate that the police were
seized in order to be able to convincingly argue that
the search was unreasonable.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can't --
can't give me one example of some conduct that's
unreasonable under your test that would not be unlawful?
MS. DRAKE: I can't -- I can't think of one,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The problem is that as
reasonable as the test is, it's not the test that was
used by the court below, and you want us to affirm the
decision below, which simply said if the exigent
circumstances are -- are the consequence of the police
action, whatever the police action was -- lawful,
reasonable, whatever -- the evidence has to be excluded.
How can we affirm that decision as you want
us to do, even -- even applying your test?
MS. DRAKE: Well, the factual record in this
case is fully developed, and how a reasonable person
would interpret the scenario is a mixed question of law
and fact, which -- this Court would review the decision
of the Kentucky Supreme Court in that regard de novo
anyway. In that regard, it's no different than any
other case that makes its way to this Court where this
Court is asked to review the record, make a
determination of how an ordinary person would interpret
the officers' conduct.
It is simply unreasonable and unlawful for
purposes of the Fourth Amendment for an officer to
convey the impression that he has the authority of a
warrant when he doesn't have one and when that prompts,
as it obviously would, an occupant of a home to move,
and then that movement is used as evidence that exigent
circumstances exist and warrantless search is justified.
If this Court were to, you know, adopt the framework the
Commonwealth is arguing for, the exception to the
warrant requirement would be the rule.
So we would ask this Court to affirm the
decision of the Kentucky Supreme Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Farley, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA D. FARLEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FARLEY: My time is short, so I would
just like to make a few quick points.
I believe Mr. Chief Justice and Justice
Kennedy were absolutely, absolutely correct. The
question before this Court is: Can lawful police action
impermissibly create exigent circumstances? And the
answer to that question is no.
There is never a circumstance in which
lawful police behavior under a Fourth Amendment analysis
can impermissibly create an exigency. I would point the
Court to Hodari D., which I believe Justice Scalia wrote
for the Court, that we should not punish police officers
for attempted Fourth Amendment violations or Fourth
Amendment violations that do not reach fruition, because
it does not serve the point of the exclusionary rule.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Farley, one of the
points of the Fourth Amendment is to ensure that when
people search your home, they have a warrant. And, of
course, there are exceptions to that. But if there is
one place where the warrant requirement has real force,
it's in the home.
And I think that the concern here -- and you
have some strong arguments on your side, but the concern
here is that your test is going to enable the police to
penetrate the home, to search the home, without a
warrant, without going to see a magistrate, in a very
wide variety of cases, that all the police really have
to say is: We saw pot, we heard noise. Or: We think
there was some criminal activity going on for whatever
reason, and we heard noise.
How do you prevent that from happening? How
do you prevent your test from essentially eviscerating
the warrant requirement in the context of the one place
that the Fourth Amendment was most concerned about?
MR. FARLEY: Well, Justice Kagan, I would
disagree with you. I don't think that it would.
believe that what the Commonwealth is asking for is no
more or no less than reviewing courts have done for
generations. You look to determine whether there was a
Fourth Amendment violation, whether there was an
unlawful entry, whether there was an unlawful seizure,
or whether there was a coercion that then they gained
consent for entry.
If those things occurred, they are clearly
Fourth Amendment violations. There should be a
suppression of the evidence. The exigent
circumstances --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't technically be
a Fourth Amendment violation, would it, if the police
gave the impression that they had a warrant and were
about to kick in the door? Is that a Fourth Amendment
violation in and of itself?
MR. FARLEY: I don't believe so.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So your -- the -- the
unlawfulness test would not prevent that then?
MR. FARLEY: No, Justice Scalia, it would
not.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It would not prevent it?
MR. FARLEY: It would not prevent --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, whoa. Maybe we have to
come up with an unreasonable test, then.
MR. FARLEY: Well, I believe, under
Hodari D., if the officers demand entry and there is no
response to that demand, there is no -- been no
completion of the Fourth Amendment violation. The
officers could stand outside the door --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it's perfectly okay for
officers to do that? To pretend that they have a
warrant and "Open the door or we'll kick it in" --
that's perfectly okay?
MR. FARLEY: Well, I believe that there are
-- there are large restrictions and prohibitions to
that, that officers are well aware of, because if the
person does answer the door, the officers know, well,
everything is going to be suppressed. Or if the
officers do --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But why? You say that what
they've done is not unlawful. Why would it be
suppressed?
MR. FARLEY: Well, if they demand entry and
entry is given, that is then a Fourth Amendment
violation, because they've demanded entry without a
warrant. And in that case, suppression -- once they
have entry, the evidence would be suppressed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they can't gain
entry by deception. They can't knock on the door and
say "Pizza"; right?
(Laughter.)
MR. FARLEY: No.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no? Okay.
MR. FARLEY: We would just assert that under
the lawfulness test, we aren't asking for anything more
or less than this Court has done or other reviewing
courts have done for generations, and this is a simple
Fourth Amendment analysis.
There was no demand in this case. This was
a simple knock-and-announce case, regardless of the time
of day. There was no coercion. There was no seizure.
There was no consent given. Officers should not be held
accountable for unlawful reactions by suspects.
Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
You will have noticed that Justice Kennedy
left the bench a few minutes early. He is going to
