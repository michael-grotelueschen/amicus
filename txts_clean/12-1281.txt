CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 12-1281, the
National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning.
General Verrilli?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
The interpretation of the Recess
Appointments Clause that Respondent urges would
repudiate the constitutional legitimacy of thousands of
appointments by presidents going back to George
Washington, and going forward, it would diminish
presidential authority in a way that is flatly at odds
with the constitutional structure the Framers
established.
Respondent simply has not advanced the
compelling case that would be needed to strip Presidents
of their traditional authority to make appointments
during intra-session recesses and to fill preexisting
vacancies.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You say -- you say
that it would repudiate the constitutionality of
appointments.  You don't suggest that those -- the
actions of those appointees would be invalid going back
however far you want to go back, do you?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, but they -- no, I
don't, Mr. Chief Justice, but it certainly would
repudiate the legitimacy of those appointments.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why not?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How did it -- how did it
affect the -- how many board decisions will have to be
redone, or how did -- how is the board coping with that
problem?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, there are many
dozens of board decisions and, perhaps, many hundreds of
board decisions that are under a cloud as a result of
the D.C. Circuit's ruling in this case.  And so the
board will have a considerable amount of work to do
in -- if the D.C. Circuit's decision were to be
affirmed.
Now, there would be issues about waiver,
there'll be issues about whether there -- there is
authority sufficient to justify what the board did under
other circumstances or apparent authority arguments.  So
that would all have to be sorted out with respect to the
board's ruling --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What would happen if --
under the reasoning of this case, what would happen to
the decisions of recess-appointed judges?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Of which there's been
quite a few.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think that would be a
very serious question, Justice Sotomayor, and I think it
does point up the -- the difficulty with the position
Respondent is urging.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, surely, you would --
you would argue the de facto officer doctrine.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, we would.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, you would.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, we would.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And we've applied that in
innumerable cases.  You don't really think we're going
to go back and rip out every decision made.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I would certainly
hope not, Your Honor, but it certainly casts a serious
cloud over the legitimacy of all of those actions.  And
it does point up the fact that the recess power,
including appointments during intra-session recesses and
to fill preexisting vacancies has been used to fill
offices of great importance.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You started off by
saying -- you know, it would -- it would repudiate so
many actions that have been taken.  I have a very, very
stark question:  Suppose I agree with the court of
appeals that the only -- the only interpretation of --
of the Constitution is that the vacancy must have arisen
during the recess, just by hypothesis.  I agree with
that, okay?
What do you do when there is a practice
that -- that flatly contradicts a clear text of the
Constitution?  Which -- which of the two prevails?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Now, I think the practice
has to prevail, Your Honor, but I do -- and I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So if you ignore the
Constitution --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But I don't think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- often enough, its
meaning changes?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But, Your Honor, of
course, in this situation, the meaning of the clause
with respect to the timing of -- of the vacancy has been
a matter of contention since the first days of the
Republic.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, you're -- you're
questioning my hypothesis.  You have to accept my
hypothesis.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think I've
answered the question accepting your hypothesis, but I
think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's assume that the text
is clearly against you.  Should I say, oh, yes, it -- it
says something else, but the practice for over 200 years
has been something different, and it's the practice that
must prevail.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  The practice has
started with George Washington, and it has worked
through the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes or no?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think -- I think I've
already answered that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does the practice prevail
over the clear text --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  The practice gives
meaning to the -- the practice gives meaning to the
Constitution --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're questioning my -- my
hypothesis again.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I am assuming a clear text
of the Constitution and a practice that is -- is
contrary to it.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It's extremely unlikely
that would arise if the text were so free of doubt.  But
if --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You do not want to answer
my hypothesis.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, I am -- I am
answering.  I think I already answered it once,
Justice Scalia, but I'll answer it again.  The answer is
I think, given this -- a practice going back to the
founding of the Republic, the practice should be -- the
practice should govern, but we don't have that here.
This provision has been subject to
contention as to its meaning since the first days of the
Republic.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me ask you about
the premise.  A vacancy is something that begins at a
particular point in time, and then it continues for some
period.  And I was trying to think of some other things
that might fall into the same category.  One would be an
appointment to a Federal office.
So you were appointed as Solicitor General
at a particular point in time, and the appointment
continues.  Another example might be a marriage.  It
happens at a particular point in time, and it continues
for a -- a period of time.
Now, would we say that your appointment as
Solicitor General is happening today and will happen
again tomorrow and happened yesterday?  Is that the way
the English language is used?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But the word "happens"
may not always be an apt phrase, the phrase "may
happen," the constitutional phrase, but it is a natural
use.  And if I may, Justice Alito, I'll give you a
counterexample.
If Congress had enacted a statute in the
summer of 2008 that said the Federal Reserve is invested
with all powers necessary to deal with any financial
emergency that may happen in 2009, if that emergency
first arose in November of 2008, I don't think anybody
would interpret that statute as denying the Federal
Reserve the authority that Congress conferred.
And that's because "may happen" -- "may
happen" won't cover every situation of a persisting
state, but it's certainly a natural reading of it that
covers some.  And as Jefferson said, it's certain -- in
this context, it's certainly susceptible of being
interpreted to mean --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Verrilli, we've
taken you off your starting point.  Your starting point
was what is it -- what constitutes a recess.  And your
position is that it can be an intra-session recess.  But
if we look back historically, Congress met, and they met
continuously.  And then they went on horseback back
home, and they were away for 6 months, even 9 months.
Today, there's nothing like that.  The
inter-session -- the inter-session recess could be --
could be an hour.  So what do we do with that?  There
was the vision of a long recess running for months, and
today, the inter-session recess might be momentary.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So I think I have two
points to make in response to the question of what to
do.  The first one is that, with respect to the original
understanding, we do think that the term "recess" and
the phrase "the recess" certainly, at the time of the
founding, did encompass recesses that occurred during a
session of Congress, during a session of a
legislature, and not just in between sessions of the
legislature.
I would point the Court to Jefferson's
Manual of Parliamentary Procedure, which describes a
recess by adjournment as occurring within a session.  I
would point to the Adjournment Clause itself, which says
if the -- one house of Congress wants to take a break of
longer than 3 days during the session, it needs the
consent of the other house, which indicates that the
Framers contemplated the possibility of a break longer
than 3 days.
I would point the Court to the parliamentary
practice of the House of Commons, where the speaker of
the House of Commons had authority to call elections
when a member died during the recess.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, of course, Justice
Ginsburg's question points out that your argument is, it
seems to me, in search of a limiting principle.  A lunch
break, a one-day break -- you've -- you've thought about
this -- a 3-day break, a 1-week break, a 1-month break;
how do you resolve that problem for us?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think the -- the way we
resolve that problem is by looking to the Adjournment
Clause.  We think, if it's a break that is sufficiently
short, that it wouldn't require the -- wouldn't require
the one House to get the consent of the other, but
that's a de minimis recess, and that's not a recess in
which the President would have authority --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that 3 days?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what about the pro
forma sessions, then?  They don't -- or correct me if
I'm wrong.  They don't require the consent of the other
house.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, but the problem
with the pro forma sessions, I think, Justice Kennedy,
is in thinking about the length of the recess.  The
recess, we would submit -- and this is based on the
formal dictionary definition of "recess" at the time of
the founding and now, which is "a suspension of
business," the recess was from January 3 when the
session started until January 23.
And the reason I think that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so you think there's
no recess during pro forma sessions?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  There is a recess.  And
the reason is because the Senate has issued a formal
order that no business shall be conducted and that's a
formal --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's just
talk -- let's focus on that.  What, instead of
saying, "No business shall be conducted," the order
said, "It is not anticipated that any business will be
conducted."  Does that suffice to eliminate that period
as a recess?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think that it's a --
that's a different case, and I think, concededly, a
significantly harder case for the Executive because
here --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah.  Well, it's
difficult and harder, but it also suggests that you're
just talking about a couple of magic words that the
Senate can just change at the drop of a hat, so maybe
the point is not that significant.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think it is
significant, Mr. Chief Justice.  It's a formal action by
the Senate by rule saying that no business shall be
conducted.
And then in addition, there are other formal
actions that the Senate took during this period that are
confirming indicia.  The Senate passed -- the Senate
passed a resolution that gave committees the authority
to submit reports and report bills.  They passed a
resolution giving the -- the President Pro Tempore the
power to sign enrolled bills.  It passed --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But General, I think you're --
you're not answering the real thrust of the Chief
Justice's question, which is that we could just be back
here if we -- if we said, well, they didn't phrase this
in the right way.
Well, they'll phrase it differently, and we
would be back here with the same essential problem, that
you're asking us to peg this on a formality that the
Senate could easily evade, and that suggests that it
really is the Senate's job to determine whether they're
in recess or whether they're not.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think there has to be a
limit to that point, Justice Kagan, because, after all,
what we're talking about here is a power that the
Constitution gives to the President, the power in
Article II, and the President has got to make the
determination of when there's a recess.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why?  You're making
an assumption, which is that the Senate has to take a
recess, but the Senate could choose, if it wanted to,
and I think there might be some citizens that would
encourage it to, to never recess.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Sure.  Of course, it
could.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And -- and to work every
day, which --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's true.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- lots of people do.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's true.  They
could -- they could decide not to take a recess.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's absolutely true.
But -- but it seems to me that that is the choice that
the Constitution puts --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So what do you say about
the Twentieth Amendment, which says that that
January 3rd was a meeting?  Are you saying they violated
the Twentieth Amendment?  January 3rd.  This says the
Congress of the United States shall meet on January 3rd
every year, unless they appoint a different day.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And they haven't.  And,
therefore, they met in pro forma session.  Or do you
think it wasn't a meeting?  And what do you think about
the other part of the Constitution, which says they
can't adjourn for more than 3 days without the approval
of the House, which they didn't have.
So are you saying that the Senate violated
those other two amendments of -- the two parts of the
Constitution, or are you saying that they have different
meanings in the three parts?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think our view is that
it's hard to see how the -- what the -- what the Senate
did with pro forma sessions complies with either and --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So you're saying
they violated, if that -- if they have pro forma
sessions on January 3rd, they violate the Twentieth
Amendment to the Constitution.  You are saying that if
they had a pro forma session on January 3rd, that since
their meeting -- their recess was still on and lasted
more than 3 days, it was a violation of that Adjournment
Clause of the Constitution.
Now, that's one way to interpret it.  Over a
long period of time, they have apparently met pro forma
on those days.  Or we could try to make them mean the
same thing, which would mean it was up to the Senate.
They consider that a meeting, it's a meeting.  What do
we do?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Or there is another
option, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Would you write that
opinion, saying the Senate of the United States has
violated two -- two provisions of the Constitution?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, no.  I don't
think you need -- I don't think you need to write that
opinion.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Why not?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Because you might,
perhaps, give the Senate some deference with respect to
requirements that apply only internally to the Congress.
But when what you're talking about is the Senate's use
of pro forma sessions in a manner that deprives the
President of authority that Article II would otherwise
give to the President --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Would it -- would it -- I
mean, that's my basic question, really.  Why is this an
important case?  I see what you're saying on this one.
That's fine for an answer.  Thank you.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So why --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What my really basic
question is why is this an important case, in your
opinion?  Now, you've said, oh, because there are
thousands of recess appointments, not on the happen
clause.
You've listed 7600 or so, really, on the
recess part, but on the happen clause, you've only been
able to find 102.  And moreover, we've had an example
of -- where this Court, for better or for worse, said
that two members of the board is not a quorum, and we
got some more members, they dealt with the problem.
They ratified all those opinions, they dealt with it.
It didn't take them too much time.
So -- and we have different political
parties taking absolutely opposite sides, it seems to
me, or some members thereof, depending on the political
party of the President.  And we have a clause that had
to do with the Constitution and the problem of intra --
inter-session recesses when they were 7 months and
nobody could meet.  Okay.  That isn't true anymore.
So explain to me.  I'm not saying you're
wrong.  I just want to hear from your mouth why this is
an important case.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So it's important for
multiple reasons, with respect to practicalities and
fundamental questions of constitutional structure.
Let me start with practicalities and with
the happens point, the "may happen" point, that our
appendix doesn't purport to be comprehensive or anything
like comprehensive.  Part of the reason why it can't be
comprehensive is that there really aren't records of
when the vacancy first arose with respect to huge
numbers of recess appointments, and that's because, I
submit, it wasn't considered material.
But second, I can -- there are -- there are
numerous practical examples in our history of when it
made a very great deal of difference that the President
had the authority to make an appointment to a vacancy
that preexisted the recess.
We have mentioned the 1948 example; the
Secretary of Labor dies on the verge of a very extended
intra-session recess by the -- by the Senate.  They're
going to be out for a month, back for 12 days, and then
out all the way from June -- they go out in June,
they're out for a month, they are back for 12 days, and
then they're out all the way until December 31st.
The Secretary of Labor dies just in advance
of them going out in June, and this is -- remember, 1948
is a period of significant labor unrest.  They needed a
Secretary of Labor in place.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, would you agree
that this clause now is not mostly used to deal with
emergencies arising from congressional absence?  That
most modern Presidents -- and I say this sort of
going -- going back to President Reagan, Presidents of
both parties, essentially, have used this clause as a
way to deal -- not with congressional absence, but with
congressional intransigence, with a Congress that simply
does not want to approve appointments that the President
thinks ought to be approved?
You know, absence in this day and age --
this is not the horse-and-buggy era anymore.  There's no
real -- there's no such thing, truly, as congressional
absence anymore.  And that makes me wonder whether we're
dealing here with what's essentially a historic relic,
something whose original purpose has disappeared and has
assumed a new purpose that nobody ever intended it to
have.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, two answers.  I
don't think its original purpose has disappeared.  I
mean, the NLRB was going to go dark.  It was going to
lose its quorum.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, as a result of
congressional refusal, not as a result of congressional
absence.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And that gets to the
second point, which is that it may be true, as a matter
of raw power, that the Senate has the ability to sit on
nominations for months and years at a time, but that is
100 miles from what the Framers would have expected.
If you look at what Hamilton said in
Federalist 76 about the advice and consent role of the
Senate, he said he thought it would be a power that was
rarely exercised and would operate, if at all, invisibly
or silently.  And in the early days of the Republic, it
was -- advice and consent was a matter of days, not months and years.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But you are making a very,
very aggressive argument in favor of executive power
now, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with whether
the Senate is in session or not.  You're just saying,
when the Senate acts, in your view, irresponsibly and
refuses to confirm nominations, then the President must
be able to fill those -- fill those positions.
That's what you're arguing.  I don't see
what that has to do with whether the Senate is in
session.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I do -- I think
this -- I think the recess power may now act as a safety
valve given that intransigence, and that is actually
quite consistent --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it isn't -- it isn't
tied then to the availability of Congress,
availability of the Senate.  I think you said throughout
your brief that the rationale for the recess power is
the President must be able to have the government
functioning and staffed even though -- although the
Senate isn't -- isn't around.  But now the -- you seem,
in your answers, to be departing from the Senate not
available and making quite another justification for
this.
The Senate -- I think, to be candid, the
Senate is always available.  They can be called back on
very short notice.  So what is it that's the
constitutional flaw here?  It isn't -- it isn't that the
Senate isn't available.  The Senate is available.  It
can easily be convened.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So let me take a half a
step back, if I could, Justice Ginsburg, and answer that
question in this way -- you know, perhaps it sounds like
this is an aggressive assertion of executive authority,
but I'd ask the Court to think back to Federalist 51.
And what the Framers were most concerned
about was that Congress, in the separation of powers
calculus, was going to amass authority and drain
authority and energy from the Executive, and therefore,
the Executive needed to be fortified against those
actions by Congress.
And one specific way in which the Framers
decided to fortify the Executive was by rejecting the
notion that the appointment power should reside with the
Senate.  The Framers considered that, and they rejected
it.
And the reason they rejected it, as this
Court noted in its Edmund opinion, was -- was to protect
the Executive against encroachment by the legislature.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the compromise
they settled on in moving away from that is that the
President will nominate and the Senate, if it so
chooses, can confirm a nominee.  You spoke of the
intransigence of the Senate.  Well, they have an
absolute right not to confirm nominees that the
President submits.
And it seems to me, following up on Justice
Kagan's point, you're latching on to the Recess
Appointment Clause as a way to combat that
intransigence, rather than to deal with the happenstance
that the Senate is not in session when a vacancy becomes
open.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, but those things --
there are often situations in which the Senate is not in
session when a vacancy becomes open or needs to be
filled, I guess would be the more accurate way to say
it.  The examples -- I'll give you another example, if I
could, from the 1940s.  Taft-Hartley gets enacted in
1947 in the summer.
One requirement of Taft-Hartley is that the
general counsel of the NLRB must enforce the ban on
secondary boycotts within a fixed period of time, 30 or
60 days.  Well, it turns out there is no general counsel
of the NLRB at that time, so President Truman --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the Senate
has -- the Congress and the Executive have come together
to address those sorts of problems in a vast number of
cases by providing that there can be an acting general
counsel of the NLRB to deal with that situation.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, actually,
Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to multi-member boards,
the Vacancy Act doesn't cover them.  That's one reason
we have the problem here.  But beyond that, the Framers
made a judgment that this wasn't going to be left to
congressional largesse.  That's why there is a Recess
Appointment Clause, and it's not left to the Congress.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, let's -- let's talk about your
1948 emergencyof the Secretary of Labor.  There was
a vacancy in -- in that post.  The President has the
authority to convene Congress.  And whatever was the
case in 1948 or -- or in 1789, Congress can be back here
in one day.
Article II, Section 3 says, "He may, on
extraordinary occasions, convene both houses."
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's true,
Justice Scalia.  But the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what's the problem?  If
there is indeed this -- you know, this terrible
emergency you're talking about, the President has the
power to call them back.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think it seems to
me the Framers made a different judgment because they
gave the President both the power to call back in
extraordinary circumstances and the recess appointment
power.  And if the Framers had intended the power to
call back to be the way to deal with vacancies during
absences of the Senate, then --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but my only point is
what -- what the recess appointment power consists of
cannot be determined on the basis that, well, there are
going to be terrible emergencies, so it must enable the
President to do this or that.  Extraordinary emergencies
are handled in the Constitution.  You don't have to
expand the -- the vacancy appointment power in order to
handle those.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So what I would say about
this, and also to your point, Mr. Chief Justice, is we
have, I would submit, a stable equilibrium that has
emerged over the course of this country's history
between the two branches.  After all, what we are
advocating for here is the status quo.  It is the
equilibrium that has emerged since Congress -- since the
Senate started taking lengthy intra-session recesses,
Presidents started making recess appointments during
those recesses.
That began in the Civil War days.  It's
continued to the present.  The President --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, I think that's a
really strong argument, but I have to say I'm not sure
it applies consistently throughout each of the three
claims that you make.  Because if you are going to rely
on history and on the development of an equilibrium with
respect to what "happens" means, and if you are going to
do that again with respect to whether intra-session
recesses are included, then it seems to me you also have
to look to history and the development of an equilibrium
with respect to Congress's definition of its own power
to determine whether they are in recess or not.
In other words, your third argument about
pro forma sessions, the history is entirely on the
Senate's side, not on your side.  And if we're going to
take a kind of continuing practice and the development
of equilibrium seriously, you might win on questions 1
and 2 and then lose on question 3.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, winning on
questions 1 and 2 would be of great importance to the
Executive, but we also should win on question 3, and
here's why:  There isn't a long history reflecting the
equilibrium with respect to the use of pro forma
sessions in order to restrict the President's ability to
use the recess appointment power.
There really is no history before 2007 of
this daisy chaining of one pro forma session after
another after another in conjunction with an order that
no business shall be conducted.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there's no practice --
there is no long practice of doing it.  There is also no
long practice of rejecting it.
But if I could take you back to that, you
said that the pro forma sessions may violate the
Adjournment Clause in the Twentieth Amendment.  Would
you also say that they violate the Presentment Clause,
because the Senate has passed legislation during these
pro forma sessions and the President has signed that
legislation.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, we don't.  I think
the right way to think about that is the same way that
you would think about if the Senate declares that it's
in recess from August 1st until September 15th and then
comes back early because an emergency has happened, for
example, with Hurricane Katrina.  Once they are back in
doing business, they are doing business.
Now, what the Senate did with respect to the
legislation Your Honor identified was they came out of
pro forma session, they passed legislation, and then
went back in to -- they went back in under the order of
pro forma session.  So they take that action --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it seems -- it seems
to me that we're searching here for a proper
interpretation of the word "session," which, after all,
is in the provision that we are looking at.  It talks
about "next session."  And we have a long tradition of
Congress defining what that session is.
They have the first -- this is, what, the
113th Congress?  I think something like that.  And they
have the first and second session.  That's how their
records are based.
This is a considered judgment by both houses
of the Legislative Branch as to what "session" means,
and it seems to me that that has very powerful bearing
on the question of inter- and intra-session appointments
that we are arguing, forget the -- when the vacancy
happens to arise.
And so why don't -- why don't we defer to
Congress as to what the term "session" means and say
that this gives us guidance as to when the -- there is a
recess.  There is a recess between those sessions.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't think that that's
an interpretation that really could be squared with the
body of contemporaneous evidence from the time of the
framing.  And I would start with the text of the
Constitution itself and the Adjournment Clause, which is
at page 91a of the appendix to our brief.
And it -- one thing it says is that,
"Neither house during the session of the Congress shall,
without consent of the other, adjourn for more than 3
days."  It seems clear from that language that "the
session of the Congress" is referring to the period that
commences on the constitutionally prescribed date and
continues until the Congress adjourns sine die because,
otherwise, these recesses wouldn't be during the session
of the Congress.
It's also clear from this language that the
framers at least contemplated the possibility of breaks
longer than 3 days within sessions because they provided
a mechanism to get permission to do it.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But where does this 3-day
rule --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you are relying on
adjournment.  That -- that -- that does not have the
word ”recess” in --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, that's right.  But
I'm going back now to think about what "session" means
in the Recess Appointment Clause where "the session" is
also used.  I would submit, Your Honor, that it means
the same thing as it means here, which is the full
session of the Congress.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If it means the same
thing, then what you are tying the two together, which
actually might have some validity, but wouldn't that
require the definition of a recess to be a period in
which both houses have chosen to consent to an
adjournment?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, I don't think so
because the dictionary definition then and now of recess
is a suspension of business.  And you could have
recesses of that kind, suspensions of business within
sessions.  That's -- Jefferson's parliamentary manual
refers to recess by adjournment --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you have an
adjournment without a suspension of business?  Aren't
the two the same?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I'm just talking
now, Justice Sotomayor, if I may, about the
intra-session recess point.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I'm talking about
tying the two together.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right, but with respect
to -- putting the pro forma issue aside for a second,
with respect to intra-session recesses, the meaning of
the "session," it seems to me, is the session, the full
session, because you can have -- you can have recesses
by adjournment, as Jefferson's parliamentary manual
said.
And as I think I said earlier, there is
quite substantial evidence that the term "the recess" at
the time of the framing could refer to a break during a
session and not just breaks between sessions.  So I just
don't think there is contemporaneous evidence from the
framing generation that would lead you to conclude that
intra-session recesses are not within the meaning of the
word "recess."
JUSTICE BREYER:  What, where is this --
the most surprising thing
to me that you have said, and it's important, is not
just the view of language at the time of the framing,
but what the purpose of this clause was.  I mean, this
is a very well-briefed case, and I have looked at them.
I have read them, actually.
(Laughter.)
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And I’ll tell you, I cannot find anything, so
far, and I may have missed it -- I'm asking -- I can't
find anything that says the purpose of this clause has
anything at all to do with political fights between
Congress and the President.  To the contrary, Hamilton
says that the way we're going to appoint people in this
country is Congress and the President have to agree.
Now, that's a political problem, not a
constitutional problem, that agreement.  And it was just
as much true of President George Bush, who made six
appointments that happened previously, as it is with
President Obama, who's made four.  All right?
So -- so where -- and he says this clause is
a supplement, a supplement, to the basic clause to take
care of the timing problem.  So, what have I missed?
Where is it in the history of this clause, in its
origination, that it has as a purpose to allow the
President to try to overcome political disagreement?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't -- I don't think
that that's -- I don't think that that -- I don't think
that's its purpose, but it is in the Constitution.  The
President has the authority to make appointments --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if it isn't a
purpose, can you give me an example where the language,
particularly that word "happen" -- I mean, your example
was a good one but I don't think it applies, but that's a
different matter.  I can't -- the language is over here.
The number of appointments on "happen" is few.  If you
are worried about James Tobin, Congress has passed a law
that can be taken as looking at a vacancy occurring when
it occurs within 30 days of the beginning of the recess,
which would have taken care of Tobin.
So look at the language difficulty.  Look at
the comparatively small practice in that area.  Look at
the other ways to get around the problem, and then give
me another example in the Constitution where you have
both language and purpose pointing one place and yet
this Court because of practice has come to the opposite
conclusion.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I don't think that
language points unambiguously in one direction.
JUSTICE BREYER:  "Happen?"  Of course,
battles happen.  That's because battles occur over time.
Give me an example with the word "vacancy," where that
word "vacancy" is used with the word "is," but not
"occurred."
GENERAL VERRILLI:  A vacancy is an enduring
state, and from the perspective of the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But just give me an English
example where it’s natural to say --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I tried with my statutory
example before, but from --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Your statutory example has
to do with a battle, not a vacancy.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, it was an
emergency.  It was the statutory example about a
financial emergency that may happen, which is a state,
just like the vacancy.
JUSTICE BREYER:  A financial emergency,
correct.  I'm sorry.  I'm asking you for an example with
the word "vacancy."  That's what I am having trouble
with.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, a vacancy is an
enduring state.  From the perspective of the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not talking about -- I
just say, could you find an example, and I'm gathering,
from my answer, you couldn't.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- and I couldn't
either.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Your Honor, maybe this
statutory -- maybe the language in the Constitution
looks unambiguous to you now, but it has been the
subject of contention, it has been thought to be
ambiguous from the time of George Washington to the
President -- to the present.
And with respect to the question of the
practice and there being -- I don't think it's correct
to assume that because there are a certain number of
identified examples of preexisting vacancies being
filled in our appendix, that that's a sum total.  I
think this is far, far less than the sum total. It represents --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It’s been assumed
to be -- it's been assumed to be ambiguous by
self-interested Presidents.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course.  Death is an
enduring state.  But if someone dies in 1941, you don't
say he died in 1945.  He's still dead.
(Laughter.)
GENERAL VERRILLI:  The fact -- the fact
that -- the fact it happens --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But his death happened in
1941.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But the fact that "may
happen" is a phrase that isn't always apt to describe an
enduring state doesn't mean it's never apt to
describe an enduring state.  It's what Jefferson
thought.  It's what -- it's -- it has been the
understanding, since the framing, that there is
ambiguity here and there --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your -- it's your
argument -- your friend on the other side says one flaw
with your argument is that it makes the words "it may
happen" or "happen during" superfluous, that the clause
would mean exactly what you say it means if you took
those words out.
And your response -- the only one I could
see on the reply -- your reply brief, page 13, is that
those words were put in there to quote, "confine the
President to filling vacancies that actually exist at
the time of appointment."
Now, is that -- do you really think that
they put that language in there because they were afraid
the President would fill appointments that don't exist?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't know why they put
the language in there, Mr. Chief Justice, but it
doesn't -- it isn't superfluous because it does serve
that function, whatever their intent.
JUSTICE BREYER:  One reason they could have
put the language in is because they were afraid,
otherwise, the President would have the power, simply,
when somebody died two or three years before, and
they've had a big fight in Congress to save up all the
controversial nominations and then put them through as
recess appointments.  That could be one thing they
didn't want to happen.  I don't know.  You see, it's the
same problem.  Same problem.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You do have -- you do
have the one that you relied on in your brief, and this
understanding goes back at least to 1823, and the -- the
Wirt letter, Attorney General Wirt said, on the
wording -- maybe on the wording, the case is not strong.
But the purpose, he said, you would be honoring the
letter and defying the spirit.  That was the -- on the
question of the -- when the vacancy --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And we don't disagree
with that.  We think it's just what Wirt said.  It's --
does no violence to the language and is consistent with
the purpose of the -- of the clause.  And from the --
from the perspective of the purpose of the clause, the
office is equally vacant, whether that vacancy arose the
day before or the day after the Senate went into recess.
The Senate is equally unavailable to act
because they're dispersed, whether the vacancy arose the
day before or the day after.  And the public's need that
the office be filled so that the laws can be faithfully
executed is the same whether the vacancy arose the day
before or the day after.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before you -- before
you --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And so you do have that
very established practice that is completely in accord
with the purpose and the structure.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- we sort of drifted
away from the new -- the new practice, the pro forma
session.  And you were asked, suppose there was nothing
in the resolution about they would conduct no business.
It was an informal understanding that they wouldn't.
But there is no express agreement that they're not going
to conduct business.  Then do you lose on that part of
the case?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think that's a way
harder case for us.  I would agree with that, Justice
Ginsburg, and -- but they're two things.  One is that
formalities do matter; and two, going back to the point
you made earlier, Justice Kagan, I think it's not an
accident that there's a no-business order in place.
It's because that's what gives the Senators
the protection to know that they can leave town without
somebody else going to the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose it was -- suppose it
was the exact same no-business order, but the single
senator who was there got up and asked for unanimous
consent to name a post office, and every three days, he
got up and said unanimous consent to name a post office.
The post office is named.
So they can do -- you know, trivial business
in each of these sessions.  Would that make a
constitutional difference?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think if they did
business each of the three days, then you wouldn't have
a situation in which no business was conducted and you
wouldn't meet the definition of a recess.  But that's a
different case than this one.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that, again, suggests
that the rule that you're asking us to establish is --
is so easy to evade that why bother establishing it at
all.  The fact that it's so easy to evade suggests that
this really is -- the question of how to define a recess
really does belong to the Senate.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, I think the problem
with looking at it that way, Justice Kagan, is that
that's the end of the recess appointment power.  You
write it out of the Constitution, if you look at it that
way, because all the Senate needs to do is stay in pro
forma session until 11:59 a.m., on January 3rd when that
term ends and the next term starts, and then there are
no inter-session recesses --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I totally take your point on
that.  But what I'm suggesting is they could just come
back, and by naming post offices, have the same effect,
that they would write it out of the -- of the
Constitution as much as you say this does.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, this does.  This
does.  And whether something else might or might not, I
guess we could try to fight that out if the Senate were
ever to do it.  But I assume, if this Court were to hold
that pro forma sessions of this kind are not real and
they don't defeat the President's recess appointment
power, that maybe the Senate would think twice
before doing something like that.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what is significant is
whether they're available to confirm nominees; isn't
that right?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So suppose they say, instead
of no business will be conducted, no nominations will be
considered.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That would be a different
case because they would be --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I know it would be a
different case, but --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- they would be there --
they would be here.  You know, they're not -- they're in
business for something.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So what?  The point of the
question is whether they're available to consider
nominations.  So if they say, we'll do other business,
but no nominations will be considered, why isn't it
exactly the same for purposes of the Recess Appointments
Clause?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  It's not because the
recess -- or the definition of recess is when no
business shall be conducted.  And that's exactly what
the Senate said.  If I may reserve the balance of my
time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.
Mr. Francisco.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOEL J. FRANCISCO
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FRANCISCO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The Advice and Consent Clause imposes an
important check on executive power.  Each of our three
arguments preserves that check, and provides a separate
and independent basis for affirming the court below.
The government's position, in contrast,
would eviscerate that check, creating a unilateral
appointment power available for every vacancy at
virtually any time with advice and consent to be used
only when convenient to the President.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But your argument would
destroy the recess clause.  There would be -- under your
argument, it is totally -- totally within the hands of
the Senate to abolish any and all recess appointments.
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor.  And that
reflects the fact that the recess appointment power is a
contingent one.  It arises only when the Senate chooses
to trigger it by ending its session and beginning its
recess.  So the Senate always has the power to prevent
recess appointments.
The Constitution, however, gives the
President corresponding powers.  If the President thinks
that the Senate is being derelict in its duties, he can
convene an emergency session, and he can force the
Senate to consider his nominees.
And if they refuse, he can subject them to
withering criticism for being derelict in their
responsibilities.  But one -- the one thing that the
President may not do is force the Senate to act against
its will, nor should the President be permitted to do --
and run around the Senate's refusal to act, because that
conception of the Recess Appointments Clause is at war
with advice and consent itself.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you a variant of
the question that Justice Scalia asked General Verrilli?
Suppose we think that the language in the Constitution
is perfectly clear in some respect, but that there is a
200-year-old consistent practice, agreement by the
President, going back to Washington and by the Senate
that the language actually means something else.  What
would we do in that situation?
MR. FRANCISCO:  Your Honor, I think that the
language has to govern.  And I would like to address the
issue about the consequences of a ruling in our favor in
this case.  Of course, if you were to rule on the third
question presented, it wouldn't call into question any
past recess appointments at all, given the unprecedented
nature of the appointments at issue in this case.
But, frankly, if you ruled on the first two
questions, I don't think it would be particularly
disruptive in terms of calling into question the
decisions of past appointees.
Justice Sotomayor, to take the Article III
courts, for example, since 1960, there have only been
four potentially improper appointments to the Article
III court's recess appointments.  Each of them served
approximately a year or less.  Three were to the court
of appeals, one to a Federal district court judge in
1981.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Francisco, I'm sorry,
but could we go back to Justice Alito's question?
Because I really have the same issue with your argument.
You know, suppose that on one -- let's say
the "happens" argument, that yours is at least the most
natural reading of the statute, at least the way we
understand the word "happen" today, and maybe a
compelled reading, but the history points so much in the
other direction; and that that history brings with it a
whole set of practices and traditions and ways of
dealing with each other that has grown around a certain
interpretation of what "happens" means, right?
The idea that we would wake up one fine
morning and chuck all of that because all of a sudden we
happened to read the clause, I mean, that at least needs
to be defended.
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor, and I
believe that the relevant history actually supports us,
that is the history at the time of the founding.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I know, but now, you're --
you're again -- I mean, assume that there is a
200-year-old established practice, everybody has agreed
to it, but the text, when you really look at it, points
the other way.
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor.  I would
dispute the premises, but I will accept the premises for
the purposes of the question.  The political branches of
the government have no authority to give or take away
the structural protections of the Constitution.  They
don't exist to protect the Senate from the President or
the President from the Senate.
These are liberty-protecting provisions that
protect the people from the government as a whole.  So
if the Constitution is quite clear as to what those
structural protections are, but the political branches,
assuming for the sake of argument, have conspired to
deplete them, that is illegitimate, and it should be
rejected by this Court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that -- but that
assumes something, which is --
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- let's go back to the
"happenings" words -- that is so unambiguous, that they
knew it was unambiguous, but 200-year history, starting
with President Washington, who filled two vacancies that
occurred before the Senate broke, to every -- almost
every President thereafter has done the same.
So why should we conclude that today's
understanding is the same as the understanding of the
Founding Fathers?  Why don't we take their unbroken
practice as giving us that definition?
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor, a couple of
different responses.  First of all, we dispute the
government's historical account of President
Washington's and the first four Presidents' position --
actions.  But even putting that aside here, everyone who
actually spoke to and addressed the issue at the time
agreed that the text means precisely what it says,
including President Madison, who refused to make a
recess appointment to Andrew Jackson, the hero of the
War of 1812, precisely because the vacancy had arisen
during the Senate's session and in its recess.
Second, we also don't have an unbroken and
never-contested practice.  Indeed, the Senate has
regularly resisted.  In 1863, the Senate passed the Pay
Act, which prohibited pay to any appointee to a
preexisting vacancy.  So you don't have a kind of
uniform -- uniformly-held practice.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me ask you this:
Suppose that we were to conclude that the history is
simply too overwhelming to rule in your favor on the
"happens" problem.  Could we still use history to say
that -- or overlook history to rule for you on the
inter/intra-session point?
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How do we do that?
MR. FRANCISCO:  From the time of the
founding --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it because of the
80 years or --
MR. FRANCISCO:  I think it's longer than
that.  From the time of the founding until, I would say,
1948, there was a uniform understanding that the recess
and the session as used in the clause were interchanging
periods.  You were either in recess or you were in
session.  And so an appointment made during the recess
lasted until the end of the next session.
Now, in 1921, Attorney General Doherty's
opinion kind of muddled things a bit because he assumed
that, if you took a long break in the midst of a long
session, it broke that break into two recesses for the
purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause.  But you
still had that dichotomous view subject to the arguable
and quite ambiguous exception of President Andrew
Johnson.
So what you see is from the time of the
founding until 1921 there were some 63 mid-session
breaks, all longer than 3 days, so all recesses under
the government's definition.  Yet during that entire
period, with the arguable exception of Andrew Johnson,
no President ever attempted to make a recess
appointment.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Francisco, tell me if I
am wrong about this, but it seems to me that
intra-session recesses really only arose in the 1940s or
so, right?  There is the period with Andrew Johnson and
Andrew Johnson used intra-recess -- intra-session
recesses to make a lot of appointments.  Other than
that, intra-session recesses of more than 3 days that
are not Christmas simply do not exist.
So that assume that as intra-session
recesses came to be, Presidents started making
appointments in them.
MR. FRANCISCO:  Let me address it this way.
I'm not sure I agree with the factual understanding,
Your Honor.  There were intra-session recesses longer
than 3 days prior to 1867.  I think there were some 10
of them prior to 1867, including 7 that were longer than
10 days.  And bear in mind, yes, they were Christmas
recesses, but so were the ones at issue in this case.
They were Christmas recess appointments.
But I do take your point that intra-session
recess appointments did not become very common -- or I
should say it this way:  Intra-session recess
appointments did not become very common until the -- really
they started with Truman, but then they broke off for a
long time with three Presidents, Johnson, Kennedy, and
Ford, making no mid-session recess appointments.
Then beginning in the Carter and the Reagan
Administrations is when they became very common and
particularly a very common way to do an end-run around
advice and consent.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What happened in that
period at around 1970 is that's about the first time
that you have intra-session -- an intra-session recess
that's longer than an inter-session recess.
And so now if we look from 1970 on, that's
fairly common.  And so all that's happening is that the
Presidents are appointing recess appointees during
periods where they are out for a longer time.  Now, how
are we supposed to go and say that this thing --
thousands of people on the recess part -- is
unconstitutional?
I mean, it isn't unheard of.  What about the
Due Process Clause?  Does that easily cover the
language?  Substantive due process.
What about the Interstate Commerce Clause
and the doctrine of -- you know, the implicit clause
there?  I mean, it isn't unheard of that over time
language in the Constitution takes on a somewhat
different meaning.
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  How do we -- I mean,
probably different judges have different approaches.
But if I'm concerned about the basic practicality and
the basic objective here, why would I agree with you?
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor.  I
certainly am not going to attempt to purport to resolve
this Court's differences on those issues, but on --
(Laughter.)
MR. FRANCISCO:  -- unless you are not going
to let me off the hook, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The two examples that
Justice Breyer gives are examples where we gave it a
meaning that was different from what it said.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We don't have a case
involving this particular issue yet.
MR. FRANCISCO:  That's precisely correct,
Your Honor.  And it reflects the fact that the Recess
Appointments Clause and the Appointments Clause and all
of the structural protections, again, are not meant to
protect the branches against one another.
JUSTICE BREYER:  If I do place more
weight on this, should we -- I mean, I do believe and
agree with you to this point that this is basically a
matter of politics for other branches basically.  That
doesn't help me resolve this.  But it does lead over to
this possibility.  Congress did pass the No Pay Act.
And then they passed the Pay Act.  And in that Pay Act on this
"happen" part, which I think is the strongest -- very
strong for your side, but it defines the vacancy in
terms of 30 days prior to the recess.
And that would take care of most of these.  You
see, if vacancy could be defined as something that
stretches, because Congress says it stretches in terms
of pay for 30 days.
MR. FRANCISCO:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you think of that?
And I would love to know what the SG thinks of it.
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor.  A couple
of different responses.  First, of course, the third
question calls into question no past recess appointees,
the third question.
JUSTICE BREYER:  The third question, by the
way, just put in your mind, if you digress in your
answer, put in your mind what would have happened in
1830 if someone, when they had a 9-month recess, close
to 10 months, someone had the bright idea, well, you
live near Washington; go show up at wherever we are
holding our sessions and sit there for 5 minutes, and
we'll stop President Andrew Jackson from making recess
appointments.  What would we be saying then?
MR. FRANCISCO:  Sure.  Well, I will put my
finger on that question and answer your first question
first as to the Pay Act in 1940.  The Pay Act of 1940,
in our view, clearly repudiates the government's
inter-session view for the reason you put your finger
on.  It ties pay to appointments being made either right
before or after the session ends.
So most mid-session recess appointees can't
get paid under the Pay Act.
With respect to the second question
presented, at best it creates three exceptions to the
general rule against any pay to any preexisting
appointees, so you have got somewhat of a compromise.  I
would say that is no more Senate acquiescence in the
President's position than the President's acquiescence
in the Senate's position when he signed that law.  So to
me that's a jump ball.
Coming back to your historical example, I
think it reflects the fact that the Recess Appointments
Clause is not about timing, it's not a temporal issue;
it's about procedure.  What it does is it creates a
contingent power that arises when the Senate decides to
trigger it.
Back at the time of the founding, the
senators wanted to trigger that power.  It was important
to trigger that power, because when they were gone, the
President needed to be able to act unilaterally, unless
they wanted to be subject to a recall in emergency
sessions every time he needed to confirm nominees.  They
obviously didn't want that.
Today, the situation has changed; not the
principle, but the historical context.  And today, the
Senators can get back to Washington, D.C. very easily.
They are there for much less --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose -- suppose we
have an inter-session break.  It's three days.  On your
reading of the Recess Clause, in that three days, the
President can fill up vacancies.
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor, because
under the second question presented, there would not be
very many vacancies in that context, because the vacancy
would have to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, leave out the
second question.  Just on -- the first question,
because it seems to me that if the rationale was when
Congress was out of town for 6, 9 months, of course, the
President has to be able to make the government work.
But now you're saying that in that time,
it's only three days, they are going to be there
available very soon to confirm.  And let's say
somebody -- somebody dies on day 1.  The President puts
in -- makes an appointment on day 2.  You would say
that's okay?
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor, but I --
first of all, I'd say I don't think you can really
separate it from the second question presented because
that's why -- it explains why it wouldn't have been much
of a problem.  Very few vacancies would arise during a
3-day break, and so there wouldn't be that much of an
opportunity to make those kinds of appointments.
Let's put that aside.  Let me assume you
reject my argument on the second question presented.
Then you're really in the world of the 1905 Senate
report when they were dealing with President Roosevelt's
midnight recess appointments, where he made them
in between gavel drops.
If you reject our argument on the second
question, then I do think that you may need to confront
the notion that an inter-session recess is too short to
make recess appointments.  Not at issue in this case,
because here the appointments came on January 4th, the
day after Congress commenced the second session.  So by
anyone's definition, this was an intra-session recess
appointment, not an inter-session recess appointment.
And all of this really reflects the fact
that the Recess Appointments Clause is a contingent
power that arises only when the Senate triggers it,
which is what gives the Senate the power to prevent the
President from making recess appointments.
If I could turn back to the consequences --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, before you do
so, I mean, is the Senate's power, in your view, so
comprehensive that if they passed an order saying, we're
actually never in recess, people can be reached -- you
know, we can call people back.  So for purposes of the
Recess Clause, we are never in recess.
MR. FRANCISCO:  Your Honor, under the first
question presented, I think the answer is, yes, they
could do that, because it really is the Senate's ability
to trigger the power.
It's -- in a sense, the Recess Appointments
Clause is of a piece with the Inferior Officer's Clause.
The Senate always has the power of advice and consent,
but what the President can do -- what the Senate can do
is authorize the President to act unilaterally in
certain circumstances.
It can authorize the President to act
unilaterally with respect to inferior officers and it
can authorize the President to act unilaterally in
certain time periods where it ends its session and
begins its recess.  So it's always within the Senate's
power.  And that's precisely why advice and consent
serves as an important check.
On the third question presented, I think --
where you're deciding whether or not a session is a real
session, then, no, I don't think the Senate could do
that.  I think that it's for the Court to look at the
Senate's journal to see what the facts are, and those
facts must be taken by this Court as undisputed.
So if those facts show that there was a
Senator who actually gaveled them into session each day,
and that during that period they were capable of
conducting business, as they were here at every session
that they held every three days, then this Court would
have to take those facts as a given.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you -- could you
tell -- let's go back to this.  What's your definition
of a recess?  When the Senate actually says we're taking
a recess --
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- whether it got the
consent of the House or not?
MR. FRANCISCO:  It's when the Senate --
again, it depends on which question you're talking
about.  On the first question presented, the recess of
the Senate is the period between when the Senate says
that it is ending its session through an adjournment
sine die, and the period when it begins its next
session, as the clause says.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does it have to do that?
By what command does it have to do that?
MR. FRANCISCO:  Sine die?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.
MR. FRANCISCO:  It does not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  Sine die or any --
MR. FRANCISCO:  It does not have to adjourn
sine die.  That, though, in this country, is the way
that the Senate has traditionally signaled to the
President that it was ending its session.  And I think
that's what it would have to do.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does it need the consent
of the House to do that?
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor, it does.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So -- so does it have to
do that in between the two congressional sessions?
MR. FRANCISCO:  I don't -- I think -- no, I
don't think it has to.  I think the Senate can adopt its
own rules for determining how it ends its session and
how it begins a new one.  I think the important point,
though, is it has to communicate that to the President.
So, for example, during President Madison's
time, the tradition was the Senate would dispatch a
committee to the President to inform this President that
it had ended its session.  So the President now knew
that it was in recess and the powers that imbue upon the
President during that recess had been triggered, the
recess appointment power.
Here, ruling on our -- in our favor on the
third question would, of course, call in the question no
past appointees.  But I would like to --
JUSTICE ALITO:  On the first question, does
your argument depend on the fact that -- on the
assumption that the -- the possibility of a lengthy
intra-session break was never even contemplated by those
who framed and -- and ratified the Constitution?
Because if they had thought about that, there's a real
chance the Senate may take a two-month break --
MR. FRANCISCO:  Right.
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- over Christmas.  Would
there be any reason why they wouldn't have wanted the
recess appointment power to apply there as well as at
the end of the session?
MR. FRANCISCO:  Your Honor, our argument
does not turn on that because to us, it is not a
temporal question; it's a procedural one.  Back then,
the Senate had the power not to trigger the recess; just
like today, it has the power not to trigger the recess
appointments power.
The difference is not in principle; it's in
historical context.  At the time of the framing, they
wanted to trigger the recess appointments power because
when they left during long periods of time, they wanted
the President to be able to act unilaterally since it
was very difficult for them to get back.  And if they
didn't trigger the power, the only way the President
could act unilaterally would -- the only way the
President could confirm nominees would be by convening
an emergency session.  Highly inconvenient.
The historical facts today have changed.
Not the principle, but the surrounding facts.  And
today, it is very easy for the senators to get back to
Washington, D.C., and so they don't want to trigger a
unilateral power.  They're perfectly willing to be
hailed back if necessary.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm -- I'm not sure I
understand the answer.  If the purpose is to permit the
President to fill vacancies when the Senate is
unavailable to consider nominations and the country
would be harmed by having these offices vacant for a
period of time, why would that not apply to any lengthy
break, whether it's at the end of the session or in the
middle of the session?
And so if you're arguing that it only
applies at the end of the session, doesn't that depend
on the assumption that they never thought about the
possibility that there would be a lengthy break in the
middle of the session?
MR. FRANCISCO:  Your Honor, it is possible
that they never thought about it.  But even if they had,
I don't think it would matter, because I think that --
that the purpose that you've laid out is not quite the
full purpose of the clause.  The purpose was also to
ensure that the President could not easily do an end-run
around advice and consent, which after all is the
principal method of appointment.
And so what they did, as they did with
respect to inferior officers, is they vested with the
Senate the power in certain circumstances to authorize
the President to act unilaterally.  With respect to
recesses, that authority was triggered when the Senate
decided to end its session.  The Senate did, for
example, take 7 mid-session breaks of longer than 10
days prior to 1867.  It is inconceivable to me that the
senators at that time believed that they were entering
into a recess that would have empowered the President to
make unilateral appointments during those 10-, 11-, or
12-day periods.  And that reflects the fact that the
Recess Appointments Clause is a -- is a contingent one
that arises when the Senate triggers it.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Francisco, can I ask a
question about the second question presented, the
"happens" question?
MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And if you put aside all the
history and you look only at the language and you look
only at our own modern view of what happens, that surely
seems to favor your position.
But -- you know, given all the statements
in the founding period itself about how this is
ambiguous and it might have two meanings, if you look at
the dictionaries of that time -- so I went back and I
looked at the Oxford English Dictionary, and one of the
definitions of "happens" there is "chance to be,"
essentially the exact same definition that Thomas
Jefferson said made this ambiguous.
And we would never use "happens" in that way
now.  If you look at the examples that the Oxford
English gives, they're laughable.  Nobody would ever say
that now.  But it just suggested to me that maybe what
we think is pretty clear is only pretty clear because
one meaning of “happens” has -- you know, over
200 years --
MR. FRANCISCO:  Sure.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- lapsed.
MR. FRANCISCO:  Well, Your Honor, I actually
think the word "happens" had the same meaning then as it
does now, which is why at the time of the framing
everyone who actually studied the issue -- Madison,
Hamilton, both of the first two attorneys general,
Edmund Randolph and Charles Lee -- agreed that it meant
what it said, as did even --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I don't think so, right.
Essentially, Thomas Jefferson says it could mean one
thing or the other, and the other thing that he said,
which is "happens to exist," is sort of exactly this old
definition, which is "happens" means "chance to be."
MR. FRANCISCO:  And then Jefferson in his
other letters conceded that the Recess Appointments
Clause as it stood was going to frustrate his ability to
make appointments.  And he therefore described --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I think "happens"
continues to mean "chances to be."  We still use it that
way.  But we only use it that way when it is followed by
an infinitive.  "I happened to see him," it means a
chance that I saw him.  Or -- you know, 9/11, the
destruction of the Twin Towers happened to occur on
9/11.  But you wouldn't say -- you wouldn't say it
happened on -- on 9/13, simply because it continued to
be destroyed.
I don't know what the OED examples that
Justice Kagan referred to were, but I bet they -- they
used "happen" followed by an infinitive, and I think we
still use it that way.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, I don't remember
them exactly.  I just remember kind of laughing at them,
as things that --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  Actually, I think I
remember what they were --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- nobody would say --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and they were 1483 and
1490-something, and then there was an asterisk that said
"obsolete."
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  And in fact -- in fact, I
couldn't figure out what they were talking about.
MR. FRANCISCO:  And, yes, Your Honor, but in
addition, though, there -- there is not just the word
"happen."  It's preceded by three other words, that --
"vacancies that may happen."  And the only purpose that
those words serve is to constrain the universe of
vacancies that are eligible for a recess appointment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the Constitution as
it -- as it first was has now been amended and it is no
longer a part of the Constitution, with reference to
appointment of Senate, uses the word "vacancy" in much
the same way as the clause we're discussing here, and I
think favors your position, because if a vacancy happens
by resignation during the recess of the legislature then
the governor can make the appointment.  And you
certainly wouldn't think that that could happen over 3
days --
MR. FRANCISCO:  Exactly, Your Honor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- occur over -- I should
say occur over 3 days.
MR. FRANCISCO:  And -- and it's even better
than that because at the time of the framing, a
legislator -- a governor tried to appoint somebody to
the Senate pursuant to that clause that had arisen --
where the vacancy had arisen during the legislative
session rather than during the legislative recess, and
the Senators actually refused to seat that individual.
So, yes, that further supports our position
on that.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you want to say anything
before the -- about the -- the language on the "happen,"
I support you.
But the -- the practice, and in particular,
the practicalities, because you say, well, the President
can make an acting appointment, make a recess
appointment even.  I mean -- you know, they have much
less authority, somebody appointed in that way, much
less than a person who's been confirmed by the Senate.
So if the government won't grind to a halt, it still
faces a problem.
MR. FRANCISCO:  And Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you want to say
about that?
MR. FRANCISCO:  That's a consequence of
advice and consent.  That problem arises not just when
the Senate takes breaks, but when the Senate is in
session.  The Senate could show up every day for an
hour, sit at their desks, and announce to the President:
We're not going to do anything, no nominations, no
legislation, because we don't like what you're doing.
And by the way, the only reason we're showing up here at
our desks and sitting here for one hour a day is because
we don't want you to be able to make recess
appointments.
Nobody would claim that the Senate was in
recess during those sessions.  Well, that is effectively
what it was doing here.
I would, though, like to address the
practicality issue.  I talked about how there have only
been four recess appointments to the Article III courts
that are potentially invalid since 1960.  I likewise
don't think, if you were to rule in our favor on the
first two questions, that it would be particularly
disruptive to the Executive Branch either.
If you look at the government's appendix, I
would hazard to say that most of those officials
probably don't exercise much, if any, agency rule-making
or adjudicatory power at all.  But as to those who do,
going forward the government can solve the problem
through agency ratification of past decisions.  Going
backward, there are a variety of doctrines that would
limit anybody's ability to actually challenge those past
actions, including, for example, the APA's 6-year
statute of limitations on challenging final agency
action, various finality rules that would prohibit a
party from raising an issue that they could have but
failed to raise in an earlier proceeding, and various
justiciability doctrines, like mootness, standing, and,
Your Honor, the de facto officer doctrine, at least
outside of the context of direct appeal.
I think this constellation of issues
probably explains why this is the first time this issue
has reached this Court in 225 years.  This is not to say
that a ruling in our favor on the first two questions
wouldn't have any past impact.  It would undoubtedly
have some.  But as this Court's decisions in cases like
Chadha and Booker and Blakely make clear, this Court has
never shied away from enforcing the strictures of the
Constitution simply because it could have some impact on
prior cases.
Here the structural protections of the
Constitution exist to protect the liberty of the people.
They were clearly transgressed with these unprecedented
appointments, and therefore we believe that the court
below should be affirmed.
I am happy to answer any additional
questions that Your Honors may have.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Estrada.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA,
FOR SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL, ET AL.,
AS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ESTRADA:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
As Justice Kagan recognized earlier in the
argument, this case fundamentally is about who gets to
decide whether the Senate is in recess, the Senate or
the President?  Our submission today is that the Senate
gets to decide whether the Senate is in recess.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Estrada, you said in
your brief that that was true within wide limits.  What
are the wide limits?
MR. ESTRADA:  This is -- this is all about
how the Senate chooses to arrange its affairs, Justice
Kagan, under the Rules of Proceedings Act.
And what the Court said in the Ballin case
was that the exercise of rulemaking authority by
Congress was almost absolute and beyond the challenge of
any body or tribunal unless it usurped some independent
constitutional authority.
The only possible offer here that the
Solicitor General has as to how the Constitution could
have been violated by the actions of the Senate in
arranging its own affairs is the notion that this has
invaded the purported recess appointments power of the
President.
And the reason, as we say in our brief, why
that is completely insubstantial is because, as the
Solicitor General recognizes in the closing two pages of
its brief, the Senate by the design of the Constitution,
the Appointments Clause, the primary method of
appointment, has an absolute veto over nominations.
The Framers could not have been more clear
that the standard power of appointment was a joint power
of appointment.  And therefore, the Solicitor General is
forced to concede that this appointment power, this
right that the President is asserting here as a stop on
the exercise of the rulemaking authority, is a
subsidiary power that only arises if the government --
if the Senate, excuse me, chooses to recess.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is the Chief Justice's
example before, if the Senate just said, we're -- we're
never in recess for purposes of appointments, would that
be permissible?
MR. ESTRADA:  If the Senate says, we're
never in recess, and the Senate then is not in recess so
that it can exercise the duties of its office as it
does here, yes, it would be.  If the Senate says, we’re
checking out and going to Hawaii, we'll never again be
in Washington, Kona is very nice this time of year, that
would not be permissible, because, A, the Adjournment
Clause requires the consent of the House for the Senate
to be not only gone for 3 days but to be in a different
place.
And -- and second -- you know, the Senate
cannot leave -- you know, the chamber, and -- other than
with the -- with the consent of the House.  And maybe if
the Senate has effectively given up -- you know, the
business of legislating, in that case, maybe the
President could say that it is, quote, a "recess."
Now, the fundamental problem with the
President's position here is twofold.  We have Senate
records.  There is -- the Journal Clause of the
Constitution directs each house of the Congress to have
a journal of its proceedings.  The Journal of the
Senate, which is in relevant part printed in our
appendix, shows that on each of the disputed dates the
Senate was called to order and then adjourned.  It is an
official record of the Senate.  It says the Senate was
called to order and then adjourned.
It doesn't say two guys who happened to be
Senators met at a bar and had a beer.  The official
records of the Senate say the Senate was called to order
and adjourned.  And under the Rules of Proceedings
Clause, that ought to be conclusive, full stop.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the end of it,
exactly the same, if this all took place during the
9-month inter-session recess in 1835.
MR. ESTRADA:  It would be the same, unless
the Senate chooses to recess.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  Exactly, same
facts.  Same facts.
MR. ESTRADA:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And, therefore, in your
view, the clause, even if they were all scattered to the
winds in 1835, there would have been not possible for
President Andrew Jackson, if I have that right, to make
the recess appointments.
MR. ESTRADA:  Justice Breyer, the executive
at the time could have attempted to construct the same
type of argument that the executive is trying to
construct here --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  But your view would
be the Court should reject it.
MR. ESTRADA:  Yes.  But -- but here, it is
even a weaker argument because one of the oddities of
the case is that as the Senate has -- and the country
have all moved into the modern age, the rules of the
Senate tend to provide for the Senate to be available at
the drop of a hat.
If you look, for example, at Rule 9, you can
always get -- you know, the communications from
Houses -- from the House or from the executive.  If you
look at Rule 26 of the Senate, committees can meet
whether or not the chamber is actually in session.
You know, the business of the Senate is
ongoing; and therefore, in the modern world, it is even
much, much, much different than even the hypothetical
that you posited.
JUSTICE BREYER:  You say anything that
would -- on this, if you want to, that would turn it
back to the practicalities.  Imagine, hypothetically,
that I would have thought President Theodore Roosevelt
acted unconstitutionally when he tried to make all of
his appointments, dozens and dozens, during a
two-second --
MR. ESTRADA:  In 1903.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes --
inter-session --
MR. ESTRADA:  Yes, constructive recess.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes.
MR. ESTRADA:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And by converse reasoning,
the Congress would not have been able, in 1835, to
prevent recess appointments simply by having a nearby
senator show up for a -- for one second, once every 3
days, over a 9-month period.
It seems to me what goes around comes around
in this -- in this --
MR. ESTRADA:  Well, let me -- let me take
that as an opportunity because I think it does
raise -- you know, the question to speak to the
implication that the Solicitor General makes in his
brief, that the Senate, as a body, doesn't have a view
on whether it was in recess or in session.
For the reason that I started out by
outlouding -- by outlining -- excuse me -- the Senate's
official records do show that the Senate was in session
on each date, and therefore, the Senate does have an
official view.
But from the practical point of view, we do
know that the Senate has a view on these things.  And
how do we know?  The President's party controls the
Senate.  If the Senate wanted to recess, Rule 22nd of
the Senate says that's not a debatable proposition.
If a majority of the Senate wants to recess,
even before the evolution of the filibuster,
non-debatable proposition.  So the Senate says, which is
controlled by the President's party, says, we want to
recess, we want to go away, we don't care if the
President has this power.  They vote for that.  House
says no.  What happens then?
Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution,
the fight goes to the President, and it is in that event
that the President gets to adjourn them until such date
as he shall see proper.
So if the Senate had any view that it wanted
to recess, they could have had a vote, and the issue
would have ended up in the White House, in the lap of
the President.  He had plenary constitutional power to
give himself an inter-session recess by terminating the
session and have a real recess appointment power if he
could find somebody whose vacancy had actually arisen at
the time.
But this is the cockeyed way of going about
the instruments of the Constitution.  There is no power
in the Constitution to use the Recess Appointments
Clause to overcome the opposition of the Senate to the
President's nominees.  And for all that we hear about
today, which has to do with how the heaven will fall,
and the parade of horribles, there is no parade, and
there is no horrible.
The only thing that will happen is that the
President, heaven help us, will be forced to comply with
the advice and consent that the appointments power --
excuse me -- the Appointments Clause actually calls for.
That was not viewed as an evil by the Framers.  That was
what the Framers unanimously agreed was going to be the
principal means for appointments for the principal
officers of the union.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Estrada --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If there is a 3-day
recess between sessions, then your argument is that is --
that is a recess and the President can make -- can make
appointments in that time.
MR. ESTRADA:  Justice Ginsburg, that is a
very interesting and somewhat difficult question.  On
the facts of this case, there is a substantial question,
which no one really has litigated, as to whether there
was, in fact, an inter-session recess, whether the first
session of the 112th Congress ended on the morning of
January 3rd and therefore, we have the same Teddy
Roosevelt situation, or whether by adjourning on
December 30th and contemplating no further meetings
until January 3rd, whether that in effect -- in effect
was a sine die adjournment that ended the first session
of the Congress.
If the President had the same view about the
nature of the pro forma sessions, he could have taken
the view about the sessions between December 17th and
January 3rd and could have had a better legal argument
in attempting to claim that between December 30th and
January 3rd, there was at least an arguable
inter-session recess.  And he did not do that.
Why didn't he?  Because by waiting until the
convening of the first session -- of the second session
of the 112th Congress, by making an appointment on
January 4th instead of the morning of January 3rd, he
gives an extra year to his appointees to serve.  That
shows that this is, indeed, the bottom of the slippery
slope on the Recess Appointments Clause.
It is a complete abuse of the process.  It
is being used for no other purpose than to overcome the
Senate opposition or the Senate disinclination to agree
with the President's nominations.
What the Framers contemplated in coming up
with a joint power of appointment was you have to act
jointly.  You have to play nice.  And in a country of
300 million people, when the President wants a nominee
and the Senate does not agree, it is always possible for
the President to come up with another nominee who is
even more qualified and acceptable to the Senate.
The key here is acceptable to the Senate.
He has to be able to proffer someone to the Senate that
the Senate is willing to engage in a joint power of
appointment.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Estrada, in your
earlier example, you said that if the Senate decides to
recess and the House doesn't approve, that the President
can then do it.
Is it your belief that a recess is only
something that both Houses have agreed to?  A break in
business that both Houses have agreed to?
MR. ESTRADA:  I don't think so.  It is
usually the case, Justice Sotomayor, but not
necessarily.  The example I would give --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do you need --
why does the President have to adjourn the House in your
example?
MR. ESTRADA:  No, I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If the Senate votes
tomorrow to recess --
MR. ESTRADA:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- can the President
appoint, at least in your view, any vacancy that occurs
during that recess?
MR. ESTRADA:  If the Senate has been
recessed without date so that the session of the Senate
is over, even if the President, under Article II,
chooses to leave the House in session --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why do you need a date?
What -- what -- in what rule makes a recess defined as
something without date?
MR. ESTRADA:  This takes us back to the
first argument, and I think the contemplation was that
the recess would be the period of time that intervened
between the ending of a session of the Congress and the
beginning of the next.  Here --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It always had a date,
because we knew January 3rd was a new session.
MR. ESTRADA:  Well, that wasn't true until
the 20th Amendment.  You know, the date was a much
different date in the original Constitution.
But to answer your earlier question, it is
usually the case that a recess is going to be longer
than 3 days, but it needn't be.  If the Senate finished
all of its legislative business, for example, in this
year on December 30, 2011, and then voted to adjourn
sine die, and did not again meet until the beginning of
the second session of the Congress on January 3rd, that
would be an inter-session recess even though it would
not be one that would require consent of the House.
But in the usual case in which a recess is
taken for an extended period of time, it would be the
type of break that the Framers contemplated would need
the consent of the House.
And the reason for that should be obvious.
We have a system of a bicameral legislature.  The houses
too are supposed to work together to accomplish the
business of the people.  If the House is working on
something and the Senate wants to go away, or
vice-versa, they need the consent of each other because
they may need each other to frame out ongoing
legislative projects.
And if the House in its own judgment thinks
that the Senate is sufficiently available to the House
in our bicameral system so that it -- so that it has been
full compliance with the Adjournments Clause, it is
very difficult to see how in the agreement of both
houses of Congress that the Senate is in fact
effectively available, that is there with its full power
of unanimous consent every third day.  If the House
thinks that that is adequate for the discharge of its
constitutional functions and the constitutional
functions of the Senate, it's very difficult to see how
the President gets to second-guess that.
One final point that has to do with the
Solicitor General's insistence on the no-business
language.  Rule 5.1 of the Senate -- may I finish?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
MR. ESTRADA:  -- makes very clear -- it's
also in our appendix -- that any business may
conducted – may be conducted at any time, without notice,
by unanimous consent.
And so that effectively, what we have here
is merely an announcement by the Senate that between

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice.
Let me begin with a couple of points on
intra-session recesses.  With respect to the question
that Justice Alito raised, it would have been perfectly
familiar to the Framers that a legislative body could
take an intra-session recess.  Jefferson's parliamentary
manual written while he was Vice President and presiding
over the Senate specifically refers to recesses by
adjournment that occur within a session and the session
resumes when they are over.
The adjournment clause itself contemplates
the need for approval by the other branch for a period
longer than three days during the session.
I think it's difficult to imagine that if,
as Justice Alito's hypothetical suggested, that the
Senate had in the first years under President Washington
decided to take a two-month, intra-session break, that
President Washington wouldn't have been able to staff
the offices of the fledgling republic using the recess
appointment power.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if we agree with you
on the first question, then there needs to either
be a number or a functional test.  And I don't know
where the number would come from and I don't know how
the functional test would play out, so maybe you could
say just a word about that.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  We think the number
should -- should be the number in the Adjournments
Clause, 3 days or less.  Now, Presidents have exercised
restraint and there haven't been recess appointments in
periods below 10 days, but we think that would be the
line.  Now --
JUSTICE ALITO:  The presence
of that in the Adjournments Clause but the absence of
any number in the Recess Appointments Clause, how do you
explain that?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think that there
isn't really a need for explanation.  A recess is a
suspension of business, and what the Adjournment Clause
says is if you are gone for 3 days or less you are not
really suspending your business, but if you are gone for
more than 3 days you are.  And I think that is quite
consistent with the argument that my friends on the
other side are making.
Now, with respect to the history on
intra-session recess appointments, really if you look at
the congressional directory, which is a document that we
cite in our brief, and you just look at the column that says
intra-session recesses, you will see page after page of
blank space until you get to the Civil War era when
intra-session recesses become more frequent.
And intra-session recess appointments really
just precisely parallel the increasing use by the Senate
of intra-session recesses.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you argue that
the Senate sort of acquiesced in that and everybody's
come together, but what would you expect a Senator to do?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, if they --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You know, the
President appoints somebody during a recess contrary to
the Respondent's view, what's the Senator who objects to
that supposed to do?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, a couple of things
about that, Mr. Chief Justice.  The Pay Act, of course,
was first enacted in this period, in the 1860s, when the
first intra-session recess appointments occurred. The Pay Act,
even in its original form never said -- and since,
never said anything about trying to restrict
intra-session appointments.
If the Congress felt that these were
improper, they could have done what they did in the
Tenure of Office Act and passed a statute of making it a
crime for somebody to take one of these appointments.
But they didn't do anything like that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you would
object to that, wouldn't you?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Of course.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  On the same grounds
that you're objecting here.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, we would.  But in
terms of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then that's
not something that is effective for the Senate to do if --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But in terms of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- you think it's
unconstitutional.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But in terms of an expression
of their disagreement as opposed to acquiescence it
would certainly be a question of disagreement, and it
didn't happen.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that’ll show them. The Senate
says we don't agree with your recess appointment, and you
say, well, that’s too bad, the appointee is still in
office.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But they didn't, I guess,
would be, or the point being --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, some of the Senators did --
Senator Byrd --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- senators --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- famously objected
to the President's assertion of that power.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yeah, but he famously
objected to it, Mr. Chief Justice, by saying that the
intra-session recess ought to be 30 days or longer, not
that intra-session recesses are inappropriate as a
matter of constitutional power.
So I actually think that is just haggling
about the length of the recess, not about the existence
of the power.
Now, if I can move to the question of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I just want to
make sure I understand.  Your idea is the Senator who
objects should do what?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, the Senator who
objects can say whatever the Senator wants, but we don't
have a historical record of objection.  We have a
historical record of acquiescence.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But suppose the
Senator says, look, I object to that, I think it's
unconstitutional, but I'm not going to -- what can I do?
The only think you do is impeach the President,
right, for violating the Constitution.  And he says it's
not worth it for the -- one of the officers on the NLRB --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, if the Congress as
a body thought that these were inappropriate they could
take legislative action to try to limit the President's
authority, and they just, they never have.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you say
that action would be totally ineffective?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, we agree on
the -- we certainly agree on the criminalizing point,
but in terms of the Pay Act, for example, they just
never in all their -- in their original consideration of
the Pay Act and subsequent, they never tried to
address this.
Now if I could turn to the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But people object all the
time to things that in fact they can't do anything
about, right?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And, yes, Your Honor, and
of course -- and that's an individual objecting and it's
not the Senate objecting.
JUSTICE BREYER:  The question of reports.
There were reports, remember?  Sorry, I didn't mean
to -- your six minutes couldn't be up already.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Take a few more
minutes.
(Laughter.)
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I was thinking the same
thing, Your Honor.
There were a couple of committee reports but
I believe those were on the "happen" issue, and let me
turn to that, if I could.  Now Your Honor had pointed
out the number of – on happens, the number of appointments.  As
I said, don't take that chart as comprehensive.  As we said
in our brief, it's not; we think there are many more,
and of course 39 Presidents have made those
appointments.
Now, the purposes of the clause as we
discussed earlier, I think, are far better served by our
reading than the other side's.  Jefferson gave a
reasonable textual reading, and then Your Honor asked
about the Pay Act.  The Pay Act of course says if the
nomination -- if the vacancy arose within 30 days, but
it says something else, too, which is if a nomination is
pending --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, but I'm focusing on
30 days and the reason I'm doing that is this seems to
me, hypothetically at least, a real matter for the
political branches to resolve among themselves.
Now, we have to decide this, so I thought,
well, why not look and see what Congress objects to the
least?  And I got that 30-day thing from the Pay Act by
analogy.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I guess what I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So I want to get your view
on that.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, of course.
And what I would point out by analogy also
is that there is another provision in the Pay Act, the
very same statute, that says so long as a nomination is
pending, even if the vacancy arose more than 30 days,
that's the same expression of Congress's views about
what's appropriate.  What they care about is the chance
to exercise their advice against the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that was that Senate.
I mean, that's not the Senate that is sitting now.  You
are attributing the views of one Senate to the Senate
over -- over time.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That is an expression of
the law of the United States that the Congress enacted.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm really interested in
how you think the 30-day idea, if practical, plays out
in terms of your concerns.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think it, as I
said, I think there is an equilibrium here and the
30 days doesn't fully capture it.
And let me just talk about that if I could.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Briefly.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice, briefly.
The vast majority of appointees are
submitted for advice and consent.  That was true
historically; it's true now.  The vast majority of
recess appointees are subsequently confirmed.  So it's
just not the case that this is an end-run around the
advice and consent role of the Senate.
And there are powerful reasons, of course,
why Presidents do that.  They don't want to have
temporary appointments that they have got to then deal
with vacancies again, and they don't want to
unnecessarily create inter-branch friction.
The real problem, I would submit here, is
that if you go with Respondents on the pro forma issue
or under the -- on the two underlying issuesthat the D.C.
Circuit ruled on, you really are writing the recess
appointment power out of the Constitution, and that's
antithetical to the liberty-enhancing properties of
separation of powers that Madison described in Federalist
51, because ambitions should counteract ambitions. They
shouldn't disarm one side.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.
The case is submitted.
