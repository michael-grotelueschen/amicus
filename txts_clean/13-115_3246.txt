CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
this morning in Case 13-115, Wood v. Moss.
Mr. Gershengorn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit held that individual
Secret Service agents could be held personally liable
for their on-the-spot decision to reposition a group of
about 200 to 300 demonstrators who were within weapon's
range of President Bush as he made an unscheduled -- as
he made an unscheduled stop for dinner at an outdoor
restaurant patio.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I ask a question?
So were the pro-Bush demonstrators.  In fact, the
pro-Bush demonstrators were across the street pretty
much at a diagonal to the President, and they were
permitted to remain there the entire time.  He -- they
had a throwing distance of a bomb or a shooting distance
as well.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, the
pro-Bush demonstrators were differently situated from
the anti-Bush demonstrators in several fundamental
respects.  With respect to the weapons range, there --
there was a two-story building between the pro-Bush
protestors and the -- where the President was dining.
It's in stark contrast to the open alley that led down
precisely to the six-foot wooden fence behind which the
President was dining, which is where the anti-Bush
protestors were.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That was after the
second move, not the first.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  No, Your Honor.  At the
first move, when the President arrived for dinner,
the -- the pro-Bush protesters were on the north -- the
anti-Bush protesters were on the north side of
California Street between Third and Fourth, and the
alley that led right down to the restaurant patio was
right there.  The -- they were at the head of the alley.
So they were very differently situated from
the pro-Bush protesters.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, I don't understand
the government to be making the argument, and I can't
understand why it isn't making the argument, that it
doesn't matter whether there was any intent to suppress
anti-Bush demonstrations, that in this area, as in
traffic stops, we don't consult subjective intent.
If -- if a policeman stops somebody,
and it's, oh, you stopped me only because I was coming
back from an anti-Bush demonstration, we wouldn't -- we
wouldn't listen to that argument.  We'd say, did you
have a broken taillight or not?  If you had a broken
taillight, we do not inquire into the subjective intent
of the officer.  Why is it any different here?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I don't
believe we are avoiding the argument that Your Honor
suggests.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You haven't made it.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  We don't think it's -- I
think, Your Honor, with respect, that we have.  Our
position is that it is not clearly established law, that
if there were an objectively reasonable --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't even have to get
into that.  You don't have to get into clearly
established law.  It's a very simple case.  If you say,
was there objectively a reason to move these people?  If
there was, if you had an ulterior motive that was
unconstitutional, we don't inquire into it.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, we agree with
that.  We just have framed it as terms of -- in terms of
clearly established law, that if we think along the
lines of what this Court said in Reichle with respect to
retaliatory arrest, if there is an objectively
reasonable basis for the move -- for the repositioning,
such as a valid security rationale, it's not clearly
established that the presence of animus would be enough
to take -- to raise a constitutional --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, do you agree with
that, Mr. Gershengorn?  Because you have these
hypotheticals in the last page of your brief where you
say that a complaint could survive a motion to dismiss
if the Secret Service members had, you know, announced,
had admitted that they had an intention to discriminate
or if they had told the local police that.
So I took what you were saying there to say,
if there is evidence of a very clear nature, that it was
all about animus and it was nothing about security, then
the complaint would survive.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I think
that the way we reconcile the two positions is the
following:  If there is no objective legitimate security
rationale, and it is animus, we agree that it would be
clearly established law that the officers could not have
taken -- the agents could not have taken responsibility
-- could not have taken the actions.
However, if on the record there is an
objectively reasonable security basis, then we don't
think it's clearly established that, even if the
individual officer didn't take the action for that
reason and took it for animus, that it's not clearly
established that that is a constitutional violation --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you get oblige us by
answering Justice Scalia's question.  Forget clearly
established.  What do you think the law is or ought to
be?  If the only motive for the officer's action, for
the Secret Service action, is one based on viewpoint
discrimination, but that nonetheless there was an
objective reason that could have justified the action,
what should the outcome be there as a matter of law?
Forget clearly established.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  We don't think they've
stated a constitutional violation in that context.
However, what the Court did in Reichle --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- what does that
answer mean?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That means there is no
constitutional violation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you -- so you say that
any time there is an objective basis for the Secret
Service to act to move a protester, the fact that this
wasn't the motive at all, but that it was viewpoint
discrimination is irrelevant.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I want
to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that your position or
is it not?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That is our position, but
I don't think that's what we need to win this case.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I know that, but the reason
that you -- the reason I think these questions are being
asked, my impression is exactly what Justice Scalia said
in respect to a Fourth Amendment case against a police
stop.
But my impression also is that where you
have a First Amendment case and it's not against the
policeman, against Secret Service, this Court has not
said that.
Am I right about that?  And the reason that
your position, if I am right, is relevant is because I
think maybe we shouldn't say that for the first time in
a case where the government hasn't even argued it.
MR. GERSHENGORN:
JUSTICE BREYER:
answer to what I just said?
MR. GERSHENGORN:
JUSTICE BREYER:
am I right on part two?
So, Your Honor, I --
Now -- and what is the
The answer to your Honorâ€™s --
Am I right on part one, and
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, you are right
on part one.  The Court has never held it.  What the
Court -- the closest the Court has come is in Reichle
where what the Court said was in a case of retaliatory
arrest, it was not clearly established -- the Court
didn't reach the constitutional question.  The Court
said it was not clearly established that where there was
objective probable cause for arrest, retaliatory animus
was not relevant.
We think a number of the same factors that
motivated the Court in Reichle could motivate the Court
here as well, were they to reach that question, and I'll
explain why in a second.  But we do not need to win on
that question because it's not clearly established.  So,
Your Honor, with respect --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, we all know you don't
need to win on that question.  The question is:  Should,
in your opinion, the Court reach that question.  And my
hesitation would be that it is one thing to talk about
ordinary policemen.  It is another thing to talk about
First Amendment matters where we are engaged with a kind
of special protective force, and certain residences
there that make -- residences that may make a person
hesitate to extend into that area.  And so what is the
government's view?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I've been
asked the government's view on a couple of things, so I
want to be very clear.
The question of what is our position is the
position articulated by Justice Scalia.  The question of
what we need to win, it's qualified immunity.
The question of whether the Court should
reach the constitutional question, I think our answer
would be no, that the parties haven't breached it as
Your Honor said, that the normal course would be to do
what the Court said in Reichle and say that it's not
clearly established.  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I can't understand why you
didn't brief it then in that case.  I cannot understand
why you didn't brief it.  And -- and talking about
things that we haven't -- haven't held in the past, we
haven't even held in the past that -- that there is a
Bivens cause of action for a First Amendment violation,
have we?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do we have any cases that
has held that?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  No.  And we agree with
that, but the argument was not preserved below, so we
have not presented it here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that a
relevant -- well, what is your position on that?  Is it
pertinent in analyzing qualified immunity that there's
no private right of action for the asserted
constitutional violation?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  We do believe, Your Honor,
that it is -- it is -- the Court would have jurisdiction
to reach it because it's a logically antecedent question
and that it would be something that the Court could
consider.  It's not something --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I don't mean
what the Court could consider.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I want to know
whether or not -- well, the question is simple.  Can you
only -- can you not violate the Constitution if there's
no right of action against you, or do you look and say,
well, whether there's a right of action or not, it still
violates the Constitution?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I think that
the presence of -- the Court's hesitant to recognize
Bivens and the factors that go into the -- that gave the
Court hesitance to extend Bivens to First Amendment
claims are relevant to the analysis here.  We didn't
raise this argument because it wasn't preserved below,
but we do think the very same factors that should --
that would give the Court pause about recognizing a
Bivens actions are the ones that would cause the Court
to reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision here.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, on -- on the merits
of the case, if you were called to brief the Secret
Service, what would you say in response to this
question:  Do we have any duties under the First
Amendment when we are protecting the President with
respect to crowds and -- and people that are close to
him?  Do we have any First Amendment duty?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, we would --
first of all, as the policy -- I know Your Honor hasnâ€™t
asked this, but I just want to make clear.  There's a
policy that would generally prohibit the Secret Service
from doing that, an internal policy.  With respect to
what the Constitution --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Theyâ€™re asking about a
law, they say we want to know what the law is.  We're
law enforcement officers.  Will you please tell us what
the law is.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  I would say, Your Honor,
that the law is not clearly established.  This Court has
never held that the Secret Service --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They said that's why we've invited
you to lunch, so that you will tell us what the law is.
(Laughter.)
MR. GERSHENGORN:  And we may yet get
clarity.  But as --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You actually are arguing
that it's not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that it's not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- have an answer to this
question, please?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Answer Justice
Kennedy's question.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  We would tell -- I think I
would have to say in candor, Your Honor, that in part
because of some of the discussion we're having, that we
think the better view of the law would be if you have an
objective security rationale for the action, that the
retaliatory animus would not render that
unconstitutional.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, can I ask you a
question?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  But I would have to say
that that's not clearly established and there's a
rule --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think it's not
clearly established that you can't discriminate
solely -- I've used the word "solely."  No security
reason, no nothing.  You can't discriminate solely on
the basis of viewpoint?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's correct, Your
Honor.  We agree with that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's constitutionally
established?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  And I take that as
different from the hypothetical that Justice Scalia
proposed.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no.  Let me
go --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Okay.  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- step by step.  You
agree that's clearly established.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  What you
don't think is clearly established is a mixed motive
case.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a different
issue.  So the question here is:  Is this a mixed motive
case or not?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- the other side,
I think, is saying it's not, that there was no valid
security reason, no objective security reason for this
move.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  And I think our response
to that, Your Honor, is we would agree that's clearly
established.  If there were -- if no reasonable officer
could believe there was a security rationale and it was
only on the basis of animus, then it would be clearly
established.  We believe --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not a mixed motive.
Why -- why do you accept the description of that as a
mixed motive case?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  I don't think that -- I
don't think Justice Sotomayor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you agreed with my
hypothetical, the point is it doesn't matter what the
officer's motive was.  It does not matter.  If there's
an objective basis for a traffic stop, even if his sole
motive was discriminatory, the stop is nonetheless
valid.  This is not a mixed motive issue.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I took Justice
Sotomayor to be asking me a different question:  If
there is no objective security rationale, which takes it
out of Your Honor's hypo, then we agree it is clearly
established and we believe this complaint fails because
they have failed to satisfy Iqbal.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then don't -- just don't
call it mixed motive.  It confuses everything.  It
confuses everything.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  No, that I don't think is
mixed motive.  But what Justice Sotomayor was asking
was, I thought, something different, which is that --
whether there is a sort of Mount Healthy but-for
causation.  And I would say -- I just want to be very
clear what our position is here.  I know I'm being asked
on the merits, but just to get our the position on
qualified immunity.
It is not clearly established that taking
viewpoint discrimination into account in a security
situation violates the Constitution.  It is not clearly
established that if there is objective security
rationale, even if you act then in animus, that that
would violate the Constitution.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  But we agree --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito has
been trying to get a question in.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  No, no.  It's certainly not
your fault.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO:  This question about the --
the issue that you've been addressing in response to
Justice Scalia's question.  In -- in the Fourth
Amendment context where it is purely -- the inquiry is
purely objective, we have case law on what is reasonable
suspicion, what is probable cause.  Now, if you apply
that to a First Amendment case where there -- where it's
asserted that there is a security -- there may or may
not be a security concern, would it not be necessary for
us to identify a -- a degree of suspicion or probable
cause that the Secret Service would have to have before
making -- before moving people for security reasons?
I imagine whenever the President is out in
public, there is some degree of risk.  You want no risk?
You know, keep him in a bunker.  So at some point -- do
you see what I'm saying?  They --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  I do, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  The Secret Service has to
make a decision about how much information they need
before they can -- they should move people or change a
route or something like that.  So the courts would then
have to set that standard.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I think it
would have to be a very deferential standard and it
would -- and I think that that is proper under this
Court's case law.
If I could attack that in sort of two ways.
The way the Court addressed this issue in Reichle we
think is quite parallel to how it would address it in
this First Amendment context.  What the Court said in
Reichle was:  First, the existence of probable cause in
that case is likely to be an issue in every -- in
virtually every case.  And we think in this situation,
the existence of a legitimate objective security
rationale, in part because that's what the agents do and
in part because of statute that -- that requires the
agency to protect the President, a legitimate security
rationale is likely to be in every case first.
Second, what the Court said in Reichle was
that it's very difficult to distinguish animus from the
proper use of reliance on protected speech because --
because the Court has recognized that it is valid at
times to take into account the nature of one's speech
in -- in making arrests and other security decisions.
And the same would be true here.
And we think there's a third factor here
which is important, which this Court has recognized,
that the physical security of the President occupies a
special place in our constitutional structure, as
Justice Breyer put it in his Rubin dissent, and that the
Secret Service has a special role to play.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you say that under
your view of the case, that there is a First Amendment
interest that protesters have, but that it is virtually
unenforceable in the context of crowd control?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  No, Your Honor, we would
not say that.  We think there are --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because it seems to me
that if this complaint doesn't survive, nothing will.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I'd like
to address that in a couple of different ways.  First of
all, there's a very big difference between whether
there's a Bivens action stated and whether there are
other ways to enforce constitutional rights.  So it is
possible and there have been suits that have sought
injunctive and declaratory relief before things like
inaugurations, political conventions, even just regular
presidential visits.  Those would be unaffected.
Second, there are -- there are situations in
which plaintiffs, and there are pending challenges now,
have challenged Secret Service policies, for example a
Secret Service policy that no -- that bars certain
supports for signs from a parade route.  That's being
challenged now in the court.
And then if there are Bivens claims, we
think there are allegations that would survive.  But we
do recognize that this would -- that -- that a ruling on
qualified immunity here would cut back on damages claims
against individual agents, but we think that's
appropriate in light of the difficulties they face.  The
agent --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You know, I really -- I
really don't understand what the government is doing
here.  It seems to me you want to win this case, but not
too big.
(Laughter.)
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  In -- in light of the
arguments waived below and the arguments not made here,
you want us to find for you, but on the narrowest
possible ground.  I would think it is in the interest of
the United States and the Secret Service to say there
are no Bivens First Amendment actions, but you don't
make that argument.  Didn't make it below; don't make it
here.
Likewise, it would be in their interest to
say, oh, this is just like a traffic stop.  It doesn't
matter whether we had a -- a bad motive so long as there
was an objective reason, that's the end, but you don't
make that argument here either.  I -- I really can't
understand what the government is trying to do here.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, we are -- we
are doing our best to make with the arguments that we
have before the Court.  We think that the -- that the
qualified immunity standards that we have articulated
and the position on clearly established law we have
taken is sufficient for this Court to decide the claim.
Although.  As I've tried to say, we agree with both of
the propositions that Your Honor has said and in a
properly preserved case we would be likely to address
them.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Gershengorn, suppose
that we changed the facts here and that both the
pro-Bush demonstrators and the anti-Bush demonstrators
were in the same place and they were at the foot of the
alleyway, so that there was an objective security
rationale, but that the Secret Service members -- and
they were in all respects the same except that they had
different signs.  Some signs say the President is great
and some signs say the President is terrible.  And the
Secret Service members had only removed the ones with
the signs that said the President is terrible.
So what would your analysis of that be, both
under the clearly established, but also, I want you to
get to what you think the law is there.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  All right.  So under --
under clearly established, Your Honor, I think we do
think that that would make a plausible case that there
-- that the agents acted without a valid security
rationale because they -- because they moved the
anti-Bush protesters, but not the pro-Bush.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think you're changing my
hypothetical, or let me just explain my hypothetical.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Okay.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I put them both at the foot
of the alleyway because that meant that both have a
straight shot, you know, that they can throw a grenade
into the patio, which is, I take it, what the nature of
your objective security consideration is.  So that's
true of both of them.  But you only move the ones that
say the President is terrible.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So we would say, Your
Honor, first on clearly established, that it is not
clearly established that the Agency couldn't do that,
but we recognize that the Court is -- is concerned about
that situation where an agent -- an agent has a
legitimate -- an objective security rationale, but acts
solely on the basis of animus and I think it would
support that kind of inference.  But I would urge the
Court to think, as it thinks about it about the flip
case, which is an agent who has an objective security
rationale --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But just -- just tell me
what your answer to that case is.  What do you think --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  The answer is it would not
be clearly established, that they --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And do you think it would be
unlawful?  Forget clearly established.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  The government's position
is if -- although we haven't briefed it in this case --
the government's position would be the one articulated
by Justice Scalia.  But we recognize that is not
something that the Court has yet held and so I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't think that's
responsive to Justice Kagan's hypothetical.  Justice
Scalia's hypothetical, there is an objective reason for
stopping the car.  It's violating traffic regulations,
which is the broken taillight.  I understood my
colleague's question to be there is no objective
security rationale.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  I'm sorry.  I had
understood it differently.  Did you believe -- I thought
you were saying there was an objective --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I said both can throw a
grenade into the patio area, but in fact you only remove
the people who have the anti-President sign --
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So I took the fact --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- notwithstanding that the
security consideration applies to both equally.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  So I took that to be that
there is an objective security rationale, and I think in
that situation, we would say that the -- A, it's not
clearly established -- but that we believe that the
better answer is the one from Justice Scalia because
there's an objective security rationale.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no.  I thought
the question was there's no differential security
rationale.  In other words, maybe it's not the question
my colleague asked, but I'll --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, that is.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- I'll ask it.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Okay.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let's say you have
to move the President in an emergency situation.  You've
got two options, go through the anti-Bush crowd or go
through the pro-Bush crowd, and you've got to do it
right away.  Is it a justified security rationale to say
that we think it's more likely that it will be
problematic if you evacuate the President through the
anti-Bush crowd than through the pro-Bush crowd?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  We do not think that would
be unconstitutional, Your Honor.  But --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So in other words,
the viewpoint itself constitutes a security
consideration?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's what this Court
said in Reichle, that there are times, not that it
inevitably --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so, your answer to
Justice Kagan is that it would be proper if you have
only 15 minutes, a limited amount of time, to move the
people with the -- with the adverse -- with the signs
that criticize the President?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's correct, Your
Honor.  We think that that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So your answer to Justice
Kagan is that there is no violation if they move just
the Bush protesters.  That's your answer.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  That's correct, Your
Honor.  But I -- and if I could just say a word or two
about the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know -- I
thought what the Chief was going to say, there's no
differential reason to move one or the other.  Let's
assume you have an equal amount of time, you can get
everybody moved, and you just are choosing to move the
Bush -- anti-Bush demonstrators.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I understand
that this is an unattractive hypothetical for the
government's position.  And if I could explain why
nonetheless I think it's the right answer because the
flip side is if you have an agent who has a legitimate
security rationale and is going to move against somebody
who's hostile -- who's showing a message that's hostile
to the President, you don't want that agent to hesitate.
That's what this Court said in Hunter.  The Court said
in Hunter there are times when we don't want a
reasonable official to hesitate before he acts and
nowhere is that more important than when the specter of
presidential assassination is in order.
But I want to be crystal clear that we don't
need that -- I think I've said that before, but I just want to
make sure -- that we don't that to win.  It just has to
be clearly established.  If I could --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, suppose I add to my
hypothetical and I say -- and the Secret Service goes to
the local police and says -- and, you know, doesn't talk
about grenades at all and really just says we have got
to get these anti-President people out of here because
they're annoying the President; let's do it right now,
and that's what they do.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  I think, Your Honor, that
at some point you would cross over into a position where
you would say there -- there is a real question about
whether there's an objective security rationale and we
would be in a situation --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, there is one.  I mean,
there is one in a sense of as we look back, we can see
that there's an alleyway and that somebody could have a
grenade, but there is evidence that that's not at all
what was in the heads of the Secret Service members.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I recognize
that that is -- as I said, I think that is a -- that is
the -- the hardest case for us and I recognize that's
why Your Honor posed it.  But I urge Your Honor to think
about from the flip side, which is if you adopted the
rule that Your Honor's question would -- not attributing
to you, but might lead one to adopt, that the result is
an agent who has a legitimate security rationale but is
operating against people who are expressing a viewpoint
must hesitate.
And I think it's important in this context
to remember that what we have are Secret Service agents
who are making on-the-spot judgments while protecting
high-level officials.
JUSTICE BREYER:  We understand that and I
think that that's the problem, and I think you're being
sort of picked at for this reason in my mind, and I
don't know if you have an answer to this.  I know
everyone understands the importance of guarding the
President in this country.  Everyone understands the
danger.  You can't run a risk.  At the same time, no one
wants a Praetorian Guard that is above the law, and we
have examples of history of what happens when you do
that.  So everyone is looking for some kind of line that
permits the protection but denies the Praetorian Guard.
And if you have anything to say that we're immersed in
details about how to get to that general objective, I
would love to hear it from either side.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, very briefly,
then I'd like to reserve.  I think the simplest way to
reserve it is actually -- to resolve this, is to hold
that it's not clearly established, that it's a mixed
motive case; it is not clearly established that the
situation Justice Scalia posed would be
unconstitutional; and that under Iqbal, that the
plaintiffs have not alleged what they would need to
allege under clearly established law, that it was the
sole motive for their actions and there was no
objectively reasonable security rationale.
I'd like to reserve the balance, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Wilker.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. WILKER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WILKER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Plaintiffs have pled a plausible claim
for intentional viewpoint discrimination in violation of
core First Amendment principles.  We have done so for
three interrelated reasons and we've pled it as a sole
cause.  This was solely the cause, not security
rationale, but the sole cause of the move here was the
viewpoint being expressed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would you have taken the
same position if all that had been was the first move,
that is, the move to Fourth Street?  Then there would
have been about an equal distance from the pro-President
demonstrators.
MR. WILKER:  I think that would be a more
difficult case for us to prevail because we wouldn't
have one of the prongs on which we rely, which is the
disparate treatment as one of the factors we rely on to
establish the inference of intent.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then would you say
that you would have no tenable case if they moved them
just the one street over so they wouldn't be in a
position to throw a hand grenade to the patio?
MR. WILKER:  I think as a practical matter,
we would probably -- we would likely not have as tenable
a case as we do.  If in fact the only reason for the
move was the officer's intent to move the anti-Bush
demonstrators further from where they were so that they
could be heard less well, that would in our view state a
claim for relief.  It would be a more difficult claim
because we are trying to establish intent and we're
trying to establish intent from the inferences from the
various facts that occurred that evening.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, do you acknowledge
that -- that the issue here is whether the law was
clearly established?  Do you agree with that?
MR. WILKER:  I think the -- I think we
believe the law was clearly established by this Court's
precedents.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not saying whether you
believe it is.  Is that the -- if you find it wasn't
clearly established, do you lose, is what I'm saying?
MR. WILKER:  Well, I think this Court's
qualified immunity precedents make that clear.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Now, how can it be
clearly established if we have never held that there is
a Bivens cause of action for a First Amendment
violation?  We've never held that, have we?  How can you
possibly say that the violation here is clearly
established.
MR. WILKER:  I think you can, Justice
Scalia, hold -- find from this Court's decisions in its
viewpoint discrimination holdings, like Rosenberger,
like R.A.V. v. St. Paul, like Pinette, where the Court
has clearly made it clear that viewpoint discrimination
is a pernicious form --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, it is pernicious.  But
is there a Bivens action for it?  The Constitution does
not create a cause of action for this.  1983 doesn't
cover this.  We invented it out of -- really out of
nothing, and we have not extended that to First
Amendment violations up to now.
MR. WILKER:  Up to now.  And that argument
was not made below, nor preserved to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, regardless of whether
it was made below, it certainly goes to the argument
that was made below and here, that the violation here
was not clearly established.
MR. WILKER:  Well, I think it's different to
say whether or not there is a remedy for the violation
as to whether the violation was clearly established.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, okay.
MR. WILKER:  The violation was clearly
established.  Whether or not there is a remedy for that
violation under Bivens --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a good point.
MR. WILKER:  -- is a different question.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a good point.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Wilker, let's
say something happens back in the patio area where
you -- you're the head of the Secret Service detail.
You've got to evacuate the President right away.  Do you
go through the anti-Bush crowd or through the pro-Bush
crowd?  You've got to decide right now quickly.  I'm
serious.  You have to make a split-second decision.
Which way do you go?
MR. WILKER:  I think whichever way provides
the clearest egress.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  They are
both the same.  That was one of your propositions, that
there is no way to distinguish there.
It's too late.  You've taken too long to
decide.  It's a serious point.
MR. WILKER:  It is a serious point.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You've got to decide
like that.
MR. WILKER:  But that's not the position
that -- that's not the position the agents were in on
October 14, 2004.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  I know.  But if
we're trying to decide whether viewpoint can ever be a
security justification, we have to consider all of the
possible situations.
So again, if you had to decide right now do
you go through the anti-Bush crowd or the pro-Bush
crowd?  Guns are going off, explosions.  Which way do
you go?
MR. WILKER:  I truly don't know the answer
to your question because I'm not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Really?
MR. WILKER:  -- a security expert.  I don't
know where the guns are coming from.  I don't know what
the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're the farthest thing
from a security expert if you don't know the answer to
that one.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's actually not much
of an answer for lots of reasons, but the most, if you
don't know, how are we supposed to know?
MR. WILKER:  Well, because that's not the
issue that's presented to this Court for decision today.
We're -- this is not a case in which the Secret Service
made a split-second judgment as to which evacuation
route to take with the President.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but with
respect, my point is that we do have to adopt a general
principle, and if we say viewpoint can never be a
consideration, then you have to say when there is an
emergency going on, it's just as likely there will be a
problem if we go through the pro-Bush demonstrators or
the anti ones, which seems to me to be, on its face,
implausible.
MR. WILKER:  Well, in the context of an
emergency, there may be a different rule than there
would be in the context of a considered decision to take
viewpoint into account in making a decision, which is
what we have alleged here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So then you think
there -- well, there may be situations in which
viewpoint alone may be a security consideration.
MR. WILKER:  There may be.  And I think if
there were individuals directly in proximity to the
President, not, you know, 90 feet or 80 feet away, but
directly, could the Secret Service take into account, I
think that's what this Court said in Reichle, is that
the Court can into account where it said in the
proximity of the President, or in that case the Vice
President.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Wilker, do you concede
that, looking back on this just in a hindsight kind of way,
that there is an objective security rationale here, that
they are standing at the foot of the alleyway, that you
could throw a grenade into the patio area?  Do you
concede that just looking at the situation and not
thinking, not taking into account any evidence of what
was in their heads, that there in fact is an objective
security rationale for moving people from this area?
MR. WILKER:  I think if you -- if the
concern was the mouth of the alley and that the riot
geared police guarding the mouth of the alley were not
sufficient to protect the alley and protect against that
kind of incursion, the more simple solution in this case
would simply be to move people slightly to the east or
west where they had buildings between them and the
President.
JUSTICE BREYER:  The question is, what is --
there are so many different theories floating in this
case that I've had a hard time trying to figure out what
you want me to decide -- on what theory you want me to
decide.  Is your allegation that the Secret Service
agents were motivated in part by security reasons and in
part by bad -- what you would say, bad viewpoint
reasons?  Or is your theory the Secret Service was
motivated only by viewpoint and zero by security?
MR. WILKER:  It's the latter.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's the latter.  Okay.  So
then if it is the latter, I think you're hearing the
government saying, yes, that is clearly established,
that they could not in fact be motivated only by bad
viewpoint reasons and zero by security, and therefore,
you have stated a claim, if your complaint does say what
we both just agreed you wanted to say.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think the
government has conceded that.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Maybe they
didn't and I have to decide that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think the government
conceded that at all.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Then I would have to
decide is it the case that if the Secret -- if the
Secret Service was motivated not at all by security and
a 100 percent by viewpoint, does that state a claim?
Now, weâ€™d running into the Bivens problem, et cetera.
But leaving all that out of it, the next
question would be, which I haven't heard argued yet,
which is why I raised this, what more do you have to do
than state a claim?  5 years ago, I would have thought
nothing, that if you have an absurd claim, I'm not
saying it's absurd, but if it were absurd, a district
court could deal with that.  They would deal with it by
giving you 5 minutes of discovery and then saying hum,
or 10 minutes plus summary judgment.  Or have you really
certified this under Rule 11?  Are you kidding?  Be
careful.  Or you know, they have five or six different
weapons.  Now, that is what you're arguing, I think.
But then along comes Iqbal.
MR. WILKER:  Uh-huh.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, it's a long way of
focusing you on that question.
MR. WILKER:  And so in Iqbal, this Court
said to be plausible it has to be something more than
possible.  But it -- plausibility is not probability.
And the way we establish intent is rarely through the
admission to a local law enforcement or to someone else
that the agent acted for an impermissible reason.
What we do to establish intent is plead
facts from which intent can be inferred.  We believe we
have pled -- pleaded facts from which intent can be
inferred, both with respect to the disparate treatment,
with respect to the time that elapsed from the
President's decision to dine, from the time he sat down,
and then 15 more minutes until the decision was made to
move the demonstrators.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Iqbal says a
little bit more than that, not that you just have to
allege facts.  In Iqbal, and just quoting here from page
681, the Court goes on to consider the factual
allegations in the complaint to determine if they
plausibly suggest an entitlement, and they go on to say,
but given more likely explanations, they do not
plausibly establish this purpose.
So based on just your complaint, we have to
determine whether there are more likely explanations.
And we have in your complaint the idea that they are at
the front of the alleyway, it's a six-foot wooden fence.
Can we -- we certainly can look at those in deciding not
simply whether you've pled the cause of action, but
whether it's more plausible than those other
justifications.
MR. WILKER:  I think, though, once we meet a
certain threshold of plausibility, unless the competing
inference is so compelling to make our claim
implausible, that it involves at the pleading stage such
a great burden that no plaintiff could ever satisfy it.
The Secret Service or any defendant could always --
could always articulate some rationale for their action
that would create a competing inference.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's what we said
in --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Wilker, sorry to take
you back to this, but in this --
MR. WILKER:  Right.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- case, do you concede that
a reasonable officer, even if not these officers, these
officers might have had a terrible motivation, but that
a reasonable officer could look at this map and say,
look at the distance between the alley and the outdoor
patio, you can throw an explosive in there, that seems
really bad, let's get these people out of the way?
Could a reasonable officer have said that?
MR. WILKER:  Could a reasonable officer have
said that, that given the proximity?  Certainly that's a
possible conclusion.  I can't say that that's an
impossible conclusion.
But the answer to that -- it doesn't,
because the answer to that is to take a measured
response consistent with the Secret Service's own
guidelines, which is not to take viewpoint into account,
to be respectful of those First Amendment rights of
people who are demonstrating on the public streets in
the center of town.  This is core.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And have you -- you've
conceded that there would be a security interest, in the
hypothetical that Justice Kagan raised, that there are
-- people are in front of that alley where they could
throw a grenade.  Once you concede that, then you say,
but the security interest, the valid security interest
is washed away because, in fact, it was reported.
MR. WILKER:  I think there's a distinction.
Could there be a security interest?  Yes, there could
hypothetically be one.  Was there one?  We say there was
not, for the reasons articulated in our briefs and for
the constellation of facts that we have alleged in our
complaint.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not sure I understand
that, because it seems to me there either is or isn't a
valid security interest.  Now, whether they acted
because of that valid security interest is, of course, a
different question, and you might say, well, there was a
valid security interest, but that's not why they acted.
But as to the first question, I mean, there
either is one or there isn't one, no?  And we look at it
and we say, what would a reasonable police officer think
of the security interest here?  What would a reasonable
police officer do?  Would he clear this area or not?
MR. WILKER:  The -- the question is whether
proximity alone of a peaceful group of protesters is
enough to create a security; and in hindsight, you could
look at that and you could conclude that.  I
respectfully disagree that that means there was one on
the evening in question.  That's a factual question.
Was there, in fact --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You say in your complaint,
"The Defendants claim that Defendant Secret Service
agents told Tao and the police defendants that the
reason for the Secret Service's request or direction was
that they did not want anyone within handgun or
explosive range of the President.  To the extent the
agents, in fact, made such an assertion, the assertion
was false, and the Defendant Tao and police defendants
knew or should have known that it was false."
So you think it's false.  They think it's
true.  That's called a dispute of fact.  And the normal
circumstance is that the judge has various weapons at
his disposal, legal weapons, to try to prevent -- to try
to prevent court's time being wasted, officer's time
being wasted and other's time being wasted on factual
allegations that are unlikely to be true.  That was true
before Iqbal as well as after.  That's your position,
isn't it?
MR. WILKER:  Well, yes and no.  I mean, I
think "unlikely" may be the wrong word.  And this case
in -- Court in Swierkiewicz said it doesn't matter
whether the case -- it's not a question of whether the
case is likely to be proven true.  The question is have
you pled enough.  Now, clearly that preceded Iqbal, but
Iqbal didn't purport to change that calculus.
Ultimately, we are still at the pleading stage.  We
believe we have pled enough facts to create a basis for
the inference of intent.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what about the other
situation, which is similar to your case but not exactly
similar -- not exactly the same.  You don't plead any
evidence of direct intent -- any direct evidence of
intent on the part of the officers, but you have two
groups.  One's pro, one's anti, and the officers put one
group one place and one group the other place.  Now, the
distance from the President to the two groups is not the
same.  One is somewhat closer, one is somewhat farther
away.  The -- the things that are in between the group
and the President are different.  Maybe in the group
that's further away, you might think the things are --
they might -- one might think that there are fewer
obstructions, maybe there are more obstructions on the
other side.  So you plead that the -- the placement of
the anti-group was less favorable than placement of the
pro-group and is that enough?
MR. WILKER:  We acknowledge that's not
enough under this Court's precedence.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What more do you need?
MR. WILKER:  We -- we do need to allege
personal participation and intent.  We understand --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you -- you plead
intent.  Would you be -- if you pled intent based just
on the disparate impact, would you be in violation of
Rule 11?
MR. WILKER:  I don't -- I don't think we'd
be in violation of Rule 11.  I don't know that under
Iqbal that that would be enough.  I think prior to
Iqbal, that would have been enough.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What more would you need?
MR. WILKER:  I think you need other evidence
from which you can infer an intent and we've pled other
evidence.  One is the time that elapsed from the time
the decision was made, which lessens the -- which
suggests and supports the inference -- supports the
inference that it wasn't a security-based determination,
but, in fact, was based on a viewpoint animus.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just to make sure,
we're talking about the 15 minutes between --
MR. WILKER:  We're talking about both.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Between when and
when?
MR. WILKER:  So we're talking about the time
the President made the decision and -- and the initial
security arrangements were made approximately at 7
o'clock.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.
MR. WILKER:  Then the President sat down at
approximately 7:15, and then another 15 minutes elapsed
before the decision is made to -- to move the anti-Bush
demonstrators.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the first --
they first cleared the alley, right?
MR. WILKER:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And then the
movement that you're concerned about.
MR. WILKER:  Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, doesn't it make
sense, just hypothetically, if you're the Secret Service
agent and you suddenly have this challenge dropped in
your lap at the last minute, you say, okay, here's the
thing, the first thing we've got to do is clear the
alley, right, because that's right up against where he's
standing.  So you take care of that.  You clear the
alley.  Then after you have more time to assess the
situation, you say, okay, now we've got to get these
people who are at the foot of the alley, we've got to
move them.
In other words, they had to act not in an
emergency situation, but reasonably quickly and they did
it step by step.
MR. WILKER:  And we understand that's the
competing inference that the government has offered
here.  We respectfully disagree that on the facts that
we've alleged that that's so compelling that it renders
our allegation implausible.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But here's where we
get back to Iqbal.  It doesn't have to be so compelling.
It simply has to be more likely, is the quote from Iqbal
on 681, and it has to be an obvious alternative
explanation.  And that's enough, no matter what you've
alleged.
MR. WILKER:  But we rely on the language
elsewhere in Iqbal, which we think has to be read
together, which is, plausibility doesn't mean
probability.  And so if -- if the contention is that if
there's a more likely explanation, ours is then --
then -- then we're being held to a probability standard
that this Court said we weren't being held to on a
pleading standard, and which we would suggest to the
Court is not consistent with Rule 8 with a short and
plain statement of the claim.  Again, we haven't had an
opportunity to develop a factual record here.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  How do you do
that?  Because I want to follow up on just what the
Chief Justice said.  Imagine that what he just said is
the real case.  You have a client, imagine, who's quite
sincere, absolutely sincere, and really feels he was
very badly treated, and you can sign a Rule 11
statement, but suppose that the facts are just what he
said.  Then suppose that Iqbal were not the law.  Forget
Iqbal for the moment.
Now, you've got my hypothetical.
MR. WILKER:  I think so.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  What weapons
does the district judge have, which I have so blithely
been assuming, to prevent a waste of time by the Secret
Service, a demoralization of the service leaning in the
direction of being overly careful and therefore risking
the President.  What procedural weapons does the present
law, absent Iqbal, give him to dispose of a case quickly
without disturbance if the true facts are what the Chief
Justice said?
MR. WILKER:  Well, I think there has to be
some opportunity to develop a factual record.  And the
trial courts have ample authority to control discovery
under the Rules of Civil Procedure.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So discovery is your
answer.  And of course it is.  You've got allegations.
You're going to go to trial.  The first thing you're
going to do is file interrogatories, you're going to
file requests for admission, you're going to file
discovery requests to the Secret Service.  And the
district court's going to have to allow some of that,
isn't he, if he's allowed your allegations to go
forward?
MR. WILKER:  I think -- I think the Court
would have to permit us to engage in some discovery of
the agents regarding are there reports of the events of
the evening?  Do they admit certain facts or deny them?
Should we have an opportunity to take brief depositions
of the agents?  And I think those are appropriate steps.
That's not full and unbridled discovery.  The rules
already limit discovery to a certain degree.  The
presumptive limits on depositions.  They --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But what about -- what
about the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The first thing
you'd want -- I say the first thing you'd want to know
is whether this was a departure from established policy.
So the first question in -- if I were drafting
interrogatories would be, what is your policy with
respect to moving demonstrators at a presidential event?
What do you do?  And I can see the Secret Service
saying, well, that's kind of a bad thing to make it
public because there are people out there who want to
kill the President, and if you go through your discovery
and say, this is how we look at that situation, this is
what we do, that gives people a -- a guideline for how
to break through the security arrangements.
MR. WILKER:  Well, the court -- the trial
courts, the district courts have -- also have ample
authority to enter protective orders.  There has been no
assertion that the information that would be required
here, and we don't know because we haven't gotten to
that stage, and I think it's premature to get to that
stage whether there would be any claims of secrecy that
would limit what we could or could not do in the context
of discovery.  But those are matters that can be best
addressed by the district court in the first instance,
and can be addressed by the normal and appropriate means
that district courts use all the time to address
sensitive information when it's presented as part of the
lawsuit in Federal court.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What -- then what does
happen if a district court does allow discovery of
things what the Secret Service thinks are confidential?
Under certain -- how far should demonstrators be away
from the President?  How high must a fence be before we
think that it provides security against a thrown object?
Suppose the district court allows discovery of all of
that.  What are they supposed to do?
They have to file a mandamus petition with
the court of appeals and get -- have the court of
appeals -- try to persuade the court of appeals to
review a discovery order?
MR. WILKER:  I think that ultimately is one
remedy and it's a remedy provided for in our system
whenever we have an issue in which sensitive information
may be involved in connection with a Federal lawsuit.
That's not -- it's not an answer to say that simply
because there might be some information that the Secret
Service would rather not share, that that should stop us
in our tracks to begin with.  Those are the kinds of
determinations that a district court should be trusted
to make in the first instance and which district judges
make every day in this country.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was -- in Judge
Berzon's opinion, she seemed to think it was very
important that when the President got into the motorcade
to leave only one side had access.  So leaving aside
what happened when the group was moved, would you take the
position that not moving them back before the President
left was a violation of their First Amendment rights?
MR. WILKER:  We have not taken that
position.  We have not asserted that they had -- that
there was an obligation to hold the President in
position so that the demonstrators could be moved back
to their former position.
Our position is they shouldn't have been
moved in the first place, because there wasn't a valid
security reason and that the reason they were moved was
solely because of the viewpoint they were expressing.
And the fact that that's not a separate claim that they
weren't moved back, but it is an indication that they
were removed from where the President would be passing,
in our view, that supports the inference of viewpoint
discrimination.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The question of mixed
motive or improper motive, if we can get back to that
for just a minute.  Assume that the law -- and this is
the Wren case -- is as follows.  If there is improper
motive for an arrest, but that there was an objective
basis that would have made the arrest and that did make
the arrest reasonable, there is no violation of the
Constitution.
Assume that's the law and forget clearly
established, forget -- assume that's the law.  It seems
to me that for you to prevail, you have to say we should
make a First Amendment exception because the First
Amendment is so important.  Or that there has to be, in
another context, an amendment for racial profiling.  So
that the rule that I have just stated has to be
qualified in some way.  It seems to me you almost have
to say that in order to prevail in this case.
MR. WILKER:  I would suggest to you that
Wren is the exception, that Wren in the Fourth Amendment
context, that says if there is an objective -- if there is
an objective basis, I think that's reflected in Reichle.
But as the Court in Iqbal noted, in the First and Fifth
Amendment context, at least in the context of State
actors, the Court has held that invidious intent is a
basis for liability.  Intent to violate those
constitutional rights is a basis, and so --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  I'm not sure.
If you stop a car because you think the participants in
it were coming back from a protest against President
Bush, is that a Fourth Amendment case or a First
Amendment case, if that's your allegation?
The only reason the car was stopped was
because of the viewpoint that these people have.  Is that a
Fourth Amendment case or a First Amendment case?
MR. WILKER:  No.  That would be a First
Amendment case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah, I would think so.
And you think that so long as you make that First
Amendment allegation, it doesn't matter if you have a
broken taillight.
MR. WILKER:  I think for the terms of the
First Amendment claim, it wouldn't matter if the
circumstances demonstrated and created a basis for that
inference of intent.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Just out of curiosity, was
there anything to prevent someone from leaving one these
groups and going over to the other group?
MR. WILKER:  There was after the President
made the decision.  The allegations in the complaint
state that the local law enforcement restricted
movements between the two groups after the security
perimeter was established.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Somebody couldn't have just
walked away and taken a circuitous route and gone to the
other group?  That would have been -- the police would
have stopped them from doing that?
MR. WILKER:  Is it theoretically possible
that they could have taken a large enough circle around
there?  I think that is a theoretical possibility.  But
the police did in fact stop movement across Third
Street.
One of the factors that we haven't addressed
today is the Secret Service's actual policy and practice
that we've alleged in our complaint.  And that plausibly
and convincingly supports the inference of intent here.
We've alleged not less than 12 other
incidents during the first 4 years of the Bush
Administration in which Secret Service agents were
involved in viewpoint suppression activities.  Now, we
haven't proven those, but again we are at the complaint
stage.
That allegation, along with the official
policy of the Bush White House to suppress dissent at
presidential appearances, also supports the inference
that these officers were acting for a viewpoint
suppressive reason.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose you would
then seek discovery with respect to those 12 other
episodes, because you're saying those are viewpoint
discrimination, how can you decide until you know the
facts of those?
MR. WILKER:  We would seek certain limited
discovery with respect to those incidents to see if they
bear out the allegations that we have made.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The same range of
things that we talked about earlier:  Interrogatories,
requests for production, discovery, with respect, not
just to your case, but to the 12 others?
MR. WILKER:  To the extent that the Secret
Service denies that those allegations or that these
officers deny those allegations in an answer, which we
haven't yet seen --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You wouldn't seek limited
discovery; you would seek unlimited discovery.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You might get only limited
discovery, but --
MR. WILKER:  I'm not sure I would seek
unlimited discovery, because then I might be
overburdened with material that would have no relevance
to the case.  What we would seek is information
sufficient to draw conclusions about those events and
whether they are sufficiently similar to support the
inference we would seek to establish in this case, that
these officers -- these agents acted with the intent weâ€™ve
alleged they acted with.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The sole.
MR. WILKER:  The sole intent.
If there are no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Gershengorn, you have 4 minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice:
A couple of points.  First, I think, Justice
Kagan, in response to your hypothetical, the concession
that in hindsight there may have been a valid security
rationale ends this case, because if it was true in
hindsight, it was certainly true at the time in the kind
of rapid -- in the kind of rapid decision-making that was
called for, as the Chief Justice alluded to.  I think at
that point the case is over in our favor.
Second, the kinds of discovery that
my friend on the other side --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I just clarify a
factual matter.  There are two alleyways.  There was one
on Third Street that the President went into, and then
there is one by the patio dining room.  What access was
there between Fourth Street and the patio?  Because I
thought that the alley was on California Street, the
entrance to the alley was on California Street.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  The entry to the alley is
on California Street.  That's the one where the
anti-Bush demonstrators were.  The alley that the
motorcade went through, which is on Third Street, which
is neither -- neither group of protesters could get to because
the police had blocked off traffic north of California
Street so that -- no protests, no demonstrators could
get there at all.
If I could return on the discovery point.
The discovery that my colleague has suggested he would
seek is exactly the nightmare scenario that the Secret
Service fears.  It's exactly what qualified immunity is
designed to prevent.  When there is a legitimate
security rationale, discovery into what the agents were
thinking, what the Secret Service's policies were is
exactly what there shouldn't be.  It's exactly what the
Court said in Hunter that it didn't want, which is
agents hesitating before they did their job.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Gershengorn, suppose
it's originally set up by the police, the motorcade is
coming down, each side has roughly equal access.  Then the
Secret Service comes along and said:  Clear the
anti-Bush demonstrators.  Suppose that, that -- those
were the facts.  Would there be a valid Bivens claim?
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, the question
would depend on whether there was a valid security
rationale.  I think in the context of a motorcade --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The rationale is just it's
more likely that the people who are against the
President would be harmful to him than the people who
are for him.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I think that
would be a much more difficult case in the context of a
motorcade where the security of the President is much
different than when the President is on an outdoor patio
separated only by a small fence.  And I do think that
that is one of the major differences between where
the -- the treatment of the pro-Bush protesters and the
anti-Bush protesters here is that the -- an allegation
that could be based on differential treatment because
the pro-Bush protesters were in position to see the
motorcade when it left, and therefore, as the complaint
alleges in Paragraph 55, that that somehow undermines
the agents' security rationale for moving the anti-Bush
protesters during the meal, it just doesn't wash.
And then if I could turn just very quickly,
Justice Breyer, to your suggestion that the district
court could -- could control discovery.  That's exactly
what the Court rejected in Twombly, exactly what the
Court rejected in Iqbal.  As a practical matter, once
that door is open, the agents lose the security and
peace of mind that they need and they're subjected to
the very burdens they shouldn't be subjected to.
And then if I could just close with a quick
point on the Iqbal.  We don't think under the
allegations here, as the Chief Justice pointed to the
key passage in Iqbal, that these allegations are any
more than consistent with the obvious alternative
explanation.
I've addressed the pro-Bush protesters.  The
diners are very differently situated for a security
perspective because they had no anticipation of seeing
the President, and the Secret Service could screen
additional folks coming in.  It's very different from a
crowd outside an alleyway.
The advance manual that the other side
points to supports us, not them.  What it said is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish your
sentence.
MR. GERSHENGORN:  What it says, Your Honor,
is that security concerns are for the Secret Service.
If it's a political concern, that's for the advance
team.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Counsel.
The case is submitted.
