Mr. Phillips, whenever you're ready we will be

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice Stevens,
and may it please the Court:
Six years ago, this Court in Buckman
recognized that policing fraud against Federal agencies
is hardly a field the states have traditionally
occupied. Based on that premise, this Court in Buckman
struck down a novel State tort that was based on the
whole concept of fraud on the FDA.
And the Court concluded that that tortious
analysis as a matter of State law would inevitably
conflict with the FDA's responsibility to police fraud.
A responsibility that the Court recognized was
essentially cradle to grave covered by Federal law. It
arises out of Federal law, it is regulated by Federal
law and it is ultimately terminated by Federal law.
Michigan has adopted a unique product
liability statute, and on the one hand confers a very
broad immunity of defense against all product liability
claims for manufacturers who comply with the FDA's
requirements.
But then on the other hand, withdraws that
immunity for the defense, this is PDA App. 42A, if the
manufacturer intentionally withholds from or
misrepresents to the United States Food and Drug
Administration information concerning the drug that is
required to be submitted pursuant to -- and then it goes
and lists very specific provisions of the Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act -- and the drug would not have been
approved or the Food and Drug Administration would have
withdrawn approval.
It is difficult for me to imagine a statute
that would more consciously and openly tread into
exactly the same territory that this Court declared in
Buckman as a matter of exclusive Federal and concern not
available to the states to regulate.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, what if the
statute didn't have that provision, but it just said you
can bring a State tort action when the conditions
approved by the FDA for the marketing of this drug have
not been complied with? That's all it says. Now, would
you knowledge that that -- that that suit could be
brought?
MR. PHILLIPS: I will acknowledge that's a
fundamentally different issue, Justice Scalia, because
there you are talking about what duties are owed to the
public that are enforced by the FDA and potentially are
enforceable by the states as well.
But here we're talking about duties that are
owed from the manufacturer exclusively --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a duty that is defined
by the FDA. And I didn't hear your answer. Would that
suit be allowable or not?
MR. PHILLIPS: That suit would not be
barred, I don't think, by Buckman. I think the question
there will really go to what the Court is going to
decide next term in Wyeth as to how far when if you have
FDA approval of certain activities that that has the
effect of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't seem to me --
what I worry about is that if we say in this case it
treads too much into the FDA's own responsibility to say
what material should have been provided to the FDA, it
seems to me the next what could be more central to the
FDA -- to the FDA's job than determining whether the
conditions the FDA prescribed for the marketing of the
drug have indeed been observed? That's central as well.
MR. PHILLIPS: I don't think it is an
unreasonable next step, but it is clearly the next step
that has to be taken. Because what this Court decided
in Buckman -- and it's central and candidly we are here
seeking a very narrow ruling from the Court is that when
you're defining the relationship between the
manufacturer and the seller of the drugs and the FDA in
terms of the disclosure of information to that entity
and the determination both whether that information is
adequate to allow the agency to perform its business and
then, more fundamentally, whether or not the agency is
acting in accordance with its own exclusive authority to
decide how to proceed --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But one can also reason in
the opposite direction; that is to say, one can know
from the medical devices portion of the FDA that
Congress has no objection to private tort actions
that -- where the medical device manufacturer has not
observed the requirements that the FDA's approval
impose, right? We know from that section that Congress
has no objection to that there.
You can probably guess that Congress has no
objection to it in the -- in the drug field as well as
the medical devices field. And if I make that guess,
what is so different about having a jury second-guess
the provision of information portion?
MR. PHILLIPS: It seems to me that the same
argument you just made, Justice Scalia, would have led
the Court to the opposite result in Buckman, because
what's the -- you know, if Congress didn't care about
allowing State tort law to be -- to serve as the
enforcement mechanism, then why wouldn't you allow them
to do that in that context as well?
And this Court said the reason is because
there is a very uniquely Federal interest in taking care
of the business and the relationship between those two
entities.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, It is -- it is more
of a stick in the eye of the Federal Government to
create a cause of action that consists of defrauding the
Federal Government, which is what was at issue in
Buckman. The very cause of action was providing false
information to the FDA. Here the cause of action is a
standard tort cause of action for marketing a defective
product.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, when you say "here"
what we're talking -- what we're talking about here is a
very unique State statute that is the sole basis on
which the tort liability is set aside.
We're not -- we're not pre-empting the
underlying tort claims by the Federal law that's at
issue in this case. The State statute pre-empts the
common law court claims. That first portion of the
defense wipes those out. So it's not pre-emption of the
traditional State law cause of action, as the Second
Circuit wrongly evaluated it. What we're talking about
here is a provision that in the most exquisite terms
says: Allow the State, either by the court or the
juries, to evaluate the adequacy of the information that
the FDA required.
And it's important to understand how that
plays out, because what it says is pursuant to those
statutes. It specifically identifies provisions in the
statutes. It doesn't say anything about how the FDA --
how the FDA interprets those statutes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, isn't --
isn't the standard -- in the standard tort claim, no
Michigan statute, but a defense that's available to a
drug manufacturer who is charged with putting on the
market a defective drug, its regulatory compliance,
right?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so the State of
Michigan has said: Drug dealers -- I'm sorry -- drug
sellers --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- drug manufacturers, we
are going to give you an invigorated defense. Instead
of just saying you show regulatory compliance, we're
going to take you off the hook altogether, except if you
didn't come clean with the FDA, if you withheld
information or misrepresented information.
It seems to me that what -- you could say
this is just like Buckman, but you could also say this
is giving the manufacturer an invigorated regulatory
compliance defense.
So why shouldn't it be looked at as the
second, rather than the first?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what you're
basically arguing for is an argument I think one of the
amici made on the other side, which is: Does the
greater power include the lesser power? That is, if we
had the authority not to give you a defense in the first
place, don't we have the authority to use this as a
lever in order to allow us essentially to undertake to
regulate in precisely the same way the FDA would?
And the answer is: No, because this is not
a situation --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're arguing an
unconstitutional condition, in effect.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think it is an
unconstitutional condition. But I think the bottom line
is it's not a question of us taking the bad with the
good. The problem here is that the Federal Government
has an independent interest, and it is the Federal
Government's independent interest that is being
essentially wiped away.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you're right in your
argument, the Michigan statute provided two things: One
good for the manufacturer, immunity; two, a
qualification on it. It seems to me that those two
can't be unstuck. So to strike out one, as was done in
the Sixth Circuit case, and not the other is certainly
not faithful to the Michigan legislature that put these
two things together.
MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, that's
clearly a question of State law. I mean, that's a
severability issue to be sure. And I -- but I think
it's not fair to condemn the way the Sixth Circuit
analyzed this case.
What the Sixth Circuit said is if it's still
available to the State to come in after the FDA has both
found that there has been a material deception of one
sort or another and that the FDA has decided to withdraw
the product as a consequence of that, and that -- and
then State law is allowed to come in and enforce product
liability claims under those circumstances, that the
legislature would have been perfectly satisfied with
that arrangement.
And, candidly, that is precisely what we
have asked for before both the Second Circuit and this
Court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, May I ask
this question that's related to Justice Ginsburg's, but
not the same. You are saying that the defense is not
pre-empted; the response to the defense is what is
pre-empted here.
MR. PHILLIPS: Correct.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What if you didn't have a
statute at all and you just had a common law lawsuit in
which you defended on the ground of compliance with the
Federal statute shows, the Federal program, shows a lack
of negligence. And then it then came back with the
rebuttal: Yes, but your compliance was tainted by
fraud, the same kind of thing. Would that response be
pre-empted in a common law lawsuit?
MR. PHILLIPS: I think the question goes to
how far that response goes. If you in fact instructed,
if the trial judge instructed the jury that if it found,
and then just quoted the language of the statute that
there's no, then I'd say, yes, that is pre-empted in
precisely the same way.
And the language the Court used in Buckman
was "critical element." If the FDA's regulatory
authority is a critical element of the case, then, yes,
it is pre-empted.
Whether or not -- whether evidence by itself
would be a critical element is harder to tell.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just finish with
one other thought before --
MR. PHILLIPS: Sure.
JUSTICE STEVENS: In one of your arguments
and the government's argument, this is very burdensome
to the FDA because we have all this litigation. In all
the years we have had this kind of tort litigation, has
this issue ever proved to be burdensome to the
government in any of these -- these attempts to make out
this charge and this defense?
MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, the government is
probably in a better position to evaluate that than I
am. But, you know --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Because It seems to me
that we have three or four States that have these
statutes.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But most States don't have
these statutes. I wonder if the problem is really as
serious as everybody --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what the Court
said in Buckman about that probably applies equally
here, which is that, rather than look to see whether
there is, in fact, going to be an interference, we ought
to recognize that this is a territory that is locked off
exclusively to the Federal Government's control, and we
shouldn't -- and there shouldn't be that external pull,
the extraneous pull, that State law provides under these
circumstances.
And the same logic obviously applied here
would say: We don't wait until there's a serious
interference with how the FDA is trying to do its job;
we try to prevent that because there's no -- there's no
legitimate State interest to be served here.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think there can
also be the same argument for pre-empting the section,
the subpart (b) of Michigan statute, the bribery
exception?
MR. PHILLIPS: No. I think there's a
difference between the bribery statute, because again
that doesn't go to the direct relationship between the
manufacturer or the seller or the regulated entity and
the FDA itself. That goes to the relationship
between -- that -- that is governed by a different set
of laws.
And I think it's traditionally been the case
that States are in fact entitled to enforce laws against
bribery of Federal officials. So I don't think the same
-- as I say, what I'm looking for here is an extremely
narrow ruling from this Court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the defense
itself, which says that the defense is available if not
only the drug was approved for safety and efficacy, but
also if the drug and its labeling were in compliance
with the FDA's approval at the time the drug left the
control of the manufacturer?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it wrong to say that
that's -- you know, that that's interfering with the
FDA's bailiwick?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think when the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to let a jury
decide that?
MR. PHILLIPS: No, I'm not going to let a
jury decide that.
(Laughter.)
MR. PHILLIPS: What the district court found
here, obviously, was that there was compliance, because
the other side didn't challenge the compliance.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Uh-huh.
MR. PHILLIPS: And, candidly, I think that
is going to happen 99.999 percent of the time, because
that's not going to be the issue.
But, you know, could it eventually be a
problem if a State jury -- if a State court were to
decide that there hasn't been compliance? It seems to
me that's much closer, again, to what you're going to
take up again next term in Wyeth.
I think that is a legitimate issue, but it's
a very different one from the question of how do you
regulate the relationship between a -- the regulated
entity and the FDA in terms of the information flow that
goes between those two entities.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me what you
are saying is: We're going to win this case even if
there were no pre-emption.
MR. PHILLIPS: Even if there is no
pre-emption on -- on the -- well, I hope I win this case
regardless.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Because they have such a
burden of proving that the drug wouldn't, in fact, have
been withdrawn and so forth.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, well -- you mean I
would have won this case on the merits of it?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, clearly we know
that the FDA didn't withdrew this as a consequence of
fraud. So in that sense, I suppose you're right, but --
but the reality is that the more fundamental problem
remains, whether or not these kinds of statutes are
still out there, are going to create this -- as the
Court said -- extraneous pull.
JUSTICE BREYER: Let's just say you use
something like primary jurisdiction said that they
actually have to -- to withdraw it. Now, if the FDA --
this is what Justice Stevens said in his concurring
opinion, which I thought had a lot to be said for it --
that if you had a system where the FDA did withdraw it
and found fraud, you could ask them, and then nothing
wrong with the plaintiff going ahead there.
MR. PHILLIPS: We don't have any problem
with that, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: You don't have any problem.
MR. PHILLIPS: No, we were very --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's not --
MR. PHILLIPS: If the Court wanted to go
that way, that's fine. I don't think it's presented in
this case, but that wouldn't present any problem for us.
I think what we -- what we have here is the Second
Circuit is wrong, and the judgment should be reversed.
Thank you, Your Honors.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
Mr. Joseffer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. JOSEFFER: Justice Stevens, and may it
please the Court:
The Michigan statute presents the same
conflict this Court found in Buckman, because it
requires the determination of fraud on the FDA as a
necessary predicate for establishing liability. And as
this Court explained in Buckman, the relationship
between a Federal agency and the entities it regulates
is inherently Federal. And that's --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Does your argument carry to
the point of the same argument when regulatory
compliance is raised as a defense, or regulatory
violation is raised as a ground for liability?
MR. JOSEFFER: It could depend, because in
our view what's pre-empted here is a State court
determination -- under Buckman, what's pre-empted is a
State court determination of whether the FDA was
defrauded as part of FDA's approval process. So, for
example, under any circumstance, if a jury is being
instructed to find whether FDA was defrauded as part of
the approval process, we'd say there's pre-emption.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, whenever you --
whenever you raise FDA compliance, there is at least the
potential for a response that they -- they defrauded the
FDA; they didn't tell them what they should have, and --
you know, vice versa, when -- when it's raised on the
other side.
So you always have the potential there for
-- for just what concerns you, don't you?
MR. JOSEFFER: Well -- and what we would say
is not pre-empted -- I mean, it's hard to analyze this
in the abstract without a record as to what a jury was
actually being asked to do. But if you had a situation
where it was, say, a design defect claim, and the jury
was being asked to decide whether this design is
defective, and that's what it's looking at, and in
connection with that the jury is instructed that two
relevant things it can consider are, first, the fact of
FDA's approval determination and, second, the
circumstances surrounding that approval determination,
then that by itself, we would say, is not pre-empted by
Buckman, really for two reasons. One is that
pre-emption normally applies to legal theories, such as
claims or defenses, not the mere admissibility of
evidence; and the second is that FDA's core prerogatives
here, as the administrator of its own drug approval
process, are to determine whether it has been defrauded
and what to do about that. And if the jury is not being
asked to find those things, but instead is just
considering evidence in connection with something else,
we would say that that is what's not pre-empted.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's the withdrawal
element, withdrawal of approval that kills it here?
MR. JOSEFFER: That's part of it but not all
of it. I mean, in our view, FDA, as the administrator
of its own approval process, needs absolute discretion
to determine what must be submitted to it as part of its
own approval process, whether it is misled as part of
its own approval process; whether as you said it would
have made a different determination in the absence of
any fraud.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But if you get beyond the
element of what the FDA would have done if it had known,
then it seems to me you get into an issue which is
likely to arise by -- whenever, by one side or the
other, the question of regulatory approval is -- is
offered as a mere matter of evidence.
MR. JOSEFFER: Well, if it really is a mere
matter of evidence, and that's not what the jury is be
asked to find -- and by the way, it's not at all clear
that there's -- that there's -- it's settled common law
tradition in this type of litigation, because the
context here, where a Federal agency does a
product-specific approval based in part on a submission
of information from a manufacturer, that's not a --
that's a question that, first, is of relatively modern
vintage and, second, is not terribly common. So there's
not really a uniform, deeply rooted common law tradition
here. But if all we were talking about was the mere
admissibility of evidence, we would agree that that was
not pre-empted. But if you look at --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that's what you've
got here, except that the mere admissibility of the
evidence turns in part on what the -- the FDA would have
done.
MR. JOSEFFER: Well, no --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But essentially -- I mean
you -- the fact is the evidence of the FDA approval is
made admissible and conclusive, and whether that in fact
may be admitted is subject to the -- what is it --
clause (b) that you object to, but it comes down to a
question of admissibility.
MR. JOSEFFER: Well, it's not because the
statute expressly requires, as a predicate for
liability, a finding that the information disclosure
requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
were violated. The jury has to find what was required
to be submitted to FDA, was it submitted to FDA and was
FDA misled? And if you had a State administrative
agency that was set up to tell companies what they must
or must not submit to FDA, as part of FDA's own approval
process, the conflict with FDA's ability to administer
its own approval process would be manifest. And it's no
different -- as in Regal, the juries instead of agencies
would be making those determinations in individual
cases.
And if I could illustrate the concern which
this Court explained in Buckman, it's that -- just two
FDA regulations. The first explains that the technical
section of a new drug application must provide
information and data in sufficient detail to permit the
agency to make a knowledgeable judgment. Now, because
that is an extremely subjective standard, another FDA
regulation -- and by the way, these are on pages 142a
and 186a of the petition appendix -- the second goes on
to explain that the type and quantity of information
that must be submitted to FDA necessarily depends on the
particular drug.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this sort of
general question? Apart from Buckman itself, which
describes a very serious theoretical problem, as I
understand it, there must have been a fair amount of
litigation over the years where the regulatory
compliance defense was raised or challenged or so forth.
Is there -- are there any reported cases describing the
magnitude of the problem to the government, when the --
as the result of debate about these issues?
MR. JOSEFFER: Nothing that -- that that's
beyond the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The whole theoretical
problem.
MR. JOSEFFER: Well, it's also a relatively
new problem, and what -- because -- because it's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The litigation is not, not
new.
MR. JOSEFFER: Right, but the
product-specific approvals, and the desire to probe into
the circumstances surrounding a product-specific
approval, is of relatively modern vintage. And Buckman
itself stands for the proposition that that was not a
traditional State inquiry at that time. And Buckman
certainly has not encouraged a significant increase in
such litigation since then. So this is something that
there's not been a whole lot of.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Leaving aside Buckman,
what's your strongest case in support of your position?
Besides that it is a new problem.
MR. JOSEFFER: Well, it is. It's a novel
type of situation where you're -- where you're talking
about the Federal Government's prerogatives to
administer its own approval processes. There hasn't
been a lot of State court litigation on this, in part
because it's so obviously a Federal matter. I mean, if
a State supreme court wanted to tell litigants, private
litigants before this Court what they could and couldn't
say in their briefs to this Court, the conflict would be
obvious and therefore the State supreme court would
never do it. And you have a similar problem here where
the State is essentially telling companies what they
must or must not be telling FDA, and there's just an
obvious intrusion there with FDA's ability to administer
its own approval process.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Joseffer, let's
assume that -- that you're right. The Second Circuit,
because it thought your position it was wrong, never got
to the severance question. It had been decided by some
intermediate appellate court. But would it not be
appropriate then to leave it to the Second Circuit on
remand, if it chooses to use the Michigan certification
process to say, well, we want to find out from the
Michigan Supreme Court whether they think that the sweet
stays, but the bitter goes?
MR. JOSEFFER: Right. And, I mean, as you
know, we don't have a position on the State law
severability question, because our concern here is
protecting FDA's prerogative to administer its own
process, not with whether the plaintiff or defendant
ultimately wins.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It was decided by the Sixth
Circuit, wasn't it?
MR. JOSEFFER: It was. And one of the
things that that brings up, in the Sixth Circuit it was
actually the plaintiff who was advocating Federal
pre-emption there, because she thought that she would
then win on severability analysis and would thereby
knock out the entire State statute. What that
underscores is that the unusual Federal pre-emption
question here is not necessarily one that is even bad
for plaintiffs. It just protects the important Federal
prerogative of FDA's ability to administer its own drug
approval process.
But -- but to answer your question, I mean,
we don't have a question -- a position on that analysis,
but I mean, among the procedural options that are
available, as you said, I mean, you're right. Michigan
does have a State certification process that, if people
thought appropriate, could be used.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: This -- this tracks
somewhat Justice Stevens' question. Do we know in this
case, would this have taken two or three days of
testimony? Was there discovery? Was it a thousand
documents? Or three documents?
MR. JOSEFFER: Right. I mean, this case was
resolved promptly on a motion to dismiss. But if you
were going to seriously litigate the question, you would
have to know -- in order to put this in context, to
determine things like withholding and materiality --
you'd have to know everything that FDA had before it,
what FDA thought was required as part of that process.
You would then have to, I suppose, depose FDA witnesses
as to what they would have found to be misleading and
what decisions they might have made in hypothetical
circumstances.
And those are incredibly intrusive inquiries
that, one, distort manufacturers' incentives in dealing
with FDA in the first place; two, if this was seriously
going to be litigated would require, I assume, quite a
lot of discovery from FDA, which we would resist, but
that's not to say that we would necessarily succeed in
our objections.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask would you -- is
the bribery exception also pre-empted, do you think?
MR. JOSEFFER: That's a -- there's a very
different analysis there.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand. Do you
think --
MR. JOSEFFER: But we do think that that
would be pre-empted because -- for a slightly different
reason, which is that the relationship between -- the
bribery of a Federal official in connection with his
Federal duties is obviously a matter of paramount
Federal concern, and when the -- especially when the
State is looking at that for purposes of essentially
second-guessing the validity of a regulatory
determination that FDA had made --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing the -- supposing
the official pleaded guilty to bribery. Would it be
pre-empted then?
MR. JOSEFFER: Obviously, it still gets much
closer, and at that point, I'm not sure that it would
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me we've got a
lot of theoretical litigation out here without much
actual experience with any of these cases.
MR. JOSEFFER: You know, what I was going to
say is there are a lot of interesting issues surrounding
this case, but none of them actually seem to be
presented in this case, because here -- I mean, the
statute clearly requires a determination of fraud on the
FDA, including all the elements I mentioned, as a
necessary predicate for recovery; and, two, FDA has not
made such a determination.
Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you very much.
Ms. Zieve.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. ZIEVE: Justice Stevens, and may it
please the Court:
Warner-Lambert marketed a defective product.
It withheld information about the injury the product
could cause, and the product caused injury to a great
many patients, including Respondents. They sued
Warner-Lambert alleging traditional State law claims,
such as product defect and failure to warn. I'd like
to begin by explaining why the misrepresentation
exception to the Michigan defense does not implicate the
concerns that were raised by the Court in Buckman.
Specifically, the Court in Buckman identified three
problems or concerns that it thought warranted
pre-emption in that case: That the claim alleged would
cause companies to submit too much information and slow
down the 510(k) process; that the claim alleged might
cause companies not to submit products for approval
because of concern about off-label use; and that the
claim would cause an unwarranted intrusion on the FDA's
decisionmaking about how to police and enforce fraud
against it.
So the question is: Does the Michigan law
implicate these three concerns any more than traditional
State tort litigation against a drug company?
I'll start with what I think are the easy
ones. For three reasons, the Michigan statute creates
no incentive for manufacturers to submit unnecessary
information to the FDA. Unlike the streamlined 510(k)
clearance process that was at issue in Buckman, in this
case we have a drug approval. Drugs are required to go
through a comprehensive pre-market approval process.
The regulations require submission of, "all available
information about the safety of a drug, including
demonstrated or potential adverse effects." I was
quoting from 314.50(b)(5). As Warner-Lambert points out
in its brief, a typical new drug application can be
thousands of pages long. So there's not really -- not
only is there not evidence that this 12-year-old statute
will lead companies to submit information that the FDA
doesn't want and doesn't need; but it's really unclear
what such evidence would be because, after all,
companies are required to submit all safety information
to the FDA, and it's safety information that would be
relevant to a finding under the Michigan exception.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The converse of that is
that the discovery is exhaustive and quite burdensome.
I mean, you're trying to say, well, don't worry; there's
thousands of documents here; they won't be submitting
anything else. But, on the other hand, that cuts
against you when we're talking about the intrusiveness
on the Federal scheme because you have to have Federal
regulators go back through all of this stuff again.
MS. ZIEVE: No, Your Honor. The discovery
in a case like this -- there is no evidence to suggest
it would be any broader or more burdensome than
discovery in a typical product liability case against a
drug company.
In that regard, Mr. Joseffer is wrong that
there was no discovery in this case. These cases are
part of a multidistrict litigation and there was a
significant amount of discovery.
JUSTICE BREYER: All that makes -- makes it
worse, in a sense, because what you're saying to me
anyway -- and you can explain why I'm not right -- that
all of the three things that you mentioned are only
aspects of something much more fundamental that
underlies all these cases -- Medtronics, drugs, all of
them. You came up and began and said this drug has side
effects that hurt people. And that's a risk when you
have a drug, and it's a terrible thing if the drug hurts
people.
There's a risk on the other side. There are
people who are dying or seriously sick, and if you don't
get the drug to them they die. So there's a problem.
You've got to get drugs to people and at the same time
the drug can't hurt them.
Now, who would you rather have make the
decision as to whether this drug is, on balance, going
to save people or, on balance, going to hurt people? An
expert agency, on the one hand, or 12 people pulled
randomly for a jury role who see before them only the
people whom the drug hurt and don't see those who need
the drug to cure them?
Now, that it seems to me is Congress's
fundamental choice, and Congress has opted for the
agency. And that's why we're here --
MS. ZIEVE: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- because you want the
jury to do it. And it seems to me, reading Buckman,
that Buckman says the agency should do it. So that's
what underlies all my reactions to this, and I might as
well get it right out so that you can answer.
MS. ZIEVE: Well, I think I have a -- State
law torts suits aren't seeking to make a determination
about whether the product should have gone on the
market. The purpose of the State law tort suit is to
compensate injured patients. That's a fundamentally
different role. It's complementary to the FDA's role,
but it's different. And I think your question, though,
really goes more to the broader issues that the Court
will consider next term.
JUSTICE BREYER: Ms. Zieve, it doesn't
object to a system where the -- a court -- the State
would come in and give you your tort suit if it's really
true that the agency would withdraw this drug. But what
you want is to be able to convince the jury that there
was fraud in a situation where the agency doesn't say
there was fraud. So what you're doing is removing a
drug from the market that they want out there.
Now, that's the theory of Buckman. The
theory of Buckman is --
MS. ZIEVE: But that is not --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- they want to save people
whom you say they shouldn't because the drug shouldn't
be there. I overstate it slightly. So, explain to me
why.
MS. ZIEVE: Well, this case doesn't seek to
pull Rezulin from the market. Well, first of all,
Rezulin was pulled from the market seven years ago. But
that is not the goal of this case. The goal of this
case is to pay -- to get compensation for people who
suffered serious liver damage, every single one of them.
About a third of the patient-respondents died from the
liver damage caused by Rezulin, and what they're seeking
here is not a regulatory remedy; they're seeking damages
and compensation for that.
And the -- the place where we started with
the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your premise still is, is
that the drug should not have been marketed, or is that
your premise?
MS. ZIEVE: Well, under Michigan law, the
plaintiffs can only --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know your purpose is
different, but the premise on which you operate is that
the drug should not have been sold.
MS. ZIEVE: The -- if I can just back up to
-- to the structure of the Michigan statute --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can back up as long as
you want as long as you come forward and answer.
(Laughter.)
MS. ZIEVE: I promise will.
(Laughter.)
MS. ZIEVE: The Michigan statute takes as
its starting point the notion that Federal approval is
reliable evidence that a drug company has satisfied the
duty -- State law duties of care owed to patients, and
then it says: But there are a couple of situations
where that reliability is drawn into question.
So, if the company bribes the FDA or the if
the company misrepresented important information to the
FDA, then the approval is no longer a sufficient basis
on which we can just say that approval in and of itself
means that the manufacturer satisfied State law duties.
And so, the -- the purpose of the finding
about whether there was misrepresentation and what the
results of it might have been is not to police
enforcement with FDA requirements, and it is not to
force the drug off the market. It is only a hurdle that
the plaintiff has to get past so it can litigate -- he
or she can litigate her State law claim the same way
plaintiffs will be litigating those claims, and did
litigate those claims, with respect to Rezulin in States
across the country.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Aren't you going to tell
this jury that the drug should not have been on the
market?
MS. ZIEVE: Yes. In Michigan they will have
to present evidence that if the company had been honest
with the FDA, the product wouldn't have been approved.
The discovery in this case shows that it doesn't -- at
least in this case, that wouldn't present a big problem.
First of all, there is evidence in this
case, testimony from the medical officer who reviewed
the information, that Rezulin would not have been
approved as a standalone therapy, that it is infused
without insulin or another drug, if the company hadn't
lied about -- withheld adverse event reports.
But certainly in the typical case a lot of
the information that comes out with respect to what went
on before the FDA, not only is it submitted in product
liability cases in the first instance by the
manufacturer to show all of the hurdles they had to go
through to get on the market, doesn't that show our
product was safe, but a lot of it you can get in
discovery from the company, themselves, as happened in
this case. A lot of --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought under the
Michigan scheme you don't have to show that. You just
show approval, and that's the end of the case in
Michigan.
MS. ZIEVE: There are no Michigan cases
explaining just what you need to show to satisfy the
defense, so it is unclear whether you have to show that
you met -- if it is the right chemical formula, with the
label originally approved, or does compliance with
approval mean that you also had to show -- one of the
terms of approval is that you continued to update your
label when you become aware of new safety information;
would you have to show -- a manufacturer have to show
that to show that the defense was satisfied.
There's no cases under Michigan law which
tell us --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that you
could prove that the -- an exception to the defense
applies and still lose your lawsuit?
MS. ZIEVE: Absolutely, we could. Showing
that the exception applies is just the first step to
being able to litigate this case the way plaintiffs
litigated these cases in California, and Illinois, and
New York, and other States.
There was Rezulin litigation throughout the
country. And, again, the point about discovery is that
the broad discovery that was done, a lot from
Warner-Lambert, some from the FDA, that was no different
discovery really than would be required under Michigan.
It's all there.
JUSTICE ALITO: Would you explain why you
think Mr. Joseffer was wrong when he argued that having
a jury decide whether the FDA would have approved the
drug or would have withdrawn it from the market if
additional or different information had been supplied is
incorrect?
Doesn't that -- wouldn't that very seriously
interfere with what the FDA is doing?
MS. ZIEVE: Well, of course, in the specific
facts of this case it wouldn't, because Rezulin is off
the market and unapproved. But even as a general matter
it doesn't affect FDA's regulation because, as I said in
response to Justice Stevens, the effect of making that
showing and the jury agreeing that the product wouldn't
have been approved is -- there's no regulatory effect.
The effect is that the plaintiff can then go ahead and
litigate her case like she could in any other State.
And that's why -- that's because what
Michigan is doing is not policing enforcement. It is
just defining the parameters of the compliance --
JUSTICE ALITO: There wouldn't be discovery
of internal processes within the FDA? There wouldn't be
experts testifying about what the FDA would or would not
have done?
MS. ZIEVE: Well, the parties may seek
discovery. There hasn't been enough Michigan litigation
for us to know exactly how it would work; but,
certainly, the courts in Michigan should be trusted to
use their discretion to keep discovery under control as
they do in every case. The Rezulin litigation --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't -- in this case
one of the charges was that the original FDA examiner
had recommended against approval for this drug, and then
something happened inside the FDA, and that examiner was
taken off the matter, and another one who approved it
was put on?
Isn't that the kind of thing that the FDA
would want to police itself and not have State courts
look into?
MS. ZIEVE: Well, those are some of the
background facts that happened here. But I don't think
those are the facts that go to a showing of what the FDA
would have done if Warner-Lambert had made honest
disclosures, because actually those facts tend to
suggest that the FDA did know what was going on.
But later the second medical officer, the
one who did recommend approval -- the approval came in
two stages. One was for use as a combination therapy
with insulin and another drug called Metformin, and
later there was an approval for use of Rezulin on its
own.
That is the use that happened to affect all
of my clients, and that's the use where we already have
a medical officer who testified that the agency would
not have approved for that use if the company hadn't
withheld safety information.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what evidence would
you introduce to prove the -- to prove the exception if
the Second Circuit's decision stands?
MS. ZIEVE: Deposition testimony from that
medical officer, for example. There are e-mails. We
cited a couple of e-mails in the red brief of things
that were stated at the time: One an e-mail to
Warner-Lambert and one from a medical officer to his
superior talking about the way in which Warner-Lambert
made it harder -- to be kind to -- for them to assess
what the true safety profile of the drug was.
There is -- as I said, there was a very
large amount of Rezulin discovery done in the MDL, most
of which is under a protective order. So I don't know
everything that's in there, but --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is: Would
we be disrupting the FDA by taking depositions of
examiners to find out what went on at the FDA?
MS. ZIEVE: No more so than product
liability litigation in any other State. As I said, the
deposition that happened in this case, the plaintiff's
committee asked -- they negotiated discovery with the
FDA in the Rezulin cases in general, not looking at
Michigan specifically at all. They got some discovery
from the FDA and the deposition of the medical officer.
There's also a lot of information about
approved drugs that the FDA posts as a matter of course
on its website, including the medical officer reviews
that form the basis for the approval decision.
But even in other cases, for instance, the
Vioxx MDL that was pending in Louisiana, the -- in that
case the FDA wasn't as interested in negotiating, and
there was motions to suppress and a motion to compel.
And the judge had to decide whether to allow an FDA
medical officer to be deposed; and in that case, did.
There are other cases where the FDA has not
wanted discovery and has successfully opposed it. The
FDA has regulations about that, and there's no evidence
that it's burdening the FDA to cooperate to some degree
in discovery or the judges are allowing plaintiffs to
overrun the FDA with requests they can't handle. But,
more importantly --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume -- I assume -- you
don't stop between sentences, so I hate to interrupt
you.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that if this drug
were still on the market, you could bring forward the
information that you have alluded to about the
withholding of necessary data by Warner-Lambert, and the
FDA would certainly be able to consider that and decide
whether sanctions were necessary, withdrawing of the
drug was necessary.
In this case, the drug has already been
withdrawn. So I assume the FDA has at least a reduced
incentive to go into these questions. I guess they
still would want to go into them if Warner-Lambert were
really a bad actor. They could impose some sanctions,
couldn't they, even though the drug was already
withdrawn?
MS. ZIEVE: I don't know if they still
could, but presumably sometime in the past they could
have.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think we could have
two different rules: One for drugs that are still out
there and one for drugs that have since been withdrawn?
Because I frankly see little incentive for the FDA, you
know, to go back over past mistakes. The drug now
having been withdrawn, it doesn't matter.
But if the drug was still out there, it
seems to me you could come forward, and I would be much
less sympathetic to what you're trying to do. You could
trust the FDA to do the job.
MS. ZIEVE: Well, the job the FDA is going
to do, even if it agrees with a plaintiff, is to
sanction the company, perhaps, or to ask it for
different information. It does have the ability to
withdraw approval --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but once it sanctions
the Plaintiff, the Government can't make the argument
you are interfering; you are second-guessing the FDA.
The FDA would have said: You didn't give us
information that was necessary; and had we known this,
we wouldn't have gone ahead.
MS. ZIEVE: There's no way for a plaintiff
to compel the FDA to look into a situation of a
manufacturer being dishonest for the -- or to -- even if
the FDA starts a process for a plaintiff to compel the
agency to make a finding that the company
withheld material information, and we would not have
approved it otherwise.
And even if the agency chose to do that, it
wouldn't be of any help to the plaintiff because the
plaintiff's family is seeking compensation because the
breadwinner is dead, or the person is impeded in their
ability to make a living in the future and has huge
medical bills now.
And the FDA's finding that, yes, the company
really acted badly isn't going to do anything to help
that -- that family.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but it will lead to
the drug being withdrawn, in which case there may be
just as many people on the other side who are dying,
dead, no breadwinner, et cetera, because they didn't get
a necessary drug. And that's why what worries me is
what happens if the jury is wrong?
You are absolutely right when you say you
cannot make the FDA go into this matter and withdraw a
drug; and they are absolutely right when they say we
cannot promise you that juries will be right.
MS. ZIEVE: But, again --
JUSTICE BREYER: So the the question is:
Who is more likely to be right?
MS. ZIEVE: With respect, I don't think
that's the question, because if the jury -- if a
Michigan jury is wrong about what would have happened if
Warner-Lambert hadn't acted so badly, the result is that
Ms. Kent and the other Plaintiffs get to litigate their
claims. The result is not -- there is no regulatory --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then you think they should
be able to litigate a claim where the FDA has approved a
drug.
Now, is that the law in most places? Where
the FDA has approved a drug for use and the doctor
follows the label and the label is all okay, is it the
case that somebody can come in and say, despite that,
this drug is on balance harmful, and I get compensation?
This is a serious question. I'm not sure
how it works.
MS. ZIEVE: That is the law in every State.
JUSTICE BREYER: So --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's been contested,
and we are going to hear that case next term.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the next issue.
MS. ZIEVE: That's right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right. But it's been --
--
JUSTICE BREYER: I see.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- at least since the
30's, State tort litigation of the very kind that
Justice Breyer has described has gone on. Isn't that
so? That you -- even though the FDA has approved a
drug, an injured party can say this was a defective
drug, and the manufacturer says regulatory compliance.
That's a defense. And you would say it's a defense, but
not a conclusive defense.
MS. ZIEVE: Absolutely.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's how -- that's how
MS. ZIEVE: Yes. The FDA approval, Federal
approval, and State tort actions have co-existed since
38.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why? That's where I am
missing you. Why, then, does Michigan even have this
thing? In other words, why -- you are saying if they
didn't have it at all, you would go ahead and bring your
tort action.
MS. ZIEVE: That's right. Michigan chose --
JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.
MS. ZIEVE: -- to -- not to create a new
claim as the plaintiffs tried to do in Buckman, but,
rather, to take a traditional claim and restrict
plaintiff's ability to prevail on it.
This is not an expansion of State tort law.
It is a considerable narrowing of State tort law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, would you say that
my characterization of it when Mr. Phillips was
presenting his case, that this is an invigorated
regulatory compliance defense, that it is more
favorable, far more favorable, to the manufacturer than
the standard regulatory compliance because it says that
the manufacturer is immune, totally immune, unless --
and then the exception that we are debating here.
But it is a deliberately pro-manufacturer
measure. It gives the manufacturer an immunity that the
regulatory compliance defense does not.
MS. ZIEVE: And I would go even further.
It's not just pro-manufacturer. This statute is the
most deferential to the FDA of any State tort law in the
country. Other States will allow a manufacturer to
present evidence of compliance to show the product
wasn't defective, and that's non-dispositive evidence in
almost every State.
And then a plaintiff can come back and say:
Oh, but look, they didn't comply in these ways. And
that wouldn't be dispositive either in most States.
But only in Michigan not only is the
manufacturer's compliance defense dispositive in the
majority of cases, but the evidence of non-compliance
isn't even allowed as a rebuttal unless the plaintiff
can show that it actually was a material non-compliance
that would have made a difference.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in your view could a
State prohibit introduction of evidence by the defendant
that the drug was approved by the FDA?
MS. ZIEVE: Only to the extent that they
simply thought it wasn't relevant. And there are
States that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And all they say in the
statute: We just think -- they just think this is
irrelevant.
MS. ZIEVE: Sure. And there are States that
don't allow compliance --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I don't think that's
consistent with your position. There's no doubt about
that.
MS. ZIEVE: There are States that don't
allow compliance evidence if the plaintiff shows
material misrepresentation, "material" being that it
could have -- could have influenced the agency without a
finding that it did or would have influenced the agency,
but just that it was pertinent information.
And in those cases, this is discussed in
common -- either the restatement. In such a case some
States would say that the compliance evidence then can't
come in. And it is sort of the same theory as
Michigan's, but just not as strict against the
plaintiffs, that if you can't trust the -- the
compliance evidence isn't relevant. It's not meaningful
if you can't trust it. Because the --
JUSTICE BREYER: So to me, which is a good
answer, is you are saying: Look at the basic tort
system here. And if you can do that, you can do this.
Is that -- do you see where I'm --
MS. ZIEVE: If -- if the traditional tort
system as it exists in most every State is not
pre-empted, then Michigan's statute is not pre-empted.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Zieve, how many
States have a statute like Michigan's?
MS. ZIEVE: The Michigan statute is unique
with respect to the finding -- the requirement that
there be a finding of how the FDA would have acted if
the manufacturer had not made certain representations.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: No other State does that?
MS. ZIEVE: Texas has a similar statute
except it doesn't have that last element. And one of
the questions on severability is whether -- if you think
just that element is pre-empted, whether you can --
whether Michigan would want to sever that one element.
And then there are a number of States that
limit punitive damages liability but along the lines of
Texas, not Michigan. So, again, that last element is
not required.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But was there any
experience with this in Michigan? How many years was it
in operation before the Sixth Circuit decision?
MS. ZIEVE: I believe it went into effect in
March of '96. So, seven years.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have there been many
trials to test this theory that it would be disruptive,
that --
MS. ZIEVE: We were unable to find any
reported cases or Westlaw discussion of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the Sixth Circuit
case? It must have involved this, no?
MS. ZIEVE: Well, in the Sixth Circuit the
plaintiff said: We can't prove the exception, but it is
pre-empted and not severable. So we -- so that the the
statute would fall.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. What is your
position on severability? Why shouldn't we -- you know,
we usually accept the circuit court's determination as
to what the State law is. Michigan is in the Sixth
Circuit. And I think it's overwhelmingly likely that
the Second Circuit would defer to the Sixth Circuit's
view. Don't you think?
MS. ZIEVE: Well, in footnote 4 of the
Second Circuit's decision, Justice Calabrezze points out
that certification to the Michigan Supreme Court would
also be an option, and an option that the court doesn't
-- that court didn't even get to.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The discussion in the
Sixth Circuit was not very extensive on this point, on
this --
MS. ZIEVE: No, it wasn't. And this Court
has no -- has no practice with respect to deferring to
State law questions that were decided by courts of
appeals in a different case. That is, this case didn't
come to the Court from the Sixth Circuit.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I want to be sure I
understand something. In the other case, the plaintiff
is the one who argued there was pre-emption, and the
whole statute was invalid, and not the defendant.
MS. ZIEVE: That's right.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I see. I missed that.
MS. ZIEVE: Yes. It was a good try. But I
think that the severability argument is very closely
tied to the reason --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So the defendants kind of
take the risk when they make the argument they are
making. They have a chance to either lose or win.
MS. ZIEVE: Well, that's right. I mean, I
think the fact that Michigan is such a pro-manufacturer
State --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If there is no
severability, the defense is gone, period.
MS. ZIEVE: That's right.
The -- and the reason for severability,
though, was quite tied to the whole reason why we think
there's not preemption in the first place, which is that
the statute really needs to be looked at as a whole.
You can't -- you can't understand what the exception is
trying to accomplish without putting it in the context
of the statute. After all, it is -- it's subparagraph
(8) of subsection (5) of the Michigan statute.
If the Court has no further questions,
thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.
Mr. Phillips, you have five minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice Stevens.
Hopefully, I'll give you back some of that time, so you
can get to lunch.
Justice Kennedy, I think the best case for
us without Buckman would have been Hoyle versus United
Technologies. That's a case involving again a uniquely
federal interest. And the advantage of that particular
case is it also reflects that pre-emption is not an all
or nothing proposition. You can preempt out the
specific parts that is offensive and retain the part of
State law that is not offensive. And that's precisely
what we're trying to do in this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: There was special
consideration because of military considerations.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think that's what
made it a uniquely Federal interest. But I don't know
that it's any more a uniquely Federal interest than this
one. At least this is the way the Court has analyzed
both of them in Buckman.
Justice Ginsburg, with respect to
severability, I think, frankly, the Second Circuit
already answered the question. They said that we would
defer to the Sixth Circuit under Factors and then
analyze certification. And it concluded that, given the
clarity of the Sixth Circuit's decision in Garcia, that
there's nothing left to be decided on that issue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't think that the
Second Circuit discussed severability, but I can go back
and check.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you -- if you --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that it had
been raised there, but they didn't get to it because
they --
MR. PHILLIPS: I would suggest you read the
Petition Appendix 14a, where it says on the one hand,
under Factors we are bound to follow Garcia's
conclusions as to questions of Michigan State law, and
then the footnote reflects that the Sixth Circuit in
Garcia had clearly decided the severability issue here.
So, frankly, if --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In a very, very quick --
it isn't a very thoroughly reasoned discussion. It's a
is very -- it's just one paragraph.
MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure. But on the other
hand, it does seem to me that it spoke specifically to
the issue and recognized the right outcome.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, because it is
odd -- I mean, it is odd that you'd have a statute that
says: Manufacturer, we're going to give you immunity,
but there's an exception. They seem so tied together
and it really would be a case of letting one side keep
the sweet and get rid of the bitter. And it seems to me
that there is -- that there was no discussion of that in
the Sixth Circuit.
MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, but there is a discussion
of that in the Sixth Circuit decision. Garcia
specifically deals with that, because it says the bitter
that you have to take is if the FDA in fact makes all of
the very specific and intricate findings that are
required by the exception and concludes that the product
should be withdrawn for fraud, then in fact you get the
bitter, which is that the lawsuit goes forward under
those circumstances, and that that's the reasonable
compromise that the State legislature had in mind or
would have been satisfied with.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is
whether the legislature would have passed the statute
that it did if in a case like this one the manufacturer
could have the immunity without the exception.
MR. PHILLIPS: All I'm saying is I think the
Court addressed that in Garcia and specifically
concluded that the legislature in fact would have passed
that; And that traditionally, the Second Circuit would
defer, as would this Court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be -- it would
be open to the Second Circuit on remand because it's not
foreclosed.
MR. PHILLIPS: No, clearly it's not
foreclosed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, unless they choose
not to change their mind. I mean, they did say that
they're bound by this by Garcia as to questions of State
law.
MR. PHILLIPS: Exactly.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They said that: We are
bound by Garcia as to questions of State law.
MR. PHILLIPS: Exactly.
Justice Scalia, I'd like to answer your
question about if we were going forward with respect to
withdrawal as opposed to looking back. I mean, the FDA
still has the authority to order disgorgement, to order
restitution for victims. I think the notion that the
FDA is indifferent to claims of fraud is just -- is
flatly offensive. The reality is --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Does restitution for
victims include damages?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, whatever injuries --
yeah, I mean, I don't know exactly what the sweep of
restitution would be, but disgorgement of profits would
certainly provide a mechanism for providing --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you're not talking
about profits when you have an injured -- a patient who
died as a result of malpractice or something. That's
not disgorgement of profits. That's damages.
MR. PHILLIPS: I understand that. All I'm
suggesting, Justice Stevens, is that there are remedial
mechanisms still available to the FDA if in fact it
concluded that there was some problem, and that those --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It couldn't give recovery
to a class action of a couple of hundred plaintiffs who
were injured, could it? No such remedy under the FDA,
or am I wrong on that?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, as I understood the
FDA's position is that they have pretty broad remedial
authority and that it extends to some form of
restitution to the victims. So I --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government told us in
its brief that the FDA has no system for addressing
public complaints -- this was in their brief at page
-- because that would divert attention from their
primary mission. So there's no action for fraud that
one can bring to the FDA.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, there is a
provision for citizen petitions that exists, that's
cited. So, yes, there is a mechanism.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But The FDA doesn't have
to do anything about it?
