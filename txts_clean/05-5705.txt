CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Mr. Friedman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FRIEDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Court can decide these cases, as it
decided Crawford without testing the outer bounds of
the Confrontation Clause, by adopting a simple
proposition that is easily understood by and
intuitively sensible to ordinary lay people and so
capable of being passed on from generation to
generation as one of the cornerstones of our
fundamental liberties.
A criminal conviction cannot be based on an
accusation made privately to a known law enforcement
officer. If a State wishes that such an accusation
be presented in support of a conviction, then it must
ensure that the accuser testifies in the manner long
required by the common law system of criminal justice,
in the presence of the accused, under oath, and subject
to cross examination.
As in Crawford, the Court does not need to
offer a comprehensive definition of the term
testimonial. It is enough to say that an accusation to
a known law enforcement officer must be testimonial
under any plausible definition.
JUSTICE BREYER: When, for example, there's
an undercover agent, a law enforcement officer -- let's
think of the mafia or the Ku Klux Klan reveals himself.
One of the co-conspirators during the ongoing
conspiracy switches sides. But no. He doesn't switch.
He's still in the conspiracy. Makes a whole lot of
statements. Those are all inadmissible, though they'd
come in now because they would be in the furtherance of
the conspiracy.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Statements in furtherance of a
conspiracy, if I understand --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. There -- but there's
-- in other words, I've got your definition and all
I've tried to do is create a circumstance where, while
it fits your definition, it's made by a person that is
in the conspiracy. So I make him undercover, the law
enforcement officer.
MR. FRIEDMAN: If it's an undercover law
enforcement --
JUSTICE BREYER: But known.
MR. FRIEDMAN: By -- by known, I mean to the
declarant.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. FRIEDMAN: By known, I mean to the
declarant. So if it's --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. FRIEDMAN: -- if it's an undercover agent
and so it's a statement to an undercover --
JUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying my
hypothetical could never come up. What I'm trying to
do is -- it seems to me that your hypothetical is going
to take statements that would come in that are pretty
far removed from the prosecution that are in odd
circumstances, are not just a testimonial at all in
anybody's thought, but it keeps them out.
MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I'm afraid I -- I don't
fully understand the hypothetical. If the -- if the
officer is not known to the declarant as a law
enforcement officer, then there's no problem. Then --
then the statement could --
JUSTICE BREYER: He's known.
MR. FRIEDMAN: If he's -- he's known to the
law enforcement officer and the member of the
conspiracy is making a --
JUSTICE BREYER: It's continuing.
MR. FRIEDMAN: It's a continuing conspiracy,
but -- but that statement to the law enforcement
officer saying that somebody else in the conspiracy has
committed a crime, would not, in fact, be in
furtherance of the conspiracy. It would blow the
conspiracy apart.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. You've convinced
me I have a bad hypothetical.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: You go ahead.
MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I don't think it's --
Your Honor, I feel duty-bound to say there are no bad
hypotheticals, but there are -- there are easy ones,
and I think if -- if it's a known officer -- it's -- in
that situation, it's going to be accusatorial. If it's
not a known officer, it's -- it's not accusatorial --
JUSTICE ALITO: What if a statement is made
to a known law enforcement officer providing
information that's -- that's very incriminating against
somebody, but it doesn't specifically identify that
person? Does that fall within your test?
MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I believe it does. Of
course, in this case we have both, a description of the
crime and an identification of the perpetrator.
JUSTICE ALITO: So it's an accusation even
though it doesn't identify the person who is alleged to
be the perpetrator?
MR. FRIEDMAN: We could call it what we will.
I think -- I think that it still would be within the
narrow proposition that we're advocating that a -- that
a description of the crime to a known --
JUSTICE ALITO: So really, your test is any
evidence that's -- any statement made to the police or
-- is an -- is testimony.
MR. FRIEDMAN: No, Your Honor. I think it --
it either has to describe a crime or identify the
perpetrator or, as in this case, do both. So --
JUSTICE ALITO: Any relevant evidence given
to law enforcement is testimonial.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, when you say -- when you
say relevant, I think that if the law enforcement
officer -- if -- if it's a statement to a known law
enforcement officer in the line of duty, it's -- it's
almost always going to be testimonial. If it -- if it
identifies the -- the perpetrator or describes the
crime, I would say it's clearly testimonial, or if it's
in response to the -- to the officer's inquiries, it's
clearly --
JUSTICE ALITO: If somebody calls and says, I
just saw a blue Toyota with Ohio plates commit a hit
and run, that's testimonial?
MR. FRIEDMAN: I believe -- I believe so.
Now -- now, in fact, that would provide some
identifying information because it is a person who is
associated with that blue -- with that blue Toyota.
But if it's simply a officer in the donut shop, I just
saw Jack, he's back in town, with no clear relation to
any -- any crime, that's presumably just chatter and
that wouldn't be testimonial even if it -- even if it
later becomes relevant.
JUSTICE ALITO: But if it's relevant that
Jack is back in town, then that's testimonial.
MR. FRIEDMAN: If -- if at the moment that
it's made, the declarant understands that Jack being
back in town might be useful in an investigation, or if
a reasonable person in the position of the declarant
would understand it, that would be testimonial. Yes.
Yes, Your Honor.
So the -- the basic principle for which we're
advocating does not lie at the -- outside of the -- of
the definition of testimonial. I think it's simply a
core proposition.
JUSTICE ALITO: And the people who are making
all these statements are -- are to be understood as
witnesses against somebody within the -- the language
of the Confrontation Clause?
MR. FRIEDMAN: I think within the -- within
the meaning of the Confrontation Clause, if those
statements are allowed at proof -- as proof at trial
without the person coming in, then what we have
essentially done is created a system by which people
can create evidence for use by the legal system, by
engaging those statements without coming into court.
That's -- that's right.
And so I think one of the critical factors
here is to imagine what happens if statements, such as
the ones in -- in this case, are admitted -- are
admissible, and this Court holds -- holds that they
are, then basically they always can be admitted. Then
any State is free to create a system in which a
statement to a responding officer comes in as proof.
There's no need for the -- for the -- the declarant to
show up at trial, and there's no doubt that -- that
that is what would happen. California and Oregon have
already adopted such statutes, and -- and my State of
Michigan is on the verge of doing so.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Statutes that -- that say
what?
MR. FRIEDMAN: That say -- that say
accusations to a -- made to a law enforcement officer,
in the case of Oregon and the pending Michigan bill,
accusations of domestic violence are admissible so long
as they are made reasonably freshly -- but they give a
-hour time frame -- they -- they are admissible. No
need for excitement. So -- so the idea that -- that
the jurisdictions have limited this to -- to excited
utterances is -- is not -- is not so. If -- if the
Court affirms the decision here, I think the message
would go out that these -- that these statutes are
perfectly okay.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And those -- those --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and what -- what is
the theory on which the statutes are -- are adopted?
MR. FRIEDMAN: The --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the argument that
they propose to say it's not testimonial? I know you
disagree with it, but --
MR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Kennedy, the -- I
don't think there is a theory. And I say that quite
seriously. I -- I actually testified last month before
the Michigan House on the -- the bill saying I believe
this bill is blatantly unconstitutional. I believe
it's going to be held unconstitutional within a few
months. There was not a high level of interest in the
constitutional argument before the legislature. I
don't think there is a theory. I think the -- I think
the theory is that prosecutors say that these would be
good laws to pass. So --
JUSTICE BREYER: What's -- what's worrying me
on this is -- I'll tell you my concern without the
hypothetical. Crawford wrenches the Confrontation
Clause free of the hearsay rule, and therefore,
testimony -- it might be testimonial even though it is
not hearsay or falls within an -- doesn't fall within
an exception. You understand what I'm saying. Fine.
Now, you come along with a suggestion, and
what struck me immediately was that, wait a minute,
can't I easily think -- apparently not easily -- can't
I easily think of instances where it would be
testimonial but it isn't an accusation made to a
policeman. And conversely, can't I easily think -- not
easily -- of instances where, well, it would have come
in, but it was statements made to a policeman maybe
years before, maybe about this, maybe about that?
Maybe it's a hospital record. Maybe it's a business
record. There are all kinds of exceptions to the
hearsay rule, and they don't run parallel to the test
you've just given. That's what's worrying me. What's
the test?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, let -- let me be
very clear. We do not propose that this categorical
principle that an accusation to a law enforcement
officer is a definition of what's testimonial. We
regard this as a core category of testimonial
statements such as the core categories that the Court
listed in Crawford. So -- so if a statement fits
within that -- within that category, that is sufficient
to make it testimonial.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Such as in Crawford, but
in Crawford, it was the kind of formal statement, the
Court said, materials such as affidavits, custodial
examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was
unable to cross examine, or similar pretrial
statements. Similar pretrial statement is not an
agitated woman calling 911 or telling a police officer
who -- as in your case, who comes in response to a
call, there's a disturbance going on in that house, get
there.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. I -- I understand,
Justice Ginsburg. Of course, Crawford was only listing
a non-exclusive list of -- of core -- of core
categories.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. We -- we -- that --
that quotation was a -- a description of what Crawford
described as the core.
--
MR. FRIEDMAN: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not the totality of
MR. FRIEDMAN: Certainly not the totality,
and if you say, well, this statement was informal, it
-- it doesn't make sense and I think it conflicts with
a comment in Crawford in footnote 3 to say, well,
informal testimony is -- is okay, as the Court said in
-- in Crawford. If -- if sworn out-of-court testimony
is invalid, it wouldn't make sense to say that unsworn
testimonial statements are perfectly okay.
Now, so far as the principle that -- that
because the witness is under agitation, the -- the
Confrontation Clause doesn't -- doesn't apply, I don't
think that's -- that's valid at -- at all. It
certainly isn't valid historically. If -- if it were,
we would have seen examples over history in which
agitated declarants -- their statements came in. But
as -- as General Dreeben has indicated, the very -- the
very organizing principle of prosecution was that the
accuser must come and -- come and testify.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the legislatures that
have passed laws of the kind you describe have before
them information that there is a rather high incidence
of the victim being intimidated and therefore not
showing up in court to testify?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Your -- Your Honor, in the --
in the Old Bailey sessions papers there were
approximately 2 percent of the cases, the victim who
was the prosecutor did not show up. It was a recurring
-- a recurring matter. Why they didn't show up may
have been for various reasons. And I want to emphasize
that the State in the very first paragraph of its brief
emphasizes that there are numerous reasons why, in the
domestic violence context, the -- the accuser may not
testify in court. And in those roughly 2 percent of
all the cases, which is 2,000 cases, in not a single
one -- well, I'm sorry. There was one in which there
was a -- a conviction. That's because -- because the
defendant -- because the defendant confessed. But in
all the others, the accusation was -- the -- the case
was summarily dismissed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you have to
assume not only that the victim is unwilling or
reluctant to testify, you have to assume that the
victim has disappeared because the victim, unwilling or
not, could be subpoenaed. Isn't that right?
MR. FRIEDMAN: The -- the victim could be
subpoenaed, and in -- in this case, as in Davis, the
victim was subpoenaed, but subpoenas have to be
enforced. And -- and I think in some cases the
prosecution does -- simply doesn't enforce the
subpoenas. It's what the Cook County --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, but I'm saying the scope
of the problem is -- is much more narrow than what is
suggested by simply describing how often it is that the
-- that the complaining witness is reluctant to
testify. That doesn't stop anything.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Reluctant or not, that
witness can be -- can be subpoenaed.
MR. FRIEDMAN: That is -- that is correct,
Justice Scalia. It is the State's choice whether to
compel the -- the person to -- to testify, and if, as
Cook County has done, they put in particular efforts to
protect the witness, to encourage her to testify, then
prosecutors get a very high return. That is, in -- in
the Cook County program, 80 percent of -- of the
witnesses testify. They get a very high conviction
rate, and they protect the -- the witnesses.
So I think the message from this Court is
going to be one of two things. Either it's okay to
adopt a California/Oregon type of statute and just --
just let any statements come -- come in, or we have to
put in the resources to -- to -- into domestic violence
to ensure that the witnesses come -- come to court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know why the or
would necessarily follow. I mean, if you prevail,
there's nothing that compels the State to put money in
what has been suggested, a training program, shelters,
counselors for these people.
MR. FRIEDMAN: They --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Nothing at all compels the
State to do that.
MR. FRIEDMAN: They -- they would not be
compelled to do that, but -- they would not be
compelled constitutionally to do that. They would
simply be deprived of a -- of -- of the so-called
evidence-based prosecution, which has just been a
phenomenon of the last 14 years.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Your point, I thought, was
that that would be the incentive for --
MR. FRIEDMAN: That -- that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for police departments,
of course --
MR. FRIEDMAN: That -- that -- that is
correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if they want to make
their cases.
MR. FRIEDMAN: That is correct. They -- they
would -- they want to make their cases, and -- and I
think they can make their cases best if the witness
testifies, in which case, under the Confrontation
Clause now -- now construed, there's no objection then
to bringing in the prior statement at all.
JUSTICE BREYER: What about present sense
perceptions? That might be a good one.
MR. FRIEDMAN: And -- and --
JUSTICE BREYER: Apparently 803(1) has the
first exception --
MR. FRIEDMAN: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- to the hearsay rule.
It's present sense impression.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: So on the phone, somebody is
describing very calmly -- very calmly to the policeman
the terrible crime that he sees going on in front of
him. Now, I gather from the fact that it's an -- that
it is a exception, that now in the Federal courts that
would be admissible.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, it would have been under
Roberts presumably.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. No. Forget the --
yes. Every day of the week, they come in. Is that
right? Present sense impressions. It's here as the
first exception to the hearsay rule.
MR. FRIEDMAN: It's -- it's an exception. In
civil cases, there's no problem. In -- in criminal
cases --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there it is, 803(1).
MR. FRIEDMAN: That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, and you practiced
this for years. See. I mean, you're an expert in
this, and I -- I think my impression -- just tell me if
I'm wrong -- is it's 803(1). It says a present sense
impression comes in. So I guess it does unless I'm --
MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes, but until -- until White
v. Illinois basically let the guard down, these --
these statements could not come -- accusatory
statements that might have been in present sense
impressions did not -- were -- were not the basis for
prosecutions. Once -- once White v. Illinois was
decided, then -- then courts allowed them in routinely.
JUSTICE BREYER: So if we adopt your rule, a
person calls up on the phone and says, I'm here at the
baseball game, there's a terrible crime going on in
front of me, and he describes it --
MR. FRIEDMAN: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- to the police officer,
that no longer could come in.
--
MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I believe that is correct
because that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I should hope not. I mean
MR. FRIEDMAN: It -- it shouldn't. It's an
accusatory -- it's an accusatory statement to -- to a
-- a -- to law enforcement.
Now, I mean, the Court could, if it wanted,
carve out or -- or draw the line at statements that are
describing the contemporaneous -- the absolutely
contemporaneous commission of a crime. I don't think
it's a particularly good line to draw.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I wasn't --
MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- trying to reduct you out
of --
MR. FRIEDMAN: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: I just wanted to know what
the facts are about the rule. I was just -- that's
what I was asking.
MR. FRIEDMAN: The -- the rule is that the
hearsay law -- the rule against hearsay provides -- the
modern rule against hearsay provides no -- no
restriction. The Confrontation Clause should.
And let me address the -- your concern,
Justice Breyer, that is this hearsay rather than --
than confrontation. I think -- I think that the notion
of the accuser is central to the confrontation right
and always -- and always has been, and those 2,000
cases really develop. As of 1791, the rule against
hearsay was barely developed, and we cite -- or the
-- the rule against hearsay was barely developed and
Edmund Burke said that a trained parrot could recite
all the laws of evidence in 5 minutes, and that is no
longer -- that is no longer so.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Edmund Burke say that?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Edmund Burke said that, yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Friedman, can I go
back to your answer that the police will then -- in
response to the position that you're urging, will then
protect the victim and all these fine things? It
wasn't so long ago that the police wouldn't bother with
these prosecutions at all. They didn't care about
them. And if you say you're going to have to drag in
the victim, you're going to have to jail her for
contempt if she's so scared that she won't testify,
they'll say, who needs it. We've got a lot of other
crimes to prosecute.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, I -- I hope not, Your
Honor, and I -- I believe that we've gotten past the
point. I mean, I think we now recognize how serious a
-- a crime domestic violence is.
Let me emphasize that it is just as now
sometimes a prosecutor will compel a victim to
testify. It will still be that sometimes they will and
sometimes they won't. That will be a matter of -- of
State policy. There are other approaches as -- as
well. And -- and hopefully, compulsion isn't
necessary, I think, if the prosecutors pay -- pay
sufficient attention and -- and care, but beyond that,
there's the possibility of forfeiture. If, indeed, the
reason why the victim will not testify is because of
intimidation, then -- then the prosecution -- it is
open to the prosecution to prove that. In many cases,
the case can be proven --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's very powerfully
hard to prove, isn't it?
MR. FRIEDMAN: I don't think so, Your Honor.
And -- and, of course, it remains to be seen just how
easy or how hard it -- it is to -- to prove. But, in
fact, the -- as Mr. Fisher said, the rules of evidence
don't apply at the -- at the preliminary hearing. It's
the judge, not the -- the jury that has to decide. And
the standard of proof presumably would not be beyond a
reasonable doubt. So --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you are back --
as Justice Breyer pointed earlier, you're making the
prosecution prove two crimes instead of one.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, intimidation is -- is a
crime, but it wouldn't -- it wouldn't be a full
criminal case. It would, as in many other contexts,
simply a preliminary hearing on -- on a threshold
issue. As we have for every evidentiary problem, for
every -- for any -- any evidentiary problem, such as
does the present sense impression exception apply,
there's a preliminary --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but every
evidentiary problem, the -- the root of the problem is
not the inability of the -- or the unwillingness of the
primary victim to testify. I mean, that's what makes
intimidation so hard to prove in these cases is because
you have to get the -- if -- if the intimidation is
successful, the witness to testify about the -- the
crime is unavailable and unwilling to do so.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, it -- it would remain
for the Court to determine what the standards are for
proving --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you wouldn't have to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt, would you?
MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I wouldn't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This is -- this
is a pretrial hearing on whether the -- the -- there's
been intimidation. Couldn't the judge just find it
more likely than not that the defendant has intimidated
a witness?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Prior decisions of the Court
suggest that that would most likely be the -- the
standard. It may be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the -- the judge
can't make that finding if the witness doesn't testify,
can he?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Oh, I think that -- that the
judge may well, and I think it would remain --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How's that? The
prosecutor goes in and says, we think the defendant has
intimidated the witness by saying he's not going to
support her financially, he's going to leave, whatever,
and -- and the -- presumably the -- the defendant says
no -- no, and the witness isn't there. The judge says,
well, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that he
has intimidated her?
MR. FRIEDMAN: I think it remains an open
question what the standards would be for -- for proof
and whether that would be constitutionally accepted.
This, of course, is a matter for -- for another day.
I think what the Court can't do is
effectively assume as a -- or create an irrebuttable
presumption that in all domestic violence cases, the --
the victim has been intimidated, which is what the
State asks, even though they acknowledge at the very
outset that there are many other reasons why -- why the
victim may not testify. The -- there's no domestic
violence exception for the confrontation right, just as
there's no organized crime exception for the
confrontation right.
So I do think that -- that what the
procedures are for forfeiture is -- is a big open
question. But -- but it's the State's burden to prove
forfeiture. It -- it can't be assumed as a per se
matter.
JUSTICE BREYER: Do you have a second choice
rule? I mean, we have Professor Amar, who has pretty
formal criteria.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: We have the rule that you
just enunciated, and I don't want, before you sit down,
to -- I want to find out if you have an intermediate
position, a fall-back position.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, our -- our narrow rule
is -- is simply the -- an accusation to a law
enforcement officer. We -- we, of course, believe that
the more general test is reasonable expectation of the
declarant and that's where -- where I disagree with --
with Professor Amar. I don't know that he would -- I
don't know that he would disagree. I'd be surprised if
he would disagree that an accusation to a law
enforcement officer is -- is testimonial because --
because that is such a -- a narrow principle. Now --
now, he does speak about -- about formality, but
formality, for reasons I suggested, I don't think -- I
don't think makes an awful lot of sense because it then
gives the police officers and prosecutors an incentive
to take testimony informally.
And what we have then, as in this case, we
have not the affidavit, which -- which the State is
condemning as admissible. They now concede that that's
inadmissible. The evidence on which this prosecution
is based is a police officer's rendition of what he was
told orally, which is a denigrated form of -- form of
evidence. That's where a formality rule will -- will
get you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where do you
come out on the person running out of the house and
yelling to her neighbor with the law enforcement
officer standing by?
MR. FRIEDMAN: And -- and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not -- the
statement is not to the law enforcement officer, but he
or she overhears it.
MR. FRIEDMAN: If -- if the -- if the speaker
knows that the law enforcement officer is there --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't.
MR. FRIEDMAN: -- then -- then I -- then --
then it's not within the narrow categorical rule for which
we're -- we're asking now. It may come within the
general test of reasonable expectation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is anybody -- is
anybody working for the State a law enforcement
officer?
MR. FRIEDMAN: No, not -- not within the --
within the narrow categorical rule that we're asking.
I think it's another question if, say, you're speaking
to a -- a doctor who's an employee of the State
hospital --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Or a 911 operator who was an
agent of -- of the police.
MR. FRIEDMAN: A 911 operator is a direct
conduit to the police, and the police are a direct
conduit to the court.
And -- and that addresses your hypothetical,
Justice Scalia, about the -- the affidavit right to the
court. The person writes an affidavit right to the
court. Under -- under the theory presented by the
State under the resemblance theory -- let's take away
the -- the sworn part of the affidavit. It's just a
letter or -- or a message over the Internet or a
videotape. All of those would be allowed because
there's no formality, because there's no interrogation,
and that's a grotesque result --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure what -- what
sense it makes. Two cases. The woman runs out and --
and says, he -- he stabbed me and I'm dying, he's a
murderer. Case one, it's a -- a neighbor. Case two,
it's a police officer and she sees that he's a police
officer. Why -- why should there be a difference? It
doesn't make any sense to me.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, I'm -- I'm not saying
there necessarily should be a difference. I think -- I
think in the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought your test
was if she knows that he's a police officer, it's
testimonial.
MR. FRIEDMAN: We're saying that is an easy
case. That's what Professor Mosteller called a dead
bang case where it's made to a police officer.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me put it this
way. I don't know why one case is so easier than the
other.
MR. FRIEDMAN: I think it's an easier case
because the police officer is a direct conduit to the
-- to the machinery of -- of justice. When you're
speaking to a police officer, you know you're speaking
to the State.
If the Court has no further questions, I'll
reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Fisher.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Amy Hammon's oral statements to Officer
Mooney arose in an emergency situation very similar to
a 911 call, not in a situation where a detective was
attempting to subvert the judicial system by developing
evidence in secret with no intention of ever letting
the witness testify at trial.
JUSTICE SCALIA: She's sitting down at -- at
a table, as I recall it, with the -- with the police
officer on the other side of the table.
--
MR. FISHER: She may -- yes, I think.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Has a cup of coffee.
MR. FISHER: Well, I don't know about that.
She was in the living room.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought there was a cup of
coffee, too. Maybe -- I don't know where I got that
from. Maybe I made it up.
MR. FISHER: Well, what we know is that the
JUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't seem to me a
terribly emergency situation in -- in that kind of a
context.
MR. FISHER: I respectfully disagree, Your
Honor. We're talking about a woman who has -- has
stated that she has suffered a beating from her
husband, that -- a beating that may flare up at any
time if the officers withdraw, and the officer needs to
know what happened so that he can properly address the
situation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: At the time, the officer is
right there in the house. There's certainly no
emergency at the time. Now, you could say that -- that
the woman is frightened about a recurrence, but if --
if that's your definition of an emergency, it's going
to cover an awful lot of situations.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think it's -- the -- the
moment to consider is not just the moment when the
officers are present, but in fact, what would happen if
the officers were to do nothing, which is one of the
choices that, I suppose, the officers had. They could
find out what was going on and address the situation,
or they could withdraw, doing nothing, and then leave
Amy Hammon to her own devices in a highly explosive
situation.
They -- we don't know exactly what -- what
Officer Mooney said when he went back into the living
room, but what we know is that there was no apparent
interrogation of any type. We know that Amy Hammon at
that point told him the story of the argument that had
taken place and the resulting physical abuse.
Now, what we know from -- from the accusation
test that is put forth by -- by the petitioner is
that the reason that it doesn't apply apparently to all
statements to -- to police officers is that it must
somehow take account of the co-conspirator statement.
But we don't otherwise have any grounding of that test
in the history of the Confrontation Clause.
The test that we are proposing, the broader
test that we are proposing, the resemblance test, flows
directly from statements in Crawford suggesting
that the way that we know what is testimonial and what
is not is by examining the lessons of history. What
we're proposing is that in any particular context, if
the statement resembles one of those historical abuses
in the civil law tradition, then in that circumstance
it's testimonial. But if the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't the problem,
though -- I mean, as Crawford said, those examples
defined the core. They were the paradigms, but they
didn't purport to cover the whole ground. And it seems
to me that your argument is to turn the core into the
exclusive examples, in which case the Confrontation
Clause in the real world is never going to apply.
MR. FISHER: Your Honor, I think the
important lesson from Crawford in that regard is -- is
the methodology, and the methodology was let's look at
history. What does history tell us the Founders were
concerned about? And the Court listed the specific
examples of affidavits, depositions, pretrial hearings,
and -- and expanded that even to include interrogation.
And in -- excuse me -- particular cases coming --
coming up, if there is evidence that -- that the
statements do correspond to historical abuses, even if
those abuses were not listed in Crawford, then that
would be a different situation. That would be testimonial.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not sure that that
was the only concern of the Founders, I mean, the --
the -- you know, the -- the fact that -- that the State
could corrupt the -- the statement through the
interrogation. I'm not sure that was the only concern.
I -- I think the Founders believed in a judicial
system, at least in criminal cases, where the person
has a right to cross examine his accuser. Whether the
fact that the -- I am -- I'll put it this way.
I am quite sure that it would have been held
a violation of the Confrontation Clause if, as the
prior example I gave, someone wrote out an affidavit
and sent it directly to the court, no intervening
police interrogation at all, just wrote out an
affidavit from -- from France, mailed it to the court,
and the court has this affidavit. I am sure that would
be a smack-bang violation of the Confrontation Clause.
And there's none of the -- the abuse that -- on -- on
which you -- you would hinge the entirety of the
violation.
MR. FISHER: Well, except that we do know
that -- that affidavits, I agree, would have been
prohibited, and that's one of the classic forms of
testimony, indeed, that was enumerated in Crawford and
that was kept out at the founding. And that falls into
a very well-defined category.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But one of the reasons for
that is -- let's assume you had a completely honest
police officer. You may have a motive on the part of
the witness to frame the defendant. I mean, that's
another reason.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think it ostensibly
could be. I think what we know, though, looking back
at what -- at the -- at the Raleigh trial and at -- at
the -- at the trials even in the colonial period, was
that the Founders were concerned about abuses by the
State, in -- in particular, in interrogations and in
eliciting these affidavits and in using pretrial
testimony.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm suggesting to you
that it often happens that there are false charges made
that the -- that the police believe to be true.
MR. FISHER: The false charges scenario is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this is fully
consistent with prohibiting testimonial statements.
MR. FISHER: Again, I think what Crawford was
talking about, in terms of trying to understand the
Confrontation Clause, was not simply to hypothesize
various problems that different types of evidence could
present if it weren't cross examined, but instead to
examine more particularly what the Founders were
concerned about. And that was not one of the -- of the
categories simply --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this, Mr. Fisher?
What is your answer to Justice Scalia's hypothetical,
an entirely volunteered affidavit by the accuser? Is
that admissible or not?
MR. FISHER: I think that -- well, certainly
it's testimonial, and so --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So that would be prohibited
by the Confrontation Clause. Yet, that was clearly not
an example that would fall within the Marian practice.
MR. FISHER: Well, whether it would have come
in --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, it doesn't resemble
it is what I'm saying.
MR. FISHER: Whether it would have been a
problem under the Marian practice I think is only part
of the story. And certainly Crawford recognized that
affidavits as a category were part of the -- of the
tradition that led to the abuses that the Founders were
concerned about. So Marian is, again, part of the
story but not necessarily the whole thing.
Now, when we articulate this resemblance --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you leave that,
surely the affidavit isn't -- isn't what's magical. I
mean, I'm going to change my hypothetical. The person
recites his accusation on a tape recorder and mails the
tape to the court. Now, are you going to say, well,
it's not an affidavit? You'd exclude that as well,
wouldn't you?
MR. FISHER: Well, I -- I don't know that I
would because, again, you've got the -- you've got the
form that Crawford was concerned about. The affidavit
is the classic form.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That would make no sense at
all. I mean, that -- that is just the worst sort of
formalism. If you do it in an affidavit, it's -- it's
bad, but if you put it on a tape, it's -- it's good. I
-- I cannot understand any reason for that.
MR. FISHER: Well, I don't know that the
analysis has to end there. I think, for example, there
were other circumstances where other types of
communications were problematic. In -- in Raleigh's
trial, for example, Cobham had submitted a letter, and
that was recited as part of the -- the concern. Now,
if the Court were to determine that a recording of that
sort was similar enough, it resembled enough that sort
of abuse, then yes, it could be testimonial.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, let me again be
sure I understand your position. Would the unsworn
letter that Justice Scalia describes be admissible or
inadmissible under your view?
MR. FISHER: I think that there is evidence
historically that a letter would be testimonial,
certainly coming out of Cobham's case and -- and other
circumstances.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So then you don't rely on
the affidavit point.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think it's -- it's a
matter of what -- what is covered, what is mentioned in
history. Affidavit is one of those -- those
categories. Letters, in particular, in Raleigh's trial
was another area that may have been problematic. And I
think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: If that's your criterion,
are you going to draw the distinction between the
letter and the tape recording?
MR. FISHER: Well, I think that that is the
-- whether we have the resemblance test doesn't require
us to answer that question because I think that the
examination the Court would undertake would again --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's answer it. Is
-- is the tape recording like the letter so that it --
it's inadmissible?
MR. FISHER: I think it's -- I think it is
very similar to the letter and -- and could well be
inadmissible, but I don't know that it's -- if the
Court adheres to the test that it set forth in
Crawford, that it's looking for forms of testimony that
were prohibited at common law, certainly that would not
have been one of them.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A videotape -- a
videotape of a crime scene is admissible. Right?
MR. FISHER: I think that's -- that's right.
Now, if it's -- if you have a videotape of someone
that -- that's responding to an interrogation, that's
an entirely different thing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.
MR. FISHER: But a videotape of a crime scene
again would be -- would be not testimonial.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But a tape recording
by the same person who videotaped the crime scene,
describing what he saw, you agree would be excluded.
MR. FISHER: I think that there's a high
chance that could be -- be excluded.
JUSTICE BREYER: So what's the test?
MR. FISHER: It's the resemblance test, and
the question --
JUSTICE BREYER: Resemblance to?
MR. FISHER: To the historical abuses that
the Founders were trying to address. And the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Which were?
MR. FISHER: Well, which were in particular,
we know, affidavits. We also know something about
letters, and the question with the tape recording is,
is it enough like, does it resemble those enough?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you accept the
Government's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I think the problem with
the examples is that none of these are abuses. As I
see it, the examples of the tape recording mailed in
and the volunteer statement, I don't see how you can
call those abuses.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think the abuse comes
not simply in how they were created, but -- but then in
how they were later used. And -- and again, we're
talking about trying to -- to craft a rule in part that
has some bright lines to it based on -- on just what
was -- what forms were not used --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't the -- the
bright line that the Government asserts that this is a
crime made in an urgent situation, when one doesn't --
the declarant doesn't think rationally will this be
used eventually in a trial, where the declarant wants
to stop an imminent threat?
MR. FISHER: I certainly think that that
follows from the -- the overall test we propose.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's a different
test than the resemblance test that you're proposing.
MR. FISHER: Our position is it's a corollary
to it. And certainly it's a narrower test and applies,
I think, here in -- in both cases to that, and it
provides the opportunity resolve both cases on the
notion that when the officers were at the scene, they
were in no way behaving like inquisitors. They showed
up. They were -- they could -- they were in the middle
of -- of an abusive situation that could explode at any
time, and they needed to know what -- what was going on
in order to diffuse the situation. So this case could
be resolved on that -- on a much narrower ground.
It's -- it's important here also to -- to
recognize that what the -- what the prosecution did has
no -- no similarity to what would happen at the common
law. We have here the government issuing a subpoena to
Amy Hammon to come and testify and, obviously, showing
that they would have preferred the live testimony in
this case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there -- was there any
showing at all of whether they made the police -- or
the prosecutor made any effort to enforce the subpoena?
MR. FISHER: There was no such effort, Your
Honor. But, well, here, if I may be permitted to go
beyond the record just a little bit, what we -- what we
do know is that the case was continued one time because
Amy Hammon did not show up in response to a subpoena,
and that the second time, the -- the trial proceeded.
But there was no effort to send someone out to -- to
enforce it or to bring any sort of contempt sanction.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's assume your --
you have here a woman who's sitting down in the kitchen
with the police officer, talks to the police officer,
and then signs an affidavit. Did she sign the
affidavit at that time?
MR. FISHER: That's right, yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that affidavit was not
admissible because it's an affidavit.
MR. FISHER: Correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the police officer who
testified to what she said and what he wrote down in
the affidavit that she signed, that does get in.
MR. FISHER: Correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I can't see why that
makes any sense at all. I mean, she -- she was either
testifying when she spoke and then signed the
affidavit, as evidence of her testimony, or -- or else
she wasn't testifying, in which case both the affidavit
and the oral statement should be in. I can't -- I
can't see drawing the line between those two. It
really seems very strange to me.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think whether you look
at it from her perspective or from the officer's
perspective, that something did change in the moment
between the oral statement and the affidavit.
If you look at it from -- from the officer's
perspective, once Amy Hammon disclosed to him what had
happened and -- and gave him information that he needed
to handle the situation, then he could go about
handling the situation. He didn't need the affidavit
to do that. Once he turned to get the affidavit, he --
he was transitioning to -- less from an emergency mode
and more to an evidence-gathering mode.
If you're -- if you are looking at it from
the standpoint of Amy Hammon, then at that point, when
-- when Officer Mooney is -- is in the house and has
her husband, you know, in another room and she's trying
to just describe what's going on so that she can be
protected, that's a far different mind set.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's a --
it's a classic mixed motive case. We don't know when
the officer is sitting down with her and asking the
questions, whether his primary motive is to make sure
the guy doesn't come back or if his primary motive is
to help make the case against the guy. It's both.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think it's reasonable to
assume that officers, faced with an emergency
situation, are primarily going to be working for --
from a concern of safety, for their own and for others.
And so even if it is a mixed motive, I think that the
point is that particular circumstance, it's reasonable
to infer where there's an emergency -- ongoing
emergency, an ongoing immediate safety concern, that
safety and security are going to be the primary motive.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does his motive matter?
I mean, the -- the issue is whether she is testifying,
whether she is a witness, and I don't see how that
changes when she tells him these things orally and when
she signs the affidavit afterwards. It seems to me
she's testifying as to what events had occurred.
MR. FISHER: Well, let me be clear that we're
not suggesting a subjective inquiry into the officer's
motive, but what we are saying is that whether a
statement is testimonial depends on whether the
government is -- is purely collecting evidence, making
someone undergo an interrogation, for example, or
whether they are performing tasks that really were not
part of -- of any type of police function at the
founding, which is sort of a community caretaking,
public safety function, so that by definition in
eliciting statements concerning the immediate safety
issue, the police officer could not have been engaged
in the kinds of abuses that gave rise --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. This is helpful,
very helpful to me, but I'm trying to see what you're
driving at. I'm imagining the woman saying, he's
hitting me, he's just hit me. She's in tears. That's
excited utterance. Not. Then suddenly the officer, 5
minutes later, says I've heard what you said. Let's
reduce it to writing. Here's the formal affidavit, et
cetera, that is -- but to prevent Mr. Friedman's
problem, we're going to have to say as to the second,
that is even if you don't have the formality, you see,
everything is the same, but not the formality. Now,
how do we do that?
MR. FISHER: I'm not sure if I'm following.
Not formality --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm making the distinction
you're making between she's in tears, excited utterance
or res gestae, around there, just what you were talking
about. Now think of the second affidavit -- when he
reduces it to writing. That's different, calmer,
clearly motive to testify, et cetera. Fine. But now
what Mr. Friedman pointed out is if we make it turn
solely on the formality, the piece of paper, the stamp,
et cetera, they'll just avoid that. So we're going to
have to sweep into the second the circumstance where
everything is the same but the formality, and that's
where I have the difficulty.
MR. FISHER: Well, again, the -- the
difficult task of understanding the Confrontation
Clause is to figure out what limits there might be, and
-- and in Crawford, the methodology was what does
history tell us the Framers were concerned about. And
certainly the formal affidavit was something that they
were very concerned about. The less formal forms they
were not.
And certainly when it comes to something as
-- as recent, you know, relatively speaking, as -- as
the community caretaking function of the police, that
was in no way part of -- of the abuses that the Framers
were concerned about. And so I think even if the Court
were to limit its decision to that part of the test,
resolving the other instances, according to the
resemblance test or -- or trying to figure out where to
draw that -- you know, that line, could come later,
consistent with its decision in this case.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But your answer, I take it,
assumes that the Framers had no concern with the
capacity of the court to test the -- the validity or
the truth of the statement.
MR. FISHER: Well, I'm not entirely sure if
that's the case. I mean, I -- of course, they were
operating in a -- in a circumstance where -- where
hearsay rules were -- were part of trial process.
Certainly also, to the extent that -- that a particular
procedure is -- is outrageous, the -- a due process
concern might arise, but --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but -- no. But I'm --
I'm not talking about outrageous circumstances in which
the -- the statement was taken. I'm talking about the
capacity of the court, by whatever means, to test the
truth of that statement once it is placed before the
court. And I understood your argument to Justice
Breyer to assume that that testing function was not
within the contemplation of the Framers.
MR. FISHER: I think it was with respect to
-- to the abuses that -- testimony elicited through the
abuses that gave rise to the clause, the -- the common
-- or I'm sorry -- the civil law type abuses. They did
want to test that, but the concern --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So that your -- your -- you
would then say they want a -- they want to test certain
-- in certain cases where they think there may have
been an abuse in the elicitation of the statement, but
if there is -- there is no reason to suspect that the
statement was taken under untoward circumstances, they
were not concerned to test its validity.
MR. FISHER: I think that -- that that's
largely accurate, but they were dealing with, I think,
a rather set form.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But is that your position?
MR. FISHER: Well, yes, but -- but if I may
add a clarification, which is to say, the reason I
think that we could circumscribe affidavits, regardless
of whether the elicitation abuses are present, is
simply for ease of administration, that abuses known to
the Framers would have been arising in a circumstance
where there would have been those abuses, and -- and as
a form --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Don't -- don't you think the
Framers were aware of the fact that although there were
law enforcement abuses, Raleigh's case and so on, there
were also abuses every day of the week on the part of
people who gave false testimony because they had
grudges against the defendant? Do you think that was
totally out of the minds of the Framers so as to
support the distinction that -- that as a general rule
you were suggesting?
MR. FISHER: We don't know exactly all of the
details that would have -- that they were
contemplating.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But why would -- why would
we impute that -- that unconcern to the Framers about
the -- the need to test statements which may very well
have -- have been given because of envy, grudge, and so
MR. FISHER: Because of -- of what we do know
and what Crawford said that we do know, which is that
we know that they were responding to things like
Raleigh's trial and to Stamp Act, you know,
enforcement, other --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but doesn't -- doesn't
that get us back to the fact that those examples were
given in Crawford as paradigm examples, if, you know,
those were -- I think the word poor was used. But --
but Crawford was not limited to that, and if it's not
limited to that, why, in effect, does the -- does the
-- should we conclude that the concern of the clause
stops short of the self-interested witness even though
he didn't make an affidavit?
MR. FISHER: Again, if I may be permitted to
finish. The methodology -- the methodology of Crawford
is to look for known circumstances of abuse, about
which the Framers were concerned, and we don't have
that sort of historical evidence more generally.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Gornstein.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
We are asking the Court to apply the same
standard to statements made to officers at the scene as
to statements made during a 911 call. If the statement
is made in response to police questions that are
reasonably necessary to determine whether an emergency
exists --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, under your view,
was the affidavit admissible?
MR. GORNSTEIN: The affidavit is not
admissible.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?
MR. GORNSTEIN: The affidavit is -- is not
admissible because, by that point, the officer had the
information that he needed to resolve the emergency,
and what he was soliciting at that point --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I would suggest the reason
it was not admissible is it's very clear that the
affidavit is the testimonial statement by a witness
that the defendant had a right to confront. The
constitutional right is the right to confront the
witnesses against him.
MR. GORNSTEIN: I was just getting to that,
Justice Stevens --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh.
MR. GORNSTEIN: -- that the -- the emergency
was resolved, and at that point, he was --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But you say if the officer
independently repeats what is said in the affidavit,
then he's the witness against rather than the --
MR. GORNSTEIN: No, not -- no. He's -- he's
not -- if he was repeating what was said in the
affidavit, that's a different point. He's repeating
the statement that was made before the affidavit was
given. That was at a point at which the -- there was
still an immediate danger and that he was asking a
question that was reasonably necessary to determine
whether that danger existed and, if so, how to resolve
JUSTICE SCALIA: What was the immediate
danger?
MR. GORNSTEIN: When -- the immediate danger
was --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, there's the
policeman in the room across the kitchen table from --
from the woman.
MR. GORNSTEIN: The --
JUSTICE SCALIA: He's not on the end of a
phone line. He's in the room across the kitchen table.
MR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct. And -- and
the problem here is what the danger was what would
happen if the officers left. When -- when the officer
came in and saw a frightened Ms. Hammon, he saw
wreckage on the floor, he had reason to be concerned
that there was a very recent attack on her and that if
he left the scene, that attack would be renewed.
Asking Ms. Hammon what happened was reasonably
necessary to determine whether that emergency existed
and, if so, how to resolve it.
Now, once he had that information, he had
what he needed to resolve the emergency, and at that --
JUSTICE ALITO: In a situation like that,
what was needed to resolve the situation, if he
believed what Mrs. Hammon said, was to arrest Mr.
--
Hammon. Right?
MR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct.
JUSTICE ALITO: So he could -- you think he
could gather as much evidence as was necessary to
arrest Mr. Hammon.
MR. GORNSTEIN: I do not. At some --
JUSTICE ALITO: Why -- why not? Why doesn't
that follow?
MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, at some point, what --
what turns into emergency resolution moves over into
interrogation, and once you reach interrogation, then
you have reached the core of what Crawford talks about
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we know when that
line is crossed? You said reasonably necessary to
protect safety. That's okay. Interrogation is not
good. But how -- how does one tell when one stops and
the other starts?
MR. GORNSTEIN: I -- I think this is going to
be a line-drawing question, but when you have a
situation like this one where you have an officer who's
just on the scene in the immediate wake of a -- of a
domestic dispute, he asks a single question, what
happened, in -- in circumstances in which he needed to
know the answer to that question to make sure he could
leave and leave her there safely. That's not
interrogation. If he sat around for a half hour with a
back-and-forth and give-and-take and trying to press
and get to the situation in that kind of back-and-
forth, that would be interrogation colloquially. And
it's -- it's that kind of line that the Court is going
to need to draw.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Because he might be
interrogating with no idea at all primarily in his mind
of later court appearance. He wants to find out if
there are guns in the house. He wants to find out if
there are other people in the house. He wants to find
out if somebody is being held captive. He wants to
find out if these are the same people who did some
other crime that's immediately taking place, what's the
relationship. There are all kinds of interrogation.
You're saying that all that interrogation by a
policeman can't come in under the Confrontation Clause.
MR. GORNSTEIN: The Confrontation Clause bars
under Crawford police interrogation. And the -- the
situation is one in which we are not going to be able
to examine the individual motives of officers in every
case and individual declarants in every case.
What we are looking for is a categorical rule
that is going to capture the likely motivations in both
cases, and when you have emergency question, you're
likely dealing with the situation with -- both from the
officer's side and from the declarant's side, you're
going to be having people attempting to resolve an
immediate danger of harm. And you get --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that assumes -- this
-- your -- your focus on whether the -- you know, the
-- it's an interrogation or not -- it -- it assumes
that the only focus of the Confrontation Clause is on
prosecutorial abuse somehow. And -- and as -- as
Justice Souter was suggesting, I don't think that was
the exclusive --
MR. GORNSTEIN: No, we don't -- we don't
think that's the exclusive focus either, and we think
interrogation can capture both, too, that when you get
to the point of interrogation, what's happening with
the witness is getting an increasing understanding that
what this is being sought for is to build a case.
I think the biggest problem with the -- the
two rules that are proposed on the other side, that is,
the accusation rule and the reasonable anticipation
rule, is it captures within a -- these emergency
statements that really don't have -- fall within any
ordinary understanding of what testimony is. If I go
to my house and it's late at night, I hear suspicious
noises, and I see somebody and get a partial
description of him, and I call 911, I'm seeking to
avert an immediate danger to myself. I don't think
under any stretch of the imagination anybody would
refer to that as testimony. Yet, under his rule --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the Sixth
Amendment doesn't use the word testimony, does it?
MR. GORNSTEIN: No, it does not. But what
the Court said in Crawford was that the term witness
was referring to -- that people can make testimonial
statements --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And maybe that -- and
maybe you're not a witness when you make the call, but
when that same call is admitted into court, then --
then it strikes me that you are a witness.
MR. GORNSTEIN: But -- but that's not the
definition of witness that -- that Crawford adopted.
That would be --
JUSTICE SCALIA: As it happens in the other
-- in the companion case today, the prosecution itself,
in its summation to the jury, referred to the 911 call
and said, you have heard the testimony of -- of the
victim and referred to it as testimony.
MR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Scalia, if he --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's not beyond the
pale to consider this testimony.
MR. GORNSTEIN: -- if -- if he -- he had made
a statement about a co-conspirator's statement during
the course of the conspiracy and he had said, we have
here the testimony of the -- his co-conspirator, that
would not make it testimony. And if the -- the 911
call --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it would prove that
-- that it's not beyond the pale to call it testimony.
MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, it just does not make
it testimony. And if it -- the prosecutor in the 911
case had said, I don't have her testimony, I have
something better, it's a 911 call --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gornstein?
MR. GORNSTEIN: -- of a cry for help, that
wouldn't make it not testimony. And I don't think --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gornstein, is this a
fair summary of your position, if I may? We're really
asking who's the witness that's being testified
against, and when it's the affidavit, it's clearly the
woman that's a witness there where it's inadmissible.
But your view, as I understand you, is when it's the
officer who is the witness, he's subject to cross
examination, and as long as the emergency continues and
he's describing what happened during the emergency,
he's still the witness. That's what you're saying, I
think.
MR. GORNSTEIN: He's -- he's still a --
JUSTICE STEVENS: He's still the witness
we're concerned about.
MR. GORNSTEIN: He is the witness --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Therefore, he's subject to
cross examination.
MR. GORNSTEIN: He's the -- he's the -- he is
subject to cross examination.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And so during the emergency
period, he can repeat what she said.
MR. GORNSTEIN: But I -- what I'm saying is
that she's not a witness during the emergency period
itself.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand what you're
saying.
MR. GORNSTEIN: It has to be both.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That we focus not on
whether it's testimony but whether he's the witness at
the critical time or whether she's the witness.
MR. GORNSTEIN: I -- I think that that's one
way of looking at it, Justice Stevens, but --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not the way
the Court looked at it in Crawford.
MR. GORNSTEIN: No. I -- I think that what
you would look to see is if, at the relevant time, that
-- that the declarant was acting as a witness. And at
the relevant time, when somebody is answering a
question to avert an immediate danger, they're not
acting as a witness. They're not making a solemn
declaration for the purpose of proving facts to support
a prosecution, and so they're not acting as a witness
in those circumstances.
And -- and it's only later, when the officer
turns to soliciting from Ms. Hammon an affidavit, that
what he's soliciting at that point is a solemn
declaration made for the purpose of proving facts to
support a prosecution. Now, that's testimony.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that the two
were -- were as separated as you -- as you claim. I --
I took it that the affidavit -- while he was getting
the oral responses, he was writing down what -- what
would be put in the affidavit.
MR. GORNSTEIN: I don't think that there's
any evidence in the record to support that, Justice
Scalia. That -- that -- what happened is that he took
-- that he listened to her oral statement and then he
proceeded to ask for -- her for an affidavit, after he
had the information that he needed to resolve the
emergency, was to figure out how he was going to
protect this person from an immediate renewed attack if
he left the scene.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But under your test, the
whole question is whether the emergency continued at
the time the witness' words are being repeated.
MR. GORNSTEIN: It's not the whole question
because if the statement -- the question has nothing to
do with and the answer had nothing to do with the
emergency. It does not come in under the rule we're
talking about.
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm not arguing that.
I'm trying to figure out -- I think I have a little
different angle on it than you actually said in your
brief or actually in the text of Crawford. Of course,
Crawford wasn't confronting this problem. It described
everything as testimonial, but the real question is
who's the witness under the text of the Constitution.
MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, Justice Stevens, I'm --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And I think your argument
is --
MR. GORNSTEIN: -- I'm happy to have your
approach if it -- if it leads to five votes in this
case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I think I'm trying to help
you.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE STEVENS: I know it didn't start out
that way, but it seems to me I'm helping your side of
it. Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Gornstein.
Mr. Friedman, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I think that whenever
there is a -- an out-of-court accusation repeated,
there is a witness in court, but that is not the
witness that -- or that doesn't satisfy the
confrontation right because there's the -- the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but you would agree
that the officer could testify to some of the things
that happened during the emergency, and he's a witness
to that extent.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes, absolutely, the officer
was --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And the question is whether
he can cover this as well.
MR. FRIEDMAN: That's -- that, of course, is
the -- that -- that's the question. But -- but she was
acting as a -- a witness when -- when she made the
accusation to -- to the officer, and characterizing it
as an emergency I don't think helps anything in -- in
this case.
The -- the fact is that if we extend the
emergency this far it shows -- well, it shows just how
capable of expansion the -- the theory is because there
is an officer with her and there is an officer with --
with him. So the -- the only question is should the
officers leave. That means that whenever there's --
there's a victim potentially at large there, the
confrontation right wouldn't -- wouldn't apply.
The -- the whole emergency doctrine really
distorts incentives because a -- a police officer who
has a -- a dual motive of creating -- of protecting
people, protecting the safety of -- of people and
gathering evidence -- and I think it's clear that they
do -- under an emergency doctrine, would have an
incentive to preserve the emergency or the appearance
of emergency for -- for as long as -- for as long as
possible. And I -- I think the -- the State encourages
people to call, which of course they should do, but in
part the reason why people are encouraged to call is to
-- is to create -- is to pass on -- is to pass on
evidence.
So I don't think that even if -- even to the
extent that the call is a -- a cry for help, well, the
help is -- is seeking invitation of the -- of the legal
system. In the Davis case, of course, it was an
arrest.
In -- in this case, the -- the statement was
not a cry for help. It was in response to the second
inquiry by the police officer. The police officer was
-- was pressing. And -- and I -- I think the -- the
emergency doctrine simply -- simply can't -- if -- if
there were an emergency doctrine, I think it's just
badly founded and couldn't apply here.
If it please the Court, I believe Crawford
has brought us to a remarkable crossroads. If the
accusation in this case is allowed to secure a
conviction without the State providing an opportunity
for confrontation, then the Confrontation Clause will
be little more than a charade, easily evated by State
officers gathering evidence. But if the Court
proclaims that a conviction cannot be based on an
accusation made privately to a known police officer,
then it will take a long step to ensure that the
confrontation right remains robust, as the Framers
intended for centuries to come.
JUSTICE BREYER: What about the resemblance
idea to get around your problem? Of course, it's not
purely formal. It's purely formal, plus those things
that resemble what's purely formal.
MR. FRIEDMAN: I'm not sure I quite
understand.
JUSTICE BREYER: Listen -- it's purely the formal
criteria, plus anything that's the same. Now, same is
vague, but it's no vaguer than a lot of other things
floating around here today.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: So what do you think of
that?
MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I -- not much, Your
Honor.
(Laughter.)
MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I don't think an
accusation to a known law enforcement officer is
awfully vague. Any legal term will have some -- some
vagueness around the edges, but I don't think there's
much.
Resemblance is awfully vague. I think what
happened here resembled the inquisitorial practices in
the key -- in the key -- in a key respect. And I don't
think the test Your Honor is proposing handles the
message over the Internet or -- or a letter, the -- the
tape made at the initiative of the -- of the witness.
I think it -- it utterly fails to get that because the
-- the prosecutors aren't involved. But clearly the
Confrontation Clause was written against the backdrop
of private prosecution, the system of private
prosecution. So it has to get those clauses.
I -- I think that this case can be resolved
on those very narrow grounds without trying to
establish the broad, general meaning of the
Confrontation Clause. I'm -- I'm hoping that the Court
is building a framework for hundreds of years to -- to
come, and I think it's more important that it be built
right than that it be built quickly. And so I think an
important first step is to say an accusation to a known
police officer, whatever else is testimonial, that
clearly must be.
If there are no further questions, I'm
pleased to submit the case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
