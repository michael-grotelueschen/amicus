CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Our last case this

Technologies.
Mr. Panner?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PANNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The text of the Patent Act and this Court's
precedence answer the question that is properly before
this Court.  There is no liability for indirect
infringement under Section 271(b) unless the defendant
-- defendant has deliberately brought about actionable
direct infringement under Section 271(a).  And that
conclusion is strongly reinforced by the principle that
the patent laws best promote the legitimate interests of
inventors, of the innovative community, and the public
when rules and boundaries are clear.
The Patent Act draws a clear distinction
between conduct that invades a patentee's exclusive
rights and conduct that gives rise to secondary or
indirect liability.  And this Court has consistently
refused to blur those statutory lines simply because a
patent owner complains of supposed unfairness in a
particular case.  Instead, it is for Congress to make
adjustments as it did, for example, in response to this
Court's decision in Deepsouth.  It is likewise
critically important for the scope of patent claims to
be clear so that the public has clear notice of the
patentee's exclusive rights and as between a patentee
who can choose the language to embody the invention and
the public, legal rules should place the obligation on
the patentee to define clearly the scope of what is
invented.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Panner, is this -- is
this a problem that's special to business method patents
as opposed to, say, product?
MR. PANNER:  I think it is a problem that
arises with method patents, Your Honor.  It wouldn't
necessarily be exclusively within business method
patents.  But I do think that it has arisen more often
in circumstances where there are interactions among
various individuals carrying out steps of what would be
called a business method in many cases.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, should the rule be
different for a method patent than a device patent?
MR. PANNER:  Well, I don't think the rule is
different, Your Honor.  The part --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's because the statute
isn't different, I assume.
MR. PANNER:  That's exactly right, Your
Honor.  And -- and, of course, it's -- it's true that
method patents have, in some ways, more restricted
rights associated with them.  It's hard to -- you don't
make a method or sell a method, but you -- you use a
method by carrying out each and every step of that
method.  And it's very well-established and it's one
reflection of the all elements rule, which is, again,
very old, that one doesn't have infringement unless all
the -- all the steps of the patent are carried out.
Now, that's the rule that the Federal
Circuit applied in finding that there was no
infringement -- direct infringement under Section
271(a).  That issue is not properly before the Court at
this point because it was the subject of a
cross-petition that has not been granted.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your -- your
position makes it pretty easy to -- to get around patent
protection, doesn't it?  All you've got to do is find
one step in the process and essentially outsource it or
-- or make it attractive for someone else to perform
that particular step and you've essentially invalidated
the patent.
MR. PANNER:  I don't think so, Your Honor.
In -- in the following -- in -- in two following senses.
First of all, empirically speaking, there have not been
very many cases in which this has proven to be a
problem.  It has been a long -- long understood
principle of patent claim drafting that method claims
should be drafted from the point of view of a potential
infringer so that all of the steps can be carried out by
that potential infringer.  And prospectively,
certainly -- and given that this rule has been clearly
articulated by the Federal Circuit now for many years,
or at least several years, prospectively, the patent
applicant has every incentive to draft claims from the
point of view of a single potential infringer.
This -- the claim that's at issue here,
there's no dispute.  It could have been written in such
a way that the steps would have been carried out by a
single infringer and, indeed, that may have been the
intent.  What the inventor had in mind may well have
been --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it would
be -- when you say it would be written that way, it
would be by not claiming one step in the method, I
assume, which changes the whole patent.
MR. PANNER:  Well, it would be -- it would
be to claim what is carried out from the point of view
of the potential infringer.  So, for example, in this
case what the method claim could have been written to
say, rather than to tag an embedded object, to deliver
an embedded object in response to a request for that
object where -- wherein the request --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you don't know
really in every patent whether the tagging is an
important part of the process or not.
MR. PANNER:  Well, by -- by definition, Your
Honor, the -- every step is material and important to
the invention.  That is really very deeply -- deeply
engrained in the patent law, that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what
you're saying.  You're saying that you can avoid the
problem if the patent is drawn in such a way as what, to
-- to require a single person to do all the steps?
MR. PANNER:  Well, it is -- it's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How does that give you any
more protection?  I mean, you can still violate the
patent by not having one person do all the steps; have
another person do some of the steps.  And -- and -- it's
-- it's just as effective in -- in -- in stealing the
idea and yet there would not be a violation of the
patent.
MR. PANNER:  Your Honor, I -- I would take
issue with that because I don't think that that's --
first of all, to the extent that one is being -- one is
using an agent where there would be a vicarious
liability for that conduct --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  Then, of course.  But
we're not talking about agents.  We're talking about
somebody who simply cooperates with you.  He's not your
agent.
MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, that reflects
-- that reflects the -- a very well-settled principles
of patent law, including the principle that the alleged
-- the defendant must carry out every step of the
patent.  It reflects the fact that where there is
attribution of conduct -- if you have a circumstance --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  I agree with you.  I
mean, I'm not -- I'm not arguing about that.  I'm just
-- I'm just arguing about whether the -- the safe haven
you have given us for -- for patentees really exists.
It doesn't seem to me you can avoid the problem by
simply requiring all the steps to be conducted by -- by
one person.
MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, in -- in my
experience in -- in terms of dealing with patents that
are written to technologies that do involve interaction,
for example, between cellular phones and networks and
content providers who are sending content to a phone,
for example, it is very common to draft claims from the
point of view of someone who's participating in that
process so that all of the steps will be carried out in
that -- by that person.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that what the briefs
are talking about as a single actor rule?
MR. PANNER:  Yeah.  It would -- it's
referred to sometimes as a single entity rule.  I think
that's a little bit of a misnomer because, of course,
there could be multiple people involved with the alleged
infringement in a circumstance where the acts of one
actor are attributable to the principal, under
principles of vicarious liability.
And, you know, if there were a concern,
Justice Scalia, about the -- the potential for evasion,
that's something that Congress can address.
Essentially, the rule that is being --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say this isn't here
anyway, right?
MR. PANNER:  That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  And 11 of the 12
judges on the Federal Circuit agreed with your position
on the thing, I gather, or something like that.
MR. PANNER:  Well, 10 of 11.  Just to be
clear, I don't want to overstate.  The majority below
did not purport to address this question.  It said that
it was leaving in place prior law which establishes this
position.  The dissent expressly adopted it and then
there was one -- one judge below who indicated her
disagreement.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So how many out
of -- out of how many?  Maybe -- maybe that's why we
didn't grant the cross-petition.
MR. PANNER:  It may well be, Your Honor.  It
may well be.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the parties
briefed -- this case tends to be rather confusing
because didn't the parties brief, what is it, 271(1)
or -- and then the Federal Circuit decided it on sub
(2).
MR. PANNER:  So, Your Honor, that is --
that's accurate.  What happened in the case, just to go
over quickly the -- the procedural history, Akamai moved
for rehearing from the panel decision.  Akamai had
pursued their case as a direct infringement case under
271(a).  The Federal Circuit granted that en banc
petition.  They subsequently granted an en banc petition
in a case involving McKesson and Epic, and that case did
present a question of indirect infringement under
Section 271(b).  And when the Federal Circuit heard the
case, therefore, they had the -- the -- you know, 271
more broadly before them and they decided the case on
the grounds of 271(b), which was -- and then they
offered Akamai the benefit of -- of that decision and
that's why we petitioned for -- for certiorari.  And the
cross-petition was prompted by their dissatisfaction
with the 271(a) rule that was applied by the panel.  But
I do --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I understand.  And --
and perhaps I'm just confused.  I thought the issue we
granted cert on was whether you could have an inducement
of infringement if no one is directly infringing.
MR. PANNER:  That's exactly right, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So -- so the
question the Federal Circuit below didn't deal with did
someone directly infringe at all?
MR. PANNER:  The -- the en banc court did
not, Your Honor.  The panel decided it and the en banc
court chose not to disturb that.  And so I do agree with
Your Honor that there's a straight -- that there's a
very straightforward path to this Court reversing this
case on the question that's properly presented by our
petition, which is to say simply that under the plain
language of Section 271(b), that if there is no direct
infringement -- actionable direct infringement under
1(a), that there is no liability.  And that's a very
straightforward --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that direct
infringement question would still be open before the
court below?
MR. PANNER:  Potentially, Your Honor, yes.
We would certainly -- we don't think it's a cert-worthy
question, and we would urge -- we have urged the Court
to deny the petition -- the cross-petition, but --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And how would it --
just to follow up, how would it still be open for the
court below?  It was decided; en banc review was not
granted?  Isn't that done?
MR. PANNER:  Well, en banc review actually
was granted, Your Honor, because the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  On -- on the direct
infringement question?
reach it?
MR. PANNER:  Yes, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And they just didn't
MR. PANNER:  Correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, Mr. Panner, if they did
reach it a second time around and they decided well, now
that this inducement theory is not available to us, we
think that there is a real problem here, that there is a
kind of end run around the patent law and so we're going
to change what we think on the 271(a) question, if they
did that, would be right to say it would render our
opinion on the 271(b) question a nullity?
MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, it is --
that -- that may be right in the -- in the following
sense.  That it's often true that this Court will take a
question where there's an underlying prior legal ruling
that the Court doesn't choose to review or doesn't
disturb.  And it's -- in any circumstance like that,
it's true that there's a potential that the prior rule
might later be disturbed and then that would alter
the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  I guess the question
I'm asking -- I mean, I can't think of a way in which
our decision on the 271(b) question would be relevant
for any case if the Federal Circuit on remand goes the
opposite way in a -- on the 271(a) question.  But maybe
I'm not thinking more broadly enough.
MR. PANNER:  I don't think so, Your Honor,
because if -- if the Court were to keep -- if the Court
were to maintain that rule -- if the Court were to
affirm the rule that the Federal Circuit articulated,
that might reach circumstances -- that would continue to
potentially provide an avenue for claims of induced
infringement and circumstances where on some
hypothetical new joint infringement doctrine under
Section 271(a), there might not be a claim.
So in other words --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  I suppose I just
couldn't think of a place where somebody would make the
271(b) claim if the 271(a) claim were available to it.
MR. PANNER:  Your Honor, that's probably
right, and that's a very good reason that the -- for the
Court to recognize that the Section 271(b) ruling is
incorrect.  It essentially swallows -- or I should
say -- let me back up.  It's a good reason to recognize
that Akamai's theory about Section 271(a), that 271(a)
ought to be expanded.  Now, I realize that's not -- not
before the Court and we're not asking the Court to reach
that, of course.
JUSTICE ALITO:  It's -- it's a good reason
to think that the question before us really has no
significance that I can think of unless the -- the Court
of Appeals -- unless the Federal Circuit is right about
(a).
MR. PANNER:  Well, again, Your Honor, it
certainly --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So you're asking us to
decide a question -- to assume the answer to the
question on (a) and then decide a question on (b) that
is of no value -- no significant -- maybe I don't
understand some other -- I don't see some other
situations where it would apply, and no significance
unless the ruling on (a) stands, unless Muniauction is
correct?
MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, again, I
think that there's -- there are -- there might be
circumstances where Section 271(a) would still -- still
not apply and there might be an argument that, depending
on what the more -- we're talking about a hypothetical
271(a) rule that's broader, and we don't know what it
would look like and so whether that would leave room for
271(b).
It is certainly correct that if this Court
were to say there is no indirect liability under Section
271(b), as we would urge the Court to do, without direct
infringement under 271(a), that resolves this question.
Whether there would be further development under 271(a),
we would certainly urge the Federal Circuit not to
change the rules.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I just want to make
clear, you're saying that under existing law, the
question presented makes a huge difference; if existing
law is changed, it may not make a difference?
MR. PANNER:  That's exactly right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose that's
true in every case we hear.
MR. PANNER:  That's -- that's well said,
Your Honor.  Thank you.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I suppose, Mr. Panner,
what might make this a little bit different is that
notwithstanding what you said about 10 of 11 judges, it
was clear that the judges thought that there was a real
problem here in terms of an end run, and that they
looked at this and said, well we could do it under
271(a) or we could do it under 271(b), and 271(b) seems
a lot more natural and better for various reasons.  But
your sense in reading the opinion that all those judges
who did it under 271(b) are just going to go back and do
the exact same thing under 271(a).
MR. PANNER:  I -- I certainly wouldn't agree
with that, Your Honor.  I think that the fact that
liability under 271(a) would actually be somewhat of a
disaster for the innovative community because of the
breadth of a strict liability claim under Section
271(a).  That's precisely why -- absolutely on a policy,
you know, based on a policy judgment.  But that's the
reason that the -- the decision should be reversed.  The
Federal Circuit did make a policy judgment, tried to
amend the statute to reach a result that they thought
was fair in the particular case.  That's a job for
Congress.
Could I reserve the remainder of my time?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You could.
MR. PANNER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Anders.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS
FOR UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MS. ANDERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Federal Circuit's holding that a party
may be liable for inducing infringement under Section
271(b), even though no one has committed direct
infringement, is wrong for two primary reasons.  First,
Section 271(b)'s text makes clear that to be liable for
inducement, a party must induce conduct that constitutes
direct infringement under 271(a).  And second, I think
in expanding 271(b), the Federal Circuit departed from
the approach that this Court has -- has repeatedly
employed in interpreting Section 271.
I think the Federal Circuit was
understandably concerned about allowing inducers to
perform some steps of a process themselves to escape
liability, but this Court has twice held in both
Microsoft v. AT&T and before that Deep South v. Laitram
that judicial concerns about gaps in 271's coverage
should not drive the Court's interpretation of that
provision.  That is because any time that you close a
gap in 271, expanding patent rights, you are invariably
implicating competing policy concerns and it's for Congress to
resolve those concerns.
So to go to the -- the concern about
circumvention, I think if Congress were just considering
the -- the traditional active inducer who simply induces
a party to perform all the steps of a process, that
person compared to someone who performs some steps
himself and induces someone else to perform the rest of
the steps, there's no obvious policy reason to
distinguish between those two actors.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there any policy reason
for -- that could support a holding, if you were -- if
you were in Congress, support the conclusion that there
would -- there was not infringement on the facts here?
MS. ANDERS:  Under 271(b), I think the --
JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  I mean, if you were
writing a statute.  If you were amending -- you said
there are competing policy concerns.  What are the --
what policy concerns would support a holding -- a conclusion
that there was no infringement on the facts here?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think the -- the
concern that comes from expanding 271(b), I think, is --
is ably represented by the Internet service providers,
the wireless providers, the software --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is she talking about (b) or
(a)?  I thought the question went to (a).  And you're
answering (b).
MS. ANDERS:  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I was –
JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe I’m wrong.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I don't care.  (A) or
(b), whatever, or (c) or (d) or (z).
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO:  What policy concern -- what
policy concern would support the -- the conclusion that
there is an infringement on the facts of this case?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think one of the
concerns is that if you expand inducement so that --
someone only has to induce one step of a process --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I think what he's saying,
is there any good reason that they aren't liable for
infringement?  Is that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  Exactly.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And I thought
the reason -- you have to answer it -- is because when
you have many steps in a process, and this is a very
similar process of the book I'm reading now about the
Seabees building constructions in World War II, you
know, they put some forward warehouses and they put some
other stuff in some other warehouses and they make the
eventual thing by shipping this from over there and the
other place.  So it's tough.
Now, you’ll probably want to insist upon a
pretty strict relationship between the different parties
in a joint venture or more before you hold them liable.
In other words, there's an issue I don't know about.
How close was this relationship?  And I ask you that
because you're going to answer his question and I want
to just see if my stab in the dark here is somewhere
close to the -- to what you were about to say.
MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think that's right,
Justice Breyer.  I think if you look at this as a
problem under 271(a), which, again, is not the question
before the Court, but if you do, what everyone agrees, I
think, is that you can use traditional, well-established
tort principles of attribution in order to conclude that
someone who has not personally performed all the steps
of a process, nonetheless, should be liable for using
the process because they have worked in concert with
someone else.  I think everyone agrees on that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but that is not the
tort rule for what this is, which is an absolute
liability.  I mean, you asked for the policy reason.
The policy reason is someone who does not even know
about the existence of the -- of the patent, who happens
to be one of the people who -- who performs one or more
of the -- of the steps is suddenly automatically liable.
That's -- that's the policy reason.  It's a strict
liability tort.
MS. ANDERS:  I think that's absolutely the
reason that we -- I think we would all agree that --
that if you had two unrelated parties who each happen to
use some steps of a process, happened to perform some
steps, unbeknownst to each other, we wouldn't say that
those people had used the process in any reasonable
construction of the term.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, even knownst -- even
knownst to each other, but -- but one of them who is
knownst doesn't know about the patent.  He would still
be liable, wouldn't he?
MS. ANDERS:  It depends on what tort
principles you would use under 271(a).  But I think that
is a significant concern and it is one that this Court
would have to take into account in deciding what tort
principles to incorporate in 271(a).
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute, I think under
Justice Scalia's example, they're not liable today,
because if they're -- if they're on the method patent,
someone has to practice the four steps, and they have to
be vicariously liable, correct?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think the rule is that
you either have to practice all of the steps yourself --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right.
MS. ANDERS:  -- or you have to have them
attributed to you under traditional tort principles of
attribution.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right.  Exactly.
MS. ANDERS:  The Federal Circuit has said
principal agent right now.  That rule makes sense.  I
think everyone agrees that that rule, at least, is
correct.  If the Court wanted to broaden that out, it
would have to consider, I think, the significant concern
about expanding liability too far so that you have
parties who don't know about the patent, who don't know
exactly what steps they need to perform or avoid
performing in order to avoid liability.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But in some ways that's why
the Federal Circuit did what it did, right?  I mean, you
can look at the Federal Circuit's ruling and say it
makes no sense.  How can you induce infringement if
there's no infringement in the first place.  And that's
a very strong argument.  But the reason they put this
under 271(b) rather than under 271(a) is because of what
Justice Scalia said, that 271(b) is not a strict
liability offense, and so that you can say, you have to
know and you have to have instructed the -- the person.
So, you know, they thought that they were being very
clever by putting it into a 271(b) box and avoiding the
strict liability consequences of what they were doing,
but also avoiding the possibility of an end run of the
patent law.
MS. ANDERS:  I think that's right.  I think
another reason the Federal Circuit might not want --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And also avoiding the text
of the statute.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN:  There is that problem.
There is -- There is that problem.
(Laughter.)
MS. ANDERS:  Right.  I think the problem
under 271(a) for the Federal Circuit was that
well-established tort doctrines don't support
attribution liability when you have a vendor customer.
So it turned to 271(b).  The problem with 271(b), as
Justice Scalia said, is that it's very clear from the
text of the statute that the conduct induced has to be
direct infringement.
And I think the Court has twice before
confronted situations where there was conduct that
clearly was intended to circumvent the Patent Act.  In
both Microsoft v. AT&T and Deepsouth, it was very clear
that what -- what the defendant was trying to do was
ship operations overseas so that it could avoid the
Patent Act.  And in both of those cases, the Court
reversed lower court decisions that had used that desire
to stop circumvention as the primary driver of its
interpretation of the Act.  So in both cases, the Court
said, to be liable under 271, you have to satisfy the
requirements of 271.  We are not going to interpret the
text simply to avoid circumvention concerns, even when,
you know, you would say, if you were looking from the
perspective of the patentee, that essentially their --
their patent had been performed.
In both cases, the Court said it is for
Congress to make that judgment because there will always
be countervailing policy concerns.  And I think --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Anders, will you
clarify if the government, which has now told us what
its position is on sub (b) also has a position on sub
(a), which is what the Federal Circuit originally
decided this case under?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think -- we haven't
briefed that question.  I think we -- if the Court were
to decide that issue, we think it probably should order
further briefing.  But I would say three things about
it, which I think are relevant both to why we think the
Court shouldn't decide the issue in this case and
relevant to our view of the merits.
The first is that, as we've been discussing,
the 271(a) issue, I think, raises a very different legal
question than the 271(b) issue.  271(a) turns on what
the -- the content and application of well-established
tort doctrines.  I think there's substantial
disagreement about what the content of those doctrines
are and how they would apply here, which would, I think,
need to be decided by looking at treaties, state law,
how these doctrines have been applied.
That relates to the second point, which I
think is that these tort doctrines, properly applied, we
don't think apply easily to the vendor-customer
situation.  There is no agreement to circumvent the
patent.  There's no common pecuniary interest of the
sort that courts have looked for when they've looked at
joint enterprise cases or conspiracy cases.  So I
think -- you know, although one of the most -- the
pressing policy concern, I think, it addressed or raised
by the other side's amici is this idea of two people
agreeing to circumvent a patent.
I don't think that situation can easily be
resolved here because we have a vendor-customer
situation here, and so I think the Court could, I think,
resolve that question in a future case.
And the final thing I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I -- I have one
last question.  In your brief, and I think your
adversary -- your -- Mr. Panner mentioned it, too.
You said that there's some kind of method
patents that simply cannot be drafted from the
perspective of a single entity.  Could you give me an
example?  And -- and how that would be circumvented or
how you can't get it circumvented.
MS. ANDERS:  It's hard to give a very
concrete example, but I think patents that involve the
use of -- of different machines that have to be operated
by two people might be an example.  And I think even --
even if you draft patents from the perspective of a
single actor, it's always theoretically possible for --
for different actors to split up the claims or split up
the steps of the process to use them together.  But we
think that's one thing that Congress should consider in
deciding what the rules should be here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You had a third
point you were going to make on 271(a)?
MS. ANDERS:  The third point was just
something that I think we already alluded to a little
bit, which is that, when the Court is deciding what --
what tort doctrines to import into 271(a), I think
there's a lot of reason for caution because if -- if you
expand the doctrines too much and you use doctrines that
don't require a whole lot of knowledge, then you are
going to increase uncertainty and litigation burdens and
ultimately chill innovation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
Mr. Waxman?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Please make no mistake about what Limelight
is asking you to do.  Under Limelight's theory, two or
more people can divide up and perform the steps of any
method claim, however drafted, without liability.
Imagine, for example, to go to the question -- Justice
Ginsburg's question about business method patents,
imagine a pretty common medical treatment claim.  Let's
assume that there is disclosure and patenting of a cure
for cancer or a novel treatment for cancer that
involves, as they often do, the administration of
different drugs sequentially.  And two parties get
together and say, I'll administer Drug 1, you administer
Drug 2, and we can take advantage of this marvelous
patented process without paying anything -- giving
anything whatsoever to the company that spent a billion
dollars and 25 years developing this.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that a
partnership?
MR. WAXMAN:  Excuse me?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that a
partnership?
MR. WAXMAN:  It would not necessarily be a
partnership.  I mean, the fact of the matter is,
that's -- there's no reason why it would have to be.  We
don't have to have a formal partnership.  We don't have
to have a formal --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's nothing in the
law that requires a formal partnership.
MR. WAXMAN:  This is exactly, exactly the
point here, which is that as this Court has taught, the
Patent Act, and in particular 271(a), imports common law
principles of liability unless the law, the Patent Act
clearly can be read to exclude them.  And the whole
fight here, if you'll pardon me, on the 271(a) question,
which is a predicate question to the 271(b) question, as
it was in Arrow and Deepsouth and the Sony Betamax case,
the 271(a) question is just which common law rules of
attribution apply?
Now, the Court -- the panel below said,
well, we know -- there are only two rules that apply.
One is if there is a binding contractual obligation by
each party to perform all the joint steps.  And two, if
there is a formal agency principal relationship.  Those
two are correct.
At common law, there was attribution for
tort liability, whether it was strict negligence or
intentional, under those circumstances, but -- and you
can consult any of the treatises that we cite at pages
25 through 27 of our brief -- there were all -- there
also was a well -- there were well-recognized
attribution doctrine that applied where there was
direction and control.  That is, one party directed or
controlled the other, which is the basis on which the
jury found liability here, and also where the parties
were engaged in a concerted action or a common plan.
And, Justice Scalia, to your point about,
you know, people could be inadvertently liable, even if
they didn't know about all the steps or they didn't know
each other, the common law didn't accommodate those
circumstances.  The common law required, across tort
law, whether a strict liability tort law like trespass,
libel, conversion, patent infringement, required not
that you know about and intend to violate the patent,
but in order to be -- have another party's conduct
attributed to you, you had to know about the other
party's conduct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think there's -- there's
disagreement about whether only those two, namely agency
or -- what's the other?
MR. WAXMAN:  Contractual obligation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Contractual obligation,
whether only those two at common law would apply to
strict liability torts.  There's disagreement on that
point.  If you're absolutely clear that that's what the
common law did, but I don't think that's what the common
law did.
MR. WAXMAN:  You know, let me just say --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not for strict liability torts.
MR. WAXMAN:  Let me just say, Justice
Scalia, that the proposition that they've asserted, and
I gather that you're giving -- you're crediting in their
reply brief, that where the underlying tort is strict
liability, the attribution rules have to be these formal
nonknowledge rules.  They don't have -- they have not
cited a single case in support of that proposition.
There is no logical reason why it would necessarily be
true, and I can give you cases that suggest -- that
quite definitely suggest the other, including a patent
case that all the parties have been -- Liddy have been
writing about, which is Jackson vs. Nagle.
That was a case in which there was an
infringement of a method patent where some of the steps
were performed by a contractor and some of the steps
were performed by the subcontractor, and there is no
respondeat superior in the common law for
contractor/subcontractor relationship.  The Court found
them both individually liable, even though neither
completed all the steps under what the Court called
principles of joint liability.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, under your
submission in a process patent, if the consumer adds the
final step, vast numbers of consumers, and let's assume
they have noticed -- they've been notified that they
can't do this, then there's liability.
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I mean, look, before I
came here this morning, using my smartphone, I'm sure
that technically I performed the last step of probably
15 different method patents.  Consumers aren't sued
under patent law for infringement, whether there's a
single user or multiple users.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yet, until we issue the
case in your favor.
MR. WAXMAN:  No, no, not at all.  Quite to
the contrary.  The consumer -- first of all, consumers
aren't sued, because under the patent law, under like --
under -- unlike copyright law, there are no liquidated
damages.  No one sues individual consumers.
The consumers, the customers in this case
are big companies like Microsoft and CNN and ESPN who
operate these websites using the patented method through
Limelight services.
But more to the point here, Justice Kennedy,
the point is that there -- at common law, there was no
liability absent knowledge about who was doing all of
the other steps.  And that was the protection that
existed.  You could always send a letter to people
saying, You may not have known about it in the past, but
now you know about it.  That rendering plant that you
built turns out to be part of a -- together with many
other pollution-emitting sources constitutes a nuisance,
a strict liability, often a strict liability crime.  And
now that you know about it, you're liable.  And
that's -- that was the law.  That was the rule.
But I think the consequences here to
consumers, if you're talking about consumers rather than
the -- the parties that knowingly, under Limelight's
direction, performed a critical step in the patented
method, were not traditionally sued.  They were not
traditionally liable, and it was the -- A, the absence
of -- of knowledge of what everybody else was doing.
I mean, the consumer in your hypothetical,
Justice Kennedy, may get a letter saying, Well, we have
a patent on, you know, what Nokia's phone does, and
you're infringing it.  At common law, there would be no
attribution to you of all the steps that -- of what
Nokia was otherwise doing, unless you knew specifically
the specific steps of the claim method that were being
patented.
And so in this whole discussion about, you
know, is the only question before the Court 271(b), or
is there 271(a) imported, I'm going to leave to side the
question of whether you should or shouldn't grant our
pending conditional cross-petition, and assuming you
don't want to do it.
You should address -- I mean, you could
affirm the Federal Circuit on the theory that it
adopted, and I am prepared to defend it because I think
it was correct.
But at a minimum, we think in order to
provide a full analysis under 271(b) and to provide,
heaven knows, much needed guidance in this area -- and
let me just say that Mr. Panner is brilliant, but his
math on the court below is wrong.  There were four
judges on the En Banc Court who disagreed with us on
direct liability.  The five in the majority took no
position.  They said that they had no occasion to
address it at this time.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if you don't prevail
on your indirect infringement claim, can you relitigate
the direct infringement case in the -- before the En
Banc Court, or --
MR. WAXMAN:  I think, both the Government
and -- at the petition stage, both the Government and
Limelight took pains to point out that if you simply
reverse and don't grant the cross-petition, the Federal
Circuit will have in front of it the question on which
it granted en banc review and vacated the panel
decision.
But I would go farther.  No matter if you --
if you affirm either on 271 grounds on its own right or
271 grounds using an analysis similar to what you did in
Aro and Deepsouth and the Sony Betamax case, which was
to say, okay, we have a question presented that poses a
question of indirect liability.  But indirect liability
depends on direct liability, and we are not simply going
to assume, for argument's sake, this artificial
assertion that there is no direct liability.  We're
going to look and see in Aro whether the car owner was
engaged in --
JUSTICE BREYER:  My problem is I have no
idea.  I mean --
MR. WAXMAN:  No idea --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I have no idea whether they
should be liable or not on a theory of patent
infringement themselves.  It sounds simple when you take
the invention that you gave, but it doesn't sound simple
to me when I start thinking about this one, because this
one does seem to me a variation on a very old theme.
And that is a supplier who makes customized materials,
some of which involve standardized materials and some of
which have to be made fresh, and where the specialists
are in crowded cities.  But -- and so it takes time to
put it on the truck and get out of the city.
But the standardized parts can be shipped
from anywhere in the country.  Has a system of phoning
up standardized people and customized people and putting
them all together, and it involves the customer.
And there are not just two steps.  There are
87 steps, and many of them involve very innocent things
like taking a truck and driving it from one place to
another.
Now, when we get into something as
complicated as that -- and this is one is even more
so -- and many of them are things that people do every
day, and there are all kinds of states of knowledge, I
become very nervous about writing a rule that suddenly
might lead millions of people to start suing each other.
And that's what I would not like to do unless I have
pretty thorough briefing on this subject.
MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Breyer, let me answer
the question and then -- and get to my -- the point I
was trying to make in response to Justice Kennedy's
question.
This case is not complicated.  This case
involves a four- or five-step method in which Limelight
performs all but one or two of the steps and tells its
customers, if you want to use our service, you have to
perform the other step.  Here's exactly how you do it.
We have somebody 24 hours a day, seven days a week
assigned to you to help make sure you do it the right
way.  And the question in this case is whether that
constitutes, under 271(a), as the jury found and the
judge denied JMOL under the law that existed at the
time, all of the steps were performed at -- the steps --
the step that Limelight's customers performed were at
the direction --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And of course, my problem
is a rule.  And if this is a simple case, it's hard to
me.  Why do they have a patent?  Well, they do have some
forward warehouses and they had -- phone up and say,
which one comes from which place?  But, you see, I don't
understand the underlying stuff.  So they probably have
a valid patent.  I assume that.
But for some of them, could be 87 steps, and
I don't have one rule for four steps and another one for
87.
MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Breyer, just so that
we're clear, in telling -- in urging the Court to
address the predicate question of (a) liability in this
case, we are not suggesting that it would be possible or
appropriate -- well, of course, it's possible --
appropriate for this Court to write a treatise on 271(a)
that deals with all method claims regardless of the
state of knowledge of various parties, many of whom
don't even know about each other.
What we're asking this Court to do is to say
either we affirm on 271(b), or we can't decide or
shouldn't decide the 271(b) question until there is
consideration of the question on which you -- you've --
the basis on which you vacated the panel decision and
granted review.  Because in, as in Lebron -- and this is
a fortiori case from Lebron -- as in Lebron, it's not
satisfying to us as a --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And I'd have the same
question, by the way, as to 271(b), exactly the same
question.  For X number of years, the patent bar and
everyone else has lived with the statute and the
interpretations which are different from this one.  And
now suddenly we have a new one.  And I get the -- and
now do you understand my question?  Can you apply it to
this one, too, and explain why we should say the Federal
Circuit is right to depart from a pretty clear
understanding differently?
MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, I can.  May I just
answer -- finish answering Justice Kennedy's question
before I forget it, which I am greatly in -- in danger
of doing?
The point here, Justice Kennedy, is whether
you would affirm here on 271(b) grounds or (a) grounds,
the result will be exactly the same.  We are not
expanding the relief that we are requesting this Court
to grant, because even if you just affirm on (b), just
say the Federal Circuit was right, either because it's
theory is right or because we think that the common law
attribution rules are broader than the Court -- the
panel previously had thought, the result is going to be
a remand to decide a quest -- the question of
infringement under 154(1) and 271(a) because there -- as
they -- as Limelight points out like on every third page
of its briefs, there is an unresolved pending appellate
challenge to the jury's finding that Limelight's
customers, in fact, practiced the tagging step.
So they are going to have to address on
remand a -- the question of whether or not there is
direct infringement, whether direct infringement
occurred.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Waxman, if -- if --
if we say something about the 271(a) question here, I
mean, it does seem as though it's sandbagging Limelight.
Limelight did not brief this until you briefed it, so we
have part of Limelight's reply brief.  None of the
amicus knew -- the amici knew that it was in the case
until you briefed the 271 issue.  So that would seem a
real problem in getting to the 271 issue here.
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, Justice Kagan, first of
all, I mean, if it were a real problem, the Court could
order supplemental briefing.  It could order, as it did
in Kiobel order supplemental briefing and have a
reargument in the fall either on our cross-petition or
in the predicate question.
But it's not quite as unfair as you think.
The question on which the case was briefed and argued --
the only question briefed and argued by the parties and
22 amici in the Federal Circuit en banc proceedings was
the 271(a) question.  And in response to -- in our
petition papers, we said look, whether you grant our
cross-petition or not, (a) is a predicate question that
the Court should address in order to render a meaningful
decision and do what it did in Aro and Sony Betamax.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  That --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry,
Mr. Waxman.  You tried to dodge Justice Breyer's
question earlier, and I'd like to give you a chance to
respond.
MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  So the question, as I
understand it, is, what's your defense of the Federal
Circuit's rationale for 271(b) liability; is that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And my question is one you
probably can't answer, which is a problem because you
have limited time, and the way -- you have such limited
time in these complicated cases.
And my problem is, the question is this is
so complicated.  And the reasons I found it so
complicated is I can -- and I'll spare you the
details -- think of so many different kinds of
situations with so many different steps in method
patents where so many rights and wrongs of it are
differently at play that I become worried about setting
forth any rule.
And it's under those circumstances that I
say okay, let's go with what we've had for 30 years, and
if Congress feels they should change it, change it.  And
that's the --
MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that -- that is
basically my idea.  And it depends upon the complexity,
which I'm seeing in my -- as -- as I think about it.
MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And it doesn't depend just
upon that there were 4 steps in this case, because there
could have been 104.
MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  I -- I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  There could have been 104
different circumstances.
MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  I understand the
question, and it's -- it's really a hesitation --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. WAXMAN:  -- a concern about saying
anything about (a).
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Well, anything about
(a) and also about (b), because (b), if you're liable
under (b), my goodness, you could become more easily
liable perhaps or less easily in some circumstances, but
you didn't even -- I mean, it's the same question for
(a) and (b).
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, just --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Go with what you have
because I don't understand it well enough to know all
the facts and circumstances to which I would be applying
a new rule.
MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Breyer, if you are
hesitant, and perhaps you should be, to say anything
about (a) or (b) in the utterly peculiar circumstances
of this case litigated judgment on (a), vacation of the
panel decision to have argument and decision on (a) and
then nothing said about (a) except we don't need -- then
the -- then the option for the Court -- it seems to me,
the best option for the Court would be simply to dismiss
the petition as improvidently granted or to vacate on
the grounds that the -- look, you don't ask, you don't
get.  To -- to --
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, sure you do.
MR. WAXMAN:  I'm serious, though, because
the real question in this case that you're grappling
with is -- I mean it would be clearly presented and you
could hear -- you know, get full briefing and argument
about it in the fall on (a) as well as (b) and
ultimately have to decide, but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Waxman, is -- is the
decision that the Federal Circuit made below a new
decision?  Do you have any case that has ever found
inducement where there was not direct inducement --
MR. WAXMAN:  Infringe --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- direct infringement
by someone?
MR. WAXMAN:  That's not our submission.
There's no question that there has --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is a new rule by
the Federal Circuit?
MR. WAXMAN:  I don't -- the principle that
the -- let me -- the answer is no.  What is new is the
2008 -- beginning in 2008 jurisprudence in the Federal
Circuit on 271(a) that unnaturally limited the common
law attribution rules.
The (b) decision is not new because, and I
say this because the principle is certainly as the
majority said below, you cannot have liability for
inducement or contributory infringement unless there is
direct infringement.  That is tautological.  No one
disagrees with that.
Infringement in the Patent Act is defined in
section -- what is now Section 154(a)(1), but was, in
fact, the entire metes and bounds of the patent laws
starting in the Patent Act of 1836, which is that -- and
this Court itself has called it the foundational
definition of infringement.  154(a)(1) says that, a, you
know, a patent holder has the exclusive right to make,
sell, use, or offer to sell his invention during the
term of the patent.  That's what sets out the metes and
bounds of the property right.  And any encroachment on
that property right is a infringement.
And therefore, because there -- the jury
found that all the -- I know there's an outstanding
question on appeal, but the jury found that every step
of -- there was an encroachment in this case, there was
an infringement.  And the common -- the patent law, as
well as the common law, was very, very clear that
whether the underlying conduct was conducted by one
person or two people or three people, the party that
induced those people to do it was liable.
And I would -- if you're asking for
authority, I don't think that there's a better authority
than -- well, I'll give you three really good ones, not
necessarily in order of importance.  The Robinson 1890
treatise on patents which this Court has repeatedly
referred to, says point blank and cites authorities for
that proposition;  so similarly, the Walker treatise; and
finally this Court's decision -- this Court's opinion
last month in United States versus Rosemond, which was a
criminal aiding and abetting case, but in the course of
the -- of the Court's discussion, the Court explains
that look, let's take a kidnapping example and let's say
that someone is abducted, but the abduction occurs as a
result of four people just basically getting together
and saying, you know, you provide the home or the
warehouse --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Waxman, I think it's a
very different situation.  I mean, in that
case it's
clear that there was a kidnapping.  It happened to be a
kidnapping done by four people rather than a kidnapping
done by one person.  But there was a kidnapping.
Now, in your case, I don't think you can say
the same thing because the question is:  Is there an
infringement?  Under Federal Circuit law, there is no
infringement when different people do these different
steps of the process.  That's just the fact of the
matter.
MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I'm on thin ice indeed,
Justice Kagan, in -- in arguing with you or dialoguing
with you about what Rosemond -- the Rosemond opinion
involved.  But let me take a valiant step in any event.
What this Court said was that from the
perspective -- and -- and the two treatises that this
Court cited also say this -- from the perspective of the
victim, which is the perspective that the Court used in
the example and is the perspective that the common law
of torts takes, there was an encroachment upon rights.
Now, what this Court said in its discussion is none of
those four people are liable for kidnapping as a
principal, but they are all liable under the common plan
analysis for indirect liability.  And that is -- this --
what is really most notable about the common law is --
and the early patent cases -- is how assiduously, going
back at least through the 19th Century, the courts
worked to make sure that where there was an invasion of
the property or personal right, either in criminal law
or in civil tort law, that parties that cooperated with
each other or a party that was directing other parties
to do it were held liable whether one person did
elements A, B, C, or D or not.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I think again,
Mr. Waxman, what -- what -- what your argument just
glides over is that you need the infringement.  And the
question is whether, under substantive law, you have the
infringement when different people do different steps of
the process.  And as I understand the Federal Circuit's
law in this area, it's that you don't have any
infringement when different people do different steps of
the process.  So that takes you back to the 271(a)
question, which you think is wrong, but if it's right,
you just don't have an argument in the 271(b) question.
MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Kagan, no.  The Federal
Circuit's law as announced by the majority below is that
you have (b) liability when there is infringement as
defined by 154(1).  And here the patent law and the
common law --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  An infringement without
an infringer.
MR. WAXMAN:  You can certainly have
infringement without an actionable infringer,
absolutely.  Under anybody's rule you can do that.  The
whole debate we have with the other side on the (a)
question is how -- what attribution rules do or don't
apply.  But if you have an example, to take Justice --
one of the things that's bother -- one of the -- one
small part of what's bothering Justice Breyer, you have
a situation where however many steps there are and
however many parties there are, there are some parties
that don't know about each other or what they're doing.
In those circumstances, the common law
doesn't apply liability, and therefore, you would have
an instance in which there could be an infringement
under 154(1) in the sense that all of the steps of the
patented method are performed, but there will be no
liability because the performers were not acting in
concert or at the direction or control of each other.
And that's -- that's why I think what the
Federal Circuit did on its own terms is not novel.  It
accepted the proposition that you can't have inducement
liability unless there is an infringement, unless there
is a tort, and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're making 271(b) a
strict liability crime?
MR. WAXMAN:  No, no, not at all.  I'm sorry,
I -- no, no.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That everybody who
performs -- who performs the steps to get -- if they get
to the patented methods, they have --
MR. WAXMAN:  No, absolutely.  Under
Global-Tech, there's no liability under 271(b) unless
there is an intent by the inducer to, in fact,
violate -- infringe the patent.  So to give you an -- a
prosaic example.  Let's say --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the customer intends
to -- in your example, is the customer intending to
violate the patent?
MR. WAXMAN:  In our example, no.  I mean,
there's no facts here to suggest that -- that
Limelight's customers even -- forget knowing about the
patent, they don't even know what steps Limelight is
taking.  All they know is Limelight is saying, hey, if
you use our service and you provide our pointer or our
-- or our tag, we'll provide you all of this content
instantaneously.  So there is no liability, although
there is liability because there is knowledge on the
part of Limelight which is asking its customers to --
telling its customers to do exactly what Akamai is
asking and telling its customers to do.
So, in short, we think that the Federal
Circuit -- the en banc Federal Circuit is correct even
on its own terms because there was an act of
infringement in this case.  There was infringement in
the sense that all of the steps of the patented method
were performed, whether or not there is an attribution
rule that would apply liability to one or more of those
parties under 271(a).
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does -- what does (b)
require?  Does it require inducing an infringement or
inducing an infringer?
MR. WAXMAN:  Inducing an infringement.  And
I'll give you a concrete example.  Let's say that
there's a five-step patented method that I know about,
and I convince -- I induce Mr. Panner to do steps 1, 2,
and 3 and Ms. Anders to do steps 4 and 5.  If I'm doing
that because I know about the patent and I want to take
advantage of their otherwise innocent performance
collectively of the steps, at common law and at patent
law, it was uncontroversial that I was liable.  I was
responsible.
Just -- I don't want to belabor the Rosemond
point because I have a skeptical author looking at me,
but the common law made -- the cases going back made
clear that there was no escape from liability even
though neither Mr. Panner nor Ms. Anders may be directly
liable if they didn't know that each other was doing the
steps or otherwise cooperate with each other.  And
that's what this case is.  And that's why the Federal
Circuit's decision on its own terms is correct.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Panner, four minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PANNER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
In 1952, Congress adopted a statute that
took the development of infringement law largely out of
the hands of the courts.  There are -- there's a statute
strict liability 271(a) provision that provides for
direct infringement.  There are two basic indirect
infringement statutes, 271(b), which requires inducing
infringement, and 271(c).  And 271(c) is sort of
interesting because it has a very specific limitation on
when providing a component of invention will lead to
liability.  And what Congress said was if it's a
specially adapted component and it brings about
infringement, there -- there can be liability in that
circumstance.
But even if you know that what you're
selling is going to lead to infringement, if it's a
staple article of commerce, we don't impose liability in
that situation.  That's the kind of line-drawing that
Congress does.  Congress has done -- has made
adjustments when it felt appropriate and this -- this
Court has not hesitated to stick to the lines that --
that Congress drew and that's what it should do in this
case.  Unless the Court has questions.
