CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
next this morning in Case 09-996, Walker v. Martin.
Mr. Marshall.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD MARSHALL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Charles Martin never adequately explained
why he waited more than 5 years to present additional
claims to the California Supreme Court. As such, it was
no surprise that these claims were rejected as untimely.
California employs a habeas corpus timeliness rule that
merely requires reasonable diligence and disclosure.
The rule is adequate under this Court's longstanding
precedents, and the Ninth Circuit's decision to the
contrary should be reversed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about the
charge that, yes, we can agree with you that in general
years seems like a long time, but we have a brief from
the Habeas Corpus Resource Center that says that in the
- to 6-year delay category, 62 percent are dismissed on
the merits, and that you can't tell; sometimes they do
it on the merits, sometimes they do it as time-barred,
and there's no rationale to when they do one or the
other.
MR. MARSHALL: Three brief responses, Your
Honor. The first is that to measure summary denials,
you can't tell from a summary denial ruling what the
court was thinking about the time of delay.
The second point is that delay in California
is only half the equation. In California, there is the
substantial delay and then there's also the
justification portion. So persons who operate under
substantial delay still have an opportunity to justify
that delay and gain the desired review.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was the third?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would they have to --
would they have to justify the delay first? I thought
there was something about, well, if the time question is
more difficult and the merits are easy, there's no
merit, so we just decide this.
MR. MARSHALL: California's policy is to
take a first look at a habeas petition and determine
whether it is -- has a prima facie case or whether
procedural bars are apparent. A court that's denying a
case on the merits isn't necessarily saying the matter
was timely, and courts should be permitted to reach
whatever is the most judicially efficient method of
resolving such a question without it being held against
them.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So basically you're
taking the position or you're conceding that the
California courts are not consistent in their
application of the timeliness rule?
MR. MARSHALL: No --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your brief doesn't even
try to defend that position. Are you conceding that
there is inconsistent application of the rule?
MR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor.
The point that we're making is that when you
look at a rule, whether you apply it or not -- or
whether you impose it or not doesn't mean you're not
applying the rule. For example, when trial courts
review matters under the Fourth Amendment, a decision
not to exclude the evidence doesn't mean they didn't
apply the Fourth Amendment.
In this case, if the trial court -- or if
the reviewing court looks at the length of delay, and
then they may look at the justification to determine
that the delay was justified.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well -- I might be
speaking for her, but I thought that the Habeas Corpus
Resource Center brief showed that the court, the
California court, did reach some cases where an
explanation had not been proffered. And so it can't be
just a simple rule, that if you don't proffer an
explanation, you won't get heard. So what's the next
step in that? Why do they reach some and not others?
MR. MARSHALL: The California Supreme Court,
if a case is patently meritless and perhaps the
procedural question of timeliness is more complex --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could it be complex
when there's no justification offered?
MR. MARSHALL: The question of how long it
was --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, they pointed to a
certain number of cases that were 5 years or above in
delay where no justification was offered, and in some
they reached the merits and in others they applied a
procedural bar. So how is that consistent?
MR. MARSHALL: Well, the State court has
discretion to determine on the -- on procedural grounds
or on the merits --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there some Federal rule
that says you have to apply a procedural ground before
you decide the merits?
MR. MARSHALL: There is not. There's a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's up to California
which of the two it wants to use.
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And in California, if it
just says "denied," then the presumption is it's denied
on the merits; is that it?
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, a lack of a
prima facie case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and if -- so if
it's going to be denied on time bar grounds, there has
to be something to indicate that it's for that reason?
Otherwise we assume it's on the merits?
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct. Typically,
the citation is to Clark and Robbins, just as it was in
this case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do we know that
the California court just thinks that the Federal
question is too hard and it doesn't want to reach it?
It may be meritorious. How do we know they're not
applying the decision to reach the merits on an
arbitrary and capricious basis or one that seeks to
avoid hard Federal questions?
MR. MARSHALL: First is this Court has never
taken the position, when measuring adequacy, of assuming
that the rule is inadequate. The starting position that
this Court has always taken when looking at the adequacy
of a State rule is to look for evidence to see that --
if it can be shown to be inadequate. And I posit that
there's no evidence in this case that has been presented
to show that the State court is using their rules as a
pretext of any kind.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it arbitrary and
capricious for a court to take the ground of least
resistance, to decide the case on the easiest issue
that's presented? Is that arbitrary and capricious?
MR. MARSHALL: I posit that it's not. This
Court endorsed in Lambrix that it's all right for courts
to address procedural default after Teague if that's a
more judicially efficient method of handling the matter.
Strickland cases permit addressing either prong,
whichever is easier under the circumstances.
And so the State courts ought to be
permitted to address habeas corpuses on whatever the
easiest, most judicially efficient basis is without
being forced to answer a timeliness question if a case
is patently meritless. And there should be no finding
of inconsistency about that.
And, more importantly, summary denials, as
we're discussing here, don't afford any notice to
litigants of what the State's procedures are or what
they're thin king, because you have to guess. You have
to guess at how long the delay was, you have to guess at
whether there was any justification offered. So summary
denials do not assist the inquiry. And this Court has
never endorsed using summary denials in its adequacy
measure. This Court has always looked to published
State cases that explicate the rule.
This Court is looking to see whether the
rule has been pronounced by the State for a certain
amount of time, and then all of a sudden the litigant
that's receiving the imposition of the rule receives a
rule that was unexpected, either because the rule was
changed or because the rule was novel. Nothing like
that has happened here.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The phrase is "substantial
delay." Are there factors other than temporal factors
that go into whether or not the delay is substantial;
that is to say, the prisoner had difficulty contacting
his counsel and so forth? Is that what the court looks
at --
MR. MARSHALL: Those are --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when it looks at
"substantial"? And is there -- are there California
cases that tell us what the -- how do we define
"substantial"?
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor, to both.
The kind of circumstances you're describing
are exactly the kind of circumstances which makes
California's rule fair, because it considers how long it
takes a litigant to find his claim, get it prepared, and
get it into court.
And there are, in fact, concrete examples.
The Robbins case specifically provided that a 5-month
window from the discovery of triggering facts to the
presentation of the -- of the claim was a reasonable
amount of time. By contrast, the Stankewitz case
provided that 18 months of delay from the discovery of a
declaration was substantial and had to be justified.
JUSTICE KAGAN: When does the State think
that Mr. Martin's claim became untimely?
MR. MARSHALL: Certainly he hasn't given any
reason why he didn't present his additional claims at
the time of his earlier habeas corpus challenges.
Mr. Martin went through a full round of superior court,
court of appeal, and supreme court challenges, and then
waited some additional years and has never explained why
he didn't include these additional claims in those
earlier challenges.
JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think it --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's supposed to be filed
within 60 days. I don't -- this is along the same lines
as Justice Kagan's question. Suppose there's the first
round of habeas, and then he waits 60 days and files the
new claim. Would that be substantial?
Because you're indicating that failure to
include it in the first review is a factor to be weighed
against him. And I think that's what the Justice is
inquiring about.
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, it does -- it does weigh
against. And it's a rule of reasonableness, and it's a
discretion-based rule. And he would have to offer,
well, why didn't he include those claims earlier? And
if he had a good --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and what -- isn't that
a separate rule? I mean, no matter how soon, if he does
it a week after, doesn't California have a rule that you
can't come back with another habeas with material that
you could have produced in the -- in the former habeas?
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So time -- time has nothing
to do with that. It's just a separate -- a separate
bar.
MR. MARSHALL: California has articulated
that successive petitions are a type of delayed
petition. But you're right, there is a difference in
California between successive petitions and delayed
petitions, and the ruling here is that he was delayed
substantially.
I was just addressing the point about when
they might have been timely had they been presented
earlier, and it appears that in the earlier -- he didn't
get a timeliness ruling in his earlier challenges. So
it appears that he could have raised them then and did
not.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But if we can take out the
second and successive aspect of this and just focus on
the timeliness, when does the State think that this --
that these claims were -- became untimely?
MR. MARSHALL: It's a rule of reasonableness
and diligence that's circumstantially based, and --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you have the
circumstances here, so -- so under those circumstances,
when did the claims become untimely?
MR. MARSHALL: In the Robbins case, it
explains that you have -- a 5-month span from discovery
of the claims to presentation of the claims would be
reasonable.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The claims here --
JUSTICE KAGAN: The 5 months would be
reasonable. So is a year unreasonable? Is 5 months the
outer bounds, you know, assuming you don't have a good
reason? I understand that if you have a good reason,
that can lengthen it. But suppose you don't have a good
reason. When does the State think, okay, that's too
late?
MR. MARSHALL: There isn't -- there isn't a
defined time line. But our position is that a defined
time line is not a necessity for adequacy. This Court
has endorsed reasons of -- rules of reasonableness and
diligence. For example, in the Federal prisoner context
in Johnson v. United States, this Court said diligence
in discovery, while it isn't exact, is good enough.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I'm -- I'm trying to
get to even around, not -- not exact. My standard is
not exact. It's just around. Around what? Around 6
months, around 3 years, around someplace in the middle?
MR. MARSHALL: The position of the State is
that Robbins has indicated that 5 months is reasonable,
months is definitely too long, and that there is a
discretion-based determination in the middle.
JUSTICE ALITO: What if it's filed within 6
months and it's -- it's rejected as untimely, and the
petitioner wants to try to demonstrate that this
represents a grave departure from the way these are
normally handled by the California Supreme Court? Is
there any way for the petitioner to do that?
MR. MARSHALL: He would point to the
published authority and argue that his case was outside
of the parameters of what the State had done in the
past. However, our position is that, since California's
ruling is adequate, that there would be no evidence of
such available to this particular litigant. A
hypothetical litigant might be able to proffer that
prior cases had treated claims differently.
And the other problem with California is
that it would require two exact same litigants, and it's
very rare for two exact same litigants to have the exact
same claims, the exact same bases for their delay, filed
in exactly the same amount of delay. So true comparison
is difficult.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think 5 years is too
long, though?
MR. MARSHALL: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- this was taken
over by California from capital cases, but in the
capital case context, there -- they have a 90-day
presumption of timeliness. And when they extended the
capital framework to non-capital cases, they left out
the presumption that within 90 days is timely. Was
there reason for that?
MR. MARSHALL: Respectfully, I must
disagree. It actually is the other way around. The
capital case policies took the timeliness rule -- took
the general timeliness rule for themselves and added the
presumption.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there reason for and
then saying, well, in the capital context, we're going
to make it clear that 90 days -- 90 days is timely. Why
didn't they add that to the original rule?
MR. MARSHALL: To the other litigant rule?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. MARSHALL: They, I think, felt that the
rule was adequate the way it was, that a
circumstantially based rule, a reasonableness-based
rule, was sufficient to guide the conduct of litigants
to tell them what they needed to do to present their
case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why would it be
different in the capital context? What was the reason
for adding the 90 days there?
MR. MARSHALL: Capital cases are
significantly more complex, the punishments are -- are
more significant, and so additional scrutiny might be
warranted in those contexts.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- I'm a little bit
confused by your response to Justice Scalia. I thought
from your brief that you were positing that there was no
claim of inconsistent application of a rule that could
ever survive.
Let's assume for the sake of argument the
following hypothetical, and probably not far off the
mark. Litigants who don't know the law, who claim
they're not educated in it, say that they have just
learned about a new California case that gives them a
ground to challenge their prior sentence. And the
litigants learn about the case anywhere between 3 and 6
months of the issuance of the case by the supreme court.
A dozen litigants apply for this discretionary review,
and half of them are granted review and half are not.
Half of them get a correction of the sentence and half
of them don't. There is no difference between them
that's discernible. They each just claim ignorance.
Is that a case where someone would be out of
luck, and why, for a claim of inconsistent application?
MR. MARSHALL: I didn't follow the
hypothetical. Was -- were some of the hypothetical
individuals getting time-barred?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Getting time-barred.
Some are time-barred; some --
MR. MARSHALL: And some of the individuals
were getting relief?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.
MR. MARSHALL: And is there yet a third set
of people who are getting --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Some -- all of them
are within that small framework of 3 to 6 months from
the time the supreme court decision was issued. They
all claimed they just learned of it and filed
immediately, and some are getting relief and some are
not.
Is that an inconsistent application that
would be cognizable under your view of the rule as it
should be?
MR. MARSHALL: That sounds inconsistent to
me, Your Honor. However --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It does. So the
question --
MR. MARSHALL: But such a thing would not
occur in California.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What?
MR. MARSHALL: Such a thing would not occur
in California.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the issue.
MR. MARSHALL: A meritorious --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which is: What rule do
you want us to impose and how does that rule capture
that case?
MR. MARSHALL: There's a specific exception
for timeliness in California to preclude fundamental
miscarriages of justice. And anybody that had a
meritorious United States --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not answering my
question.
MR. MARSHALL: I misunderstood it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. No. Why do you
concede that it would be bad? Can't the State, if it
wishes, give grace to people who did apply late, but
because the case is so meritorious or for any other
reason? The issue is whether those people who filed 5
years later and knew that it was very late, whether
they're entitled to have their cases heard, not whether
the -- the State allows somebody who filed 6 years
earlier to have it heard. How does that do any
injustice to the person who knew that 5 years was, you
know, you're likely to be denied?
MR. MARSHALL: I absolutely agree, Your
Honor. The basis for my earlier comments was the -- I
believe the hypothetical was 3 to 6 months, which was a
much shorter period of time.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see why the State
has to be consistent in it. If -- as a matter of grace,
it can -- it can allow some people, so long as the
people who are denied had every reason to believe that
they were coming in too late, and 5 years is coming in
too late.
MR. MARSHALL: Just as occurred in this
case, I absolutely agree, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it doesn't answer
why inconsistent application among similarly situated
individuals should not provide an avenue of relief.
MR. MARSHALL: This Court has never
reversed --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Five years is different.
I'm talking about treatment of similarly situated
individuals differently.
MR. MARSHALL: First, this Court has only
looked at the treatment of this individual, not
disparate treatment of prior individuals. The -- the
rule exists for --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, I don't disagree
with you. So that the question I have for your
adversary is whether or not he can point to any case
where a litigant who proffered an -- something that was
evident on the trial record and on the appellate record
was ever granted a merits review after 5 years. Because
I don't see them proffering any case that shows that.
But -- and I think that may be your argument.
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, exactly. That no one --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I -- I'm not -- I
don't understand your answer, then. You have -- let me
just adapt what Justice Sotomayor said. You have -- a
case, a Supreme Court case is decided. And you have
-- 10 habeas petitioners in California who file on
exactly the same day. And five of them, if you were to
get to the merits of their claim under this new decision
of this Court, five of them would be entitled to relief,
five of them would not be entitled to relief on the
merits. And the California Supreme Court holds that the
five who would be entitled to relief are procedurally
barred and the five who were not entitled to relief on
the merits are not, and they are rejected on the merits.
Now, would that be an adequate State ground?
MR. MARSHALL: Well, I'm not sure. It
doesn't happen in California that way.
JUSTICE ALITO: No, I know --
MR. MARSHALL: All right. I'm sorry.
JUSTICE ALITO: -- and I'm not suggesting
that it would. But if it were to happen, would that be
adequate?
MR. MARSHALL: It doesn't sound like it
would be adequate under this Court's prior tests.
JUSTICE ALITO: So fair notice is not the
only requirement.
MR. MARSHALL: This Court has also required
legitimate State interests, and this Court has used the
legitimate State interests context, like, for example,
in Smith v. Texas, where this Court has declared a
particular kind of violation was a constitutional
violation and the Court exercised its discretion not to
reach the violation, this Court found that the State had
no legitimate State interest in such a ruling.
Our point is that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but the cases that
you're using in which we insisted upon adequacy in the
sense of equal treatment of equal people are cases in
which the effect of the State decision was to exclude
the matter from Federal -- from Federal supervision.
The matter could not come before the Federal courts.
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: This is something quite
different. This is applying a time limit. I don't see
why we have to apply the same rule and -- and look into
the -- whether it's not discretionary. I mean, to say
it's discretionary always means that sometimes similar
cases may be treated differently.
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor, exactly.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't know why you --
you concede that -- that we take an adequacy rule that's
used for one purpose and should apply it to a totally
different situation.
MR. MARSHALL: It was the meritorious nature
of the claims. And in California, meritorious claims
don't receive the time bar because there's exceptions
that take those into consideration.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But none of this is -- is a
device as is used in the cases that -- that you are
referring to that go into adequacy, a device to exclude
the Federal courts from the case. That's -- that's not
what's going on here, is it?
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: I guess if the situation
were such that a lawyer who is representing a client and
has to figure out has there been too much delay or not,
suppose he looked into the situation thoroughly and he
said, gee, I just have no idea, because half the cases
come out one way and half of them come out the other
way. Could he then go to the California Supreme Court
and say, Court, look what you have been doing? And
would the court then grant a hearing on that and
possibly correct it?
MR. MARSHALL: Well, in California, there's
no such evidence, but I suppose that the lawyer could --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you're
saying there is no such evidence.
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct. In fact --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I suspected
reading this. But if there were such evidence is there
a route in California that they could deal with it?
MR. MARSHALL: Certainly.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not a question
of adequacy, is it? It's a question of notice.
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Adequacy of notice, because
no notice might be an inadequate notice.
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: And if it's absolutely
divided 50/50, you have no notice. You don't know what
will happen. And it isn't a rule to say, oh, this is
our rule, you don't know what will happen.
MR. MARSHALL: Within an area of discretion,
like, for example, the finding of whether a piece of
evidence was hearsay, if the court down the hall finds
the evidence should be excluded and the court in the
next room says it should be admissible, that isn't
necessarily an abuse of --
JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you, we are in
hypothetical, never-never land so far. But it's
possible your opponents will convince us it's real land
and not never-never land.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And for it to be
real -- just so I understand -- for it to be real, you
have to have a defense counsel, a client comes to him
with a non-frivolous Federal habeas claim, and the
defense counsel says, I can't tell whether we're going
to be barred by this time rule or not. Some courts,
looks like we will; some don't. So -- what?
Of course he's going to file the Federal
habeas and see if it's determined to be adequate or
inadequate, correct?
MR. MARSHALL: California's rule is
perfectly suited to such a scenario. All that litigant
has to do is explain why they didn't bring the claim
sooner, either from late discovery or some other
impediment, and the substantial delay can be justified
with exactly those sorts of circumstances.
JUSTICE KAGAN: What happens if a -- a
person in this position is trying to investigate
multiple claims at once, and some of them are ready to
be put before the court and others are not? How does he
know, look, I really better get in there right now and
put whatever I have before the court? Or, look, I have
a little bit more time in order to investigate some of
my claims further? How does he make that determination?
MR. MARSHALL: The Gallego case specifically
speaks to that exact circumstance and provides that if
you have a good faith basis in investigating further
triggering facts, you may withhold the claims that
you've already presented -- or prepared, to prevent
piecemeal presentation. And that's a perfectly
acceptable explanation in California.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Why is it, Mr. Marshall,
that the -- the California courts have not been a little
bit more transparent about what the presumptive time
limits are? You know, look, it's around a year unless
have you a good reason. You know, at least we're taking
years off the table.
I mean, why don't we have decisions like
that from the California courts that would -- would help
folks here?
MR. MARSHALL: Well, other than the Robbins
decision, which speaks of 5 months as being reasonable,
the court has tried to maintain a discretion-based,
circumstantially driven analysis in which they take
different litigants into consideration. One litigant
may be in a maximum security prison and only gets to go
to the library once a month. Another litigant may be in
a minimum security prison; he can go to the library
every day. Those two litigants are going to be
different and should be treated differently.
And if I might reserve the remainder of my
time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Bigelow.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. BIGELOW
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BIGELOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and if it
please the Court:
The adequacy inquiry is framed by asking
whether the State rule in question is firmly established
and regularly followed. At its core is the prevention
of State courts from declining to enforce Federal rights
and to maintain Federal authority over the protection of
constitutional rights in the Supremacy Clause. In its
brief at page 7, the State would seem to agree that a
rule is inadequate unless earlier decisions of the State
court are at least consistent.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but what did you
present below, or what has Habeas Corpus Resource Center
presented? A case with a 5-year delay where the claimed
errors are apparent on the trial record and the
appellate record, and no justification for the delay is
proffered. Those are the three seminal facts that go to
the requirements of Robbins and the other supreme
court -- other California Supreme Court cases.
Do you have one case that's similar where
the court went to the merits?
MR. BIGELOW: Sanders was a 5-year case
that's cited in my brief. Jones was --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Was that someone
who made a claim based on the trial and appellate record
with no justification?
MR. BIGELOW: I'll speak to justification in
just a moment, if I may.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh.
MR. BIGELOW: And Jones was an 8-year case.
The amicus brief, the Resource Center, cited Cooper,
Duke, and Hardiman. Cooper was a 5-year case. Those
were both IAC claims which appear to -- with respect to
the Sanders and the Jones case, I cannot -- I do not
know specifically what the claim was as I stand here,
and I apologize for that. But let us look at
justification for just a moment. The justification
offered in those cases was that the habeas petitioner
was ignorant and had no counsel. Now, I will represent
to you that, in the State of California, 99.9 percent of
the lawyers -- the lawyers -- 99 percent of the
petitioners who file aren't represented by counsel and
aren't lawyers themselves, and I will represent further
that probably 98 percent, 99 percent have no more than a
th grade education.
JUSTICE SCALIA: These cases that you cite,
before you go any further -- are they cases in which the
California Supreme Court came out with an opinion saying
that 6 years was okay? Or are they just cases where,
without an opinion, the California Supreme Court went to
the merits?
MR. BIGELOW: They are -- well, in the
Sanders case and in the Jones case, there were -- I
believe that they were decisions in -- they were
decisions. These cases predated the Clark/Robbins
situation. In the Cooper case and the Duke case, those
cases --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what do you mean
they were decisions, written opinions or just went to
the merits and decided the merits? Did they say
anything about the delay question?
MR. BIGELOW: They did say something about
the delay question in at least two of the cases, well,
at least in one of the cases, the Mitchell case, which
was a 2-year delay. They said 2 years is unreasonable,
but I didn't cite those. And I cannot speak to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the other side says
that, unless there is an opinion, the reason they may
have gone to the merits is it was just a lot easier.
MR. BIGELOW: No --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't have to worry
about it.
MR. BIGELOW: To that extent, it -- it's my
recollection they went to the merits. They're not
silent denials, and they don't cite Clark/Robbins
because they predated Clark/Robbins. With respect to
the Cooper case and Duke case, those I believe were
silent denials. Now -- and that's the interesting thing
about California. We are presuming -- we are presuming
and this Court has reached that presumption -- that they
are merit denials when they are silent, but we really
don't know --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's a puzzle to
me. I mean, Justice Scalia's question was courts all
the time -- they -- you used see all the time they don't
decide an issue of whether it's filed too late because
it's the simplest thing just to decide the merits. It's
the same result. And sometimes they don't do that. But
that happens often in a district court on appeal and
triple in a supreme court which has hundreds or
thousands of questions for review. So how do we know
that that simple practice, which I've never heard of as
attacked as unconstitutional -- how do we know that that
isn't what's going on?
MR. BIGELOW: Well, in -- in any given year
recently, in recent history at least, there are about
0 truly silent denials, no explanation. Now, the
State says we can't consider them because they mean
nothing. From our perspective, they have to mean
something, and they have to count because we don't have
the information that the litigant in this matter is --
doesn't have the same kind of resources, for example,
that the State does.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but that's --
they -- what's your point? Eight hundred are silent.
What does that show?
MR. BIGELOW: That they have got to count in
the adequacy -- in the consistency application, they've
got to count against the Petitioner.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why?
MR. BIGELOW: Because the Petitioner is the
one who has the resources and has the opportunity --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, but then you
can make any claim against him. I mean, what I
wonder -- maybe this is where I'm leading -- the
California Supreme Court is not the only court in
California where people file for habeas petitions, is
MR. BIGELOW: No. The appellate court --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. So why, if there's
inconsistency in this rule, wouldn't somebody go look at
the decisions of the appellate courts which write their
reasons down, and then you would know whether it is
being decided -- applied inconsistently or not
inconsistently. Why look at a blank wall? Why not look
at people who write opinions? And then you'll find out.
MR. BIGELOW: Not all -- not all habeas
petitions in California are filed in lower courts.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, of course not. But is
your claim -- are you conceding, or are you conceding,
are you denying, are you just saying nothing about
whether the practice in this rule, applying the rule of
substantial unexcused delay, disqualifies you for --
that's the rule, isn't it?
MR. BIGELOW: That's the rule.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Are you saying
it is being applied consistently or inconsistently or
you do not know --
MR. BIGELOW: It is being applied --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- in all courts below the
California Supreme Court?
MR. BIGELOW: In all courts below, I do not
know, but --
JUSTICE BREYER: So you don't know. So what
you've come -- what you've done your research on are
questions that cannot be answered due to the fact that a
supreme court normally doesn't say why when it denies
something, but you haven't looked into the research that
is readily obtainable, which is these are courts that
write opinions. Is that -- have I gotten that
correctly?
MR. BIGELOW: That's --
JUSTICE BREYER: Because if that's
correct --
MR. BIGELOW: That would be a correct
statement.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then I don't
see why you didn't because it would be so easy, if
you're right, to show this from the lower courts, but of
course if you're wrong, it wouldn't be easy, then a
blank wall is better than nothing.
Now, what can you say that will disabuse me
of the notion that I just expressed?
MR. BIGELOW: The -- the lower appellate
courts -- there are six -- there are six district --
district courts. There are six appellate districts, I
guess, within the State -- within the State of
California and who knows how many superior courts. For
a petitioner to examine the holdings, the rulings in
each of those districts would be virtually impossible.
The only one -- for a petitioner who is in prison, who
is unrepresented by counsel, and let's not forget that
non-capital habeas petitioners, and this is a
non-capital habeas petitioner, is not represented by
counsel.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But some are --
there's a thing called sampling techniques, and sampling
techniques are designed to limit the burden. I'm not
saying it wouldn't be burdensome, but you have examined
thousands of cases. And so I'm back to my original
question. And statisticians, many of whom would like to
help you perhaps you could find some, could do this for
you, I think.
MR. BIGELOW: Amicus did it with respect to
the California Supreme Court.
JUSTICE BREYER: The wrong court. And
amicus did it from the time that -- that the case was
filed, while the rule is you start the period of running
from the case it was reasonably -- the person should
reasonably have known his issue, which isn't the same
time as the time his case was decided against him. So,
yes.
MR. BIGELOW: Well, that's an excellent
point the Court makes. And it is that -- nobody in this
room, nobody in this room can tell this -- this litigant
when his petition was filed late.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's true.
MR. BIGELOW: And so --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but everybody
-- everybody in this room can tell him that he is
obligated to file the petition as promptly as the
circumstances allow. He has complete notice of that.
And if he wants to go and do the research and say, well,
here's one where they let it in after 5 months, but
here's one where they didn't leave it in after 9 months,
and he sits here and decides so I'm going to wait 9
months and put my money on that court -- that -- that is
not a scenario that's likely to happen, right?
MR. BIGELOW: That -- that -- it is not a
scenario that is likely to happen, but the construct
that the Court has -- "as promptly as circumstances
would allow" shows up in a footnote in a capital case.
It -- that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not
challenging that as the State rule, are you?
MR. BIGELOW: That is the -- that's the
State rule that they proffer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
MR. BIGELOW: That is the rule that the
State proffers. And what I'm suggesting is that that
rule is so vague and unknown, in the context at least of
the habeas litigation, no one understands what that rule
means. How prompt is prompt?
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Bigelow, is that
right? I take your point that nobody can say exactly
when Mr. Martin's claims became untimely, but 5 years is
untimely, isn't it?
MR. BIGELOW: Five years is not untimely
if --
JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, if there's a very
good reason, but 5 years without an explanation is --
why is that a hard question?
MR. BIGELOW: Even with an explanation, 5
years is not beyond the pale of cases that have been
previously decided and with respect to similarly
situated litigants. Other cases in California -- and
don't forget, please, that the -- the Habeas Corpus
Research Center took only a small sample of a single day
and that was the day that Martin's decision came down.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they didn't look
at possible justifications at all, correct?
MR. BIGELOW: There was no justification
with respect to Mr. Martin's petition, that's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I'm not
asking about Mr. Martin's.
MR. BIGELOW: Oh, I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This -- the analysis
that the amicus undertook simply looked at the
chronological time. They did not consider the fact
that, for example, somebody with 3 years might have had
an explanation; somebody with 1 year might have not had
any. And they may view those cases as different cases.
MR. BIGELOW: I -- I would disagree. I
think that they did, in fact, look at explanations for
delay, and a curious thing that they did find, which is
in their brief, is that even though -- cases which --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how did they
look -- did they look for explanations for delay when
you had the one-sentence denial?
MR. BIGELOW: I think the short answer to
that is yes, but they also looked at silent denials as
well. So they found that where there was no explanation
for delay, more of those cases were decided actually on
the merits than cases that did offer a delay. So
there's a -- a gross inconsistency, a gross
inconsistency between the need for justification of
delay.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how much range
are you willing to give the State? Do they have 3
months' range? I mean, if you come in and say, well,
here they were filed in 9 months and they were allowed,
and here they were filed in 6 months and they weren't
allowed.
Is that a problem under our consistency
requirement?
MR. BIGELOW: It wouldn't be a problem.
That would be a discretionary rule if there were
guidelines; if there were guidelines --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it says --
MR. BIGELOW: -- some kind of guidelines --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says "as promptly
as the circumstances allow." And then they go back and
say there is a 3-range, a 3-month range.
MR. BIGELOW: Oh, if they went back, with
decisional law, decided the range?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You do the same sort
of research you've done here, and you find out that --
that there's a 3-month range. Sometimes -- I mean,
there are cases and you can show a lot where they are
allowed at 9 months, and then you find cases that are
not allowed under 6 months.
MR. BIGELOW: I would be in a lot more
tenuous position arguing this case if there was some
guidance to litigants with respect to what does
constitute a reasonable time period within which to
file. What --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And suppose -- suppose
California had a rule that said that you have to file
within 1 year of the finality of the conviction, absent
good cause for the delay. If that were the rule that
California had, your client certainly would be untimely
and you wouldn't have a leg to stand on, right?
MR. BIGELOW: If that were the rule, the
petition would have been filed timely.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would --
MR. BIGELOW: That's my answer. Had that --
that is my answer to that question. Had that time
period been known, the petition would have been filed
timely.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if there is a
requirement of prompt -- as promptly as circumstances
permit, wouldn't a person know that 5 years is not as
prompt as circumstances permitted?
MR. BIGELOW: There has -- my answer is no,
because in California there are no guidelines. That
came in the Clark decision, which was 1993, and nothing
has been decided in the State of California to define,
to clarify, to narrow what constitutes "promptly." What
constitutes "promptly."
JUSTICE KAGAN: Why was this petition not
filed for 5 years?
MR. BIGELOW: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Why -- why was this petition
not filed for 5 years?
MR. BIGELOW: The record is -- does not
speak to that point specifically.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But didn't this come
about because it was returned? This was not -- I'm
thinking about -- he didn't -- he didn't make any claim
that he was -- he was diligent.
MR. BIGELOW: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: He didn't make any claim
that he was diligent in filing it 5 years late.
MR. BIGELOW: There were no claims made
excusing the -- excusing the filing at that time period.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume that -- that
California had just adopted this -- this rule that
habeas petitions have to be filed as promptly as
circumstances permit. They've just brand-new adopted
it, and you're the lawyer for somebody who says, you
know, I think I'm going to wait 5 years.
Don't you think that even if there were no
California law on the subject, you would know that his
habeas claim is going to be denied?
MR. BIGELOW: If this were a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really need case law
to tell you that 5 years is not as promptly as
circumstances permit when you -- when you have no
justification?
MR. BIGELOW: Decisional law is what our
system is all about, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so you can't have a
first case?
MR. BIGELOW: No, I think you can. I think
you can have a first case so long as -- so long as the
standard itself is not so vague --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.
MR. BIGELOW: -- that reasonable -- that
reasonable men are able -- so long as reasonable men are
able to understand the standard.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think reasonable men
differ about 5 years?
MR. BIGELOW: Well --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bigelow, isn't this
similar to the rule that governed Federal habeas review
prior to AEDPA?
MR. BIGELOW: Well --
JUSTICE KAGAN: A similar kind of delay
standard, whatever "delay" means.
MR. BIGELOW: No, if I recall, the standard
was prejudicial delay. If I recall correctly. And
prejudicial delay, if I'm correct, is a quantifiable
standard. It is a standard that had, over the years,
come to be understood. There was a -- a shared
expectation with what prejudice encompassed. And so
yes, it's similar, but it's not exact. It's not the
standard in California.
And if I may, California clearly understands
that case law can offer guidance to litigants. In In re
Harris, a case cited by -- by both of us, by both
parties, the State of California was concerned about the
Walterus rule, which is another procedural bar. And it
went on to -- it acknowledged that it wasn't clear at
that time, and it went on to explain what the Walterus
rule was all about and why it was needed.
In another case, more recently, the State of
California -- a case not cited, the Kelly case; it's a
06 case -- the California Supreme Court directed its
lower courts over which it supervises to provide greater
detail in their analysis of Wende briefs, which is the
State's alternative to the Anders brief, in order to
provide guidance to litigants, to provide guidance to
justices, and to -- to provide guidance to the Federal
courts who may be called upon to determine procedural
bars.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, I understand
that you'd have a much stronger case if you were dealing
with a judge-made rule about timeliness, if the courts,
on their own authority, said, look, we're not going to
look at things that are filed 4 years late because that
prejudices the State, it prejudices us, et cetera.
But here you have something different. You
have a rule, right? An established rule: promptly as
the circumstances allow.
MR. BIGELOW: Judge-made.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Judge-made, but it's
been around for a long time. This isn't a new rule
that's just coming in.
MR. BIGELOW: So a rule in a footnote in a
capital case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me get
back. I tried to -- when you made that point earlier, I
wanted to follow up on it. Your claim is not that you
don't know or defendants in California don't know that
the rule is "as promptly as the circumstances allow," do
you?
MR. BIGELOW: No.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I thought you
had fair notice of that rule.
MR. BIGELOW: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.
MR. BIGELOW: Just not the parameters of the
rule. And the parameters of the rule, the guidelines
which guide judges, which guide litigants, is just
simply not there in California, either with respect to
that rule or with respect to substantial delay.
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't your argument that the
California timeliness rule was never an adequate rule,
never can proceed, never can bar consideration of a
Federal claim?
MR. BIGELOW: The -- had the -- never. Had
the rule been applied even-handedly, had the rule been
applied consistently, it would certainly be more
adequate. However, and getting back to Justice Scalia's
point, it has never been fairly defined, so it does not
clearly --
JUSTICE ALITO: What if Mr. Walker had
waited 20 years; would it still be inadequate as to him?
MR. BIGELOW: In -- that's not -- that's not
this case. The rule hasn't been -- the rule has not
been thoroughly set out, at -- at least the guidelines
haven't been set, and it might be --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why can't you take
the brackets of -- what was it, 5 months is reasonable
time; 18 months is not a reasonable time? Mr. Martin
falls outside of the 18 months.
MR. BIGELOW: Certainly, one -- one could do
that, but that hasn't been established as the brackets,
and it is, after all, California's rule. And it is
California that -- which needs to make that
determination. Now, it's -- it's not as if California
hadn't actually tried to do that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was a
decision that said 18 months is too long.
MR. BIGELOW: Not a decision that said that.
These were extrapolated -- no, I beg your pardon.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a decision that
said 18 months is too long.
MR. BIGELOW: There was a decision that said
a 16-month period, but that was pre-Clark. That was a
pre-Clark decision that actually did say 16 months after
all is not a particularly long period of time. And
another decision -- I beg your -- I beg the Court's
pardon -- another decision said that 2 years wasn't a
particularly long period of time.
But those are -- those are pre-Clark
decisions, if you will, and this case is relying upon --
or the State, rather, is relying on what has come after
-- after Clark with respect to its "as promptly as the
circumstances should allow."
But the other point that I would like to
make, it's not as if the State of California doesn't
understand the need for a finite period of time to
provide guidance to -- to all parties. In -- in
Saffold, the State requested this Court presume a filing
period. I think it was -- I want to say 60 days. More
recently in Chavez, a filing period was requested to be
presumed, again by the State.
And both occasions, this -- this Court
declined because it isn't this Court's prerogative to
set rules for the State. What this Court did do is it
certified the question to the State of California, or
they asked the Ninth Circuit at least to certify the
question to the State of California. The Ninth Circuit
did exactly as this Court asked it to do and certified
the question, and the State of California said: We're
not going to tell you what a timeliness period is.
Now, that does not help pro se litigants
with minimal education, without benefit of counsel, who
are the vast majority of habeas petitioners in the State
of California.
JUSTICE ALITO: How many --
MR. BIGELOW: They --
JUSTICE ALITO: How may of these petitions
are filed each year in the California Supreme Court?
MR. BIGELOW: Approximately 2,500, give or
take.
JUSTICE ALITO: Approximately what?
MR. BIGELOW: Approximately 2,500, based on
a LexisNexis kind of search.
JUSTICE ALITO: With that many petitions, is
there any possibility that a multifactor test such as
the one that California is applying could be applied
with any degree of regularity, unless there's some sort
of secret internal guidelines that are being applied by
the California Supreme Court in deciding this?
MR. BIGELOW: That's the problem. That's
the problem. The test that is applied without
guidelines, without any kind of guidelines. Judicial
discretion -- judicial discretion is informed
discretion; it is not discretion -- it's -- it's
judgment pursuant to known guidelines. It is not a
judgment issued pursuant to inclination.
And the concern is that with this kind of
amorphous standard, inconsistent and arbitrary
application is impossible to enforce.
JUSTICE BREYER: But it's like having rules;
when you have rules and say 60 days or 90 days, you find
impossible cases that you should have heard because it
was the 91st day or it was the 92nd day, and then you
give the people equitable discretion to depart from it,
and pretty soon you get litigation over that. I mean,
there's no perfect system.
MR. BIGELOW: Discretion to depart from a
rule that has been violated is one thing. Here, there
is no quantifiable or known parameters within which
discretion --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is the solution for
California to say, if you delay more than a year from
when you should have known, you're barred except we'll
excuse it for any number of reasons?
MR. BIGELOW: Certainly, and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be a
regularly and consistently applied rule in your mind?
MR. BIGELOW: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be enough?
MR. BIGELOW: It -- it wouldn't necessarily
be consistently applied until we're down the road and we
learn how consistently it has, in fact, been applied,
but certainly it would be -- it would be an appropriate
rule.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You may be -- you'd better
be careful about what you wish for because I am not sure
that the kind of system that's being proposed is going
to be better for habeas applicants than the one that
California now has. We really don't know that, do we?
MR. BIGELOW: We -- if -- if we collectively
screamed and yelled when AEDPA passed with its 1-year
statute of limitations, we've learned to live with it,
and we meet the deadlines because we know what the
deadlines are.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And pro se litigants who
don't know deadlines generally are going to live with
knowing that -- what?
MR. BIGELOW: They've got a better chance of
-- they've got a better chance of meeting deadlines if
they know what those deadlines are, and there's nothing
to take -- there is nothing to take the flexibility from
the California Supreme Court if there is a deadline.
But the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about -- that's
why I go back to the lower courts. If there really is a
problem here, why wouldn't the bar look into how well
this practice is working in the lower courts and find
out, well, what is the practice? How do they use it?
Do we want more flexibility? Do we want more definite
rules? That's -- I agree that you put your finger on a
problem, an important problem. I'm not at all certain
that the one system is better or required or compulsory.
MR. BIGELOW: The red light is going to go
on in an about a minute. Let me answer it this way:
The most powerful court probably in the world requested
clarification of the rule and didn't get it. I don't
know who else is going to.
Unless there are other questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Marshall, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TODD MARSHALL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MARSHALL: This Court has explained, in
Dugger v. Adams, that a handful of inconsistent cases do
not undermine the adequacy inquiry, and unless the
inconsistency becomes so profound that it undermines
fair notice, it should not matter that there are some
different rulings that can be shown. There's no reason
to think that a rule that has a bright deadline and then
takes into considerations after the deadline is somehow
preferable to a rule that takes into considerations
discretionary circumstances in the first instance.
And unless there are any further
questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the
