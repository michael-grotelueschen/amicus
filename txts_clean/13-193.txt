CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 13-193, Susan B. Anthony List
v. Steven Driehaus.
Mr. Carvin?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CARVIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Under this Court's straight-forward precedent,
this case presents a clearly ripe and justiciable
controversy.  All agree that the test is whether or not
there's a credible threat of enforcement.  Here we know
THAT there's a credible threat of enforcement because
the Commission's Probable Cause panel in 2010 said that
the speech at issue probably violated Ohio's false
statement law.
Since an enforcement agency has already told
us that this statement probably violates their law, we
obviously face a clear and very credible threat of
enforcement if we repeat those statements as we alleged
we would do.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you making that
argument on behalf of the other organization?  Susan B.
Anthony List, you have accurately described what
occurred.  But the other organization has never been
charged before the Ohio Election Commission.  Is there
any reason to believe anybody's going to lodge a
complaint against it?
MR. CARVIN:  Well, Your Honor, when they
filed their complaint, they alleged that they had not
spoken those words because Susan B. Anthony had already
been drawn into the Commission's procedures and the
Commission had already found probable cause.  So
since --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is that any
different from -- how is that any different from the
people in Younger, who the Court dismissed as having no
standing because they hadn't been prosecuted despite the
same identical claim?  They were chilled, they might
intend to do something similar, et cetera.
MR. CARVIN:  Well, as Justice Brennan put it
in Younger, the -- the speech that the other three
speakers were going to engage in was not even of the
same genre as that of the person who would be -- was
being prosecuted, which is why the Court, quite
correctly said, that their chilling effect was based on
an imaginatory or speculative fear of enforcement.
Whereas here, COAST was going to say precisely the same
words that SBA had already been found to have probably
violated the False-Statement Law.  So it's hard to
imagine or --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that the Court
in Younger said with respect to those other three, that
they had never been threatened with prosecution.  I
don't recall it made a distinction on the basis of
what they wanted to talk about.
MR. CARVIN:  Well, two of the people were
labor picketers that had never been threatened and one
was somebody who was simply teaching Marx in a classroom
environment.  They were quite distinct from the speaker
who had been prosecuted under the incitement to violence
law.  And, again, Justice Brennan looked at their
statements, compared them to the statements of the
person who had been prosecuted and said they're not even
of the same genre.
So we're not arguing that somebody could
come in here and argue that anything that's
controversial creates a credible threat of enforcement,
but we've got a very specific concrete example.  Speaker
A says X, that's found to have a probable cause.
Speaker B quite reasonably thinks if they've just
dragged Speaker A in front of this Commission and the
Commission has found probable cause, there's no reason
in the world to think that we won't be brought in.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the one question is
who is the "they"?  Now, it might be that Susan B.
Anthony List is considered a group with real clout.  So
a candidate might be really concerned about Susan B.
Anthony's speech.  But the other organization maybe is
not as well funded and the candidate says, well, a lot
of things are said in political campaigns.  I'll let
this one go.  This one doesn't hurt me as much.
MR. CARVIN:  Two points, Justice Ginsburg.
First, Driehaus had shown a very -- he was in the middle
of a very tough reelection campaign and he had shown he
was going to take all the steps he could to squelch this
notion that he supported taxpayer abortions.  He had
already spent all the money in terms of SBA list.  So it
literally -- all he'd have to do is Xerox it to -- to
come after COAST.
But I think the key point here is we don't
have to negative every conceivable hypothetical on why
Driehaus might not do this, and the Commission might not
do that.  There's a presumption that if you have
violated the laws as the Probable Cause Panel said we
probably had, that the agency is going to enforce the
law.  If you require us to negative every hypothetical,
then the only way to test that hypothesis is to
engage in the speech and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you square this
with Clapper?
MR. CARVIN:  I apologize.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why isn't this as
speculative as Clapper?  You have to assume first that
there's a candidate who is going to react by initiating
an action, you have to assume further that a panel is
going to render the same decision, and you have to
assume even further that a Federal prosecutor -- that
the prosecutor is going to agree and actually bring the
case.
MR. CARVIN:  Well, those are the steps that
are required to put my clients in jail.  But we suffer
Article III injury well before any prosecutor prosecutes
us.  Once a complaint is filed, then we are subjected to
very serious costs and risks of litigation in front of
the Commission, and in the middle of an election
campaign during the crucial weeks when we're trying to
get our speech out.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I take it that's --
that's enforced by subpoenas.  If the speaker doesn't
want to appear before the Commission, he can be served
with a subpoena, which is judicially enforceable.
MR. CARVIN:  There's -- there's two things,
Justice Kennedy.  At the initial stage, if we don't
respond to the complaint, the Commission's regulations
make it clear that they may well view that as a default
judgment and -- and enter a judgment against us right
away.
Once the probable cause determination comes
down, you have all of these kinds of subpoenas and very
intrusive discovery of the sort you had in our case
where they ask for our communications with everybody on
the right wing of the political aisle, where we have to
reveal our internal communications as well as those of
others.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, the State can
characterize its own position, but do you understand the
State to say that well, the existence of the Commission
means that frivolous claims can be washed out, that they
can actually get some protection by an advance ruling.
Is that the State's position?
MR. CARVIN:  No.  Neither the Commission has
argued that, and the Attorney General's amicus on our
side makes it quite clear that there is no provision for
doing it.  If you read their rules, they have to go to a
probable cause hearing in three days.  There's literally
no opportunity to wipe out so-called frivolous claims.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I mean, I thought -- I
thought their position was that this would -- would
sharpen the controversy and make it more concrete or
something like that.
MR. CARVIN:  That's precisely right.
They're arguing -- the whole point of this statute is
some kind of truth-telling function, so they want us
to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There is a provision for
an advisory opinion, unless the question is if you are
arguing strenuously that this statute violates the
Constitution.  You could have asked the Commission for
an advisory opinion saying that the statute can't be
enforced, but you didn't do that.
MR. CARVIN:  No, we didn't because we think
that's unconstitutional.  Our constitutional claim here
is the ministry of truth has no ability to judge our
political speech as falsity.  So obviously, we wouldn't
have subjected ourselves voluntarily to the ministry of
truth before we decided to challenge their
constitutional validity.  Then we would have been
inflicting the constitutional injury on ourselves.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. -- please.
MR. CARVIN:  I was just going to say, even
the Commission recognizes that the declaratory judgment
advisory opinion procedure doesn't work in the heat of
an election campaign as it was here.  But please --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is -- is your argument
dependent on the following two facts:  The first that
there was a probable cause determination, and the second
that the Susan Anthony group and the other group wanted
to repeat the exact same statement?  Are those the two
things that -- that ground your argument?
MR. CARVIN:  We -- we think that makes it
all -- all but dispositive, yes.  That it's possible not
to find a credible threat given those two facts.  They
had found this speech probably violated the Ohio
election statute.  And two, we were going to say exactly
the same thing.  So --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So if -- I'm sorry.
MR. CARVIN:  Well, I just want to make it
clear that the threat of enforcement is particularly
acute here because not only is -- is enforcement power
handed to a group of elected officials with certain
ethical and political accountability things.  Any one of
our political opponents is -- is empowered under the
statute to bring us in front of the Commission.  So all
they have to do is Xerox the Driehaus complaint, Xerox
the probable cause finding, and Xerox a district court
finding that said our speech was untrue.  So since there
is millions of people who were deputized under the
statute, who have every political motivation to squelch
our speech in -- before a campaign, then I think --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that would suggest
something even broader.  That would suggest that even in
the first instance, before the probable cause
determination was made, Susan Anthony would know that
it's going to be speaking about a very controversial
subject in which some people will think it's telling the
truth and other people will think it's lying, and that
there's a very good chance that somebody is going to
bring this to the Commission.  So that would suggest
that they have standing even at that moment before the
initial probable cause determination is made.
MR. CARVIN:  Justice Kagan, we can agree
that given the amorphous nature of this prohibition in
the false statement, it's difficult to predict in
advance who and when is going to do it.  But to return
to my prior answer, all of that ambiguity is gone once
the expert agency has already told you that there's a
probable cause to believe it violates it.
So this separates us from every other
speaker who is simply concerned that they will be
brought in front of the Commission.  We have an
identifiable track record that we have been brought in
front of the Commission.  And in that regard, I would
point out that the Secretary of State is obliged to
refer anything to the Commission if he has -- should
know that there's a violation.
Well, in the wake of the Probable Cause
Panel's prior probability determination, it would seem
that he's either ethically obliged to file a complaint
against us or at least there's a very high likelihood
that he would.  And, again, I don't want us to lose
sight of the other side of the calculus, which is that
if -- if we have to prove all of these hypotheticals
with certainty, if we have to engage in more the
presumption that the State will enforce its own laws,
you have created an insoluble dilemma for speakers,
because you have -- you have conditioned their access to
the political marketplace of ideas on a very serious
threat of being dragged into this process.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, let me ask you
something going back in part to Justice Kagan.
Basically, as a bottom line, you think there's nothing
that could be salvaged from this process.  Presumably,
you think that even if your client speaks a falsehood,
it still chills improperly.
MR. CARVIN:  We think that if the commission
is going to drag us in front of them to justify our
political speech to a bunch of State officials that
they -- that is, A, Article III cognizable injury, and
B, unconstitutional.  I was explaining to
Justice Ginsburg --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're -- you're not asking
us to resolve the constitutional question, just the
question of whether you can raise the Constitution.
MR. CARVIN:  All we're trying for is our day
in court so that we can make this argument.  And I was
just explaining to Justice Ginsburg that that's a reason
we wouldn't voluntarily invoke a procedure that we are
about to challenge as constitutional.  It would be
cutting off our nose to spite our face.
And -- and I also would like to point out
that this is election speech.  And -- and that has two
very significant components to it.  One is that it's
obviously the core of the First Amendment.  This is how
we choose our representatives in our democracy.  But it
also has an extraordinarily short shelf life.  No one is
listening to election speech hardly at all 60 days
before an election, and the day after the election no
one either speaks or listens.  So you have about a
2-month window where you can make these election speech
points, which means two things.  One is any distraction
during that crucial period, as this Court noted in
Wisconsin Right to Life, really does constitute a
serious Article III injury.
But the other point is you're never going to
be able to adjudicate it within that 60-day window,
right?  You're never going to go from complaint to final
judgment, which means that the speech will become
arguably moot after the election, in which case you go
to the capable of repetition yet evading review
exception to mootness, which is essentially the same
kind of prediction of future activity that's implicated
here.
If you adopt the extraordinarily Draconian
requirements that the Sixth Circuit imposed on credible
threat, this means that you will literally never be able
to challenge restrictions on election speech, right?
Before the campaign it will be premature.  During the
enforcement proceeding, Federal courts have to abstain
under Younger.  And afterwards, it'll be deemed moot,
and then no -- no possibility of capable of repetition
yet evading review.  So you have this -- this regime
which has existed for decades in Ohio, where they
continue to impose very serious burdens on speakers on
what we consider a facially unconstitutional law, yet it
has consistently evaded judicial review precisely
because of the short time frames of the election --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why did -- why did you
say it would be found capable -- not capable of
repetition?  It seems to me that you were quite right to
say before that this is most capable of repetition.
MR. CARVIN:  Oh, if you accept our view of
credible threat, then -- then you're -- you're entirely
right, we would -- we would satisfy both the ripeness
standard and the capable of repetition yet evading
review standard.  What I was trying to point out was
that if you adopt the what we consider absurdly high
straitjacket that the Sixth Circuit imposed on speakers
trying to bring pre-enforcement challenges in the First
Amendment context, that will essentially guarantee that
these things are never brought, because by the time the
election is done then you will have a mootness argument
and you won't be able to satisfy the capable of
repetition yet evading review standard.  So you will --
you will have put us in this Catch 22 endless cycle of
suppressing speech, deterring speech, chilling speech,
but never being able to get to a court to adjudicate our
First Amendment --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your best cases you think
are Steffel and Thompson and Babbitt?  Are there others
that are more --
MR. CARVIN:  Well, Babbitt is certainly the
most on point because there the prohibition was, like
ours, was saying something untrue, something false.  And
it's very important to note that the plaintiff in
Babbitt neither specified what they were going to say in
the future; it didn't specify what company it was going
to bring this consumer publicity campaign against; and
it expressly disavowed any intention to say anything
false.  But nonetheless, the Court found that "a
credible threat was certainly impending," was the phrase
they used.
And I also think the Court's recent decision
in Holder is -- is quite on point there.  There the
plaintiffs didn't say that they were subject to the
statute.  They adamantly denied that the statute even
read -- reached them.  They weren't bringing a facial
challenge as we are.  They were bringing an as-applied
challenge to the statute and there had never been a
prior threat by any expert agency that their activities
were going to be monitored.
I think American Booksellers is an excellent
case as well, Justice Kennedy.  There there had been no
argument -- there had been no prior threat of
enforcement.  The State absolutely denied --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So please -- please
define for me the rule you'd like us to announce?
What's a credible threat?
MR. CARVIN:  The narrowest rule, and the
only rule we need to survive, is that if the enforcement
agency has previously announced that your speech
probably violates the law at issue, then you have a
credible threat of future enforcement if you repeat that
speech.  I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do we need them to say
they are going to, even though the person who they said
it against is not running again?
MR. CARVIN:  Oh.  Well, two points on that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And how do you deal with
Golden, in other words?
MR. CARVIN:  Oh, yeah.  Well, Golden was
very simple.  All the speaker there was concerned about
was that one representative.  We are not concerned about
Representative Driehaus as such.  We're concerned about
people who supported the ACA's taxpayer-funded abortion,
which is a politically salient issue to this day.  We
mentioned Representative Kaptur as well as
Representative Driehaus in one of the false statements
that's already been brought in front of the commission.
And in 2010, Sherrod Brown was on the ballot for the
Senate and he also was an ACA supporter.
So our complaint was not candidate specific.
It didn't turn on any personal attribute of
Representative Driehaus.  It turned on people who were
supporting the ACA because of its taxpayer funding
abortion provisions.  And that remained politically
salient and candidates who had engaged in precisely the
same act as Representative Driehaus were on the ballot
again in -- in 2012.  So that -- that is our basic
argument.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that you've been
prosecuted before and that you are intending to do the
identical speech against others.
MR. CARVIN:  A preliminary finding and
identical speech we think more than satisfies the
credible threat thing for the reasons I was articulating
to Justice Kennedy a few moments ago.  We think this far
exceeds the showing that was required in Holder,
Babbitt, American Booksellers, and a number of other
cases as well.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you think this is a
matter of standing or ripeness?  The Sixth Circuit said
ripeness.
MR. CARVIN:  In all candor, Justice
Ginsburg, I can't figure out the difference between
standing and ripeness in this context.  No question that
we are being subject to something.  I think the question
is whether or not the threat is sufficiently immediate.
I think people tend to think about that as a ripeness
issue, but I think all of the Court's teachings on
standing and immediacy of injury from the standing cases
apply equally here.  So I would view standing and
ripeness in this context as essentially coextensive.
And I think the Sixth Circuit was wrong for both
reasons.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you want us to
just forget about the disclaimer issue and the
commission procedure issue or even the as-applied issue?
I got the sense from particularly footnote 7 in your
reply brief that you're happy to just have those taken
off the board.
MR. CARVIN:  Well, can we take them one at a
time?  The disclaimer issue, Ohio agreed with us.  So I
think they took that off the table.
The procedure issue is inextricably
intertwined with our Alvarez argument, that being
subject to a process where the -- the State is
determining the truth of our speech, we weren't saying
the procedures in the abstract were problematical.
In terms of the as-applied challenge, we do
disagree with the Solicitor General.  We think that's
certainly fit for review just as the as-applied
challenge was in Holder and in American Booksellers and
in Babbitt.  I do in candor, and I think this is what
the footnote the Chief Justice was referring to goes to
-- as a practical matter, we don't care.  Frankly, the
as-applied challenge was basically saying, look, even
if -- even if the law is constitutional as applied to
basic assertions of fact, it's not constitutional as
applied to opinions.
We think Alvarez has essentially eliminated
that distinction because the speech at issue in Alvarez
was a pure assertion of fact.  Frankly, the district
court that we're going to go back to if we prevail here
has already ruled that our interpretation of the ACA was
an assertion of fact.  So as a practical matter, it has
no consequence.  We're going to go back, make a facial
challenge that (B)(9) and (B)(10) are facially
unconstitutional under Alvarez.  There's no -- we're not
asking for any savings, constructions or -- or limited
application.  So it will be a pure question of law that
is fit for immediate review.  And as I say, we need --
if we do prevail here on justiciability, we need to get
relief right away because we have yet another election
cycle approaching.
Unless there are further questions, I'll
reserve the remainder of my time.  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Feigin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PARTIAL REVERSAL
MR. FEIGIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
I'd like to begin, if I could, by addressing
Justice Kagan's question, which Justice Sotomayor then
followed up on.  We think that the probable cause
finding and the fact that they want to repeat
essentially the speech that was made earlier are the two
critical factors in this case and without that, none of
their claims would be justiciable.  As it is, we think
that their purely legal First Amendment challenges are
ripe for those particular case-specific reasons.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you -- you
insist that they -- there has actually been a probable
cause finding that their speech would violate the law
before they would have standing?
MR. FEIGIN:  Not necessarily that their
particular speech would violate the law, but that there
have been -- without the probable cause finding, it
would simply be speculative whether particular speech
would actually result in any sort of enforcement
proceeding.
One critical aspect of this case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even in a case like
this, where the procedures can be triggered by any
citizen in the State?
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, again, we
don't think that someone can come into court and say, I
want to make some speech, I don't think that speech
would be violating the statute, I don't have any good
evidence that anyone else thinks my speech would violate
the statute or that some sort of enforcement action
would be brought against me, but nevertheless, I want to
get into court --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that a realistic
proposition?  I mean, first of all, in the first place,
surely you don't expect them to come in and say, I'm
going to say something totally false and I'm afraid I
might be prosecuted for that.  But then you have to say
they have -- you would never imagine that somebody else
might think in a hotly contested election that their
speech is false?
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, we may be
simply debating how similar the previous speech that was
a subject of a probable cause finding, or that there's
some other reason to believe will be the subject of an
enforcement proceeding has to be to the speech that the
plaintiffs allege that they intend to make.  But we
definitely don't think that a plaintiff can simply come
into court and say, look, I want to make this speech, I
don't think it violates the law.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what would happen,
Mr. Feigin, what would happen if a candidate knew -- it
seems actually quite plausible that Representative
Driehaus would know -- that this was something that
Susan Anthony or some other like group would talk about
in his campaign, and he were to write letters to all
these groups saying, if you start advertising in this
way, if you put up billboards, I'm going to take you
before the Ohio Commission.  Would that be sufficient?
MR. FEIGIN:  That would at least be
sufficient, Your Honor, to bring a suit against
Driehaus.  That would be kind of similar to the
situation in MedImmune v. Genentech, which was a civil
suit that the putative defendant had standing to bring a
declaratory judgment action to prevent --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not sure I understood
that.  Is it sufficient that somebody has said, I'm
going to bring an action against -- before the
Commission, but there's been no prior Commission
determination as to this speech.  And it's just somebody
saying, I'm going to go to the Commission and raise this
with them if you start speaking in this way.  Would that
present a credible threat?
MR. FEIGIN:  That specific threat would be
enough to allow for a lawsuit.  And, Your Honor, I think
there'd be a significant question whether the suit could
only be brought against Driehaus, who brought the
threat, or whether you could also join in the
Commission.  But as a practical matter, that wouldn't
really make much difference because if constitutional
claims were raised in that proceeding, the district
court would be obligated to inform the State of Ohio and
the State of Ohio would be entitled to intervene in the
litigation.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, take it just a step
further.  Surely, there are some kinds of statements or
-- I don't know.  Maybe "surely" is the wrong word.  Are
there some kinds of statements where, even though the --
the representative doesn't say, I'm going to do this,
you know that somebody is going to do this, whether the
representative or somebody else?  It's the kind of
statement that, given this process, it's just going to
require too much fortitude to resist the temptation to
bring this in front of this Commission.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think in
the absence of good evidence of an enforcement
proceeding, it would simply be too speculative.  But I
would add that in this particular case, the credible
threat of enforcement test might be relaxed to a certain
extent, because this is a private attorney general
statute.  And the entire point of private attorney
general statutes is to allow for enforcement in a wider
range of circumstances than would be possible under most
Federal laws, for example, which are enforced solely by
the executive.  That might be a reason, a case-specific
reason why your hypothetical might have more salience
here than it would in the Federal context.
Another difference between this and the
Federal context is we don't have any potential statutory
barriers to bringing this action.  Congress hasn't
decided to provide a cause of action only for a -- for,
for example, final agency action, as it did in the
Administrative Procedure Act, and it's not attempting to
channel these claims through a particular agency.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you arguing that the
other organization, COAST, also has standing?  Because
you -- you seem to require for the credible threat for
there to have been a proceeding before the Commission
and there's been nothing with regard to the other
organization.
MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, we don't think that
the proceeding before the Commission has to involve the
entity that wants to make the speech in the future.
It's enough that it involves speech similar to the
speech that the plaintiff is alleging that the plaintiff
intends to make.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So how do you distinguish
the three in Younger v. Harris that the Court said
didn't have standing?
MR. FEIGIN:  I think in the same way the
Petitioners do, Your Honor, and I think that's how we
reconcile the case with Steffel, where one of the
factors the Court looked to, to find a credible threat
of enforcement in that case was the actual prosecution
of the plaintiff's hand-billing companion.
One thing I would emphasize about this case
is that in this particular context, this unique Ohio
scheme, the administrative proceedings before the Ohio
Elections Commission are the relevant enforcement
proceedings.  It wouldn't normally be the case that
administrative proceedings that can result only in
government speech would be considered enforcement
proceedings for that purpose.  But in this particular
circumstance, not only can the Ohio Elections Commission
recommend a case for further prosecution, but a decision
by the Ohio Elections Commission is a decision by a
neutral decision maker following a full-dress adversary
proceeding that someone has violated Ohio criminal law
by knowingly misinforming the electorate in the context
of a political campaign.
In that particular context, and particularly
as to entities like Petitioners that engage in political
advocacy on a regular basis, that kind of finding is a
significant sanction.  And, in fact, the State itself
views it that way in two relevant ways.  First of all,
such a finding by the Commission is treated as an
adverse effect for purposes of the statute that allows
for judicial review.  And second of all, if you look at
actual orders by the Ohio Elections Commission, they
sometimes refer to the finding of a violation in
particular cases as a penalty.
Before my time is up, I would like to
address a few things Petitioner said about the
justiciability, for example, of as-applied challenges
under this Court's decision in Holder.  I think it's
very significant that in Holder, the Court noted that
there were -- Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project -- the
Court noted that there had been 150 prosecutions brought
under the statute that the plaintiffs in that case were
challenging and that many of them had involved the same
provision.  And we think that's a circumstance in which
there would be a credible threat of prosecution because
the plaintiffs had showed a pattern or practice of
prosecution of similar conduct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How many proceedings
have been brought under this Ohio statute?
MR. FEIGIN:  So under the Ohio statute
between 2001 and 2010, according to the statistics in
the green brief by the Ohio Attorney General, it's a
little bit over 500.  And that's just for violations of
this False-Statement Law or asserted violations of this
False-Statement Law.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Any -- any breakdown of
whether those were brought by candidates or just
interested citizens?
MR. FEIGIN:  The -- we don't have statistics
on that, Your Honor.  The brief doesn't break it down.
If the Court has no further questions, we'd
ask the Court to partially reverse and allow only the
purely legal ripe, legal challenge to these laws to
proceed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Murphy?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC E. MURPHY
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MURPHY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Court should affirm the Sixth Circuit's
judgment in this case because Petitioners have not
established a credible threat of criminal prosecution
and any other injury, to the extent it is adequately
alleged, is not certainly impending.  And I'd like to
begin with the prior probable cause finding.
Petitioners repeatedly characterized the
prior probable cause finding as a finding by the prior
panel that the -- the speech at issue there was probably
criminal.  That's not what the finding indicated.  It's
a very, very low standard.  It's not a standard that --
it's -- it's well below a preponderance of the evidence,
so "probably criminal" is way too high.  It's just --
it's analogous in the civil context to -- to a malicious
prosecution case; one of the elements is to establish
that a prior case lacked probable cause.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you ready --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you have to admit
that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you prepared to
represent to us that if they do the exact same thing the
next election that they did in the last one, that you
will not take action against them?
MR. MURPHY:  No, I'm not -- I have not -- I
do not have authority to disavow.  But their -- their
argument that you need to disavow is inconsistent with
some of the Court's cases suggesting that the threat
implied by the existence of a law itself is not
sufficient.  And so they -- they fall back on this
probable cause finding as suggesting that it creates the
objective evidence necessary.  But because -- because
the probable cause finding is so low and because there
are so many steps between the probable cause finding and
the potential criminal prosecution --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but the criminal
prosecution isn't all that they're complaining about.
They're complaining about having -- having to be dragged
through this same -- this same proceeding next time in
the midst of an election campaign, and however minimal
the finding that is ultimately made may be, they are
going to be subject, for sure, to that proceeding in the
next election campaign.
And I don't care if all the commission says
is, you know, there is some reason to believe that they
were lying.  Even if it's that minimal, you are forcing
them, and it is pretty sure that it's going to happen
because somebody will complain, the candidate they are
criticizing, you are forcing them to go through this
procedure in the midst of an election campaign, right?
MR. MURPHY:  Well, with respect, Your Honor,
I think there is a couple of answers.  First off, I
think it's speculative.  If you look at the complaints,
the SBA List complaint simply says they would like to
engage in substantially similar activity in the future.
Now, you have to keep in mind what that activity was.
They weren't challenging anybody who voted for the
Affordable Care Act.  They were challenging specific
congressmen.  At JA-113, it says certain congressmen.
That's in their complaint.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Their organization is not
an anti-Driehaus -- is that his name, "Driehaus"?
MR. MURPHY:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not what they are
about.  They are about opposition to the abortion
funding portion of the Affordable Care Act and they're
going to make the same, the same contentions against
anybody else who runs for office who has voted for that
Act, whether it's Driehaus or anybody else.
MR. MURPHY:  Well, with respect, the people
that they targeted in 2010 were only pro-life Democrats
who originally voted against the Act and then changed
their vote in response to the executive order.  This is
at JA-52 when they announced their Votes
Have Consequences Bus Tour.  It wasn't against everybody
who voted for the Act.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your very argument,
Mr. Murphy, to the effect that, well, probable cause is
a very low standard, seems to me to work against you.
It means that more complaints are more likely.
MR. MURPHY:  Well, it depends on what you
are talking about the relevant injury is.  If the
relevant injury is a criminal prosecution, I think it
very much shows that a prosecution is entirely unlikely.
And if your relevant injury is some of these preliminary
injuries that they're asserting, I do think that the
credible threat test is probably not even the test
because, as the Court said in Clapper, injuries in that
context had to be certainly impending.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but this is a point
brought up by Justice Scalia's question as well.  Don't
you think there's a serious First Amendment concern with
a state law that requires you to come before a
commission to justify what you are going to say and
which gives the commission discovery power to find out
who's involved in your association, what research you've
made, et cetera?
MR. MURPHY:  Well, remember that the issue
here is standing, so setting aside the -- the First
Amendment concern should have no impact into whether an
Article III case or controversy exists.  They would --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  Why?
MR. MURPHY:  Because --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why can't a person say, you
know, there are things I want to say politically, and
the Constitution says that the State does not have the
right to abridge my speech, and I intend to say them.
And if I say them, there's a serious risk that I will be
had up before a commission and could be fined.  What's
the harm?  I can't speak.  That's the harm.  Right?  So
why isn't that end of the matter?
MR. MURPHY:  Well, the Court -- the Court --
the Court -- has repeatedly said that chilling effect by
itself is not the harm.  The relevant harm in your hypo
would be --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why shouldn't it be the
harm?  That is, whatever -- has any case said when
somebody says, we’re going to take an extreme, you want to speak in a
campaign, and we
have a law here that if you do we will throw you in jail
and you really do want to speak and the law really does
prevent you from speaking, why shouldn't that be the end
of it?
MR. MURPHY:  Well, remember the test has to
be a credible threat of prosecution.  What the Court --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I'm saying is there a
statute -- not a statute.  Is there a case which says
the little syllogism I just went through is not the law
of the United States?  Now, there may be.  That's why I
asked the question.
MR. MURPHY:  So I think the closest case
would be Golden, for instance, where the Court clearly
indicated, and I quote, "The constitutional question,
First Amendment or otherwise, must arise in the context
of a specific live grievance."
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that was a very
special situation.  In Golden they were going out after
a particular candidate.  It was not -- it was not a
political view that an organization is taking, and they
are not targeting this particular candidate, but they
are targeting that issue, any candidate who supports
that issue.
MR. MURPHY:  Well, with respect, Your Honor,
in Golden the plaintiff clearly indicated that he was
targeting that congressman because of the congressman's
votes on -- for a particular care package.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But didn't the Court say
that there wasn't -- once that congressman wasn't going
to run for office any more, there was no suggestion that
they wanted to talk about somebody else.
MR. MURPHY:  So he did have suggestions that
he wanted to engage in substantially similar leafletting
in the future, and the Court found them too speculative
because he had only identified that one congressman.
And so I think that's significant because I think by
analogy that would suggest that the only single
forward-looking allegations in SBA List's complaint at
JA-122 are that it plans to engage in substantially
similar activity in the future, but they don't identify
any other candidates, just like they didn't identify any
other candidates in Golden, just like they didn't
identify any candidates in the Renne decision, which was
part of the reason why the Court found the decision --
that case right there.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Murphy, you said
there was no credible threat of prosecution, but what
about the harm that is occurring?  Mr. Carvin said it's
a very short time.  They're brought before the
commission, they have to answer this charge that they
lied, that they made a false statement.  And that just
that alone is going to diminish the effect of their
speech because they have been labeled false speakers,
and it costs money to defend before the commission,
right?  That's not --
MR. MURPHY:  Well, keep in mind that the
reputational harm they have essentially asserted for the
first time in this Court.  They didn't assert any type
of reputational injuries in the Sixth Circuit.  And I
think it would be entirely speculative to suggest that
those would exist here with respect to these
organizations.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I'm not sure it's a
reputational harm.  I mean, why isn't, as Justice
Ginsburg suggested, the relevant harm the probable cause
determination itself?  There are voters out there and
they don't know that probable cause is such a low bar as
you describe it.  They think probable cause means you
probably lied, and that seems a reasonable thing for
them to think and that's a relevant harm and we
should just -- you know, we don't even need the
prosecution to serve as the relevant harm.  That seems
quite enough.
MR. MURPHY:  They -- they did not rely on
any type of that type of harm below and I think -- a
harm flowing from the misrepresentation of what the
probable cause finding means -- I would think you would
have to allege more than they have here with respect
to -- that it would exist in this case.
There was no -- they hadn't -- there was no
misrepresentations by SBA List, for instance, that this
probable cause finding meant that they probably lied.
They told their supporters -- it's in the joint appendix
at 74 and 75 -- that all it meant was that you go --
that they found that you have to go before the full
commission.  They didn't say to their supporters that
you probably lied.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess it was in
the case of COAST; the problem is other people are going
to be intimidated from helping them engage in their
political speech.  What was it, a billboard?  The
billboard company said --
MR. MURPHY:  No more advertising.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- I'm not going to
let you put your sign up on my billboard, I might be
liable.  So, I mean, they may have a certain fortitude
and proceeding based on all the reasons that you've
given, but they need third parties to help carry out
their message and there is no reason to think those
third parties have any commitment to their political
message at all and the slightest whiff of, oh, this is
going to be legal trouble, they say, forget about it.
MR. MURPHY:  I guess two responses.  Keep in
mind that at JA-27 in the letter to Lamar, Driehaus
indicated essentially that we reserve the right to
proceed against you in the commission or in a court of
law, indicating that he was already contemplating a
defamation action.  So if this statute -- talking about
the redressability prong of standing or the directness
test with respect to ripeness, he could have said the
exact same thing and it would have chilled them Lamar
from --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no, but a
defamation action, people sue everybody all the time.
No one's going to take that seriously.  In fact, it's
probably going to redound to the benefit of SBA and
COAST to say the congressman is, you know, bringing a
defamation action.  It highlights it, but it's another
thing to have the State involved making a determination
that there's probable cause that you lied.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The mere fact that a
private individual can chill somebody's speech does not
say, well, since a private individual can do it, you
know, the ministry of truth can do it.  That's not --
that's not the law.
MR. MURPHY:  Well, the law -- so that's the
First Amendment question, it seems to me.  On the
standing question, it's whether this harm would have
come up -- can't come about absent this law, and the
fact that he notified the company that they might be
thinking about a defamation action suggests that it's
entirely speculative that it would have come about
absent this law.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There's a curious
inversion here.  Usually we're concerned about citizen
suits, too many people can challenge -- challenge the
law.  Here we're concerned that many, many citizens can
bring the challenge against the candidate.  So it's
somewhat reversed.  In other words, you have tens of
thousands of private attorney generals waiting to pounce
and get these people before the commission and have to
follow discovery orders.
MR. MURPHY:  Well, I mean, that's true.  But
keep in -- keep in mind that there -- when you -- when
you think about the fundamental Article III purposes
here, separation of powers and federalism purposes, it
seems to me that a finding in -- in this case that they
have standing would undermine those.  With respect to
separation of powers, the Court has repeatedly said that
courts are not -- in our constitutional system are not
roving commissions designed -- assigned to pass judgment
on the validity of the nation of laws, and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you know of the 500
cases that you mentioned earlier, how many actually
ended up in full prosecutions?
MR. MURPHY:  So there's -- since 1996, when
the statute was amended to allow for this
pre-enforcement process, there have been five referrals,
and then of those five referrals, three plea agreements.
So there's only been three --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Three what?  I'm sorry.
MR. MURPHY:  Three plea agreements at the
end of -- so there was five referrals from the
Commission to the relevant prosecutor, and then -- and
of those five cases, three charges were brought and plea
agreements were essentially entered immediately.
So that -- that just also goes to show that
the credible threat of any criminal prosecution is very
unlikely.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how many of
those do you know were mooted out by the election?
MR. MURPHY:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, the
proceedings are going on and people's speech is being
chilled and it's back and forth, then the election is
over, and people say, oh, forget about it.
MR. MURPHY:  How many of the overall number
of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  500.  You gave us
some answers about how many of the 500 resulted in
criminal prosecutions.  And all I want to know is how
many of the 500 proceedings were mooted out by the fact
that the election took place.
MR. MURPHY:  So I -- so roughly 40
percent -- 60 percent, there's a finding of no probable
cause.  That leaves 40 percent.  And of those, I -- you
know, Your Honor, I don't know the statistics on the
number of dismissals.  I would say that there are
substantial number of --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What would you say as a
lawyer -- you're now a lawyer for the Commission.  You
understand it better than I.  I'm just making up an
example.  Do you think they'd prosecute this or not?
Somebody walks in front of the House of a political
opponent has a big sign that says murderer.  Now when
asked, you said but he voted for legislation that led
to the death of many cats.  Would they prosecute that or
not?
MR. MURPHY:  Well, I think, Your Honor, it
might fall within -- it -- it depends on the scope of
the statute --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I just want to know your
opinion as the lawyer for the Commission, do you think
that's going to be prosecuted or not?
MR. MURPHY:  I think the -- I would say
probably not, but -- but that's just my --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Probably not.
MR. MURPHY:  -- personal opinion.  Because
they would say that you -- you would adopt the rule from
the defamation context, that if -- if it can be
interpreted under -- either as a hyperbole or either as
a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statement or
were the -- but if -- if there's any interpretation of
the statement that is ambiguous, where it's true, it
would fall within the defamation rule that it can't be
considered false within the meaning of the statute.  So
the murder hypo, if it's actually he is a murderer of
cats, it might -- it might mean that it's misleading.
But by --
this here?
JUSTICE BREYER:  But why did they prosecute
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yeah.  Why wasn't that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, we've heard in
other cases, you know, just recently, a very major case,
where people really believed about the same thing and
they were sincere in their beliefs.  So why --
MR. MURPHY:  The commissioner has now fully
conceded that it would be a difficult proposition in
this case, certainly.  But I -- I think it's the very
nature of the probable cause finding that is --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why don't the
statistics that you provided us portray a system that
really limits core First Amendment speech without
providing much of an opportunity for a judicial review
if you're correct about -- about Article III here
where -- you have a system where thousands of complaints
are filed, and yet in the end, there's very few
prosecutions.  And you say, well, the filing of the
complaint isn't enough and the probable cause
determination isn't enough.  So you have this system that
goes on and on, year after year, where arguably there's
a great chilling of -- of core First Amendment speech,
and yet you're saying that basically you can't get into
Federal court.
MR. MURPHY:  Well, we're not saying that,
Your Honor.  I think we're just saying you can't get
into Federal court in this case.  And I do think that
this -- those chilling effect concerns should not play a
role in the Article III cases or controversy --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but how would you
get into Federal court?  I mean, your own office
expresses grave concern about the constitutionality of
this statute.  So that suggests somebody should be able
to get into Federal court to do this.  But I don't see a
way where you would allow a pre-enforcement challenge.
One would have to go through the entire process and get
to the end of it and get a judgment to enable a
challenge under your theory; is that right?
MR. MURPHY:  Well, I think under our theory,
it really depends.  There's two types of cases that are
brought.  One is a case like Babbitt, where they're
saying the law is ambiguous, it could mean A or it
could -- it could mean B.  If it means A, my speech is
covered within it.  There, all you essentially have to
do is allege you want to engage in the speech that would
fall within the rule.  But that's not what they're doing
here.  They're saying their speech falls completely
outside this law, this unambiguous law, the distinctions
between false and true, but we're going to get
prosecuted anyways.  And in that context, I think you do
have to allege what the government suggested is more
objective evidence that you're going to be prosecuted
outside --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I had a reason for asking
what sounds like a silly hypothetical, but a possible
one.  We understand how people take different views on
that.  And then you have a hard time, it seems to me,
distinguishing this case from that one in terms of their
exercising their authority.  And so at least it must
raise a question, a First Amendment question on the
merits.  It seems pretty serious.  So if you lose on
this procedural matter, how quickly can you get this
decided?  I mean, there are elections coming up.  People
would like to know.  They want to know what they're
supposed to say.  And how long is all this procedural
skirmishing going to take, which in and of itself is an
obstacle to what they might say in the next election?
MR. MURPHY:  So procedural skirmishing,
you're talking about within --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, you're saying,
well, they don't have standing -- you know, I was
interested in this field, administrative law, and even
my class, despite the scintillation, would sometimes go
to sleep when I got to such questions.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so I'm saying that
these seem to be preliminary questions on a matter in
respect to which there seems serious doubt.  I'll repeat
myself.  The elections are coming up.  And people have
to know what they're supposed to say and what they can
say and what they can't.  So how do we get this decided?
MR. MURPHY:  Well, it seems to me your
question is the -- your question is suggesting that the
underlying law is -- is -- there's serious doubts about
the constitutionality of the underlying law.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It is suggesting that. I agree, it is suggesting that.
MR. MURPHY:  And that provides -- that
doesn't provide any basis.  The entire purposes of
Article III's case or controversy requirement is to
ensure that courts only decide constitutional questions
in concrete cases.  And to allow the merits to slip into
the Article III question fundamentally undermines
the separation of powers --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I would say one of
the purposes of standing is to allow people who are
really going to be hurt to be able to be heard in
court.  Well, of course, if they're not going to be
hurt, there's no reason.  And what the merits
discussion is designed to suggest is that there are real
people who would really like to speak in an election
campaign.  And if they feel they can't, they are really
being hurt.  That's what the other side is arguing.  And
I've listened to the argument.  I'm curious as to the
practicalities.  If they're right, when is this going to
be heard and decided in your opinion?
MR. MURPHY:  So the -- are you talking if
there's a remand in the district court, or --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You tell me how to do it.
MR. MURPHY:  Well, I think that case should
be dismissed, obviously.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm saying if you were to
lose on the --
MR. MURPHY:  Okay.  If I was to lose?  Oh,
you could -- frankly, if you remanded finding a concrete
case here, you could instruct the district court to
certify to the Ohio Supreme Court, for instance, which
could give an immediate authoritative interpretation of
the law and it could -- it could include all the
relevant narrowing constructions that this Court has
adopted --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that will
speed things up.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't even
want -- you don't even want the district court to decide
it.  You want to go through a certification process that
will bring in a whole another court system.
MR. MURPHY:  But it has to decide the scope
of a law.  As the United States v. Williams said, to
determine the constitutionality of the law, you need to
know its scope.  And -- and the entire suggestion here
that their speech is covered suggests that the scope --
or the scope of the law is much broader than the Ohio
Supreme Court could interpret it to be.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what -- what narrowing
construction would be consistent with Alvarez?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah, what?  I can't
understand what that would be.  It has to be really
false.  Is that it?
(Laughter.)
MR. MURPHY:  Well, I think -- I think -- I
think Alvarez is completely distinguishable as being
about false statements in the abstract.  This Court
already held in McIntyre that the State has a compelling
interest in policing fraud and libelous statements
in the election context because of the risk to the
public from those statements.  And Mark Twain --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Alvarez wasn't about
false statements in the abstract.  It was a criminal
prosecution for making particular false statements.  And
they were as hard factual statements as you will ever
find.  Did somebody receive the Congressional Medal of
Honor or not?
MR. MURPHY:  No, I agree with that.  There
was a false statement of a verifiable -- verifiable
fact, but it was a false statement anywhere, anytime;
even like at home, if you make the statement, it could
be covered.  What we're saying here is that false
statements in the election context, the State has a much
more compelling interest in that context because, as
the Court said in McIntyre, the -- the false statements
can have an impact on the election.
Of course, there's false positives if the
commission gets it wrong.  But think about the false --
false negatives that slip through when somebody is
making a false statement, and that actually impacts a
campaign, leading to somebody voting for somebody else.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But how are you going to
prove -- how are you ever going to prove that one false
statement cost somebody an election?
MR. MURPHY:  What's that?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How are you ever going
to prove that one false statement cost somebody an
election?
MR. MURPHY:  Well, I don't think we -- I
don't think we have to prove that to get a conviction in
any case.  I think we just prove that their false
statements can have impacts on elections, and that shows
the interest in this case, as compared to the interest
in Alvarez, in which the false statements could be made
at any time, under any circumstances.  It wasn't -- it
wasn't narrowly tailored to the election context.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think that the
allegedly false statement here was a false statement of
fact?
MR. MURPHY:  I think there's a good argument
that it was not, that there was a false statement of --
that there's reasonable interpretations of this
ambiguous Affordable Care Act, and if so --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There's a good argument on
the other side.  But it's an argument over a fact, isn't
it, whether this person was responsible for the
Affordable Care Act.  I mean that was the charge, you
know, that this person made the decisive vote, right, in
the --
MR. MURPHY:  Well, that's a different case.
This charge was he voted for taxpayer-funded abortion,
was the -- was the charge.  And so it's whether this
Act --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But by voting -- by voting
for that Act.
MR. MURPHY:  For the Act, yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
MR. MURPHY:  So it's whether the Act covers
taxpayer-funded abortion, and that's a complex question
that if the court were to -- if the Ohio Supreme Court,
through certification, were to adopt the Bose standard,
it would suggest that it might not be covered because
the Bose standard suggests that speech about an
ambiguous topic cannot be false under the actual malice
standard.  So this whole -- this whole speech could be,
through certification, eliminated and the statute
narrowed to cover only false statements of verifiable
fact.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And then all you have to do
is litigate it.  That's all.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you make the
statement, and then, you know, you can litigate it on
the basis of whatever the Ohio Supreme Court says.
Right?
MR. MURPHY:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, let's litigate
whether it's factually inaccurate or legally inaccurate,
right?  It's a lawsuit.
MR. MURPHY:  So we're talking about the
scope of the law, correct?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, we are.  But I mean,
we're talking about whether this law imposes limitations
upon the freedom of speech.  And if you say whenever you
do it, you are going to have a lawsuit, you're going to
be hauled before this commission.  You may have a good
case, you may not have a good case, but you have to
justify yourself to this commission before you can --
before you can make the assertion.
MR. MURPHY:  Well, that's not true.  That
doesn't happen in every case.  It makes -- you're making
it sound like the commission hears every political
statement out there.  But it has to be filed by a
person, and only one person filed a complaint against
the SBA this last time, and he is in Africa now.  So I
don't think he'll be filing complaints any time soon.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He really lost, didn't he?
(Laughter.)
MR. MURPHY:  I see my time is up.  Could I
just ask the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Carvin, you have 5 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CARVIN:  A few brief points.  I think
the key point to take away from the colloquy with
Mr. Murphy is that when he was asked, How do you bring a
pre-enforcement challenge, his only solution was to
admit you're lying before you speak.  Well, obviously
that completely defeats the value of your speech.  No
speaker is ever going to do it.  You're not going to
confess to a crime before you speak.  And I would point
out in Babbitt they didn't say they were going to lie.
They said just the opposite, and they nonetheless had
standing.
On the certification point, further delay in
the Ohio Supreme Court for a limiting construction that
we don't want, that can't possibly do it.  After
Alvarez, this fact/opinion distinction is of no legal
relevance.  We don't want a limiting construction.  We
want to say that anything, fact or opinion, is
unconstitutional to limit under the false statement law.
I point out that we did litigate in front of
this very same district court judge the fact/opinion
issue in the libel case, where it does have some
resonance, and he's already found that our assertion was
factual.  So we don't want to go on that tangent.
If the Court would just look at them,
Browskins and Citizens United, those cases articulate as
well as any can, when you are making a facial challenge
to a First Amendment, the last thing you want to do is
abstain to State court judges because you actually
exacerbate the constitutional injury through the delay
and the fact that you've got to go through declaratory
judgments, when our entire point is it's
unconstitutional for us to say, "Mother, may I?" before
we speak.
As to Mr. Murphy's attempt to downplay the
probable cause finding, on 7A attached to their brief
they have what the probable cause finding is.  And it
says that there is probable cause to believe that
there's been a violation of the law alleged and that the
complaint has occurred.
Under this Court's probable cause
determination, that means reasonable people would
believe that a violation has occurred, even though you
need to show it by clear and convincing evidence, and
even though my opponent claims that any reasonable
interpretation of this law is not false.  Well, that
means that they've already found that through clear and
convincing evidence we are advancing not only a false,
but an unreasonable interpretation of the ACA, which
simply, of course, exacerbates the credible threat.
And I think my final point will be, he
says -- well, two things.  One is he says we didn't
allege with specificity the kind of speech that we were
going to say in the future.  We said we're going to
engage in the same or similar speech.  I don't think the
language, the English language, permits a more direct
and precise articulation of what we're going to say in
the future.
The only difference will be, instead of
Representative Driehaus, we will substitute
Representative Kaptur, another pro-life Democrat in Ohio
who we have already criticized for her vote on the ACA
and which we would have repeated in the 2012 election
cycle but for the chilling effect.
This is obviously completely different from
Golden, which my opponent continues to raise, where
the Court found that the only interpretation of the
facts is that the plaintiff's, quote, "sole concern" was
with the representative at issue, who had gone off to a
judgeship.
It is blazingly obvious that our sole
concern is not Representative Driehaus.  It is any
legislator that voted for an Act that we believe
devoutly has "taxpayer-funded" and "abortion" in it.
So we're facing a credible threat.  We ask
the Court to lift this yoke so that we can become full
participants in the next election cycle.
Unless there are any further questions, I
thank you.
