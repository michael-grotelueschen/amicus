CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 13-352, B&B Hardware v.
Hargis Industries.
Mr. Jay.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM JAY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JAY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Lanham Act contains only one concept of
likelihood of confusion.  That is why the two tribunals
in this case decided the same issue, and that is why
issue of preclusion is appropriate.  Whether a court is
considering registration or infringement or both at the
same time, the statutory test is the same, whether the
resemblance of the marks as used on particular goods
would give rise to a likelihood of confusion or mistake
or deceit.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Jay, there are
exceptions to preclusion even though you would see the
identical issue, and one of them is when the stakes are
higher in the second proceeding than in the first and,
indeed, the restatement of judgments gives some
examples of that.  And it seems to me this is such a
case, because it's one thing to say that we won't
register your mark and another to say you can't use the
mark.
MR. JAY:  There is an exception for when --
when the stakes are different, Justice Ginsburg, but I
think that the difference has to be a difference of an
order of magnitude greater than we're dealing with here.
So I think the best example in the restatement is the
example of a small claims court.  Small claims courts
are set up in such a way that their designers understand
their judgments won't be preclusive and that's what gets
people to litigate there.
Here the stakes are different, but I don't
think it can be said that the stakes before the
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board are so low.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't think that your
example of small claims court is the closest.  There's
one on section 83, which is determinations by an
administrative tribunal, and the example it gives is of
a scheme that contemplates an agency proceeding to be as
expeditious as possible.  And one way of assuring
expeditiousness is to confine the stakes to the matter
immediately in controversy.
MR. JAY:  The matter immediately in
controversy, though, in -- in this case, the matter is
the same and the -- the way that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The matter in controversy
is registration, and in the second proceeding, it's
infringement.
MR. JAY:  That's correct.  That's why
there's no claim preclusion, for example.  So in that
sense, they are different, but the inquiry that the two
tribunals are asking is the same.
And to say that the -- the stakes are
different, certainly, they're different, but I don't
think that they are sufficiently different that you can
infer from that that Congress wanted the trademark
board's judgments not to be preclusive.
And I would encourage the Court to think
about the ways in which the trademark board decides
issues that will be, I think everyone would agree,
exactly the same in subsequent litigation such as
priority.  Priority is the key to determining who gets
to register a mark, who's the senior mark, and who's --
and who's the junior mark.  The trademark board
frequently decides that factual question, who came
first, who started using it in commerce first.  And
there's no reason to think that Congress would want that
factual matter relitigated in a subsequent infringement
action without regard to the proceeding that's come
before.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, just --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose in one sense
the -- the trademark determination is broader rather
than narrower than the infringement determination,
right?  The infringement determination just applies to
one alleged infringer whereas the trademark registration
would register the trademark as against the world.  So
I'm not sure that it's terribly narrower.
MR. JAY:  Well, in the -- in an opposition
or cancellation proceeding, Justice Scalia, there --
there is a concrete dispute between the holders of two
marks.  But you're right that a registration is a right
nationwide as against the world that gives you
priority as of a certain date.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- but the person who
uses the mark could continue to use it.  And the reason
the restatement gives before the expeditious first
proceeding is that you don't want to make that
proceeding pull out all the stops because it's going to
be determinative of the infringement suit.
MR. JAY:  But I think you could say the
same, Justice Ginsburg, if the Trademark Trial and
Appeal Board's decision were appealed to a U.S. District
Court or to the Federal Circuit.  The stakes would be
the same.  The stakes would still be registration.
But I don't understand the other side to be
saying that that tribunal's judgment would not be
preclusive because -- because of a difference in the
stakes.  They're saying that the issues are different to
be sure.  They're saying that the legal issue of
confuse -- of likelihood of confusion in infringement
proceedings is different than the legal issue in
registration proceedings.
But I think once you get past that argument,
and I think the statute and the history and the
structure all dispatch that, then I think that the -- I
don't think that the notion that the stakes are
different can save Respondents from preclusion here.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Would you agree that if we
accept your argument, the number of cases in which the
elements of issue preclusion will be met by the TTAB
proceeding will be relatively rare?  And if that is the
case, is it worthwhile to create a rule that applies
only in that very limited set of circumstances?
MR. JAY:  I think, Justice Alito, that the
number of circumstances in which the -- our rule would
apply depends on the number of circumstances in which
people seek to register the same goods that they are
actually using.  Now, it's certainly true that sometimes
people file registrations for goods that they don't
intend to use and that their actual use in real life
will be different.
But I do think that for the 40-some odd
percent of registrations that are -- deal with marks
already in use, that generally, when an applicant comes
to the patent office and says, I'd like to register a
trademark for use on these goods, that it's the goods
that that person is already using.  So that under our
rule when the marks are the same, the goods are the
same, and they're sold in the same channels of commerce,
that's when it's appropriate for preclusion to apply.
And I don't think that that's such a
vanishingly small set of circumstances that you would
say the game isn't worth the candle.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have a bit of a
problem, okay?  We have held that in -- in Kappos last
year or two terms ago -- I've now lost track of time --
that an applicant who loses before the board can
introduce new evidence at the trial.  So we have made
the assumption that -- that an applicant doesn't have to
produce everything.  So what happens in the situation
when there is new evidence?  What kind of deference do
we owe then?  Is it -- that's why I think Justice Alito
said this might be a unique case because I -- then --
your adversary may tell me and tell me differently --
the two proceedings had almost identical evidence.
MR. JAY:  That is certainly our position,
that the proceedings were the same.  The only difference
Respondent has identified is this point about the
two-word phrase, "building fasteners," which I'd be
happy to come back to.
But I want to make sure I understand Your
Honor's question.  You're asking what the preclusive
effect of a district court's judgment would be if new
evidence is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  Just assume that
there's new evidence that they want to present at the
infringement trial.
MR. JAY:  Oh, I see.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's the charge
the court gives?  What deference does the court ask to
be given to the board in that situation?
MR. JAY:  I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It didn't have evidence
that existed before.
MR. JAY:  Well, I think that there are --
there are two different questions.  One is whether the
marks are the same, the goods are the same, and they're
being sold in the same channels of commerce, and
that's -- that is what would line up the infringement
proceeding with the registration proceeding.
And saying I have new evidence that I would
like to introduce that I didn't introduce before, you
have the option to go up to the district court on review
of the trademark board proceeding.  You always have that
option, and that's what -- that is the significance of
Kappos v. Hyatt.
If you don't take that option, I think you
should not expect in the infringement litigation to say,
well, preclusion doesn't apply merely because I think I
have some new evidence.
And that's a bedrock principle of the law on
judgments, that new evidence is not enough to get you
right to preclusion, but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're talking about
the effects of full preclusion.
MR. JAY:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you could have, you
should have.
MR. JAY:  If you could have, you should
have.  Now, there certainly will be -- there certainly
are matters that the trademark board will not
adjudicate, and there certainly are ways in which
infringement litigation can differ and that the simplest
way is if the goods are different.  So if you seek to
register a broad array of goods and the trademark board
finds a likelihood of confusion based on that broad
array of goods in your registration, but the
infringement action turns only on one -- you know, one
good within that set, jeans instead of all clothing, for
example, then I think preclusion wouldn't apply.  And
that's the way the Federal Circuit applies it going in
the opposite direction, that if infringement -- if
infringement -- that no confusion judgment turns only on
a tiny subset of the goods listed in the registration.
Well, then, of course the issue is different because --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose the -- and maybe
this is what is worrying some people.  The marks, you
have a mark, I have a mark, and I have -- it's like
Louis Vuitton or something.  I mean, it covers just
thousands of things.  And there is one manufacturer who
makes one of those things, and he really thinks, I don't
have to worry about this, you know.  If -- if I win or
lose, it's not that big a deal.  I don't think they're
going to come into my area really.
MR. JAY:  Louis Vuitton thinks this or
the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, the -- the competitor
in one small thing like a lipstick or something, he
doesn't think there is going to be Louis Vuitton
lipstick, though there may be.  And sure enough, it is
there, and sure enough, he does do it, so he just
doesn't want to go to the time and trouble of having
every possible bit of evidence and so forth.  And then
lo and behold, later on it turns out this is a very big
deal to him.  And what he's worried about is that that
means I have to look at every trademark application, I
have to give my all the first time, and if I don't, I'm
stuck.  That's true, isn't it?
MR. JAY:  Well, it is true that whichever
forum he goes to first, whether it's the trademark board
or a court considering infringement, yes, he's supposed
to give his all the first time because the judgment can
be preclusive in future litigation.
But -- and I think that the reasons to pay
attention to registration in the circumstances that you
gave are significant ones, because if he just lets Louis
Vuitton sit there in the market with a registration for
5 years, and Louis Vuitton's mark becomes incontestable
then he has to face the consequences of that.
So I think that people who are already in
the -- in the market and see a junior mark holder coming
in and seeking registration, they have reasons to oppose
that registration.  But if they don't want to go to the
board, they don't have to go to the board.  No one ever
has to go to the board who doesn't want to, because you
always have the option of pursuing the cancellation
relief or getting a mark cancelled or getting your mark
registered.  You can do that in district court coupled
with an infringement action.
So if you are the senior mark holder, sue
for infringement and you'll have a jury trial, right.
If you win, then you can get the opposing mark
cancelled, provided that it hasn't become uncontestable.
That, I think, is a large part of our answer
to the other side's argument about the jury trial right,
that there's always the option to sue.  There's also
always the option to get Article III review of a
judgment of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.  The
board is just deciding a question of public right.  It's
not trenching on the -- the role of Article III judges.
But once its renders such a judgment, as a matter of
preclusion law, as a matter of statutory text, its
judgment is preclusive because it's deciding the same
issue and under this Court's decision in Astoria v.
Solimino.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you happen to know what
proportion of people in the situation that Justice
Breyer indicated do go to the board?  And is the board
the -- the primary avenue or is it not?
MR. JAY:  That's a difficult question,
Justice Kagan.  I know that there are more board
proceedings filed each year, opposition and cancellation
proceedings filed, than there are infringement actions,
you know, trademark actions, filed in the district
courts.  I know, however, that a lot of those don't go
to final judgment, precisely because I think often the
mere filing of an action in the -- in the board can
alert the -- perhaps the junior mark holder that you're
junior to someone else, you're going to have a problem
if you don't either, A, reach an accommodation; B, limit
yourself geographically; C, choose a different mark.
And I think that the board's proceedings may well be
more conducive to that than litigation.  But in the --
there are, I think, fewer than 200 board cases that go
to final judgment each year in contested proceedings.
I'm not sure how many trademark cases actually go to
final judgment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When you say "to final
judgment," you mean final judgment before the board or
file judgment after review in the courts?
MR. JAY:  I mean final judgment before the
board, Justice Kennedy.  The number of litigants that
actually go on and seek review, as you would expect, is
smaller.  But there's certainly always the option to
seek review, either before the Federal circuit under the
APA standard of review or in district court.  And if you
go to district court, you can, if you choose, introduce
new evidence.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You have alternatively
argued in your brief for some form of deference if we're
not going to call it preclusive.  It seemed to me that
that was addressing an issue you didn't seek cert on,
which was whether the court below erred in not
permitting the mark holder to -- to tell the jury that
the board had found a similarity and confusion.  But I
don't know that you've actually made that argument,
number one.  And number two, on what would you base a
holding of deference?  In what field of law do we say,
give deference and how -- what -- what's the standard
that we would use?
MR. JAY:  The -- first, Justice Sotomayor,
let me be clear.  Our primary position is, of course,
preclusion.  And the only reason that we would get into
deference is if preclusion doesn't apply because, even
though it's the same issue, for some reason the
Trademark Board can't render a preclusive judgment, and
we think that that issue is what's not properly been
preserved because the other side waived it at the cert
stage.
But if you got into that, we think that what
you would look -- and this is why we put question 2 in
our cert petition and the Court granted both questions,
what you would look to, I think -- or, for example, the
arbitration cases like Alexander v. Gardner-Denver, in
which this Court decided that an arbitration in a
Title VII action would not be -- arbitration would not
be preclusive of a Title VII action.  But the fact that
the same parties had litigated the same discrimination
issue before an arbitrator with, perhaps, the same
evidence was entitled to evidentiary weight and perhaps
if every -- if the proceedings were full and fair and
the issues really were the same, perhaps, great weight,
I think, is the final footnote in Gardner-Denver and
then in McDonald v. City of West Branch.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Were those in days before
you could get a jury trial in a Title VII case?
MR. JAY:  The Court, I believe, had not held
that at that point, Justice Ginsburg.  So I think
that's -- I think that's correct.  But I don't think
that the jury question has any effect on this because,
you know, for example, there's -- there's a jury right
in a 1983 case, there's a jury right in an ADEA case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What disturbed the Eighth
Circuit on that point was that the jury would be
powerfully confused; it has enough to deal with what the
charge in the infringement case is.
MR. JAY:  It -- it certainly would require
an explanation of what went on, but I think that that
would have been better than instructing the jury, as was
done here, that the two proceedings involved completely
different issues and that the jury should not give it
any weight at all.
If I may at this point, I'd like to reserve
the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Bash.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. BASH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Respondent has not identified any material
difference between the issue decided by the board and
the issue -- and what was at issue in the infringement
case.  For that reason --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Bash, that's a very much
stronger statement than your briefs make.  So your
briefs go likely and probably and this and that.  And --
so are all of your likely's and probably's no longer
true?
MR. BASH:  Well, the likely's or probably's
were an opening for Respondent to identify a material
difference between the suit and the board proceeding.
The reason we did that is because we were framing the
standard in a slightly different way than it was
proposed below.  And we think if the normal course of
proceedings had happened, Petitioner would have asked
for summary judgment and then Respondent should have
come forward and identified some difference in the goods
or marks or channels of trade, and then the district
court and potentially the jury could have considered
whether that difference was material.
The issues weren't teed up like that in
the courts below, so we wanted to give Respondent a fair
opportunity to identify a difference between what
happened in the board and what happened before
the court, and Respondent has not identified any
difference that we would consider material under our
standard.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  That's an
even -- that's another fudge word, "material."  They
have represented one, which was the use of the mark with
the word "fastener" or whatever it was that the -- that
the Solicitor General's Office referred to earlier, that
Mr. Jay referred to earlier.  So get to the stuff you
think is immaterial.
MR. BASH:  So the only difference that
Respondent has identified is what we would characterize
as a different mark, "Sealtite Building Fasteners"
versus "Sealtite."  Now, I think Petitioner has
demonstrated that "Sealtite Building Fasteners" wasn't
even really at issue in the trial, but even putting
aside that factual distinction, the ordinary rule is
just adding a generic term like "building fasteners"
can't make the difference in a preclusion analysis.  So
I think the way it should have worked had everything
gone sort of the correct way is that Petitioner would
have said, hey, the board proceeding gets issue
preclusion in this infringement suit.  I'm suing about
the word "Sealtite," which is, by the way, what the jury
was instructed, not "Sealtite Building Fasteners."
Respondent then could have come forward and said, well,
actually, the mark's a little different now.  It's
"Sealtite Building Fasteners" or "Sealtite Screws" or
"Sealtite Nails."
And at the summary judgment stage, the
district court would have had to make a judgment about
whether that was a sufficiently different mark to
obviate issue preclusion.  And the material standard is
not just drawn from thin air.  It's the ordinary
standard in issue preclusion where the question arises
whether the second tribunal is considering a
fundamentally different issue than the first tribunal.
I think in Montana v. United States, when this Court
talked about the changed circumstances principle, it
averted to that principle.
And it really has to be that way.  I mean,
just imagine the court-to-court scenario, infringement
court at time one and then infringement court at time
two.  Surely, if Petitioner had obtained a judgment that
the mark "Sealtite" infringes in an infringement court,
Respondent couldn't then just add "Fasteners" and start
the suit all over again and then once Respondent --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, how do you respond
to the question I asked Mr. Jay, that is, as the
Restatement of Judgments says, if one aspect of the
first proceeding is to assure expeditiousness, then
confining the stakes to that issue of registration makes
sense so that the parties will not be induced to dispute
the administrative proceeding in anticipation of its
effect on another proceeding.
MR. BASH:  Justice Ginsburg, I think that's
a correct statement of the law, but it's inapplicable
here.  I think it has two components.  One is how
expedited are the proceedings here?  How close is it to
small court?  The other is what's at stake?  So let me
just take both of those in turn.
This is not like small claims court or
arbitral court.  This is a proceeding in which you have
the full discovery permitted by the civil rules, in fact
with respect to interrogatories, three times as many
interrogatories as in the civil rules, the full Federal
Rules of Evidence, including E-discovery.  It's just
like a civil -- a civil proceeding.  And, in fact, then
you can --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There are some
differences.  There's no live testimony, right.
MR. BASH:  There is -- there's no live
testimony, but I don't think that has ever been
understood as the sort of difference between an
administrative tribunal and a judicial proceeding that
could effectively mean that there wasn't a full and fair
opportunity to litigate the question.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  One of the amicus briefs
suggests that this is very, very much less expensive, so
that it's like 10 percent of the cost of an infringement
suit.  Why is that?
MR. BASH:  Because in an infringement suit,
the most discovery-intensive aspects, I think, are often
damages and injunctive relief.  In other words, you
really have to look at the other side's books to know
how many of these products did you sell, what were your
profits, and so forth.  So it's not surprising that in a
suit where damages or injunctive relief is at issue, it
could be, you know, four times the cost for discovery
purposes of this kind of suit.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I find it hard to
believe that this board proceeding is -- is intended
to -- to be expeditious, because the losing party can go
up to the district court and start all over again de
novo.
MR. BASH:  Thank you, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How is that expeditious?  I
don't understand that.
MR. BASH:  I was going to follow on to my
answer to Justice Ginsburg by making that point.  I
mean, you have a full de novo trial in district court if
you want it, and that doesn't reflect the sort of
proceeding that Congress would have thought was summary
in nature.  And I would just add one, I guess,
higher-level point about the nature of the proceedings,
which is that I think that can come into this case in
two ways.  One, you could think that Congress would not
have intended these proceedings to get preclusive effect
because of their summary nature and I think that's how
Respondent is using it.  But that -- that doesn't work,
because Congress did not set the procedures for the
board.  Section 1123 gives the director authority to set
the procedures.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's -- that's what I
think you'll hear in a minute, because in the brief, the
red brief, on pages 30 to 31 and 8 and 9, there is
discussion about the evidentiary procedures before the
board.  And the -- the Respondent says they are much
more limited.  One, you cannot call live witnesses; two,
the board continuously says that they should not be like
a district court.  They should be far more limited.  So
I guess the argument is, well, in light of that
procedural difference, he can't call all his witnesses,
he can't test the consumer experts of the other side who
say that there is no confusion, and he can't present his
very credible expert who will come up and say, I
interviewed 4,000 consumers and they are totally mixed
up.
So -- so if you have that -- would you
address that?
MR. BASH:  I will address that.  The only
significant difference is no live testimony in front of
the adjudicator.  There is written depositions where the
experts testify, they submit reports, and they can be
cross-examined.  So the only significant difference is
no live testimony in front of the adjudicator.  And as
you know, that is a principle embodied in the APA as
consistent with ordinary administrative action.  The
adjudicator in an administrative tribunal does not need
to hear the witness.  That's embodied in the APA
provision cited in the reply brief.
The -- the other different -- purported
differences that Respondent in one of the amicus briefs
have identified are not actual differences.  They're
quoting snippets of TTAB decisions where the board was
perturbed that the parties engaged in excessive
discovery and they said something like, Look, given the
narrowest of what we're -- narrowness of what we're
deciding -- in one of the cases it was descriptiveness
-- you don't need to engage in full-blown discovery.
The rules and numerous TTAB decisions make very clear
that full-lead discovery is allowed.
The only other, I think, difference or
purported difference identified in one of the amicus
briefs was consumer surveys and the idea that they will
only accept a consumer survey where it has the word on a
blank card.  That's true -- you know, just the word
"Sealtite" on a blank placard.  That's true when what is
sought to be registered is a word mark, not a design
mark with a particular color.  The idea being that you
can't skew the survey by adding colors and things when
actually what you're seeking registration for is just
the word.
But the same thing could happen in an
infringement court.  If the defendant was sued based on
their registered word mark, I think a factfinder in an
infringement court would say a survey that has design
elements -- color, font, and so forth -- when you're
asserting the right to use this word in any context,
that sort of survey is not going to be as probative as a
survey that just uses the word, since you're seeking the
right to just use the word.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Bash, could you go back,
I think it was to Justice Alito's question before, and
just talk a little bit about, do you think that this is
an unusual case in that the issues are the same or a
usual case?
MR. BASH:  I don't have statistics, so I'm
sort of speaking just from my experience reading
the case law.  But I don't think it's terribly unusual.
I mean, I think a lot of times people seek to register a
mark for the goods they sell and so an infringement suit
is going to involve the same goods in the channels of
trade those goods are ordinarily sold in.  So I don't
think it's a situation where issue preclusion is not
worth the candle, and in fact, I think it's
extraordinary administrable, in fact, more administrable
than the average just litigation context, because the
limitations in the first action, in other words, what
goods were at issue, what marks are at issue, what the
channels of trade are, are often just set forth right
there in the registration.  So it's not like you have to
conduct a searching inquiry to figure out what was at
issue in the first administrative proceeding.  You look
at the registration.  If no common law rights are at
issue on the opposition side, you look at the opposer's
registration, and you say, okay, this was about cars
sold to retail consumers; that's what was at issue in
the board proceeding.  If now we're talking about cars
sold to government or municipal entities, that is
potentially a materially different issue.  And then you
have to make the sort of materiality judgment that
courts make every day.
But I guess I just want to close with I
think Respondents' primary textual argument that what is
being considered here are different issues is that the
registration provision uses the word -- the phrase, "so
resembles" and the infringement provision 1114 uses the
phrase "used in commerce."  I mean, as you can just see
from the text of the provisions, they both are about the
marks being used in commerce and whether the marks used
in commerce would confuse people.
If I could just finish one sentence.  The --
and in the infringement provision, the phrase "colorable
imitation" is defined, as the reply brief points out, as
"so resembles."  So the textual provisions are precisely
parallel.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Katyal.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Congress designed the Trademark Registry as
a relatively low-cost signaling mechanism to provide
notice, but Congress made clear that the main event, the
conclusive determination of the right to use a mark in
commerce, was reserved for Article III courts with
robust procedures and sweeping remedies.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you do have that
alternative before -- after a board action.
MR. KATYAL:  We certainly do with respect to
district court review.  It's de novo, and that's one
reason, Justice Sotomayor, why we think when we're
analyzing whether Congress intended to adopt a
preclusion doctrine we think the answer to that is no.
That is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's my problem,
which is, it seems to me, that you are rendering the
board proceeding almost irrelevant with respect to
litigation.  And it may be when you're seeking de novo
review, but why should we say that you get a second bite
at the apple after you've wasted the board's time?  Why
not just tell you go straight -- if you're going to wait
for an infringement action, go there.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that Congress did
intend that the district court -- the TTAB proceeding
was rendered largely irrelevant when there was district
court de novo review.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except that in Kappos,
we explicitly said that some weight should be given to
the board's judgment.  So it's not as if it's being
ignored altogether, right?
MR. KATYAL:  Precisely.  But when there's
new evidence, as there was in Kappos, then it is de novo
review.  And this Court in Astoria said when that
occurs, that when you have a system like that, that's
Congress telegraphing that they didn't intend for
preclusive review to exist.  That is to say, why would
Congress have said that the TTAB decisions over
registration, something that they have absolute 100
percent --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's not what
happened here.  The court below said, no, you can't give
a jury -- you can't describe to this jury what the
trademark board did.  You can't decide whether it was
the same evidence and how much weight to give.  That's
not the path that was followed here.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, I disagree, Your Honor.
In this case, the jury was told about the -- about the
TTAB determination at several points in the record.
Now, it's true that the district court ultimately said,
look, at the end of the day these are different
questions.  This is what Joint Appendix page 247 says,
that the district court said, after review of all of
this, it was different evidence answering a different
question and fundamentally the different question that
is at issue in TTAB or district court de nova review is
this.  It is -- you know, when -- they do say the same
concept, likelihood of confusion, but the subject is
very different.  That is, in a registration decision the
question about what is likely to confuse is a
resemblance where -- a confusing resemblance.  Whereas
the question under the statute with respect to
infringement is a confusing use.
Now, that distinction has
persisted for 150 years, since the year 1870, and I
think you could endorse the type of statutory gymnastics
that my friend from the government does to say, hey,
these are the same inquiry.  But at the end of the day,
that is against everything this Court's precedents
teach, which is that when Congress uses different
statutory formulations in different provisions, they are
deemed to mean different things.  And here, you know, my
friend from the government concluded by saying, well,
you know the statute defines confusing resemblance --
excuse me, defines -- defines colorable imitation as a
resemblance and so, therefore, the inquiries are somehow
the same.  Absolutely not.  Because what the trademark
infringement statute says, 1114, is not simply that you
need to have a colorable imitation, it's that you need
to have a colorable imitation that in its use causes a
likelihood of confusion.  A colorable imitation alone is
not enough.  You've got to have both the colorable
imitation or resemblance, plus the use of it.  That's
what causes the infringement and that's the heart of the
infringement inquiry --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But, but, but, but.  The
board has to decide whether the trademark as applied to
particular goods is confusing.  Once you say it's as
applied to particular goods in a particular area of
commerce, isn't that the same as saying has used whether
it causes confusion?
MR. KATYAL:  Not at all, Justice Scalia.
And you have all of the amici, all the trademark
practitioners before you on behalf of neither party or
on behalf of us telling you that is not what the statute
means or how it's applied.  Why?  Because, yes, it
mentions the word "use" once with respect to in
connection of the goods, but that's only to connect the
fact -- the mark to the fact that it is being applied to
certain goods.  Every amici is telling you that the way
in which the TTAB interprets that statute is to say that
the ultimate focus is on the confusing resemblance.
This case is a perfect illustration of that.
The TTAB here said, look, we're going to look to whether
or not these are the same things.  Basically, are these
bolts or not and not to how in practice it's actually
used.  And that is why --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But even in use what causes
the confusion will be the resemblance.  I don't care if
you just add on -- tack on "as used."  The problem is
the resemblance between the two marks in every -- in
every situation it seems to me.
MR. KATYAL:  Justice Scalia, here's our key
point.  It's not simply the resemblance.  It's how the
products are used in practice.  It's how they're
marketed, how they're sold, to whom they're sold.  In
this case, for example, Justice --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was that presented to
the board in this case?
MR. KATYAL:  Excuse me?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was it presented to the
board?
MR. KATYAL:  What's the "it"?  I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That answer.  How you
use the mark, the market.  I thought the board did.
MR. KATYAL:  We tried to put some of that
evidence in, Your Honor, but as -- as the amici are
saying and, indeed, as the decision in this case
reveals, ultimately, the way the TTAB decides -- it
doesn't really weigh actual use very much at the end of
the day.  That is, you can have all the inputs of actual
use that you want into the TTAB process, but the
question the TTAB is answering guided --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You didn't answer my
question.  Was all of that -- was the same evidence --
MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely not.  And so for --
let me just -- let me respond to what -- to the question
that you were asking my friend before, was the evidence
the same.  Absolutely not.
So in the -- in the TTAB proceedings there
were a whopping four depositions introduced and zero
discovery, zero discovery.  In the trial, 14 live
witnesses over a seven-day trial with 4,000 pages of
discovery, this mirrors, as the amici say, the way that
these proceedings generally unfold and here are some of
the differences.  The jury was told -- the jury trial
had lots of evidence about customer sophistication.
And -- and, indeed, the district court on summarizing
that evidence said -- and this is at Joint Appendix --
this is Petition Appendix page 37 -- that that evidence
was overwhelming.  That this was not kind of people
going to Ace Hardware, the customers like that.  This is
a very sophisticated set of customers who knew exactly
the difference between the types of bolts.  Now,
the TTAB --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And this evidence could not
have been introduced before the board.
MR. KATYAL:  We -- we tried --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  To be sure it was not
introduced, but could it have been introduced before the
board?
MR. KATYAL:  It could only to introduced to
limit the mark and that's what the amici say.  That is
-- and this is a technical part of trademark law, but
here's how it works.  Basically, when the TTAB is
examining evidence of actual use, they can use it to
determine whether or not -- what the mark means.  So you
can introduce evidence about what is a building
fastener, but you can't introduce that evidence to
somehow limit the meaning of the mark.  So the mark here
is simply the word "Sealtite," that's what Joint
Appendix page 70 says.
You couldn't in TTAB point to all the amici
who are before you saying that the TTAB couldn't take
actual use evidence and say, well, it's only sold to
this type of consumer or that type of consumer.  That
wouldn't be something that they could do.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Could you do this -- I
don't know if you have time -- but with an example.  The
reason I'm having a hard time, I'm thinking Louis
Vuitton, say, all right.  Now Lilly Vuitton wants to
register a mark.  Okay.  So we go to the TTAB and it's
for lipstick.  And Lilly says, look it, it says Lilly
Vuitton and Louis says, yeah.  And now the question is
well, will it cause confusion when used in connection
with the lipstick?
MR. KATYAL:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So we look at it.  All
right.  Now we're in the infringement action.  Exact
same situation.  And here they are supposed to say, will
it cause confusion when you -- when -- will it cause
confusion in connection with the sale of any goods or
services which includes the lipstick?  So I'm having a
terrible time seeing what the difference is.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, Justice Breyer, the
difference is exactly what you just said there with --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It may be what I said, but
I just didn't see it.
MR. KATYAL:  The statute -- in the
infringement statute, 1114, mentions use repeatedly,
including advertising, sales, all different ways in
which use causes confusion.  And the ultimate question
that's being asked is:  Does that use, does such use
cause confusion?
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  And it says the same
thing here.  It says does it so resemble a mark as to
cause confusion when used in connection with the goods?
MR. KATYAL:  Exactly, Justice Breyer.  But
there it is the mark's resemblance that
causes confusion.  And to be sure, you can look to the
fact that it's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's the resemblance in
connection with the goods.
MR. KATYAL:  With the fact that it's goods,
but not how the goods are used, the advertising, the
marketing, the sales.  That's the difference.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Not how they're used.
Okay.  So what about saying this then.  We'd say, if it
turns out that in your infringement case that was really
an issue, you know, that was really a big deal in
this -- a serious deal in this case, it's not because of
the use of the goods, it's because of the resemblance
through advertising cures it.  Then you don't have --
not -- not precluded.  You are only precluded in the
case the SG says, which is where everything is really
the same.
MR. KATYAL:  We have two answers to that.
The first is as Justice Ginsburg was saying earlier when
the weight of the proceedings has differences at stake,
then preclusion shouldn't apply.  But the second, just
to deal with that, is that if the mark itself claims
some sort of limited sale, limited -- limited category
of people to whom it's being sold to in the channels of
trade and the like, then that actual use evidence can
come in.
The red brief at page 47 gives you a bunch
of cases from the TTAB, as well as the Federal Circuit,
cases like Octocom, cases like Mayer Berkshire, in which
the -- in which the TTAB is told it's actually error to
introduce evidence of actual use.  Now, why is it error?
Because if you have a general mark, like the mark
Sealtite, it's not being limited in any way to
particular channels of trade or particular ways in which
it's sold.  If it is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would the -- would the
same rule apply in a de novo review of the board's
actions in a Federal district court?
MR. KATYAL:  We do think that it would
apply.  And I don't take my friend on the other side to
be arguing the reverse.  Yes, you could have live
testimony that -- that aspect falls out.  But still, the
overall statutory inquiry is about whether the mark has
a confusing resemblance.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I was going to ask you
in your answer to Justice Scalia in which you've talked
about the narrowness of the issues, you would make the
same comments and -- and give us the same instruction
regarding what issues and what evidence is presented in
the district court on de novo review?
MR. KATYAL:  That is why -- that our view is
that even if evidence is introduced at the district
court de novo stage, that still doesn't cure the
fundamental problem.  Preclusion shouldn't apply both
because the question being asked is different as well as
the procedures by which they're adjudicated.  For
example, no jury trial in the -- in the de novo review
proceeding means that the full panoply of kind of rights
that inhere when this Court -- when Article III courts
are asked to decide a longstanding common law tradition
such as the right of infringement.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the -- the
issues are not always different.  Justice Breyer's
lipstick example, I mean, that's sold in a retail
market.  So the question is not -- there isn't going to
be a different use from what the TTAB is looking at and
what you want to be able to look at de novo.  But I
gather in your case, you say these building fasteners,
people don't go buy them like they buy lipstick, it's
only more sophisticated general contractors.
So why isn't that enough of an answer to say
that as a general matter, the TTAB provisions are
preclusive, but if you are showing a different -- a
difference in use or a more specialized use or something
other than what the TTAB would have been looking at,
preclusion doesn't apply.  Which I gather is -- is the
way preclusion normally works.
MR. KATYAL:  I'd say two things.  Number one
is I don't think that argument is available to the
Petitioner since they hadn't advanced that particular
argument.  And if they did, I think it would run
headlong into the district court's conclusion at page
28A that the evidence here was so different, even giving
all sorts of deference --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm more
concerned if the argument is available to you.  I mean,
in other words, you're the one that is asking for the
absence of preclusion.  And it seems to me that you
could prevail on the idea that when the -- when the uses
are actually different it's not precluded, but when
they -- they are not -- when they are the same, it is.
That's the basic preclusion rule.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that ultimately,
though, the basic preclusion rule is caveated in two
different ways.  One is the inquiry actually has to be
the same, it has to be an identical inquiry; and the
second is that the procedures and the incentives at
stake, as Justice Ginsburg was saying, have to be the
same as well.
We think the answer to that -- to both of
those is no.  That is, even when the registration
analysis is looking at evidence of actual use, it is
looking to it for a different purpose.  It's ultimately
asking is the resemblance confusing, not is the actual
use confusing.
Now, imagine you could have some theoretical
world, some hypothetical in which the TTAB is deciding
the exact same actual use question as in the
infringement action.  The INTA brief at page 20, filed
by the trademark practitioners on behalf of neither
party, says that theoretical world never happens in
reality.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, would you give me an
example of -- of a situation in which the use is
confusing but the resemblance is not?
MR. KATYAL:  Sure.  So the -- the confusing
use is -- so suppose that the Trademark Office allows
the regs straying of the word "Sike," S-I-K-E, to put on
shoes.  It's a general standard logo.  It doesn't have
any particular -- you know, it doesn't have any
particular marks or anything like that, no stylization.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  To be put on shoes?
MR. KATYAL:  Yeah, put on shoes, but it's
just S-I-K-E.  That may be not create a likelihood of
confusion in its generic, broad, just character form,
but when it is applied at the infringement stage with
the swoosh of Nike and the like, then you could find a
confusing use.  And by contrast --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I'm asking for an
example where there is a confusing use, but not a
confusing resemblance.
MR. KATYAL:  That is one, Your Honor, in
which the confusing resemblance -- because the confusing
resemblance for registration is decided in a kind of
paper way with usually standard character marks, in
other words, no stylization, no font, no logos --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Before the board, you are
talking about.
MR. KATYAL:  Exactly, before the board.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay, never mind the board.
Doesn't the court that is deciding whether this is an
infringing use, doesn't that court have to decide
whether that use is confusing by reason of the
resemblance?
MR. KATYAL:  Not simply -- that's our whole
point.  And what I was saying to you earlier, it's not
simply the resemblance that causes infringement.  It is
the use as well.  So if the mark itself is being used in
a generic way, that doesn't -- that isn't itself a
confusing --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it says right here,
"so resembles a mark as to be likely to cause confusion
when used on or in connection with the goods of the
applicant."
MR. KATYAL:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So why doesn't Nike say,
look at the Sike mark, look at how it's used.  As it's
used and we use ours with a swish, of course it causes
confusion.  Wouldn't they be free to tell the board
that?
MR. KATYAL:  Justice Breyer, the answer to
that is no.  That is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  They can't?
MR. KATYAL:  That is, in the board
proceeding, they can look to evidence of stylization,
the packaging, the way in which it's actually used.
They can look to the good, the fact that it is a shoe,
but they can't go further than that.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah.
MR. KATYAL:  And that's the answer, that's
why all of those cases, Octocom, Mayer/Berkshire, the
New York Football Giants case, all -- as well as all the
amici, are saying that's not the way the board works in
practice, and it's guided by the language of the
statute --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Your example --
MR. KATYAL:  -- because the language of the
statute refers to use being confusing three times with
respect to infringement --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess -- I guess I'm just
not understanding what you are saying.  I'm sure it's
me.  But if you put this mark on the sneaker and then
you say, well, is it confusing as it appears on the
sneaker, isn't that exactly what the TTAB is asking?
MR. KATYAL:  No --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Look, here is this mark.
Here is this good.  Here is this mark on this good.  Is
that confusing?
MR. KATYAL:  Justice Kagan, the mark that is
being put on the good in the registration inquiry is the
mark that is being claimed.  "Mark" is a specific term
of art.  It's defined in Section 1127 of the statute to
mean the actual word in the application; here it would
be "Sealtite," in my example it would be "Sike."  It's
not how the mark is used --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So just to make sure
I understand, you are saying the mark is just S-I-K-E
without the swoosh.
MR. KATYAL:  Exactly, and indeed the PTO
encourages all registrations to have that kind of
generic mark in order to facilitate this kind of
low-cost registration notice system that I was talking
about at the outset.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't the swoosh itself a
mark?
MR. KATYAL:  The swoosh itself may be a
mark --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So you have introduced
another mark.  I don't see how your example works.
MR. KATYAL:  Well then, to use the actual
word in -- "Sike" in the way that Nike uses it, you
know, with the same kind of stylization, color, logo,
all that kind of stuff.  That is, it's often the case
that registration confusing resemblance is a broader
category of circumstances than confusing use.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I understand you --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is the answer?  Would
that be confusing?
MR. KATYAL:  It certainly could be a --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I need to know the
answer --
MR. KATYAL:  It certainly could be a
confusing use, yes, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Katyal --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- the -- the district
court would hear no additional evidence that the board
would not have heard other than the difference between
oral and written?
MR. KATYAL:  No.  The district court in an
infringement action would --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.
MR. KATYAL:  -- on de novo review.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On de novo review.
MR. KATYAL:  Right.  In the district court's
de novo review proceeding -- and this is what the amici
are saying -- it focuses on really the abstract
question, unless -- there is one exception to that.  The
exception is if the mark that is being sought -- and
this is what I was saying to Justice Kagan -- does limit
itself in some way.  So if Sike sought to register a
mark that actually had the colors and the particular
distinctive font of -- that Nike uses, then of course
that evidence about actual use could come in.  But when
you're having, as a circumstance like this --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm sorry.  You
keep saying we tried to put it in.  Did you put it in?
MR. KATYAL:  We --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The board did recite
that they were used in a different market, and a lot of
things that suggest they had all the information that
you ultimately put in on trial -- at trial.
MR. KATYAL:  Justice Sotomayor, there is no
question I think in my mind in this case that they
didn't have the same evidence.  If you look to, for
example, the confused customer sophistication --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  By the way, is there a
record?  I should have looked for it earlier.  Is the
trademark record before us in the joint appendix?
MR. KATYAL:  I'm not sure if the trademark
record is.  The trademark opinion ultimately is.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.  No, no, no.  The
record that was submitted to the trademark court.
MR. KATYAL:  I'm not sure if the full record
is before you.  We can obviously try and get that to you
if you'd like.
But let me suggest to you that if you
looked, for example, at customer sophistication, the
district court says the evidence on this is overwhelming
that this is a sophisticated group of consumers as to
which -- after -- based on lots of live testimony, lots
of different witnesses, whereas the Trademark Board said
the reverse.  They said, ah, it's hard to tell which way
this cuts; there is very limited evidence one way or the
other.
Same thing with the words "Sealtite Building
Fastener," which the district court at page 35a said
there was evidence at trial that Sealtite, Hargis,
always used the entire phrase as one thing, "Sealtite
Building Fasteners."  Why is that important?  Because if
you are using "Building Fasteners" in connection with
"Sealtite," you are not going to confuse people who are
buying screws for the aerospace industry or something
like that.  It's limited to building fasteners.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Katyal, if we want to
check up on what you are saying about these limitations,
where would we look?  Where does the board say we don't
look at use in the way that you're saying they don't
look at use?
MR. KATYAL:  Let me read to you from the
Octocom decision.  This is -- this is from -- this is at
page 47 of our brief:  "It was not error for the board
to give no weight to evidence that Octocom modems are
bought by a particular class of purchases.  It would
have been error to do otherwise.  Because the party
seeks an unrestricted registration, such evidence of a
specific class of customers didn't relate to a material
fact" --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, I'm doing this
quickly and on the fly, but isn't that the key phrase,
"unrestricted application"?
MR. KATYAL:  Exactly.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  They sought an unrestricted
application.
MR. KATYAL:  Exactly.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And here there is not an
unrestricted application.
MR. KATYAL:  No, there is, Justice Kagan.
The application is at page 70.  It is only for the word
"Sealtite."  It is not to a specific class of
purchasers, such as the sophisticated group of consumers
that the district court found so crucial in finding no
infringement.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I didn't --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that your one case or do
you have others?
MR. KATYAL:  Sure.  Mayer/Berkshire says the
same thing.  This is at 424 F.3d at 1232:  "A claim of
infringement before the court and likelihood of
confusion before this board are different claims.  In
board proceedings, likelihood of confusion is determined
independent of the context of actual usage.  In an
infringement action, on the other hand, the context of
the use of the mark is relevant."
It could not be clearer, Justice Kagan.
That's the way this is done in practice.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Katyal, Justice
Scalia suggested that these are not expeditious
proceedings before the whatever it is, TTAB.  And
what -- what is the situation there?  I know it's a lot
less expensive to go to the board than it is to go to a
court, but how rapidly are these processed?
MR. KATYAL:  I think the amici are before
you, all of the amici saying that it is a much quicker
process that tracks Congress's intent, which was a
low-cost system that was going to provide notice.  And
if you adopt my friend's argument on the other side, as
all the amici are saying to you, you do incentivize the
Hargises of the world to come forth and in the
registration -- they may not seek registration at all
because the cost of doing so, as was suggested in the
first part of the argument, is now going to be so high,
you are stuck for all time -- this is, Justice Breyer,
your earlier Louis Vuitton example -- you are stuck for
all time with -- because you happened to litigate
registration in the TTAB, now be -- now it is preclusive
in an infringement action down the road.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought you said that the
preclusion analysis would be the same if there were de
novo review in the district court.  So if that's the
case, then, how can you rely on the nature of the TTAB
proceeding alone?
MR. KATYAL:  Well, if the nature --
because even in the district court, the process isn't
the same as an infringement in two different respects.
One is, of course, there is no right to a jury trial and
we do think that there are some constitutional doubts
that are engendered by my friend's reading on the other
side.  And second, the question that is being asked in
de novo review is ultimately a different one.  It's
about whether or not the use is confusing, not whether
the resemblance is.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I see all those
points, but do you claim that the district court
proceeding is -- is expeditious and for that reason
there would be no preclusion?
MR. KATYAL:  No.  We're not saying that
the -- at least the district court process does have the
robust Article III and jury protections available to it.
If the jury decides, first, a finding of infringement,
we do think, as our brief points out, that a separate
statute, 1051, would make that pre -- not preclusive,
but would simply bar -- bar the registration of that
mark.
And I think that's an important point
because Congress here did something, and this is what
our red brief at page 30 says, with respect to
registration decisions, they actually thought through
how is registration going to matter at the infringement
stage?  And they said, look, it's going to give you
certain things.  It's going to give you presumptions of
validity, presumptions of ownership and the like, but
nowhere did they do what, for example, they've done in
the patent statute in 35 U.S.C. 315 and 325 and
affirmatively buy into the preclusion doctrine and
say --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Quick question.  If you are
right about the difference between resembling causing
confusion and using in connection causing confusion,
then if you go to the review procedure and you go into
the full district court, that doesn't preclude either.
MR. KATYAL:  Exactly.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So there's no preclusion
whether you go to the district court or not in your
basic statutory view there.
MR. KATYAL:  That is correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it seems to me that,
and I'll check what the experts in this area say in the
amicus briefs, but it seems to me that the fact that
this is a simpler proceeding and that a person concerned
about cost would want the simpler proceeding and would
want the preclusion.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, Your Honor, sometimes
they may want that once they've already made the
decision to register, so our point is twofold.  First,
people like Hargis may not seek registration in the
first place.  And second, as the amici are saying, if
they do seek registration, then they have to do, Justice
Kennedy, exactly what you're saying, which is litigate
to the hilt and turn that district court de novo review
proceeding into an infringement trial.  And that's
antithetical to what Congress wanted.  Congress wanted a
low-cost system to incentivize people to come in because
it generates positive externalities.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure that I buy
that, because to the extent that someone's not going to
settle and go away or get a sublicense, why should we be
now inviting, instead of a district court proceeding,
inviting an infringement action?  I mean, that will --
that's going to be more lengthy no matter what because
then damages and a lot of other things are involved.
MR. KATYAL:  Because, Justice Sotomayor, the
registration decision at the end only decides a very
limited thing.  It doesn't decide the right to use the
good.  That's something only infringement does.  That's
why -- that's kind of -- it's kind of the main banana is
infringement.  Congress has known that.  That's the way
it's been for hundreds of years.  There isn't going to
be any sidestepping of an infringement inquiry in an
appropriate case.  It's going to happen.
The question then is:  Do you want a
litigant like Hargis to be stuck with a limited record
with limited evidence on a limited question,
particularly when, as I was saying to Justice Scalia,
the registration question that's being determined either
in the district court or in the TTAB is generally a
broader one.  It's about the paper mark.  And there's
easier to find likelihood of confusion based on that
paper mark than you can in actuality.
And so someone like Hargis in which you've
had a jury trial finding, look, no infringement, indeed
they had to -- the evidence was so weak on likely to
confusion that they had to manufacture some of it, those
types of rulings will never be able to happen because of
an administrative process, a stripped down process that
didn't ask the right question at the end of the day,
which is, is the use of the product, looking at the
stylization, looking at the way it's done in practice,
looking at the customer sophistication and the like, is
that use actually causing confusion?
This case is a perfect illustration of why
you wouldn't want to have a preclusion rule in practice
because there's no infringement at bottom line here when
the product's actual use is being decided.  The only way
you can find a likelihood of confusion is by looking to
something more abstract, the resemblance and the
similarity of the goods alone, only the goods, not the
way in which the goods are actually being manufactured
and being sold.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Katyal, I'm just
looking here at the TTAB's analysis and it seems to me
it's loaded with stuff about use.  It says, "B&B's
sophisticated fasteners are primarily used in sealing
applications while Hargis's products are the next step
up from a nail and are not made for sealing."
MR. KATYAL:  Justice Kagan, there's no doubt
that they recite that as part of the facts, but at page
70, they say the determinative factor here is the
similarity of the goods and not the similarity of the
goods in the actual marketplace because as the district
court found, these goods actually don't compete in the
marketplace whatsoever.
Sure, some evidence is going to come in at
the front end.  Our point, Justice Kagan, is at the back
end, the process that is the question the TTAB is
deciding ultimately is about confusing resemblance and
that is a lot easier --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Again, it says, "The
products of the parties move in different channels of
trade."  It says, "It's the use of substantially
identical marks on closely-related products."
MR. KATYAL:  Well, Justice Kagan, our point
is not -- our brief acknowledges that, that oftentimes
the TTAB, some evidence of actual use comes in, but it
comes in to answer a different question.
It's kind of like Montana v. Egelhoff, the
dual intoxication case.  Some evidence about alcohol can
come in for -- to determine whether or not someone had
the first degree murder intent.  Other evidence on
intoxication might come in in a different trial to
determine whether or not someone had the physical
ability to pull the trigger.  The evidence comes in in
both cases, but it's asking a different question at the
end of the day.  The resemblance inquiry is abstract
and -- and the infringement one is actuality.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Jay, you have three minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JAY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Everything Hargis wanted to put in at the
trademark board it could have put in.  If it had won, it
would have had a valuable protection.  And, Justice
Kennedy, this goes to why litigants would -- would seek
preclusion.  It would have been protected against an
infringement action based on the same facts.  And that
is why we think that the Federal Circuit has been for
years affirming the idea that once you've already won in
one tribunal in an infringement action, the trademark
board shouldn't reach a different decision.  The
trademark board should not be registering marks that
infringe, it should not be withholding registration for
marks that don't.
Let me point -- let me be absolutely clear
about what the trademark board can consider.  I must
respectfully disagree with my friend about -- about what
he said.  If you want to consider the logo, the board
can consider the logo.  Look at the Toro case about the
mark LawnPup which had a -- which was used with a little
dog.  Look at the Federal Circuit's decision in Kenner
which dealt with the mark Play-Doh and which the Federal
Circuit went on and on about the fact that the two
products were used with trade dress that was exactly the
same.  Even though --
JUSTICE BREYER:  This -- remember the case
we had where you can trademark a color.
MR. JAY:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And it was a peculiar shade
of green and used on dry cleaning pads.  Suppose I want
to do that and I own the trademark, a junior person
comes in and he has a different shade of green.  Okay?
Seems different.  Can I introduce evidence that the
people who use these particular kinds of dry cleaners
are colorblind?  And so they won't recognize the
difference.  It has nothing to do with the use.  It has
only to do with the customers or the conditions in which
they are used.  Can I introduce that at the board or
not?
MR. JAY:  Let me -- I think no, but let me
contrast with --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.
MR. JAY:  But the reason why -- what Hargis
could put in, what it needed to put in, this just goes
to the essential difference.  And this is what Justice
Kagan brought out in her colloquy with my friend.  That
there is a restriction in these registrations.  One is
restricted to aerospace fasteners.  One is restricted to
building fasteners.  And the differences between those
marks, that's what the board took evidence on and
considered.  It didn't just make up what the nature of
the fastener market was.  It took evidence on it and
that's why at 61A and 64A of the Petition Appendix it
explains it understands that the fastener market is not
monolithic.  It explains that there is not direct
competition, but it understands that there is likely
confusion because if you are looking for a fastener and
you think that, oh, I'll buy a Sealtite fastener, it
must be made by the aerospace people, that's what --
that's what they were getting at, and that's evidence
that the board could come in.
My friend said repeatedly that the evidence
was different between the proceedings.  Respectfully,
that doesn't matter.  Page 52 of our blue brief, Section
27 of the Restatement of Judgments:  New evidence is not
what matters.  The question is were they asking the same
question.  And the Trademark Board could and did take
evidence about the question whether aerospace fasteners
are so different from construction fasteners that,
despite the phonetic identity of the marks, we should
let Hargis use its mark on these different goods.  And
the board said:  We've looked at the differences, but we
find that they are intrinsically related because they're
both fasteners even if different.
Maybe that was right and maybe that was
wrong.  We, of course, think it was right.  But if
Hargis thought it was wrong its remedy was to appeal,
not to relitigate.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Katyal suggested that --
he read from two cases which suggest some kind of
different standard.
MR. JAY:  The difference, Justice Kagan, is
if both cases recite modems as to good, the board
doesn't look beyond that and say, oh, fancy modems and
cheap modems.  But if you recite different goods in your
two registrations, it absolutely does look at the
differences between those goods and that is why there is
preclusion here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
