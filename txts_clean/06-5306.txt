CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
next in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell.
Mr. Mancino.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL MANCINO, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MANCINO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Petitioner is before this Court because he
followed an order of the district court. He filed his
notice of appeal within the time authorized by the
district court. It was only when the matter came before
the court of appeals was it raised that the district
court apparently had no authority to grant a 17-day
extension, although it specified a specific date rather
than the 14 days in connection with the case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, it was authorized by
the district court in the sense the district court put
it on a piece of paper. It wasn't authorized because
the district court had no authority to extend that.
MR. MANCINO: The district court put it on
there. When you look at the actual entry itself, it's a
handwritten entry. There's no way of telling from the
handwritten entry whether that entry was even entered on
the docket on the same date because all you have is the
handwritten entry, February 10, file your appeal by
February 27, which is unusual in a civil case because
normally in a civil case you get a judgment; you don't
get a directive from the Court that you have 30 days to
file a notice of appeal or anything in connection with
this. So I don't think it's unreasonable to rely upon a
directive from a court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you knew that 14
days was the maximum because the motion asking for it
cited and quoted from the rule.
MR. MANCINO: Well, that -- we did cite from
the rule. That is correct. When the order came out --
well, first of all, we were glad to get the order to
allow time to appeal; but looking at the order, or just
looking at the date, something had to be done. And Of
course, we filed on one day before the end date --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if, what if the
District Court gave you an extra month? Would your
argument still be the same, that that -- because the
court set it, that trumps the limitation in the rule?
MR. MANCINO: Well, then you get into
certain time limits, whether it's reasonable under the
circumstances, would a reasonable attorney or litigant
rely upon a, you know, expansive period of time that the
court gave to it. But here certainly this order is not
unreasonable. It's certainly within the confines. And
you have a specific end date, do your notice of appeal
by this date.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't a reasonable
lawyer have said see, I referred to the rule, when I
made this motion for extension of time. The rule said
days; this judge obviously made a slip. He
miscalculated.
Wouldn't a lawyer faced with what the rule
clearly says and an inconsistency scribbled on an order,
say the judge probably made a mistake? So I better, if
I want to protect my client, do what the rule says?
MR. MANCINO: Well, looking back, that is
probably correct. But looking at the order, and the way
it came out, and the fact that you know, the -- the rule
allowed for a reopening of the appeal, just looking at
the end date of the order, make sure the notice of
appeal is filed by that date, it would seem to me that
the party who is adversely affected by it may object on
that basis, saying Judge, you have no authority to do
this, what are you doing in connection with --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't -- this is
just a notice of appeal. Why would you -- why not file
it the same day? In terms of looking at it from some
equitable sense, I don't understand why you wait toward
the end of the period assuming you hadn't focused on the
difference between the 14 days and the days allowed.
What -- why, why would you delay filing the
notice of appeal?
MR. MANCINO: Well, the only reason for
delaying it is obviously workload. And you don't want
to get all briefs due within a short period of time,
once you get your notice of appeal filed in a particular
case, because you have time limits for getting the
record, your briefing, and you know, there's a number of
appeals going out -- not in this Court, but you know
there were a number of appeals going on.
And my normal practice is you know, file
your notice of appeal near the end of the applicable
appeals time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make -- does
it a difference that we're dealing with the safety valve
provision? In other words, you've got the 30 days to
file; and then this rule allows you to -- it's a safety
valve, if you didn't get the notice or whatever, you've
got a certain procedure that can give you the extra 14
days. And now it seems to me that you're asking for a
safety valve on top of a safety valve.
And I wonder if there's some point where you
cut off the -- allowing an out for missing the deadline.
MR. MANCINO: Well, I suppose at some point,
someone may say well, if the court gave you 180 days to
do the act, someone may say well, that appears to be
unreasonable in connection with that. I think the safer
thing is just to put the order down, say application,
reopen the appeal time, granted.
And then it would cause someone to go you
know, go back, look at the rule, see how much time is
allotted under the rule in connection with the case.
But I don't think it's unreasonable; in these
circumstances we're only talking about three days to do
an act. The act was done in two days.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but as soon as
you start talking about an exception from the provision
in the rules, then you're going to get a lot of
applications and there are going to be a lot of
different reasons for why it wasn't filed on the last
day. Once that -- it seems to me, you open it up for an
indeterminate ruling.
MR. MANCINO: Well, this is an equitable
rule in itself. Because it allows something where an
appeal time has expired, can you come in and show the
circumstances, one, you were not notified, which
obviously the court did. The other side's prejudiced --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well it is an equitable
rule conditioned upon compliance with time limits.
MR. MANCINO: Well, that's -- that's once
it's granted. It's not, the time limit is 180 days or
the seven day after you received or became aware actual
notice --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but
Justice Kennedy's point I think is critical. In other
words, the drafters of the rule obviously wanted to
provide a safety valve. But they also appreciated that
you can't have it open-ended. So they did impose limits
on the -- if you want to call it equitable exception to
the 30-day rule. And it seems to me that you sort of
restrike the balance the drafters of the rule struck if
you allow further equitable departures from their, their
rule.
MR. MANCINO: Well, I think in past cases
the Court has always recognized there are deadlines but
there are exceptions to deadlines. And the most
compelling exemption is where a court says do the act at
this particular time. And you know, it's coming from a
judicial officer, it's not coming from someone
miscalculating on the calendar, calculating the time
when it's 30 days run, when is 14 days run, when it's 10
days run in connection with the case. Because in civil
litigation you are not given any specific time to do an
act. Criminal cases are a little bit different. You
are told about an appeal, when an appeal has to be filed
in connection with a case. You do not have in civil,
when you get your final order -- you know you have 30
days to do it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mancino, your position
here is that this rule is not jurisdictional.
Now, what -- what are the consequences of
that? I take it that that would mean that the court of
appeals has no obligation to inquire on its own whether
the matter has been filed too late?
MR. MANCINO: Well, I believe --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right? If the parties
don't make anything of it, the court of appeals can --
can take a late, a late filing?
MR. MANCINO: Well, I think when the court
of appeals does that, I think in all fairness, they
should advise the parties in advance that they we're
considering this on our own, that the appeal was out of
time, and would you like to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, but I'm asking
whether a court of appeals has to even worry about that?
If the parties don't make anything of it, the court of
appeals can just assume it's okay and go ahead, right?
MR. MANCINO: Correct. Because I think
they've waived any -- the other side obviously has
waived or forfeited any right to object to the -- you
know, to the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you need an objection
or else it's, it will be okay?
MR. MANCINO: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you need an objection
or else it will be all right?
MR. MANCINO: Yes. The objection in this
case came -- you know, in the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That means that a rule --
that -- 14 days is really a rule left to the discretion
of the district judge. If the district judge feels like
giving a little more, this would be no control, unless
the opposing side objects; is that right?
MR. MANCINO: Well, I -- I believe it does
call for a timely objection by somebody to say
something, rather than to just sit back and let it
expire, knowing that someone did something that they
should not do in connection with --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose you have problems
at home. I don't know, you have an illness at home.
And you ask counsel for the other side, you know, I know
it's a 14-day limit, but would you give me 20 days?
Right? And opposing counsel being as friendly as they
are nowadays --
(Some laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the other, the other
side would say sure, take 20 days. Okay? So you
prepare a paper for signature by the judge and he signs
off on it, gives you 20 days. That's okay then, right?
MR. MANCINO: Well I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Because the other side's
agreed. He won't object on the court of appeals. And
suddenly, suddenly, you've got 20 days even though the
rule says 14.
MR. MANCINO: Well, there you have somewhat
advance knowledge that you're doing something possibly
contrary to a rule. But then you have the issue of once
you do it, are you forfeiting your right to object and
claim a deficiency in the process.
Here you're only -- what you're doing --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, that -- that
may, that may be true of this stage; but
Justice Scalia's question points up the problem of what
do we do if we write this case? How do we formulate
this rule? And if we say that it's not jurisdictional,
not binding, then going forward, it seems to me to allow
the hypothetical that he puts to you.
MR. MANCINO: Well, I believe you can come
up with all sorts of scenarios. What I think is the
thing --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why we're wondering
how to write the opinion.
(Laughter.)
MR. MANCINO: And where did the litigant
reasonably rely upon an order of the court, which
apparently the court had authority to issue, regardless
of the court making a mistake or doing something
intentionally --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And the person who did the
reliance was you, I guess?
MR. MANCINO: Yes, that's correct.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it correct that --
who -- was this litigant represented by counsel during
the period when he didn't get the notice of the
September 9 order?
MR. MANCINO: Yes. I filed the habeas
petition. I did anything in connection with the case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So neither the, neither
the prisoner nor you received any notice of the first
goof up?
MR. MANCINO: Well, the first -- well, we
received notice of the judgment on the merits. Then we
filed a motion to alter judgment or for a new trial. It
was not, the order overruling the motion to alter or
amend judgment or the motion for a new trial date was
not received. And the clerk's docket showed it wasn't
mailed out.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I see.
MR. MANCINO: But in the, in that court,
there was a transitioning to this electronic filing,
which not everybody was set up at that particular time;
so apparently the order may have only gone to -- on the
electronic filing system to those who were set up, and
we were not set up on that thing. But the court still
had the obligation to send it out. The court found that
the clerk did not send it out. The clerk found that, or
the court found that we did not have notification. And
the court found that the other side is not prejudiced by
any application.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would your -- would
your proposed exception, does it work the other day? I
mean, let's say the district court entered this order
and set a date certain for you to file the notice of
appeal, and only gave you seven days on his count rather
than 14, and you filed it on the ninth day, in other
words within the 14 days given under the rule.
Would you be out of luck because of what the
district court set out in its order as what's binding,
as opposed to what the resume says? Or could you rely
on the fact the rule says you get 14 days?
MR. MANCINO: Well I would believe you could
then argue that the rule says that, the judge was wrong
in -- you know -- in truncating your appeal time to file
the appeal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why wouldn't the
same approach work the other way? The rule says 14 and
the judge was wrong to give you more?
MR. MANCINO: Well, because the exceptions
to all of these time deadlines, you have cases from this
Court where people untimely file a motion for a new
trial. A new trial motion by rule has to be timely
filed in order to toll your time. And there have been
cases where the motion for new trial has been untimely
filed. The other side didn't say anything. And then
when the ruling is made, the appeal is filed within the
appropriate time.
And this Court has sanctioned that procedure
in connection. I see no difference here, where a
litigant before a court, the court issues an order, you
look at the order. And you abide by the order in
connection with the case.
They do have a reasonable reliance in the
case. And in looking back later on, in connection with
the -- the issue, in connection with the case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You know sometimes,
sometimes district courts take jurisdiction over a case
that they -- that they shouldn't have jurisdiction over.
MR. MANCINO: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes in reliance
on that, you go through a whole trial and it comes up to
the court of appeals and we say huh, there was no
jurisdiction here; too bad.
MR. MANCINO: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though the court said
it and you went through a whole trial in reliance on the
district judge. District judges make mistakes.
MR. MANCINO: Well, that's a whole -- I
believe that's a whole different scenario than presented
here. That goes to the subject matter --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's even worse, it seems
to me. I mean, you've wasted weeks, you know, in trial
and so forth.
MR. MANCINO: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But if it's jurisdictional,
we have to say, you know, too bad. Yes, you were misled
by the judge. In reliance on the district judge, you
expended a lot of time and money, but there was no
jurisdiction. And that's the end of the matter.
MR. MANCINO: Well, the rule I always
remember from law school is that parties cannot
voluntarily confer jurisdiction on a court that does not
have it. And the court, at any point, if they do not
have subject matter jurisdiction, is free to dismiss the
case whether it's at trial level, the appeal level, or
whatever.
This is not that situation. Obviously, the
court by the rule could look into this matter. The
court by the rule could grant relief in connection with
this matter. It's a question whether the three days --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I know I could find this
out by looking at a calendar. Do you remember what day
of the week February 24th was, or 26th?
MR. MANCINO: I believe --
JUSTICE STEVENS: We don't have a weekend
problem, do we?
MR. MANCINO: I believe it was not -- I
don't believe it was a weekend, no.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I looked at this. There's
a time start. And I think it might be the time stamp
when this document was entered on the ultimate appeal.
But -- but something you said at the outset
prompts this question, that -- Did you think that -- the
time runs from $14 days after the date when the district
court's order is entered.
MR. MANCINO: When it's entered. That's
correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And was there a submission
or an implication in your remarks that you thought that
the order was not entered until three days later?
MR. MANCINO: No.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there an entry -- is
there a time entry on the dock -- on court's order?
MR. MANCINO: No. It's a handwritten one
that doesn't say anything --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know that it's a
handwritten one. But that that -- that shows how long
he has to appeal. is there a date when the order was
put on the docket? Does that show on this sheet?
MR. MANCINO: No. There's nothing from the
clerk indicating -- on the docket there is, but nothing
on the document that was sent, because the document only
was sent -- it was just handwritten over the -- on top
of the motion, so there was no way of telling when it
was entered. Because you look back at the history of
this case, when the court dismissed the original
petition, the court had a date on it. It was only 18
days later that it was actually entered by the clerk,
and of course that triggered the time for asking for
reconsideration.
So -- but --
JUSTICE BREYER: What about the weekends? I
mean, maybe the judge -- I -- it looks from my
calendar -- I wondered what day of the week it was. You
don't remember. 2/10, February 10, 2004, what day of
the week was it?
MR. MANCINO: That I cannot answer.
JUSTICE BREYER: It looks like it was the
middle of the week. So maybe there were one or two
weekends. So maybe what the judge's mistake was, he
didn't know how to count the weekend rule.
MR. MANCINO: Well, what I think was done --
JUSTICE BREYER: Which may not be
jurisdictional, the weekend rule.
MR. MANCINO: What I believe is that this
was sent out by mail. So they had, you know, the
three-day mail rule, and that's how you came to the 14
days in connection with the -- put in the 17-day limit
on --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe Arabic numerals
aren't jurisdictional either.
JUSTICE BREYER: They're not. A numeral is
not jurisdictional.
What's -- what's -- what's the three-day
mail rule?
MR. MANCINO: Well, normally if you are
allowed to do an act by mail, you have three days, you
can serve a party and then you have three days to file
with the court as part of the Civil Rules. I sort of
think that's what the judge -- because this was going
out by mail -- he probably didn't get -- I wish I would
have saved the envelope, but I don't have the envelope,
but it probably didn't get to my office for three days
anyway.
JUSTICE BREYER: Speaking of the three-day
mail rule, maybe the judge's intent when he signed this
was that it actually was entered, took effect as of
three days later.
MR. MANCINO: Well, there's really no --
looking at the document, there's no way of telling that.
That is correct. There's no way of telling that, and I
believe that was probably the reasoning of the court
that, you know, it took three days to get mail because
you didn't get -- it wasn't sent out last time,
obviously you did not get the mail the last time, so he
added the three days, and then you have the 14 days to,
you know, perfect or file your notice of appeal to get
it to the court in this case.
So --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All of that might
have -- all those things might have been going on in the
judge's mind, but you don't contest that the 14-day
period was not complied with? You don't have an
argument that you complied with the 14-day period?
MR. MANCINO: No, I do not. We're relying
to the exceptions, and there's a number exceptions on
deadlines that have come out. We have the equitable
tolling, we have the waiver, forfeiture issue. And, you
know, in this case, specific assurance by a court which
in a past opinion seemed to control the date, where a
judge gave you a specific assurance that you could do
something in connection with the case.
The old Harris Truck case is where the
lawyer was on vacation. The judge said well, I'll give
you some extra time. Even though they knew of the
judgment, they knew the time would run, he said I'll
give you extra time to file the appeal because you want
to contact the lawyer who was on vacation. The court of
appeals then said well, the rule didn't apply because
you knew of the order, so -- but that was overlooked
even though by time calculation, everybody was out of
time.
The Eberhart case, they were out of time
because the motion for new trial was filed untimely,
which under the rule required a timely filing of a
motion for a new trial in order to toll your appeal
time.
So this, obviously the motion to reopen was
timely filed, was filed within the 180 days required by
the rule. The other side was served. The other side
had no objection to it and didn't oppose it. The real
issue when you look at an equitable -- sort of an
equitable rule like this, is the other side prejudiced,
and obviously they are not prejudiced.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the things I
think the drafters of the rule wanted to assure is that
there would be a point at which the prevailing party in
the district court could know with certainty there
wasn't going to be further proceedings in the case, and
that's the purpose of the 180-day period and all that.
It's not open-ended.
Under your rule where the actual time for
filing could be at some indefinite point, they'd never
really quite have that assurance, would they?
MR. MANCINO: Well, unless the court
specifically granted to the litigant a specific period
of time, and you know, normally litigants and lawyers do
not ignore what the court says.
--
At least I think as, you know, anyone -- if
this court said that, you have a right to reasonably
rely on what the court said. And it certainly wasn't an
unreasonable period of time that the court was giving in
the case. It wasn't --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what would be
an unreasonable period of time if the two or three days
is not? Would another 10 days?
MR. MANCINO: Well, if you go back to the
rules, you're going into the six months, 180 days, and
then, you know, you would say something. Or if the
court, you know, gave you a year or something by
mistake, you know, it would -- you know, that something
does not sound right here. And then you would look at
it. At least if that were the case, you could probably
go in and get the court to reconsider, bring it to the
attention of the court. Your Honor, we did not have all
of this time. Did you make a mistake? You can always
correct mistakes. But that was not done here, it was
not done by the respondent in this case because they
didn't -- the respondent did not object to the
application to reopen the appeal, did not say anything
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the respondent said
he had no reason at that time to believe that you
wouldn't follow the rule and file within the 14 days.
So if they made an objection, the moment the judge put
down a date that's 17 days later, the judge might say
that's premature.
MR. MANCINO: Well then, the judge may have
said well, I don't -- look at the rule. I don't have
it. I'm going to redraft the order, vacate my order and
put a proper order on in connection with the case. It
would seem to me that at some point in the appellate
process, because when you look at the history that the
Sixth Circuit in this case -- at least when the court
then granted a certificate of appealability, you would
think the respondent would -- what are -- why are you
granting a certificate of appealability when you told us
we have no jurisdiction over this case, or at least from
the two orders anyway, they said they had jurisdiction
over the February 10th order that -- on the appeal. And
the -- then the certificate of appealability was denied,
and normally that would end the case.
The court granted the -- my motion for
reconsideration, and then granted certain issues that
could be briefed on the merits. But once the court
granted the certificate of appealability, it seemed to
me that the other side, well, what is happening here?
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Mancino, I take it that
what you are really proposing is sort of a rule that if
-- if counsel could reasonably be misled to overlook the
mistake by the court, that your reliance upon the
court's mistake should -- should, in fact, be respected.
It's kind of a rule of reasonably misleading; is that
about right?
MR. MANCINO: I believe so.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, that's how we
distinguish your case on your view from the case in
which you get 180 days instead of 14?
MR. MANCINO: Right. Sort of, you know,
reasonably reliant, is it fair.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think we should
have a rule of reason rather than a per se rule.
(Laughter.)
MR. MANCINO: That's the prior case, because
they made that.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question:
Is the order on page 151 of the joint appendix, just
those three lines, that's the entire order that the
judge entered? It just says granted, and motion --
MR. MANCINO: That is what's handwritten on
the original documents. That's it.
JUSTICE STEVENS: He did not make the
findings that the rule requires?
MR. MANCINO: No. But presumably you would
assume that those findings are subsumed within the rule
because the judge found in our favor. The judge denied
the motion to vacate part of it but granted the
reopening to vacate, and of course on the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Because the motion
requires --
MR. MANCINO: -- motion to vacate, you have
days to appeal.
JUSTICE STEVENS: The rule requires that he
make three specific findings which he did not make.
MR. MANCINO: He did not make it, but you
assume that the judge did by granting the motion, and
nobody else said anything about it anyway.
I reserve the time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Marshall?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. MARSHALL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The petitioner's failure to meet the 14-day
statutory deadline for filing his notice of appeal is
fatal to his case for three reasons.
First, the 14-day period is mandatory and
jurisdictional, and Federal district courts do not have
the power to enlarge this time period.
Second, the 14-day rule was not forfeited by
the state of Ohio and may be raised by the court sua
sponte in any event.
Third, even if there could be some sort of
limited equitable exception to the 14-day time
requirement, the petitioner here falls far short of
demonstrating why he is entitled to such extraordinary
relief.
Let me explain why. The petitioner's claim
that notice of appeal time requirements are not
jurisdictional contradicts 150 years of practice,
countless lower court decisions, settled congressional
understanding as to the meaning of its governing --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What type of jurisdiction
are you speaking of? It's certainly not Federal
jurisdiction in the sense of subject matter
jurisdiction, like a specific case arising under Federal
law. What kind of jurisdiction do you have in mind?
MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, I think it is its
own form of subject matter jurisdiction in the same way
that final judgments on appeals are subject matter
jurisdiction. And the reason why is that notice of
appeals are classically jurisdictional in that sense, in
that they transfer the locus of the case from one court
to another. In the appellate system, there's actually a
changing of the jurisdiction, and the notice of appeal
is that triggering mechanism. And in that sense, it is
classically jurisdictional and different from the other
kinds of time limits that this Court addressed in
Kontrick, in versus Eberhart because those took place
within a particular court system, the district court
system, where here there was a transfer of jurisdiction
triggered by the notice of appeal from one court to the
other.
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that just a word game?
It's jurisdictional because it transfers jurisdiction
from one court to the other. Why should that be -- why
does that make it jurisdictional?
MR. MARSHALL: Well, I think, Your Honor,
the same way that final judgments are. I mean, final
judgments are a jurisdictional prerequisite to transfer
from one case to another.
The second reason, Your Honor, by the way,
is congressional, is the congressional reenactment of
the notice of appeal time deadlines, which
also indicates that Congress treats these --
JUSTICE ALITO: Can you think of anything
that's enacted by Congress as jurisdictional?
MR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor, but when
there is a background, as there is in this case, of 150
years of practice where Congress has enacted against
that background, it is presumed to be jurisdictional.
And I'd also point out that with respect to this Court's
jurisdiction, the Court has treated petitions for
certiorari as jurisdictional in civil cases because
there is a statutory underpinning, but has not treated
them as jurisdictional in criminal cases in part because
there is not a statutory underpinning.
JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the latter suggest
that a rule that concerns the transfer of a case from
one court to another is not necessarily jurisdictional?
MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, I think the
latter recognizes the fact that it doesn't necessarily
have to be. That is correct.
However, that Congress and this Court can
treat such a thing because it is in a -- because it is
a -- because it does transfer the case from one to
another. I think that the criminal -- that in the
certiorari case, with respect to criminal, it might be
an indication there that there might be some relation.
But I would also suggest that with respect to certiorari
practice, you've already -- you're already in the
appellate mode and you're not dividing the jurisdiction
between trial courts and appellate courts.
But the quick answer is yes, Your Honor, I
don't think it has to be jurisdictional, but certainly
it can be jurisdictional. And for 150 years, this Court
and Congress has treated this particular division as
jurisdictional.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, it seems to me that's
what we're back to, that it's long been treated as
jurisdictional. But you just said that it's not
sufficient that it's been enacted by Congress and it's
not sufficient that it transfers the case from one court
to another.
So we're back just to history, right?
MR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, it's more
than just history, because I think Congress reenacting
07 against this background for 150 years, that this
issue has been treated as jurisdictional, puts Congress
behind this as well. But here it's also, 150 years is
not a matter of --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The provision of, is it
07?
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does that appear in
the judicial code? Does it appear under the provisions
concerning jurisdiction?
MR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor. 2107 does
not itself mention jurisdiction. However, that is also
true with 2101 in respect to this Court's certiorari
jurisdiction in civil cases. The word jurisdiction is
not mentioned specifically but it --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is under the
heading procedure, court procedure, right?
MR. MARSHALL: It's time for appeal to
court to proceed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that's under a
chapter that deals with procedures, as opposed to
jurisdiction.
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. But this
Court in Barnhart suggested that in determining whether
something is jurisdictional or not, one looks at the
context of the particular location. Here this Rule 21
-- excuse me. Here this statute, 2107, has been enacted
and reenacted against the background of this Court
consistently saying it's jurisdictional and treating
this rule as jurisdictional, and that's since cases as
far along as Edmondson.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You know there have been
a spate of cases that said the word "jurisdiction" has
been vastly overused, it's a word of many meanings. And
you are telling me that the meaning of these statutes is
subject matter jurisdiction, just like it's diversity,
is there a federal question?
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor, in the same
way that amount in controversies are also subject
matter.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But amount in controversy
is in 1332. Congress putting it right there together.
It says diversity of citizenship plus amount in
controversy, all in 1332. Here the limit appears in a
statute, a rule of procedure, not jurisdiction.
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. But that
statute has been enacted against, as I keep
reemphasizing, 150 years of practice, including the
Edmondson case in 1869, where the Court on its own
motion raised the matter as being jurisdictional and
because the time period had not been complied with
dismissed the appeal.
The question essentially isn't whether we're
going to call it jurisdictional or not. The question is
the effect of the particular rule. Some of the lower
courts call its indications of jurisdiction or a
prerequisite to jurisdiction. The question is what the
treatment of this particular requirement is and the
treatment of this particular requirement consistently
for over 150 years has been that it is mandatory,
jurisdictional, non-forfeitable, it can be raised by the
court sua sponte.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What characteristics are
you asserting follow from calling it jurisdictional in
this case?
MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Number one, it can't be
waived, right?
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Number two --
MR. MARSHALL: It's non-forfeitable.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The court of appeals has to
inquire on its own, right?
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Anything else?
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. There's no
equitable exception to it. There is no equitable
exception to it as well if it's jurisdictional. So all
of those three attach to the term "jurisdictional." But
I also think they could equally attach to the notion
that, even if we don't want to call it jurisdictional,
if we don't view it as fitting easily within this
category of subject matter jurisdiction.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Except at least as to the
second, at least as to the second, I don't know of any
matter that a court has to inquire into sua sponte which
is not jurisdictional. That's the one of the three
characteristics that I think we have always attached the
word "jurisdictional" to, I think.
MR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, in Day
versus McDonough in dealing with a habeas, with a habeas
statute of limitations, this Court approved the court of
appeals raising that issue sua sponte, although they --
although in that case the Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It may.
MR. MARSHALL: It may.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But not must.
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not must. And truly with
things we have called jurisdictional, you must, right?
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. However, if
the lower courts wanted to play with the language a
little bit and call it necessary for the invocation of
jurisdiction or a prerequisite --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We could call it
"quasi-jurisdictional." You wouldn't object to that?
MR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor. As
Shakespeare might say, it's not the name. We are
interested in the effect, and the effect here has been
traditionally enforced over 150 years of court practice.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what do you think is
the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How far do you take it?
Suppose this ^ slip is not noticed in the court of
appeals, and then there's a petition for cert, and some
clever law clerk notices that the notice of appeal was
filed in 16 days instead of in 14 days. Would the court
then have to dismiss for want of jurisdiction?
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. I think it
applies in the same way that lack of diversity would
apply or lack of a Federal question could apply, as in
the Mottley case. Even if it was in front of this
Court, if it was recognized in front of this Court, at
that time it would -- it must be dismissed.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's take it a step
further. Let's assume it isn't recognized. Assume he
gets his habeas relief, and three years later some eager
beaver is culling through the records and says, this guy
never should have been in court. Do they rearrest him
and put him into prison?
MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, collateral
attacks for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are not
normally sustained, if that's what the -- if I
understand your question correctly. So that, for
example, in a diversity case, if two years or three
years after it proceeds to final judgment somebody
realizes that both parties were from the same State, the
collateral attack would normally not allow to change
that, to change that result. And I would think that the
same thing would happen here. If the case had proceeded
to final judgment, if there were an error of this type,
as with other types of errors in subject matter
jurisdiction, there would not be an opening for
collateral attack.
JUSTICE BREYER: What about something here I
hadn't run across, called the unique circumstances
doctrine. This Court in Osterneck said this: Where a
party has performed a act which if properly done would
postpone the deadline for filing his appeal -- and
indeed that's what happened here; he postponed the
deadline for filing his appeal -- and has received
specific assurance by a judicial officer that this act
has been properly done -- and here he did receive
specific assurance by a judicial officer that the act
was properly done -- in those circumstances, you can
make a little exception in the interests of justice.
MR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, the unique
circumstances doctrine doesn't apply here because there
wasn't an act which if requested could have been
properly done.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes, the act was that
he filed a motion to reopen, which motion to reopen
postponed the time of appeal. And two things have to
happen with that act. One is you have to get the
district judge to agree; and second, you have to file
the paper.
So that's the act which if properly done
would, in fact, have led to the appeal.
MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, I think that --
JUSTICE BREYER: I agree there were two
parts to it or two acts, if you want.
MR. MARSHALL: But, Justice Breyer, in this
case I think that what would have had to happen is that
the Petitioner would have had to move for 17 days in
order for the act to be properly done. He moved for 14
days.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought what we were
talking about was that if the order had said 14 days
instead of 17, then the act would have been properly
done. That is, the only reason that -- the 16 days,
according to Mr. Mancino the only reason he took 16 days
was the judge authorized that. If the judge hadn't
authorized that, the rule wouldn't have been discarded
and he would have filed in 14 days.
MR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, the judge
-- our argument is in part that the judge had no power
to authorize it. If I understand your question, with
respect to the unique circumstances doctrine, this
doesn't fit in because in the unique circumstances
doctrine the litigant actually has to seek a particular
type of relief and get granted that relief. The
Petitioner here did not seek leave to file his motion of
appeal within 17 days. The Petitioner here sought,
which is the only thing he could do under the rules, is
seek to reopen for 14 days.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he hasn't
received, just quoting from Osterneck, he hasn't
received assurance that the act has been properly done?
MR. MARSHALL: That's right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, if
he came back and said, was my notice of appeal timely or
something, and the judge at that point ruled, then it
might come under that provision. But this is just --
prospectively, he could have filed this timely even
after the judge issued the order. In other words, he
could have filed it on the 14th day. He didn't have to
wait until the 17th day.
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why does that matter? I
mean, also Osterneck I happened to guess involved a case
that took place on Tuesday. This case took place on
Thursday. I mean, I grant you the language literally
you could say doesn't quite fit it, but so what? The
purpose of this Osterneck I take it is to have a very
narrow exception where a judge tells you basically what
to do, and you follow what the judge said, and then, lo
and behold, they hit you with this jurisdictional thing
and you didn't get it right.
Now, that seems to be its purpose, and the
language is very close, so why not follow it?
MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, the purpose of
the unique circumstances doctrine is not to give a
license to litigants to rely on district court errors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be the
very narrow circumstances doctrine, not the unique
circumstances doctrine.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: I notice the court applied
it twice, so it couldn't quite be the unique
circumstances.
MR. MARSHALL: That's right, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question.
Supposing there was a dispute as to whether the order
had been entered on February 10 or February 12. Say his
handwriting was illegible. Would that be a dispute that
would remain open throughout the appellate process?
MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, the question is
when the clerk of court would have entered for the entry
of judgment.
JUSTICE STEVENS: If he'd entered this order
on February 12 or 13 -- I forget which day it was -- the
appeal would have been timely?
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And I'm just -- and the
order was defective because it didn't make findings
required by the rule. And I'm just wondering, supposing
it was ambiguous as to the date it was actually entered.
Would the party then be entitled to rely on the date,
February 27th, set in the order, or would he have a duty
to investigate and find out exactly when the judge
signed the order?
MR. MARSHALL: I think the key question,
Your Honor, I think is when the -- when the order is
entered into the docket, which is done by the clerk of
course. I think that is the triggering time.
JUSTICE STEVENS: My question is what if
that's somewhat ambiguous? A busy court, he handed it
to the clerk and the clerk didn't enter it into the
docket. You're not sure, there's a fact dispute about
that.
MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, that's a
different case. The beginning time period is a
beginning case, if there was some ambiguity there.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand. I'm just
wondering what your view is, how should courts resolve
that kind of dispute? Should that be a dispute that
remains open throughout the appellate process/ There's
a factual dispute as to when the judge signed order.
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. Again, the
factual dispute is when the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If he had written here,
instead of "2-10," he had written down "2-12," then the
prosecutor 3 days later realized he had written down the
wrong date, would that have made the appeal untimely?
MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, I think the
question at that point is what is the time period
entered into the formal docket, and what is the actual
judgment.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And that's ambiguous, I'm
saying. That's ambiguous.
MR. MARSHALL: If for some reason the court
records are jumbled for some reason or another and
nobody can determine when that entry of order is, that's
a different case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: In that case, you then
rely on the February 27 date in the order? Then it must
be permissible to rely on appeal to be filed by 2-27?
In such a case it would be okay.
MR. MARSHALL: Again, Your Honor, the
critical thing with the rule period is the time period
from the entry of judgment.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I know, and I say it's
hard to figure out when the order was actually written
down in the docket.
MR. MARSHALL: I think that the question
that would be required then was for whoever was filing
the notice of appeal to determine when the entry of the
docket is. If that's ambiguous, I think it's obligatory
on the litigant to err on the side of caution, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And not rely on the 2-27
date.
MR. MARSHALL: I would certainly suggest
that a litigant argue on -- err on the side of caution
if at all.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Breyer quoted
from the Osterneck case. There was another statement of
the rule which goes like this: There is a sharply honed
exception covering cases in which the trial judge has
misled a party who could have and probably would have
taken timely action as a trial judge conveyed correct
rather than incorrect information. This case fits right
into that description, doesn't it?
PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: No, Your Honor. The
case that they're citing to is Thompson, and in Thompson
what occurred in that case is that the litigant in that
case --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The case that I'm reading
from is the concurring opinion in Carlisle against
United States. It does cite Thompson.
MR. MARSHALL: Thompson is the case,
Thompson -- this Court has not relied on the unique
circumstances doctrine in 40 years. Buy in Thompson
what occurred was the Petitioner requested a new trial
untimely, but was told by the court that they had timely
requested a new trial. Because they were informed that
they were entitled to a new trial, they did not do
something else, which was file the notice of appeal. So
the court basically sent them down the wrong avenue.
Here there was no wrong avenue that the court -- that
the litigant was being sent down.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they would have filed
that notice of appeal earlier if the judge had said,
your motion for a new trial is untimely. It seems to me
the same as in this case. The judge said: Your motion
is timely, so you're going to have the trigger so much
later. Fine. If the judge had said, your motion is
untimely and you know you've got to get your notice of
appeal in sooner rather than later. Similarly, here the
judge said, well, you've got until 17 days later.
If the judge had done right and said the
-day period, then surely Mr. Mancino would have filed
within that period.
MR. MARSHALL: But, Your Honor, there is
nothing that the court did that prevented the litigant
here from filing on time. There was nothing that would
have prevented the litigation here from filing within
the 14-day period.
And when --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was nothing in
Thompson that prevented filing the notice of appeal.
MR. MARSHALL: Except in Thompson, Your
Honor, he was told that he had the right to proceed on a
motion for new trial. If he had -- Your Honor, I see
that my time is up.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your
answer.
MR. MARSHALL: In Thompson, Your Honor, the
difference is that -- that the litigant was sent down a
different road which was inconsistent with his filing a
notice of appeal. Here there is nothing inconsistent
about filing a notice within 14 days as opposed to 17
days.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Marshall.
MR. MARSHALL: Thank you, Your Honor.
THE COURT: We'll hear from Mr. Stewart.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MR. STEWART: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice
and may it please the Court.
For four basic reasons the deadline for
filing a notice of appeal in a civil case should be
treated as jurisdictional and therefore as nonwaivable.
First, the time limit sent forth in Section 2107
directly implicates the concerns that underlie the
special treatment of jurisdictional issues. It's a
fundamental precept of our legal system that Federal
courts should take special care to avoid adjudicating
cases where Congress has not authorized them to do so.
Or to put it another way, our legal system has
presupposed that the unauthorized exercise of
jurisdiction is an error different in kind from the
misapplication of law in cases that a court is
authorized to adjudicate.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stewart, do you think
this is subject -- that question is subject matter
jurisdiction?
MR. STEWART: We would -- we would
characterize it as a species of appellate jurisdiction.
That is, this Court has often said that it's the
fundamental duty of this Court when doubt is -- when
doubt is apparent, to inquire into its own jurisdiction
and that of the court from which the record comes. And
that division presupposes that there are cases over
which the lower court had subject matter jurisdiction,
over which this Court would not have appellate
jurisdiction.
For example, situations sometimes arise,
particularly in cases that are adjudicated by
three-judge district courts, in which there is a dispute
as to whether a particular district court order is
directly appealable to this Court or should go instead
to the court of appeals. And if somebody comes to this
Court and this Court determines that the appeal should
have gone to the court of appeals instead, the error is
characterized as one of appellate jurisdiction. This
Court lacks jurisdiction to review the ruling even
though there's nothing to suggest that the case as a
whole fell outside the subject matter jurisdiction of
the district court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, that's one
those interesting examples. We lack jurisdiction of the
case but we have power to order it refiled, to vacate
the order and have it refiled, don't we?
MR. STEWART: That is an anomaly. The Court
has said on occasion that because it lacks appellate
jurisdiction it has no power to do anything with the
case except to vacate the order. And I think that's a
court that I'm not going to try to explain.
(Laughter.)
MR. STEWART: But I think Mr. Marshall has
identified the second example, namely the final decision
requirement of 28 USC 1291. That is, that's universally
conceded to be a jurisdictional rule, even though it has
nothing to do with whether the district court had
subject matter jurisdiction over the case. It is simply
whether this particular decision over -- for which
review is sought falls within the appellate jurisdiction
of the court of appeals. And our point --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Stewart, should we
repudiate the unique circumstances doctrine?
MR. STEWART: I don't think you need to -- I
think you should repudiate any conception that Federal
courts have freewheeling authority to excuse
noncompliance with statutory time limits for taking
appeals.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the unique
circumstances doctrine is one circumstance in which
courts, say yeah, you can excuse it.
MR. STEWART: Well, I -- I think actually
both Harris and Thompson are explicable on other
grounds. And may even be correct in more limited ways.
For example, Harris --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But on the grounds for
which they have been taken as authority, is it your view
that we should repudiate those grounds?
MR. STEWART: Yes. With respect to civil
cases for which the time for taking an appeal is
specified by statute, it's our view to the extent that
Harris and Thompson would otherwise support the
proposition that district courts may excuse
noncompliance with the time limits, those cases should
be repudiated.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- in criminal.
MR. STEWART: In criminal cases the time for
taking an appeal is not specified by statute. It's
imposed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b).
But there's no statutory basis for it. There was up
until 1988 a provision of Title 18 of the U.S. Code,
Section 3772, that specifically authorized this Court to
promulgate rules that would establish the time for
filing a notice of appeal --
JUSTICE BREYER: But in -- though of course,
you'd have to confine it very narrowly, I take that
doctrine, if there weren't a statute, you read it into
the rule. So there is a statute and you read the
statute as saying well there could be very some very
narrow circumstances that Congress would have been
willing to make an exception. For example it is a
couple of days and the judge tells you, "do it" or lets
you do it. It's roughly the same thing, isn't it?
MR. STEWART: Well I think it makes a
fundamental difference that there is a statute in place.
And certainly with respect to circuit certiorari
petitions coming from the court of appeals to this
Court, this Court has recognized that distinction to be
fundamental.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're sure habeas
cases are classified for this purpose as civil rather
than criminal?
MR. STEWART: Yes, there's no -- no dispute
about that. And indeed if the -- if this case were
classified as civil for purposes of -- I mean, as
criminal for purposes of the time limit for taking an
appeal, it would have been far out of time under Federal
Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b). Indeed the authority
of the district court to have granted the reopening
period 180 days later wouldn't have been present in the
criminal context.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Looking at the rule,
it does require these findings. Has that been
interpreted to require that they be written on the
record or is that simply something that's supposed to
guide the district court?
MR. STEWART: I think the courts of appeals
have not required that they be written on the record but
have required that there be a basis appearing in the
record for those findings. So, for instance, if
Petitioner's counsel had filed a document asking to
reopen in the time, but had not represented that he had
not been informed of the judgment, then I think that if
the court had granted the reopening, that could be set
aside on appeal on the ground that there was no support
in the record for such a finding. But I don't believe
the courts of appeals have required there be explicit
findings as opposed to findings that are implicit in the
grant of the reopening.
The point I was going to make about the
certiorari petitions is that this Court's Rule 13.1
imposes a 90-day limit for filing a cert petition in all
cases. It is not divided between civil and criminal.
But this Court has recognized that the 90-day limit has
a very different status is criminal cases than in civil
cases. That is Rule 13.2 of the rules of this Court
states that when a cert petition is jurisdictionally out
of time, the clerk is directed not to file it. And Rule
.2 cites USC 21.01(c).
So the clear implication is that the Court
recognizes the time limit imposed by statute in civil
cases to be a jurisdictional limit. And the crucial
point of Rule 13.2 is not simply that it uses the word
jurisdictionally. It's that it gives an instruction to
the clerk not to file the petition regardless of whether
any other party objects. It's the very type of thing
that a court will do as to matters of its jurisdiction,
as to matters over which it has an obligation to take
cognizance, regardless of the other party's objection.
In criminal cases by contrast the 90-day
rule applies under the rules, but the Court has
recognized that it retains the authority to grant
petitions that are untimely filed even in cases where
the other party objects.
The other thing I would say about 2107(a)
and it's -- part of it is reprinted at page 16 of the
Government's brief. In the last full paragraph of page
, it says, the basic time limit for appeals in similar
cases is set by 28 U.S.C 2107(a), which states that --
and then the part we haven't reproduced says except as
otherwise provided in this section.
And then it goes on to say no appeal shall
bring any judgment order or decree in an action, suit or
proceeding of a civil nature before a court of appeals
for review unless notice of appeal is filed within 30
days.
And the significance of this provision, this
language, is it doesn't simply say a notice of appeal
must be filed within 30 days. Language like that would
conceivably leave open the question of what happens if
the notice of appeal is untimely filed. This language
actually says if a notice of appeal is not filed within
days, the appeal will not bring the judgment --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it begins with the
exception as provided in subparagraph (c).
MR. STEWART: That's correct. So we're not
saying that the 30-day limit is absolute --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah.
MR. STEWART: -- but we're saying that the
rule specifies that if the various time restrictions are
not complied with, the appeal will not bring -- I'm
sorry, the appeal shall not bring the judgment, order,
or decree before the court of appeals. This is
specifically framed as a limitation on the authority of
the reviewing court.
JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think, if we
did go to Thompson and looked at that, this would be a
fortiori from Thompson, as described in Osterneck, was a
case in which the judge simply said from the bench look,
your -- your -- the new trial motion is timely, though
it wasn't; it was out of by two days. While here, we
have a formal court order, it is a formal order entered
with a -- you know, stamp of the judge, and it says you
have till the 27th to file.
MR. STEWART: Well, are two things we would
say about Thompson. The first is that as this Court
explained in its recent decision in Hibbs versus Winn,
it's long been recognized that a timely motion for
reconsideration will suspend the finality of the
judgment and toll the time for taking an appeal. And
the Court in Hibbs versus Winn further explained that
under certain circumstances, even an untimely motion for
reconsideration will have that effect, if the judge
appropriately considers it on the merits.
And Thompson can be explained as holding
simply that where the Government does not object and the
district court evinces an intent to treat the motion as
timely and consider it on the merits, it will suspend
the finality of the judgment I don't think Thompson has
to read -- has to be read to stand for a broader
equitable principle.
The other thing I'd say about Thompson is
that for better or for worse, the Government's brief in
opposition in Thompson, and the case was decided on the
cert papers, didn't cite 28 U.S.C. 2107; it relied
exclusively on the time limit that was stated in the
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure. Therefore the
Court in Thompson was not required to grapple with
congressionally imposed limits.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Stewart.
Mr. Mancino, you have four minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL MANCINO, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. MANCINO: If this were a case where
someone just missed the 30-day deadline, I don't think
we would be talking. We are talking about a case where
a judge properly found, properly ruled that notice was
not given and had the authority to reopen the case. And
we talk about mandatory and jurisdiction of the case.
All that were involved in this case is how is the case
moved from one court to another.
And the -- was it moved properly in this
case? The unique circumstances, I think you cannot find
a more compelling case for unique circumstances.
Did the party rely upon the court? Here you
have a handwritten notation from the court, signed by
the judge --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Mancino, does the
record tell us how you got notice of that order?
MR. MANCINO: No, it doesn't. But I mean, I
did get notice of it. It came in the mail, but it
doesn't --
JUSTICE STEVENS: You, you got that order in
the mail?
MR. MANCINO: In the mail, correct. And
that's why I believe the three days was added, thinking
of the mail rule that we have three additional days to
do it in connection with the case. And that's how I
believe the, how the 17 days came up.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I asked this once
before: Did the document you received show the dates
that it was entered on the docket, so you knew when the
days was running from?
MR. MANCINO: No, the only information it
had was the printed -- the printed date by the judge.
Did not show it was entered that same day.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but in the -- in this
thing, it says entered on February 10.
MR. MANCINO: Yeah, that's correct. The
docket does show that.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But how did you find out
it had been entered on February 10? Because you did
know that at the time you filed your notice of appeal.
MR. MANCINO: Well, I just went off what the
date on the -- the handwritten date on the pleading we
received from the court. It said February 10, so we
just put it in there. Didn't go to the actual docket to
see if, in fact, it was entered. As you can see, orders
were not -- in this case were not entered on date that
the judge signified anyway.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is, this is all at
the top of page 151 of the joint appendix, right?
That's the that entire thing.
MR. MANCINO: That is the -- well, it is
printed on that. But I mean, if you look at the
original document --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. It was
handwritten --
MR. MANCINO: It's a handwritten --
handwritten by the judge in, in the case. So --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it says when it was
signed by the judge. It doesn't say when it was entered
on the docket, when it was entered by the clerk.
MR. MANCINO: No. It says when the judge
signed it. That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: But it says it in the
index, it says -- it says docket entries. 2-10, it says
entered 2-10, on page 11. On page 11.
MR. MANCINO: Yeah, that's correct. But
that's from the docket --
JUSTICE BREYER: Received. So-
MR. MANCINO: But the document we received
from the Court just has -- you know -- the handwritten
notation on it, file your appeal by --
JUSTICE ALITO: What would you, what would
you have had to have done to find out when it was
entered on the docket? Could you have accessed that
electronically? Or would you have to go to the court,
to --
MR. MANCINO: Well, probably I could not
have -- at that time, I mean I could do it now, but at
that time you'd have to go over to the courthouse, just
like we walked on orders of appeal over to the
courthouse, had it stamped by the clerk there, and
figured that was the end of it and we were on our way to
the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati. Thanks.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Mancino. The case is submitted.
