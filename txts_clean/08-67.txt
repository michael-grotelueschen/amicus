CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

Mr. Buffone.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL J. BUFFONE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BUFFONE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
When a jury's acquittal resolves an issue in
a defendant's favor, that determination is final and the
government may not seek an inconsistent determination of
that issue from a second jury. Unlike acquittals, hung
counts are not verdicts. They decide nothing, and
therefore a hung count cannot be inconsistent with an
acquittal. A straightforward application of this
Court's decision in Ashe v. Swenson is all that is
called for in this case. A new rule is not necessary.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Buffone, may I raise
one preliminary issue? And it's an issue which is --
does not go to the reason we took the case, but I'd like
your response to it. Your argument, your Ashe v.
Swenson argument, assumes, as you have said in the
brief, that the -- that the verdicts of acquittal
essentially determined that your client did not possess
insider knowledge, and I question whether the verdicts
of acquittal did necessarily establish that fact. I've
looked at the -- at the jury instructions, and I will be
candid to say I did not parse the whole jury
instruction, so you may very well correct me in the
assumption that I'm going to make. But the point of the
-- of the jury instruction that seemed to go to your
argument is set out on page 105 of the Joint Appendix,
and the judge is telling the jurists what they had to
find. And one of them was that your client made any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading as charged.
It seems to me that the jury under that
instruction could have come back with a verdict of
acquittal simply on the assumption that your client had
not made affirmative statements at the -- at the meeting
in question, therefore he had no obligation to correct
any statements, because it is not clear from this
instruction that he had to correction the statements of
other people who omitted material facts, and that
therefore the only thing that the verdict proves or the
only thing that the verdict may have assumed is that he
didn't speak up and say anything.
Is that a possible analysis?
MR. BUFFONE: I do not believe so, Your
Honor, for two reasons. First, under the Ashe test as
interpreted by this Court in Dowling, the record as a
whole must be analyzed. And in Dowling the Court looked
at admissions made by the defendant's attorney during
the course of the second proceeding that identification
of his client was not an issue. Similarly here, looking
at the entirety of the record, in its arguments closing
and opening, and most importantly in its
cross-examination of Mr. Yeager, the government made
clear to the jury its theory of omissions. And that
theory of omission was that Mr. Yeager when he was at
the 2000 Analysts Conference had a duty to stand up and
correct omissions if there were any misstatements made
by others. They argued to the jury that he would be
guilty of omissions if he did not affirmatively correct
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, no, I agree that did
seem to be the point of the cross-examination, and in
fact I guess you set it out in one of the briefs. But
is that enough? To my knowledge, we've never held that
that is enough to convert or, let's say, to -- for us to
assume, despite a more protean jury instruction, that
the jury necessarily had to find a fact. And I guess
maybe my question boils down to is: Why should what
perhaps consumed 60 or 80 seconds of cross-examination
suffice to tighten up a jury instruction which -- which
basically is open-ended?
MR. BUFFONE: Well, Your Honor, first there
was more to the trial record than a snippet of
cross-examination. Again, in opening statement the
government began by arguing to the jury that Mr. Yeager
was the man behind the screen, that he was --
JUSTICE ALITO: That's the government's --
that's the government's argument. And in order to
convict for securities fraud based on an omission, isn't
it necessary for there to be a duty to disclose? And
what would prevent -- how can we be sure that the jury
here did not find that there was no securities fraud
because, insofar as the government was proceeding on an
omissions theory, your client didn't have a duty to
disclose, did not cause a material fact to be omitted.
MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, first, the
instructions permitted alternative ways to reach the
first element of securities fraud, and one of the three
alternatives was either misstatements or omissions. And
I think the instruction, for all of its frailty, was
clear that the jury could convict on an omissions
theory. Now, Your Honor's question --
JUSTICE ALITO: I agree with that, but why
couldn't they find that there was no securities fraud
based on an omissions theory because there wasn't any
duty on Mr. Yeager's part to disclose?
MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, the indictment was
an integrated theory of fraud, that it charged that Mr.
Yeager and others had planned to make misrepresentations
and material omissions for one purpose, and that purpose
was to enhance the price of Enron stock so that they
could later engage in insider trading to sell that
stock. The omissions theory was grounded in the
indictment. It was elucidated by the instructions, and
it was clarified so that there could be no uncertainty
by the cross-examination and arguments of counsel.
This jury -- under an Ashe analysis, the
question is what did this jury believe and what did they
rationally decide?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Ashe is quite a
different case. Ashe is a seriatim prosecution. It was
one event, a robbery. There were six victims. Victim
number one, the charge relating to victim number one,
was an acquittal. That necessarily decided that the
defendant was not among the robbers. So that is quite a
different situation from what we have here.
MR. BUFFONE: Justice Ginsburg, first, it is
my belief that seriatim prosecutions raise no greater
threat to the core values of double jeopardy than was
raised here. Those core values are, first of all, the
finality of acquittals; and the acquittal here was
offended by any effort to retry an issue of fact
necessarily decided.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're not contending
that double jeopardy itself was at issue? In other
words, claim preclusion. There would be no claim
preclusion, so we're talking only about issue
preclusion?
MR. BUFFONE: Yes, Your Honor, I would like
to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That means it was
necessarily, the issue was necessarily decided?
MR. BUFFONE: That's correct, Your Honor.
We do not argue claim preclusion here. Our argue is
issue preclusion or previously known as collateral
estoppel before clarification by this Court.
Your Honor, to the question of seriatim
prosecution, again, although Ashe was in a sense a
seriatim prosecution, in all of the Ashe-type cases
decided by this Court jeopardy had not even attached,
let alone terminated.
The issue we believe should be addressed in
terms of what was the finality of the judgment. The
finality of the judgment here were six acquittals.
Those acquittals were final and were not subject to
redetermination. The issue preclusive effect arises
from the jury's acquittals, not from the hung counts,
the hung counts which were not final and which resolved
nothing.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the hung counts are
equivalent, equivalent to an acquittal?
MR. BUFFONE: No, Your Honor, I think
precisely the opposite. Hung counts have none of the
force of an acquittal. They have none of what this
Court has historically recognized as the powerful way
that a jury speaks when it acquits in cases such as
Martin Linen, where the court recognized that. The hung
counts historically, as we set out in our brief, were
not even accepted at common law as an option for a jury.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But we said -- we said in
Ashe, didn't we, that you should take into account all
the circumstances in determining what was decided in the
first acquittal, all the circumstances. How can -- how
can you close your eyes to the circumstance that is
alleged here, that the -- the hung jury portion of the
jury's verdict is simply inconsistent with the acquittal
portion, and therefore you should not count the
acquittal for double jeopardy purposes? Isn't this part
of the total circumstances?
MR. BUFFONE: Justice Scalia, first, we
believe that the -- I believe that the Ashe test relates
to the total circumstances on the record. What is it
from the record that the Court can derive meaning from?
The Court can derive meaning from all that was presented
to the jury, and from all that the jury decided. In its
hung counts, the jury did not speak with the unanimity
and the finality that it did in its acquittals. As this
Court, speaking through -- in both the majority and the
concurring opinions, dissenting opinions in Sattazahn,
recognized, hung counts speak nothing.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in a sense that's
Justice Scalia's point, that the jury has in effect told
us nothing, and in effect that argument hurts your case
in one sense. Hung counts are meaningless.
MR. BUFFONE: Justice Kennedy, I agree that
the hung counts are meaningless and that is my point,
but I believe that it does further our analysis and the
proper analysis that this Court should engage in. And
that is, do the acquittals have finality, and is there
anything inconsistent with the jury's inability to reach
a determination with the finality of its acquittals?
The jury did not speak unanimously in its acquittals.
There is no record way to determine why they failed to
reach a determination, and they are therefore not
inconsistent with the final determination --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It shows -- it shows that
-- that the point on which they -- you assert they were
unanimous and the point on which you say later
prosecution should be disallowed was in fact a point on
which the jury was confused, because they would have
come out the other way if indeed they were unanimous on
the counts that -- that acquitted. They should have
come out the same way on the -- on the hung counts.
MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, we simply don't
know that. The jury may have failed to reach a verdict
for any number of reasons. On the basis of this record,
it's quite possible that the reason that the jury failed
to reach a verdict was that it had 176 counts before it;
that the jury, as set out in our reply brief, had made
known to the district court that it was under severe
financial stress. The jurors wanted the trial to be
over so that they could get back to their full-time
employment, and one of the jurors actually asked to be
removed from the jury because of that financial
distress.
In the face of that, the court gave a very
unusual Allen charge; that after the jury had sent out a
note saying that they were deadlocked, the court issued
an Allen charge and 70 minutes later discharged the
jury. It -- the -- the point, Your Honor, is that we
will never know why this jury --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The point is that they were
deadlocked and would not have been deadlocked, assuming
we don't inquire into -- into the issue that Justice
Souter raised -- they were deadlocked and would not have
been deadlocked if indeed they made the -- the acquittal
finding that you're relying upon for double jeopardy.
MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, we know that they
acquitted. That is a certainty. We have finality to
those acquittals. They were unanimous and are not
subject to question again. They cannot be subject to
appeal, and they cannot be subject to overturning, even
if they are egregiously erroneous.
When we lay next to that the hung counts and
the way that hung counts have historically been looked
at, first not tolerated by courts: Coercive means
applied depriving jurors of food and drink and heat in
cold climates until they reached a verdict; contemporary
law where we permit Allen charges in a quest for
unanimity to, wherever possible, have a jury speak its
will. We cannot equate, in the light of that history
and the firm precedent of this Court, an inability to
reach a decision with the finality and persuasion of an
acquittal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if Powell
extends to subsequent prosecutions -- I know you argue
that it doesn't, but if it does, isn't it unusual that
the defendant is in better shape if a jury hangs on the
non-acquitted count than if he is convicted on the non-
acquitted count?
MR. BUFFONE: Well, Your Honor, that's a --
a two-edged sword, Mr. Chief Justice. The defendant is
on the opposite horns of that dilemma. If the counts
are not joined, then the effect of the acquittal would
be to bar them by res judicata. So by joinder, he's on
the other side of that fence. It's, as this Court
recognized, whose ox is being gored in Powell by either
the acquittals or the convictions. Well, this is a case
of whose ox is being gored by the joinder, and it should
not be dispositive. Collateral estoppel effect should
apply to counts within an indictment just as res
judicata would apply if they were separated.
JUSTICE BREYER: It's an obvious question, I
guess. I would just like to hear your answer directly.
Case 1, count 1, selling drugs; count 2, using the
telephone to sell the drugs. All right? The jury
acquits of the first, convicts of the second. Logically
impossible, but permitted under the law, right?
MR. BUFFONE: I agree, Your Honor. Under
Powell --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Case 2 --
MR. BUFFONE: -- there is no question. We
have conflicting verdicts, and we are not going to try
to determine what the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Absolutely
illogical. Case 2, there is no count 1. Case 2,
telephone count, hung jury; we retry it. Permitted,
right?
MR. BUFFONE: Now, Your Honor, that would
depend on what happened at the trial.
JUSTICE BREYER: All that happened was that
they hung.
MR. BUFFONE: Well, if they hung, Your
Honor, yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Case 2, hung jury,
telephone count; we retry it. All right. So now why is
it when we put them together and, case 3, count 1,
substantive drugs, acquitted; count 2, telephone, hung
jury. Well, in case 2 we could get a retrial of the
telephone count. Why can't we get a retrial of the
telephone count now?
MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, it would depend.
JUSTICE BREYER: All that happened is they
are retrying it just as they did in case 2. Why does
the presence of count 1 there mean that they can't retry
MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, the presence of
count 1 in your hypothetical is not dispositive. An
acquittal on count 1 says --
JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I'm going too fast
because you didn't take the cases in. Do you want me to
repeat them? Maybe it's too complicated.
I'm just saying case 1, count 1, the
substantive count, conviction. On count 2, telephone
count, acquittal. Everybody agrees that's permissible.
Case 2 is only the telephone. That's all they indicted
him for. And if they have a hung jury, you can, can't
you, retry him?
MR. BUFFONE: Yes, sir.
JUSTICE BREYER: So, now, when we have case
, which is the same as case 1 except that, instead of
convicting him, they had a hung jury, why can't you
retry him, just as you could in case 2?
MR. BUFFONE: Because a hung jury resolves
nothing, Your Honor. It doesn't --
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, everybody agrees it
resolves nothing, and that's why you could retry him in
-- that's why you could retry him in case 2, because it
resolves nothing. So if you could retry him in case 2,
why can't you retry him in case 3? What does the
presence of this other substantive count have to do with
it. Since it never would have blocked the conviction on
count 2, why does it stop you from retrying count 2?
It would never have blocked the conviction
of count 2. Why does it stop you from retrying it?
Do you see -- do you see my --
MR. BUFFONE: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the logical point I
thought the other side was making, and maybe they're not
because it seems to be striking you as surprising or
maybe I'm not making it in a clear way. But what I
wanted was a clear answer to it.
MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, I believe the --
the clear answer is that for collateral estoppel to
attach, there must be a necessary determination of a
factual issue, and the necessary determination of that
factual issue can occur in your count 1 through an
acquittal or a conviction. It cannot occur through a
hung count because there is nothing to be resolved.
There is nothing that would be necessarily decided.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Buffone, you're --
you're going through a logical analysis. If I
understand your position, the logical analysis is not
going to win the case for you because, as I understand
the case that we've got in front of us, we have in
effect two lines of authority, two models, that describe
what the law might be in these circumstances.
One model, on -- on the assumption that -- that the
acquittals determined what you say they did, on that
model there -- there is -- there is an issue preclusion
that is raised.
On the second model, the model of what we do
in the case of a hung jury, there is no -- of course, no
preclusion, and there is no bar to a retrial. And we've
simply got both in the same case. The question is:
Which model do we follow? Do we say preclusion is the
most important issue here, or do we say the
open-endedness and uncertainty of the hung jury, the --
the failure to reach a verdict, is the model that --
that tells us what we ought to do? How do we choose
between those two possibilities, each of which is open
to us?
MR. BUFFONE: Yes, Your Honor, I believe
that that is a clear choice, and the rationale for the
clarity of that choice is that acquittals have long been
recognized as being important for finality purposes for
double jeopardy law. So, for example --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Look, I know that, and --
and by the same token, hung juries have long been
recognized as raising no bar to a further trial. And
the question is: Why are the values in the -- the
acquittal case predominating, as you say they are, over
the values of the retrial possibilities? Why do I
choose one rather than another?
MR. BUFFONE: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the
Perez line that tells us that when there is manifest
necessity arising from a jury not reaching a verdict,
that retrial is appropriate following a hung count.
That line of cases stands in -- as I believe is the
basis of Your Honor's question, stands in sharp contrast
to the line of cases that require that jury acquittals
be given final effect, cases like Foo Fong -- Fong Foo,
excuse me.
JUSTICE SOUTER: We have got both.
MR. BUFFONE: All right, so what --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what is it -- and I
would almost suggest THAT it has to be something outside
the lines of authority, because the issue here is which
line of authority are you going to pick. What is it
outside the lines of authority that says we should -- we
should pick the acquittal model rather than the hung
jury model to determine what to do here?
MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, I think we should
go -- the Court should go to the history of its double
jeopardy jurisprudence, and that makes clear that the
core concepts underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause are:
First finality of jury verdicts; and, second, to avoid
all of the constitutional perils of successive trials,
because successive trials --
JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this about the
finality of jury verdicts? Is -- does the Constitution
require either Federal or State law to permit the -- a
partial verdict?
MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, I do not believe
that -- I am not aware of a constitutional underpinning
for that, but certainly the practices in the courts are
to permit partial verdicts.
JUSTICE ALITO: In every State?
MR. BUFFONE: I do not know the answer to
that question.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the Constitution
doesn't require that, then why does the Constitution, in
your view, require that issue preclusion occur when the
jury acquits on certain counts but hangs on other
counts? If -- if a partial verdict were not required,
and if the jury came back and said, we -- we've reached
a verdict on some counts but not all counts, the remedy
would be a mistrial on all counts and a retrial on all
counts.
Why -- why is it does the Constitution
require a different result if Federal law or State law
chooses to allow the return of a partial verdict?
MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, I don't believe
that it would be a different result because I think in
most jurisdictions, as I understand it, the reaction to
that kind of a split verdict would be to try to get the
jury to reach a full and final verdict, to give some
form of an Allen charge to encourage additional
deliberations, to seek unanimity in the jury's verdict.
Where we don't have that unanimity, the Court is forced
for collateral estoppel, for issue preclusion purposes,
to Justice Ginsburg's point, not to claim preclusion
issues.
If we set aside claim preclusion, the Perez
line of cases tells us to do what we do with claim
preclusion. For issue preclusion, the question is, is
there some finality to what the jury did, in your
hypothetical its partial verdict that speaks to the
counts that it was not able to resolve. And if it
speaks, that after the Ashe analysis that there was an
issue necessarily decided, then there is a bar under the
doctrine of issue preclusion to the re-litigation of
that question.
If there are no further questions, I would
like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Dreeben.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Two separate lines of double jeopardy
analysis lead to the conclusion that the government can
retry hung counts that occur in a verdict simultaneously
with acquittals. The first is the principle that the
government may, under the doctrine of continuing
jeopardy, try to obtain a verdict when a jury is hung.
The basic principle there is that the government is
entitled to one full and fair opportunity to convict and
that the hung counts, when the jury cannot agree,
interrupt and prevent the government from achieving
that. Double jeopardy therefore does not bar the
government from completing its opportunity to obtain a
verdict.
The second doctrinal line is that which
grows out of the Powell case. Collateral estoppel is
premised on the idea that the jury has acted rationally.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are asking us
for a pretty dramatic extension of Powell. Powell is
not a case involving subsequent prosecutions.
MR. DREEBEN: No. Powell was a case in
which the Court rejected the doctrine of collateral
estoppel as a means of upsetting a mixed verdict of
acquittals and convictions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because
in the same proceeding you have two different jury
verdicts, one going the other way and one -- obviously,
one way and one the other way. So to protect the jury's
conclusions, you couldn't give effect to one without
undermining the other.
It's a very different case here. The only
jury determination you have is the acquittal. If you
give effect -- if you don't give effect to the findings
in the acquittal, you are undermining the jury, the only
determination by the jury.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think that it
undermines that determination, Mr. Chief Justice,
because the acquittals will stand as acquittals, and
they will bar reprosecution on that offense. To the
extent that there are determinations that are made by
the acquittals that are independent of any inconsistency
with the hung counts, that too can have collateral
estoppel effect in a successive prosecution.
But I think the crucial thing here is that
this is not properly viewed as a successive prosecution
for double jeopardy purposes. Ashe v. Swenson and the
cases --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why not? It is a
successive prosecution.
MR. DREEBEN: No, it is not in the sense, I
think, Justice Stevens that the Court used that in Ashe.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It is in the sense of an
indictment that took place after the other acquittal.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, that indictment simply
embodies non-jeopardy-barred counts that --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there a difference
in the fact that in the first case where there was a
conflicting simultaneous verdict, one can explain the
acquittal on grounds of leniency or compromise or
something like that, that says that, therefore, we will
give effect to the -- the conviction when they're
simultaneous because of the reasons why there may be
irrationality in the conflict. But there is no reason
to doubt the -- the validity of the acquittal in this
case.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, no, I think that there
is, Justice Stevens, if on the theory that the
Petitioner propounds the verdict on the acquittals is
inconsistent with the mistrial. And that's the only way
in which collateral estoppel could apply, only if the
jury had necessarily determined a fact on the acquittals
that should have led to acquittals on the insider
trading counts.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But if they had time. And
when you have 150 counts, it's entirely possible they
just didn't reach a decision on it.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- Petitioner's theory
would be identical if there were one insider trading
count. And I think that for purposes of this case, the
Court should not get too distracted by the number of
counts, because all of the insider trading counts turned
on a common core of fact. They were all resolved
identically --
JUSTICE STEVENS: When you have a case in
which there is no conflict between a guilty and an
innocent verdict, there isn't -- there is no reason to
doubt the integrity of the acquittal.
MR. DREEBEN: We're not questioning the
integrity of the acquittal as far as it has direct
double jeopardy application. The question is whether
the doctrine of collateral estoppel ought to be applied.
JUSTICE BREYER: And why not? Because the
answer to my question was exactly what Justice Stevens
said. Why is it that -- that if you could have the
inconsistent verdicts in Powell, well, then, why can't,
since they hung, couldn't you try him again on the hung
count? And the answer is, because you're trying him
again.
And that's why we have all the briefs that
we have, because the only way to answer this is to look
and see if the policies that underlie the collateral
estoppel part of double jeopardy apply here. And I
can't think of one that doesn't. I can't think of one
single one that wouldn't apply.
Maybe there are some. And I can't think of
any reason for allowing the government to have a second
bite at this apple. What is the reason?
MR. DREEBEN: The reason, Justice Breyer, is
that the hung counts do not constitute a resolution in
favor of the defendant.
JUSTICE BREYER: Of course they don't. Of
course they don't. Suppose that they never brought up
that hung count. Then you wouldn't even have the first
bite at the apple. So you would think it would be a
fortiori you could go ahead. But that's the case; you
clearly can't go ahead.
MR. DREEBEN: But there's a reason for that,
Justice Breyer, that is grounded in double jeopardy
policies. And I think it goes to the question that
Justice Souter asked as well, why the Court should
prefer the double jeopardy doctrine that allows the
government to retry the hung counts when they are all
brought together in the same proceeding? And that is
this -- and I think it's made most vivid by imagining
Ashe v. Swenson in a slightly different posture.
Ashe v. Swenson involved robbery of six
individuals at a poker game. The government indicted
each one of them as a separate robbery and the
government tried one of them first. And in that one,
the jury's acquittal was understood to mean that the
defendant was not the robber. If the government could
go sequentially through and try the other five, it has
the opportunity to try to wear the defendant down or
refine its case or improve its case in a way that the
Court regarded as impermissible.
But suppose that in Ashe the government
hadn't done that, it had brought all six robbery
prosecutions together, and the jury returned one verdict
of acquittal on one robber and on the other five it
hung? In that situation I think -- which is the
situation we have here --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the reason for that is
there are doubts about the integrity of the acquittal.
They probably compromised, just to say not to be too
tough on --
MR. DREEBEN: But, Justice Stevens, that is
identical to this case. There is no difference to this
case --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, here you have
sequential prosecutions, and there is no reason to
question the integrity of the acquittal in this case.
MR. DREEBEN: No. But, Justice Stevens, if
you would question the integrity of the acquittal, if
the jury acquits on one robber and hangs on five, that
is this case. The only difference in this case is it's
a securities fraud case.
JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't think it had
anything to do with integrity of anything. I thought
what it had to do with is that they are being tried at
the same time. And to test that out in my mind, I
imagine this. In February we try the individual for the
drug count, he's acquitted. In June we bring a
telephone count. Absolutely forbidden, right?
MR. DREEBEN: Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why should the
government be one whit better off because, in addition
to doing that, they happened to bring a telephone count
in January along with the other?
MR. DREEBEN: There are two reasons for
that, Justice Breyer. The first is that the Double
Jeopardy Clause is not aimed at preventing the
government from attempting to bring its -- all of its
charges in one indictment against the defendant. What
the collateral estoppel component is aimed at is the
government going sequentially, carving its prosecution
up into pieces, and trying in different attempts.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- isn't -- isn't the
real problem that you raised by your answer the
following problem: That in this age in which there are,
as Justice Breyer's hypo suggests, lots of overlapping
criminal statutes -- you can indict not only for drugs
but for telephones, and I don't know what other
overlapping crimes there -- there may be. Therefore,
that gives the government by joining a lot of
overlapping charges or lots of charges with common
elements in either one indictment through various counts
or simply by a series of indictments to be tried
together -- it gives the government a bigger chance of
getting a hung jury or some irrational resolution on
some of those issues. And if the government can bring
loads of counts, increase the likelihood of getting a
hung jury on one issue or one indictment, the government
in effect has a key to avoiding just what Justice
Breyer's hypothetical suggested.
If they wait and bring the second count in
June, there's an issue preclusion. But if they bring it
together, they've got an irrational verdict and there's
no issue preclusion. Therefore, isn't the policy behind
both double jeopardy and the issue preclusion extension
a policy that argues in favor of saying don't let the
government have all these bites at the apple, because in
fact it results or can result in seriatim prosecutions?
What's -- what's your response to that argument?
MR. DREEBEN: My response to that, Justice
Souter, is that double jeopardy has always consisted of
a balance of values. There is of course the interest
that Your Honor has identified, but the countervailing
interest is that the government should have one full and
fair opportunity to convict a defendant on charges that
have been preferred by a grand jury on a showing of
probable cause, and that does not occur when the hung
counts deprive the government of that one opportunity.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But does the -- does the
government ask for something more than one fair chance
when it comes in with 117 counts? Maybe the fair chance
consists of a fair chance with a number of counts or a
number of indictments that one can reasonably expect a
-- a jury to handle without either getting totally
confused or totally exhausted.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, let me -- let me give
two answers to that, Justice Souter. First of all, the
position for which Petitioner argues does not depend on
the number of counts. If there had been two counts in
the indictment --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right, I'm making an
argument that he did not make.
MR. DREEBEN: -- it would be the same.
But more fundamentally, I think that the
number of counts in this indictment should not lead the
Court to think that this was a case in which the
government overcharged in some nefarious effort. First
of all, nefarious efforts like that tend to backfire on
the government, and that's why sound prosecution policy
dictates against overcharging. Here I don't think it's
fair to regard the number of counts as a proxy for
overcharging, and that is because they break up into
logically distinct units.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not, when considering
what the government did on its second chance? It
trimmed 5 -- if there were 20 insider trading, on the
new indictment, there were 5. There were 99 counts of
laundering, which were trimmed to 8, something within
the jury's ken. But isn't the most likely thing in this
case that the jury was simply exhausted?
MR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, Justice
Ginsburg, because all of the insider trading counts turn
on the same fact: did Petitioner have inside
information, did he know that the Enron broadband system
that he was integrally involved in, was the strategic
manager in charge of, wasn't working? If he had that
knowledge and he traded, the number of counts is really
irrelevant, and I think that the fact that the jury
resolved all of the insider trading counts the same way
and the money laundering counts just had to do with the
disposition of the proceeds, they're all resolved the
same way.
The jury obviously deadlocked on whether
some fact that the government needed to prove for those
counts was established. And the bizarre thing, I think,
about Petitioner's position is that he seeks to get
through a legal doctrine, collateral estoppel, which is
a big extension from what the Double Jeopardy Clause
textually prohibits, exactly what the jury would not
give him. The jury --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the -- the
point about the big extension, you were rather coy in
your brief about what you think about Ashe v. Swenson.
Are you asking us to revisit that?
MR. DREEBEN: No, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't
think that the Court needs to revisit Ashe v. Swenson in
order to resolve this case, but I think it's fair to say
that Ashe v. Swenson is a doctrine that transposed
certain civil policies that are -- are expressed through
the doctrine of issue preclusion into the double
jeopardy context in a way that was not supported by the
history of the Fifth Amendment and is not supported by
the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, which requires
the same events.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're not
going to talk about -- you're not going to talk about
the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, are you?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we rely on that
the case is pretty easy, isn't it?
MR. DREEBEN: I think that it is because it
says that the same offense is what you're protected
against for double jeopardy, and the offenses in this
case are distinct under Blockburger. But my point
about --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The person was in
jeopardy on the hung offense as well.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court has made
clear that the jeopardy continues until the government
has the opportunity to obtain a verdict. So the fact
that his jeopardy began is not what entitles him to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under this Court's
decisions, but not under the text of the Double Jeopardy
Clause.
MR. DREEBEN: I think it then becomes a
question of what is the meaning of jeopardy. But
insofar as the Court imported collateral estoppel into
the Double Jeopardy Clause, it should keep in mind in
deciding whether to extend that doctrine that in the
civil context a crucial predicate for collateral
estoppel is the ability of the adversely affected party
to appeal, and that is because before we rely on
collateral estoppel, we want to have some assurances
that there actually is integrity to the necessarily
determined fact that is going to preclude litigation in
another case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the key to your
argument is the government is entitled to one full and
fair opportunity to try its case. It had that
opportunity the first time around.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that this
Court's decisions since --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If there were no separate
counts, that would have been -- that would have been a
fair -- that would be the end of the matter.
MR. DREEBEN: Since 1824 this Court has
defined the government's full and fair opportunity to
include the right to retry if the jury hangs, and here
what the defendant --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it has -- but it has
the right to retry in the same position as it would have
been if it had not brought the first proceeding. And if
it had not brought the first proceeding in this case, it
would have been barred.
MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't -- I don't agree
that it's in the same position --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?
MR. DREEBEN: -- as if it had not bought it.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh.
MR. DREEBEN: It's -- it -- in this case
what the government did was to bring all of its cases
together. And I return to the hypothetical about
Ashe v. Swenson because I think it strikes everyone as
very strange to say that if the jury in Ashe v. Swenson
had been presented with all six robbers and had
acquitted on only one and had a returned -- you know, an
inability to reach a verdict --
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's why we have the
Dunn doctrine, which itself is questionable. It
basically says there is a certain situation in which we
will tolerate what may be an irrational verdict, and the
reason we tolerate it is that the acquittal itself may
be explained on other grounds. Namely --
MR. DREEBEN: I'm not relying on Dunn in
this hypothetical. I'm presupposing that the jury hung
with respect to the other five robbers. And all the
government would come back and say is: For two separate
reasons, we should be able to retry those counts against
the other five robbers. One is that when there is a
hung jury it's settled double jeopardy law that the
government has an opportunity to retry; and the other is
if you accept the proposition that the jury's action was
inconsistent because one of the robbers earned an
acquittal and the other five logically should have been
the same if the jury had found that the defendant wasn't
the robber, the jury was unable to return a verdict.
Collateral estoppel depends on the idea that
there is a rational jury, and if the jury has acted
inconsistently, we don't have that basis of rationality
that supports the policy justifications of collateral
estoppel.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the whole -- whole
doctrine of inconsistent verdicts depends on the
assumption that what appears to be an irrational
inconsistency may have another explanation.
MR. DREEBEN: Yes, such as lenity for the
defendant. The government doesn't get the opportunity
to appeal an acquittal. The government doesn't get the
opportunity to go behind the acquittal and ask whether
the jury acted rationally. All of things -- those
things are true in civil cases where the doctrine of
issue preclusion applies.
JUSTICE BREYER: Start the other side, which
I think Justice Stevens was suggesting. Assume that
there was only one trial on the substantive count in
January. Now each -- he's acquitted. Now you decide to
indict him in July on the telephone count. You argue to
the judge: Judge, there shouldn't be double jeopardy
here because maybe the jury just acquitted him the first
time because they were lenient. Maybe they liked his
looks. Maybe they were distracted by a fly. Maybe they
were, maybe they were -- and we didn't even get an
appeal. Are you going to win that case?
MR. DREEBEN: Not under --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, not even a close.
Okay. Not even close.
Now, since you're going to lose that case, I
grant you there's thousands of case talking about your
ability to bring more cases if you have a hung jury. I
concede all those. None of them talks about double
jeopardy, to my knowledge.
So we're back to the hypothetical. You've
lost your case. Now, all that you did to turn that case
into a winning case was you also indicted him on the
telephone count in January. Now, that was my question
the first time, and you began to have two answers. I
just didn't see why the government should be any better
off because they also indicted him in January. Given
the language "double jeopardy," you might think the
government, if anything, should be worse off, but let's
keep them neutral.
So what is the reason that the government
should be worse off because they indicted him in January
on the telephone count as well as in June?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, the government should
not be worse off.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no -- better. I
misspoke.
MR. DREEBEN: I think the reason is that
when, Justice Breyer, you said double jeopardy is not
involved in the cases involving the government's ability
to retry on a hung count, that's not accurate. The
Court has regarded the doctrine of double jeopardy as a
balance of policies, and one of the fundamental policies
is when the jury cannot agree, the government has the
right to retry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's
right, and your argument depends upon that interest
balancing against the interest in giving effect to the
acquittal verdict.
Now, what if I think, under the Seventh
Amendment that's -- that what is important is protecting
jury verdicts? And the interest in the irrational case,
when you have a conviction and acquittal, is that you
have two jury verdicts and you can't go one way or the
other without undermining one of them. Here, however,
you can give full effect to the verdict of acquittal
without undermining another jury verdict. You certainly
undermine the government's interest in prosecuting after
a hung jury, but if I think what's important under the
Seventh Amendment is the jury verdicts, then the case
comes out the other way, right?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think so, Mr.
Chief Justice, because I think you still have to focus
on the intrinsic character of the doctrine of issue
preclusion, which does depend on a rational jury. Let's
apply it to the facts of this case, because there is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you qualify it in
your statement of the facts. Is there any insider
information with relation to the insider information
charges that is different in any respect from the
insider information in connection with the substantive
challenge?
MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Ginsburg, there is
not. The government's theory here was that on the
substantive securities fraud count, which related to the
January 20th, 2000, analysts meeting, Mr. Yeager was
integrally involved in formulating the message and was
therefore accountable for misstatements to the
marketplace about Enron broadband communications
efficacy and effectiveness and technological value. The
jury, if it rejected that, would acquit on those counts
-- on that count, without reaching the question did Mr.
Yeager know factually that the statements that were made
by others at that analysts conference and in the press
releases subsequently were inaccurate? If the answer to
that question is yes, he had the information, then he
could be liable for insider trading even though he is
not liable for substantive securities fraud because he
had nothing to do with creating the statements or
misstatements to the marketplace.
And I think I do take issue with
Petitioner's suggestion that the theory of this case was
an omissions theory. The way that Mr. Yeager argued the
case to the jury was that I didn't have any involvement
in preparing or making statements at that January 20th
analysts conference; you can't convict me of what other
people may have said. And the jury instructions advised
the jury that it had to find that he participated in the
scheme and that he either made the statements or caused
the statements or omissions to be made. If it rejected
that, it easily acquits on the securities fraud. And as
a result even if this Court were inclined to apply
collateral estoppel across mixed counts in a verdict of
acquittals and hung counts, which we submit it should
not do, the defendant still has to carry his burden of
showing necessarily that the jury resolved an issue of
fact in his favor that would preclude the next
prosecution.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he -- he
carried that burden before the court of appeals.
MR. DREEBEN: But the court of appeals
relied on the view that Mr. Yeager did not contest that
he participated in the planning and preparation and
statements that were made.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Revisiting of that
issue was not included within the question presented.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think it's included in
our ability to defend the judgment. The District Court
in this case made it quite clear that collateral
estoppel did not apply because the acquittals could rest
on the basis that Mr. Yeager did not participate in the
analysts conference and in the press statements that
were the basis for the wire fraud and the securities
fraud omissions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we -- if we
agree with you on that proposition, then the conflict
that we granted cert to resolve would still continue.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, you could resolve it. I
would hope that you would resolve it in a favor of a
disposition that doesn't require you to reach the
factual issue, but if the Court resolves the legal issue
against us, I think it should revisit the analysis of
the court of appeals because government isn't defending
the precise way in which the court of appeals went about
analyzing the double jeopardy issue, and its question of
what facts were necessarily determined was resolved
incorrectly, I think, as a matter of clear error. I
don't even think Mr. Yeager will stand up on rebuttal
and tell you that he didn't argue to the jury that his
client was not involved in -- in the creation of the
statements at that analyst meeting because he did make
that argument.
And I do think that it's important that if
the Court is going to go down a track of allowing
collateral estoppel for mixed verdicts, that it
encourage rigor in the way that courts determine whether
a fact was necessarily decided by the jury.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on that first
theory, and your theory that a retrial on hung counts is
always permitted, I -- I take it there are no court of
appeals opinions or decisions that agree with you on
that point, or am I incorrect?
MR. DREEBEN: They have not reasoned it the
way that the government reasons it, but I think that the
Fifth Circuit's result is equivalent to what the
government argued as well as the D.C. Circuit.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: A different question:
Suppose you prevail. The hung counts are retried. And
the jury hangs again and the jury hangs a second time.
Is there any point at which the district court can
intervene in the exercise of its own authority and
discretion just to dismiss the charges?
MR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, Justice
Kennedy, because I think the interest that's being
vindicated here is a balance of interests, and it's --
as I responded to the Chief Justice and -- and referred
to Justice Souter's question earlier, double jeopardy
has never been a jurisprudence of black and white. You
could you read the clause as saying one trial for a
defendant. If the defendant is -- doesn't get a
conviction at that trial, game over. But the Court has
never done that because the double jeopardy clause has
always involved a balance of the society's very
important interests in having the opportunity for a
decision up or down on whether a defendant is guilty.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then the government can
try year after year to get a conviction and were the
defendant down? Nothing the Court can do so long as
there's a hung jury?
MR. DREEBEN: If the -- if the jury hangs,
the government can retry, and there have been cases
where --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the rule in all of
the States? Don't some States give authority to the
judges to say, enough is enough?
MR. DREEBEN: I am not aware whether any
States do, but certainly as a matter of double jeopardy,
this Court has never suggested that there is. I think
as a matter of common sense, prosecutors who are unable
to achieve a verdict after a certain number of trials do
tend to conclude that it's not in the interest of
society to keep trying. But certainly one hung jury
followed by a retrial is customary rather than an
exception to the rule, and the reason why that's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But one hung jury followed
by a second when there has been an acquittal the first
time around is not customary.
MR. DREEBEN: But the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So the difference is in
the -- in the first trial, you're not impugning the
integrity of the jury's verdict. You're following the
acquittal, and that's true in the compromise cases, the
Dunn case and those cases, but that's not the case here
because you're talking about two different juries.
You're saying the second jury should have an -- an
opportunity to correct what the first jury did, even
though it would not have that opportunity if the first
jury had not faced the issue.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I -- Justice
Stevens, all I can say is that if the first jury had
really believed that Mr. Yeager acted in good faith and
was completely innocent, it should have acquitted on all
counts.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It should have, but it
didn't. We know that. And we just know they did not
reach a conclusion on this issue, but they did reach a
conclusion on the count on which they acquitted.
MR. DREEBEN: We should have -- we should
presume that, as we do in other areas of the law, that
the jury followed the instructions that it was given,
and the instructions that it was given --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you make the same
presumption when there is an inconsistent verdict, but
you say even if it's irrational we'll go along with it
because of the one jury, and they may have had non --
unsound legal reasons for saying, well, we'll let the
guy off on the one count.
MR. DREEBEN: But I think that there is no
reason for the fact that a jury takes irrational action
to then be used for the jury's acquittal to block
complete prosecution.
JUSTICE STEVENS: The jury did not take
irrational action in this case. The only action --
that's relevant was the acquittal. The other they
didn't act.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, they acted irrationally
in the sense that if a fact necessarily determined
acquittals on the -- on the insider trading counts --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It would be irrational if
they had returned a verdict, but they said we can't
agree for who knows why.
MR. DREEBEN: But the point is they should
have agreed logically if they believed that Mr. Yeager
never had inside information or acted in good faith.
And the jury is instructed to consider each count, count
by count, it was given instructions at the Allen phase
of the case that it should strive to achieve a verdict,
that Mr. Yeager is entitled to a verdict of not guilty
if, in fact, the jury believes that he is not guilty and
that it should make every effort to reach the verdict.
Now, the fact that it didn't, and it would
have been very easy for it to do, if it had determined
logically that he did not have inside information, is a
reason for hesitating before extrapolating out from
those acquittals and blocking the government's
opportunity to retry the hung counts.
Mr. Yeager's position logically --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not all that clear,
because as you argue the court -- the district court was
correct in analyzing the -- the estoppel issue. And
it's obviously a very difficult issue because judges
have disagreed about it and the government and your
opponent disagree on it. So, it's entirely possible
that the jury wasn't able to figure it all out.
MR. DREEBEN: I -- I don't think it is that
difficult of an issue. I think the district court which
was closer to it, which had presided over the trial and
which read the closing arguments, made findings that
make it quite clear what Mr. Yeager argued and how those
arguments were totally consistent --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The jury could not have
been as confused as the court of appeals was.
MR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure that --
(Laughter.)
MR. DREEBEN: If the jury was confused and
it acted in an irrational manner, that's a reason not to
apply collateral estoppel, not a reason to do it. What
Mr. Yeager's theory implies is that if the jury had come
back and -- under the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure it can return partial verdicts. If the jury
had come back and said we're struggling on some of the
counts, we have a partial verdict on others of them, and
the judge said, okay, we'll take the partial verdict;
and the jury came in and said, we acquit on five counts,
that Mr. Yeager's theory would be that the judge should
say that's great, collateral estoppel now means you
don't get to finish the deliberations on the counts on
which you said you can't agree. And that result makes
no sense, neither does blocking retrial in this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your theory
depends upon viewing a hung jury as constituting some
action by the jury. Now, obviously it does in some
sense.
But if you view -- if you accept the
proposition that juries only act by returning verdicts,
and that's the reason you can retry, because with a hung
jury the jury hasn't really done anything in the way
jurors act, then the case comes out -- then the
defendant prevails, right?
MR. DREEBEN: I assume I can answer your
question, Mr. Chief Justice?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.
MR. DREEBEN: No, because the -- the logic
of the situation here is that in order for collateral
estoppel to apply, there needs to be a rational jury
verdict. And Ashe versus Swenson tells us that in
attempting to decide what the jury rationally resolved,
we look at all evidence in the record, not just some.
So it isn't necessary to treat the jury's
hung counts as if they are verdicts of a sort. They
simply are data which show that if the jury had been
rational and it had resolved a fact in favor of the
defendant that was necessary for the government to prove
on the other counts, it would have resolved those as
acquittals as well. And once you take into account that
total record, the doctrine of collateral estoppel with
its premise of rationality cannot be applied.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Buffone, you have six minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL J. BUFFONE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BUFFONE: The Solicitor General has
essentially asked this Court to take a metaphysical view
of the Double Jeopardy Clause, but the teachings of this
Court from Sealfon through Ashe is that the important
protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause as applied to
issue preclusion must be approached with reason, with
rationality, with a non-hypertechnical view in order to
protect the public policies that underlie the Double
Jeopardy Clause. And that is quite simply that what
happened here should not occur. That a defendant should
not be forced to relitigate before a second jury an
issue that was necessarily decided.
I sat through and argued through
-and-a-half-week jury trial. A reasonable and
rational explanation of what occurred there is that we
had a conscientious jury that followed its instructions,
that tried to reach through a complex 176-count
indictment, and they simply were not able to. They
spoke the community will, and they spoke it forcefully
in their acquittals. Six of them.
And the only conclusion that can be reached
from those acquittals is that Mr. Yeager did not possess
insider information.
At the beginning of this trial we filed two
motions, the first challenging the specificity of the
indictment, and the second seeking a Bill of
Particulars. The district court answered both with the
same answer. The insider information that Mr. Yeager is
charged with possessing in the insider trader counts is
the false statements made by others at the 2000 Analysts
Conference.
The omissions theory was not as the
Solicitor General submits, some afterthought. It was
core to the government's prosecution and it was core to
the case. The jury decided that the omissions theory
was not a basis to convict on the six counts that it
acquitted. It determined that Mr. Yeager did not
possess that information. And Mr. Yeager is entitled to
the benefits of those acquittals. Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the
