CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 08-351, Alvarez v.
Smith.
Mr. Castiglione.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL CASTIGLIONE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Mr. -- excuse me.
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
Despite the holding in Von Neumann that the
civil forfeiture hearing itself is all the process that
is due for the seizure of personal property, the Seventh
Circuit struck down Illinois's Drug Asset Forfeiture
Procedure Act specifically because it does not require
an additional adversarial hearing that takes place
post-seizure but before the forfeiture hearing.
As far back as this Court's decision in
Gelston v. Hoyt and Slocum v. Mayberry, this Court has
recognized that the civil forfeiture hearing itself is
the single unitary hearing, where all persons having an
interest in the property are present and the following
questions are resolved: One --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any other
area -- is there any other area of law where we permit a
prejudgment attachment and/or seizure of property
without a neutral magistrate reviewing the reason for
that seizure?
We don't permit a pretrial attachment, do
we, except in some narrow circumstances?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Except in some narrow
circumstances, and I note -- and certainly in
garnishment cases and in replevin cases that you would
have to have that type of hearing. But the interests
are different here. The State's interests in the -- in
the seized property takes --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's --
MR. CASTIGLIONE: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't deny that
there's a State interest. The question is who tests
that interest? In what time frame? Meaning you can
assert an interest, but someone has to determine whether
it really exists or not.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Your Honor, historically,
that has always been at the civil forfeiture hearing,
and that's going -- as I say, going back to Gelston,
because what -- what Gelston recognized is that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Castiglione, you have
been asked to address the mootness question -- both
counsel.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have forfeiture
proceedings occurred in the plaintiffs' cases? Is there
any lingering question concerning the status of the
property?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: No -- Your Honor, the
forfeiture cases have concluded, it's true. We --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have concluded?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: They have concluded.
The -- there are three -- three of the Respondents
sought the return of cars. Three had had cash seized.
In the three car cases, the cars had actually been
returned. In two of the cash cases, the Respondents
defaulted, and in one of the cash cases, the -- the
State and the Respondent reached an agreement. So those
cases are over.
But we would submit, Your Honor, that this
case is not moot because, subsequent to the Seventh
Circuit decision in this case, the plaintiffs filed an
amended motion for class certification, and that's at
Docket 49 -- Docket Number 49 of the Northern District
docket, filed on June 19th, 2008, specifically asking
for damages and restitution, in addition to declaratory
and injunctive relief.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, has there ever been a
case in which this Court has considered the merits of a
dispute where the individual claims of the named
plaintiffs expired before we heard argument and a -- and
a class had not yet been certified?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: That’s not the case here,
Your Honor. At least one of the -- one of the
Respondents, a certain Tyhesha Brunston -- her
forfeiture case ended in 2009, so at the time the
amended motion for class certification was filed asking
for damages and restitution.
JUSTICE ALITO: No, but that wasn't my
question. The class has not yet been certified, has it?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: No, it has not, Your
Honor. That’s true.
JUSTICE ALITO: And the -- the claims of all
the named plaintiffs are -- have expired?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, the injunctive
claims may have expired, with the possible exception of
the two Respondents whose -- whose cash cases were
defaulted. But, no, the damage claims, I think were --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There were no damage
claims when the final judgment was entered in the
district court?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: That's correct, Your
Honor.
--
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it was a final
judgment, and it went up on appeal. And at what point
did they seek to -- I mean, while the case was in the
court of appeals, the final judgment dismissing the
case, there was nothing for the district judge to do.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, but after the -- the
Seventh Circuit reversed the district judge's decision
granting the motion to dismiss, upon -- upon remand, the
plaintiffs -- then, at that point, asked for a
certification of the damage class and a restitution
class and expressly stated that they wished to pursue
a claim -- a claim for damages and restitution based on
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't granted then, and
it still hasn't been granted.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: That's true, Your Honor.
And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you have nobody before
this Court with a live claim, neither the original named
plaintiffs nor a certified class.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: I would -- well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So who's here?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: For -- for mootness
purposes, Your Honor, I think the -- the fact that
plaintiffs were allowed to ask for damages and –- and
filed a pleading asking --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They did not ask for
damages originally.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: No, they did not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So as the case comes to
us, we have a district court final judgment dismissing
the case. The case was only for injunctive relief. It
goes to the Seventh Circuit. It's in that shape. We
are taking the case from the Seventh Circuit.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I suppose, if
the case is moot, then you are entitled to a Munsingwear
order.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: I would --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there’s no
controlling authority.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: We would -- that's our
position, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then I suppose
the district court doesn't know whether to award damages
or not until it gets a final decision from -- or a
decision from the Seventh Circuit or this Court.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: That's correct, Your
Honor. I mean, the -- whether or not a damage claim
could go forward would depend on the -- on the validity
of the Seventh Circuit decision.
And our view, Justice Scalia, is that the
-- when -- the -- upon -- even though they did not
formally amend the complaint -- that's true; we
acknowledge that, but in the -- in the motion for
class -- in the amended motion for class cert, I think
the assertion of the claim for damages, at least for
mootness purposes, is enough to give this Court
jurisdiction over -- over those claims.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it been there
originally, but the problem is it wasn't there. The
case comes to us on a complaint that is simply for
injunctive relief. And that is moot.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: That -- with the possible
exception of the two Respondents whose claims defaulted,
Your Honor, in that it's unclear what it -- to the
extent they were seeking the return of their property,
their situation has not changed. Their property never
was returned.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What were they seeking to
have enjoined?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: They were seeking, Your
Honor -- they were asking the court to declare that the
Illinois statute was unconstitutional for not providing
an interim hearing, and an injunction preventing --
preventing Illinois from enforcing the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- I -- since they
defaulted in the -- in the final hearing, how can –- can
they possibly have any claim left with regard to an
interim hearing?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, I just think the
nature of their claim hasn't changed. To the extent
they were seeking the return of their property through
such an injunction, that hasn't changed for those two
plaintiffs, Yunker and Williams. But we rest our -- our
response, Your Honor, and we will --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So am I forgetting, but
didn't this start out as a class action and wasn't the
claim -- wasn't the class action denied?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: It was denied as moot,
that's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you didn't appeal
that?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, we didn't -- we
didn't appeal at all. The plaintiffs appealed the
district court's order, which -- it was a single order
that granted -- I'm sorry -- that granted our motions to
dismiss and denied plaintiffs' motion for class
certification as moot. That was the order.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the plaintiffs -- the
plaintiffs didn't appeal the denial of certification.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: The two -- well, no, Your
Honor, they did not. They appealed the order -- they
appealed the denial of the motion to dismiss -- I'm
sorry -- the granting of the motion to dismiss. Excuse
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe we should --
we should ask the plaintiffs about that. But you're
saying that the two cases that were defaulted are not
moot? Isn't a default the end of it?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: I'm saying they may not be
moot, Your Honor, in that the claim for relief has not
-- and they defaulted before, in at least one of the
cases, before the complaint was even filed. So nothing
has really changed in the status of their case. I
believe Mr. Williams -- nothing has changed in his case
from the time the complaint was filed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said in your opening
that there is just the one proceeding, and that's the
petition for forfeiture. But in your brief you
suggested that there is a means that these plaintiffs
could get back their property pending the ultimate
forfeiture proceeding. You mentioned a Slocum type
hearing, a petition for return of their property. So I
don't understand your argument that there's one and
only procedure, the forfeiture procedure, when on the
other hand you are telling us that there is a means.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, maybe I can explain,
and I think it also goes to the -- what is -- why
the 8,850 -- the use of 8,850 and the Barker speedy
trial factors makes sense. The one hearing where these
issues are resolved is a civil forfeiture hearing, it's
true. But I think what Slocum does, just in a similar
way to how speedy trial factors operate, it gives the
claimant an opportunity to come in and ask the court to
tell the government to fish or cut bait. So you either
file an action or release the property. I think it
operates much the same way that the speedy trial factors
would operate in a criminal case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And they -- and they can do
that before the -- before the time period has expired?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Absolutely, Your Honor.
And they can certainly do that. That's a remedy that's
available up until -- up until the forfeiture case is
filed, and from that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But surely your
position is going to be that the statutory procedure
pre-empts and takes the place of any Slocum hearing,
isn't it? I mean, somebody comes in and files a
petition saying, here I'm raising this right under, you
know, an early 19th century procedure, and you're not
going to say, okay, here's our position or here's the
property. You are going to say, wait until the
forfeiture proceeding that is provided under Illinois
law.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, I -- the –- what
Slocum does, Your Honor, we think -- we believe that
Illinois has recognized for at least over 50 years that
a property owner has a common law right to come in.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But that was before the
statute was enacted.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: That's certainly true,
Your Honor, but that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The statute is a dead
letter if you allow a Slocum action. All you -- all you
need is a Slocum action, and the fact that the statute
says you have to wait for -- you know, that the
government has 40 days, is meaningless.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, Slocum I think is a
way of getting into court, getting the government --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. It's a way of
defeating the statute.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, once -- once the
government does act, Your Honor, then at that point I'd
say if in fact the government's being -- once the
government files a forfeiture action, if the
government's dilatory, there's remedies under – under
Illinois law, our Code of Civil Procedure, or even
perhaps a motion to dismiss for --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the statute says the
government isn't dilatory until -- until the time
period, 40 days. It has 40 days. What does that mean
if it doesn't mean that the government has 40 days?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Oh, the -- I think –- I
think certainly, Your Honor, the government does have
the time periods. Yes, I agree with that. The
government certainly has the time periods. But if the
case were to somehow to fall through the cracks and
nothing would happen, I think what -- what the common
law remedies provide is a safety net for property owners
to be able to get into court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Before the 40 days?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: No, I would say after the
. I would say --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay. Well, that's a
different story. These people are asking for a hearing
before the elapsing of the 40 days, and if all -- if all
you say that Slocum provides is a hearing after the 40
days have elapsed and nothing has occurred, that doesn't
satisfy what they are asking for.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, I would say Slocum
provides a hearing after 40 days, Your Honor. I would
say, if the government does nothing, it's a way of
getting into court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't have to do
anything for 40 days, is what the statute says.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: And we don't dispute that.
And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say if it -- you
don't dispute that doesn't have to do anything, but you
-- you assert that if it does nothing, you can bring a
Slocum action. I mean, which is it? One or the other?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, Slocum is an
equitable remedy. If someone can establish -- I don't
think before the time has run out in our procedures one
could probably establish that, but it's possible if a
case were to -- were to fall through the cracks, and it
gives --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Slocum then is the
answer to a very different case. It's a case where
you have a class action of people whose cases fell
through the cracks and never got the procedures they
were entitled to. It doesn't seem at all responsive to
the claim that they are entitled to procedures before it
falls through the cracks.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, our position, Your
Honor, is that the -- the statute -- is the regime that
Illinois has adopted with the time periods, does –- does
comply with due process. It provides a way of dealing
with some number of the issues Respondents have raised.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't the basic
argument that you make that a forfeiture hearing is all
the process that is due?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, let me ask you this
question: Suppose your statute said there shall be a
forfeiture hearing with all the procedures you want, but
the forfeiture hearing shall take place 1 year after the
seizure. Would that be adequate?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Under this Court's view --
decision in FDIC v. Mallen, I don't think you would look
to the outer limits, Your Honor. But I think --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, I'm saying the
minimum. The hearing will take place 1 year after the
seizure, nothing earlier or nothing later. Would that
be constitutional?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Again, applying -- well,
if it is possible for the States to do it in a shorter
fashion --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Clearly, it's possible to
do it in less than a year.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: And if a State -- if a
State's practice were to do so, but I would say --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, there is no
practice, no background practice. This is a new
statute. So this -- you have to have a forfeiture
hearing, as you describe it, that shall take place 6
months --
MR. CASTIGLIONE: One year later.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- or a year later. Would
that be constitutional?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, that's shorter than
the time period that this Court found complied with due
process in 8,850 --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand what
the Court has held. I'm asking your view of that
hypothetical statute.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: I think -- I think --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And if you agree that it's
unconstitutional, then you have to agree that time is –-
is relevant to the question whether the forfeiture
hearing --
MR. CASTIGLIONE: I would not agree –- I
would not agree that it's unconstitutional.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So you would then say it
would be constitutional to say one hearing 1 year later?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: I think facially it is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ten years?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, I think, again, I’d
go back to FDIC v. --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ten years?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, no, I would say 10
years without any judicial intervention --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You’ve -- you’ve given up
the position, then. You've said time does matter. So
we are just arguing over what the time is, whether it's
years, 1 year, or 40 days, right?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, 40 days I think is
consistent, is I think a reasonable --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It may be, but that's a
different argument. It's -- it's not an absolute.
It's -- we have to consider whether the time period is
reasonable, right?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: If -- if -- I would say
this: If the statute said you can't come in –- the
State said you can't proceed for 10 years and no one has
any -- property owner or interest owner has no way of
going into court, that probably would be --
JUSTICE ALITO: I ask you this about the
government's interest involved here and the practicality
of the situation, and I want to put aside the innocent
owner defense, which I hope to ask your adversary about.
But putting that aside, let's take what I envision as
sort of the typical case where the police officer
arrests someone in a vehicle for a drug offense and --
without a warrant -- and then has to file a complaint in
court.
What -- what is the government -- what is
the burden on the government, and what would be the
burden on Chicago or the State of Illinois in a
requirement that within some reasonably brief period of
time after that that there must be the equivalent of the
filing of a complaint in court, just as you would for
the arrest of an individual without a warrant, where the
only issue would be whether there was probable cause for
the seizure, not whether there, you know, is some
innocent owner defense, but just whether there’s
probable cause?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: I think there are several
burdens. One, I think that hearing would be duplicative
of the ultimate forfeiture hearing. I think if it's an
adversarial hearing, it might be a way of doing, like, a
-- like, almost back door discovery in the -- in the
attendant criminal case if we had to do an adversarial
hearing in a civil forfeiture case. I think it
disregards the State's interest, Your Honor, in -- in
promoting informal negotiation and settlement. And
that's something I had hoped to talk about.
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, he was just talking
about probable cause. How could that be duplicative?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, just something along
the line --
JUSTICE BREYER: Look, I thought this case,
though I grant you I could well be wrong, is not about a
final forfeiture hearing where you have to show that
it's more probable than not that the car was used for
drugs. But under the Illinois law, just as Justice
Alito said, you can seize a car without a warrant.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: And there are lists of
circumstances. But in the Florida statute that Justice
Thomas wrote about, it said that a person whose car it
is, is entitled to a hearing, I thought, in a brief time
to see if there was probable cause, just as a person
arrested. You have to bring them before a magistrate
within a short time to see if there's probable cause.
Now, how do you do that in Chicago?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, first of all,
Justice Breyer, we say the complete deprivation of one's
liberty is not the same as the deprivation of property.
The way we do it under our statute -- the way we deal
with this issue is there’s -- the statutory regime
really has two concepts, one for property, seized
property, that -- whose value exceeds 20,000, and one
where --
JUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying the answer
to the question is there is no way? A person who doubts
this probable cause has no way. He has to wait 6 months
until there's a forfeiture hearing. He's out of luck
because then it merges with the merits.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: It does merge with the
merits. That's historically --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. That’s your answer.
There is no way.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, there’s still a –-
JUSTICE BREYER: Then I don't see why you
win this case.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: -- there’s no formal
hearing.
JUSTICE BREYER: What?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: I'm sorry, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, is there a way or
not? You have pointed to three statutes. Do they give
him any way?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Those statutes are a way
to getting into -- to getting into court --
JUSTICE BREYER: Look --
MR. CASTIGLIONE: -- to expedite the
hearing. And once the hearing is filed, Your Honor, it
is certainly possible to -- you know, to move to
expedite the trial.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you get an
expedited hearing? I thought -- I thought for property
under 20,000, the State -- the time before the
forfeiture proceeding could be 187 days.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Forty-five of those days,
Your Honor, is what would be the property owner deciding
whether to file a claim. And if -- I mean, one of the
possibilities -- it’s at section 6 of our statute, which
is actually nonjudicial in rem forfeitures. If one were
to simply file -- a property owner simply file a claim
but not a cash bond, then there wouldn't be a judicial
proceeding. It would just be informal negotiations with
the State's attorney. One could always go to court by
filing a cash bond.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the bond is for
costs, not to get your car back.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: The bond is for costs,
right. But the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any
procedure for putting up a bond for the car so you can
get the car back, for the full value of the car?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: There isn't, Your Honor.
I would briefly address that. I know I have 1 minute
remaining. I would like to -- to reserve the time for
rebuttal. I would like to answer this question.
No, Your Honor. For bond, about 80 to 85
percent of our cases are cash, seizures of cash, and as
the Seventh Circuit recognized, posting a cash bond for
cash is an absurdity.
With respect to cars, Your Honor, the
problem is the State's duty is to be able to preserve
and prevent the destruction or dissipation of the
property prior to the forfeiture hearing. If we bond it
out, we can't guarantee that at the ultimate forfeiture
hearing, that property would be -- would be preserved.
Your Honor, I would like -- if I may, I
would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will afford you
additional time because the Court's questions have
intruded upon your rebuttal time.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Jay.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I would like to begin, if I may, with the
colloquy that Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia had
with my co-counsel about the hypothetical where the
State mandates a minimum time --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would think
you’d begin with the mootness question.
MR. JAY: I would be happy to begin with the
mootness question, Your Honor. And I -- although I
think that it's, to some degree, a question for the
Respondents what precisely they are seeking. Because
there are two Respondents, Yunker and Williams, who have
lost their property. The property is in the possession
of the State. And if their position is that unless a
hearing is held within 10 days, which is what they
originally asked for in their complaint, a probable
cause hearing within 10 days, if after that no
forfeiture is possible because timely post-deprivation
process has not been afforded, if that’s their claim,
then it appears their claim is still alive because the
State still has their property.
If, however, their claim expires when the
forfeiture proceeding is actually held, then that
proceeding is over and we agree that their injunctive
claims are moot.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what were they
seeking to enjoin?
MR. JAY: It's not entirely clear from their
complaint, Your Honor. They were -- they were asking
for the imposition of this 10-day hearing requirement,
but it -- and they are -- they were contending -- now,
each of these was filed after the 10 days had run. The
most recent seizure had occurred 2 months before the
class action complaint was filed in district court.
So it appears they were contending that they
wanted the forfeiture proceeding stopped because a
hearing had not been held within 10 days. So the
complaint doesn't make perfectly clear what kind of
injunction they were seeking except that they wanted the
imposition of this 10-day procedure.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What did the Illinois
court do? Didn't it remand for an appropriate hearing
to be given?
MR. JAY: Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit
remanded for the district court to fashion -- to fashion
some kind of procedure, that's right. And after that
remand order the plaintiffs, interpreting what the
Seventh Circuit had said, filed the amended motion for
class certification that Mr. Castiglione referred to,
and in that they said they wanted a class certified to
pursue damages for the time that their property was
detained, and they wanted the court to certify a class
of anyone who had had their property held for more than
days this time without -- without a proper hearing.
JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right that what is –-
what is the rationale your supporting it for the
following: My car was parked on the street. There
happened to be some big drug crime nearby, and the
policeman took my car. In my opinion, there was no
probable cause. I would like my car back.
Now, I take it that in Illinois there is no
proceeding, as there was in Florida, so that I can claim
there was no probable cause, and I -- none at all. I
never get that determination made; and, moreover, I have
to wait, for 6 months possibly, before I get a different
determination made, which is whether they had –- more
likely than not, whether that's entitled to forfeiture
on the merit.
Is that the law? If anything like it is the
law, what’s the constitutional justification for it?
MR. JAY: Well, let me begin, Your Honor, by
pointing out that it's not the law, because the State's
ultimate burden at the hearing is not preponderance of
the evidence; it's probable cause. It's -- it's
precisely the same burden that --
JUSTICE BREYER: You mean they can keep my
car even if it's more likely than not that it was never
involved?
MR. JAY: When the -- when the State shows
probable cause, the burden shifts to the claimant to
prove by a preponderance -- so the ultimate burden is by
a preponderance.
JUSTICE BREYER: But it's still -- okay,
fine.
MR. JAY: But it’s --
JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. That is – all
right. That's a burden of proof thing at the final
thing. That's not the thrust of my question.
The thrust of my question is: Do I have to
wait for up to 6 months before I have any magistrate,
any neutral official, pass on my claim there was no
probable cause to take my car?
MR. JAY: And, Justice Breyer, you –-
JUSTICE BREYER: And the Florida statute, by
the way, doesn't do that. It says of course you get a
hearing on probable cause.
MR. JAY: The Florida statute --
JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right?
MR. JAY: The Florida statute -- you are
correct -- unique as far as I know among all the
statutes legislated by the 50 States that use asset
forfeiture or the Federal Government, does provide an
adversarial probable cause hearing within the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So nobody gives you
-- they go around taking cars even without probable
cause. There’s no way to do -- it happens in every
State.
What’s the constitutional justification for
making a person wait for 6 months before he gets a
neutral judicial official to say whether there was even
cause to take his car?
MR. JAY: The constitutional justification,
Justice Breyer, requires that a reviewing court look at
each step in the process, and it's not just a matter of
months from beginning to end. That process in
Illinois and in many other systems has different steps.
The first step is investigation and notice.
The -- and then the second step is deciding whether to
pursue this. The third step is completely in the hands
of the claimant, where the claimant decides whether to
pursue a judicial hearing. And the fourth --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You take the
car and then you investigate?
MR. JAY: Your Honor, there’s more to
investigate than just the probable cause to seize. In
many cases, the probable cause to believe the car is
forfeitable is ironclad, but there is more to
investigate because, for example, an innocent owner in
Illinois by statute is entitled not to have her car or
her gun or her personal -- other personal property -- it
could be currency -- forfeited. And that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but you are –-
but you’re sort of begging the question. You are saying
to me that initial period is for the government to
figure out if it made a mistake or not, and we're
entitled to that time. You're not entitled, meaning
you, property owner, to go to a neutral magistrate who
will make that decision without a personal interest in
the outcome, because the person who seized does have an
interest of some sort. Many local police departments do
in seizing property, because they keep the proceeds.
So what you're saying is that
constitutionally it's okay for the party holding on to
property without a warrant to decide whether or not it
wants to give something back, whether or not there’s
-- there’s a viable defense. I'm a little confused.
MR. JAY: Let me respond to that in a couple
of steps. And the first is to respond to your point
about the incentives that local police departments may
face. There is no incentive to -- to hold property
longer than necessary because, while the property is
being held, there is no ability to access that property.
If it's currency, for example -- as Mr. Castiglione
pointed out, 85 percent of their seizures are -- the
currency is held in a suspense account and is not
accessible by the -- by the seizing government at all.
So the government has no interest in delaying longer
than necessary, especially for cars. The government has
to take care of the car, maintain it in a lot, you know,
preserve it from -- from harm.
Second, on the basic question of what is the
government doing during this time? The government has a
due process obligation, especially in an in rem
proceeding like this one, which deals with a piece of
property to which there may be competing claims. The
government has a -- itself has a due process obligation
to notify everyone who has a claim to this property that
it’s in the government's custody and that there will be
a proceeding to adjudicate the competing claims to it.
I mean, this Court in Robinson v. Hanrahan,
a decision in 1972, held that Illinois under its
forfeiture statute had violated due process by not
providing notice to the owner -- to the registered owner
of a car, because it sent notice to that owner at his
address when in fact he was in the custody of the State
of Illinois in a criminal proceeding.
The State has an obligation to notify -- to
investigate, especially after a seizure, even if it is a
car which only a minority of seizures are -- even if it
is a car. Identifying the driver is not enough to
identify who has a claim to that car. There may be a
registered owner. There may be -- there may be a
security interest. In currency cases, it's even more
difficult, because on the face of currency there is no
indication who owns the currency --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just get you to
answer what I thought you were going to do at the
beginning of the argument. How do you answer my
hypothetical? You have a forfeiture hearing, but you
have a provision that it shall not take place for 6
months.
MR. JAY: And that, of course, as I think
the hypothetical recognizes, Justice Stevens, is
different from a statute like we have here where there’s
a maximum time, but it may well take place within --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand it's
different. I’m just curious to know what your answer
MR. JAY: My answer, Justice Stevens, is
that it might well be unconstitutional as applied. And
the Court, in 8,850, says --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't it be
unconstitutional on its face?
MR. JAY: It wouldn't be unconstitutional on
its face, Justice Stevens, because sometimes the State
has a valid interest in holding property for more than a
year, as Mr. Castiglione said. In 8,850 itself, the
property was held for 18 months. The Court has said in
any due process case --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would that justify a
statute that says in all cases it shall be held for at
least 18 months without telling the owner?
MR. JAY: I think, Your Honor, that if the
State responded to an 8,850 defense and said -- and said
nothing other than the statute says 18 months or
years, and -- you know, and we have done nothing
during that time, I think that it would be
unconstitutional as applied.
But as a practical matter, States and the
Federal Government are not sitting around doing nothing
after seizing property. They are actively investigating
who has a claim, they are notifying all claimants, they
are allowing -- allowing those claimants to file claims
if they wish. A majority of all seizures are
uncontested.
And then whenever a claimant wants one, that
claimant is entitled to an in rem judicial hearing,
where all -- all claimants come into court and have --
have the government's right to seize the property
adjudicated and also the affirmative defenses, such as
the innocent owner defense. Now --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose a situation in
which the property taken is really essential to the --
to the living of the person from whom -- who owns it --
a car -- and the person needs a car to get to work every
day. And -- and there is really no reason why the --
why the government has to wait that long.
Is there no procedure by which he can say,
you know -- do it quickly. You don't have to wait so
long. I'm the owner. I'm the only owner. I can -- I
can prove that. Let's have a quick hearing.
MR. JAY: I think that as the Federal
framework reflects, that is the kind of situation that
is -- that can be addressed by legislation. And the
Federal hardship provision, 18 U.S.C. 983(f), is a good
way of illustrating that; that the government has
competing interests in all these cases that compete with
the claimants’ interests and in cases such as currency,
where the government can't be secured against the
possibility that the property will disappear, then --
then there’s no hardship exception. And -- but the
government -- Congress, after extensive study, has
made a hardship provision for other forms of personal
property.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no -- there’s
no hardship under the Illinois statute? There is no
provision comparable to the Federal legislation for
hardship, is there?
MR. JAY: You are correct, Justice Ginsburg,
that there is no statutory provision, no.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Peters.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS PETERS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PETERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This case is not moot. It's not moot
because at the time that the plaintiffs filed the case
they clearly had standing. They immediately moved for
class certification. And although their motion for
class certification was denied, it was denied because
the merits of the case were simultaneously denied. And,
in fact, this Court has addressed a situation remarkably
similar to this in United States Parole Commission v.
Geraghty.
In the Geraghty case, the class was not
certified. It was denied, as it was here. The case
became moot because the plaintiff in that case was a
Federal prisoner, had been released on parole, and
nonetheless the Court allowed the case to proceed. And
the reason the Court allowed the case to proceed, as I
understand it, is that the "capable of repetition, yet
evading review" doctrine was invoked. Once that
document is invoked, the claim -- the standing relates
back to the time of the filing of the complaint. At the
time of the filing of the complaint, there was standing,
and the putative class --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say it was likely
to -- these same named plaintiffs were likely –- likely
-- to face this same situation again?
MR. PETERS: No, that's not what I'm saying,
Your Honor. What I'm suggesting –-
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if you are relying
on -- on, you know, "capable of repetition, yet evading
review," that's -- that's the test, whether -- whether
indeed these people stand a chance of having the same
thing happen.
MR. PETERS: I respectfully beg to differ,
Your Honor. With respect to class actions and cases
where the plaintiff has timely requested to certify a
class, the "capable of repetition" relates to the class.
There is right now today a class of people in the city
of Chicago who have their cars impounded. That -- their
claims are repeating daily.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You are begging the
question. That is, you are assuming that the class is a
valid class. It hasn't been certified. How -- how can
you make that -- that argument when there is no class?
MR. PETERS: Well, I -- I can make that
argument --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Just an asserted class on
your part. There’s no class.
MR. PETERS: Yes, and that was also true in
Geraghty, Your Honor. There were -- the motion for
class --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, it wasn't. The
appeal in Geraghty included an appeal of the denial of
class certification.
MR. PETERS: Yes, it did, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So both issues – both
the merits and the denial of the class certification –-
were still active before the Court. Here you didn't
appeal the dismissal of the class certification or the
mootness of it.
MR. PETERS: Well, we couldn't, Your Honor,
because it was inextricably linked to the merits. In
Geraghty --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but in many
appeals parties plead in the alternative and say, if you
-- if we win on the merits, reverse the dismissal of the
class certification because we still want to proceed as
a class. You didn't do that. You waited for the merits
to be adjudicated and then filed a new class action.
It's a very different procedural step.
MR. PETERS: I don't think that it is
significantly different when one considers the concerns
that animated the Court's decision in Geraghty. The
concerns that were at issue in that case were the fact
that the plaintiff was representing a class that was
going to continue to exist and that as to that class
there was constantly going to be a claim repeating; and
that that person, even though the class was denied -- in
that case it truly -- it was denied on the merits,
because he had an opportunity to litigate the merits.
We did not have a -- opportunity to litigate the merits
of the Rule 23 issue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Peters, I think the
Court in Geraghty said it split the interests. And they
said his interests in challenging the denial of class
action status continued even though he was no longer
incarcerated.
So they were concentrating on his right to
appeal the denial of class action certification. And
that's what you don't have here. And that’s what
distinguishes this case from Geraghty.
MR. PETERS: I -- I certainly agree that it
is not an identical situation, Your Honor. But I
think -- as I said before, I think again that the
concerns that caused the Court to reach that position in
Geraghty are in fact the same because in this case
the -- there is a continuing activity with respect to
the class. There is some -- there are a group of people
who are aggressively pursuing the rights of that class.
There is a live controversy between the government and
that class.
So in all of those respects, which are
similar to what --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we must take it as it
came into the Seventh Circuit, which is no appeal from
the denial of class certification. So we have
individual plaintiffs who are seeking to overturn the
denial of injunctive relief. And that's all that's
before the Seventh Circuit.
MR. PETERS: That was -- that was all that
was before the Seventh Circuit because I don't -- it
seems to me that it is just sort of a gratuitous gesture
to say, I am appealing the denial of the class
certification ruling, when the class certification
ruling is itself based entirely on the denial of the
merits.
If there had not -- if there had been any
inkling, any ruling that suggested that the Rule 23
aspect, the class aspect, was being denied on
class-related grounds, then of course there would be an
appeal. But what --
JUSTICE SCALIA: As it turns out it -- it
wouldn't have been gratuitous.
(Laughter.)
MR. PETERS: Well -- I understand Your
Honor's position, although I --
JUSTICE BREYER: But if I have a different
position, which is I’d like to see if it's practical
to decide this case now, two things stand in the way in
my mind which I’d like you to address. The first
is your opponents are saying, no, you shouldn't really
address this issue now because there are three Illinois
statutes which actually give them, anyone who wants it,
a right to a hearing at least on probable cause. And
that's a matter of Illinois law. And although the
statutes don't seem to say it, they might.
And the second is that this seems mixed up
in my mind -- not necessarily your fault; it may be my
mind -- but it seems to me there are two quite separate
questions: when you are entitled to a final hearing of
whether forfeiture is right or wrong; and whether you
are entitled to a preliminary hearing on whether there
was probable cause under the statute to obtain the car.
Now, that latter question I think might be
impractical in many cases to work out until there's been
a trial of an individual who's accused of a crime, which
may be much later.
But the former question is where I think you
have a point, that there are five instances here in this
statute where a policeman could seize a car without a
warrant and he has to have probable cause under most of
them nonetheless. So your clients might say: He did
not have probable cause; I want a neutral magistrate to
contest it.
Now, in my mind that reaches -- that's a
different question than the final hearing about who's
entitled to the car. And I also see the three statutes
and now I see a case where here in front of me
everything is mixed up. So I think -- perhaps I'm just
seeing it that way, but those issues are mixed up
confused and not separated out. So why don't we
wait? What's your answer now?
MR. PETERS: I think that -- that waiting
would be the prudent thing to do. And it's
unquestionably true that what we're suggesting with
respect to the preliminary hearing is not identical to
the final hearing. The final hearing is -- is on the
merits. It decides where the property is going to,
finally and ultimately. The hearing we are talking
about is a conditional release hearing, similar to what
happens in Krimstock, similar to what happens under the
Civil Asset Forfeiture Review Act.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but then if
it's -- if it's money that is being conditionally
released, there’s no security for the government. If
it turns out later on it shouldn't have been released,
it's probably gone.
MR. PETERS: Well, there -- there could be
grounds for -- there could be ways of getting security
for it. I mean, perhaps a person would post some other
collateral because they desperately needed the cash at
that moment. I certainly agree with Your Honor that the
bond procedure is much more in tune with and much more
likely to work with cars than with other property.
JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you --
MR. PETERS: Sure.
JUSTICE ALITO: -- exactly what you think
needs to take place at this hearing? And the hearing
you think has to take place within 10 days? Is that
your figure?
MR. PETERS: No, Your Honor. In the
complaint we did reference 10 days, and the reason we
did that is because we thought that that was an
appropriate time frame.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, whatever the period
is: 10 days, 14 days, whatever. Some short period.
MR. PETERS: Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO: I have two questions: Must
it be an adversarial hearing, and must the State
disprove the innocent owner defense?
MR. PETERS: No and no. I think that
the -- with respect to whether it's an adversarial
hearing, I -- what we envision is a hearing similar to
what happens in Krimstock where basically the
government's burden is met by having police reports
which on their face establish probable cause to at least
seize the car.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, but my understanding
of Krimstock is that a lot of those seizures –- and
others know more about this than I do -- were for DWI,
and that it is possible to assert an innocent owner
defense there. And that's where I see a great
impracticality in this. I -- I don't see how you can
expect the State to come into court within such a short
period and have any burden of contesting an innocent
owner defense without compromising a criminal
investigation.
MR. PETERS: Well, if there was -- my answer
to that, I think, Your Honor, is in two parts: One is
the Federal Government is already doing something like
that with the CAFRA. There are hardship provisions, and
part of the hearing could include showing by the car
owner or the property owner that they are in fact likely
to prevail as an innocent owner. Now --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that -- I
thought the government said it doesn't apply to cash.
So that -- which we are told is 85 percent of the
seizures involved.
MR. PETERS: The CAFRA doesn't apply to
cash. That’s true.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you this
example which is pretty much based on something that you
–- you wrote in your own brief. Joe is arrested on a
drug offense driving a car, and there are drugs in the
car. But Joe isn't the owner of the car; John is the
owner of the car. Then John comes in 10 days later or
days later and says, well, you know, I never had any
inkling that Joe was using the car to deal in drugs and
had no reason to know that. And you think that within
that short period of time the State has to disprove
that, you know, that John didn't have --
MR. PETERS: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO: -- reason to believe that
Joe was involved in drug dealing?
MR. PETERS: No, Your Honor. I think the
burden will be on the property owner to establish first
that that the person is the owner of the property, and
second to establish to some yet-undefined degree that
they have a likely innocent owner defense.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said -- I
thought you said the innocent owner defense didn't have
to be inquired into in the probable cause here. I
thought that was your position.
MR. PETERS: It -- it is not ordered
by the Seventh Circuit but I -- we would believe that an
innocent owner --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, you want –-
MR. PETERS: -- argument should be included,
and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. That makes it
harder. You’re challenging this -- this statute on its
face, isn't that right?
MR. PETERS: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No?
MR. PETERS: As applied.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Just as applied?
MR. PETERS: Yes, we made that clear in the
complaint. There has never been any argument --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, how can you have an --
MR. PETERS: -- to the contrary until this
Court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you have an
as-applied challenge to an entire class?
MR. PETERS: Well, first of all, Your Honor,
what we're suggesting, the order of the Seventh Circuit
does not invalidate any provision of this Act and in
fact it's entirely consistent with section 2 of the
Act, which incorporates by reference Federal remedies
which include interim remedies. So it is not how the
Act on its face is written. It’s how it is being
applied to these people. And in addition to that, we
are not suggesting that every --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why -- to -- to have
an as-applied challenge, regardless of whether the
Illinois law provides a -- a remedy, wouldn't you be
able to individually assert under section 1983
unconstitutional action?
I mean, isn't there a Federal remedy? If
all you're concerned about is as-applied, you mean you
are being treated unconstitutionally by a State and you
have no remedy?
MR. PETERS: There is a Federal remedy, Your
Honor, but that is not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that enough?
MR. PETERS: That’s -- that’s certainly not
enough, Your Honor, for the following reason: It is
largely impractical for most people -- many of the
people who are involved in drug forfeiture seizures are
people with modest to low incomes, probably little to no
access to attorneys. The likelihood of them
understanding, first of all, that they may have this
right, then contacting an attorney and getting an
attorney to litigate --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But they will know about
the probable cause hearing that you want to -- that you
want set up, right?
MR. PETERS: If -- this is why it should be
a class, and it clearly applies to a large class of
people.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- which is why you
are asking for a facial challenge. You want these
hearings in all cases --
MR. PETERS: No, Your --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- regardless of what the
individual circumstances are; isn't that so?
MR. PETERS: No, that is not so.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It is not so?
MR. PETERS: Yes, and the reason is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what are the
individual circumstances of all the other people in
the class? We don't know what they are. We don't know
whether it's a car that has been taken, money that has
been taken, whether they are millionaires, whether they
need the car. We know nothing about them.
MR. PETERS: That's correct, Your Honor.
But that's a function of the fact that this case came to
the Court without the benefit of discovery, without
having an opportunity to identify.
But what I was -- what I would suggest to
Your Honor is this: We are not suggesting that every
single person who has a piece of property taken is
necessarily entitled to this hearing. If, for example,
the police seize my favorite baseball card, I would not
be entitled to a hearing under the Mathews criteria
because my favorite baseball card does not justify
putting the government through the expense. On the
other hand, there are categories of people -- say they
seized $5,000. There is some limit below which the
hearings may not apply. But if all --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what
if at your innocent owner or the hearing that you are
seeking, you establish, well, I was going to sell my
baseball card to give me the money to -- to survive, to
get food?
That was my -- I mean, what happens then?
MR. PETERS: There would have to be -- first
of all, we don't know how that would administratively be
handled because of the posture of the case, but my
suggestion, Mr. Chief Justice, would be this: That the
likely result in a case -- in this case, is that there
should be hearings for all car owners and that there
should be a baseline dollar value below which a person
is not entitled to a hearing. Now, how that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So just to get back
to the cars, I thought your answer to Justice Alito was
a little abstract. In the absolute concrete case, where
the drug -- the suspect is driving the car, there are
drugs in the car.
MR. PETERS: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At your hearing, the
-- it's not registered to him. The registered owner
comes in and says, that's my car, I had no idea it was
being used for drugs.
Who wins, the State or the registered owner?
MR. PETERS: Well, in -- in those
circumstances and that's the only car, I would say,
most likely, the property should be returned to the car
owner.
However, I would add that, if the government
has some concerns about -- for example, that they need
additional time to investigate this innocent owner
claim, then by having the hearing in front of a neutral
and detached person --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, aren't they
always going to say that? They are going to say, well,
we don't know if the registered owner is involved in the
drug conspiracy. We don't know how closely he is tied
with the owner, so it's reasonable to assume he knew
what was going on, and besides, we’ve got a lot of other
bigger fish to fry during this period.
We are trying to find out the scope of the
conspiracy. We are trying to find out where the sales
were going to take place. Why do you force us to -- to
focus our energies on the relationship between a
registered owner and the guy driving the car?
MR. PETERS: Well, I don't think that that
is likely to happen, and I think what’s going on in New
York is proof that that is not how it works out, and I
think --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the situation is much
worse than that, that they don't have the -- that they
need time to investigate. They may have the registered
owner under investigation.
They may think he is involved in the drug
conspiracy as well. They may have him on wiretaps.
They may be preparing to arrest him. Now, you want to
force them to come into court within 10 or 14 days and
disclose the details of a -- of a pending criminal
investigation and prepare to -- that makes a great --
MR. PETERS: No, Your Honor. I'm not
suggesting that at all.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, then I don't
understand how this -- how you can possibly have the
innocent owner issue adjudicated at this quick hearing.
I can understand the argument that you have
to have the filing of the equivalent of a -- of a
complaint when you -- that has to be filed when someone
is arrested without a warrant, where it's not
adversarial and you establish probable cause for the
seizure.
But when you start to go beyond that in drug
forfeiture cases, at least, not -- not DWI cases, I just
don't see how that's workable.
MR. PETERS: Well, except --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can you
unpackage for me this hearing? Because there is a
confusion in it that appears, both in your papers and in
this argument.
There’s a probable cause component, which
is the police coming before a neutral magistrate and
saying, this is the reason I seized; I have probable
cause to believe that this car was involved in an
illegal activity, and this is why.
And then there is what sounds like, to me, a
sort of remission-type component to the hearing you are
looking at, which is a magistrate saying, okay, you have
probable cause, but there's no reason for the seizing
authorities to keep the car because you can post a bond
instead, or something else should be done to mitigate
the damage to you during this process of forfeiture.
Am I correct that there are two components
to your request? And if there are, I understand the
probable cause component, but I'm not sure how you get
to the second component of how and why due process would
require the State to have a -- I'm calling it
remission -- but a remission-like proceeding?
Am I correct? Am I understanding what –-
what it is you're --
MR. PETERS: Yes, Your Honor, but let me go
back in response to your question and, I think, in
part to Justice Alito's.
The Seventh Circuit hasn't ordered any
specific hearing, so I am, at this point, advising the
Court of what I think this hearing should look like.
It could well be, upon remand and discovery,
that what I am suggesting the -- the hearing should look
like, it may -- it may not look like that at all. It
could be that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that one of the
problems with the Seventh Circuit decision? That it
covers the waterfront. It covers cash, as well as any
property. It’s not concentrated on cars.
And what your complaint asks for -- you said
it was as applied, but you are asking for a declaration
that defendants must hold a post-seizure probable cause
hearing within 10 business days, and you are asking the
Court to enjoin the defendant’s current practice of
seizing property and retaining custody without a
judicial determination of probable cause.
That sounds, to me, like a facial challenge
to this statute, and you are asking for a declaration
that the statute is invalid, not as applied to any
particular person.
MR. PETERS: I think it's invalid as applied
to categories of people, but I would continue to
maintain --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think -- you think it's
unconstitutional as applied to everybody who is not
given this -- this preliminary hearing. That's --
that's what the complaint says.
Your -- the class you want certified is the
class of everybody who has not been given a preliminary
hearing. I don't know the difference between that and
saying that this statute is unconstitutional as
applied.
MR. PETERS: On that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, just –- just
because you don't say in your complaint, this is a
facial challenge, it amounts to a facial challenge. You
say, everybody who has not been given a preliminary
hearing is entitled to relief because the statute is bad
as to all of them.
MR. PETERS: The Seventh Circuit, however,
did not endorse completely what we alleged in the
complaint. We, of course, in the complaint, like most
complaints, ask for as much as you think you might be
able to get.
But the Seventh Circuit did not order
hearings across the board for every single person whose
property is taken. And I'm not suggesting that every
single person whose property is taken will necessarily
be entitled to a hearing.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, can we --
MR. PETERS: There are --
JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish.
MR. PETERS: There are going to be
circumstances when the value of the property is de
minimis as compared to the cost of the hearing. And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That is not the class you
asked to be certified. You asked to certify everybody
who had been denied a preliminary hearing.
MR. PETERS: Yes, I -- I did, Your Honor,
and in that regard, I was mistaken, but the Seventh
Circuit corrected my mistake and only ordered a remand
for a determination as to who it would be, who would be
entitled to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where does the
Seventh Circuit --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't change this --
this action from a class action -- from a facial
challenge into a nonfacial challenge. They can't change
your complaint.
You were either asking this to be struck
down on its face, or you weren't. And what -- what the
Seventh Circuit did doesn't change that.
MR. PETERS: Well, Your Honor, I think what
the Seventh Circuit did does change it because now the
ruling is what was determined by the Seventh Circuit,
and the Seventh Circuit did not say that every single
person is entitled to a hearing.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, can I get to the
merits for a second?
MR. PETERS: Yes, sir.
JUSTICE BREYER: Go back to what Justice
Alito and Justice Sotomayor were asking. This
statute gives a policeman the right to seize some
property without a warrant if it's a circumstance where
you could seize a person without a warrant.
That’s basically what it says, doesn't it?
MR. PETERS: Yes.
--
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. In that kind of
situation, I would think maybe you are entitled to a
quick hearing where the only subject would be: Was that
language carried out? Was that policeman right? Was
there probable cause, or wasn't there?
Now, if that's the issue, I don't see why
you give up at all on the baseball card. I mean, if
somebody comes into my house and takes a baseball card,
and he's supposed to have probable cause and he doesn't,
I don't see why I can't go get a judge or a magistrate,
determine whether he had at my baseball card, and pretty
quickly, too.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Some of them are worth --
JUSTICE BREYER: But if you go to the other
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a lot of money. Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: If you go to the other,
which is whether there’s an innocent owner or whether
in fact you should give bail to the property -- I mean,
that's -- I know we give bail to people, but I don't
know that we give bail to property. Maybe real
property, but that seems a much more complex argument.
So I want to know: What's your authority
that we should give bail to the property and have a
hearing on that?
--
MR. PETERS: I don’t --
JUSTICE BREYER: And why do you give up in
respect to baseball cards or anything in effect to the
first?
MR. PETERS: Well, I wouldn’t like to give
up my favorite baseball card, but the reason that I said
that, Your Honor, is this: The Mathews criteria, which
we are espousing here, require a cost-benefit analysis,
and if the value of the property under that -- using
that criteria does not warrant a hearing, then as to
that property, there shouldn't be a hearing. So there
doesn't have to be a hearing in every case. There may
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it’s as -- so
it's as applied in every case, which I think ties in a
little bit to the mootness question that we began with.
Because it focuses on the circumstances of the
individual claimants, and if the individual claimants
have already had their property returned, I think it
accentuates the mootness issue.
MR. PETERS: I -- I continue to maintain,
Your Honor, that the -- as long as there was standing
when the case was filed, and as long as there is a live
class that could be represented by these class -- or
putative class --
JUSTICE SCALIA: “My potential class,” you
should call it.
MR. PETERS: Potential class. Yes, Your
Honor.
Then there is standing on -- and I believe
that the standing can be established through the
Geraghty decision. I agree that it is not literally
identical to Geraghty, but I think the underlying
circumstances that animated the Court's decision in that
case are the same and that, therefore, these people
maintain standing.
If, however, in response to a question
that you asked Mr. Castiglione earlier, if the case
became moot as a result of the return of the property,
then it wouldn't be a Munsingwear situation. It would
be a Bancorp v. Bonner situation, because if it became
moot as a result of the settlement of the case after the
Seventh Circuit's decision, then the Seventh Circuit's
decision should stay in place.
So if -- I do not agree that the case is
moot, but if hypothetically the case were moot, then we
are not in a Munsingwear situation; we are in a Bancorp
situation, because the mootness --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's an
interesting -- that's an interesting question. I mean,
is it becoming moot through their voluntary cessation or
activity when the State law requires them to take
particular action?
MR. PETERS: No, what -- what I'm saying,
Your Honor, is if we're -- if we're defining mootness as
the ultimate return of the property, then the property
was returned pursuant to settlements in four of the
cases. The plaintiffs agreed, we’ll pay $400 instead of
$20,000, if you return our car. The car was returned.
So if the case was settled and became moot
because of the settlement, it is not a situation in
which the Court can adopt the Munsingwear position. It
really is a Bancorp situation, and the Seventh Circuit's
decision remains --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, all of these
problems really arise out of the fact that the effect of
the court of appeals’ decision basically was to overrule
the motion to dismiss, left everything open on remand.
So if we said it is moot, you'll just get another
plaintiff and bring another lawsuit, which is what you
do if the Court -- we are trying to get into the case
much earlier than we should, it seems to me. Just let
the proceedings go ahead on remand and find out what all
the -- all these factual answers that -- or these
questions that should be answered.
MR. PETERS: I certainly agree with that,
Your Honor. The -- there are many --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The mootness -- the
mootness decision won't really decide anything. You'll
just say you’ve got to file another lawsuit and start
over again.
MR. PETERS: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But if you just say, we –-
probably, in my judgment, we ought to dismiss this writ
as improvidently granted and let the record be developed
and the case go by, and we could decide the issues.
MR. PETERS: That, it seems to me, is a very
wise choice of action.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But where you said –- you
said that --
MR. PETERS: For obvious reasons. But
beyond that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the Seventh
Circuit -- your complaint, you say, is -- you asked for
the universe, every kind of property of due process
hearing within 10 days or a short period. But you said
the Seventh Circuit narrowed the relief. And I'm
looking at the Seventh Circuit decision, and I really
don't see what was narrowed. I think they left
everything open for the district Court.
MR. PETERS: Well, they --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is there
any narrowing?
MR. PETERS: Well, the narrowing, as I
perceive it, Your Honor, is this: I believe the Court
said at different times whether an appropriate remedy
can be fashioned. The Court did not say for whom. It
didn't say it must be for everybody. It didn't say what
would be necessary to trigger the right to the hearing.
It didn't say how much time would elapse.
It left -- it did leave, in that sense,
everything open, but by leaving everything open, it also
allows the court to narrow the categories of people who
would be entitled to this hearing that -- in such a way
that it would be an effective practical remedy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. PETERS: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Castiglione, why
don't you take 3 minutes?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL CASTIGLIONE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Thank you, Your Honor.
Well, Your Honor, initially, two of the
claimants here lost their property. They defaulted.
Three had their property returned. This is not a case
where the matter -- the underlying matter is concluded
by voluntary cessation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought they didn't. I
thought some didn't have it returned, but there was a
settlement.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: One did, Your Honor, but
it wasn't in response to the Federal litigation. So our
position would be if this is moot, this is really --
Munsingwear would apply.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The mootness was not a
result of any settlement between the city and --
MR. CASTIGLIONE: That's correct. Well, I
mean -- it didn’t settle because of the lawsuit.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your friend said
the opposite. I mean --
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, it settled, Your
Honor, just as through a normal course. It was not a
response to the Federal litigation that was going on
independently.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, I'm –-
JUSTICE SCALIA: They got all of their
property back?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Oh, no, no. In most
cases, yes, Your Honor. The private -- the hearing --
the cases went to hearing and the three -- with the
three car owners and they ultimately received their cars
back.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't understand.
They got their cars back, right?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The people who had money at
stake, what happened to the money?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Two of them -- two
defaulted and one reached a settlement with the State.
JUSTICE SCALIA: A settlement?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes, sir.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you have at least one
case where the mootness is attributable to a settlement.
You have at least one plaintiff, and you can't get the
kind of remand for mootness that you are asking for.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: No, I understand, Your
Honor. I'm just making the point that if this case --
if the Court finds it's moot, that we would want --
would ask for an entry of an order vacating the
orders below pursuant to -- pursuant to Munsingwear.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But we don't do Munsingwear
orders where -- where the mootness is a result of a
settlement.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Our position, Your Honor,
is that the settlement wasn't in response. We didn't
settle the Federal -- we didn't settle the Federal
litigation. The -- the underlying forfeiture case was
-- was resolved.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your
answer is that they didn't all settle.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: They all didn't settle.
That's right. In fact, that's a better answer, I think,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what good would a
Munsingwear order do, anyway? They'll just file another
lawsuit, won't they?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: They could.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: They certainly could, if
you -- they have the right to do that, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And then if the district
judge said -- having read this opinion, which was
vacated, says, well, I guess it states a cause of
action, I will deny the motion to dismiss -- we would
be exactly where we are now.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: We -- and we would. There
is no doubt about that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I just get
clarification?
Under your State law, there is no way for an
owner to come in and challenge probable cause to seize?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: There --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not a defense --
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but the examples
Judge Breyer said: My car was just sitting there.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: There is not, Your Honor.
I mean, the forfeiture is not going to help.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And, second,
is there any procedure under your State law to do the
second half of what your adversary said he was looking
for, a remission-type proceeding that would balance the
government's need to hold the property and the
individual's need for it, and whether there is a bond
that could be posted or not?
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Not that we –- Illinois
doesn’t provide for a bond, Your Honor. As we
indicated, there are problems with bonds, certainly for
cash and for -- and for other personal property as well,
but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that may be part
of the Mathews issue, that once you prove probable
cause, giving away -- giving back money just never would
probably be rational to hold a hearing about, but that
might not be true for real property, correct?
Under -- even under Mathews, under -- in a
Mathews analysis.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: I'm not sure I understand
Your Honor's question.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you apply a Mathews
analysis --
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the multifaceted item
would say for the seizure of cash, maybe only the
hearing has to address probable cause, but for real
property it has to go further. Not real property, in
the sense of real personal property. It has to go
further, because there has to be some sort of
protection of the interest of the individual, pending --
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Let me attempt to address
that. The -- the statute does contemplate, Your Honor,
section -- especially section 6 of DAFPA, nonjudicial
remedies, and then essentially if the amount of property
is under 20,000 or if we are dealing with a car, which
falls under section 6, those cases are routinely dealt
with by negotiation, Your Honor.
And I think that's the best way to deal with
hardship -- the hardship examples given -- is that both
through negotiation and a speedy hearing --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
The case is submitted.
MR. CASTIGLIONE: Thank you, Your Honor.
