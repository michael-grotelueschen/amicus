CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 13-1175, the City of Los
Angeles v. Patel.
Mr. Rosenkranz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case is about whether to deprive scores
of cities of one of the most effective tools that they
have developed to deter human trafficking, prostitution,
and drug crimes that have seized the -- the ground in
America's hotels and motels.
The ordinance in question is the least
intrusive of -- inspection scheme that this Court has
ever encountered.  It is limited to showing the police a
single book containing only information that the hotels
transcribe specifically for the city and that they've
been turning over to the police by operation of law for
150 years.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you -- first, two
questions:  Is the information that they've been keeping
for 150 years the same?  Because looking at the
requirements, the early information was basically
somebody's name and -- I'm not even sure -- their
address.  But today's information has -- or today's
registry and requirements have information that Federal
law doesn't permit to be disclosed, like driver's
license, credit card information.  I mean, Federal law
says you can't disclose that information.
So isn't there a difference?  It's not the
same tradition over 150 years.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  You are right, Your Honor,
that the amount of information has increased.  The
privacy interests, however, have been pretty much the
same.  It was name and address and the rate that they
were charged and so forth, and that is the -- the -- the
information that the -- that the hotels have argued is
the most private.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right.  All of the
things that you say, the most effective tool for
trafficking, prostitution, child molestation, none of
that sounds like it's -- the purpose of the search is
administrative.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, it is administrative,
Your Honor, and to understand why it's administrative,
you have to focus first on the target.  The target here
is not people who are accused of crimes.  The target is
the motels and the hotels who are required to keep
records, to record information.  And why are they
required to record the information?  For the deterrent
purpose, and the deterrent purpose more specifically is
that criminals do not like to register.  They do not
like to record their information.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rosenkranz, are you
saying then that the police can do this -- can request
these records on demand, and they don't have to have any
reason at all -- no reasonable suspicion, no probable
cause, nothing -- because the purpose is to deter people
from staying in hotels who might do bad things.  So
no -- nothing like a reasonable suspicion requirement.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That's correct, Your Honor.
It's the same rationale that this Court adopted in
Burger, that frequent, unannounced spot inspections are
necessary in order to achieve that deterrent purpose;
that if the hotels do not record all the names, and more
specifically, they record most names but not the names
of the -- of the guests that they know are criminals,
there's no way to know, unless you have this frequent,
unannounced inspection, that someone is missing.  So
there's a real necessity here as there was in Burger and
in Biswell.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell me how many
prosecutions there have been -- and I use the word both
criminally or civil -- for the failure to register
people?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, there have been
numerous prosecutions.  I can't tell you how many.  The
complaints in this case, which are in the beginning of
the joint appendix, refer to the plaintiffs having been
prosecuted multiple times, or fined, for failure -- for
failing to keep the records.
And I guess I do want to underscore this
point about necessity.  The problem is not that the
registers are empty.  The problem is that the hotels
decline to record the names of those who they know are
criminals, or the motels do --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that has nothing to
do with the free right to search.  Those people who are
refusing to do it are going to refuse to do it.  A
recordkeeping requirement has no -- has no
constitutional challenge.  What does is the unfettered
access to that record.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Agreed, Your Honor, and so
let me just break it down.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Those people who don't
want to do it are not going to do it anyway.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Exactly.  Those people who
don't want to do it go somewhere else or don't commit
their crimes, but if they -- if they are forced to do
it, which is to say the motel won't let them stay there
unless they register, then they will not commit those
crimes in the motels.  And the only way to make sure
that the motels are enforcing that obligation is to
descend on them without notice as -- as Justice Ginsburg
was saying, and frequently, so that they never know when
the police are going to come.  Why?  To make sure that
they are indeed recording the information.
And why is the real time observation key?
It's because they've been busy, the police show up and
they have a register, and they notice that room
number -- room No. 2 is unoccupied according to the
register, but they see someone in room No. 2.  They know
only from real time observation that there is a violation
here.  If they get the register a month later, they have
nothing to compare it to.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- you mean they can
walk up and down the halls and see that nobody's in the
certain room?  I don't know quite how you do that.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, the way
it works in particular --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You have room No. 2 as if
it's right there, but room No. 1204 --
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So motels, for example, are
out in the open.  You can sit there and see --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What about my question
about room 1204?  You seem to say the police can wander
all over the hotel.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, if -- the police may
be allowed to wander around the hotel.  They probably
will not see much if what they're doing is wandering
back and forth looking at particular rooms.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose in motels they
can see what rooms have cars in front of them.  And I
suppose as to room 1204 they can see, usually behind the
desk what -- what keys are missing, what -- what rooms
appear not to be occupied.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That's correct, Your Honor,
and that's why the real time observation is so key,
because you can't do that a month later.  And that's why
we have the same necessity --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sure.  Why?  I mean,
what you're saying is it's easier to prosecute, but it
doesn't mean that you can't devote some resources and
find this out.  You do a surveillance which is what
police do for a lot of crimes.  And you watch people
going in for two hours and leaving, and you keep a
record of it.  You can even stop those people who are
leaving to ask them.
So there's a whole lot of law enforcement
techniques that could be used to combat the situations
you're talking about.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  But not nearly as
effectively, Your Honor, because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, since when has the
Fourth Amendment completely been abandoned to how
effective the proof that the police can get at a moment
should be?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, that's
not the test.  But Dewey refers to the fact that it's
not as effective, and it simply doesn't work, Your
Honor.  Let me give you an example.
If all the police are doing is looking for
who's in what room and what keys are missing, they don't
actually know what to look for until long after the
fact.  They may be looking for the wrong thing.  And
there are many motels where they can't -- where they
can't do it, for example, look at the keys because
they're not available and easy to see.  And so it's
having the information right in front of them, and then
comparing it to things that they might be able to
observe.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Rosenkranz, why
isn't this just like Barlow's really?  That it's not
necessary on the following rationale:  Number one, most
people will consent so that you go -- the police go into
a hotel and say we'd like to see your registry, most
people are going to consent.  If somebody says no, and
there's a real basis for believing that the evidence is
going to be altered or destroyed, you can seize it
pending judicial review, or you can get an
administrative warrant ex parte and conduct a surprise
examination if you want to.
So we talked about all of those things in
Barlow's, about how -- why that suggested that these
warrantless searches were not necessary.  What makes
this different?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, what makes this
different is the distinction between Barlow's on the one
hand and Burger, Dewey, Biswell, Colonnade, on the other
hand, and that is the movability of information.  That
is the transience and -- of the information that you use
to verify.
In Barlow's, if there is an unsafe
condition, there is an unsafe condition, and it's hard
to see.  The -- this Court said it also in See and
distinguished -- and Biswell distinguished See on that
ground.  If you -- if you -- if it's the sort of
condition that doesn't change over time, you can get a
warrant, and it doesn't affect your --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What's --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Go ahead.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What's going to -- what's
going to change here?  The registry is the registry, and
as I said, if in an unusual case you have the feeling
that the hotel is complicit, you can make sure to freeze
the registry.  But that's going to be an unusual case,
and mostly, the registry is going to be there.
And, you know, as I said mostly people are
going to consent.  To the extent not you can go get a
warrant.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, what
will -- what would change is, is the information on the
basis of which you draw that comparison.  If you only
compare the register -- if you get the register a month
later, you can't compare it to facts on the ground to --
to the cause --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  A month later doesn't -- you
know, it -- it's an hour later.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, you mean get a
warrant within hour?  Warrants within an hour are -- are
not that easy to get, particularly --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the probable cause
for the warrant?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, there is -- that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you haven't seen the
register, what's the probable cause?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Right, there is no probable
cause.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What, do you have to have a
policeman sit outside the hotel for -- for days to -- I
mean, you don't have probable cause unless you know that
there -- there are people who are, you know, in -- in
the room for a short time who haven't registered.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Right.  That -- that's
exactly right.  But -- and warrants are for probable
cause.  That's why Burger and Biswell said no, you don't
need to get a warrant when you're doing an
administrative inspection.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you prevail in this
case and a member of the Court sits down to write the
opinion, does he or she have to use the phrase
"reasonable expectation of privacy" and say there is no
reasonable expectation of privacy in our society, in our
culture, in our day, or do we just forget that phrase?
In -- in a way, as we all know it's circular, that if we
say there is a reasonable expectation, then there is.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, the
answer depends upon which Fourth Amendment rubric one
uses.  Under the Burger line of cases, the Court looks
at the statute, asks is this a closely regulated
business?  Was it necessary?  Is it a legitimate non-law
enforcement purpose, and so forth.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is closely regulated
another way to talk about reasonable expectation of
privacy?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, indeed it is.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We talk about that in the
Katz case, the telephone booth case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I'm not sure that --
is that still a phrase that's -- that's necessary and
required for us to address in an opinion like this?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  If the Court adopts the
Burger rubric, what the Court was doing in Burger was
saying because this is so heavily regulated in the
context of this case, because everyone knows that these
registers have been reviewed by the police for 15 years,
no one goes into the hole -- into the hotel business
unaware that their registers will be inspected.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whose expectation of
privacy are we talking about?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  We are talking only about
the hotel.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not the hotel guests;
right?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor.  The motel
-- the plaintiffs have taken the position that this is
not about the expectation of privacy of the guests.
JUSTICE SCALIA:
thought.  It's --
MR. ROSENKRANZ:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
MR. ROSENKRANZ:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
It's -- it's dear to me.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:
Yes.  That's what I
But only --
-- of the hotel.
Yes.
You can't see my register.
Even though I have entered
a business that for 115 years has revealed these
registers and for 100 of those years, actually revealed
the registers to the guests.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Who --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose that there's a --
Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose that there's a statute that says
that the taxing authority, the IRS or the equivalent on
the State level, that the taxing authority can go into
businesses at any time and check payroll records; and
the reason is that they need to conduct these surprise,
warrantless searches because there's a serious problem
with businesses ginning up false payroll records.  Is
that constitutional?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I would think not, Your
Honor, at least not without more information.  And the
difference is, there -- there isn't this long history of
the government reviewing payroll records.  And
secondly -- or at least it's a closer question.  And
secondly, payroll records are not the sorts of things
for which you need spot inspections.  If someone --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about the hiring --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  If the government says
that they do -- the government says that if you wait
till they submit everything at the end of the year,
they'll falsify a lot of records, and we really need to
see what's happening right now on the ground in
real time.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, either a
payroll record is false or it's not.  You don't need
real time verification to figure out if it's false or
not.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, you do, because you
don't want to give them the time to falsify things till
the end of the year.  I mean, we -- we could have a
thousand examples like this.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  And -- and my answer is
still the same.  It doesn't have the same real time need
to verify against facts that are --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know why not.
Checking to see if people are actually registered, you
don't know that until you see a person working.  So
you've got a construction site.  You count the number of
people; and you say, let me see your recordkeeping for
your employees today.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, that
was --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a real time need.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  It's a -- it's -- but
either the record -- either the ultimate record that is
submitted is false or it's not.  You -- you don't have
the real time ability to verify whether those records
are --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You just --
MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  -- correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You just keep a
register -- you falsify the register the way that you're
saying these people would.
I -- my problem with the closely held --
closely regulated is I don't see one regulation that's
not applicable to virtually every public accommodation
entity, whether it's a telephone company or a day school
or a hospital.
I mean, virtually all of these requirements
that you list are part of the normal State regulation of
entities that serve people.
Is it your position now that once we say
this is closely regulated, that everything is --
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that serves the
public in some way?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No.  And I see I'm eating
into my rebuttal time, so if I may answer quickly.
No.  There -- first of all, the closely
regulated exception is not -- is -- is way more than
just closely regulated.  There are three other elements
to it, and you need to demonstrate the necessity, you
need to demonstrate that it's not a criminal justice
purpose, and you need to demonstrate that there's an
adequate substitute for a warrant.
So if there are no further questions, I'd
like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Dreeben.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
This Court can resolve this case on a much
narrower basis than it has used in looking at other
administrative inspection schemes, such as the one in
Barlow's.
The Ninth Circuit itself recognized that
this case did not involve an entry into the nonpublic
working places of a business.  It did not involve an
entry into a residential property.  It involved an entry
only into the public lobby area of a motel and a brief
inspection of the registry of the motel.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that doesn't
seem very significant.  I mean, it -- it could well
involve entry into a drawer.  We wouldn't normally say,
well, because you can -- our rule is not simply because
you can get into a house, for example, that you're free
to rummage through desks.
MR. DREEBEN:  That's certainly right, but
what the -- this statute requires is that the registry
be produced for inspection.  And the way in which the
officer gets to the registry is to walk into the lobby.
And so the Ninth Circuit --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  You're
saying that if a police officer stands outside a house
and says, bring me whatever it is I want from inside,
and he brings it out, that's not a violation of the
Fourth Amendment because he, under compulsion, tells the
person you have to bring me what's inside, because I
can't enter under the Fourth Amendment.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, it
would be a search.  The reasonableness of it would
depend on the facts, but what -- what my --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that's the point.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- my point here is that this
is -- we're dealing here with businesses which have
reduced expectations of privacy, and we are not dealing
with entry into the nonpublic areas of the businesses,
which is what Marshall's was concerned with, Colonnade,
Biswell, Burger, all of those cases.
So the Ninth Circuit itself did not apply
the rules that govern those kinds of situations where
the Court has sometimes said an administrative warrant
is required and other times said it is not.
JUSTICE ALITO:  This is a facial challenge.
Now, are there any or a substantial number of instances
in which the application of this statute would be
constitutional?
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I -- I think there
would, Justice Alito, in -- if there were exigent
circumstances that justified the access to the registry.
And most importantly --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but then you don't
need the statute.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the statute helps
because it informs the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- hotels.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There are exigent
circumstances.  You can get -- get a warrant.
MR. DREEBEN:  Yeah.  Well, you don't have to
get a warrant.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So that doesn't work.
MR. DREEBEN:  No, I think it works, Justice
Kennedy, in the sense that the -- the statute provides
encouragement for a potentially recalcitrant hotel owner
to produce it, because it's an offense for him not to.
But more importantly, I think for the
Court's evaluation of the facial challenge issue is that
there's no record in this case about what kind of
privacy expectations actually exist with respect to
hotel registries.  It's largely a matter of conjecture,
speculation, and everybody's intuition of --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't think -- I don't
see why we've ever required more.  All we've required is
a person to say, this is my business record.
And why do they have to prove more?
MR. DREEBEN:  Because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- what are they
suppose to prove, that they don't use -- that they don't
show it to anyone else?  We've never required that.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think that they should
show that there's a certain degree of confidentiality
associated with it that they in fact --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, there is today
when the Federal law requires that you not disclose
credit card information and driver's license information
and these registries contain that information.  So you
can't have it both ways.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The registries --
MR. DREEBEN:  -- some --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- by law are required
to have the driver's license information taken for
people who are paying cash --
MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and requires the
credit card information of people who are otherwise
registering.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the registry doesn't
have to have the credit card information unless they
check in at a kiosk.  And this, I think, brings up a
very important point.  What the Ninth Circuit did was
facially invalidate the statute that said that
regardless of any facts, it can't be enforced against
anyone.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah.  I -- I assume that,
you know, if the problem is license plates and credit
card information and all of that, it's not up to the
hotel to complain about that invasion of privacy.  It's
up to the guests, right?
MR. DREEBEN:  I would agree with that,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And this case does not
involve the guests.  It's just the hotel who's
objecting.
MR. DREEBEN:  It's just the hotel, and there
is a range of situations in which different information
is maintained in different ways.
So I think that treating it as a facial
challenge is problematic; but if you reach the merits,
what the Ninth Circuit itself did is conclude that this
case doesn't trigger the very strong safeguards that are
triggered when there is an invasion of a nonpublic space
of a business.  They treat it as if it's an
administrative subpoena case, which does have Fourth
Amendment requirements associated with it; but those
requirements are that the subpoena be relevant, that it
be reasonable in scope, and that it be specific.
And the Ninth Circuit conceded that all
three of those requirements are satisfied, Section
41.49, by itself establishes the relevance of the
information for the administrative purpose that the
statute serves.  It is specific and it is narrow in
scope.  And anybody who goes into the hotel industry
knows that that is a -- an inspection that they are
subjected to.
The Ninth Circuit --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How -- how do you
distinguish -- is it Marshall and Barlow?
Do I -- do I have the right name?
MR. DREEBEN:  You do, Justice Kennedy.
And the distinction which the Ninth Circuit,
itself drew is that involved entry into the nonpublic
areas of a business which exposes a much wider range of
information to the inspection of the authorities.
Marshall covered every industry in
interstate commerce, and it allowed OSHA inspections
without any limitation.  And in that circumstance --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I don't understand
that, Mr. Dreeben.  You're saying that it makes a
difference constitutionally whether you keep the
registry at the front desk or in the back office?
MR. DREEBEN:  What I'm saying, Justice
Kagan, is that the Ninth Circuit analyzed it precisely
that way, that you can walk into the lobby of a hotel.
This Court so said in the Lone Steer case, you're not
invading any expectation of privacy.  All you do is you
ask the hotel keeper, the front desk clerk, to show you
the register, which can be done as -- simply by just
moving the computer screen so that the officer can see
it.  And that is the most minimal intrusion on privacy
interests, if they exist.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if I were running a
hotel, I think I might have -- prefer to have two
uniformed detectives in the backroom so the guests don't
see it.  I think it's quite intrusive.
MR. DREEBEN:  The Ninth Circuit treated it
as a lesser degree of intrusion than an inspection of
all of the private areas of the business; and that's why
it applied the subpoena line of cases.  But once you
apply the subpoena line of cases, you realize that the
statute itself serves the purposes that that line of
cases is designed to serve.
And the only remaining claim that's
really -- well, the judicial review will be very
difficult to accomplish in this case, because the whole
purpose of this administrative scheme is, we're not --
you know, we regulate prostitutes, we regulate narcotics
activity through the criminal law.  The place where they
are frequently conducting it are low-budget motels that
have a strong incentive to take cash and not fill out a
registry and allow this kind of criminal activity to
flourish.
So the regulatory purpose of 41.49 is to
target not the criminals, but the place where they
conduct their activity.  And doing it in a classic
administrative way.  This is lawful activity; you can
rent a room.  You just have to not rent it to people for
cash, for short terms, for no reservations, when they
don't have an identification to show who they are, and
you need to keep a record of what you're doing.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Dreeben, I'm trying to
figure out what do you think is relevant here; so let me
give you a hypo, which is say that it's not a hotel, but
it's a hunting lodge.  And there are recordkeeping
requirements about how much people shoot and when they
shoot them and what they shoot, and so forth and so on.
And the fish and wildlife service or some state
equivalent of that says, we do not -- we do not want to
rely on people reporting this to us at periodic points,
we just want to make spot inspections, surprise
inspections, all the time.  Would that be all right?
MR. DREEBEN:  It seems like a much more
difficult case to me, Justice Kagan, in part because --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is this a public hunting
lodge?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's a private hunting
lodge, this was a private hotel.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's a big
difference, isn't it?
MR. DREEBEN:  I will have to defer to
members of the Court on hunting lodges.
(Laughter.)
MR. DREEBEN:  But I think that interest that
is being served there is far weaker than the interest
that is being served here, which is a genuine problem
reflected in the fact that there are a hundred statutes
like this across the country in different sounds --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Wait, that's how you're
going to distinguish it, Just because it's more
important?  Because the fish and wildlife people think
that it's really, awfully very important to make sure
that all these rules are -- are complied with.
MR. DREEBEN:  I agree with that, Justice
Kagan, but I do think that this Court in it's classic
Fourth Amendment analysis balances the government
interest to be served against the nature of the
intrusion.
I don't know enough about the hunting lodges
that you have in mind to really gage the nature of the
intrusion.  I will say this, that a mere requirement
that you expose books and records that you're required
to keep as a regulatory matter, and that no one disputes
you're required to keep, to a law enforcement officer in
a public area of your facility, that's this case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There -- there -- there is
no dispute here that you can require the hotel to keep
the records.
MR. DREEBEN:  That is correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that right?
MR. DREEBEN:  The hotels are not challenging
that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think there would be a
big dispute with regard to private hunting lodges,
whether you could require them to keep the records.
MR. DREEBEN:  And there may be Second
Amendment concerns that the Court would weigh in the
balance.
I think that the Court can resolve this
case, in an extremely narrow fashion.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I think it's even
more dangerous.  Look at almost how many businesses,
retail businesses transact their recordkeeping in public
areas.  Talk about any shop in the country.  They don't
go to the back, virtually any of them, and transact
their business, keep their credit card information.
They put it right on the computer in front of them.  So,
I mean --
MR. DREEBEN:  I -- I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it can't be that
merely ask -- intruding on someone's private
information, in a public place eliminates the Fourth
Amendment.
MR. DREEBEN:  May I answer?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
MR. DREEBEN:  I think you ask -- asked three
questions, Justice Sotomayor; first, the substantiality
of the government interests; second, the nature of the
intrusion on privacy; and third, necessity.  And there
is a strong need in the case of these hotels, where
prostitution and narcotics activity flourish because
criminals do not want to identify themselves when they
check in, to have regular, unannounced inspections to
give the hotels the incentive to comply with the
registration law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Goldstein.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it
please the Court:
We ask the Court to hold that the city does
not need to go to the judge in advance and get a
warrant, but instead, that it merely needs to issue us a
one-page subpoena.  Now, we can object to that subpoena,
but it's going to be enforced unless the city isn't
actually implementing a legitimate administrative scheme
because it's searching us to harass us or to investigate
crimes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it -- is it your
position that there is no instance in which this statute
and the -- the implementation of it would be
constitutional?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is because the hypothesis
that you would use it for, exigent circumstances or when
would you have waived the right to privacy by putting it
out on the desk, don't actually involve the enforcement
of the statute.
What's necessary here, the value that's in
the Fourth Amendment, is the requirement that there be a
regularized scheme.  Now, it's going to be a regularized
scheme that either appears in the administrative rule
itself.  That doesn't exist here.  There's no limit on
when they can search, how often they can search, or the
reason they can search.  And if there isn't that, then
we put a court into the process.  We make
pre-enforcement judicial reviewable available, and the
reason is the Fourth Amendment protects our sense of
tranquility.  The hotel owners, individuals in other
contexts, businesses in other contexts, need to know
that beat officers aren't going to, at their whim,
conduct these searches.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose that a city or a
State wanted to establish an administrative inspection
regime along the lines of Barlow's?  What would it --
what would it have to include in your judgment?  Could
they -- could the warrant be issued by an administrative
law judge --
MR. ROSENKRANZ:
JUSTICE ALITO:
court judge in California?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:
Yes.
-- as opposed to a superior
Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Would it have -- would it
require probable cause?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could they -- could it be
done without prior notice?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you have different
standards for different types of hotels?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  If there is --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Periodic inspections for all
hotels, but much more frequent inspections for hotels
that rent by the hour, hotels that have a large number
of guests who pay in cash, and so forth?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All those things could be
done.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Now if that's okay, it's
really not clear to me what that would add to the
ordinance that we have before us.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Great.  And that was,
Justice Kennedy asked how we -- how Barlow's plays out
in this context.  So Mr. Dreeben is half right in his
answer.  He is absolutely right that the Court has said,
look, if you're not physically inspecting the premises,
then you don't have to, ahead of time, get a warrant.
And, Justice Scalia, it's not a probable
cause criminal warrant.  All the Court has required in
this line of cases is that the government show that it's
part of an ordinarily administrative scheme.
But the second part is what's missing, and
the key case that's mentioned in passing by Mr. Dreeben,
it hasn't gotten enough attention in the case, it's
called Donovan v. Lone Steer.  And it was decided by --
an opinion by then Justice Rehnquist, it's an unanimous
opinion, and it considers a circumstance very similar to
this, and that is, under the Fair Labors Standards Act,
the government can do just what it does here, and that
is it just demands employment records.
And the reason this Court said that that
comports with the Fourth Amendment is there is a
balance, and that is that the government has to issue a
subpoena to which the employer can object.  And that
accomplishes two things.  The first is, without
burdening the government, it interjects the possibility
of judicial review and that way you know that the
enforcement officer --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what would be the
nature of the objection?  I'm going back to
Mr. Rosenkranz's answer to my question.  He said, the --
there is no notion of probable cause, reasonable cause.
The hotel owner is required to keep these records and
the -- that's not disputed.  They're each required to
keep them.  And so -- and the police don't have to have
any reason.
What would be -- what would be shown by some
kind of a hearing?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure, Your Honor.  This
line -- this Court's consistent line of precedents,
there are six cases that have dealt with this subpoena
rule, have said the following:  And that is, the
concern, when you have a scheme like this one that
doesn't tell the officer how often or when to search,
and -- is that the officer will do two things that are
forbidden by the Fourth Amendment.  One is they'll do it
in a harassing way, and the second is they'll use it for
crime control.
And the latter is a real concern here.  The
city is avowedly saying it wants to look at the record
to, for example, find prostitutes or the Johns who are
involved in renting the rooms.  And so that's why what
you do is you let the police issue the subpoena.  They
don't go to the judge ahead of time.  But the prospect
that there can be an objection and that you can go to a
judge is what protects the -- the sense of tranquility
of the business owner.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what's the
purpose -- you agree that it's constitutional to require
the registry?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Absolutely.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay.  Why is the State
interested in requiring the register if it can't go look
at it with little notice?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Ah --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's the point?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Kennedy, the
fact that its only interest is in law enforcement I
think is a point in our favor.  But just recognize that
what Mr. Rosenkranz is describing as the scenario that
gave rise to your question about room 1202 we think is
entirely inaccurate.  So if I could just play out the
hypothetical.
His point is as follows:  An officer shows
up at a motel, and sees someone in a room -- sees a
light on in room 2.  We'll give him his best case.  And
what he wants to do then is to go and look and, right
then, determine, look, there is a registration card for
room 2.  Now, I don't know what that proves, because he
doesn't know that anything inappropriate is going on in
room 2, but it doesn't matter.  What the officer does is
he makes a record:  There was someone in room 2 on
June 1st 12:00 a.m.  And then he comes back two days
later and serves the subpoena.
There is no reason in the world -- that
doesn't give any advance notice to the motel owner.  If
he has a particular concern, then he can sequester the
records so that they can have them held separately, if
there is going to be an objection, which is extremely
rare.  There is no reason -- his concern is about
contemporaneous observation.  That's not the issue in
the case.  He can sit outside and look outside the room.
The issue in the case is do you have to go in and have
no opportunity for a judge to be involved before you
search the records.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Seeing the light on doesn't
prove anything unless you know that the hotel has not
registered the person who is in the room.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And --
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  -- remember, our objection
is not to them being able to either require the register
or inspect the register.  Neither one of those is at
issue.  The question is, can they do that without giving
us any opportunity to say to a judge what's actually
going on in here is law enforcement or harassment;
they've come in five times during the day.  And that
system, which is they issued the subpoena, right?  They
don't go to the judge ahead of time, they come up, they
show -- they give me a subpoena, right, and they say, we
want the records, and if there is an objection, the
officer has made the observation about room 2.
And they can go ahead -- telephonic warrants
are easy, but there's no reason that the subpoena
objection can't be heard by a judge later on.  He's
already observed and made a note about what's going on
in the hotel.
Now, I will say --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They -- they -- they could
fill in.  While he's running off getting his subpoena,
they fill in who was in that room.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The subpoena is -- Justice
Scalia, the subpoena -- he's not running off anywhere.
The subpoena is simply handed at the desk.  This is an
administrative one-page piece of paper.  But let me just
say --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no -- sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He has it in his pocket?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  That's how --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All you're asking for, all
this litigation, is just that the one who wants to
inspect it just pulls out a piece of paper and hands it
to him and that makes it all okay.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.  There's two parts to
this, Justice Scalia.  That's how a subpoena works.  The
reason this Court has asserted -- has required that is
the bare minimum, except in the very limited Burger
context, is that when you hand the subpoena, the person
who receives the subpoena says, this is an unusual case,
I'm going to go to the trouble of objecting.  I think I
can tell a judge and prove to a judge that this is law
enforcement in -- in disguise.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He could say the same thing
without the subpoena.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, but that's -- our
critical point is that this guarantees him the right to
say that to a judge.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And I thought --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It allows him the
opportunity, while the policeman is getting a subpoena,
to fill in the name of the person in what is otherwise a
blank space.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, he's not
going to get a subpoena.  Subpoenas don't work that way.
Subpoenas are issued --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, I thought you
said that if he serves a subpoena, the other person can
demand judicial -- pre-enforcement judicial review.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, that's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the police
officer has to go somewhere to get the judicial review
with whoever the hotel owner sends.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, it might not work that
way, and that is, the hotel office -- the hotel owner
may have to file a motion to quash.  It's not
particularly important to your hypothetical.
Mr. Chief Justice, here's the problem with
that argument.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it is important to
the hypothetical because we're trying to figure out how
this works.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The policeman goes with a
subpoena and the hotel owner says, I object.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now what happens?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  He files --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And how long does it take?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It doesn't take any amount
of time, which is why the Court has consistently
required it.  And that is, he says, I'm not going to
give you the records.  I'm going to file a motion to
quash.  If the police want to enforce it right away,
they can go to an administrative judge and ask that it
be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  They go
somewhere.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  During that
time, doesn't the hotel clerk take his pen and say, I
didn't register this guy in room 2, I'm going to get in
trouble, and he fills in whatever is left to be filled
in.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.  For the reason given by
Justice Kagan, and that is, you can sequester the
records.  And that is, the question is searching the
records.  That is, we're talking about a set of cards.
And if this is a real concern -- now, I will say it is a
concern made up by the city's lawyers in this Court when
at trial they did not introduce any evidence of this and
it would be equally applicable in every kind of required
record.  The same is true in a construction site or Fair
Labor Standards Act.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So in a standard
construction subpoena, if you object and say, well, I'm
going to take these records and keep them in the police
car trunk until we resolve this?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, you can do that.  There
are two ways --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There's authority for
that?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There's authority from
this Court?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Oh, sure.  It's very similar
to what this Court has said in the Fourth Amendment
context.  Remember, when the police show up at someone's
house and they're concerned about the destruction of
evidence inside, what they do is simply sequester --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that's much
more intrusive than the scheme you're objecting to.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kennedy, I don't
think the government can have it both ways.  These are
our private records, okay?  And they want to do
something incredibly unusual that the Fourth Amendment
forbids, and that is, they want to have a scheme that
doesn't say when they'll search, how often they'll
search, or the purpose of the search.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're not entirely
private records --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- they're records required
by law to be kept and you are not objecting to that at
all.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Scalia, that's
absolutely right.  The other side makes a good point,
and that is, these are business records that will
receive reduced Fourth Amendment protection.  We
understand that.  So did the unanimous court in Lone
Steer.  What it said is, that's the reason we don't have
a probable cause requirement here.  That's why we
require the minimum amount of judicial process, which is
the prospect that if the owner has a good objection,
they can go to a judge.  That's why we don't have the
Fourth Amendment's full protections.  But remember --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Goldstein, I thought --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you said they could
be -- they can be -- they can be sequestered by the
police officer, they even answered before, that
suggested you have to have some outside approval.  But
now you're saying if the hotel owner says, you can't
have these records, the police can say, give me the
books and take them away.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  They cannot inspect
them, just hold them aside.  If this is a real problem,
which there's no evidence of, but if -- if they want to
just hold them aside, then that -- they can be just
sequestered.  Nobody looks at them until a judge
decides.
JUSTICE ALITO:  That's a seizure.  That is a
seizure.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.  Absolutely.
Justice --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So why is that justified and
looking at the information not?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  This Court has held that in
the identical circumstance, this arises in the Fourth
Amendment context.  When the government is concerned
about the destruction of evidence, before it can acquire
a warrant, it can sequester the property, that is, it
can seize control of the property without searching it.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, that's if it has
probable cause.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, it has the
relevant level of cause that's required in the
particular context.  We can't --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm confused by your answer.
I thought you said in response to my earlier questions
that the city could have a regime under which an
administrative law judge issues a warrant, not a
subpoena --
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- for a periodic
inspection.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So the -- the officer would
have the warrant, would go to the hotel, here's the
warrant, this is your periodic inspection.  There would
be no pre-judicial review.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:
JUSTICE ALITO:
to it later.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:
That is -- that's not right.
There could be a challenge
No, Your Honor.  When --
what this Court has said in cases like Camara and See,
and it's the distinction drawn in Lone Steer and
Barlow's, is that when you get the pre-enforcement
judicial review, that is the judicial evolvement that's
required.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Right.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right?  So we'd be perfectly
happy with that.  The difference between your
hypothetical and this one is that a judge is involved
and ensures that this isn't for law enforcement.  It's
the orderly operation of administrative scheme; whereas,
what the city wants is for a beat cop to be able to go
in at anytime, as often as he wants, for any purpose.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The complexity of the
answers and, frankly, the surprise I have at some of
your answers may indicate that this is not a basis for a
facial -- this is not a case for facial attack.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Let me --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Seems to me we have to go
back and -- and decide these issues on a case-by-case
basis.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I'll
give you my responses to that obviously, and that is, the
Court in all of the Colonnade line of cases and Camara
cases has dealt with things on a categorical basis.  It
has never done it on a case-by-case basis, because it is
look at the structure of the scheme, that is, this is a
scheme where they're not going to have any reason --
they don't need any justification to come in.  We know
what they can seize.  It's still limited, right?  It's a
particular record, but they can do it anytime.  And in
that kind of scheme, what the Court has consistently
insisted on, and I hope that the Court will take a look
at Lone Steer, is that there be this minimum of a
subpoena process.  I'm just describing, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I thought
the stronger answer would be we've always looked at a
lack of procedural protection under a facial
challenge --
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Certainly.  That's Sibron --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We did.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sibron says exactly --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.  So anytime
that the challenge as to the lack of process --
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- we've looked at it,
facially or as applied or whatever, but it doesn't need
to be as applied.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  And let me just add
one other point that's sort of under-appreciated in the
case, and that is, not only does our complaint assert an
as-applied challenge, there was a trial on the
as-applied challenge.  And the record on the as-applied
challenge is the record in this case.  We pursued our
facial challenge only after before the second trial they
stipulated that they had only facial defenses of the
statute.  That's the -- that's the reason we have this
oddity that we're here on a facial challenge.  The
evidence has already been collected.  There's nothing to
be gained by having a second trial.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would you -- would you --
you've constantly said that one of the objections that
the hotel owner can make is that you want these records
for enforcement of the criminal law, right?  You say
that's bad.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the whole purpose of
this thing is to enable the criminal law to be enforced,
isn't it?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Ah, Justice Scalia, there
are two different points that are being made here.  One
is, you're quite right.  They have an administrative
scheme.  The point of the administrative scheme is to
deter criminal violations.  But my point is different,
and that is, imagine on Tuesday a police officer comes
in and says, look, I think there's a prostitute in the
room 3, okay?  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
invoke this 41.49 and see if that person's name matches
up as a prostitute, okay?  That's criminal law
enforcement.  It requires probable cause.
The fact that they have an underlying
administrative scheme doesn't mean that they can
investigate crimes through using this evidence.  This
Court has said time and time again in its administrative
decisions that it's really important that we involve the
courts because there is this concern, and this case
presents it more starkly than any other, that you will
misuse the administrative process.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I think there may be
an exception to that principle where the whole purpose
of the scheme is to enable the detection of criminal
activity.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And then the objection
would be the whole scheme is bad.  You cannot require
them to keep books because its whole purpose is to
detect criminal activity.
But that's not what you're arguing.  You're
saying, they can keep the books in order to detect
criminal activity, but if they request the book in order
to detect criminal activity, it's bad.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, its --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't make any sense
at all.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Because it's not the
argument.  And that is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what is -- what is
the argument?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The argument is -- their
defense of the statute is not that the -- the records
are used to detect crime; it's they're used to deter
crime.  They don't look at the records to find
criminals.  All they do is look at the records to make
sure we're keeping records.
My point is that one day a police officer
under this -- and it can happen regularly, is that an
officer, a beat officer will come in and say, I'm not
concerned about whether you filled out the form; I
think there might be a prostitute in room 3, and use
it for criminal law --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, Mr. Goldstein, I had
thought that an equally important purpose behind these
laws is to -- as you said earlier, prevent harassment.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Prevent, I don't like this
hotel owner, I want to drive this hotel out of business,
I'm going to be showing up in his lobby every day.
But that's part of what's going on here,
isn't that right?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's -- in fact, the
principal thing that this Court's precedents have
pointed to -- and just look at what's missing in this --
in this ordinance.  Every time the other side will say
to you, look, we identified specifically the records.
But the question isn't what the records are, it's the
loss of the sense of tranquility provided by the Fourth
Amendment, that we don't know how frequently and for
what harassing purpose and how -- and for what reasons
at all that a police officer is just going to come in
over and over again.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Have we used that
phrase before?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Which one, Your Honor?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Tranquility.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I don't think that that word
is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We talk about
privacy and all that, but I'm not sure that the Fourth
Amendment should be expanded to protect the sense of
tranquility.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I'm trying to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I have a problem imagining
tranquil hotel owners.  It's not what I associate with
owning a hotel.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is the sense of certainty
that the Fourth Amendment provides that what you do know
is that there are going to be limits on when the police
come in and say, show us your papers.  Okay?  And that's
what we're talking about.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do -- I think
there's some rule -- at least they do it, I mean, in
hotels, they have these notices posted all over about
where the first emergency exit is and all that.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could police come in
and check to make sure the hotel has those posted --
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- without any type
of a warrant?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Because they're in public
spaces.  That is to say --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I don't know
-- is the back of a hotel room door -- I mean, is that a
private place?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So you're saying, say, for
example, in the back of the restaurant, in the back of
the kitchen, for example?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, I'm talking
about every hotel room --
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- has one of those
--
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Oh, inside the room.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can they go and say,
look, you know, this is a very important thing to make
sure people don't die in a big fire, we're going to make
sure you've got them.  Check -- let me go look in room
12 where nobody is.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It's a great example for us.
That's actually Camara and See; that's a fire inspection
regime.  And what has to happen is that there has to be
a subpoena ahead of time.
At the very least, this Court -- the lowest
level -- the lowest standard the Court has ever applied
is in a case called Dewey.  And what Dewey said is, at
the very least, if you're not going to involve a court,
you have to have a set of rules about when these
searches are going to apply, or are going to be
conducted, and how often.
JUSTICE ALITO:  This is -- I didn't quite
understand your answer about harassment.  Maybe it's
because -- maybe this is in the record or maybe it's
because this wasn't as applied.  But the police -- even
if this ordinance were invalidated, the police could
show up whenever they wanted, couldn't they, and ask for
the -- the owner or the person at the desk voluntarily
to disclose the register so there could be -- they could
be in the lobby as much as they want.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So exactly what does -- how
does this aid in harassment of hotels?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Because of the fact that
they're requiring us to produce private records.  The
Court -- it was always the case, in cases like Barlow's,
Camara, See, where the police couldn't show up and
inspect the premises, they could still show up and
harass.  But what the Court said is if you're going to
invade privacy -- we agree this is -- everyone agrees
now this is a Fourth Amendment search.
JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but it's a private --
it's a public space.  I don't know whether it's
dispositive, but it's of some relevance.
So they walk in -- there are two scenarios;
one, with the ordinance, one, without.  Without the
ordinance, they walk in and they said, would you, in the
kindness of your heart, let us look at the register.
And the owner says, no, I don't want to.  And then they
come back the next day and they do the same thing.
Okay?  That's the first scenario.
The second one is, they come in and they
say, let us see the register.  You show them the
register, and what?  It's a harassment because they sit
there for a while and the guests coming in see the
police in the lobby?  I just don't understand factually.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It's the fact -- it's the
fact that day after day after day we have to give them
our private information.  And it -- it really will
involve the problem that it can harass and be intended
to put us out of business.  If our customers are in the
-- let's imagine the following scenario -- and I, you
know, we are put in this position because they've come
up with this hypothetical -- these hypotheticals about
when it could be valid.
The officers see someone come into the
motel, and each time they see someone come into the
motel, they come in and say, hey, we're the police, let
us see the records.  The -- it really can interfere if
you just imagine --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think that's -- if you
had such a case-specific example, that might be one
thing.  But maybe it would help if you can tell me what
goes on in this pre-compliance judicial review.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So the hotel owner says,
sorry, you can't look at the registry, I want
pre-compliance judicial review.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is the nature of
that review?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The -- this Court has
considered that question in the Fair Labor Standards
Act, the context of the tax, the context -- and the
banking context, so California Bankers, Donovan, and Lone
Steer.  And what it has said is that the administrative
agent with the -- you know, the police officer, whoever
enforces the law -- don't have to go to a judge -- gives
a one-page subpoena.  Then there is an objection by the
business owner in any of these contexts, and remember,
in banking, these are records that the government
requires you to produce.
And then what happens is that the -- the --
what generally will be the rule, it's up to the city, is
that the city will put the onus on us to go to a judge.
And the fact that the onus is on us to go to a judge and
the fact that our objections are very limited, which is
to say, we only get to object that this is harassing or
for law enforcement, means that we almost always give
over the records because it's going to be a completely
futile objection.  But it is the prospect that we can go
to a judge that tells the beat cop that he needs to
behave and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And those are the only
objections that would be --
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- successful, harassment
and using this for law enforcement?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  That's detailed in
this Court's precedents including Barlow's, it is what
-- that's the rule of Camara and See.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How many of these Courts'
precedents involves a business that has been treated
like a public utility?  I mean, there are requirements
for hotels, how big the room has to be, how many people
you can put in the room, even in -- in many locations,
how much you can charge for the room.
The hotel owner is not like the -- like a
private business.  He is a regulated provider of -- of
public services that has traditionally been regulated
closely over the years.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The short answer -- the
first question you asked is, how many times have you
been asked that question.  The answer is none.  The
second answer to your question is that, but in the
relevant sense, which is to say how much of this
property is protected and private, is that
overwhelmingly hotels have constitutional protections.
Remember, 95 percent of this hotel is going
to be the guests' rooms, and unlike in cases like Berger
-- remember they go out and search the open junkyard,
unlike cases like Colonnade and Biswell where you
inspect the open stores or even go behind the scenes.
Here the police can't do it.  The Fourth Amendment,
everybody agrees, protects privacy at the hotel.  And so
there is a much greater expectation of privacy on our
part.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I think the question
that Justice Scalia is asking is, is there a reason to
think that hotels are a more heavily regulated industry
than all the other industries that we can think of?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.  I mean, just think
about it.  California Bankers and Miller are cases
involving banking.  Banking is incredibly heavily
regulated, you have to have a charter, the government
requires you to keep all kinds of records.  And in both
of those cases -- and remember, Justice Scalia, those
are the bank customers' records, they're about the bank
customers' transactions.
And what this Court said in both of those
cases is that with rare exceptions, like the $10,000
requirement, Title I of the Bank Secrecy Act is
constitutional because it requires a subpoena.  That is,
there is the prospect of getting a judge involved if the
Bank Secrecy requirement that the investigation is too
onerous.
I'll give you one other data point --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But innkeepers have been
regulated, not for decades, but they've been regulated
for centuries and they have -- they have duties to the
public that are enforceable.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I'm just puzzled by
this case.  You concede that the records have to be
kept.  There are very few reasons for keeping those
records other than law enforcement.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Ah, that we disagree with,
Justice Kennedy.  Remember we've kept these records and
innkeepers have kept these records for time immemorial.
We use these records for very different purposes.  They
are every record of our business transactions.  We use
this information to keep in touch with our customers.
Every business does.  It's quite proprietary
information.  And while it's the case that we --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Motel 6 does this?  Jeez,
I've never -- I've never received anything from them.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  My goodness.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  You may not be in their
frequent guest program --
(Laughter.)
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  But, nobody doubts --
remember, this is an ordinance that applies to the Four
Seasons and the Ritz-Carlton and everything else.
They've just carved out a very specific subset.
And, Justice Kennedy, while we are attentive
to the point that you can't -- we are not asserting and
the guests are not asserting Fourth Amendment rights
here, let's not lose sight of the fact that these
records can show very, very personal information.  Not
just the driver's license information, but whether you
stayed at a hotel during a religious or a political
convention --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Once again, you're not
complaining about the privacy interests of the guests.
That's not your complaint here.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Scalia, here’s the
point. We -- they agree this is a Fourth Amendment
search, point one.  Then what you are doing is if you
have to make an honest assessment of whether this
information really does further the Fourth Amendment
value of privacy.  And it does because this has private
stuff in it.  There's just no real dispute about that.
And I am sympathetic, Justice Kennedy, to
the fact that innkeepers have been regulated for a long
time.  I will simply say that in 99.4 percent of the
jurisdictions in this country, this is not the rule.
There are 100, but there are 18,000 other jurisdictions
in which this is not the rule and apparently has never
been the rule.
And the nature of that regulation isn't one
that, in the Burger sense, impinges on our sense of
privacy.  We have to take guests, but what does that
tell us about whether our records are private?  And
certainly, we can identify a huge array of other
businesses that are regulated.
The one data point that I wanted to make is
that in 2002, the Department of Justice did a study, and
it found that 335 different provisions of Federal law
use the system that I just described for you; and that
is, the subpoena first in order to get the records.  And
there's a bare handful of them, none of them involving
just bare records with the possible exception of the OCC
that use this exception that says, you never have to get
a judge involved.  It is the subpoenas --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  99.4 percent
jurisdictions, does that include -- are you comparing
the little hamlet in Indiana with Los Angeles or
New York?  Does New York City have something like this?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I don't know the answer to
the question of that particular city, but, Your Honor,
they're including big and small and so am I.  So there
are a lot of big cities that don't have this rule.
My point is this, Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- you're -- you're
saying, oh, the hotel has a private interest because it
wants to know who its customers.  But they can do that
by keeping their own record consensually.  You have
conceded that they can require the information as a
matter of law.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, that's because your
precedents say they can, Your Honor.  And my point is
this, because your precedents say --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that means it's true.
(Laughter.)
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well -- and hence, my answer
yes.
But my point is this:  Because they can do
it here, Justice Kennedy, they can do it everywhere.
The government can require any business to keep track of
all of its transactions and all of its customers.  And
if the government can then just say, all right, now,
give us all that information, then they've reduced the
Fourth Amendment to a nullity.
The final point I'll make is that don't be
confused with the idea that there's something special
about hotels.  The amount of government regulation here
is massive.  The reason that the deputy solicitor
general is here on behalf of the United States is that
there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
regulatory schemes the Federal government administers
where it is now required to use a subpoena.  But what
self-respecting regulator wouldn't love --
JUSTICE ALITO:  A subpoena -- a subpoena is
worthless when what is sought is something that can be
easily destroyed, hidden or falsified.  It's -- it's
very useful if you're trying to get complicated records
that can't be easily altered between the time when the
subpoena is issued and the time when the subpoena is
enforced.  But nobody -- nobody issues a subpoena for
the murder weapon that one is -- you know, that you
suspect is in somebody's house.
So these records are more like the murder
weapon where there's something that can be easily
falsified.  You -- you seem to concede when you say that
the police can seize them, then -- then the subpoena is
worthless.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Lone Steer says the opposite
with all respect, and that is, the records there are how
many hours did someone work at what amount of pay.  And
if you can't falsify that just as quickly as you can
falsify who's in room 2, then I just don't understand
the nature of recordkeeping.
The Court has insisted on this as a bare
constitutional minimum, both to keep the enforcement
officer in line and to let us know the enforcement
officer is kept in line.  It has not -- it has been
attentive to the fact that we don't want to put undue
burdens on the government and that is, it's just a
subpoena and that we have less than Fourth Amendment
rights.
JUSTICE ALITO:  You think -- you think
payroll records in general are no more complicated than
the ledger at a motel that runs by the hour?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  In the relevant respect,
Justice Alito, if the question is, did the person work
50 hours or 35 and the record says 50 -- the actual
record would be 30 -- 50 and I just want to fill in 35,
yes.  The -- the court didn't even think that that was a
remotely plausible argument in that -- the line of cases
that I'm describing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Four minutes, Mr. Rosenkranz.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Thank you, Your Honor.
Let me start with the facial point and then
circle back to the -- to the merits.  So as I hear
Mr. Goldstein describing the rule, the only objections
that are going to be raised are harassment and whether
this is for a legitimate purpose, but if that's the
concern, that's a classic as-applied challenge.
If a hotel has a cop coming up to them five
times a day, they come in and say, this is really
harassment.  These searches are inappropriate.  And if
the -- if it's the purpose of the officer, he's doing
criminal investigation rather than actually caring about
whether my records are complete, that is an as-applied
challenge.
Now, the plaintiffs have not even tried to
demonstrate that this ordinance is unconstitutional in
every circumstance.  On pages 19 to 20 of our brief, we
develop numerous scenarios, and Mr. Goldstein mentioned
only one of them.
So, for example, where the hotel is required
to upload the records to the police department every
day, it may not even be a search, but it's certainly
less intrusive.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's -- that's not
the statute.  I didn't understand those examples because
some of those examples, the police could act without
this -- without this.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Without this --
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So not that one, Your
Honor.  Justice Kennedy, not that one.  So some of
them -- in some of them, the ordinance has the purpose
of requiring someone to do something that they would not
otherwise have to submit to.  But the one that I just
gave as an example, the scenario of uploading the
documents rather than the police conducting a search on
the spot, is less intrusive.
And -- and the problem here is that the
plaintiffs have tried to invalidate every possible
application of this ordinance but they haven't done
the -- the intrusiveness, privacy, government interest
balance that one needs to do for each of them.
But let me then circle to the merits
because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm still very confused
about this.  There is always a potential exception to a
warrant, even a Fourth Amendment warrant of going into
the home, exigent circumstances, there's someone sick on
the other side, if there's a fleeing felon into the
place, but that doesn't eliminate the need for a
warrant.  It's not a tell-us-later issue.  Police can't
just keep going in and then fish around for an excuse.
That's a process issue.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Understood, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're entitled to a
warrant, you're entitled to a subpoena, you're
entitled -- that's what they're challenging, which is
they're not challenging all of the other reasons why the
police could go in legitimately --
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- with an exception to
the Fourth Amendment.  They're asking whether this kind
of search, generally, without all of those other exigent
circumstances or other Fourth Amendment exceptions is
constitutional.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Right, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is the process here
right?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Understood.
And so let's not talk about the exceptions.
Let's talk about another example where the motel
continues to keep the register in the open, like they
did for 100 years, and then snatches it away when the
police come.  That --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know something, but
that's a different issue.  It's in the public.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, right.  And they
would --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And how often do you
think that's going to happen?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  And for that reason, they
would have no expectation of privacy and the Fourth
Amendment calculus would be totally different.  But let
me -- let me --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but then it's not a
search at all.  And, once again, it's not this statute
that's doing the work.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, no, your Honor.  If
they snatch it away, it certainly is this ordinance that
is doing the work.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You're saying that they have
no expectation of privacy.  We wouldn't -- we wouldn't
say it's a search at all, and the police can take it
away.  It doesn't depend on this statute.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, no, exactly.  We
would -- we would win the Fourth Amendment case, but
they would -- but that has been invalidated by -- by
deciding this on a facial basis.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, our
questions intruded on your rebuttal time.  Why don't you
take an extra minute or so.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Thank you, Your Honor.
So let me just emphasize that this is a very
narrow rule that we're talking about.  We're talking
about a rule that is unlikely to be repeated in so many
of the other circumstances that have been discussed
today.
It's about an inspection of only a single
book of information that the government requires hotels
to maintain and that the -- that Mr. Goldstein has
admitted the government should -- can require hotels to
maintain.
It's in a context that is especially prone
to criminality.  People are using these hotels precisely
to commit crimes where the gaps are quite detectable in
real time but not detectable otherwise.
In an industry where there has been hundreds
of years of regulation including a history of
warrantless searches that are even broader at the time
of the founding, hotels were being searched with --
without warrants at the time of the founding and a
history of a hundred years of police inspections in Los
Angeles itself and even a hundred years of these things
being open to the public.
If the Court has no further questions, we
respectfully request that the Court reverse.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the
