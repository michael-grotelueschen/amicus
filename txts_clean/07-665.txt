CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 07-665, Pleasant Grove City
v. Summum.
Mr. Sekulow.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SEKULOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Tenth Circuit erred when it held that
the First Amendment Free Speech Clause forces Pleasant
Grove City to accept and erect on its property a private
party's donated, unattended, permanent monument.
The decision suffers from two constitutional
defects: First, the court's conclusion that a donated
Ten Commandments monument constitutes private speech
rather than Government speech is wrong. Here each of
the monuments on display in Pioneer Park have been
selected by the Government, are owned by the Government,
controlled by the Government, and are displayed on
Government property. When the Government is speaking,
it is free from the traditional free speech constraints
of the First Amendment.
Second, the court compounded its error by
further concluding that Pioneer Park is a traditional
public forum for the erection of permanent, unattended
monuments by private parties.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Sekulow, you're
really just picking your poison, aren't you? I mean,
the more you say that the monument is Government speech
to get out of the first, free speech -- the Free Speech
Clause, the more it seems to me you're walking into a
trap under the Establishment Clause. If it's Government
speech, it may not present a free speech problem, but
what is the Government doing speaking -- supporting the
Ten Commandments?
MR. SEKULOW: Well, the Ten Commandments
here was displayed in Pioneer Park, as the mayor said,
Mayor Cook, in 1971, to show the pioneer heritage of the
community. This was a community of pioneers on a quest
for religious liberty. That's why this town was
established. There is no Establishment Clause claim,
Mr. Chief Justice, here. It would be inconsistent with
the relief that the Respondents are really seeking.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --
MR. SEKULOW: And I think that -- yes,
Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't want to
interrupt your answer to the Chief Justice because I
think it's critical, critical to your argument. As a
procedural matter, I thought that the Establishment
Clause issue was raised in the initial complaint. Are
you taking the position it's now waived or something?
MR. SEKULOW: Well, there was no Federal
Establishment Clause complaint at all. There was a
State --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It was under the State?
MR. SEKULOW: It was under the State of
Utah's Establishment Clause. It was raised in the
complaint. It was not the basis upon which the
injunction was sought, and the Tenth Circuit noted that
it was waived.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you prevail, the action
should be dismissed, as far as you're concerned?
MR. SEKULOW: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.
MR. SEKULOW: Just let me --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then getting back to the
Chief Justice's point, it does seem to me that if you
say it's Government speech that in later cases,
including the case of the existing monument, you're
going to say it's Government speech and you have an
Establishment Clause problem. I don't know if -- I'm
not saying it would necessarily be resolved one way or
the other, but it certainly raises --
MR. SEKULOW: Well, I think from an --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- an Establishment Clause
problem.
MR. SEKULOW: If there was an Establishment
Clause claim, Justice Kennedy, which is not here, Van
Orden forecloses it. This monument is very similar to
what was at play in Van Orden. And here the city stated
the reason that they accepted and erected this monument,
accepted the donation from the Fraternal Order of
Eagles, was to show something and to represent their
pioneer heritage, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose it depends on
what the Government speech consists of, what it is the
Government is saying about the Ten Commandments. If the
Government is saying the Ten Commandments are the word
of God that's one thing, and if the Government is saying
the Ten Commandments are an important part of our
national heritage, that's something else.
MR. SEKULOW: That's -- and precisely,
Justice Scalia, that's exactly what Mayor Cook in fact,
at the unveiling ceremony, stated that this will serve
to remind citizens of their pioneer heritage and the
founding of --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have to --
MR. SEKULOW: -- their community --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the NEA -- Finley v.
NEA, the Court didn't treat that as Government speech.
MR. SEKULOW: Right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or am I -- is that the --
MR. SEKULOW: No. You're correct. Those
were speech selection cases. It think it clearly --
that the actions here of the Government, of the City
Council, falls neatly within Forbes, Finley, and the
plurality in American Library Association. The
Government --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before we get -- before
we get away from the Government, the Establishment
Clause, you said, well, Van Orden answered that, but did
it? Because you don't have here a 40-year history of
this monument being there, and nobody seems to be
troubled by it.
MR. SEKULOW: There is a 36-year history
here. This monument has been on display since 1971. So
this monument has been there a long time, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think 38 is the cut-off
point.
MR. SEKULOW: Is that the cut-off?
(Laughter.)
MR. SEKULOW: Perhaps I miscounted. It may
be 38.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Sekulow --
MR. SEKULOW: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- when you come
upon this, if somebody comes upon this monument in the
park, how are they supposed to tell whether it's
Government speech or private speech?
MR. SEKULOW: Well, of course the face of
it, Mr. Chief Justice, states on the face of the
monument that it's presented to Pleasant Grove City in
Utah County by the Fraternal Order of Eagles. As far as
a Government speech as far as ownership and control goes
under a Johanns analysis, different from Finley and
Forbes and that context, here the Government exercised
control. After all, they allowed it, accepted it, and
allowed it to be erected on their property. Under Utah
law, all right, title, and interest to that property
transferred.
But I would say with regard to the
endorsement, if you will, or the Establishment Clause
issue, really the context here, as this Court has
consistently stated within the Establishment Clause
cases matter -- this Court has a depiction of Moses
holding the Ten Commandment in the frieze of the
courtroom with the words written in Hebrew. That's not
--
an endorsement of the religion or of the commandments.
It's representative of the history.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the context of all
other lawgivers. This is a stand-alone Ten Commandments
and you don't see, I don't think, anywhere "I am the
Lord thy God." That's not shown.
MR. SEKULOW: No, the words on the Court's
frieze are "steal," "murder," "adultery" in Hebrew.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. SEKULOW: Very different in that
context. But as far as the actual language of what's
going on within the park itself, Justice Ginsburg, this
is not a monument standing alone. There are 15 other
displays in this Pioneer Park. It's called --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this a challenge to the
Ten Commandments monument?
MR. SEKULOW: It's not. This is not an
Establishment Clause case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought this case did not
involve an Establishment Clause challenge. Why are we
MR. SEKULOW: There is no Establishment
Clause. It's not a basis upon which the injunction was
sought, and the Tenth Circuit specifically held it was
waived.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Sekulow, can I just
ask: At what point in the litigation did you first
raise the Government speech argument?
MR. SEKULOW: At the Tenth Circuit. The
Tenth Circuit, the existing law in the Tenth Circuit in
the Summum line of cases mandated a private speech
determination, even if the speech was controlled or
known by the Government, if it originated with a third
party. As soon as we were before -- and under Tenth
Circuit rules that's binding, of course, on the district
court and on the panel.
But even in the panel brief, we raise the
issue of Government speech and the Court addressed it
both as to -- and, Justice Kennedy, going back to your
point -- both as to Government speech and to the speech
selection cases of Forbes, Finley, and American Library
Association. And I think that those cases as well point
to what's at issue here. Governments in the business of
governing and determining the parks and the landscape of
the parks make these kind of decisions.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the tough -- isn't
the tough issue here not so much whether there is
Government speech. I will assume and I do indeed assume
that there is. Isn't the tough issue here the claim
that there is -- is in fact a mixture, that it is both
Government and private. And the argument for its
continuing to be private speech I take it is simply the
Eagles identification with the presentation and their
espousal of what the monument says. How -- how do you
think we ought to deal with the mixture issue.
MR. SEKULOW: Well, I think the fact that it
originated, that the monument originated by the Eagles
as a third party, doesn't in any way take away from the
fact that in this particular case, and in most cases
involving donated monuments, which, as the United States
would point to, most of the monuments in parks are
donated by or originated with third parties --
JUSTICE SOUTER: They probably are, but most
of them -- and you correct me if I'm wrong here. But I
don't suppose that most of them -- most of them contain
as part of -- in a prominent place in the monument
itself contain the statement that, you know, this is the
gift of or the position of or what-not of X, Y or Z,
whereas this monument does.
MR. SEKULOW: Most of them, Justice Souter,
do actually have statements. In fact, a perfect example
would be at Gettysburg National Military Park a number
of those monuments, most of them, are donated by or
originated by third parties. They'll often say "Donated
by," for instance, "the Father Corby --
JUSTICE SOUTER: We may have more cases
coming.
MR. SEKULOW: I hope not.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But tell me, what is the
criterion that we should use to decide what the
significance of the private identification is?
MR. SEKULOW: I think the key should be, as
this Court alluded to in Johanns, the issue of control,
who controls the message ultimately here. And the fact
is the Statue of Liberty originated by the
Franco-American Union -- was originated by a third
party. The United States by resolution accepted it. At
that point title transfer.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If that -- if we accept
that there is Government speech, I think Justice
Souter's question is isn't this really the Government
endorsement of the Eagles' message? I mean, the Eagles
are all over this monument, their symbol of the eagle,
and the Eagles want it to be known that this is their
monument. Indeed, I think in Van Orden wasn't the -- in
the district court there, wasn't the statement, well,
this -- Texas did this in recognition of the good work
that the Eagles do in preventing -- - help try to
prevent juvenile delinquency.
MR. SEKULOW: Right. And I think that
actually points to why that once it's controlled and
owned by the Government the fact that it originated in
the third party, Justice Ginsburg, changes the equation
for ownership and control to the Government.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if it does, it
changes it, as I understand your answer, by eliminating
the private aspect of the speech. So that your real
answer to me is it's not a mixture.
MR. SEKULOW: It's not.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And there ceases to be a
mixture the moment the Government accepts it.
MR. SEKULOW: Once -- right, title, and
interest vest under Utah law in the Pleasant Grove City
upon acceptance and at that point it is owned and
controlled by the city. And the fact that it was
originally created -- and Justice Ginsburg, you're
correct, the district court and also the court of
appeals in Van Orden stated that it was originated as a
moral guidance for youth. That was the reason that the
Fraternal Order of Eagles developed. The State of Texas
said: We're going to honor the Eagles. That was their
reason, as well as showing the role of the Ten
Commandments and the rule of law. And then the Third --
excuse me, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you question
that's kind of in the background of the case?
MR. SEKULOW: Sure.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Assume you didn't have the
policy that you do have, but it was perfectly clear that
the city decided not to put up this monument because it
disagreed with the message of the monument. Whether you
call it Government speech or private speech, would that
be permissible?
MR. SEKULOW: It wouldn't be a First
Amendment free speech claim. It might raise an
establishment clause, an equal protection kind of clause
analysis case, but not under the basis upon which
Respondents have sought here. I think that's important
to point out. The basis upon which they sought access,
in you will, is a species of an equal access claim. But
of course our position is the Government hasn't
established anything by accepting the monument.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, Justice Stevens's
question is important, maybe not for your case but for
other cases. We are deciding this for other cases to
arise, and why isn't he correct that if you don't like
the message then that raises a content-based claim?
MR. SEKULOW: Because if the Government is
speaking, if it's the Government's message, they're of
course allowed to engage in content-based statements.
The Statute of Liberty was a statement of liberty
enlightening the world. I could give a list of
monuments that do that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand that.
MR. SEKULOW: That's what they did.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it doesn't seem to me
that you have to make the Government speech argument for
you to make the argument that you just made.
MR. SEKULOW: No, not necessarily, because
even under the speech selection cases -- I mean, that's
correct -- Governments make determinations of what they
are going to put in their parks to communicate a
message. That's very different from a situation I think
where the Tenth Circuit panel was incorrect and
Respondents are incorrect: They confuse the issue of
the Government actually creating a forum or a venue for
speech -- and a perfect example of that would be here,
with ownership and control vesting in the city. Very
different in that situation than the typical equal
access case, where the Government merely opens up its
facilities for a variety of viewpoints, Justice Stevens,
and then cannot engage in content-based or
viewpoint-based --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So the city, in effect, if
the city says, we are going to have a designated
ten-acre field in which anybody can put up a monument,
but you can't because we don't like your message,
there's a First Amendment problem. But if the city
hides the ball in effect and says in effect, we'll --
we'll let monuments be placed on -- we will accept
monuments from people who want to place them on our
property if the monuments have some kind of an arguable
historical connection or a connection with people with
long association with the community, as long as they
have that sort of criterion in mind then they can select
any way they want to?
MR. SEKULOW: Justice Souter, there is a
fundamental difference between opening up a forum,
taking acres of a park and saying everybody gets to go
in, and another situation where the Government is
clearly controlling it not for a subversive reason. And
I think the evidence in these cases, in these series of
cases, pointing to Justice Kennedy's concern about what
does it mean for future cases, here it is
uncontroverted: The basis upon which the preliminary
injunction ultimately was issued by the Tenth Circuit
disregarded or at least cast doubt on the declaration of
the park administrator, who had been involved in city
government since 1972, who stated -- and it can be found
on pages 102 through 104 of the joint appendix -- that
it's been the practice of Pleasant Grove City for three
decades to accept displays only in their particular case
related to the history of the community, its pioneer
history. -
JUSTICE SCALIA: It goes to the same thing,
doesn't it? I mean, whether it's the Government stating
the message or whether it's the Government creating a
limited public forum for the presentation of only those
messages that it thinks are important, it comes to the
same thing, doesn't it?
MR. SEKULOW: Well, it depends on -- if it's
a limited public forum, certainly limited public forums
can be based on subject matter and speaker identity.
This Court said that, said that consistently, Cornelius
and Perry. So in that context, and now that limited
public forum appears to be more of a non-public forum
type of analysis, certainly. Even in the designated
public forum, it could be limited in that regard.
I think that points to the confusion of what
took place here. The Court in our view conflated those
two issues, the issue of forum and Government speech.
And while they're both separate basis upon which we
believe the Tenth Circuit opinion could be reversed and
vacate the issuance of the injunction, the reality is
that in this particular case once title passed and
control vested in Pleasant Grove City they were the
owner and effectively controlled. And, Mr. Chief
Justice, that does not mean that they violate the
Establishment Clause simply because they own and control
a monument.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you a question
to make sure I understand your position. It would have
been permissible for the city to say, our park it filled
with monuments and we are only going to let those in who
convey messages that we agree with?
MR. SEKULOW: If the policy is --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If that's a policy.
MR. SEKULOW: If the policy is that we're
only going -- that the Government's controlling those
messages, it's not individual private expression, of
course. If it's individual private -- if the
Government, on the other hand, were to say --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But really, in this case
sort of the debate as to whether the policy
justifications for the monument are a sham are not are
really irrelevant?
MR. SEKULOW: From a legal standpoint on
Government speech, it's irrelevant. On the factual --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it's a Government
forum for private speech, I think it's the same thing.
You're defining -- you define the forum to include only
those -- the forum is putting up monuments. You just
put up those monuments that agree with the message.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the same question
Justice Stevens had, just to tack onto his question
here, your answer was: Oh, well, the Government owns
it. Suppose the Government says: We will accept
ownership only if we agree with the message. That just
puts his question. I think the ownership argument is --
is not an answer to the Justice's question.
MR. SEKULOW: It's not ownership, Justice
Kennedy, in and of itself. Ownership is an indicator, a
factor for control, but it is control of the message.
When the Government implanted that monument donated by
the Fraternal Order of Eagles, they were sending a
message. It was not a message of "I am the lord thy
God" --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Nothing could be a more
obvious control of the message than the criterion that
says we will decide in -- in determining to accept it or
not, we will decide on the basis of whether we agree
with the message. That is control with a vengeance.
MR. SEKULOW: The difference is -- the
difference between each of those cases and the case here
is the Fraternal Order of Eagles surrendered control of
their message and their speech. In the typical equal
access case, Justice Stevens, they do not.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they -- they do in
the example Justice Kennedy just raised and the example
that I just raised. The Eagles come along say: Here's
the monument; take it; it's all yours.
MR. SEKULOW: Which happened here.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And the -- the Government
says: Okay, we'll take the Eagles monument. We will
not on identical terms take the Summum monument because
we disagree with the message. At the point they make
the decision they don't own anything. What they are
doing is controlling, in your words, and they are
controlling on the basis of agreement with the message.
Why isn't that a First Amendment violation?
MR. SEKULOW: It's not a First Amendment
violation because the Government takes ownership and
control at the time it's displayed, and there is no
dispute at the time it's displayed that the Government
is conveying a message.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But we've got -- we've got
to shut our eyes to the period prior to the moment title
passes.
MR. SEKULOW: Absolutely not, because
discovery in this case proves the fact that this has
been a policy in existence for three decades. And the
fact of the matter is under that analysis --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Does that mean if we engage
in viewpoint discrimination for three decades, we are
home free?
MR. SEKULOW: If the Government is the
speaker, they are certainly entitled to do that. If
they are not, that would be a very different scenario.
JUSTICE SOUTER: It wouldn't be a speaker on
your view until it takes control of the monument.
MR. SEKULOW: But the Government -- the
speech selection itself is an independent basis under
Forbes, Finley, and American Library Association to
bring these kind of --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But those are cases in
which, to begin with, the Government is engaging in -- a
process of, in effect, sponsoring speech. And here we
-- we have not, I think, reached the point in which the
public park is to be analogized either with a
publication or a magazine or -- or grants to -- to the
arts.
MR. SEKULOW: I think, when it comes to the
issue of selecting monuments for its park, it's very
similar to a museum curator or the arts.
Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the
remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Sekulow.
Mr. Joseffer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Of course the Government can select the
content and viewpoint of monuments on the National Mall
and in other public parks across the country. The
Vietnam Veterans Memorial did not open us up to a Viet
Cong memorial. When the Martin Luther King Memorial is
completed on the mall, it will not have to be offset by
a monument to the man who shot Dr. King.
JUSTICE ALITO: Can't there be a situation
where the Government does create a monument that is a --
a limited public forum? Let's take the example that you
just gave, the Vietnam War Memorial. I presume the
Government could not refuse to have the names of certain
deceased soldiers on that monument because it disagreed
with certain ideas that they had espoused at one point
or another.
MR. JOSEFFER: Well, if -- when it is
Government speech -- for example, we can have a -- a
Washington Monument and a Jefferson Memorial without an
Adams one. I mean, we do get to decide who we want to
memorialize on the mall because it's Government speech.
But there are also -- there are two legal
theories here. The first is that this is Government
speech. The second is that this -- even if it was
private speech, this would be one of those unusual
contexts like public broadcasting, museums, libraries,
where normal forum principles do not apply because the
Government is acting as a curator and value judgments
are, therefore, both inevitable and appropriate.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What's the answer to
Justice Alito's question?
MR. JOSEFFER: I mean, if we wanted --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, supposing the
Government in the Vietnam Memorial decided not to put up
the names of any homosexual soldiers. Would that be
permissible?
MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. When the -- when the
Government is speaking, it can choose who to memorialize
and who not --
JUSTICE BREYER: That seems to be the
problem here. And what I have in this is the -- the
problem I have is that we seem to be applying these
subcategories in a very absolute way. Why can't we call
this what it is -- it's a mixture of private speech with
Government decisionmaking -- and ask the question, as we
do in election cases, is the restriction proportionate
to a legitimate objective? I know how you're going to
answer that question. You're going to say: Of course,
it is.
But what's interesting me is, are we bound
in these cases to apply what I think of as an artificial
kind of conceptual framework or are we free to ask what
seems to me to be at the heart of the matter? The
answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetically is: Of
course the Government can't do that because it's
disproportionate.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't get the answer.
Did you --
MR. JOSEFFER: Yes, the Government can
choose to memorialize who it wants on the mall. When
the Government is -- now, to be clear, that's under the
Free Speech Clause.
JUSTICE BREYER: So what is the answer to
the -- what is the answer to Justice Stevens's
hypothetical? What is the answer to the homosexual
hypothetical? What is the answer?
MR. JOSEFFER: The only question --
JUSTICE BREYER: Because that tests the
theory.
MR. JOSEFFER: Well, as a matter of the Free
Speech Clause, there are no limits on the Government's
ability to speak freely. Under the Equal Protection
Clause, the Establishment Clause, perhaps the Due
Process Clause, there might be thought to be independent
checks on the Government's speech. But the Free Speech
Clause, whatever else it does, does not prevent the
Government from speaking freely.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me the
Government could disfavor homosexuality just as it could
disfavor abortion, just as it can disfavor a number of
other things that in -- in many States people are free
to do. The Government can disfavor all of it, can't it?
MR. JOSEFFER: The Government would be
powerless to do anything if it cannot first formulate
and then express its own viewpoints.
JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that the answer to
the -- the question? Why isn't the answer to the
question that monuments generally are not -- the
erection of monuments generally are not a forum? There
is a fundamental difference between the speaker's corner
in the park where anybody can speak and a permanent
monument that takes up space, presumably limited public
space.
And if you have the unusual situation where
you are have a monument that is really analogous to a
forum, then the forum analysis would be applicable. But
to apply it to something like the Washington Monument or
the Jefferson Memorial is ridiculous.
MR. JOSEFFER: When the -- when the
Government -- and this is a point I started on earlier.
When the Government is acting as a curator as in the
museum context, normal forum principles do not apply.
In Forbes, for example, this Court held that
when the Government acts as a public broadcaster it
normally can engage in viewpoint discrimination outside
of an exception for candidate debates. And the -- and
the same point applies here to monuments, I think, for a
combination of three reasons.
First, the Government has an overwhelming
interest as a property owner in not being saddled with
structures it does not want; second, the limits on the
availability of public space you refer to; and, third,
the Government's sovereign interest in using monuments
on its own property to tell its own story, as the
Federal Government has done here on the Mall.
It's similar to, for example, a sculpture
--
garden or -- and -- a sculpture garden where the
Government can choose what sculptures to put in the
sculpture garden without necessarily having some
overriding theme or overriding reason.
If I could give two examples of that, in
Meridian Hill Park here in Northwest D.C., between 15th
and 16th streets, the Government chose to accept and
place a variety of privately donated structures that
have no evident connection to one another. They cover
people as diverse as Joan of Arc, President Buchanan --
JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose they only
accept Democrats who are sculptors, and they reject all
the Republicans?
MR. JOSEFFER: Right. As a matter of policy
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what in the First
Amendment -- are you saying the First Amendment would
not stop that?
MR. JOSEFFER: The Free Speech Clause on its
own force does not prevent the Government from speaking
freely. But as a matter of rational basis review under
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, It is hard to see
how the Government would have a legitimate governmental
interest in pure partisan activity.
But the Free Speech Clause, what it does is
that it -- it limits the extent to which the Government
can regulate other people's speech.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under the Equal
Protection Clause would -- if you wrote an Equal
Protection Clause opinion, you would end up saying it's
content-based. That's the First Amendment.
MR. JOSEFFER: If it's Government speech,
though --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't think that
can you avoid the hard part by saying, oh, other
amendments of the Constitution might apply. The heart
of the question is whether the Government may
discriminate based on content, and that's a First
Amendment question.
MR. JOSEFFER: But when the Government is
speaking or when the Government is acting as a curator
as with a museum or a sculpture garden or a library or
here, the Government is absolutely entitled to make both
content and viewpoint-based distinctions. Otherwise,
you get the absurd result --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not only absolutely
entitled, it has to do so. It -- it has no choice, does
MR. JOSEFFER: Right. If we -- if we
couldn't formulate and express viewpoints, I would be
here today in support of neither party. And the
Government, frankly, would be prevented from doing much
of anything.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't run a museum if
you have to accept everything, right?
MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. Now, yes -- I mean --
yes, if it's just the simple point that we can do
content and viewpoint discrimination in this context.
And Forbes recognized that when the Government -- even
if it's private speech, Forbes recognizes that as a
curator we can do this. An example, though, of the
question --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the law always
require us to adopt an all-or-nothing position? Aren't
there some extreme cases indicated by the hypothetical
where the First Amendment does enter in? Do we have to
decide this case that it's all or nothing?
MR. JOSEFFER: Of course, the Court could
put limits on its holding if it so desired.
But if I could address the, sort of the
hybrid speech which seems to worry some people. The
Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a great example. People
are permitted there to put private objects next to the
wall. That's clearly authorized speech. It's
authorized public speech. But at the end of the day,
the Government comes around, takes it away, puts the
nonperishable objects in a Government warehouse, and
then decides which of them to display in the
Smithsonian's American History Museum.
So what starts off as public speech -- or as
private speech, clearly becomes Government speech when
the Government assumes control over it. It's the same
as the Government putting a painting --
JUSTICE SOUTER: It would be -- the
trouble --
MR. JOSEFFER: -- in a Government museum.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I see your point, but the
trouble with that as an argument here is the private
part of the speech is just as much chiseled in stone as
the public part. So it's not going to go away at the
end of the day, and there isn't any way that the
Government in effect can engage in the gesture of saying
all private speech is treated the same way, whatever way
that might be. So we've got a -- we've got a -- we've
got a more difficult problem here.
MR. JOSEFFER: But if the Government -- take
a museum. The Government could choose or not choose to
put, say, a Gilbert Stuart painting that has a favorable
portrayal of a former president on display. The
Government didn't paint it. It has Gilbert Stuart's
name all over it. But when the Government chooses to
put that in a -- in a display, it's the Government that
is speaking, and the Government, therefore, has an
absolute right to decide its own speech. That should
become --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What you are, in effect,
saying -- and this may be -- I don't mean I think this
is necessarily the wrong answer -- but you're, in
effect, saying, yes, you can find instances of
Government speech in which there is clearly a -- a
private identification consistent with it, but the only
appropriate analysis is the analysis for government
speech. You can't have it both ways, you've got to pick
one or the other; and it is -- it is the Government
aspect which controls the First Amendment purposes.
That, I take it, is your answer?
MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. And when we are talking
about physical objects that constitute the speech,
that's oftentimes the case in museums, sculpture
gardens, parks across the country. So, frankly, there
is -- there is nothing even unusual about it. And the
reason is that all the free speech clause does --
JUSTICE SOUTER: There is nothing unusual
about it, but we haven't had this kind of a challenge
before. So, I -- I guess it still rests on you to say
why should we submerge the private part to the
Government part. There may be a very good reason, but I
want to know what your reason is.
MR. JOSEFFER: It's simply that once the
Government is speaking, it is the one -- it turns on
control, right? So once the Government takes control of
something, says this is our speech, then it's the
Government speaking. And here, I mean, it does --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe they can't do
it in museums, either. I mean, yes, we've been doing
this for a couple of hundred years, but maybe we've been
wrong all along and maybe the Government can't run
museums. It's possible, right? It's a brave new world.
MR. JOSEFFER: And frankly, public parks are
no less absurd, because we've been doing it in public
parks for probably at least as long as well. And in
fact, there are thousands of privately donated monuments
and sculptures in public parks across the country, and I
suspect a great many of them don't have some formal
disclaimer on them saying "I am the United States and I
approve this message." That's not the way that
Government speech has ever been thought to work.
The question, though, with Government speech
turning on control, this is the easy case because we
have a physical object that Government has both legal
and physical custody over. It chooses to display it,
and then it can do whatever it wants with it. It can
move it, modify it, destroy it, drop it to the bottom of
the ocean, sell it on eBay. So you'll never get a
better example of control, which this Court held in
Johanns is the touchstone for Government speech that's
not subject to the free speech clause.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Harris.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA HARRIS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. HARRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, may it
please the Court:
The city here gave the Eagles access to its
public park for s display about the Ten Commandments and
it denied Summum access for a display about the tenets
of its faith. That's a violation of the core free
speech principle that the Government may not favor one
message over another in a public forum. The Eagles
display here is not Government speech. The city had
nothing to do with the Ten Commandments Monument.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You say in a public forum.
I mean, that sort of begs the question. I mean, that --
that encapulates your -- your -- encapsulates your
answer. Has the -- has the city allowed anybody to put
up a monument there willy-nilly?
I mean, a public forum, as you know, we can
have praise in the park, we can have protest. Anybody
can do it, so long as you get a license and you're not
interfering with some other group. That's a public
forum. Has this city said anybody can put up a monument
in this park?
MS. HARRIS: Justice Scalia, there is a very
serious factual question in this case about whether the
city ever had a bona fide selection policy for this
park. But putting that to one side for a moment, a
public park is a public forum. A monument in a park may
be a mode of communication for that forum --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a public forum for
some things. Is it a public forum for everything? It
may be a public forum for processions, for parades. But
it is a public -- is it a public forum for anybody
constructing a monument?
MS. HARRIS: If you look at the question
that way, Justice Scalia, it might be said that a public
park is not a forum for sound trucks, it's not a forum
for sleep-ins, it's not a forum for news racks.
What that means is that there is no
unfettered right to engage in those forms of
communication. But if the Government allows it all --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Those are time, place, and
manner regulations, with which we are all familiar. But
my concern is that this -- this case is an example of
the tyrannies -- of the tyranny of labels. Because it's
a public forum, as Justice Scalia indicated, for
parades, for protests, which are limited temporally,
it -- it -- it just seems wooden and rigid to say to all
of a sudden say, well, it's a public forum for something
that will last 30 years for which there is only limited
space. It just doesn't make common sense.
MS. HARRIS: And that is exactly why,
Justice Kennedy, the city, any city, is permitted to
make a decision that it will close its public parks to
all unattended displays. The Court said that in
Pinette. It said that earlier in Vincent. But Because
there --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How far do you push
that? I mean, what about the hypotheticals on the other
side? I mean, you have a Statue of Liberty; do we have
to have a statue of despotism? Or do we have to put any
president who wants to be on Mount Rushmore? How do you
answer those?
MS. HARRIS: Of course not, is how I answer
that, Mr. Chief Justice.
Any city has available to it two very
straightforward options for dealing with this question
if by some happenstance they do have a monument on
public land that is not now a Government monument. The
first thing they can do is adopt any existing monuments
as Government speech converts them.
JUSTICE SOUTER: How do they do that? What
is the -- you mentioned that frequently in your brief,
and I'm not sure what formality you have in mind when
you say adopt.
MS. HARRIS: Governments can do it different
ways, Justice Souter. The way the national Government
does it under the Antiquities Act of 1906 is they
formally designate pre-existing structures as a monument
of the United States or a memorial of the United States.
And that, by the way, Mr. Chief Justice, is
the response to the Statue of Liberty problem. In 1924
it was so designated.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it's frozen into
time. Everything up until now is okay, but anything
going forward is not?
MS. HARRIS: I'm not sure I understand.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought you
said the Government can accept what's there and say
that's our speech. But you're challenging the ability
to do that going forward.
MS. HARRIS: No. No, Your Honor. If the
Government accepts what's there -- what is there now and
says that's ours, then they can say we are not taking --
we have closed this forum to private speech, these parks
are available only to Governmental displays.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The other side says that
some of these monuments, especially in the Civil War
battlegrounds, do indeed show who the donors are.
MS. HARRIS: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- Mr. Sekulow says
that some of these monuments, notably those in the Civil
War battlefields, do show who the donors are.
Now is that Government speech or private
speech?
MS. HARRIS: It depends if they were
privately formulated and handed off to the Government as
a completed object, they are only Government speech if
the Government has since then converted them --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So they have to go?
MS. HARRIS: -- by adopting them. They
don't have to go.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now that the Government
converted them, it passes a law saying, what, we -- we
adopt this?
MS. HARRIS: That has happened.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it enough that the
Government accepts ownership of it and places it on the
Government's property? Isn't that a manifestation of
the Government's adoption of it?
MS. HARRIS: Let me answer both of your
questions, Justice Scalia. The way it does that even if
they -- even if a monument makes clear that it was
privately formulated, a Government can still adopt it as
its own speech. It can put --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So this case -- your claim
would disappear if this town in Utah had passed an
ordinance saying we adopt the Ten Commandments Monument?
MS. HARRIS: It would, Justice Souter. We
would no longer have an equal access right going
forward --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's -- I mean, if
that's all that's involved here, we're engaging in kind
of a -- almost a silly exercise in formality.
MS. HARRIS: Absolutely not, Justice Souter.
And the reason we know it's not a formality is because
the city here refuses to do it. If it were just a
formality, they would check the box. They won't do
it --
JUSTICE SOUTER: If we tell them you have
got to take the monument down if they don't do it, don't
you think they are going to pass that pretty quick?
MS. HARRIS: I don't think they are, Justice
Souter. And I think it would be partly a concern about
establishment clause exposure, which we already heard
about today.
I think that there are substantive reasons
why they might not want to adopt one version of the Ten
Commandments as the city's own speech. As it happens,
the version of the Ten Commandments on the Eagles
monument isn't even the Mormon version of the Ten
Commandments. That might raise sensitivities in this
town. And whenever the Government adopts one version of
the exodus account, that is not legally sensitive but
politically sensitive as well.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what you mean
by adopting one version. If it's adopting the version
by saying these Ten Commandments are the word of God,
that's one thing. If it's adopting it by just saying
this is a version of the Ten Commandments that has had a
very significant place in the history of the American
people.
MS. HARRIS: I think that those are --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't care what
version it was if that's all they're doing.
MS. HARRIS: Those are very different --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Nor would the Mormons in
Utah, I think.
MS. HARRIS: Well, those are very different
for establishment clause purposes, Justice Scalia. But
the only way the Government can be adopting anything in
this context is by saying through the act of selection
we have adopted it. And the problem with that is that
the Government is not allowed to select which private
speech it wishes to present to the public in a public
park.
It can do that. It can do that in museums.
It can do it in libraries. It can do it --
JUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you this
example. Just by chance yesterday I was taking a walk
in a little neighborhood park , and I saw that there was
a monument -- a small monument, donated, and it says
right on there donated by a private neighborhood
association to commemorate a number of people who were
killed in the 9-11 attack on the Pentagon. And now if I
searched the town records or the county record and I
don't find any resolution saying they adopted this
monument as their monument, does that mean that if I
would like to put up a monument in the park to
commemorate loved ones who died, or people who I
respect, I have a First Amendment right to do that?
MS. HARRIS: No, Your Honor, and really for
three separate reasons. First of the all, it may be
that the Government -- even privately donated monuments
often involve a great deal of Government involvement at
the front end, when they are created. Government often
works in partnership with private donors to create the
content of that monument.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well what if the situation
is a neighborhood association prepared this; they said
we'd like to display it in the park; and the county or
the town says fine, go ahead and do it?
MS. HARRIS: Even under those more usual
circumstances there would be two things the city could
do to keep you out of their park. As I said, they could
adopt the monument that is there. The other thing any
city can do is adopt some kind of a content-neutral ban,
or a content-neutral limit, on the number of private
displays it wants to have in its park.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Harris, we -- we need a
clear rule here. We -- we can't expect the courts or
the cities for that matter to investigate in every case
what the degree of the Government's involvement in
the -- and what is the degree, 50 percent, 45 percent,
years? I mean, we are going to make up a percentage?
That's -- that's not the way threshold constitutional
questions ought to be resolved or resolvable. We need a
clear rule that the cities can rely on.
MS. HARRIS: I agree that we need a clear
rule, and if clarity is important here the easiest way
for the Government to make clear that it has adopted a
privately formulated message as its own is to adopt it
clearly and publicly. It can put up a plaque; it can
designate it a city monument.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there an historical
basis for that, or you just made it up? You think it
would be a good idea? I mean, if that had been the
practice over the past 200 years for all of these
monuments that -- that, you know, are strewed across the
landscape, then I'd say yes, that's probably what the
difference is.
But I'm not aware that there is any such --
such requirement and any such practice on the part of
Government. You're -- you're creating a new world.
MS. HARRIS: I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It may be a very nice world
but it happens not to be the world under which our
Constitution has subjected this country.
MS. HARRIS: If this is uncommon, that is
because usually the Government does reserve monuments
for governmental speech, monuments that it helps to
create or monuments that it is happy to endorse after
the fact. If this case is unusual, it's because
Pleasant Grove has done an unusual thing here by
allowing a private party to erect a permanent monument
in its park, even though it is not willing to endorse
the content of that monument.
And I do want to say that although clear
rules are necessary, whatever the particular details of
how a monument came to be on public land, there are
these two clear safe harbors for any city facing that
problem. Adopt it now or enact a content-neutral limit
on the number of monuments in the park; and we think the
city could do that on a going-forward basis. It could
say we have room -- for aesthetic reasons, for space
constraint reasons, We would like --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So that's all right, the
first 95 monuments, whoever -- whoever put them up,
okay? It's a monument to chocolate chip cookies or
whatever else, is that it? First 95?
MS. HARRIS: Sure. A city could say we
think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a practical
solution to the problem?
MS. HARRIS: Absolutely, because any city
confronting this problem now can look at its park and
say we have four monuments --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying the last
generation had much more freedom than the present one?
MS. HARRIS: I'm saying that as long as it
does it on a content-neutral basis, because it is
genuinely concerned about aesthetics, space constraints,
clutter in its parks, a city can enact a ban or a limit
on the number of displays; and if that has the effect of
grandfathering in existing displays --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to -- your
basic premise is this is a public forum, in any and all
instances; and we do have, certainly in the speech area,
demonstration area, from time immemorial public parks
have been places where people can speak their minds.
But I don't know of any tradition that says people can
come to the park with monuments and put them up if they
will, so long as they meet the equivalent of time, place
and manner.
So you're making an assumption that from
time immemorial, monuments, just like speeches, can be
presented by anyone who wants to.
MS. HARRIS: No, Justice Ginsburg.
Monuments are different from speeches and because
monuments are different, the Court has held that unlike
oratory, a city can decide to close its parks entirely
to all private unattended displays. It could not say,
"We've heard enough speeches; no more speeches." It can
say no private --
JUSTICE SOUTER: If that -- it that is so,
what is the point of using the public forum analysis at
all?
MS. HARRIS: Because here the city has not
done that. The city has not closed -- it has not made
the decision that it will bar all private unattended
displays.
JUSTICE SOUTER: That -- that may mean that
you have the foundation for a -- a speech discrimination
argument --
MS. HARRIS: That --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- but that would not be
the answer if we were dealing with a -- a traditional
public forum in -- in the sense that the Court's cases
have used the term.
MS. HARRIS: Oh, I think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So it seems to me that your
use of public forum is just by kind of remote analogy
here, and I -- I'm not sure that it's helping you or
would help us if we used it as criterion for decision.
MS. HARRIS: Oh, I think it may be helpful,
Justice Souter, because once we know that we are talking
about a public forum, we know that access cannot be
limited on a content basis.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your -- you can
stick with it as long as you want; that's what the --
the Tenth Circuit did, but suppose that we were to say
that we were unconvinced by the comparison between
speeches and parades on the one hand and monuments on
the other, so we did not apply the public forum analogy.
Would that be the end of your case?
MS. HARRIS: Oh, no, Justice Kennedy. Even
outside a public forum, in any context -- even in a
museum or library -- in any context in which the
Government is regulating private speech, it may not act
in a way that is designed to suppress one particularly
disfavored message or view; and we think that's what
happened here. As I said earlier --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it does
all the time. The -- you don't get equal time -- the
cigarette companies don't get equal time because the
Government says the Surgeon General has determined it is
bad for your health. It always suppresses alternative
viewpoints.
MS. HARRIS: When the Government is speaking
for itself, then the Government does have a right to
prefer certain viewpoints over others, but here the city
has consistently refused to adopt the content of this
monument as its own, and it is still disclaiming
endorsement of that monument. The city here -- the
justification for that Government speech exception is
that sometimes, as the United States has said, the
Government is entitled to speak in its own voice to
promote its own messages, its own policies. But it says
it's not doing that here.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You will say just the
opposite when you come back here to challenge the Ten
Commandments monument on -- on Establishment Clause
grounds. You will say something like this: Anybody who
comes into this park and seeing this monument owned by
the Government, on Government land, will think that the
Government is endorsing this message.
That's what you will say now.
MS. HARRIS: Um --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now why would it be true
there, but it's not true here? Would anybody think that
on public land owned by the Government the Government
disagrees with this message?
MS. HARRIS: Justice Scalia, for one thing,
if this case were being litigated under the
Establishment Clause, it wouldn't be critical whether
the monument were actually Government speech, because
the Establishment Clause can be implicated by the
Government's interaction with private speech as well.
That said, I do not think it's the case that anybody who
came across this monument would know that the Government
is speaking.
The monument says it is presented by the
Eagles. It has the Eagles emblem. The mayor himself
testified in his deposition that he thought the monument
was owned by the city, because it's the Eagles and not
the -- I'm sorry; was owned by the Eagles, because it is
the Eagles and not the city that maintains that
monument.
I think there is a very real question about
what people would think here and if those perceptions
are important the easy way to clarify it is for the city
to step up and adopt the monument as Government speech,
which it won't do here.
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't merely allowing the
monument to be built on public property sufficient
acceptance? If somebody came up to you and said I'd
like to put up a monument in your front yard, and you
said sure go ahead, do that, aren't you accepting
that -- whatever the monument says, in a sense?
MS. HARRIS: Your Honor, my front yard is
different from a public park, and that matters because
when all the Government has done is said sure, go ahead,
put your monument in our park, that's all the Government
ever does when it administers access to a public forum.
If it's doing it on a content basis, that's a problem.
The Government --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it doesn't -- it
doesn't have to do that, say, for time place and manner
restrictions for access to a public forum if it really
is a public forum. There is something more involved
here.
This is closer to the case of the individual
who says sure, put the McCain sign on -- on my lawn. No
one is going to doubt that the person whose house is
there is in favor of McCain; and -- and it seems to me
we are in the same situation with the monument in the
city.
MS. HARRIS: Again, I think because it's a
public park and because public forums are always used
for the expression of -- of ideas that the Government
does not necessarily agree with --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but when you get the
monument --
MS. HARRIS: -- the perceptions will not be
clear.
--
JUSTICE SOUTER: We do not -- there is no
pervasive understanding or non-pervasive one, I would
have thought, in the United States that anyone who wants
to display a message in granite in a public park can put
it there. No one assumes that. Everyone assumes that,
if the granite monument is there, the city or whatever
has said, yes, we approve it, put it there.
MS. HARRIS: The city in this case --
everybody may assume that, and they would be right. The
city in this case did say, yes, we approve that monument
and not that one. So you can put yours up, and you
can't. That doesn't solve the First Amendment problem.
That is the First Amendment problem that the Government
JUSTICE SOUTER: It may create the First
Amendment problem, but it seems to me, going back to
Justice Alito's question, that the City's decision is a
clear adoption of the monument.
MS. HARRIS: If all we have, I think,
Justice Souter, is that the city has permitted one
private speaker to erect a monument, there is no
constitutional or judicially manageable line between
that and just the ordinary thing the Government always
does when it grants preferred access to a public forum,
which is to say you're in, you're out. If that's enough
for adoption, then there are no more First Amendment
violations through lack of equal access.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but even on your own
criterion, if the city passes a resolution saying we
adopt this, you're still -- you're going to be faced
with precisely the content discrimination problem that
you're arguing about here.
MS. HARRIS: But because it's adopted it as
its own message, then we think the Government is
speaking. And when the Government is speaking, as the
United States, said it is entitled to make content and
viewpoint distinctions, but in order to do that, it has
to step up and speak itself. That's the justification
for the Government speech doctrine.
JUSTICE SOUTER: You're basically just
arguing for a clear statement rule. I mean, Justice
Alito's question, my analogies are suggestive of the
fact that there is an affirmative Government act of some
indication of approval when it says, yes, you can put
the monument here. And what you're arguing for is,
well, we want a clearer statement, we want it to say,
yes, we really adopt it, it's ours from the heart. And
that seems to be the difference between your position
and the -- and the position that acceptance of the
monument is enough.
MS. HARRIS: I would formulate it only
slightly differently, which is not so much a clear
statement but that those are really two different
things, approving it for access and adopting the message
as the Government's own. And that the differences --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you can --
MS. HARRIS: -- that would --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You can make that
distinction. There's no -- I understand the distinction
you're making, but because I don't see that that's a
distinction that a reasonable member of the public would
understand to be implied by the -- or at least to be --
to be raised by the placement of the monument, I don't
know why it's a distinction that should be significant
for First Amendment purposes.
MS. HARRIS: If what matters is the public
perception, then, yes, we do think that to clarify an
unclear situation like this, where have you a monument
that says it's presented by the Eagles, it has the
Eagles emblem, the Eagles are continuing to maintain it
in the park, and that's a fact we should assume a
reasonable observer would know, then, yes, be clear.
The Government -- there's one way to clarify that, and
that's for the Government to adopt it.
JUSTICE ALITO: And when Government adopts
it, can it at that time specify what it understands the
statement to be?
MS. HARRIS: I think it can, Justice Alito.
It can adopt -- now the Government is speaking, now this
is the Government's own message, and it can tailor its
adoption to make clear what message it's adopting.
And in answer to some of Justice Scalia's
questions, I think the Government here could put up a
plaque in front of the Eagles' monument that says
"Monument of the City of Pleasant Grove and dedicated to
the role that the Ten Commandments play in secular law."
It can do that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose the resolution of
adoption by the City Council just says, "The City
Council agrees that this monument of the Eagle
Association expresses an idea worthy of the public's
attention."
MS. HARRIS: I think the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that enough?
MS. HARRIS: No. I think that the ordinance
-- or the ordinance has to do one more thing, which is
to -- which is to say, "This is a monument of the City
of Pleasant Grove, we adopt the content of the
monument," not just "we approve it." "We are giving it
preferential access, and here is why."
JUSTICE SOUTER: You want a signing
statement as well as a signature?
(Laughter.)
MS. HARRIS: Like that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it depend on --
given the focus on public perception, does it depend on
the content of the speech? In other words, if you came
across a monument and it said, "The Eagles are a lot
better than every other organization, you should give
money to the Eagles," someone is going to walk by that
and say, "Well, that's probably not the City, that's
probably the Eagles." But the Eagles, you know, for all
the good they do, did not come up with the Ten
Commandments, and somebody is going to look at that and
say, "That's probably the City." They are not going to
look at that and immediately say, "That's what the
Eagles believe."
MS. HARRIS: Well, I think it's actually
trickier than that, more complicated than that, Your
Honor. Again, given this monument, I think there will
be questions about whether this is the speech of the
Eagles. And I actually think that, given all the legal
sensitivities around a Ten Commandments monument, your
average citizen, when they see a religious monument in a
park, may well think that may be private speech because
the Government usually can't endorse or at least
sometimes can't endorse religious speech. So I actually
think these questions are very complicated.
And, again, if you want to be clear about
who's speaking, there's an easy way to do that, which is
for the Government straightforwardly and clearly to
adopt this speech as its own.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What if it's just a statue
of George Washington? What kind of a resolution does
the city council adopt? "We endorse everything George
Washington ever said"?
MS. HARRIS: No. No. Again, and in my
answer to Justice Alito, they can adopt any resolution
they want so long as they adopt that statue as a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if --
MS. HARRIS: -- city memorial.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right, and I think
they would adopt a resolution that says, "We think
George Washington is worthy of respect and emulation on
the part of our citizens."
MS. HARRIS: And so long as that is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If it could say that, why
couldn't it say the same thing about the Ten
Commandments? "We think the Ten Commandments are worthy
of respect and" -- and I wouldn't say "emulation"; I
would say "respect and reverence by our citizens."
MS. HARRIS: So long as --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that be enough?
MS. HARRIS: So long as it is preceded by a
statement that the city actually adopts the memorial as
its own, that this is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what that
means.
MS. HARRIS: -- a Pleasant Grove memorial or
a Pleasant Grove monument.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It has acquired the
memorial. The City has acquired property in this
memorial and has agreed for this memorial to be placed
in the city park. Period. "We believe that the Ten
Commandments which are embodied in this memorial are
worthy of respect by the citizens of Pleasant Grove" --
is that enough?
MS. HARRIS: It may be that if the
Government goes on long enough, it will have connoted
what is very important here, which is that it is
prepared to adopt the content of that monument as its
own.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what that
means. You keep saying it, and I don't know what it
means.
MS. HARRIS: It means --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought
adopting what I said shows that it is adopting the
content of the monument insofar as the monument says the
Ten Commandments should be respected by the citizens of
Pleasant Grove. Is that enough?
MS. HARRIS: If the City says --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Or it has to say, "We
believe in the Ten Commandments"?
MS. HARRIS: No. No. I understand your
question, Justice Scalia. If the City says what you
just said, "We are adopting this monument insofar" and
however it wants to finish that sentence, that is fine.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think that's
fairly implied by the mere fact that it is there in
Pleasant Grove's park and that Pleasant Grove City
Council has allowed it to be constructed there? Don't
you think that's implicit?
MS. HARRIS: No, I don't, Your Honor. I
think that all that implies is that Pleasant Grove has
decided this speech is worthy of display in this public
park based on its content. And that is the decision the
City can't make. If it were just a formality, if it
were simple, and it's all the same, who cares?, then I
think that Pleasant Grove would be here saying something
--
different, which is, "We adopt. We adopt. We'll check
that box." There are substantive reasons why it doesn't
-- it may be a fine line --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the City doesn't know
MS. HARRIS: -- but the City doesn't want to
cross it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- know what you mean by
"We adopt," just as I don't know what you mean by "We
adopt."
MS. HARRIS: Well, whether or not the City
knows what we mean, what we know from the City's brief
is that what it's saying is -- and this is on page 33 of
its brief -- the Government speech here is only in the
act of selection. Selection. It's not about the
content of that monument. That's not enough to make a
Government speech, and the City is not permitted to
speak through selection, and --
JUSTICE BREYER: What do we do -- is this
monument suspiciously similar to the one in Texas? And
so if the history is the same, you would know that there
was -- a big element of this was Cecile B. DeMille
trying to promote his movie, The Ten Commandments. So
he gave money to the Eagles, and the Eagles put Ten
Commandments all over because it would be good for the
morality of people, and also it would help promote the
movie. All right? Is that true -- is that the actual
description here?
MS. HARRIS: This is part of the same Eagles
project --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MS. HARRIS: -- that was --
JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so if that's the
history of it, what does that mean? I mean, where do we
go with that? Then this is in fact partly an attempt to
promote morality, partly an attempt to be civic, partly
an attempt to promote a movie. So, what do we do with
that?
MS. HARRIS: It's all a private message, and
it may be a private message that has many different
elements, but nothing about that suggests Government
speech. And even if all the Government is doing in its
public part is promoting one version of the Cecile
DeMille movie, it can't do that on a content basis.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Why not? Why --
suppose that there -- there are certain messages that
private people had like "eat vitamins" --
MS. HARRIS: Uh-huh.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and so they say -- you
know, whatever those are; and then somebody comes along
with a totally different content, "ride the roller
coaster," and they say this part of the park is designed
to get healthy children, not put children at risk. So
therefore we like messages to eat vitamins, and we don't
want messages, "ride the roller coaster." This is all
private. It's the -- you know -- now what?
MS. HARRIS: The problem is that it's a
public park, and content --
JUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, they --
the --
MS. HARRIS: Eating vitamins and roller
coasters are not --
JUSTICE BREYER: They can't do either.
MS. HARRIS: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any case that says
-- can they have playgrounds in the park?
MS. HARRIS: They can have playgrounds, yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so we have right in
the playground, we have "eat vitamins," "eat your --
clean up all your -- all the food in your plate," "don't
throw food at your brother," okay?
So -- I mean --
MS. HARRIS: Those are private messages.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all private.
MS. HARRIS: Uh-huh. Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER: Because there are various
groups that feel that's important; the city says yes, it
is; and we don't want things like pull the dog's tail,
or --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: -- whatever. So -- so
what's wrong with that? Where does the First Amendment
forbid that? You promote -- they want in this corner,
promoting in the playground good things that they like
and not bad ones. Where does it permit it? What's the
case that says that the Government couldn't do that?
MS. HARRIS: It's all the cases that say the
Government can't do it.
JUSTICE BREYER: Give one and I'll read it.
Give me three; I'll read them.
MS. HARRIS: I'll give you Pinette. The
Government can't make content based decisions in a
public forum. And there is not a limit --
JUSTICE BREYER: But the children's
playground isn't the public forum.
MS. HARRIS: Oh, but the Government -- a
public park is a public forum. If the Government wants
to set aside part of that park -- change the physical
characteristics, change the principal use and bear the
attendant cost, it can definitely do that. That is in
fact the answer to the sculpture garden; that's what
happened there. The Government waived part of what it
been a public forum; it put up fences; it changed the
principal use; it limited the public access. It is no
longer a park. It is now a museum.
I'm sorry. I misunderstood. The Government
can --
JUSTICE BREYER: I see where you're going.
Thank you.
MS. HARRIS: Okay.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you taking this line
because you say if the city council votes for it, then
the voters can know those people voted to put up the Ten
Commandments; we don't like that; so we are going to
vote them out? Is that -- what underlies this notion
that it isn't good enough for them to approve the
placement of the monument, but it has to be some kind of
formal declaration?
MS. HARRIS: What underlies it is that the
Government speech -- the Government speech doctrine is
an exception to normal First Amendment, and very
important First Amendment constraints. And what
underlies the distinction is that that exception is
justified only when the Government is speaking for
itself. The Government needs to be able to promote its
own messages, its own ideas. But if it's not doing
that, if it's disclaiming the content of the monument,
saying those are not our own ideas, those are not our
own messages, then there is just no justification for
allowing it to prefer one form of private speech over
another. The justification for allowing that exception
is missing.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's not disclaiming it
here. The Government isn't disclaiming it. And the
difference it seems to me between you and your friends
on the other side is you want this clear statement. You
want a statement -- for example if you took Justice
Scalia's statement, that would satisfy you, and it would
also be the poison pill in the Establishment Clause.
Isn't that what's -- I mean, that's okay with me. I
don't see that as an illegitimate object. I was a Van
Orden dissenter -- I mean, but isn't that what is
driving this?
MS. HARRIS: Well, I do think that the --
the city is a bit on the horns of a dilemma because it
wants to have it both ways. It wants to be able to say
this speech is governmental for purposes of blocking
equal access rights; but not so governmental at that
it's a big Establishment Clause problem. So yes, I
think there is a dilemma here for the city.
Thank you, Your Honors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Sekulow, you have two minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SEKULOW: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
With regard to the hypothetical about the
Senator McCain or President-elect Obama signs, there is
another factor that's important here; and that is those
signs are created by those -- usually by the campaigns.
So the fact that it's created by a third party doesn't
in any way diminish the speech aspect of an individual
who has put that sign in their home. Also with regard
to the adopt the monument, governments don't adopt
monuments; they adopt resolutions that accept monuments.
That's the way it worked here; that's the way it works
in most municipalities. That's this -- the trigger of
allowing the monument to be displayed. Here there are
two. The city -- it was approached and made a formal
acceptance, and it was noted later in their minutes as
well, so in two different places.
With regard to the adoption of the speech
problem, Justice Alito, under the hypothetical or -- not
hypothetical, the factual situation that you talk about,
under the Tenth Circuit's theory, the case, in
Respondent's theory of the case, al-Qaeda sympathizers
could come in and say we want to erect a monument
praising the value of the terrorists, and unless there's
a compelling governmental interest, there would be no
basis on which to deny it. That's why the whole public
forum analysis on this, in our view is absolutely
incorrect.
And finally on the adopt a speech, there are
monuments and memorials that incorporate a variety of
message, including Holocaust memorials, and they will
often have in place Nazi-era propaganda, the signs from
the Nazis that were designed to draw hatred towards
Jews; and they will incorporate those into the monuments
and the displays. They are not adopting the message of
the Nazis; they are showing the history of what took
place during an era. That's very, very different.
The Statute of Liberty, which was donated to
the United States, was from the Franco-American Union, a
private organization. The United States -- and it's
found in the appendix to our reply brief -- specifically
accepted the monument, authorized the president to
accept and they erected the pedestal. All privately
funded in that regard, and it was originated by a third
party. The Government was speaking when they erected
that monument; the fact that the Antiquities Act came
into play, which just means you cannot harm those
monuments, it's no different than Pioneer Park, which is
a national historic treasure.
And last point, Mr. Chief Justice, if I man,
is the reliance on Pinette is misplaced because as this
Court said, Pinette is an Establishment Clause case, and
the reliance here by the Respondent has been on the Free
Speech Clause. We think the Tenth Circuit is wrong,
both under the Government speech analysis and under the
forum approach, and for that reason should be vacated.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case in the
