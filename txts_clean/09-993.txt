CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 09-993, Pliva,
Incorporated v. Mensing, and the consolidated cases.
Mr. Lefkowitz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
This case involves the ordinary operation of
the Supremacy Clause. As the government agrees,
Hatch-Waxman's plain text requires generic drugs to have
the same warnings as their brand-name equivalents, so
State law can't require generic drugs to use different
warnings. After all, generics can't simultaneously
comply with a Federal duty to be the same and a State
duty to be different.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that makes a
lot of sense, but we do have our Wyeth decision that
seems to cut the other way.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, the Wyeth
decision is premised on the fundamental conclusion that
Federal law obligates and accommodates the brand
manufacturer to utilize a specific regulation, the CBE
regulation, in order to make a warning change, in order
to comply with its obligations under 201.57. And, as
the government agrees, we don't have the opportunity or
the authority to use a CBE regulation change.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have another --
you have another route, and that's what the government
is telling us: That you could propose a revision of the
label, and if you did that, then you would be home free.
You would not be subject to the State suit.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Ginsburg, the
government agrees with us that we can't actually change
the label. What they say is, we could have an
obligation, or they actually, in -- for the very first
time ever in their brief in this Court at the merit
stage, said that there is a --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, it was in the -- at
the cert stage as well.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, I didn't
read the cert stage as saying we had quite the same duty
to ask the FDA, although clearly they now believe that
we have a duty to ask the FDA. And of course that's not
a duty that appears in any of their notice and comment
rulemaking.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can we call this the take
steps -- is this the take-steps doctrine, for purposes
of discussion here?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Yes, Justice Kennedy, this
is the take-steps.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear to me
whether you say that that is preempted or just that it
was not well-pled. I'm not -- I'm not sure of your
position on that point.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Thank you, Justice Kennedy.
We maintain that a claim that under State law a generic
company can be liable for not asking the FDA to make a
labeling change is preempted under this Court's
decisions both in Buckman and in ArkLa, because what
the -- what the Court has said is that the disclosure
obligations between a Federal agency and a Federally
regulated party are inherently Federal in character, and
this is not a subject of traditional State tort law.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, why
should --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Would the -- excuse me,
Justice.
Would the Federally licensed drug
manufacturer have a similar obligation to lobby the FDA
for a change?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: No, Your Honor, and in fact
that was in part what was -- what came up in the
briefing in the Wyeth case. Wyeth initially said it
didn't have the obligation and couldn't use the CBE, and
then Ms. Levine said: Well, in that case you could have
asked the FDA to make a change, and the Court didn't
need to even address that issue, because the Court found
that there actually was a regulation on point that gave
the brand manufacturer the ability to change.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But assume there hadn't
been. Assume there hadn't been such a regulation. Do
you understand it to be the government's position that
the licensed drug manufacturer is not protected from
State suits, even though it has a Federal permission to
give certain warnings, unless it has lobbied the FDA to
change those warnings?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I -- I don't see
anything in the history, the 27-year history of
Hatch-Waxman, where the Federal government has ever said
that there is a legal obligation to lobby the FDA for a
labeling change.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. There is a
legal obligation to advise the FDA when you have reports
of adverse results that suggest the label may be wrong.
Are you disavowing your -- your obligation to tell the
FDA when something's wrong?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely not, Justice
Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So please describe
what the difference between that obligation and the
obligation to suggest a label change when you know it's
been misbranded.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Under the FDA Regulation
4.80 and 314.98, we have a myriad of disclosure
obligations. Any time a generic learns about an adverse
report, it has to report it to the FDA, it has to
investigate it, and if it doesn't do that then it's not
in compliance with its Federal obligations and the FDA
has plenary authority to take all sorts of action.
But just as the Court said in the Buckman
decision, without dissent, when a company doesn't make
appropriate disclosures to the FDA, even if people are
hurt by that, even if it's -- if it causes people to be
injured and States might otherwise want to compensate
them for them, those disclosure obligations are up to
the FDA with its discretion to enforce. And the Court
looked directly to Congress in section 337.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's -- so what's
the conflict with State law, meaning you have an
obligation to keep your label as it is, but if you also
have a Federal obligation to advise the FDA of
adverse -- of adverse results and of needs for change,
why can't you then comply with a duty to warn obligation
because you can go to the -- to the FDA?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, first of all, there's
a little bit of a difference between reporting all of
the adverse events, which we clearly do, and asking the
FDA to make a determination that the FDA has said is
only for the FDA to make with respect to generic
companies.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you contest,
Mr. Lefkowitz, your ability to make that request? I
know that you contest your obligation to make that
request, but do you think you could go to the FDA and
make that request and set a process in motion?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, there's no
question that we could certainly ask the FDA, and in
fact if we had reason to believe that a label was not
accurate, not strong enough, we would certainly do that.
The question is whether or not there's either a Federal
obligation or a State duty to do this, and --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if you could go to the
FDA, why shouldn't we look at this suit in this way:
That the plaintiffs are bringing a standard failure to
warn claim; that you then have a preemption defense,
that you'll say it's impossible; and then in order to
litigate that preemption defense, the question will be,
well, if you had gone to the FDA, what would the FDA
have done? Would it in fact have required both brand
names and generics to change the label? And if it would
have, you would not have had -- been put in an
impossible position.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, that is the
precise set of issues that this Court addressed both in
Buckman and in ArkLa, in a situation where all we could
have done, and we weren't obligated to do, was ask the
FDA. For a State to hold us liable for not asking the
FDA is asking a State jury to put itself into the shoes
of the FDA, to speculate how the FDA would have decided
hypothetical issues, which ArkLa says is foreclosed in
an area where the Federal Government, the Federal
agency, has exclusive authority. And in Buckman, the
Court said that would disrupt and usurp the discretion
of the agency to decide whether to punish and how to
punish disclosure.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Buckman --
Buckman was arguably a little bit different, in that
there's a concern expressed in that case that
requiring allowing the State suit to go forward would
cause manufacturers to basically inundate the agency
with proposals and warning revisions, so that there
would be so many things that the agency wouldn't even be
able to process them, and they would become meaningless
to the consumers. That doesn't seem to me to be a
concern in this case.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, the
government had articulated that proposition in the
Buckman case and again several years later in the
Warner-Lambert case. Obviously, they're taking a
different position here.
But I would submit, Your Honor, that what
lay at the core of the Buckman decision was that the
relationship, the disclosures, between the Federal
agency and its regulated party, are inherently Federal
and States simply don't have a business trying to
enforce those obligations, because that does take away
from the authority and the discretion. And the Court
looked to section 337 as evidence that Congress intended
that violations of the FDCA be enforced by the Federal
Government.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Federal agency says
that these suits complement, they're not at odds with,
the Federal regime, because they give the manufacturers
an incentive to come forward. Everyone is interested in
making sure that only safe drugs are marketed. So, far
from detracting from the Federal regime, the agency
responsible says, this helps us; it encourages
manufacturers to report.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, we know from the
current FDA database that there were over 1600 requests
for labeling revisions that the FDA has not acted on,
and that's just in the aftermath of Wyeth. And there
are far more generic manufacturers who would be burdened
by this new obligation. But, Your Honor, I would --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is there any
breakdown as to how many of those requests are generic
and how many from branded?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, almost all of
them I would believe are from branded manufacturers,
because generic manufacturers until the briefing in this
Court have never believed that they have any obligation
to ask the FDA.
In fact, interestingly, the FDA has
addressed what happens in the marketplace when a brand
exits the market and the only drugs left are the 10 or
generics. And what the FDA has said, and they have
published 52 Federal Register notices -- we cite one of
them in our reply brief -- they have said: In such a
situation, we will designate one of the generics to be
the leader for purposes of establishing the label, and
everyone else has to follow.
But critically, what the FDA has said is:
In those situations, we, the FDA, will tell you when the
label needs to change.
JUSTICE BREYER: So what are you supposed to
do if your company happens by chance to come across a
very, very high correlation between people who take your
generic drug and who get seriously ill?
And now what you know is that nobody else
has really found that, but, my goodness, there you are;
it happened that it was associated, a special group or
something. What are you supposed to do?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, we have an
obligation, actually, to provide all of that information
to the FDA. Generics, unlike brand companies, aren't
equipped in the same way, necessarily, to evaluate
the --
JUSTICE BREYER: And so are they saying that
you -- is it conceded in this case that you did tell the
FDA everything you knew about that?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, no. We --
JUSTICE BREYER: Or is that a point in
dispute?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: The plaintiffs allege that
we violated Federal disclosure obligations. Of course,
there's no basis for a State claim for that.
In fact, to -- to address Justice Ginsburg's
question --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how would it
conflict? Suppose the State said: Here is what we
want; we notice that it says in the Federal law that you
must keep your warnings up to date, and if you find an
association, you must revise your warning. Now, we
understand you can't do that without FDA approval. But
as far as our State is concerned, we think that when you
come across this serious problem you have to tell the
FDA in some form or other, a reasonable form, about it.
Would that law -- is there anything Federal that that
law would conflict with?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: I think that law, Your
Honor, would conflict with the Buckman principles and
the ArkLa principles.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said you had
to tell the FDA about it.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: If the -- I understood
Justice Breyer's question to be asking whether -- not
only did we have to tell the FDA, which we clearly do,
but whether we then had some additional duty to ask the
FDA to change the warning.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I didn't understand
that.
JUSTICE BREYER: What I wonder -- see, I
wonder if that's this case. I wonder if this case is
what they're saying is: Oh, we concede you told the FDA
every single thing, so they were just as informed as you
are about the risks here, but you did not add the words:
And please change our -- your permission, so that we can
change the warning. Is that what this case is about?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, I think that's what
they're suggesting. But even if it were just the
former --
JUSTICE BREYER: When they come up here they
might say this isn't just what this case is about.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Even if it's just the
former, Your Honor, even if it's just the failure to
disclose adverse reports --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: -- which we know we have an
obligation to do, there is no history of State
regulation of communications between Federal -- Federal
agencies and the regulated parties. Those are not the
kinds of parallel claims cases, like in Lohr v.
Medtronic --
JUSTICE BREYER: So your argument is that if
we run across this tremendous, really serious -- I can
make an imaginary as serious as you want -- really a
serious problem, and you're saying the State has no
right to say -- even if we purposely didn't tell
anybody, they can't get involved because they can't get
involved with our failure to tell the FDA anything
because that's Federal, and we can't -- they can't get
involved with our failure to try to change the warning
because that's taken care of by our obligation to tell
them, which we didn't fulfill?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Breyer, correct,
because that's exactly -- remember, in Buckman what
happened was an individual was injured because the
company had not accurately disclosed, in fact had misled
the agency about the purpose of marketing these bone
screws. Clearly there was a State interest in
protecting and providing a remedy to that consumer, a
State interest in ensuring accurate disclosures to the
government, and in fact an allegation that had there
been accurate disclosures to the government, the FDA
would have made a different safety and labeling
determination.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that if the
claim here is simply that you did not disclose properly,
that claim could be brought?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Not in a State court, Your
Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To disclose -- I'm
sorry. To disclose to the FDA?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: To disclose to the FDA.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: A claim, Your Honor, of
disclosure to the FDA relates to the inherently Federal
relationship.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you just described
Buckman as -- as involving precisely that, failure to
tell the FDA the purpose of the screws. You said that
the State -- the State suit would lie because of that
failure.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: No, I said the State suit --
I apologize. I meant to say and I thought I said the
State suit would not lie because Buckman preempts that
type of lawsuit. Buckman says even in that terrible
situation, misleading to the FDA, failure to disclose
what the FDA requires you to disclose, there is no State
cause of action because this is a uniquely Federal area
and States can't supplant the FDA in its enforcement
discretion.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Lefkowitz, I think
what the Respondents would say is that you are
mischaracterizing their complaint and making it into
something that it's not. Their complaint is a standard
state failure to warn claim. Now, you have a preemption
defense to that claim, and in that preemption defense
there's going to be questions about your disclosure
obligations and whether the FDA would have responded in
a certain way to your disclosure obligations, but it's
in a fundamentally different posture than the one that
you're suggesting.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Kagan, I would agree
with you that what they pled below was a traditional
failure to warn. A failure to warn claim means you did
not warn the public in the way that we think under State
law you should have. And whereas in Wyeth the Congress
through the FDA has said a brand manufacturer ultimately
is responsible for the warnings it issues and therefore
can change the warning and therefore can be held liable,
we don't have -- and the government agrees with us -- we
don't have any mechanism under law to change the
warnings. So to the extent this is a traditional
failure to warn claim, it has to be preempted under
simple Supremacy Clause principles.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I agree that you don't
have any ability yourself to change the warning, but
here's what the FDA has said. The FDA has said if an
ANDA applicant -- and that's you; you're an ANDA
applicant -- believes new safety information should be
added to a product's labeling, presumably because
they've gotten information that suggests that the
product's labeling is wrong, then it should contact the
FDA, and the FDA will determine whether the labeling for
the generic and listed drugs should be revised.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, that is exactly
what the FDA says. They point for that to a preamble in
92 to a rulemaking that didn't address the relevant
1.57 regulation, a preamble that was issued without
notice and comment rulemaking, and a preamble that
doesn't actually impose a duty. It says if,
subjunctively, we believe that there should be a label
change, we should do something, we should ask the FDA.
Not we must, not we shall.
And even then it said: And the FDA will
then make a decision, which makes clear that this is not
a decision for State juries to make. Your Honor, the
FDA has articulated a Federal duty today in its briefing
in this case that is very much at odds with what it has
specifically said about what a generic's obligation is
under 201.57. In the two notice and comment rulemakings
at issue during the relevant time period here, in 2000
and 2006, what the FDA said very specifically was a
generic's obligation under 201.57 is to use the brand
label, even if the brand label isn't the most
up-to-date.
And the reason is the policy underlying
Hatch-Waxman is that brand companies do safety and
efficacy testing; generics do sameness testing.
Generics are required to make copies of the drugs and by
definition make copies of the labels, because it
wouldn't make any sense to go into a drugstore to buy
Advil and to see 15 different generic ibuprofen and to
have 15 different sets of warnings.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Buckman was a case -- I'm
pronouncing it right, I think, Buckman -- where it was a
branded manufacturer, was it not?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: It was a medical device
manufacturer.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: A medical device
manufacturer. So there it was -- it was an FDA process,
and we said there's no State cause of action for saying
that the FDA process -- that's slightly different from
saying that you have a duty to warn the FDA. You might
say it's a fortiori.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I do think it's
a fortiori. Buckman involves the branded process of
coming on with an equivalent medical device under the
0K process. This is actually a situation where, after
intensive back and forth with the FDA, the brand company
crafts the label that the FDA approves and the generic
is given one responsibility by Congress. The
responsibility is to maintain the same label as the
brand. That's the critical difference.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you think
Congress really intended to create a market in which
consumers can only sue brand-named products? Because if
that's the case, why would anybody ever take a genetic?
And why in the world would Congress create a different,
or even the FDA, a different obligation on brand-named
products or generic products to give them information
about labels when they know there's been a misbranding?
What the government says is you start by
instructing a jury that there had to actually have been
information that proved a misbranding. That's the first
step of the tort suit according to the government. So
why should you or why would Congress or the FDA have
intended to treat the two differently?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Sotomayor, I want to
take both halves of your question. In 27 years of
enforcement under Hatch-Waxman, the FDA has never once
said that a generic drug that uses the brand label, as
required under 505(j) of the statute is misbranded. And
the -- look, I understand that from the consumer's
perspective it may not make a lot of sense. But what
Congress specifically said is that a generic has to bear
the same label, and it's because they do have different
purposes, different functions. Congress said that
whenever there is a brand drug on the market that no
longer is protected by its patent monopoly but has been
selling for $10 or $20 a pill, we want to have generics
selling for pennies for the pill, and they've given
branded and generics different obligations.
And the different obligations are seen most
clearly through the prism of the Wyeth case. The Wyeth
case was -- it was critical in the Wyeth case that this
Court found that the brand company had the ability, had
the obligation, to use the CBE regulations to actually
change the label, whereas here what the FDA has said
time and time again is: We'll tell a generic when the
generic has to change the label, because we don't assume
that the generics are going to know when the label
should change because they don't have the same basis of
clinical testing and results.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lefkowitz, there's a
certain overlap, is there not? Some of the generics are
made by the same people that make the brand-name drugs,
isn't that so?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And at least for those
people, they have the means.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I don't know
whether or not the -- the FDA or this Court would hold
differently in a case where the generic at issue was an
authorized generic, a generic manufactured by a brand
company that had, in fact, done all the clinical safety
testing and might have a different basis for assessing
the occasional adverse reports that they get.
But, again, the keys to understanding the --
the generic industry -- generics rarely even get adverse
reports because if a doctor prescribes a drug, the
doctor prescribes it as the brand, and then checks off
the box that says a generic can be issued. If a patient
comes and tells him about an adverse report, the doctor
has no idea which generic of the 15 that might be in the
market actually was dispensed, so he'll actually tell
the brand company. He'll report the adverse event to
the brand company.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all you're
arguing is that this rule will have little practical
effect, that there is going to be very few lawsuits that
could be brought against your companies because you're
just not going to have enough information to suggest a
label change.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, what I'm arguing
is that for the FDA to impose a new Federal obligation
that will significantly change the way generic companies
conduct their business should go through notice and
comment rulemaking. It should not rely on a preamble to
a different rulemaking that didn't go through notice and
comment. It should not rely on briefs that are filed at
the merits stage, because this would totally change the
way generics do business.
Generics don't have a practice -- they're
not even set up -- to go and figure out what label
changes would be appropriate. They are set up to report
adverse events to the FDA, and what Congress has said
and what the FDA has said is violations of those
statutes, violations of those regulations, are
exclusively within the province of the Federal
government. That's what Buckman says very clearly when
it looks at Section 337.
If I may, I would like to reserve my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Lefkowitz.
Mr. Bograd.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS M. BOGRAD
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BOGRAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The central issue in this case is that
Petitioners, in the face of considerable information
that the warnings on their products were inadequate, did
nothing. The generic drug companies' position is that
they -- no matter how much they know, no matter how
grave the risk, they are under no obligation to do
anything to warn of the dangers of the products they
sell.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're -- they're --
they're under the obligation to report to the FDA the
facts which establish the grave risk, right?
MR. BOGRAD: Yes, they are, Your Honor.
They're obliged under --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So the argument here is
whether it -- it will be the FDA ultimately that
determines whether there was a grave enough risk to
modify the -- the label or whether that call will be
made by -- by a State court guessing what the FDA would
have done, right?
MR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor, that's not
correct. What this Court said in Wyeth v. Levine is
that State juries are a perfectly appropriate vehicle
for assessing whether warnings in the past were
adequately given. We do -- we do not dispute that the
issue about what language will be on a label going
forward rests with the agency.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but -- but -- no,
but -- but surely you have to establish not only that
the generic manufacturer requested a label change, but
that a label change would have been approved. Otherwise
there's no causation. Surely --
MR. BOGRAD: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's part of your
case, isn't it?
MR. BOGRAD: No, it's not, Justice Scalia.
The -- as Petitioners concede in the brief, under
traditional State law failure to warn claim, our
affirmative case is that the warnings that were given to
the doctor and to the patient were inadequate, and that
because adequate warnings weren't given, the patient was
injured.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but their --
their preemption claim is we had to give these warnings,
and you don't contest that. They had to give the
warnings that they gave, unless the FDA said that the
warnings must be changed, so --
MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I mean, I don't see how
you can hold them liable, so long as they continued to
give the warnings that they had to give.
MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And they could have lobbied
the FDA to say, you know, change the warning, but if the
FDA said -- suppose the -- suppose they did tell the
FDA, please modify the label, and the FDA said no.
Would your lawsuit still proceed?
MR. BOGRAD: No, it would not, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No.
MR. BOGRAD: Once the FDA said no, we would
have clear evidence that the FDA would have rejected the
warning --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I would say --
MR. BOGRAD: -- which is what this Court
said in Levine is the touchstone.
JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. You're drawing
a line between the FDA rejecting a warning and the FDA
not accepting the warning; is that the line you're
drawing?
MR. BOGRAD: Yes, Your Honor, for purposes
of impossibility. In order for the -- preemption is an
affirmative defense, and for the defendants to establish
that it was impossible, i.e., that the duties under
State and Federal law were in direct conflict, they have
to show that the FDA would have rejected --
JUSTICE BREYER: It appears also that the --
it's Buckman, it seems to me, the relevant case, not
Wyeth, because what -- if -- you're now saying, I've
learned, that -- that they have a set of FDA duties;
they must tell the FDA every detail.
MR. BOGRAD: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: That sounds awfully
familiar to Buckman, where the State claim was basically
a claim of fraud on the FDA. And we said it's not up to
the State to -- to -- they can't bring -- have a claim
for fraud on the FDA. The FDA has to enforce their own
stuff. And why isn't the same true here, that the FDA
has to enforce their own legal requirement to tell us
everything you know? What's the answer to that?
MR. BOGRAD: Well, there are two answers,
Your Honor. First -- first, this Court's decision in
Levine is inconsistent with that sweeping reading --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, because Levine involves
the Wyeth case, right?
MR. BOGRAD: Yes. I'm sorry, I --
JUSTICE BREYER: No. The -- the difference
there is the difference that the SG points out: There
is a broad-ranging obligation for the initial drugmaker
to tell the FDA all kinds of things and change the
warnings. But here the FDA tells us they have no power
to change their warnings. They can't, unlike Levine.
They have to copy the original maker. So -- I'm -- I'm
just referring there to the whole SG brief.
MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, let me respond to
that in -- in two ways. First --
JUSTICE BREYER: Be sure you answer, please,
my original question.
MR. BOGRAD: I -- I will, Your Honor.
The -- to focus first on the CBE issue, one
of the things this Court noted in Levine is that even
under the CBE process, the ultimate decision about
whether the labeling is changed rests with the FDA, not
with the manufacturer. The -- the fundamental issue in
Levine was that the primary responsibility for labeling
rested with the manufacturer, not with the agency,
subject to the agency's review. And we don't dispute
that the agency has the right to review and can reject a
label.
The -- what was at the core and what this
Court cited, although the -- the number has changed in
Wyeth v. Levine, is the obligation under 21 CFR
1.57(e), which you call 201.80(e) because they -- they
renumbered it -- that the label warnings shall be
revised as soon as there's reasonable evidence of an
association of a serious hazard with the drug.
The government says, and the regulatory
structure makes clear, that that provision applies with
full force to generic drug manufacturers, not just to
name-brand drug manufacturers. It is the regulatory
implementation of the obligation under the Federal
misbranding statute, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2) that says you
can't sell a drug that doesn't have adequate warnings
about its risks.
So, when you're -- when the manufacturer is
confronted with information that the warnings on its
drug are not adequate, it -- the way it -- the way it
should respond is by immediately going to the FDA and
saying to the agency: We have this new information; we
ask you, not that we want a different warning from the
name brand, but we ask you to approve a stronger warning
on both the name-brand product and its generic
equivalents.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what happens --
MR. BOGRAD: And had they done so, we would
know -- one of two things would have happened. Either
the agency would have approved the warning, stronger
warnings would have been given and our clients -- my
clients likely would not have been injured; or they
would have said, no, we don't think there's sufficient
information to justify this warning.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How long does it
take -- how long typically does it take the FDA to
respond to a request from a generic manufacturer that
it -- it ask the branded manufacturer to change the
label?
MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, as you just heard
from Mr. Lefkowitz, generic manufacturers typically
haven't been fulfilling this obligation and have not
been asking the agency. But the latest data from the
agency, and this is from its -- its web site, is that
under -- they've been publishing performance data since
07, and they now say that safety labeling changes,
which are the labeling changes required under FD --
under FDA, are processed typically in a matter of
months, 94 percent within 3 months.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those the ones
that are submitted by generic manufacturers?
MR. BOGRAD: They're -- they are -- they
could be ones submitted by generic manufacturers. Those
are ones where the information that comes to the agency
triggers a -- a labeling revision process.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the -- does the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether about --
MR. BOGRAD: I'm sorry, what was that?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to
ask, does the FDA give you an up or a down, or does it
just not take action sometimes if you submit one of
these requests?
MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, my understanding --
there were certainly procedures available that would
have required an up-or-down: The citizens petition
process, for example, the supplement process, for
example. The -- what -- the government has represented
that even if the request came in a more informal form,
the government would nevertheless take a request for a
-- a labeling change to reflect a serious inadequacy in
label warning seriously and act on it promptly.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Just so I understand what
you've said, this 3-month turnaround that you mentioned,
they are all requests from labeled manufacturers, right?
MR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor, these are --
these are actually --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said that
generic manufacturers don't make any requests.
MR. BOGRAD: I -- they could be -- they
could be from name-brand companies; they could be from
private citizens.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.
MR. BOGRAD: It's whenever the agency
becomes aware of information.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see.
MR. BOGRAD: But the agency also processes
supplement requests, according to its web site, in 97
percent of the cases or something, within 4 months.
It's not -- it's -- it is a matter of months, not -- not
years.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you, and I think
that this is part of what your adversary has been
talking about when he says we don't usually receive
adverse incident reports; they go to the brand
manufacturer. So tell me what you view as your main
obligation. This is a little bit like what Justice
Scalia was asking.
You come in and you say there's a drug, it
has an adverse effect, there should have been a warning
about it because look at all of this literature, look at
all of this proof --
MR. BOGRAD: Uh-huh.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that this drug is, in
fact, in some way plausibly or otherwise causing this
incident, and the label was inadequate to tell me not to
do it. Is that your obligation completely? You don't
have an obligation to show that this particular
manufacturer knew that in some way?
MR. BOGRAD: Well, under most -- under the
law of most States, and this is true in both Louisiana
and Minnesota, there is a reasonableness element in a
failure to warn claim, but it's -- the standard is "knew
or should have known," so that the manufacturer --
manufacturers are typically held to the -- to the
knowledge of an expert in the field of the products they
manufacture. And here the -- our contention has been
that if the generic manufacturers had merely examined
the publicly available FDA database of adverse event
reports, and merely paid attention to reports in the
published literature that had since 19 -- the early
90s had documented a serious association between
long-term use of metoclopramide and tardive dyskinesia,
they would have had more than sufficient information to
say to the agency, we need a change here.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Does a generic manufacturer
have to be an expert in the field in which it
manufactures?
MR. BOGRAD: Under State law, yes, it does,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What does -- what does
being an expert mean?
MR. BOGRAD: It means --
JUSTICE SCALIA: In this context, being an
expert means being able to produce exactly the drug that
has been approved by the FDA, right? You don't have to
be expert in anything else?
MR. BOGRAD: That's incorrect, Your Honor.
They have to be --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What else do they need?
MR. BOGRAD: They have to remain informed of
the dangers posed by the products they sell. They have
obligations --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make them an
expert. I'm talking about what expertise does -- does
the company have to -- to possess. It surely has to
possess the chemical expertise to produce exactly the
product that the -- that the -- that has been approved
by the FDA. What other expertise is necessary?
MR. BOGRAD: Well, Your Honor, one of their
obligations under Federal law is to go to the agency
every year and identify significant new information that
would affect the safety or efficacy or labeling of their
product, which means they have to have the capacity to
evaluate information that is out there, and that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that'd take
any expertise. You have people who complain, I've taken
-- I've taken your pill, and it -- it, you know, it's
caused -- this is expertise? That's not what I normally
think of. Whereas a drug manufacturer does, indeed,
require expertise, conducting tests and knowing what
changes will produce what results and so forth; right?
MR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor. In fact, in
this particular context we're talking about a use that
was never approved by the FDA. We're talking about use
beyond 12 weeks, which had never been evaluated. So
there's really no basis to assume that the name-brand
manufacturer here had any more expertise --
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose they had. Suppose
that -- is a generic required to file adverse incident
reports?
MR. BOGRAD: Yes, they are, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, imagine a
company that files every adverse incident report,
complies completely; period. Now, in your view does it
have an additional obligation?
MR. BOGRAD: Yes, it does, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: And what is that?
MR. BOGRAD: It has an obligation under
1.57(e) to initiate a label change --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MR. BOGRAD: -- process whenever it has
reasonable --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, their argument is that
in respect to their failure to do the first, that's
Buckman. That is similar to Buckman.
MR. BOGRAD: All right. If we -- we were
talking about --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now. And that's what I --
now, as to the second, it just doesn't add anything.
The FDA has all that information.
MR. BOGRAD: Oh, that's -- that's incorrect,
Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, why is it?
MR. BOGRAD: It's -- well, as this Court
said in Levine, the FDA has 11,000 drugs it needs to
monitor and stay on top of, and it doesn't have the
resources necessary to pay attention to every adverse
event report it gets and every report that is published
in the scientific literature. The reason that
manufacturers bear the primary responsibility is because
they -- they need to trigger the FDA's focus on a
particular issue here. Here this information was
available since the mid '90s.
JUSTICE BREYER: Your basic argument, I'm
getting this now, that -- I think -- is that the
failure is, where State law has a right to enter, is to
require them to keep track of adverse incidents and
other things in the -- and do their best to change the
label, which will consist of going to the FDA, likely,
and asking them to change.
MR. BOGRAD: Exactly, Your Honor. Their
obligation -- their obligation under State law is to
provide a warning. What they should have done, and if
you take -- what they should have done is go to the FDA
and ask the FDA to approve a stronger warning. If the
FDA had said no, they would have a preemption.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --
JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose a generic -- suppose
that the FDA issued a rule that says a generic drug
manufacturer has no obligation to request a change in
labeling. Could a generic drug manufacturer be held
liable on a failure to warn claim on the theory that it
could have lobbied the FDA to change the rule that says
that the generic drug manufacturer has no obligation to
ask for a change in labeling?
MR. BOGRAD: I -- I don't have an immediate
answer to that, Justice Alito. The -- the -- the State
-- the -- I -- the question is whether there would be a
direct conflict between State and Federal law. It seems
to me unless -- I'm sorry. Oh, that's the 5 minute
light.
Unless the --
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that why -- isn't that
where your theory leads?
MR. BOGRAD: My -- my theory leads to the --
to the proposition that, unless Federal law precludes
them from -- from going to the process of strengthening
their warning label, then the State may legitimately
enforce its obligation to protect its citizens' health
and safety. I think it's important in this regard --
JUSTICE ALITO: But your theory is that they
have a duty to pursue an informal process that is
nowhere provided for under the FDA rules; and so I don't
-- so it's a duty to lobby the FDA basically to change
the rules, isn't that right?
MR. BOGRAD: Justice Alito, well, as you
know, we disagree with the government about whether
certain formal processes were available. But --
JUSTICE ALITO: Assuming that they're
correct in their interpretation of their own
regulations.
MR. BOGRAD: But assuming -- but -- but if
we're talking -- but there may not be a formal process,
but there is a formal obligation, both under statute,
not to sell a misbranded drug, and under regulation, to
revise your labeling as soon as there's reasonable
evidence of an association of a serious hazard with the
drug. And I think it's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your -- what is
your explanation for why Buckman isn't applicable here?
MR. BOGRAD: Because, Your Honor, this is --
and I should start by saying that in Buckman there was
-- the suit was not against the manufacturer; the suit
in Buckman was against a consultant that -- that helped
the manufacturer get FDA approval. There was a separate
product liability action against the manufacturer that
had already been litigated and settled.
The -- Buckman said: We're not talking
about traditional causes of action, State law causes of
action like in Lohr, or like in -- or as this Court
again said in Wyeth v. Levine; we're talking about a
case where the whole centrality of the claim is premised
on the relationship between the company -- or the
defendant and the agency.
This is not that case. We're -- this case
is about the -- the duty that the company owes to my
clients and their doctors to provide them with adequate
warnings. That duty, which is -- has been recognized by
this Court innumerable times, complements the FDA
statutory scheme by creating incentives for companies
like the Petitioners to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the suit was brought
by the injured person in Buckman.
MR. BOGRAD: But --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's similar in that
respect. And in Buckman there was a -- a formal
relationship which did not permit the cause of action,
and it seems to me you could at least argue that a
fortiori there should be no cause of action when there
an informal relationship.
MR. BOGRAD: I -- I'm not sure I follow the
a fortiori point in this context, Your Honor. But in
Buckman there was no relationship whatsoever between the
consultant, the Buckman Company, and the injured person.
The Buckman Company's dealing were -- had been
exclusively with the agency.
They had had no dealing whatsoever -- they
had not failed to warn. That's why we -- the plaintiffs
had created this bizarre cause of action, and it's -- we
think it's a wholly distinguishable case.
I think it's important to remember, first
off, the world in which we live today. 70 percent of
all prescriptions are filled with generic drugs. A
third of generic drugs no longer have name-brand
competitors at all, because the economic -- because the
name brands have withdrawn from the market, so that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Somebody has been appointed
in all those cases to sort of carry the flag, right?
MR. BOGRAD: Somebody has been appointed to
be the reference-listed drug. They have not been
appointed to have obligations distinct from the other
generic companies as far as updating label claims.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't they have a distinct
obligation to propose labeling changes when they -- when
they think they're necessary?
MR. BOGRAD: I -- Your Honor, that would be
a question better directed to Mr. Kneedler, but I don't
believe -- I don't believe that there's a -- there's a
difference.
Any -- we have a system today where every
State has a drug substitution law that drives
prescriptions to be filled with generics rather than
name-brand products. We have a system where Medicare,
Medicaid, and insurers force or encourage the
substitution of generics through -- through price
incentives. If generics are not responsible, in many of
these cases no one is responsible.
The -- we -- the position that the generics
are proposing here is one in which they would be immune
from liability for selling a product with inadequate
warnings, even though the name-brand company selling the
same drug with the same warnings would be liable. There
is no suggestion anywhere in the record, Your Honor,
anywhere in the legislative history or in the text of
Hatch-Waxman or in FDA regulations that that distinction
was ever contemplated by Congress, that it was ever
sanctioned by the FDA.
I would like to make one final point, Your
Honor. In Bates -- and I apologize; we didn't address
this specifically in our briefs, because I didn't notice
it until later -- the statutory scheme at issue in
Bates, under FIFRA, was almost identical to the -- I'm
sorry. I see my time has expired. May I finish my
point, Your Honor?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your
sentence.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Make it a long sentence,
with a lot of "ands."
(Laughter.)
MR. BOGRAD: There was no CBE equivalent in
Bates in the -- under the FIFRA statutory scheme, and
yet this Court upheld against a motion to dismiss on
preemption grounds a failure to warn claim, admittedly
under an express preemption provision. This Court
upheld a claim against a pesticide manufacturer even
though the pesticide manufacturer could not have changed
its warning without prior EPA approval, exactly the same
situation that confronts the generics here.
Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Kneedler.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments were designed to
facilitate the entry of generic drugs onto the market.
They do not absolve a manufacturer of his
responsibilities after entry onto the market to maintain
the safety of the drug and the adequacy of -- of the
label.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kneedler, suppose
that I'm not sure I agree with you that there is an
obligation of the kind that you say for a generic drug
manufacturer to come forward and request a label, but I
do think that there's an opportunity for that
manufacturer to come forward and ask the FDA to revise a
label. If that's the way I read the law, does your
result follow? Do you think, then, that State law
claims should be able to go forward?
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, we do, because the
ultimate question in the preemption case is whether
there's a conflict. And if the -- if the manufacturer
has an opportunity to come to FDA, even if -- even if
the Court were to conclude it didn't have an obligation
to do so, if it had the opportunity to do so and did
nothing when -- when dramatic evidence, you know, by
hypothesis, came to its attention, it wasn't prohibited
from doing so. There was no --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that the
patient's physician has the same opportunity. Anybody
could go to the FDA and say this label ought to be
changed, right? So the -- the physician taking care of
this plaintiff didn't -- had the opportunity to go to
the FDA and didn't. Is there a cause of action against
him?
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the FDCA does
not regulate the responsibilities of physicians in those
situations. The whole point of the labeling --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about what
the -- the FDCA regulation. We're talking about what
State law would allow, and State law would allow a suit
against the physician because he did not take advantage
of the opportunity to go to the FDA and propose a label
change.
MR. KNEEDLER: No, I think State law
would -- would impose an obligation on the physician to
adequately advise the patient, but what's so different
is, the physician relies upon the labeling. If the
physician has the information, the physician, on his own
initiative, could tell the patient or warn the patient
about what's going on without -- without having to go to
FDA at all.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if your theory of
the case is accepted, this is what will happen: Every
time a generic manufacturer gets an adverse incident
report, it will send that on to the FDA, and there will
be a boilerplate sentence at the end of it saying, We
think you should consider revising the labels because of
this, and then, under your theory, that manufacturer is
completely protected from State suits?
MR. KNEEDLER: Several things. The
manufacturer does, of course, have the obligation to
furnish the adverse event information that it receives.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.
MR. KNEEDLER: But if -- if the standard in
regulation 57(e) is met, where there's evidence,
reasonable evidence, of a serious hazard, it has an
obligation --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're not
going to take a chance. They're going to say, if you're
the FDA, you look at it. We're just telling you what we
know, and we think you ought to consider revising the
label.
MR. KNEEDLER: But they are -- they are to
propose -- in our view, are to propose a labeling
change, which means that the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. We think you
should revise the label; if you agree, this is what it
should look like.
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and we don't -- we don't
think it will lead to a flood of such requirements in
the wake of this --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it lead to
preemption?
MR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it lead to
preemption?
MR. KNEEDLER: If the -- if FDA rejected the
request, there would -- there would be preemption,
because FDA -- it would have been submitted to the
expert agency, as we think is required.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Wouldn't
you -- if you were the generic company's lawyer, you
would advise them to do that in every case, right?
MR. KNEEDLER: I don't think I -- I don't
think in every case. I think it's -- if -- but here,
here we have a situation where, at least according to
the allegations, there were published studies of
long-term use of this product.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know that's
what this case is, but if -- a reasonable generic
manufacturer would be worried about every case, and it
would just add this boilerplate language at the end of
every letter, and as I understand your theory, they
would be protected.
MR. KNEEDLER: It's not just boilerplate
evidence at the bottom of the -- as part of a letter.
What the -- what the Federal Register notice told the
manufacturer to do was to -- was to submit the proposal
to FDA with supporting information. In other words,
suppose it's the sort of submission that would -- that
would be like --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be the -- the
prologue -- the prologue to the rule said that, and the
rule was never submitted for notice and comment. Is
that what you're relying on, that prologue?
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think, to put it
in context, these were the regulations actually
implementing the Hatch-Waxman statute, and there was a
proposal to allow the manufacturers to deviate from
the -- from the NDA holders' label and put their own on
it. And the -- and FDA said, no, you can't do that, but
what you should do is bring it to FDA, and FDA will
decide whether to change the labels for everyone.
And so this was part and parcel of the
notice and comment rulemaking: How should -- how should
a generic manufacturer deal with a situation where it
has information that may deviate from the NDA
holder's -- how should it --
JUSTICE ALITO: Has the FDA made any
calculation of the economic consequences of imposing
this duty on generic drug manufacturers? I don't know
whether this is a good idea or not, but it does seem to
me that it may significantly increase the costs for
generic drug manufacturers, and therefore counteract one
of the objectives of the statute, which was to provide
generic drugs at a low cost.
MR. KNEEDLER: To my knowledge, FDA has not
done an analysis. But it's important to understand the
duty here derives from the misbranding provisions. A
generic drug manufacturer is not exempt from the
misbranding requirements of the act, which prohibit
distributing a drug that does not have adequate --
adequate warnings, and rule 57(e) requiring a
manufacturer to propose a warning or to make a warning
change if there is evidence of a serious hazard
implements that misbranding requirement. So this is not
an imposition by FDA. This is an underlying requirement
of the act.
I would --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I -- am I to
understand -- and I think I am understanding you. There
is a legal obligation in the statute to report adverse
events. You're saying that the statute also requires
every manufacturer, of whatever type, to monitor the
safety of the drug they're selling? Is that what you're
saying?
MR. KNEEDLER: State --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if reasonable
evidence, whether directly in their possession or in the
marketplace --
MR. KNEEDLER: The -- the FDA regulations do
not explicitly require monitoring of literature, but --
but there's no conflict in State law imposing a duty to
do that.
If I -- if I may just discuss Buckman for a
minute, because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you decide whether a
generic manufacturer ought to have proposed a -- a
labeling change?
MR. KNEEDLER: If the standard --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a generic
manufacturer. He doesn't know anything about -- about
science. He knows how to replicate this pill exactly.
That's all -- that's all he really knows.
Now, what is the test you're going to impose
to -- to a jury to decide whether this generic
manufacturer ought to have -- ought to have proposed a
labeling change?
MR. KNEEDLER: It's the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it, well, you
know, if he had been as well armed scientifically as the
original manufacturer of the labeled drug, he should
have known or, you know, does this guy who graduated
from high school and can replicate a pill, should he
have known? What -- what's the --
MR. KNEEDLER: It's the standard in 57(e) if
there's evidence of a serious hazard, we think State law
can impose on a generic manufacturer which is putting a
potentially dangerous product on the market the
obligation to -- to investigate.
I would -- I would like to talk about
Buckman for just a minute, please, because it's -- it's
come up. Buckman is fundamentally different. There was
no independent State law duty to warn at issue in
Buckman. It was solely a tort based on lying to the
FDA. It is a tort that depended entirely on the
existence of the FDA.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in the brief --
and in the brief that you filed you said one of the
concerns is that people are going to flood the FDA with
all these warnings and -- and whatever, and that would
interfere with the FDA's ability. Now you're telling
me -- you -- you said when you started out that you
think it's unlikely or you don't think it's likely. In
your brief it said SG language you said we're not
prepared to predict that a ruling would do this.
So, why is that a difference between those
two cases?
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, Buckman was a situation
of a collateral attack on a decision that had actually
been made by FDA. There was no independent duty --
State law or duty to warn, no relationship between the
person submitting information to FDA. It was just a
State making the tort to lie to the FDA, and you would
have had the State regulating nothing but the
relationship between the manufacturer and FDA.
Here State law is regulating the
relationship between the manufacturer and -- and the
patient through the doctor, and that's a traditional
area of State regulation, duty to warn, and, Justice
Kagan, I think you're right, the question then is
whether there is an affirmative defense of -- of
preemption, and the preemption comes in. It's very
different from Buckman in that situation.
It's up to the defendant to prove, it's not
an element of the cause of action as in Buckman. It's
part of the defense for the defendant to prove that --
that it is -- that the cause of action is preempted.
And in our view it's not preempted if the
standard in 57(e) is met to propose a labeling change
that is an obligation that extends to all manufacturers
generic or not.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's
not -- the regulation doesn't say propose a labeling
change. It says labeling shall be revised, and the one
thing we know is that the generic manufacturer can't
revise the labeling from the branded one.
MR. KNEEDLER: It can't revise the labeling,
but that doesn't mean it can do nothing. Impossibility
preemption kicks in only when it's genuinely impossible,
and if the manufacturer could go to FDA and propose a
labeling change, it is not impossible for to it do that.
At that point it's up to FDA and preemption would kick
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Kneedler.
Mr. Lefkowitz, you have your 5 minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Thank you.
Mr. Kneedler has basically postulated a
situation where we're going to have jury trials about
whether a Federal duty to the FDA was breached. And
it's interesting, he says that this isn't Buckman, but
of course, Buckman involved the same duty not to sell a
dangerous product, and the same issue of lack of
disclosure to the FDA.
Now, he says it was a collateral attack, but
actually that was the premise of Justice Stevens'
concurrence, where Justice Stevens said I get to the
same result for a different reason. What the Court said
was nothing about a collateral attack.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the difference,
as I see it, is that they're not suing you for a failure
to tell the FDA. They're suing you for a failure to
tell them. It's you who are interposing a defense and
saying I manufacture a dangerous drug, and I have no
obligation to monitor and ensure that the label is
accurate.
And what the government is saying, as I
understand it is, no, you do. Yes, we understand you
want to sell more cheaply, but not at the cost of public
health.
So what's wrong with that argument?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Sotomayor,
respectfully, what's wrong with the premises, if they're
claiming failure to warn, it's a very simple case of
impossibility preemption. We couldn't warn, and the
government's brief makes clear we had no ability to
warn.
What the government is now doing is it's
taking a regulation, 201.57, which doesn't say the word
"ask" in it. It actually says "revise." And it says
revise because it's a regulation written for brand
manufacturers that have the CBE option available to
them, and they are then trying to incorporate the words
"duty to ask" through this brief without, as Justice
Alito says, taking into any account through notice and
comment rulemaking the effect of this.
Well, we know that there are over 1,600
requests for labeling revisions pending at the FDA now,
0 of them are pending for more than 6 months. And at
the relevant time of this case, Your Honor, not only
would we have had to ask the FDA, but then the FDA would
have had to negotiate with the brand, because prior to
the FDAAA amendments, the FDA couldn't order a brand to
change, so we would have had to make the request, the
FDA would have had to negotiate the brand change, and
then we would have had to follow.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, if you
had asked, you would be in a different situation. If
you had asked and the FDA had sat on it or was
negotiating, then you could say, look, we've done all we
can right now. But you're not in that situation. You,
in fact, have not done all you can right now to change
the label because you never wrote that letter.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, and again just
to pick up on -- on what Chief Justice Roberts said and
Justice Scalia said, we have done everything we are
required to do, which is to provide all of the
information about adverse reports that we have and all
of the results of our investigations to the government.
And if the government wants to impose a new duty through
notice and comment rulemaking saying, and now we have a
duty to ask for a label change, in addition --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government is taking
the position that there's no clash between the
government, the State, and Federal law. It's not saying
that you commit some kind of Federal offense if you
don't file this law. The government is saying, the
question is preemption. Is there a clash between
Federal and State law to traditional Federal warn you
have a preemption defense if you tell the FDA, and if
either the FDA does nothing or tells you, no, we're not
going to change the label?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, Buckman makes
very clear that a State trying to regulate disclosure
obligations to the Federal Government is simply off
limits, and in fact --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the -- Buckman was
about, was a -- it was a very odd case to be brought
under State law for fraud on a Federal agency.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, it was a case
brought by a plaintiff who was injured claiming that the
company had not made proper, adequate disclosures to the
FDA. It's the same thing here, and I just want to
point --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Lefkowitz, do you agree
with Justice Ginsburg's characterization of the
government's position? I thought the government was
saying that there was an obligation on the part of the
generics to propose changes.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely. What they are
saying --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Otherwise, the government
would be saying you have an obligation to lobby, and I
don't think they're saying that.
MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, in a sense the
government is really saying we -- to lobby or to propose
changes is a -- is a very fine distinction. Clearly,
what the government is now saying is they are reading a
regulation that they've always interpreted as being only
applicable to brand companies and saying now it's
applicable to their companies and it incorporates new
language that says not just revise but ask.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Lefkowitz. Counsel, the case is submitted.
