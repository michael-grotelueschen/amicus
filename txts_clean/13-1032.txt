CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument first this morning in Case No. 13-1032, Direct
Marketing Association v. Brohl, Executive Director,
Colorado Department of Revenue.
Mr. Isaacson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. ISAACSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ISAACSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The matter before the Court today concerns
the scope and application of the Tax Injunction Act, a
law passed by Congress in 1937 for the purpose of
preventing State taxpayers from circumventing
State-established and available procedures for
challenging State tax assessments and instead, going
directly to Federal court seeking to invoke the equity
powers of Federal courts to enjoin the assessment and
enforcement of State tax laws.
The matter before the Court is one of
statutory construction.  In 2010, the State of Colorado
passed legislation that had three components to it.  It
was directed at exclusively out-of-State retailers and
required those retailers who made sales to Colorado
residents and did not collect Colorado use tax to first
provide a transaction notice in connection with each
sale to a Colorado customer informing them of their
obligation to self-report the use tax to the Colorado
Department of Revenue; and then on an annual basis to
send a mailing to Colorado customers informing them of
all purchases that they made during the past year and,
again, reiterating the requirement that they inform the
Department of Revenue of their tax obligations; and
third, for those out-of-State retailers affected by the
law, to report to the Colorado Department of Revenue all
of the customer transaction information that occurred
during the past year for each Colorado customer.
The case has an interesting procedural
history which I think is of relevance both to the Tax
Injunction Act and also to the issue of comity.  The
executive director did not raise the Tax Injunction Act
at the district court level and did not challenge the
jurisdiction of the district court.
When the district court entered a permanent
injunction enjoining enforcement of the Colorado statute
and it was appealed by the executive director, the
executive director, in her briefing to the Tenth
Circuit, expressly informed the court that the Tax
Injunction Act and comity did not apply and were not a
bar to the Federal appellate court proceeding to hear
the case.
When the appeal was made on a petition for
certiorari to this Court, in her brief in opposition to
the petition for certiorari, the executive director
explained that the reason that she did not raise the
jurisdictional issue below was because she favored
having an expedited hearing on this matter so that
the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it often happens.
It's a jurisdictional issue.  So what's the point?
MR. ISAACSON:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, the fact that she
didn't raise it is irrelevant.  In fact, even -- even if
she didn't raise it here, we would have to raise it
here, wouldn't we?
MR. ISAACSON:  I believe that certainly for
purposes of comity, Your Honor, the decision on the part
of the government to seek the resolution of the matter
in -- in a court is -- constitutes effectively a waiver
of -- of the comity question.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, the comity, okay.  And
you -- you agree it has nothing to do with the -- with
the principal question?
MR. ISAACSON:  No.  I believe that under the
Tax Injunction Act, if the State affirmatively seeks the
relief from the Court, that it -- it can -- it can
proceed.  And in -- in this case, I think that it's
especially --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse -- if the -- if
the -- would the State be seeking the relief?
MR. ISAACSON:  Yes.  In this case --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The State would be seeking
to enjoin its own tax?
MR. ISAACSON:  What -- what the State --
State sought was a summary judgment.  They affirmatively
moved for summary judgment at the district court level.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but that -- that just
means the district court should throw it out.  I mean,
I --
MR. ISAACSON:  But that wasn't the request
on summary judgment.  The summary judgement was a
request for the court to address the merits of the case,
not to dismiss the case on jurisdictional grounds.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Actually, you have
raised the very question I started with, which is the
waiver question.  Is it your position that the T -- that
the TIA is a waivable protection?  Is that what you're
arguing?
MR. ISAACSON:  I think -- I think the issue
may not be expressly one of waiver, but may be one of
consent to agreeing to--
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Either way consent or --
it probably is consent.  If it is consensual, what
you're suggesting is that the reason for the TIA is not
jurisdictional in its traditional sense, but one based
on comity that can be -- that can be consented to.
MR. ISAACSON:  That's correct.  And I
believe, Justice Sotomayor, that the Court has made
clear, including in the -- in the Fair Assessment case,
Fair Assessment v. McNary, that the Tax Injunction Act
is really a codified subset of the law of comity.  So
that the TIA did not supplant or replace comity, but
instead codified a certain element of comity.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the statute's addressed
to the courts.  And the statute says the courts will not
enjoin State -- State taxes.  Now, how -- how can that
mandate to the court be altered by -- by private
parties?
MR. ISAACSON:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me it says that
we just don't have the power, period.  But you say the
States can give us the power?
MR. ISAACSON:  I believe they can.
But in addition to that, Justice Scalia, I
think what is significant about the fact that the
executive director took the position both before the
appellate court and before this Court in the opposition
to the petition for certiorari of saying that this
Court -- that the reason why they decided to proceed was
they wanted an expedited hearing.
What I think it is remarkably reflective of
is the opinion or the view of the executive director
that the Tax Injunction Act does not apply to this
situation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's -- that's
fine.  I -- I can understand that.  You say they used to
think that it didn't apply, now they're saying it
applies.  I agree, that's a good argument.
But you're arguing much beyond that.  You're
arguing that it doesn't matter any more because they
once said that they wanted the Court to decide it, even
though the Court had no power to decide it, right?  I
mean, that's a different argument.  It's that one that I
criticize.  If you want to say the State's argument
seems weaker because they've changed their mind, that's
fair enough.
MR. ISAACSON:  Well, I -- I think the
State's argument is weaker not merely because they
changed their mind, but because I think they made a
studied decision that the Tax Injunction Act, by its
terms, and what the Court is presented with is an issue
of statutory construction as construed by the executive
director to the point of informing both the appellate
court and -- and this Court that the Tax Injunction Act
was not a jurisdictional bar.  I think that that was
reflective of the fact that -- that the position of the
State, especially in the absence of any precedent
supporting the very broad position that the Tenth
Circuit assumed on its own, that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Isaacson, can we get
to the nub of this question?  We have your petition, the
fact it is a restriction on the Court's jurisdiction.
But you recognize that the TIA does cover
regulations that require an employer to report an
employer's -- an employee's taxable income.  That's a
straight reporting requirement, and you recognize that
that's covered by the TIA.  So this is another
information reporting that will enable or facilitate the
State's collection of its tax.  So what's the
difference?  Why -- why is it that the one comes under
the TIA and not the other?
MR. ISAACSON:  So I believe, Justice
Ginsburg, those cases that you're referring to, like the
Blangeres case and the Sipe's case, are situations in
which it was the taxpayer that was seeking to prevent
that information-reporting from taking place.  And it is
clear that in those cases it was doing so for the
purposes of anticipating a tax assessment, and
attempting to prevent the issuance of that -- that
assessment by depriving the director of -- of necessary
information.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But suppose it weren't the
taxpayer.  I mean, suppose a State has a form that's
equivalent to the Federal W-2, requiring employers to
say how much wages have been paid.  And suppose the
employer itself challenges the use of that form, what do
you think the result is in that case?
MR. ISAACSON:  In that case, I believe that
the Tax Injunction Act would bar -- the Tax Injunction
Act would not bar Federal court jurisdiction.  I think
that that would be the classic situation that was
described by the Court in Levin v. Commerce Energy
where --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so you say the words
"assessment" and "levy" in the statute apply only to
taxpayers.
MR. ISAACSON:  No.  There are situations in
which there may be proxies that are acting on behalf of
the taxpayer so that you could have a situation, for --
for example, where you have a successor in interest to a
taxpayer that may be bringing the claim.  But in all of
those situations, they are ones in which -- and this is
the case law regarding the Tax Injunction Act -- that
they are all situations in which the taxpayer or the
person acting on behalf of the taxpayer is bringing an
action --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  My very point.  So what?
Go ahead.
JUSTICE BREYER:  The question is whether the
word "collection" includes an injunction that makes it
more difficult for the State to collect the tax.  And in
the case that Justice Ginsburg brought up, the
injunction, because it would stop the -- the employer
from telling the State how much has been earned, would
make it more difficult to collect the tax.
In this case, the injunction, by stopping
sellers from telling the State how much the Colorado
citizen has bought, would make it more difficult for
them to collect the tax.  So if collection includes in
the one case an injunction that makes it more difficult
to collect an income tax, why doesn't it in this case
include an injunction that makes it more difficult to
collect a use tax?  The point was they are identical
conceptually.
Now, I don’t care whether it's -- who --
who brings the suit.  In terms of the word "collection,"
they seem identical.  Now, what is your response to that
question, which is what I think was being asked?
MR. ISAACSON:  So, Justice Breyer, I think
you have to read the word "injunction," which is the
first set of operative words --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't say anywhere
"injunction."
MR. ISAACSON:  Enjoin.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What the word is, "enjoin,"
"suspend" or "restrain."  And I get -- I'm totally with
you on those, but what you are enjoining, suspend -- you
are enjoining something.  There is an injunction that
says the State cannot enforce its provision requiring
out-of-State sellers to report what Colorado customers
buy.  I don't see how you can deny that's an injunction.
I think you could deny that it enjoins the collection of
a tax.  But to do that, you will have to go right back
to the question that Justice Ginsburg asked, and tell me
how to distinguish the two cases she mentioned.  This
one and the case where it's reporting income by an
in-State citizen.
MR. ISAACSON:  So the words "enjoin" and
"suspend" operate on the words "assessment," "levy" and
"collection."
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. ISAACSON:  And as this Court ruled in
the -- in the Hibbs case, in which even though the Court
was divided on the issue of the meaning of the term
"assessment," which was the key issue in -- in that
case, that the assessment is the recording of liability.
And this Court also ruled in -- in -- in the
Hibbs case that assessment triggers collection.  So in
the Tax Injunction Act, the word "collection" is
referring to actions of government officials following
the assessment of the tax.  And the injunction that --
that Your Honor is referring to is one which is relating
to the actions of third parties, private parties, not
government officials.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So your point is that if,
in fact, there is in Colorado a law somewhat like
Federal law that says all employers must report to the
State the wages that in this Boulder area, or Denver, we
pay our employees and someone tries to enjoin that law
in Federal court, you are saying they can do it.  Right?
It doesn't matter whether it's use, out of the State or
employment within the State, and we simply have to
accept that consequence because of Hibbs.
MR. ISAACSON:  Well, in the W-2 concept,
what Justice Kagan was referring to, there's a tax
liability responsibility that the employer themselves
have, so that I think that a court might well conclude
that because of the obligation --
JUSTICE BREYER:  1099s.
MR. ISAACSON:  In that situation, I think if
it's a third party, that third party is an outsider as
this Court defined outsider, an individual whose own tax
liability is not of relevance.  And I think in the
context of the Tax Injunction Act, it's been
consistently been interpreted that -- that way, that all
of the cases that have been cited by the executive
director, whether those cases address specifically the
tax assessment or some liability, are all cases that
were brought by a taxpayer and the issue related to what
that taxpayer's liabilities --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What about the Alexander v.
Americans United case under the Anti-Injunction Act?
That was not -- that was a third-party suit, wasn't it?
An organization was -- wanted -- wanted a determination
that contributions would be tax deductible.
MR. ISAACSON:  Right.  I think in Americans
United, the -- the plaintiff in that case was, one,
determining its own 50(c) status and so it was
interested in what its own status was.  But I think
in -- in addition to that, you had a -- an underlying
tax statute that was at issue.  The issue concerned the
question of eligibility for tax-exempt status.
What I think is significant in this case is
not only the fact that you have an obligation that is
not borne by taxpayers but is imposed exclusively on
non-taxpayers, but it also is not a tax statute.  It's a
statute that's --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But where -- where do you
get, Mr. Isaacson, this idea that the -- the plaintiff
has to be the taxpayer?  Because certainly the text of
the statute does not say that.  The text of the statute
speaks to what kinds of remedies a court can give.  It
does not speak to what kind of plaintiffs have to bring
the lawsuit.
MR. ISAACSON:  I think the discussion of the
Tax Injunction Act in the Levin case, Levin v. Commerce
Energy, where a group is identified as outsiders,
individuals or entities whose own tax liability is not
of relevance to the -- to the case, is the source of --
of that authority.
And in this case, that's exactly the
situation that you have, that we're not talking about
the tax liability of out-of-State retailers.  Their tax
liability is irrelevant.  Furthermore, those
out-of-State retailers are not challenging anyone's tax
liability, which I think is also a distinction from the
American United's case where they were -- they were
concerned about the tax liabilities of contributors to
their organization.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I don't -- what I
don't understand about your statutory argument, I mean,
it seems a kind of natural thing for somebody to say
suppose it's like we're going to all have pizza tonight,
and we're going to take up a collection to buy the
pizza.  And I assign one of my clerks, go collect the
money for the pizza.
So what that clerk is going to do is he's
going to figure out who it is that's going to owe the
money, right?  Who's going to partake of the pizza, so
who owes the money.  And then, you know, maybe he's
going to send an e-mail to those people and he's going
to say you owe this money for pizza.  And then if no --
if somebody doesn't pay, he's going to identify the
delinquent and -- and say, really, you owe this money
for pizza.
So that's all part of the collection
process, isn't it?  I mean, basically, identifying --
informing the -- the people who have to pay, informing
the people who have to pay and identifying the people
who don't pay, and -- and the amounts that they owe.
MR. ISAACSON:  I think two responses,
Justice Kagan.  One, the terms "collection,"
"assessment," "levy," and "collection" are terms of art
that have particular relevance in tax parlance, just as
the terms "enjoin," "suspend" have particular relevance
in regard to the Court's equity powers.
So in this situation, what collection is
referring to, and it's consistent with how the Internal
Revenue Code treats the term "collection," it's the
action that is taken by tax authorities, by government
officials, after a determination of tax liability has
been made, after notice has been given to the taxpayer
of their obligation, and it's the efforts of the
government to then recover the amount of money which is
owed.
The fact that there may be information which
is of use, of relevance that may precede the collection
activity of the government doesn't convert those
preliminary activities into collection itself.  So I
think what -- what is -- is really critical on this --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you're saying that
collection is only as the money changes hands, that
that's the only thing that constitutes collection?
MR. ISAACSON:  No.  What I'm saying is that
collection follows assessment, and after the assessment
has occurred, it is the activities of government
officials in order to recover money from taxpayers.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so you're
saying it's just like garnishment or things like that?
It has to be focused on a specific amount that's already
been calculated and the taxpayer has not turned over?
MR. ISAACSON:  It -- it certainly goes far
beyond garnishment and would include any activities on
the part of government officials once the taxpayer's
liability has been determined.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you've got to
know that he or she owes $1,482 because they've done the
calculations and they haven't paid that over.
MR. ISAACSON:  Yes.  As -- as this Court
decided in the -- in the Hibbs case, the decision
written by Justice Ginsburg, it's assessment that
triggers collection, so that they -- they fall in
sequence to each other.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I'm not sure what --
what you have conceded.  Do you acknowledge that if
there were a State law which required in-State sellers
not to collect the tax, but just to advise the -- the
State revenue service that someone has purchased an item
on which tax is due, would you acknowledge that that
could be enjoined?  That someone could bring a suit
saying, I'm not the taxpayer, this is not the assessment
or collection of a tax, and therefore you -- a suit will
lie for me to say that this is an unconstitutional
assessment or imposition upon me.  Would that suit lie
or not?
MR. ISAACSON:  Well, I'm not sure what the
basis, the underlying basis for Federal jurisdiction
would be in -- in the hypothetical that -- that you
have --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's -- it's a
Federal constitutional violation.
MR. ISAACSON:  I think if it's a Federal
constitutional violation, the Tax Injunction Act would
not be a bar to it.  Now, I think in that situation, you
may have comity concerns that are significantly
different than the potential comity concerns in -- in
this circumstance.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the only thing that
would make the States able to do -- to get information
about tax liability without being sued in Federal court
is the fact that the person from whom the information is
sought is liable for the tax, if the seller has to
retain the sales tax.
MR. ISAACSON:  Well, as I -- as I pointed
out, there may be circumstances in which you have a
third party that is effectively acting in regard to a
taxpayer's liability.  So I think you have -- you have
two convergences, Justice Scalia, that I think are
important to the resolution of this case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what you mean
by a third party acting in regard to --
MR. ISAACSON:  It could be a successor in
interest, for example.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, of course.
MR. ISAACSON:  But I think you have two
convergences here that would -- would not necessarily be
present in the hypothetical that you present.  One is
you have a non-taxpayer that -- that is one of the
elements of it.  But also, that that non-taxpayer is not
disputing anyone's liability.  So, you know, I think one
of the issues that was present in -- in the Hibbs v.
Winn case, and I think it was part of the concern that
Justice Kennedy had in his dissent in that case, is that
you were still having a so-called outsider that was
interested in the tax liability of another party.
In the current case, the issue of tax
liability of the customers of the out-of-State retailers
is not being contested.  The -- the out-of-State
retailers normally are not disputing any issue relating
to their own tax liability -- there is none -- but they
are also not claiming that their customers are not
subject to use tax.  They are not challenge --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the -- the State's not
interested in just liability.  It's interested in
collecting, and the statute talks about collection.
MR. ISAACSON:  Absolutely.  And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So it seems to me that
that -- that's just not responsive to the issue.
MR. ISAACSON:  No, I -- I agree with you,
Justice Kennedy, that the -- in this case the Direct
Marketing Association members are not challenging the
authority of the State to pursue collection of tax
revenues from customers.  They're not contesting --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We're talking not about
what you're challenging, we're talking about what the
State's interest is.
MR. ISAACSON:  The fact that the State has
an interest in this information and much of the briefing
that the State has presented emphasizes the importance
of this -- of this information to -- to their tax
system.  But the fact that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it's importance for a
reason.  It's importance to enable them to collect.
Essentially the State is saying we're not going to be
able to collect this tax unless we do these things,
unless we tell people that they, in fact, owe the tax
and unless we have a mechanism to make sure that people
who don't pay the tax are identified.  And that's what
all these forms are all about.  It's about collecting a
tax that most people do not pay.
MR. ISAACSON:  I'm not sure that the State
is saying they're not able to collect the tax absent
this information.  In fact, the anticipated revenue on
the revenue note that went with this was twelve and a half million
dollars, it was less than 2/10ths of 1 percent of the
total State -- State revenues.
But assuming for the moment that the State
does believe that this is important information,
valuable information, that doesn't mean that it fits
within the language of what was excluded by the Tax
Injunction Act from Federal court jurisdiction.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But wouldn't you agree that
in any case in which a -- a government goes about
collecting the tax it has to say how are we going to
collect this tax.  And this is just this State's answer
to the how are we going to collect this tax.  Well, what
we're going to do is that we're going to inform people
that they owe the tax and then we're going to get
information that enables us to make sure that the
delinquents pay up.  That's how we're going to collect
it.
MR. ISAACSON:  I believe the -- I believe
the issue that the Court is confronted with is in the
construction of this statute in regard to what the
meaning of the word "collection" means in the context of
being associated with assessment, levy, and collection.
What is the act of collection?  Not what is the interest
of the State in being able to pursue collection, but
what is the act of collection that is enjoined.  And I
think that is what is determinative of whether there's
a -- a Federal forum to be able to address that issue.
If there are no further questions,
Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the remainder of
my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Domenico.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL D. DOMENICO
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. DOMENICO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Justice Kagan, this injunction has deprived
Colorado of the tool provided by the State legislature
under State law for the assessment and collection of
these taxes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Am I correct that Colorado
is the only State that seeks to do this with respect to
out-of-State sellers?
MR. DOMENICO:  Colorado is the only State
with this precise combination --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that's amazing.  If
indeed this is a, you know, a proper operation, why
wouldn't all 50 -- in my experience, you know, if it
moves, you tax it.  And I --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I cannot imagine that the
other States have not piled on with this thing if it
is -- if it is so essential to the tax system and if
there are no problems with -- with doing it.  My
goodness.
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, of course, the question
on the merits is whether there are, in fact, problems
with it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  I understand.
MR. DOMENICO:  And --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the fact that it's --
it's a one of a kind gives me some pause.  This is
certainly a -- a very important case because I have no
doubt that if we come out agreeing with you, every one
of the States is going to pass laws like this.
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, I would agree with
that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And all sellers will also
have to be providing this information.
MR. DOMENICO:  Certainly, I think if we
ultimately prevail on the merits, that's true.  The
question is whether that challenge on the merits goes
through Federal or State courts.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's assume I am a not --
not-for-profit -- an unpopular not-for-profit
corporation that has members who don't -- who don't want
their identity known because hurtful things will be done
to them.  And I make a sale which would -- would be
exempt from Colorado's laws if indeed it was made by a
not-for-profit organization to one of its members.  And
Colorado demands from this organization the names of its
members.  And you tell me that cannot get into -- I'm
claiming a First Amendment objection to turning over the
names of my members, and you tell me that cannot get
into Federal court.
MR. DOMENICO:  Justice Scalia, I'm telling
you that cannot get into Federal court.  That is a
part -- a central part of the State's tax system, it may
very well be unconstitutional on the merits.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It can't be that central if
no other State has it.
MR. DOMENICO:  Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How central can it be?
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, Justice Scalia, the use
tax is obviously a large and growing portion of -- of
the tax base that States should be able to collect.  And
Colorado has been unable, except in per -- in a
minuscule percentage, 0 to 5 percent are the estimates,
of who actually pays this tax, are paying it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm -- I'm a little bit
confused.  In the normal tax situation, meaning my
employer, the U.S. Courts, removes taxes from whatever
area I declare is -- is my residency.
MR. DOMENICO:  That's right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Is my
employer required to send that information to the State
government?  I don't think it is.  I think I'm required
to send my W-2.
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, it comes indirectly,
that the States typically get that information from the
IRS.  So it is an obligation.  It's just sort of, I
think, indirect.  So we do --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So there is no -- okay.
Is -- that's what I thought.
Now, the -- some employers have to withhold
taxes --
MR. DOMENICO:  Correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- for certain entities
in which they're resident or working.
MR. DOMENICO:  Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so that's because of
jurisdictional powers.
MR. DOMENICO:  That's right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The State can control
someone who is within their jurisdiction.
MR. DOMENICO:  Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that makes sense to
me.  What doesn't is how can we apply the TIA to an
entity that has no direct responsibility to you?
When -- and you have no jurisdictional control over
them.  I mean, there is a presumption in the TIA that
collection, assessment, et cetera, is going to be
against an entity that owes you something.
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, the -- I don't think
that the TIA says that.  The TIA talks first about
enjoining, restraining or suspending.  Then it talks --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How are -- how are they
enjoined?  You can collect everything you want against
your taxpayer over you have -- over your having
jurisdiction.  So how are we restraining you from --
we're not giving you information, but this injunction is
not stopping you from collecting that tax.
MR. DOMENICO:  It is stopping us from using
the tool -- the means provided under Colorado law for
assessing and collecting that tax.  There may -- I'm
sorry.  Go ahead.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's -- let's assume a
State law that gives the State taxing authority a lot of
money for new computers, and somebody challenges that
law on some State ground, whatever it is.  Would that
challenge -- on some Federal ground.  Would that
challenge not be able to be brought in Federal court
because the computers are going to help the tax service
to get more delinquent taxpayers and, therefore, you are
restraining the collection of taxes?
MR. DOMENICO:  I don't think so, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why not?
MR. DOMENICO:  The circuit courts have --
have addressed these types of questions much more often
than this Court have, and they've uniformly -- at least
eight of them that have addressed that kind of question
have drawn essentially the same line.  It's the one
expressed in cases like Kemlon and Judicial Watch, and
the question they ask is, is the action you're
attacking, is the purpose of that action, the State
action, is the purpose -- is it intended to culminate in
assessment or collection of taxes and is the likely
effect to culminate --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That isn't a very narrowing
thing.  I mean, Henry Friendly, some years ago, said of
course you can use the term collection to refer to any
method of helping to secure payment.  But Congress was
referring to methods similar to assessing and levy that
would produce money or other property directly rather
than indirectly.  The reason being, once we start down
your road, there is no stopping place.
MR. DOMENICO:  I don't think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  GDP consists of about
$16 trillion.  It's very hard to think of even one of
those trillion dollars that you couldn't figure out
passed through somebody's hands who owed a tax and then
later went into somebody else's hands and it would help
the State or the Federal government to know from that
second or third person how it got the money from the
first person's hands.  That's true of houses.  It's true
of food.  It's true of -- in States that tax food.  It's
true of this desk.  It's true of everything you can
think of.  And therefore, there will be -- I mean, ruled
out, unless you are going to start line drawing, and I
don't know what lines to draw.
Therefore, said Henry Friendly, let's not.
Let us read collection to mean what it means in context,
namely what Hibbs suggests the three phrases mean.  Read
them together.  That, I think, is the strongest argument
against you and, therefore, I would like to hear your
response.
MR. DOMENICO:  Justice Breyer, I agree with
you, that's the strongest argument against us.  This
injunction makes it impossible for Colorado, under the
State law that the legislature has enacted, to do any
form of assessment, any form of collection on hundreds
of--
JUSTICE BREYER:  Really, you can't ask your
citizens the same way that the Federal government asks
us?  "Pay," that's their polite way of saying it.  And
by the way, if you fill out your form incorrectly,
depending upon your state of mind, you may discover you
are in prison.
Now, that seems to be a not-perfect way of
doing it, but it does tend to encourage people to pay
the taxes that they believe they owe.
MR. DOMENICO:  Justice Breyer, indirectly,
at least, Colorado makes the same statement to its
citizens about this tax, but it can't determine who owes
the tax and it can't determine how much they owe, and
it therefore --
understand.
JUSTICE BREYER:  If they tell you the truth.
MR. DOMENICO:  That would be nice.
JUSTICE BREYER:  This is the west.  I
I don't -- I'm from the west.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can it make the -- the
foreign seller collect the tax?
MR. DOMENICO:  Not under Quill.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that is sort of
strange.  It can't make them collect it, but it -- it
has the power to compel them, non -- non-State citizens,
out-of-State people, provide the information, assist in
the State's collection of the tax?  I don't know why --
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, this is exactly --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know why the one
and not the other.
MR. DOMENICO:  This is exactly their
argument on the merits.  But that is exactly why this
violates the Tax Injunction Act  because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Couldn't we --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask a question about
where your argument might lead?  I think you
acknowledged earlier that if we hold that your statute
cannot be challenged under the Tax Injunction Act and
it's ultimately determined to be constitutional, this
would be very attractive for all the other States to
copy.
So let's -- let's suppose that that happens
and so now every State has a law like this, and every
State -- and there are many different variations in the
forms.  Maybe there are 50 forms that have to be
submitted to State tax authorities.  And let's say I
start up a small business and I'm selling a few thousand
dollars worth of goods via the internet to people from
all over the country.
Now I will have to submit potentially 50
different forms to all of these States reporting that
somebody in South Carolina purchased something from me
that cost 23.99.  Now, I know you have a -- you have a
requirement that it has to reach a certain threshold,
but I don't see it and that's just something that you've
chosen to do.  But that's where this all could lead,
couldn't it?
MR. DOMENICO:  Justice Alito, that is where
this could lead and that's a slightly more detailed
version of their argument on the merits.  But the point
of the Tax Injunction Act, of course, is that that's a
challenge that has to be brought in State court.  For
example, Quill itself, the case that, kind of, the
merits turn on, was a State court case that proceeded
through, I believe, North Dakota's States.  This Court,
to the extent it believes that's a constitutional
problem that you just identified, would have the right
to -- would -- would have the power to hold it to be an
unconstitutional violation.  In fact, it's worth noting
that the Plaintiffs have availed themselves of Colorado
courts to make just this challenge and already have an
injunction for those, based on --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you know that we accept
minuscule, minuscule percentage of appeals from State
supreme courts.  And as a practical matter, these
challenges in State supreme courts, if they're -- if
they're ruled in a manner that -- that violates Federal
law, they're not going to come up here -- 90 percent of
them aren't going to come up -- more than 90 percent.
So it is important that it begin in Federal court
when -- especially when what is at issue is the selfish
State's assessment and collection of taxes.  I mean,
there is a real incentive on the part of the State
government which includes the State courts to, you know,
to find the tax not paid.
MR. DOMENICO:  Justice Scalia, that's an
argument that Congress has rejected in enacting the Tax
Injunction Act.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, for collection, yes.
MR. DOMENICO:  Assessment and collection of
the tax.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Domenico, you don't
dispute that what Congress had in mind when it passed
the Tax Injunction Act was the proposition that States
that have a system, taxpayer, you pay now, you sue for a
refund later.  It was that scheme that the Tax
Injunction Act was meant to shield so the taxpayer
couldn't say I'd rather pay later.
You pay up front, and then you sue for a
refund.  That's -- that was what was in the front of
Congress's mind.  You don't doubt that, do you?
MR. DOMENICO:  That was the Paradigm case, I
think, is an accurate way to describe that.  That's
most -- going to be the most common form of a case that
would raise these issues.  But what Congress wrote was a
statute that by its terms is broader than that.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Congress wrote a
statute with terms that seem most naturally read to have
a technical meaning, restrain, suspend, enjoin, assess,
levy, and collect.  Those are not -- those are not the
terms that one might use if one were speaking
colloquially.
Let me come back to Justice Kagan's pizza
example.  So her clerks are collecting money for pizza
to be had at night and let's say the Chief Justice says
this is fine, but you -- you may not use court e-mail to
try to collect this.  Now, would you say that the Chief
Justice has restrained, suspended or enjoined the
collection of the pizza money?  You might say he's made
it a little bit harder, maybe he's interfered with it.
But would -- would anybody naturally use those technical
terms.
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, in the pizza context, I
think it would be unlikely to use those technical terms.
But I think in -- in the tax context, if someone told
the Department of Revenue you may not assess or collect
these taxes, I would be very nervous about advising them
nonetheless to proceed with enforcing these laws.
Because by their natural terms the way they're used,
this is part of the assessment process.  This is a means
-- its only purpose as everybody agreed, the district
court, the Plaintiffs, everyone agreed the sole purpose
of this law was to -- to reach the point where we could
assess and collect the taxes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's say we're back
in -- we're in the pre-internet era and I order
something over the phone from an out-of-State vendor.
So this vendor is going to mail it to me across State
lines.  And let's say this particular vendor is somebody
who feels very strongly that everybody ought to pay
taxes that are due.  So this vendor voluntarily, once my
order has been placed, says to me, now, I'm going to
ship this to you in your State and I'm not going to
charge you -- say I'm not going to make you pay sales
tax in my State.  I just want to remind you that you are
obligated under the law of your State to pay use tax.
Would you say that that vendor has assessed the use tax?
MR. DOMENICO:  The vendor has assessed it
simply by informing them that they have to pay the tax?
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
MR. DOMENICO:  I wouldn't say they've
assessed the tax, no.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's -- that's what
you're arguing here, isn't it?
MR. DOMENICO:  I don't think so.
JUSTICE ALITO:  That's exactly what happens.
MR. DOMENICO:  The State's law is the means
by which it can assess the tax.  If it doesn't get that
-- I would say this:  If the vendor said do not pay this
tax, do not tell Colorado, they're the opposite version,
they're someone who objects to the tax, and they said
precisely the opposite, then I would say that they have
interfered with -- they have restrained, suspended the
assessment and collection of that tax.  And that's
what's going on here.
JUSTICE ALITO:  You would say that by saying
that, making that illegal statement, they've enjoined
the -- the payment of the tax?
MR. DOMENICO:  No, I wouldn't say it.  But
I'd say they have restrained --
JUSTICE ALITO:  They have restrained it?
MR. DOMENICO:  Yes.  But individuals don't
have -- obviously, the company doesn't have the power of
an injunction.
said --
for impede?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Restrain means impede?
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, what the Court has
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't restrained a synonym
I -- I thought restrain means to stop.  You
restrain somebody, you prevent that person from doing
what he wants to do.  But you're using it to mean, you
know, whatever impedes the collection of the tax.  It
doesn't make it impossible, it doesn't stop it.  It
just -- it just impedes it.
MR. DOMENICO:  The Court has used the words
interrupt the assessment or collection of the tax to --
the practical effect of suspending it during the
litigation.  I don't think there can be any doubt about
that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, so let's say
the law says not only do you have to notify the people
at the point of sale on the internet, but it must be in
inch-high type so they're sure to see it.  Is that okay?
Because that makes it -- impedes the collection.
Because where, presumably, they can't just put it in the
tiniest little type at the bottom of the page.
MR. DOMENICO:  If the challenge is only to
the size of the font requirement?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I mean, you --
you can make light of it if you like, but they're more
likely to notice it if it's there glaring them in the
face as opposed to a little footnote at the bottom along
with the all the other --
MR. DOMENICO:  Well -- and there are
regulations of that sort with this law and that's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that restrains
the collection of the tax?
MR. DOMENICO:  If you don't -- it restrains
the means of assessment and collection of the tax under
State law.  This Court has referred repeatedly to the
means, the methods, the modes, the system of assessment
and collection dating back before the existence of the
Tax Injunction Act.  The Court referred to the modes, it
was of the utmost importance, the Court said in Dow v.
Chicago that this -- that Federal courts would be
restrained from interfering with the modes of collection
of a tax.  That would restrain the mode under State law,
the method, the means under State law of collecting the
tax.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your argument is at least
intentioned with this Court's decision in Hibbs.  So
what is your best argument for why Hibbs doesn't
control?  Hibbs says this statute is about stopping
taxpayers from avoiding the obligation to paying the
government, and here we have a third party not a
taxpayer.
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I
think what Hibbs was about was that that case did not
interfere with the collection -- the State's revenue
collection mechanisms.  The text of the Act, as this
Court recognized, Justice Alito pointed out, the text of
the Act on this point is identical essentially to the
AIA.  The Court in Americans United flatly rejected the
argument that the AIA only applied to taxpayers and it
would -- it would be contrary to the history of the Act
as well and how this Court has applied it and how the
lower courts have applied it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I'm not quite sure
that you're addressing the essence of Hibbs.  Hibbs
defined the terms "collection," "assessment," et cetera
very narrowly.  Much more narrowly than you are right
now.  The difference that Justice Breyer was pointing to
is the important one.  You haven't answered how you can
get to where you're going unless we disavow the narrow
definitional reading that Hibbs gave to those three
issues.
MR. DOMENICO:  I don't agree with that,
Justice Sotomayor.  The Court can simply recognize that
suspending, restraining, enjoining the methods of
reaching -- getting to the point of being able to plug
in the numbers into the calculation.  The State right
now, when it makes the calculation that is an
assessment, has nothing to put into two of the three
variables.  It can't put in the identity of the taxpayer
and it can't put in whatever the base is to apply to
State tax law.  This law will directly provide that
information.  It's the means of doing an assessment.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's the means of what --
let's posit a State law that requires all taxpayers to
use only a single bank because it will be -- one bank
named by the State because it will be easier to levy
upon all -- upon all accounts.  It makes it a lot easier
for the State.  They just go to that bank and take your
bank account.  Okay?
This is challenged as being a taking, okay,
and the party tries to get into Federal court with that
Federal challenge.  Not possible, right?  Because this
facilitates the collection of the State tax and
therefore to prevent that facilitation is to restrain
the collection of the State tax and therefore the suit
has to be brought in State court; is that right?
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, I think the -- that the
test that's been developed and has proven workable for
decades in the circuit courts, none of them have
rejected, is the question would be is the purpose of
that law, the assessment or collection of taxes --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, it is.  That's the
whole reason --
MR. DOMENICO:  -- and is the likely
effect -- if the whole reason that that law was passed
was to improve the assessment or collection of the tax,
then it would -- then the Tax Injunction Act would allow
that challenge to be brought in State court that the
State courts have proven themselves able to.
I mean, the worst case scenarios under any
of the parade of horribles that the Plaintiffs have --
have brought forward is that the cases go to State
court.  This Court has recognized --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, you're disavowing
then our pointing to in Hibbs the Second Circuit case.
You're saying if the purpose of the law, a law that says
if you don't pay your taxes we're going to imprison you,
that can't be brought to Federal Court, if the purpose
is to ensure that you pay your taxes or to encourage you
to pay your taxes.
MR. DOMENICO:  I think the Court -- I think
the Court, looking at Wells, can make a distinction
based on the fact that in that case the State had given
up on assessing or collecting the taxes.  The facts of
that case were that the State was no longer trying to
assess or collect taxes from Mr. Wells.  It was
instead -- had given up and was punishing him for
failing to comply with the law.
I think the Court can separate penalties
when a case like that comes up --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't want to miss the
question that we started at the beginning of your
brother's argument, which was the consents below issue.
MR. DOMENICO:  Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why was it that until
your briefing here you have been arguing that the TIA
did not apply or were not challenging the analysis by
your adversary?
MR. DOMENICO:  It was just -- it was a
mistake.  Knowing what we know now, we should have
argued it.  That's all I can say.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I guess Federal law is the
same because we have the, what is it, the AIA, the
Anti-Injunction Act.  So if Congress tomorrow passes a
law -- I'm not saying they would -- but that anyone who
hears of anyone paying anyone else any money for any
service or good shall immediately report it to the
nearest -- nearest IRS office, and if they fail to do
so, it's a crime or we'll seize all his assets.
You wouldn't be able to bring that suit for
an injunction in Federal Court on the ground that it's a
bit extreme.  You'd have to wait and pay this whatever
you're supposed -- you're not even supposed to pay, you
just have to do it and then hope somebody challenges it.
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, Justice Breyer, under
the AIA, the challenge provisions are fairly
complicated.  But if a State were to pass that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, I'm not interested
in State now.  I'm just interested in why it might be
that it is wise for Henry Friendly to narrow this word
"collection" because we knew not where we go when, in
fact, it gets too broad.
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, Congress has used the
word "collection" -- "assessment," "levy" and
"collection."  This Court has always interpreted them
very broadly in the context of the Tax Injunction Act,
at least as broadly as in the context of the
Anti-Injunction Act.  And that Congress's determination is
that the collection of taxes is so important that that's
the process that has to be followed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that you
have to distinguish some of the hypotheticals, say, from
Justice Scalia about the computer being used to expedite
tax collection or the bank by saying that what we have
here is an information device that's so closely linked
in the ordinary course to the collection of taxes that
it's collect -- but I -- I --
MR. DOMENICO:  You could certainly --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't know how you would
formulate that test and I'm not quite sure how you'd get
it out of the statute.
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, so the -- the lower
courts again have -- have had more experience with this,
particularly under the AIA.  The D.C. Circuit, for
example, used the word "inextricably linked" to the
assessment and collection process, I think, in the
Seven-Sky decision.  You can certainly adopt some sort
of an attenuation principle where --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But don't you have to do
that in order to distinguish those hypotheticals?
That's my question.
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, certainly yes.  I mean,
in this case though it's very easy.  This is a very
common form of information reporting.  It's simply been
imported from where it's more familiar, the income tax
forum, into this use tax forum.  It's a very common --
they are the party to the transaction.  They typically,
if they are in-State, would actually be collecting the
tax themselves --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Before your time expires,
what's your best formulation of the connection that you
think is required?
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, I think the lower
courts have said two things:  One, the purpose again has
to be assessment and collection.  It can't just be
incidental or a collateral effect.  And the likely
effect has to culminate in assessment or collection.
That's the language most of the circuit courts use,
and -- and --
JUSTICE ALITO:  The likely effect
culminating in collection just seems to me that it
benefits collection in some way.
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, so there is a -- a case
cited, Bell South, that -- that addresses this and says
if the law is something that doesn't interfere between
the relationship between the taxing authority and the
taxed individual or entity, that then the link may have
been broken.  This law clearly -- this injunction
interferes with the relationship between Colorado and
the tax because it prohibits us from getting the
information about who they are and how much they owe.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, it doesn't
prohibit you from doing that at all.
MR. DOMENICO:  It prohibits us from using
the tool provided under State law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, yes, it
prohibits you from doing what you want to do but the
whole question is whether you can do it.  It doesn't
prohibit you -- the relationship between the State and
the taxpayer is between, you know, John Q. Public and
the State.  And John Q. Public owes this money and the
way you get it from him is the same way you get other
taxes that are due from him or you -- you can.  You just
want to have a more efficient way.  But it doesn't
interfere with that relationship.
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, it does -- I would
dispute that it -- that it doesn't interfere with the
relationship.  Certainly if the Court is going to say
that Federal Courts are the proper forum for telling
States which tools or means they can use to assess or
collect the tax, then -- then we shouldn't prevail.  But
if the Tax Injunction Act is about anything, it's about
leaving it out of Federal COURTS --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that -- the
question -- this is just a forum question; right?
MR. DOMENICO:  That's right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You can sue in Federal
court.  The question wouldn't be the one you posed.  The
question would be the one on the merits:  Does this
violate the Commerce Clause?
MR. DOMENICO:  Well, that question, under
the AIA or under the TIA, has to be in State court where
it is right now being litigated by the same parties, the
same claims.  So yes, that question has to be decided in
State court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Isaacson, you have four minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. ISAACSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ISAACSON:  Thank you, Your Honor.
I would like to address three issues that
have been raised by Mr. Domenico.  One of the, I think
primary concerns is the boundless nature of the test
that has been suggested by the executive secretary, and
I believe that it's boundless in two regards:  One, it
could reach any third party.  It can reach common
carriers, it could reach internet service providers, it
could reach credit card companies, it could reach any --
any party that the State maintains has some information
that would be relevant to assist it, to facilitate it in
the collection of -- of taxes.  There is -- there is no
limitation on what that scope may be, even though that
third party itself may not have its tax liability at
issue, nor may it have any interest in any other party's
tax liability.
The -- in addition to that, the definition
of collection as presented by my brother would reach any
activity that might facilitate, not only any person but
any activity that might -- might facilitate.  So there
really is, again, no limitation on what the kind of
request for information might be that could be imposed
by the standard that's been suggested.  The Tax
Injunction Act simply was not intended to provide for
that kind of expansive, unbounded reach.
Much to the contrary, as Justice Ginsburg
has pointed out, the purpose was to require taxpayers
who want to challenge their tax assessments to have to
go through State procedures that have been established,
which usually were the payment of the tax and bringing a
suit for refund, and not to employ Federal court equity
jurisdiction.
The -- the difference between the original
purpose of the Tax Injunction Act and its proposed use
by the State of Colorado is immense.
Second, Mr. Domenico said that he believed
that absent this information, it effectively would make
it impossible for the State of Colorado to be able to
pursue use tax collection.
But I believe it's interesting to note that
the State of Colorado has not employed many of the
measures that other States have employed to collect use
taxes.  So, for example, most States have a line on
their income tax return that allows for the voluntary
reporting of -- of State taxes, or you can have
electronic reporting of State taxes which, in Colorado,
80 percent of Colorado taxpayers use electronic
reporting in which you can have a screen that requires
that there be reporting of the tax before the screen
proceeds to the next -- to the next entry line.
The State of Colorado is the only State in
the country that is not participating in the streamlined
sales tax project that is intended to simplify sales tax
reporting and collection, so that these alternative
measures certainly are available, have not been tried by
Colorado, but instead what Colorado has selected --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How successful are any of
those methods?  You can have as much notice as you want
to the taxpayer, but most people are not going to pay
the use tax if they don't think the government could
find out that they bought something in another State.
MR. ISAACSON:  In regard to what the State
of Colorado does with its own taxpayers, its own
residents, it's free to do so.  For example, there have
been other States that have employed a default
percentage, that the default percentage applies unless
there's affirmative reporting of an -- of an alternative
number.  My home State of Maine previously had that --
that arrangement.
So that it is not as if the State is bereft
of any opportunity to enhance it.  The -- the use of the
term "impossible" by Mr. Domenico, I think, is -- is
really a -- a gross overstatement.
I also want to point out that many of the
cases that have been cited by Mr. Domenico are
Anti-Injunction Act cases, Federal -- Federal cases.
For example, the case law that relates to anything that
is intended to culminate in collection.  The language of
the Anti-Injunction Act and the Tax Injunction Act is
not the same.  The language of the Anti-Injunction Act
refers to for the purpose of restraining and is not the
same as enjoined, suspend or restrained.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I just ask you to
clarify your position on the State's alleged consent to
this suit?  Is it your argument that the Tax Injunction
Act allows a Federal court to consider -- to entertain a
case that would be otherwise barred by that Act if the
State consents?  If that's your position, do you have
authority for it and have you raised this argument in
your -- in your petition and in your brief?
MR. ISAACSON:  I believe we have.  The --
the -- for example, if the State brings a collection
action in -- in Federal court, those cases have been --
have been allowed to continue in Federal court even
though it's an act of collection.  Citation for that
case is Jefferson v. Acre.  Jefferson County v. Acre.
I think it is most telling, though, Justice
Alito, in regard to the comity issue.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the
