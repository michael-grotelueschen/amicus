CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear
argument first this morning in Case 08-1371, Christian
Legal Society Chapter of the University of California-
Hastings v. Martinez.
Mr. McConnell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McCONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
If Hastings is correct, a student who does
not even believe in the Bible is entitled to demand to
lead a Christian Bible study, and if CLS does not
promise to allow this, the college will bar them from its
forum for speech.
The First Amendment -- under the First
Amendment, rights run the opposite way. Hastings is the
government; CLS is private. A public forum for speech
must be open and inclusive, but participants in the
forum are entitled to their own voice.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, these are fundamental
arguments, and I don't want to spend too much time on
factual matters because that's frustrating to both the
Court and the counsel.
But we do have the problem of the
stipulation. The stipulation makes it clear that
Democrats and Republicans can both get into the other
one's club. That's the Stipulations 17 and 18 at 220 of the
Joint Appendix. You want to get away from the
stipulation by what, according to your reply brief,
Hastings said in its answer, but the stipulation
supersedes the answer.
So if both counsel could just address for a
moment: What is the case that we have here? You have
different views on what case is before us.
MR. McCONNELL: Happy to, Justice Kennedy.
If you just look with me at Joint
Stipulation 17, I think it makes this completely clear.
That's on page 221 of the Joint Appendix, and it states:
"Both parties agreed that in order to become a
registered student organization a student organization's
bylaws must provide that its membership is open to all
students" -- that's the all-comers policy -- "and the
organization must agree to abide by" -- "abide by the
Nondiscrimination Policy." That's capital N, capital P,
a defined term. The "Nondiscrimination Policy" is
defined in Joint Stipulation Number 15. That is what we
have been calling the written policy. And the idea that
membership must be open to all students is described in
Joint Stipulation 18, which is simply a description of
what that policy is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But doesn't -- doesn't the
one -- isn't the all-comers policy broader than the
nondiscrimination policy, so that if you comply with
that you automatically comply with everything in the
nondiscrimination clause?
MR. McCONNELL: It is broader. It's our
position that either of these justifications for
excluding CLS is unconstitutional.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but the latter,
the nondiscrimination policy, you assert is -- is not
viewpoint neutral, that it has a particular impact upon
a religious organization; whereas, the other policy, the
all-comers policy, applies to everybody, and that
argument is not available to you.
MR. McCONNELL: Justice Scalia, our
argument -- there are two policies. They have invoked
both. We believe both are unconstitutional, but for
slightly different reasons. The written policy is
unconstitutional because it’s overtly viewpoint
discrimination -- discriminatory and thus violating
the principles of cases like Rosenberger and Widmar.
The all-comers --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. McConnell,
Justice Scalia had just made the point that the all-comers
policy overwhelms the other, so that I would like you to
deal up front with the all-comers policy that the dean
in her deposition said, loud and clear: "Our policy is
all-comers. Yes, Republicans have to be admitted to the
Democratic group and vice versa." So unless you are
challenging the veracity of the dean after stipulating,
as you did, that all-comers is the policy, I don't see
how we can listen to your argument about the so-called
written policy.
MR. McCONNELL: Well, both policies we contend
are unconstitutional. Let's begin with the all-comers
policy, and when you conclude that it is
unconstitutional, we will also need to deal with the
other since they have two arrows in their quiver.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can do that, but you --
it's a much different case if Hastings treats the CLS
differently than it treats the Democratic and Republican
Clubs. That’s a much different -- frankly, it's a much
easier case for you. But it's -- it's frustrating for
us not to know what kind of case we have in front of us.
MR. McCONNELL: Your Honor, it's a case
where the -- where Hastings has put forward two quite
different justifications for denying our right and both
of them are unconstitutional.
Let's begin with the all-comers policy.
JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. McConnell, when I
read -- when I read the papers that Hastings submitted
to the district court at the same time that the joint
stipulation was submitted, I saw one reference after
another to an allegation that Hastings was applying its
policy in a discriminatory manner, that it was not in
fact insisting that all registered student organizations
admit all applicants. And when I read their brief in
the Ninth Circuit, I saw that point reiterated again and
again.
So that led me to believe that what was
stipulated was not that in fact they had a policy which
they enforced under which anybody who applied to any
group would be admitted, but that this was what Dean
Kane had announced. That was the stated policy, but not
necessarily the actual policy that was employed. And
that was the argument it seemed to me that CLS was
making; isn't that correct?
MR. McCONNELL: That's entirely correct,
Justice -- Justice Alito. That’s --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you should -- if that
was it you should have brought in some -- some evidence
of different treatment of other groups. And there --
as I --
MR. McCONNELL: Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: There is none of that
except your citation of the bylaws of two groups in your
brief, as I --
MR. McCONNELL: Well, but that is in fact the
evidence. When --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. McConnell, here
is a statement, a stipulation. It's a stipulation for
summary judgment. It says: District Judge, you take
this to be the fact: Hastings requires that registered
student organizations allow any student to participate,
become a member, seek leadership positions in the
organization. That is not qualified. It says:
District Judge, here are the facts that we stipulate.
It doesn't say this is what the dean says, but it's not
really enforced. It's not qualified at all.
MR. McCONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, we -- we
stipulated that this was their policy. That stipulation
contains nothing about the historical facts as to how
Hastings has actually applied it. But let's talk about
the policy, because it is unconstitutional --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you would. You are
going to waste your whole time just discussing this
stipulation point. Let's assume -- let's assume that --
MR. McCONNELL: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the latter is the policy.
MR. McCONNELL: Yes, because the policy is I
think blatantly unconstitutional. It is manifestly
overbroad with respect to any purposes stated. And, of
course, in Healy v. James, this Court held that any
restriction on a student speech forum may be no more
extensive than is required by its purposes. It is also
a frontal assault on freedom of association. Freedom of
association is the right to form around shared beliefs.
To say that groups may not form around shared beliefs --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is this an exception
that you want to talk about as it is applied to
religious groups, or are you suggesting that if a group
wanted to exclude all black people, all women, all
handicapped persons, whatever other form of
discrimination a group wants to practice, that a school
has to accept that group and recognize it, give it funds,
and otherwise lend it space?
MR. McCONNELL: Not at all, Justice
Sotomayor. Our position is that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So then, what is --
what is wrong with the purpose of a school to say we don't
wish any group that doesn't -- that discriminates?
MR. McCONNELL: The stipulation is that they
may not exclude based on status or beliefs. We have
only challenged the beliefs, not status. Race, any
other status basis Hastings is able to enforce. But
they may not tell a group --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So, what if the belief --
MR. McCONNELL: -- that you just have to let
you in that don't agree with you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the belief is that
African Americans are inferior?
MR. McCONNELL: Again, I think they can
discriminate on the basis of the belief, but not on
the basis of the status. So that if the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You could have --
MR. McCONNELL: -- if there were racist
organizations --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a student
organization, I suppose, of that type. It wouldn't
include many people. But if there were such an
organization, I assume that they would have that -- that
belief required, right?
MR. McCONNELL: That's right, but they could
not go the next step and exclude someone on the basis of
status, under our --
JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn’t this say the
opposite? It says we are -- you have to let anybody in --
anybody -- regardless of their status or beliefs. So you can't
discriminate on the basis of status or belief. That's
what the policy says I just read. It doesn't say you
can; it says you can't.
MR. McCONNELL: It's that the group may not
confine its leadership based upon its beliefs. That means
that --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what you say, but
that's not what the policy says. The policy says that
you have to let everybody in, regardless of their status
or belief.
MR. McCONNELL: Right. And -- and our view is
that the status --
JUSTICE BREYER: So you cannot discriminate on
the basis of status or belief.
MR. McCONNELL: The status half of that is
perfectly constitutional and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You say you --
MR. McCONNELL: -- the belief half of that is not.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- you have to -- you
have to let these organizations discriminate on the
basis of belief. And they say: No, we don't want to;
that's too complicated for us to figure out which ones
we should, which ones we shouldn't. We'd rather let them
work off-campus. We just don't want to get into this
business. It's not just against religion. It might be
against a Turkish-speaking society that thinks Turkish
is extremely important to speak or a chess club that
thinks the same. It could be a lot of people.
Now, why do you -- what's wrong with us, a First
Amendment -- an organization itself affected with First
Amendment interests, saying we just don't want to have
those on campus organizations, too much trouble.
MR. McCONNELL: What is -- what is wrong with
that is that restrictions on a designated public forum must
be reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum. The
purpose of the forum is set forth in Joint Stipulation
Number 8. It is to promote a diversity of viewpoints
among registered student organizations. If the student
organizations are not allowed to have a coherent set of
beliefs, there can be no diversity among them.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this sounds like a
debate over whether the policy as the school believes it
should be implemented is not a good one. But isn't that
their choice? Don't we give deference to an educational
institution in terms of the choices it makes about
effecting its own -- its purposes? And the purpose here
is we don't want our students to discriminate.
MR. McCONNELL: There is a stipulation as to
what the purpose is, and the purpose is to promote a
diversity of viewpoints among registered student
organizations.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's their way of doing
that.
MR. McCONNELL: It is a stipulated fact.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Hastings takes the
position that it's all in favor of diversity, not only
among the groups but within the groups. So --
MR. McCONNELL: Which is not the joint
stipulation. The stipulation is that the purpose of the
forum is diversity among groups. Their policy is not --
it's not only just unreasonable in light of it; it is
contrary to it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It is that they --
MR. McCONNELL: It defeats the purpose of the forum.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They say, yes, we believe in
diversity among groups, but we also believe in diversity
within the group; that's a good thing. They are not backing
off from: We think diversity among groups is fine.
MR. McCONNELL: They say that in their
brief, but that is not the stipulated fact in the
case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Let me make an imaginary
example, and that’s --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is the
stipulation?
MR. McCONNELL: It's page 216 in the Joint
Appendix, Joint Stipulation Number 8. It is the only
stipulation in the case having to do with what the
purpose is of the RSO forum.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute now. A
diversity --
MR. McCONNELL: "Hastings seeks to promote a
diversity of viewpoints among registered student
organizations."
And note how destructive an all-comers
policy directed on belief is toward -- toward that.
That means that if, for example, there’s an NAACP
chapter, it would have to allow a -- a racist skinhead
to sit on -- in on its planning meetings. That means
that if there’s an environmentalist club that has a
demonstration in Sacramento in favor of cap-and-trade
legislation, they would have to allow --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be --
MR. McCONNELL: -- a global warming skeptic
to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be an ill-advised
policy, but the school says: It's our policy. It's
working fine, and all the -- the hypotheticals about
sabotage, takeover, they haven't happened.
MR. McCONNELL: They haven't happened
because this policy came into being -- was announced for
the first time in 2005. So there couldn't possibly be
any -- any record of that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this was not the
policy on the basis of which CLS was excluded; is that
correct?
MR. McCONNELL: That's correct, it was not.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- when they were
refused participation in the -- in the student
organization program, they were not told about the
all-comers policy.
MR. McCONNELL: That's correct. Joint
Stipulation Number 40 states clearly that the -- that the
-- that they were informed, and I quote: "They were
informed that CLS bylaws were not compliant with the
religion and sexual orientation provisions of the
Nondiscrimination Policy."
JUSTICE ALITO: And was there any written
document memorializing this policy prior to the time
when the former dean gave her deposition?
MR. McCONNELL: Never. And --
JUSTICE ALITO: And is the -- is the policy
as articulated by the dean in her deposition the same as
the policy that Hastings now claims it has in its brief?
MR. McCONNELL: I don't think so. Every
time the policy is mentioned, it seems to morph into
something else. When the dean announced it at the
deposition, she said all students may participate on
the -- in all activities, period, full stop. Now we
find out in their brief, well, their -- groups can have
conduct limitations, they can require dues, they can
have attendance requirements, they can have competitive
contests to see whether they get in.
This -- this policy is -- it changes with
every wind.
And -- but the fundamental problem with
this -- with this is what -- what this Court stated in
Velazquez v. Legal Services Corporation, that you cannot
allow -- you cannot allow the terms of the policy just
to say that whatever their policy is, that that
determines the contours of the program, because that
would render the First Amendment a -- a nullity.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that was not a
religion case. Your argument at its most fundamental
level is that religious organizations are different
because religion is all about belief. But at that point
don't we also have a tradition of separation? That's
the whole reason why church and state for many purposes
are kept separate, so that States are not implicated
with religious beliefs.
And it -- it -- it seems to me we have to
consider that when we are considering your argument.
Now, you can cite Rosenberger, but -- but I think this is
different from that.
MR. McCONNELL: The separation is between
church and state, but this Court has held over and over
again that speech forums -- that people participating in
a speech forum are not the state. The state is
Hastings. We are perfectly private. There is nothing
wrong with a religious organization, even on public --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You’re not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Anyway, as I understand
your argument on the all-comers policy, it is not an
argument that -- that is based upon the religious nature
of CLS. You would make the same argument of
unconstitutionality with respect to the student
Republican Club, wouldn't you?
MR. McCONNELL: We would.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Or --
MR. McCONNELL: Now, we do --
there is in addition a free exercise argument, but I
don't -- but in this case what the Free Exercise Clause
protects is exactly what the associational freedom test
would protect for everyone.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought that an
important part of the case, of your case, is that belief
is inherent to the idea of religious expression and must
be protected. But if the protection causes problems
within the school for other policies, then doesn't the
separation policy come into play? That's -- that's what
I'm asking.
MR. McCONNELL: Again, separation does not
apply to private parties when they are operating, even
on government property.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell, let's say
it is the belief of this group, based on their reading
of the Bible, that only white men can lead the Bible
studies, can become officers of the group, and that's
based on their fundamental belief that that's what the
Bible instructs. On your view, must Hastings give this
organization status as a recognized student
organization?
MR. McCONNELL: No, Justice Ginsburg. Our
position is it is unconstitutional to -- to prohibit
groups to form around beliefs but not around status.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the belief is -- this
is the belief.
MR. McCONNELL: They can insist that -- that
everyone who participates in the group have that belief,
and that, as Justice Scalia said, may mean it's going to
be a very small group. But they cannot discriminate on
the basis of status. But belief -- as this Court said
in Cantwell v. Connecticut, belief, the freedom to
believe, is absolute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, they -- they would have
to negate their belief in their practice. They could
believe this, but they couldn't implement it?
MR. McCONNELL: Well, it's not unusual to
say people -- people can believe in all kinds of things
that are illegal. That doesn't mean that they can do
them. It's not a -- it's not an unfamiliar distinction
in our law. But let's look at --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This was the basis -- your
distinction between status and belief was the basis for
your saying that the original policy, whatever --
whatever we call it -- what is the name of it?
MR. McCONNELL: The written policy?
JUSTICE SCALIA: The written policy -- when
it forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation was complied with by CLS because it would
not discriminate on the basis of orientation, only on
the basis of belief.
MR. McCONNELL: That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: If -- if a homosexual
person said, I want to belong to this club, and I
believe in its principles, I don't believe in sexual
relationships before marriage, and that's why I want to
work for homosexual marriage, which I do, so my
consistency there, is that person -- I am consistent in
what I work for, what I believe, and on -- as far as
premarital sex is concerned, it's totally 100 percent
with your organization that you are representing; would
they admit that person or not?
MR. McCONNELL: Yes. There’s a joint
stipulation to that effect, Number 34.
JUSTICE SCALIA: CLS doesn't have any -- any
belief that marriage is between a man and a woman?
MR. McCONNELL: It -- it does. I thought
that Justice Breyer posited the case of a person of
homosexual orientation who shares that belief.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, no.
JUSTICE BREYER: He shares the belief that
there should be no premarital sex --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But he wants to marry --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and he says that's why I
am working for Proposition 8 or whatever the
proposition, or against it --
MR. McCONNELL: Oh, oh, I'm sorry,
Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm working to legalize
homosexual marriage in which --
MR. McCONNELL: I'm sorry. I misunderstood
your question. This is a religious group. Their
understanding of marriage is based upon their --
JUSTICE BREYER: So they would not -- the
answer is no, that person --
MR. McCONNELL: Not if that person was
engaging in sexual conduct that is contrary to the --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, he's not --
MR. McCONNELL: Well, in that --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- because his
sexual conduct --
MR. McCONNELL: -- or -- I'm sorry. Or --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- he will refrain until
marriage is made lawful --
MR. McCONNELL: Right.
JUSTCIE BREYER: -- at which point he intends
to engage in sexual conduct.
MR. McCONNELL: That's right. If the
person --
JUSTICE BREYER: That person.
MR. McCONNELL: Regardless of what he
intends to do, if he does not agree with the -- the
organization on the point of -- of marriage, then he can
be -- he can be excluded from leadership in the group.
Again, he's able to attend all the
activities. CLS has all of its activities entirely open
to everyone. And what it objects to is having -- is
being run by non-Christians, because after all, this is
a group whose very purpose is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep talking about
being forced to let people in. And this is where I'm a
little bit confused by your yellow brief.
The school has taken the position that any
group can apply to use its facilities; priority and
funding, et cetera, will only go to recognized student
groups. But your group is not being excluded or
ostracized completely from the school. Presumably, you
can meet in the cafeteria. You can meet in open spaces
in the school. You can apply like everyone else, any
other nonstudent group, recognized student group. But
you have been saying repeatedly in your presentation
that you're barred from the campus. And so I'm a little
confused as to exactly --
MR. McCONNELL: What I -- Justice Sotomayor,
I believe what we consistently say is that we have been
denied the right to meet on campus. And that is
completely true. Look -- if you would look at Joint
Stipulation Number 10, at the top of page 219, it provides
that CLS, although not currently registered, is eligible
to apply for permission for rooms. But there is no
stipulation that that will ever be granted, and the
record shows that every time CLS has requested
permission to meet they have gotten a complete
run-around. They have been told: Well, you have to
apply through your lawyer, and then their -- they don't
get an answer on time and when they get an answer it's,
well, because you’re not a registered student group --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's -- could we --
MR. McCONNELL: -- there is not room for
you.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's -- let's assume,
because I'm not quite sure what the record is on these
issues -- I'm somewhat confused on the factual assumptions
underlying this case. But let's assume two things: One,
that in fact you have the option of applying for use of
the space and that, assuming there are no conflicts and
other things that -- that are in the normal course would
preclude your use, that you would be granted use. Is your
argument different in that situation?
MR. McCONNELL: Justice Sotomayor, even the
access to campus communications is absolutely essential,
as this Court said in the -- in Healy v. James. We are
barred from access to the -- to Hastings' e-mail system;
we can't post notices on the usual bulletin board; we
are left out of the weekly --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There are bulletin
boards. There are other ones.
MR. McCONNELL: There -- there’s -- there
are ones for the -- for campus and student groups, and
there’s another one for community groups. We’re
allowed to post on the community group, but we’re not
allowed to post on the boards that -- that students look
to for where student activities occur.
We are left out of the -- a very important
point -- the student organization fair at the beginning
of the year where groups introduce themselves to the
One L's as they -- as they come in.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you disputing that
this is --
MR. McCONNELL: We're -- we're barred from
that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you disputing this
is a limited forum, public forum?
MR. McCONNELL: No, it's definitely a
limited designated public forum.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's different from
Cantwell. Cantwell is where the Jehovah's Witness
plays the record on the -- on the street. And -- and --
MR. McCONNELL: I only cite Cantwell for the
proposition that belief is absolute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. And Cantwell
said that belief is central to -- to religions and that
people would disagree. But that's precisely why
Hastings might argue to us that -- that this is
inconsistent with their idea of what this forum is. And
if -- will you just address that, please?
MR. McCONNELL: I would address it. The
forum -- the purposes of the forum are undisputed. They
are to provide a diversity of expression among student
groups. Their policy disserves the purpose of the forum
and therefore cannot be regarded as reasonable in light
of that. And what is more, what they have done is --
it's also not reasonable because it's independently
unconstitutional. What they have done is they've said
you may not have fundamental freedom of association or,
if you do, we will withdraw an otherwise available
benefit from you.
As recently as the unanimous decision of
this Court in FAIR v. Rumsfeld, the Court reiterated the
-- the now I think 100-year old principle that
constitutional rights may not be penalized by the
withdrawal of benefits any more than they can by -- by
direct prohibition.
I see that my white light is up, and I’d
like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
McConnell.
Mr. Garre.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
This case was decided by both courts below
on the premise, which is not disputed at any point in the
petition for certiorari, that Hastings reserves the
funding and benefits that go to student groups that
obtain school recognition to groups that choose to admit
all students
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why do
you have --
MR. GARRE: -- regardless of their status or
their beliefs.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you have a policy,
a written policy -- you don't have a written policy that says
anything about all-comers. You’ve got a written
policy that says you can -- you can't discriminate on
the basis of only one type of belief, religious belief.
MR. GARRE: Mr. Chief Justice, first of all,
this is a case about injunctive relief. As a matter of
law, the only policy that’s relevant is the current
policy, and that's the one --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why is --
MR. GARRE: -- that both sides agree is
in place.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this
nondiscrimination policy no longer on the books?
MR. GARRE: No. It’s -- it's the way in which
Hastings implements the nondiscrimination policy in this
particular forum. And, again, look at the Ninth Circuit
decision in this case. It’s --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That is not an
implementation of the nondiscrimination policy. I mean,
the two policies are quite different. Now, are you
telling us that the written policy is no longer
operative?
MR. GARRE: No, it -- Justice Scalia, this
is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, what? No, it's not
operative or no, you’re not telling me that?
(Laughter.)
MR. GARRE: It is operative. This -- the
all-comers policy is how it's implemented in this
context. And the written policy applies not only to the
enumerated characteristics; it applies to any arbitrary
unreasonable discrimination, and the law school --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it doesn't --
it doesn't say that.
MR. GARRE: It does, Your Honor. It says in
the first paragraph on -- this is on page 220 --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
MR. GARRE: -- of the Joint Appendix: The
college is committed to a policy against legally
impermissible, arbitrary, or unreasonable discriminatory
practices. And then it also goes on and enumerates
specific factors. And this is spelled out, I believe in
page --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they -- so you’re
saying the second paragraph is totally
unnecessary. You say the first paragraph says you can't
discriminate on any basis, and the second paragraph
spells out the bases. So why do you do have the second
paragraph?
MR. GARRE: I think it provides additional
guidance. But -- but, again, there shouldn't be any
debate about what policy is at issue here. The Ninth
Circuit's decision in this case is two-sentence long.
The first sentence describes the policy at issue in this
case. And it says: "The parties stipulate" --
JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think this case
deserved a two-sentence decision in the Ninth Circuit?
MR. GARRE: Justice Alito, it was decided in
the wake of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Truth, which
had not only garnered a substantial panel decision but
had garnered serious consideration on -- on rehearing.
So this case, the Ninth Circuit properly concluded, was
controlled by the Truth decision. So in that respect --
JUSTICE ALITO: So the answer is yes, this case
which is -- before us has produced hundreds and hundreds of
pages of amicus briefs, deserved two sentences in the
court of appeals?
MR. GARRE: In the -- in the sense that it
was backed up by the Truth decision, yes. But look at
the petition for certiorari in this case. Nowhere did
-- did Petitioners challenge the Ninth Circuit's
characterization of the policy at issue. The petition
says on page 2 that "There are no disputed issues of
material fact."
JUSTICE ALITO: But hasn't it been -- hasn't
it been CLS's position from the very beginning of this
case that Hastings has not in fact required every group
to admit any student who applies? Don't they say that
over and over again in their district court papers, in
the court of appeals briefs, and in the cert petition?
MR. GARRE: If -- if they believe that that
caused the school to adopt a different policy, they
shouldn't have stipulated to the policy that they did.
And they should have challenged at a minimum --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they stipulated that
the policy exists. They didn't stipulate that it is --
is being faithfully applied by Hastings. What do you do
about the -- the -- the two organizations' bylaws
referred to in the -- in the Petitioner's brief, which
clearly do -- conflict with the so-called all-comers
policy?
MR. GARRE: All of the bylaws that they've
pointed to, Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA: All of the bylaws --
MR. GARRE: -- that they have pointed to in
their brief --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MR. GARRE: -- Justice Scalia, either,
number one, explicitly say that the organization will
comply with the rules and regulations of the school or
say that they will admit all students. That includes
all the bylaws.
Now, they have pointed to various things
from the bylaws, and this evolved as they’ve tried to
create material factual issues in this Court. One of
the things they've pointed to is the bylaws saying, like
the Outlaw bylaw, that says that students who are
members of a group can be excelled if they -- expelled
if they engage in disruptive or gross misconduct. There
is nothing inconsistent about that with the school's
policy. The school's interest is not in allowing
students to disrupt the activities of students'
groups --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they -- they
quite -- quote the bylaws of the National Lawyers Guild,
which says any member must “agree with the objectives
of the organization as set forth herein.” That's not
all-comers. That's a bylaw that restricts an
organization according to its -- members can't join
unless they sign on the dotted line that they believe in
objectives of the organization.
MR. GARRE: There’s a fundamental
difference between a group that says people of a
particular sexual orientation are not allowed to become
members --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they don’t say that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It has nothing to
do with --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't say that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's got nothing to
do with sexual -- well, I don't know the National
Lawyers Guild, but they say you have got to agree with
the objectives of the organization.
MR. GARRE: Justice Scalia, the district
court made a -- may I?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, start with mine.
MR. GARRE: Okay. My apologies.
(Laughter.)
MR. GARRE: Mr. Chief Justice, as -- as
Dean -- as director of student services testified, the
fact that the bylaws may say we want students who are
interested in our activities doesn't mean that the
bylaws are excluding students who want to join. And
there’s a fundamental difference, again, between saying
students that have these particular beliefs or status
cannot become members of our group --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that
your position is continually evolving wherever the First
Amendment pressure comes. You’ve got a written
nondiscrimination policy. And then you say, well, yes,
but we use an all-comers policy. You’ve got an
all-comers policy, and then groups don't actually follow
the all-comers policy, and you have another answer to
that. It seems to me that we should go with -- why
shouldn't we go with the written policy and the written
bylaws?
MR. GARRE: Well, with respect, Your Honor,
I think it's my friend's position that is evolving. You
have joint stipulations before you as to what the policy
is. You have the decisions of both courts below
describing that policy consistently with the joint
stipulations, and you have a petition for certiorari
that never challenges that the all-comers policy is at
issue.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do we do with the
selective application argument, which is what
Justice Alito referred to and Justice Scalia, which is
it is troubling that some of these bylaws do limit their
groups? La Raza limited it to people of Hispanic
descent, and the Lawyers Guild to people who adopt its
-- its beliefs. What are we going to do with this
selective application argument?
MR. GARRE: This case wasn’t --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's in the case, isn't
it? And if it is, what does it do to your policy?
MR. GARRE: Justice Sotomayor, this case
wasn't litigated as a pretext case. If you look at the
briefs in this case, the first time that the word
"pretext" is used is in the reply brief in this Court.
It was litigated as a challenge, which is a serious
challenge, to the constitutionality of an all-comers
policy in this particular forum.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the two are connected,
though, Mr. Garre. Frankly, one reason why I am
inclined to think this is pretextual is that it is so
weird to require the -- the campus Republican Club to
admit Democrats, not just to membership, but to
officership. To require this Christian society to allow
atheists not just to join, but to conduct Bible classes,
right? That's crazy.
(Laughter.)
MR. GARRE: But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And is there any other
university in the country that has this kind of a
policy?
MR. GARRE: There absolutely is, Justice
Scalia, and it's explained --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that?
MR. GARRE: It's explained
in the amicus brief for the American Council of
Education, explained in the State Universities amicus
brief.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there are very few
universities. But why doesn't this just all work out?
If the Christian Legal Society has these beliefs, I am
not so sure why people that don't agree with them want
to belong to them. What -- doesn't this all just work
out?
MR. GARRE: Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And doesn't it work out that
the Democrats -- they don't want to go in the Republican
club and run for officership anyway.
MR. GARRE: Hastings --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So why -- what’s --
what interest does this -- does the school have in this
policing mechanism that it's imposing?
MR. GARRE: A few -- a number of things,
Justice Kennedy. The first is the line-drawing issue
that has been made clear during the first part of the
argument this morning. If you're going -- they appear
to take off the table race and what they say are other
status considerations. I'm not sure why that excludes
sexual orientation.
But if you’re going to allow religious
groups, or any group, to draw exceptions for some
people, then you have to determine where to draw the
line. And I think a school can reasonably say: We
don't want to get into this business at all; we want to
allow all comers
JUSTICE ALITO: But you now say --
MR. GARRE: -- for all school-subsidized groups.
JUSTICE ALITO: You now say in your brief that
it is okay for a group to impose membership requirements
that are neutral and not based on beliefs. Isn't that right?
MR. GARRE: That doesn't go to status or
belief. If you’re talking about attendance
requirements or competition --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you’re talking
about --
MR. GARRE: -- those are merits-based
requirements.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- La Raza background.
As I understand it, the La Raza organization says you have
to be of La Raza background to be a policy member of the
organization.
MR. GARRE: The La Raza bylaws -- first of
all, they did explicitly say that groups could not
exclude members on the basis of sexual orientation.
Now, they -- there was some confusion about
how La Raza had interpreted their bylaws. The school
went back to La Raza and said: Are you excluding
members? La Raza said: No, we’re not; we’re open to
all. And to eliminate any doubt, they amended their
bylaws. That's the one example they've come up in the
-year history of this policy. And what does it show?
If you want to look at --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, wait, wait. Twenty
years? Do you have any evidence that this policy, the
one we’re arguing about now, that is to say, the
all-comers policy, existed before CLS brought this
litigation? As I recall, the only evidence in the
record is a letter from the dean describing this policy
after the litigation began.
MR. GARRE: Justice Scalia, it's based on
the sworn deposition testimony on the former dean, who
had been at the school since 1993, the director of
student services, who had been there at least since
99, as this is how they had implemented the
nondiscrimination policy. I don't think there’s any
basis for this Court to overturn that sworn testimony.
JUSTICE BREYER: What we have is a rule, a
stipulation. And as I read it, to try to make sense out
of it, it does seem to discriminate against
organizations in respect to which intellectual purity
would be important. They’re going to have a harder
time. The ones that don't care that much will have an
easier time.
Now, in trying to judge the
constitutionality of that, I first have no idea which
these organizations are. We've got one of them, but
there may be a lot of others. I don't know if the
Democratic Club is or is not. I don't know how big the
tent they want. I don't know whether the Turkish
Society even exists. I don't know how the chess club
feels about players of tiddlywinks.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: So I have an absolute void
in this record, which in turn I think would be important
to fill that void, because their justification --
MR. GARRE: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- is they don't want to get
into this, it's too complicated, and we’re not
doing that much harm to them because they can meet
off-campus, and it's a big, disruptive influence, all of
these things.
And then sneaking in here is this anti-gay
bias issue, and -- and they want to say: That isn't
much, because that isn't really the point here, and
that's what we think, anyway. It's just an example of
something.
So with that great unclarity, asked to
decide a constitutional issue where I feel I’d need more
facts and I don't have them --
MR. GARRE: Well, you --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- the more justification to
know what it really is, which I don't have, what should
I do?
MR. GARRE: If the Court believes that,
respectfully, we think it should dismiss the writ as
improvidently granted. This case was litigated based on
stipulations to avoid precisely these factual issues
that we’re now talking about for the first time before
this Court.
Now, I think it is common ground that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- Mr. Garre, you
did say that the evidence is the dean's deposition.
There’s no prior evidence. But there are schools,
including law schools, that have this policy. Is that
not so?
MR. GARRE: That's true. Georgetown Law
School does. Columbia Law School. Look, there’s an
amicus brief filed by 13 educational organizations
representing thousands of colleges and universities
across the country, including the Association of Jesuit
Colleges and Universities, saying that this is a
not-uncommon and a reasonable policy. We’re not saying
it's the only approach that colleges can take in
balancing the competing interests here.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let’s explore --
MR. GARRE: We’re saying it’s a
constitutional --
JUSTICE ALITO: Let's explore the
implications of this policy. Suppose at a particular
campus there is a great deal of anti-Muslim animus.
And there’s a small Muslim group; it has 10 students.
If the group is required to accept anybody who applies
for membership, and 50 students who hate Muslims show up
and they want to take over that group, you say the First
Amendment allows that?
MR. GARRE: Justice Alito, that’s the
claim, obviously, that the other side is making. And,
with respect, this example has never happened at
Hastings in 20 years. It has really never happened in
the history of American education. If you look at cases
like the voter I.D. case, the partial-birth abortion
case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have a law
that says every newspaper that’s published in the
United States must be reviewed every day by the
government's censor board, and the fact that the
government's censor board decides not to do it, then
that law is okay?
MR. GARRE: I think this Court would
ordinarily take into account the likelihood that
something would happen, and if you're dealing where the
only experience --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A newspaper sues
saying that law is constitutional, and we’ll say it's
all right; it has never been applied?
MR. GARRE: Of course this Court is going to
examine the chill, but so -- just like in the voter I.D. case,
where you had had people saying this was going to and,
on secondhand accounts, did exclude people from getting
to the -- ballot access. This Court said, look, that might
happen, but it's not a basis to invalidate this law
across the board. Come back with an as-applied challenge.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was because
they might adopt a different policy. We’re not dealing
with a future different policy in this case.
MR. GARRE: And there's -- as to the
takeover hypothetical, there is no evidence that it has
happened. Groups can take measures to prevent it. They
can require attendance requirements before people become
members. They can instruct into their bylaws --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not going to
help if you have the 50 anti-Muslim students who want to
take over the group.
MR. GARRE: People have to be -- attend a
certain number of meetings before they can join. They can
have --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. They take
over the group and the first thing they do is say we’re
abolishing the attendance policy.
(Laughter.)
MR. GARRE: They can have in their -- they
can -- sure. I mean, we can entertain the
hypotheticals. But they can have in their bylaws a
provision just like the Constitution of the United
States, that amendments can only be made by a
super-majority --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, CLS obviously thinks
this is a real threat. Now, what do you propose that
they do? Suppose that you win this case, and then when
the case -- and then when this all-applicants policy is
administered, then precisely what they fear begins to
take place. Do they have any recourse?
MR. GARRE: I think if that started to take
place, the college would reconsider its policy. It
could bring a First Amendment challenge saying that --
JUSTICE ALITO: No, do they have any --
MR. GARRE: -- that would --
JUSTICE ALITO: Do they have any recourse?
MR. GARRE: I think at that point --
JUSTICE ALITO: If they have 10 members,
and 8 who are completely hostile to the organization
sign up?
MR. GARRE: I think obviously the members
would rejoin and form another group, Your Honor. I
mean, we’re not dealing with this in a factual vacuum.
CLS's predecessor existed at the schools for 10 years
and in --
JUSTICE ALITO: I understand the answer to
that question. So, if -- if hostile members take over
CLS, the former members of CLS can form CLS II?
(Laughter.)
MR. GARRE: If that happened Your Honor. I
mean, this has never happened ever in -- in the history
of --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's also the --
MR. GARRE: -- education.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the university's
across-the-board rules for all student conduct against
disruption, against incivility. The list would certainly
carry over.
MR. GARRE: Absolutely. And CLS, like any
group, can have a rule that disruptive members should be
expelled.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I’m sorry. I don’t
understand your --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's also never happened
from, what I can tell, that someone who disagrees with
this group has applied for membership.
MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, the record
does show that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that's -- that's
what so puzzling about the -- the case.
MR. GARRE: The record does show, Your
Honor, that there was a gay student who was a member of
the group. And that's -- let me give you that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the predecessor
group.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The predecessor group --
MR. GARRE: That was the predecessor group.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and obviously uncomfortable
with their position, so he or she left.
MR. GARRE: Well, actually --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the way it works.
MR. GARRE: -- what the record shows is that
she participated in discussions that the officer of the
group said it was a joy to have her and that both sides
learned.
I think CLS's position depends on the dark
notion that students would not have any interest in
joining a group with different viewpoints on certain
issues except to disrupt that group. And I think that
greatly undersells the intellectual curiosity of
students. It greatly undersells the fact that groups
have many different interests and perspectives.
The church has a stance in homosexuality,
but it has stances on many other issues, too. And if a
student -- even if he or she disagrees with the stance on
homosexuality, they may agree with many other aspects of
the groups, and they may want to join in the fellowship of
that group, they want to take advantage of intangible
benefits like not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Teach Bible classes?
Right?
MR. GARRE: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to let them teach
Bible classes, too, right?
MR. GARRE: In fact, the record in the --
case shows that only officers teach Bible classes,
and groups are perfectly free to structure their
organization like that. They can have requirements
that people attend certain meetings before they do that.
CLS isn't forced to have anyone lead Bible classes.
JUSTICE ALITO: If an orthodox --
MR. GARRE: CLS --
JUSTICE ALITO: If an orthodox Jewish group
or a Muslim group applied for recognition and the group
said part of our beliefs is -- one of our beliefs is that
men and women should sit separately at religious services,
would Hastings deny registration to that group?
MR. GARRE: If it was excluding students
from that group on the basis of their beliefs or their
status, then, yes, it would.
Hastings isn't in the business of
second-guessing the -- the beliefs of -- of individual
groups, and the whole point of the policy really is to
stay out of this, to just have a blanket rule that’s
equally neutral.
JUSTICE ALITO: We have -- we have two amicus
briefs from orthodox Jewish groups and a brief from a
Muslim group. So, your answer is that they could not be
recognized under Hastings' policy because of their
religious beliefs regarding the way religious services
should be conducted?
MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think even my
friend recognizes that a group could not exclude an
individual on the basis of their gender or their
beliefs -- on the basis of their gender or race.
And remember the Bob Jones case, this Court --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's because
gender or race is fundamentally different from religious
brief. Gender and race is a status. Religious belief --
it has to be based on the fundamental notion that we are
not open to everybody. We have beliefs, you have to
subscribe to them. And we’ve always regarded that as
a good thing. That type of exclusion is supported in --
in the Constitution. The other types of exclusion are
not.
MR. GARRE: But not at all costs,
Mr. Chief Justice. In the Bob Jones case, the claim was
from a -- a small private religious school that has a
sincere religious belief that people who believed in
interracial dating should not become members of their
school. And this Court, nevertheless, held that that
belief, sincere as it was, did not trump a statute that
denied education -- denied Federal financial assistance
on a viewpoint-neutral basis to schools that
discriminated on the basis of religion.
Here we have a -- a group that wants to
exclude members on the basis of sexual orientation. We
can -- CLS has tried to change that part --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You phrase it that
way. It's a group that wants to exclude -- a religious
group, a religious-oriented group, that wants to exclude
people who do not subscribe to their religious beliefs.
MR. GARRE: They -- there is a binding
judicial admission. And, again, this gets back to the
Bob Jones example. I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- yes, let's get back
to this homosexual orientation. You say that that's
established in the case.
MR. GARRE: Look at page -- J.A. page 460,
which is where the district court said that CLS made
a binding judicial admission that they wanted to
discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Keep
in mind that this case began because CLS came back to
the law school and said we’re happy to say we won't
discriminate on some grounds, but we’re not going to
say we won't exclude students on the basis of sexual
orientation.
JUSTICE BREYER: What’s supposed to happen?
I don't know the answer to this. Hastings, let's say,
or Berkeley has four or five or six different religious
chapels for services on Sunday or Saturday, and they say
we’re open to all branches of religion, orthodox Jews,
conservative, and reformed. And then the orthodox say
we want men and women to sit separately.
Now, can Hastings say or Berkeley, no, we’ll
let the reform come, we’ll let the conservatives come,
but not the -- not the orthodox Jews. They can't
have their service. Would -- would that be
constitutional?
MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think it would be
a much different case. It --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but what is your opinion?
MR. GARRE: I -- I think if the school is
regulating outside of the purposes of a limited forum,
public forum for recognized groups, then I doubt it
could go in --
JUSTICE BREYER: So if, in fact, the --
the --
MR. GARRE: -- and tell the groups --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- they have clubs and they’re
not services, and what they do is they discuss -- they
discuss the -- the nature of the service, and there can
they have separate discussions --
MR. GARRE: Where -- where --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- men from -- men and
women?
MR. GARRE: Where the rule operates on a
viewpoint-neutral basis. Here what the -- the school is
doing is it is publicly subsidizing --
JUSTICE BREYER: I guess your answer to that
is the orthodox Jews cannot. They cannot have
separate women's groups in their organization, which is
an after religious school organization.
MR. GARRE: They can exist separately. At
the school we have are numerous --
JUSTICE BREYER: Outside of the university,
et cetera.
MR. GARRE: In fact, Your Honor, it's not --
it’s not --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's their problem here.
MR. GARRE: -- unusual for schools to have
all male or all women clubs. They are not recognized
parts of the community. These -- these are activities
that are subsidized by the students themselves through the
mandatory student activities fees.
JUSTICE BREYER: And their reason to put in
a sentence as to why they don't want these orthodox Jews
to meet separately on the campus -- men in one group,
women in another -- and discuss the religious service
-- they want none like that, and their reason for wanting
none like that is?
MR. GARRE: Well, I think that's a much
different example than this case --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm trying to make it
as close as possible.
MR. GARRE: Well, I -- I may have
misunderstood the hypothetical. I mean, I think it's
a much different --
JUSTICE BREYER: They have a small orthodox
club.
MR. GARRE: The reason why the school has a
policy that all groups that it subsidizes must admit
all-comers is that, number one, it ensures that all
students enjoy equal access to all school-subsidized and
school-recognized activities.
Number two, it avoids the line-drawing
problems that we’ve discussed early this morning and I
think are necessarily going to arise and also create
strife in small educational communities.
Number three, it allows --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask about number 2,
the -- the so-called line-drawing problem? Aren't you
just letting yourself into even more line-drawing
problems?
MR. GARRE: Not with the all-comers rule.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the other -- it’s
whether you were discriminating on the basis of one of
the forbidden bases. But now you’re saying you can't
discriminate on any basis, which means there’re going
to be even more lines to have to draw. Why does it
solve your problem?
MR. GARRE: I don't think it -- that
happens at all, Justice Scalia. I think when you’ve
the policy that all students have to become members,
regardless of their status or belief, that gets the
school out of the business of determining whether,
number one, people are discriminating on the basis of an
essential belief, which is, is the way that Petitioner
describes his -- their rule.
JUSTICE ALITO: As I understood the
position, your latest position in your brief, you
really don't say you have an all-comers policy. There
are certain criteria that can be applied, like interest,
knowledge; is that correct?
MR. GARRE: Competitive-based, merit-based
requirements are not excluded. It -- they’re
not --
JUSTICE ALITO: Could a -- well, could a
group, consistent with your revised all-comers policy,
require that members who want -- anyone who wants to
become a member show a particular level of knowledge
about the subject of the group?
MR. GARRE: Yes. And I think --
JUSTICE ALITO: So if the CLS required
anybody who wanted to become a member to pass a test on
the Bible, that would be okay?
MR. GARRE: If it were truly an objective
knowledge test, it would be okay. It would be no
different than the law review. These are merits-based
determinations. There’s a fundamental difference
between excluding people on the basis of merit and
excluding people on the basis of status or belief that
has no connection to merit. That -- that, I think, is a
long-standing understanding of discrimination.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that --
that -- that's pretty tough. That has no connection to
merit. I assume there are groups that think subscribing
to their beliefs is evidence of merit, particularly
religious groups. So, how can you have a -- a test that
allows distinctions based on merit but not -- not
beliefs?
MR. GARRE: I think it goes to the nature of
whether it's discrimination under the school's policy,
and I think status or belief. People understand -- that's
why we are talking about things like race or gender or
sexual orientation, disability, military status, any
number of these things. And I think the school's policy
avoids having to draw lines as to whether or not a group
has a sufficient enough belief that military members
should become a member of the Amnesty International club
because they disagree with the war, that disabled
members should be -- disabled students should be a
member of a particular group. And the school's policy
avoids these line-drawing --
JUSTICE ALITO: If the school adopt an
all-comers policy --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question,
Mr. Garre?
JUSTICE ALITO: -- for the purpose --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one question?
I'd like you to answer, and I’d like your opponent, too:
Do you think that, in order to decide this case, we have
to pass on the constitutionality of an all-comers policy?
MR. GARRE: Yes, that's the policy before
this Court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That we must do that to decide
the case? And I want to ask your opponent the same
question.
MR. GARRE: I believe you have to do that,
because that is the policy --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So they're all --
MR. GARRE: -- before this Court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: There may be a lot of
other things we can decide, but in all events, we must
decide that much?
MR. GARRE: Absolutely. Absolutely. If I
could just discuss briefly the --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could I just ask one
quick question relating to that?
If -- if an all-comers policy is adopted for
the purpose of discriminating on the basis of viewpoint,
does it violate the First Amendment?
MR. GARRE: If it's pretextual in the Church
of Lukumi Babalu Aye sense, yes. No -- no school can
purposely discriminate at a group, no matter what policy
it adopts.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what if we think that
the policy has not been evenhandedly applied? Can't we
decide the case on that basis, and then we could just
assume arguendo Justice -- the answer to Justice
Stevens' question.
MR. GARRE: I don't think so, Justice --
Justice Kennedy, because that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- was there any proof
in this record? I mean, there’s a stipulation for summary
judgment. Was there any proof showing that it wasn't
evenly applied?
MR. GARRE: No. And I get back to the
petition for certiorari. On page 2 of the petition, the
petition --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just say, suppose
it were shown that it were not applied evenhandedly, you’d
have no problem with our saying that it’s then
unconstitutional.
MR. GARRE: It -- yes. We don't think that
that's the case here. But if a policy is applied
evenhandedly -- unevenhandedly, in a viewpoint-neutral
way and it burdens religious groups, then there’s
common ground that that policy violates the
Constitution. Of course, we think the policy here is --
JUSTICE ALITO: If this were an employment
case, and when an employee is denied promotion the
employee said it's for reason A, and then after
litigation begins the employer says, well, no, it really
wasn't for reason A, it was for reason B because of a
policy that we’ve long had, but there’s never --
there’s no written documentation of this new policy;
and then at a later point in the litigation the employer
says, well, it wasn't really either for reason A or
reason B; it was for reason C -- do you think that summary
judgment could be granted in favor of the employer on
the issue of pretext?
MR. GARRE: I think that that would create a
factual issue and that that issue might well be tried,
Justice Alito.
And the one thing that is important to keep in
mind is that this is a request for injunctive relief and not
damages. So the only policy that matters -- and Wilkinson v.
Austin makes this clear -- is the current policy; all
parties agree that the current policy is the all-comers
policy. That's the policy supported by the record in
this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry. All
parties do not agree that the policy is the all-comers
policy. Your friend argued repeatedly that the policy
was the written nondiscrimination policy.
MR. GARRE: I understood my friend's opening
brief to acknowledge at the least that that's the policy
the school has said it has today. It is the school's
policy. It’s supported by substantial history and
sworn deposition testimony.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, the -- the
so-called written policy, that has a -- that list has a
correspondence to the State's law, doesn't it?
MR. GARRE: It does.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The categories that are
listed there are the categories that under California
law are proscribed bases for discrimination?
MR. GARRE: It does. And that is an
additional basis for the school's policy. Look at
California Education Code 66270. It explicitly
prohibits discrimination in -- in programs and
educational activities by public schools like Hastings.
Hastings has an obligation under State law to prohibit
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The
reason why we’re here today is because CLS insisted
on the right to discriminate, to exclude students on the
basis of their sexual orientation.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, section 66270 applies
to programs conducted by a post-secondary educational
institution, and your position is that if -- if a
religious group complies with your policies and then it
conducts religious services, those religious services
are conducted by Hastings?
MR. GARRE: Our position is that the
registered student organization program is a program
of the university; it’s subsidized by the university;
it’s recognized by the university; and that all students
should be able to enjoy access to that program.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In your response to
Justice Ginsburg concerning California law, is it your
position that California law requires religious groups
to admit people who do not believe in their religious
beliefs and in fact to conduct services of that group?
MR. GARRE: Your Honor, our position is that
the provision that we've cited to, 66270, does not carve
out an exemption in this program for a religious student
organization. On its face --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the answer to my
question is "yes"?
MR. GARRE: Yes. On its face, it excludes --
it has an exemption for religious schools; it does not
include an exemption for religious organizations within
the context of this program. And we think that the
program is reasonable.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Garre.
MR. GARRE: Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. McConnell, you
have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McCONNELL: Well, thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice.
First, in answer to Justice Stevens'
question, we do believe that the Court needs to
reach the constitutionality of the all-comers policy as
applied to CLS in this case. We brought only an
as-applied challenge.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Put -- put to a side a
moment -- forget the as-applied. Just take a -- a pure
all-comers policy. Must we decide the constitutionality
of that?
MR. McCONNELL: Not facially, but as applied
to CLS, yes. Several other points, I know --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you talk about -- I had
understood from your brief that CLS did not have a -- a
policy of excluding people with homosexual disposition,
but that it was only homosexual conduct.
MR. McCONNELL: That's correct as
stipulated to, undisputed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- but your
complaint said otherwise. Your -- your --
MR. McCONNELL: That's -- that's because we
-- the complaint is accepting the -- Hastings'
definition of sexual orientation. We were told that our
conduct rule, our nonmarital conduct rule, violated their
sexual orientation provision, and therefore we sought
relief from their sexual orientation provision. It was
nothing more than that.
There -- it is -- it is stipulated in Joint
Stipulation 40, I believe it is, that -- that CLS's rule
is based on conduct --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.
MR. McCONNELL: -- not orientation.
Several other points: My friend twice in
his presentation stated that the all-comers policy is
simply their way of implementing the nondiscrimination
policy. But if so, it is so absurdly overbroad as to be
unconstitutional. There is no reason to stop the
environmentalist club from leading -- from requiring its
leaders to share environmentalist views --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell --
MR. McCONNELL: -- in order to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell, you don't
challenge that there are universities, including four
law schools, that have an all-comers policy?
MR. McCONNELL: So far as we’ve been able
to tell, there is no public university law school in the
country that has such a policy.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are private
universities.
MR. McCONNELL: There are some private
universities that, according to the AALS, have such a
policy. We know nothing about them. They are not in
the record, and, frankly, I’d be a little bit
surprised, because the policy is so absurd.
Think of how it would apply to the law
school itself, and this policy does apply to the law
school itself. Does Hastings really mean to say it is
committing itself to an all-comers policy when it hires
faculty or admits students? Do they not care about the
belief of its dean of admissions, about beliefs of --
about, say, affirmative action? The very idea of it is
preposterous.
JUSTICE BREYER: It's not totally, if -- but
it's imaginary, it's fantastical. The -- you could imagine
a school in the '60s that said that we think the way to
advance learning is everyone gets together in a nice
discussion group and hugs each other and talks, all
right?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's a possible
educational theory.
MR. McCONNELL: It's possible, but --
JUSTICE BREYER: They say that we are going to
apply that to everybody because that's how we do it. And --
MR. McCONNELL: Yes, but Hastings has --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- if there are any
ideological organizations that suffer --
MR. McCONNELL: But Hastings has --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- so be it, but it's
fantastical, and therefore --
MR. McCONNELL: Hastings has a perfectly
conventional RSO program just like the ones in Healy,
and Widmar and Rosenberger. They just have a policy
that is destructive of that --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, my --
MR. McCONNELL: -- of that program.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- my question is, if I can
think of this policy -- but I tend to sympathize with
your view that it's so hard to believe that they really
hold it, maybe they do, I don't know about it -- what do
I do with this case?
How can I say whether this, let's call it
"hug your neighbor policy" is -- to put a label on it
that's catchy --
MR. McCONNELL: What can --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- how do I -- how do I
evaluate that?
MR. McCONNELL: What you can say is that
Healy v. James requires a substantial justification for
exclusion of a student group from a registered student
activity forum, and this is not a substantial
justification; it is a silly justification. If it is
silly, crazy, and preposterous, it is not even reasonable,
let alone compelling or substantial.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
McConnell.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the
