JUSTICE O'CONNOR: We will now hear
argument in the case of Kelo vs. City of New London.
Mr. Bullock.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT G. BULLOCK
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BULLOCK: Justice O'Connor, and may it
please the Court:
This case is about whether there are any
limits on government's eminent domain power under the
public use requirement of the Fifth Amendment. Every
home, church or corner store would produce more tax
revenue and jobs if it were a Costco, a shopping mall
or a private office building. But if that's the
justification for the use of eminent domain, then any
city can take property anywhere within its borders
for any private use that might make more money than
what is there now.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bullock, you are
leaving out that New London was in a depressed
economic condition, so this is distinguished from the
case where the State has no particular reason for
wanting this, but the critical fact on the city side,
at least, is that this was a depressed community and
they wanted to build it up, get more jobs.
MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, it's
important to point out it -- in first place that
chapter 132 of the statutory section at issue here
applies to every city within the State of
Connecticut, not those that are simply depressed.
And there is a fundamental difference
between an area like what was at issue in Berman, an
area that actually had problems and a city that has
certain problems. Every city has problems. Every
city would like to have more tax revenue, but that
cannot be a justification for taking the property --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you concede that on
the facts, more than tax revenue was at stake. The
community had gone down and down and the town wanted
to build it up.
MR. BULLOCK: It is a desire to try to
improve the economy through tax revenue and jobs.
That is certainly the case. But that cannot be a
justification for the use of eminent domain because
if the trickle down effects of economic development
are a justification, then there really is no limit on
the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't concede, or do
you, that elevating the city from a depressed to
prosperous is a better justification than elevating a
city from prosperous to more prosperous?
MR. BULLOCK: That is not -- that is
correct, Your Honor. We do not. And chapter 132
again applies to not so prosperous cities and
prosperous cities.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The line you draw is
between blight, which Berman says was in the public
use, lighted conditions okay, but depressed
conditions, not the best in line with the --
MR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. We think
that that is a line that this Court has drawn that is
area specific that focuses on the conditions in a
particular area. And the condemnations in Berman
removed the problematic areas. It removed the
blight.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Oh, but Berman spoke,
in the opinion, said that the determination of the
legislature about these things is virtually
conclusive, that there is only the narrowest,
narrowest role for the judiciary. What kind of
standard are you proposing we should get into here to
second-guess the public use aspect?
MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, it is clear that
eminent domain power is broad, but there has to be
limits, and that's what we are really talking about
here.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, have we ever in
any case from this Court said that the limit has been
exceeded?
MR. BULLOCK: In a few cases from earlier
in this century, Your Honor, the Missouri Pacific
case, the Thompson versus Consolidated Gas case, but
this Court has recognized for over 200 years that
there are limits on eminent domain power, that they
cannot be used for private cases. And that has been
a consistent strain throughout this Court's --
JUSTICE BREYER: Justice Douglas says
there that as long as it's an objective within
Congress and legislature's legitimate grant of power,
they can do it, I mean, as long as there's a -- so
why does there have to be a limit within that broad
limit?
MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, the limit
is that there cannot be takings for private use.
JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, there can't,
purely. But there is no taking for private use that
you could imagine in reality that wouldn't also have
a public benefit of some kind, whether it's
increasing jobs or increasing taxes, et cetera.
That's a fact of the world.
And so given that fact of the world, that
is law, why shouldn't the law say, okay, virtually
every taking is all right, as long as there is some
public benefit which there always is and it's up to
the legislature.
MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, we think that
that cuts way too broadly. And it puts --
JUSTICE BREYER: Because?
MR. BULLOCK: Because then every property,
every home, every business can then be taken for any
private use. For any private development project.
JUSTICE BREYER: No. It could only be
taken if there is a public use and there almost
always is. Now, do you agree with that, or do you
not agree with my last empirical statement?
MR. BULLOCK: Well, again, the eminent
domain power is broad, but there has to be limits.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's, of course,
my question. The question is, if you agree with the
empirical statement that there almost always is some
public benefit attached, then my question is, why
must there be a limit within that broad framework?
MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, I think
with public -- with just having a simple public
benefit, then there really is no distinction between
public and private uses. And that is what we call
upon this Court to state, for instance, in the Berman
case and in the Midkiff case, which we think are
really at the outer limits of government's eminent
domain --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But do you think those
were correctly decided or do you take issue with the
decision in those two cases?
MR. BULLOCK: We think that those
decisions can be consistent with ruling in favor of
Petitioners in this particular case, Your Honor,
because --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But you take the
position that a city that is suffering from enormous
lack of jobs and depression, economic depression,
that there is no public use purpose for taking land
to enable the creation of jobs?
MR. BULLOCK: That is correct, Your Honor.
We do not --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's assume that
the city instead of taking the property by eminent
domain simply used its, its own -- some of its own
regular tax income to buy up the property, and
assembled parcels of land with the purpose of selling
them to an industrial developer to raise the tax base
and hence ultimately to raise taxes.
Would you say just within the meaning of
general understanding of proper governmental purposes
that the city was acting in a way that had no
legitimate public purpose?
MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, I think
the question goes to whether or not the government
could use its police power to acquire property and
then sell it to a private developer.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm not interested
in the label. I'm just saying if the government says
we need to increase the tax base because we have a
depressed city, so we are going to take some of our
tax money now, and we are just going to buy up
property that people are willing to sell to us, and
we are going to assemble parcels. And when we get a
big enough one, we are going to sell it to a
developer for industrial purposes. And that will,
that will raise the tax base. Is there anything
illegitimate as a purpose for governmental spending
in doing that?
MR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor. We do not
believe that that would be some legitimate because
it's not a public use.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't there a public
purpose here?
MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, because
this case affects the eminent domain power, which is
regulated by the Fifth Amendment --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but we are talking
about -- I mean, I realize that, but I mean, I
thought your point was that it was use of eminent
domain power for an improper purpose. And you
characterize that purpose as conveying property to
private owners.
Well, in my example, the same thing is
going on except that it's not using the eminent
domain power. If the purpose in my example is a
proper public purpose, why isn't it a proper public
purpose when the government does it by eminent
domain? What changes about the purpose?
MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, because of the
public use restriction of the Amendment. That's what
we really --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bullock, do you
equate purpose with use? Are the two terms the same?
Does the public use requirement mean nothing more
than that it have a public purpose?
MR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's your answer to
Justice Souter.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But if that is your
answer then the slum clearance cases have got to go
the other way.
MR. BULLOCK: I'm sorry --
JUSTICE SOUTER: If that is your answer,
then I suppose the slum clearance cases were wrongly
decided.
MR. BULLOCK: Well, your Honor, this Court
did hold in Berman and Midkiff that the police power
and eminent domain power are coterminous. That was a
holding especially of this Court's opinion in
Midkiff. And there are certain amici that have been
filed in this case, amicus briefs filed in this case
that have called upon this Court to re-examine that.
And of course, this Court is free to do so.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But you are saying we
don't have to re-examine it, but I think your
adoption of Justice Scalia's approach puts you in a
difficult -- I think you're moving in the direction
of saying we really have got to overrule the prior
cases.
MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I think under
a -- perhaps an original understanding of the takings
clause, there was a difference between public use and
public domain.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Just for the moment, what
about my question? And you can get into history, if
you want to, and I tend to be interested in that, but
my immediate concern is, if you give the answer that
you have just given, doesn't it jeopardize the
precedent of the slum clearance cases?
MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I don't think
so, because of the caveat in Berman and Midkiff that
eminent domain cannot be used for private uses. And
that is what is really at issue here. What I think
was the focus of --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's what they
were being used for in Berman and -- everybody knows
that private developers were the beneficiaries in
Berman.
MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I believe the
justifications focused upon the removal of the
offensive conditions in Berman, that the public
purpose, if you want to call it that, was served once
the blight was removed, the public purpose was served
once the oligopoly was broken up. Here the focus is
that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: As I understand, you're
test then -- you want me to make a distinction between
blight which is a permissible governmental use,
governmental objective and economic revival, which
isn't?
MR. BULLOCK: Under the eminent domain
authority, Your Honor, we think that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the line you
want me to draw.
MR. BULLOCK: Yes. And we think that that
is a line --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose an
economist or even a judge might say, well, it's
very clear that if this economic depression continues
for another five years we are going to have blight.
Blight is in the eye of the beholder, I know that.
MR. BULLOCK: Exactly. And I think that
that is really one of the dangers of the majority
opinion here is that it puts any property up for
grabs. Under the blight statutes, they actually have
to -- governments have to meet a certain objective
criteria to satisfy that this is actually a blighted
area.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't it an
objective criteria to say that we are going to have
economic revival, avoid economic downturns?
MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, because, I
think -- to get back to the decisions in Berman and
Midkiff, what this Court I think focused on there is
that the public use or the public purpose was direct
and immediate. It was served directly by the
condemnations and it was immediately served by the
removal of the blight and the breaking up of the
oligopoly.
In economic development condemnations, the
only public benefits that come about, if they come
about at all, are completely dependent upon private
parties actually making a profit. And that those
profits then somehow --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the same thing
that is true in the railroads in the west.
MR. BULLOCK: But --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Precisely the
description you gave applied to the railroads in the
west.
MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, those were
justified under I think the line of cases that held
that those were really essential for land assembly
for instrumentalities of commerce. They were --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this seems to be
really essential for the purpose of developing
industrial property to increase the tax base. The
argument is, and I don't know of any reason to doubt
it, that doing it seriatim by voluntary acquisition
and sale doesn't work.
So the rationale for this is essentially
the rationale for the railroads, for the public
utility line condemnations and so on. There isn't
another practical way to do it. And there is a
public benefit at the end, and that ought to qualify
it as a public use.
MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, there are many
ways to do economic development without condemnation.
It happens every single day in this country. And in
the states that prohibit the use of eminent domain
simply for private business development, those states
do make the distinction between blighted areas and
simply their communities wanting to take advantage of
more tax revenue. And those states are doing fine.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though in Berman,
there was a department store that was not blighted,
and it was permissible because the whole area was to
be improved to raze that department store, even
though it wasn't contributing in any way to blight.
MR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. But the
Court in Berman held that there were certain
properties that even though they might have been
nonblighted, it was essential to have those
properties in order to remove the blight from the
area that was at issue. So there was the ability of
government to get certain properties even though they
might have been nonblighted. Here --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Bullock, would you
articulate the test that you would propose the Court
adopt. Some amici and others have argued that we
should use the substantially advances test, so-called
test from regulatory takings. What tests do you
articulate?
MR. BULLOCK: Well, for our bright line
rule, Your Honor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.
MR. BULLOCK: The test should be that the
government cannot take property simply so that the
new owners can put it to ordinary private uses of
land. That's really the test. And the --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's not what's
asserted here, of course. Here the city says, we are
doing this for purposes of enhancing economic
development of a very poor city.
MR. BULLOCK: True, Your Honor, but --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So what do we do with
that alleged purpose? What is your test?
MR. BULLOCK: Well, the test, Your Honor,
for --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it no economic
development purpose?
MR. BULLOCK: Yes. Yes. When it's only
justified in order to gain the secondary benefits
from ordinary private uses of land, and the way that
businesses always make use of their land to try to
make money or to try to make a profit. That's our
bright line rule.
But for our second test, if this Court
accepts that economic development can be a public
use, then we advocate a test of reasonably
foreseeable uses and minimum standards in order to
counter the dangers posed by such private involvement
in the use of eminent domain power.
JUSTICE BREYER: What's the latter. I
mean, I understand the former. That's a big retreat
and it comes to me now you're getting to what I
think is a possible realm of reason here. But the
second part now you said and minimum standards.
What minimum standards?
MR. BULLOCK: Well, the dissent in the
Connecticut Supreme Court talked a lot about minimum
standards that should be in place in order to ensure
--
that public benefits actually come about. Those
could be such things as a commencement date for the
project, a construction schedule, financial
eligibility for the developers, there's a number of
different things.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, I mean, are you
advocating particular ones?
MR. BULLOCK: Not particular ones, just
the standard actually be in place and we think that
the dissent provides some good guideposts for
establishing --
JUSTICE BREYER: The remaining test is the
JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that approaching --
Isn't that in effect changing the test from public
use to efficient public use? I mean, what's -- you
know, if I condemn land for a public utility and the
public utility turns out to be very inefficient, has
the condemnation been invalid?
MR. BULLOCK: No. Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want us to sit
here and evaluate the prospects of each condemnation
one by one?
MR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor, what we are
advocating for, and utilities of course are
justified, have long been justified under a separate
line of cases, common carrier regulations.
But what we are talking about are certain
minimum standards in place at the time of
condemnation to try to have some type of reasonable
certainty that the public benefits are to come about
so we are not talking about ongoing oversight. We
are simply talking about minimum standards at the
time of the, at the time of the condemnation.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it there isn't,
but maybe there is, there isn't any question in this
case that the city was acting in good faith and
did -- and I presume still does -- intend to convey
it to developers who will, will actually proceed to
develop a project. Is there a question about that?
MR. BULLOCK: A question of whether or not
the procedure --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, in other words, I
can understand perfectly well, why we would want to
draw a distinction between the use of the eminent
domain power that takes a parcel of property from
private person A and simply then reconveys it to
private person B without any particular object in
mind except that the city likes B, you know, the
mayor is the Democrat and B is the Democrat. That
kind of thing.
So I can understand the need for some
distinction between that case and what we've got
here. The question is when you say there have to be
minimum standards, I guess, is do we have a problem
historically or in this case about the good faith of
the taking so that we need the minimum standards to
make sure that we are not getting into the first
example?
MR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. And there
is a number of reasons why there has to be reasonably
foreseeable uses --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there a reason in this
case? Is there some doubt here?
MR. BULLOCK: Well, it goes to the doubt
about whether or not the public benefits will
actually come about in this case. The takings here
are really for speculative purposes, pure speculative
purposes. And that's where the minimum standards
come into play to ensure --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But do you really want
courts to be in the business of trying to weigh the
evidence to see if the utility will be successful or
the hospital will be successful or the road will be
well constructed? I mean, what kind of a test are
you proposing?
MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, our test is
limited really to the condemnations that are
completely dependent upon the private businesses
actually being successful, and that those benefits
coming about so it would not affect utilities or
anything like that. But at a minimum, this Court
should require that the government actually name a
use.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does the record tell us
anything about how often takings by eminent domain
for economic development occur in this country? Is
it frequent? What are we dealing with?
MR. BULLOCK: It is, it is frequent, Your
Honor. There's no -- we do not know of any study
that looks specifically at condemnations for economic
development, but after the Michigan court's decision
in Poletown, they became commonplace.
And you had properties -- business that
were being condemned for casinos, other homes that
were taken for automobile manufacturers. And the
Michigan Supreme Court saw that as a disaster. And
overturned that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In all of those cases, I
think the economic feasibility or economic success
test would have been easily met. I mean, what you're
doing is trying to protect some economic value/ But
I think it's pretty clear that most economists would
say this development wouldn't happen unless there is
a foreseeable chance of success.
Let me ask you this, and it's a little
opposite of the particular question presented. Are
there any writings or scholarship that indicates that
when you have property being taken from one private
person ultimately to go to another private person,
that what we ought to do is to adjust the measure of
compensation, so that the owner -- the condemnee --
can receive some sort of a premium for the
development?
MR. BULLOCK: There may be some
scholarship about that. This Court has consistently
held that the property owner is simply entitled to
just compensation of the appraised value of the
property. Of course, the property owner --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you have to prescind
the project when you fix the value.
MR. BULLOCK: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You have to prescind the
project -- you have to -- you have to ignore the
project when you determine the value. The value is a
willing buyer and a willing seller, without reference
to the project.
MR. BULLOCK: Yes, that is right. And so
they simply get the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what I am asking is
if there has been any scholarship to indicate that
maybe that compensation measure ought to be adjusted
when A is losing property for the economic benefit of
MR. BULLOCK: I believe there has been
some scholarship about it, but we think it's vital
that there be a public use requirement in those
takings as well.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you about the
standard. Go back for a second.
MR. BULLOCK: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: I gather that the Iowa
courts have a standard that includes whether there is
a reasonable likelihood that the intended public use
will take place. Now, is that the standard you're
advocating?
MR. BULLOCK: It's similar to our
reasonable foreseeability test that we set forth in
our brief that this Court actually talked about in
the Vester case as well, and a number of the other
state cases that are cited in our brief that
establish that there has to be a use for the property
and that that use has to be reasonably perceived.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a lot of
disagreement about this?
MR. BULLOCK: No, there's not.
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it seems to me
you might -- whether there is a reasonable assurance
that there will in fact be the public use which the
state uses as the justification for taking the
property. Is that going to help you that much?
MR. BULLOCK: I think it will provide
important minimal standards of protection for --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, I don't see
how this Court could get into the business of saying
you have to have this by a particular day or you have
to have 14 witnesses. I mean, we couldn't impose
that sort of thing, could we?
MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I think just the
standard needs to be in place.
JUSTICE BREYER: There needs to be a
reasonable assurance.
MR. BULLOCK: Exactly. Or at the very
least, a reasonable foreseeability as well, which is
at a minimum that is not even in place in this
particular case. And the majority of state courts
that have looked at this, that is a wel established
doctrine.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, they might well
need it here.
MR. BULLOCK: Not in this case, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you do that area
by area? I mean, one of the points you made, this is
divided into what, seven areas?
MR. BULLOCK: Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there's some -- to
be developed first, you say that your clients lived
in parcels that are not likely to be developed soon,
if at all. So when making this determination, is
development reasonably likely, do you have to do it
parcel by parcel or can it be with the whole --
MR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor. We believe
it should be done where the property is actually
being conveyed. And we think that that is the
proper -- that is the proper test.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's not the area
development but this house, will there be -- is it
reasonably likely that there will be development in
that particular plot.
MR. BULLOCK: In this particular parcel,
that is correct, Your Honor, and that has been
supported by ruling in just about every
condemnation --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you, I'm
sorry, I'll make this a quick question. Why do you
think it is necessary, given your position, why do
you think it's necessary to adopt the test you've
just articulated as distinct simply from a good faith
requirement. So that if somebody objected and
offered to prove bad faith, that would be in effect a
defense for the taking?
MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, because that
does not really provide any protection to property
owners. The intent to benefit a private party, and
the intent to benefit the public are really one and
the same in these types of condemnations.
And we believe it is imperative at a
minimum because the condemnations are dependent upon
private parties even being successful that there has
to be reasonable foreseeable uses. And also, if this
Court so chooses, minimum standards in place to
ensure that those benefits actually go to the public.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Very well. Mr. Horton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. HORTON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HORTON: Justice O'Connor, and may it
please the Court:
The principal purpose of the takings
clause is to provide for just compensation. Now, I
want to very briefly state two reasons why you do not
want to make a --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but it has to be
for a valid public use.
MR. HORTON: Yes, it does, Your Honor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay.
MR. HORTON: I completely agree with that,
but if the primary purpose of the takings clause is
not to regulate legislative determinations of that,
but it seems to me that what the opposition is asking
for is two tests.
One for Berman and Midkiff and National
Railroad, and another test for Kelo. There is no
principle basis for a court to make what is really a
value judgment about whether a long-term plan to
revive an economically depressed city is a public use
of a higher or lower rank constitutionally --
JUSTICE BREYER: But he doesn't -- he
doesn't, his second test does not adopt that. The
second test which he was arguing at the end is just
that there has to be a reasonable assurance that the
public use, and it could include all those things,
will in fact take place.
MR. HORTON: Yes, Justice Breyer. And I
noted his remark because that's actually in
concession because that's the test the Connecticut
Supreme Court imposed. And they have --
JUSTICE BREYER: That may be, but what do
you think of that test?
MR. HORTON: I don't, I don't agree. I
don't think it's necessary to do that, because if you
have that test, you have to say, well, what do I do
about, about other areas than this.
Berman is an excellent example of that,
because as Justice Ginsburg said, Mr. Berman's
property was not blighted. You needed to take
Mr. Berman's property in order for the economic
development that was going to occur later on.
And the question is, was it reasonably
assured that the economic development -- in fact,
some of the other side's amicus briefs say that that
worked out terribly down there, and all it was was
discriminating against the poor and, and poverty
stricken people and it didn't accomplish any goal --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Horton, what, what
difference does it make that, that New London was in
an economic depression? Would it not be fully as
much, under your theory of a public use, for a city
to say, yes, we are not doing badly, but we could do
better. Let's attract some high-tech industry here.
You can't possibly draw a line between depressed
cities and undepressed cities, can you?
MR. HORTON: I would not draw a line.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't. And you
wouldn't ask us to do it either.
MR. HORTON: I would not ask -- I have a
back-up argument that you do not need to reach that
issue here in light of the facts of this case. But
I -- to be candid with you, my view is that the test
you have is -- there is no principle --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Any city can do it. And
in the hypothetical that Justice Souter gave earlier
where, you know, you couldn't take it from A and give
it to B, because B is a good Democrat, you could take
it from A and give it to B if B is richer, and would
pay higher municipal taxes, couldn't you?
MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. But I have
a caveat on that. If you're talking about one
property, you're very likely to have a Willowbrook
versus Oleck problem about discrimination, you know,
intentional discrimination against somebody else's
property.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I just want to take
property from people who are paying less taxes and
give it to people who are paying more taxes. That
would be a public use, wouldn't it?
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: For example, Motel 6
and the city thinks, well, if we had a Ritz-Carlton,
we would have higher taxes. Now, is that okay?
MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. That would
be okay. I -- because otherwise you're in the
position of drawing the line. I mean, there is,
there is a limit. I mean --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if that, if that's
so then the occasional statements that we see in the
writing that you can't take from A to give to B is
just wrong?
MR. HORTON: No. I don't agree with that.
A good example is -- well, there is Missouri Pacific.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think you can't take
from A to give to B, that there is some substance and
force to that proposition?
MR. HORTON: There is some force to it. I
certainly wouldn't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me qualify it. You
can take from A to give to B if B pays more taxes?
MR. HORTON: If it's a significant amount.
Obviously, there is a cost --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll accept that. You
can take from A and give to B if B pays significantly
more taxes.
MR. HORTON: With that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You accept that as a
proposition?
MR. HORTON: I do, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But without the
addition, I'd please like an answer to your question.
MR. HORTON: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: There are statements in
our cases that say you cannot take from A just to
give to B.
MR. HORTON: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that there
is substance to that proposition and that that
proposition is correct?
MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. I do. And
to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that exactly
what happened in Berman?
MR. HORTON: Your Honor, in Berman, the --
what has --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't that exactly what
always happens unless it's for a firehouse or a
school?
MR. HORTON: Your Honor, my position is
that purely taking from one person to give to another
that shows no public benefit other than just giving
from -- taking from one person to another would not
be a public use.
A good example is the Missouri Pacific
case. The one case in 200 years of this Court's
jurisprudence where you have, in fact, struck such a
taking that was not a regulatory taking.
I would also point out that there are a
few cases around the country where it does not
include Justice Scalia's hypothetical about
additional taxes.
An excellent example of that is the case
the other side has cited from New Jersey. Casino
Properties versus Bannon, where the Trump Association
just wanted a parking lot that was next door. There
was no assembly problem. No problem putting small
parcels together. There was no talk in the case
about taxes or more taxes or more jobs or anything.
It -- the trial judge there didn't say it
was just for a public purpose -- a private purpose,
but he said it was overwhelmingly just for the Trump
organization's -- so, I mean, if you include Justice
Scalia's hypothetical about more taxes, then I say
that's sufficient, as long as you get over --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that what the
Connecticut Supreme Court that we are reviewing said,
you -- you are arguing, it seems to me, for something
that goes beyond what was adjudicated in this case.
I mean --
MR. HORTON: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a finding, a
finding before to be a fact in the trial court that
this development was going to be primarily for the
benefit of the citizens of New London, and not for
the benefit of Pfizer or the private developer.
MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. I agree
with that and that is why I say my back-up position
is you don't need to determine whether you go beyond
economic depression of a city in this particular
case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a factual
finding? You consider that a factual finding?
MR. HORTON: I think it's a mixed question
of fact and law --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that this is
primarily for the benefit of the city of New London,
not for the benefit of a --
MR. HORTON: I consider that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: In the eye of the
beholder, to whom do you think this does greater
benefit to, not a factual finding.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: When, when there is no
condemnation to acquire property for the direct use
of the public, as for a public right-of-way, or a
utility path or something, where it's purely economic
development, is there any reason why we shouldn't
draw a clear line and say that isn't a public
purpose. Let them go out and deal with -- buy it on
the market, on the open market. What's the matter
with that?
MR. HORTON: Well, for one thing we have
in this case, and this comes back to the point about
this particular case, is a severe assembly problem.
We have 115 properties we are talking about on this
-acre plot, and there is 32 acres that come from
one place, from --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let's look at the
specifics here. Pfizer is already in place. That's
happened.
MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So what are these
parcels of the people now before us going to be used
for?
MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. First of
all, it's a long-range plan. If I could have, if I
could have the chart, please, if I may show you Your
Honor.
The -- we are out on a peninsula here, and
here is Pfizer down here, which at the time of the
taking was almost completed. They moved in a month
afterwards. Up here is an old state -- old fort from
the 19th century that the state agreed to turn into a
state park as part of an overall plan. The overall
plan is this whole thing.
Now, parcel one is going to be a hotel, is
planned for a hotel. Parcel two was planned --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Let's talk about the
litigants.
MR. HORTON: Yes.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Before us today.
MR. HORTON: Yes. That's right. They are
in parcel 3 and they are in parcel 4-A. Now, the --
it's to be developed in phases. The first phase is
one and two. The next phase is then three and four,
A, and there is also a marina --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's planned for 3
and 4-A?
MR. HORTON: What's planned for 3 is that
it's going to be office space. And the expectation
is there is going to be a demand for class A office
space, which is the best quality office space in this
area by 2010. And the expectation is that it will
attract the sorts of offices that will feed on the
Pfizer. They spent $300 million on a site here.
In addition, I may point out, this is the
Amtrak line going along here. The only way you can
get to parcels 1 and 2 is to go right by parcel 3 or
go right by parcel 4-A.
This is a waste water treatment facility.
Parcel 4-A is for park support or marina support.
Now, it isn't more definitive, but obviously, one
possible use is for parking here because you've got a
waste water treatment facility here. You've got the
park here. You've got the marina here and you've got
the other parcels here.
It's not like we are talking, as in
Berman, you're talking about something that's in the
parcel. And in Berman, they said it's not for the
court to decide where the boundary lines ought to be.
It seems to me that's another point, Justice
O'Connor. It's not like parcel 3 --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, can't the courts at
least -- can't the courts, could the courts -- do you
object to this, and I'm not advocating it, I want
your reaction.
MR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Could the courts, under
this clause, at least review what you've just said
for reasonableness? I mean, look at the
reasonableness of a claim that this is for --
basically for a public use. Look at the
reasonableness of the claim that we should do it this
way, rather than excusing the people who don't want
to sell their houses no matter what and doing it a
little bit differently.
Reasonableness is a concept that's already
in the Constitution in terms of what the legislature
can do, but I'm thinking of the stronger kind of
reasonableness review that you might have in an
administrative action. Now, is, Overton Park, if you
want a case. Is that a possible kind of review that
you might find appropriate here?
MR. HORTON: No, Your Honor, if what
you're defining as reasonableness is being higher
than rational basis. Because in that situation,
you're applying a higher standard for a taking where
we are paying for it than you would be for --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the reason that you
would apply a somewhat higher standard is because the
rational basis, with tremendous deference, applies to
the power of Congress to act in an economic area in
the absence of a particular constitutional provision
designed to protect a minority from the actions of
the majority.
And if you read that public purpose
doctrine, a section here as having that in mind, you
might want a somewhat higher level of review. Now,
that's the whole thing spelled out. I'm not
advocating it. But I am putting it forward to get --
to get your reaction.
MR. HORTON: Your Honor, that same type of
remark could be made about rational basis equal
protection review.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, and indeed with equal
protection, we very often do have a somewhat higher
standard of review.
MR. HORTON: Ah, yes, Your Honor, but the
point here is that you should not have a higher
standard of review because we are paying for it. It
would be ironic to have a higher test than for
example in a regulatory taking or even the same test.
You have a test in Nollan and Dolan, for example,
which is an exactions case. So that's to say --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Horton, you're paying
for it, but you're also taking property from somebody
who doesn't want to sell it. Does that count for
nothing? Yes, you're paying for it, but you're
giving the money to somebody who doesn't want the
money, who wants to live in the house that she's
lived in her whole life. That counts for nothing?
MR. HORTON: No, of course not, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, let me ask --
would, would the reasonableness standard, if the
project is indeed reasonable, and there is genuine
prospect that all of these good things that you're
talking about will happen, why wouldn't private money
come in to further the project? Why is it necessary
to condemn it if it's so reasonable. Why couldn't
you, you -- now, you say there is a holdout for one
part, parcel. Couldn't the city fund a private
purchase of that parcel? Say, you know, we'll make
funds available out of our general tax revenue to
somebody who wants to come in and put together this
system? Of course, that person has to buy out
property owners, but we'll, we'll give you money to
buy them out at high prices.
MR. HORTON: Your Honor, there are some
plaintiffs who are not going to sell at any price.
They want to stay there. You've got a severe
assembly problem in this case and it's not as though
you can say, well, go somewhere else.
You have a situation where you've got the
Pfizer plant that is being built there. You've got
the state park that's there. You've got this Naval
underseas facility that just came on the market.
That's the only place anything is going to work and
it's -- and it's five to six square miles of town. I
mean, there is no other place to go.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How much, how much of
this was voluntarily sold, is that correct?
MR. HORTON: The large share of it was,
but of course, that's because there is always in the
background the possibility of being able to condemn
it. I mean, that obviously facilitates a lot of
voluntary sales. And if, if this is not -- if this
is not -- let me put it this way. I mean, there is
going to be a more severe holdout problem.
JUSTICE BREYER: That may be. Now, that's
why I'm back to reasonableness. You see, we are told
in the briefs that the people who often might hold
out, might be doing so to get more money, but it
might also be because they are poor, they are not
well connected politically, and their only hope is to
go to a court and stop this thing.
So you'd give them two weapons. Weapon
one is you have to pay them. That's correct.
Compensation. And weapon two is they can put you to
a test of being reasonable. That might be quite a
deferential test, so you might have every leg up.
But they at least could catch the instances where
this is really not reasonable to do to them what
you're doing to them that they don't want.
MR. HORTON: I have two responses to that,
Your Honor. First of all, that applies to all sorts
of takings. If I'm building a road, let me give you
an example of the Rindge case that Your Honors
decided in the 1920s.
That was the road to nowhere. It was a
road that went through a farm to the county line.
And the other county had no intention at that point
of building a road, but Your Honors said, well, they
might get around to it at sometime so it's a good
idea to build it now.
We had a similar situation in Hartford.
There is supposed to be a ring road around Hartford,
and the State condemned all this land for a ring road
around Hartford. Well, one little bit of it was done
and then just this, this year, in very low print in
the last page of the newspaper, we see about the
state getting around to selling the land because they
didn't, they didn't do it.
I mean, this can happen in the railroad
case is a good example. The railroad case. The one
Your Honors decided. If it's -- being a common
carrier makes all the difference, then how come the
ICC just didn't order the Boston & Maine to fix the
railroad? You know. Why? You know, you didn't look
to make a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Common carriers are
subject to state regulation to a degree that private
companies are not. They must, they must treat all
comers alike. I mean, I don't think the public
utility cases are at all comparable to condemning
land in order to get a new company to move in and pay
more taxes. I just don't think it's similar.
MR. HORTON: Well, I would like to point
out that the -- there is a difference, the whole
point is about having a test about reasonable
assurances about whether something is going to happen
and that's where the railroad case makes a
difference.
QUESTION: I agree with you on that.
MR. HORTON: That's the only point I was
making, Your Honor. I didn't mean to go further than
that. But coming back to Justice Breyer's point, you
made a point about poor people. And I'd like to
point out, unless you're going to overrule Berman,
you know, poor people and minorities are more likely
to be vulnerable in the blight cases than in this
case.
I mean, this is a good example. Economic
development can take place anywhere in town. Blight
happens in one area of town where the poor and the
minorities are likely to live, and in fact, this very
case, we have got middle class people. There is no
blight that's been alleged in the condemnation
papers.
The other thing is if you stick to blight,
this is the problem you're going to have. You're
going to end up making a blight jurisprudence
because -- because what's going to happen is the
cities are going to say, we can only do this by
blight, so they are going to have marginal
definitions of blight.
Florida, for example, says property is
blighted if it's vacant. Is that blight? I mean,
you're going to have a big headache in that --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm accepting that
you can't make that kind of a distinction. That's
where I'm focusing on a test that would possibly
apply only where you transfer property from one
private person to another, but still wouldn't make
those distinctions of blight or not blight.
MR. HORTON: Yes. But I mean, the other
thing is, are you going to make -- would the Court
make a distinction between a case where the city is
doing the developing itself, and another case where
the city gives it to a private person.
I'd like to point out, my client is going
to keep the property. It's -- it's going to be
leased to a developer. It's not going to be sold to
the developer. So I mean, if this developer builds a
building on this property, and then doesn't comply,
they are in big trouble.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It does seem ironic that
0 percent of the premium for the new development
goes to the, goes to the developer and to the
taxpayers and not to the property owner.
MR. HORTON: Well, that's an interesting
point. A question was raised earlier about the other
side about whether there should be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The compensation
measures.
MR. HORTON: The compensation measures.
Exactly. By the way, the answer to your question is
if there is some -- if there is some scholarly
articles on that, I'm not aware of it either.
But I would point out that's something,
you know, in terms of social costs and things like
that, that is something that this Court might or
might not wish to consider in a just compensation
case, but I don't think it should affect whether you
take the property or not. It seems to me that is --
I'm not taking a position on that one way or another,
but it seems to me that's -- you have to assume in
this case that there is going to be just
compensation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: On that point, just in
Connecticut, if the property owner goes to the jury
and receives more than the state offered, does the
state also have to pay those attorneys' fees?
MR. HORTON: Under -- under state law?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under Connecticut law,
if the property owner is offered $100 but goes to the
jury and gets $200, does the property owner have to
pay the attorneys' fees or does the state pay the
attorneys' fees?
MR. HORTON: The state does not pay
attorneys' fees, Your Honor. Everybody pays his own
attorneys' -- and likewise, the other way, if it's
lower amount than what was put in than, you know,
it's not as though the state gets attorneys' fees
back. It works both ways.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Horton, what do you
think is the reason that there are not a lot of
examples of the sort that I think one of Justice
O'Connor's hypotheticals raised, in which the, I
don't know, the Econoline Motel gets condemned so
that the Ritz can be built, thereby increasing tax
revenue and so on, kind of parcel by parcel
augmentations to the tax base and so on. Why aren't
there a lot of examples like that?
MR. HORTON: I think there is two good
reasons for it, and that it's a theoretical more than
a practical problem. First of all, you've got all
sorts of transaction costs when you, when you go
through eminent domain, as opposed to doing things
voluntarily.
So you are not going to do things -- as a
as a practical matter, to take Justice Scalia's
earlier example, for one piece of property because of
the transaction costs involved. I mean, you're never
going to make up -- unless it's to, you know, to
favor the governor's friend or something like that,
as you say.
JUSTICE SOUTER: In which case we have a
different --
MR. HORTON: In which case you have a
different problem. The Willowbrook versus Oleck
test.
QUESTION: Okay. So we have transaction
costs.
MR. HORTON: Transaction costs, but that
is a serious problem. And the other thing, there is
the democratic process, Your Honor. I mean,
especially if the taxpayers are paying for something
and you know, they are getting a bad reason or run
around about the reason, you know, that's subject to
review.
It seems to me democracy can make good
decisions and -- or bad decisions under the
Constitution, but the important thing is that when
it's paid for, it's not like regulatory takings which
are, you know, the taxpayers don't see that until
it's too late. You know, in this type of taking, the
taxpayers are seeing up front what's going on.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's true. But now,
put yourself in the position of the homeowner. I
take it, if it's a forced sale, it's at the market
value, the individual, let's say it's someone who has
lived in his house his whole life. He bought the
house for $50,000. It's worth half a million. He
has 450,000 profit.
He pays 30 percent to the Government and
the state in taxes, and then he has to live
somewhere. Well, I mean, what's he supposed to do?
He now has probably 350,000 to pay for a house. He
gets half a house because that's all he is going to
do, all he is going to get for that money after he
paid the taxes, or whatever.
And I mean, there are a lot of -- and he
has to move and so forth. So going back to Justice
Kennedy's point, is there some way of assuring that
the just compensation actually puts the person in the
position he would be in if he didn't have to sell his
house? Or is he inevitably worse off?
MR. HORTON: Well, I mean, first of all,
the -- in Connecticut, fortunately, we have
relocation loans which are involved here. And they
are available in this case.
There was, it wasn't clear from our brief
whether they were loans or not, and it is correct
that they are loans. The other side pointed out that
that was for all projects in the state. That's not
true, you know, I mean, there is $10 million involved
in relocation funds.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But the loans don't make
him whole. Isn't --
MR. HORTON: That's true.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, what bothered
Justice Breyer I guess bothers a lot of us. And that
is, is there a problem of making the homeowner or the
property owner whole? But I suppose the answer to
that is that goes to the measure of compensation
which is not the issue here.
MR. HORTON: Yes. And that's, and I had
said that earlier. But another point when I was
talking about roads is that applies to -- that could
apply to any type of case. It doesn't just apply to
a case like this.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that would really
overrule a bunch of prior cases and really throw
condemnation law into chaos.
MR. HORTON: Yes. And Justice Scalia, a
question you -- or actually it was a comment you had
made about public use versus public purpose. And
that would not only overrule -- and my opposing
counsel said there is a difference between the two.
And when pressed by Justice Souter -- and I would
point out, that's just overruling cases going back to
Berman. That's overruling two decisions by --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is the remedy?
Let's repose the problem to which I want to remedy
then. And maybe this isn't the right remedy.
But the remedy that they are saying, and
I'm really repeating it, is an individual has a house
and they want to be really not made a lot worse off,
at least not made a lot worse off just so some other
people can get a lot more money. Now what, what is
the right -- is there no constitutional protection?
If this isn't the right case, what is?
MR. HORTON: Well, the right case is in
the just compensation concept, but going to your,
your point, if this were here as just compensation, I
would say in terms of just compensation, in deciding
what the fair market value is today, you can
certainly take into account the economic plan that's
going into effect. You know --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Really? I thought that
that was a fundamental of condemnation law that you
can not value the property being taken based on what
it's going to be worth after the project. That's
just --
MR. HORTON: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Unless Connecticut law
is much different from any other state.
MR. HORTON: I may have misspoken on that
subject, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You didn't misspeak. But
you know, in any case --
MR. HORTON: I apologize, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What this lady wants is
not more money. No amount of money is going to
satisfy her. She is living in this house, you know,
her whole life and she does not want to move. She
said I'll move if it's being taken for a public use,
but by God, you're just giving it to some other
private individual because that individual is going
to pay more taxes. I -- it seems to me that's,
that's an objection in principle, and an objection in
principle that the public use requirement of the
Constitution seems to be addressed to.
MR. HORTON: But as I say, Your Honor, if
public use and public purpose are the same thing,
which they are unless you're going to overrule
Holmes' decisions from 1905 and 1906.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't the first of
Holmes' decisions to be overruled.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I think you'd
have to take some substantial chunks of language out
of Berman as well, because Justice Douglas spoke very
expansively in that case.
MR. HORTON: Plus I think Holmes was right
when he said that to say that the public actually has
to use the property is not an appropriate meaning of
the phrase, so I would not think you'd want to
revisit that case, even if you want to revisit some
other of Holmes' decisions.
But the -- I guess the best answer I have,
Justice Breyer, to your question, after I, after I
misspoke is simply to go back to the point that the
time at which you consider what just compensation is,
is in the just compensation proceedings.
And while I misspoke about what the test
was, and I apologize for that, certainly this Court
can consider if social costs should be taken into
account at that time. I'm not saying they should. I
haven't thought that through as can you obviously see
by my misanswering the question, but it seems to me
because my primary answer is that you don't look at
that now.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, the tax
code does have special provisions for involuntary
sales and reinvestments.
MR. HORTON: Yes, it does.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The tax hypothetical is
not accurate.
MR. HORTON: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Horton, I'm not
proposing that the state has to use the property
itself. I'm simply proposing that its use not be a
private use which has incidental benefits to the
state. That is not enough to justify use of the
condemnation power.
MR. HORTON: Well, I don't think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You can give it to a
private entity, you can give it to a railroad, to
some public utility. But the use that it's put to by
that railroad and public utility is a public use.
That's why it's a public utility.
It's quite different to say you can give
it to a private individual simply because that
private individual is going to hire more people and
pay more taxes. That, it seems to me, just washes
out entirely the distinction between private use and
public use.
MR. HORTON: Well, I don't agree, Your
Honor, because I think, you know, I think if a person
is without a job and if a person is not able to get
basic services that they need from the town because
the town can't afford it, that's just as important as
a trains running on time or eliminating blight.
And Justice Breyer, I thought of another
answer to your question that has to do with this
case. And that is even on a higher test, we win
because the Connecticut Supreme Court applied a
higher test in this case.
And just -- I would say that in this case,
the essence of federalism is to let various courts
make various decisions about what they consider an
important public purpose. It may be different in
Utah from the way it is in Connecticut, and it's
different in Florida, and I don't think this Court
should be having a new jurisprudence for this area
and having two separate tests, and maybe having a
test that even approaches the Nollan Dolan test where
you certainly want to discourage people from taking
these actions.
And so it seems to me the four words I
think that this Court should consider -- and I'm not
going to tell you the four words since my red light
is on. Thank you, Your Honor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Bullock, you have
three and a half minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY SCOTT G. BULLOCK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Bullock, do you know
those four words?
MR. BULLOCK: I wish I did. I could
respond to it if I -- if I actually did. Your
Honors, first of all, just a couple of matters
regarding the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision.
The Connecticut Supreme Court did not apply the test
that we suggest in our case, they explicitly, the
majority explicitly declined to apply heightened
scrutiny in this, in this instance.
I think the key to understanding their
argument is the answer to the question of, can you
take a Motel 6 and give it to a fancier hotel? Their
answer is yes. And that's what's really at stake
here.
These condemnations are taking place
throughout the country. A city in California
condemns the 99 cents store in order to give it to
Costco. Now, were they giving enormous benefits to
Costco? Of course they were. But they did so
because they wanted to get the tax revenue, and
that's the problem with these types of condemnations,
the desire to help a private party and the desire to
help the public are really one and the same. The
public only benefits if the private party is
successful.
The NLDC is a private body. It has a
private board of directors, and it is leasing land to
a private developer for 99 years at $1 a year. That
is private ownership of land.
Also, Your Honors, there is no severe
assembly problem in this particular case, and in many
other development situations. The NLDC and the city
have 32 acres that was given to them by the Federal
Government for them to do as they wish. And our
homeowners who have lived there a long time and wish
to hold on to their properties do not object to that
development going on. It is within the rights of the
city and the NLDC to do so.
Also, Your Honor, the Rindge case that was
cited by the Respondents, they actually knew what was
going to go on in that, in that case. They knew what
the use was going to be.
And finally, Your Honors, the Respondents
talk about the effect that this may have upon poor
people. Not all neighborhoods, not all poor
neighborhoods are blighted. But the one thing that
all poor neighborhoods share in common is that they
don't produce much in the way of tax revenue, so
you're going to put poor neighborhoods and working
class neighborhoods like the ones that exist in Fort
