CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 12-158,
Bond v. United States.
Mr. Clement?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
If the statute at issue here really does
reach every malicious use of chemicals anywhere in the
nation, as the government insists, then it clearly
exceeds Congress' limited and enumerated powers.  This
Court's cases have made clear that it is a bedrock
principle of our federalist system that Congress lacks a
general police power to criminalize conduct without
regard to a jurisdictional element or some nexus to a
matter of distinctly Federal concern.
The President's negotiation and the Senate's
ratification of a treaty with a foreign nation does not
change that bedrock principle of our constitutional
system.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, Mr. Clement, you
said that -- that the treaty is valid and the
implementing legislation seems to largely copy the words
of the treaty without adding anything.  So it's a puzzle
that the treaty could be constitutional, but the
implementing legislation that adds nothing is
unconstitutional.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I
guess I would quarrel with your premise, which is, it is
true that the convention in the statute used similar
terms and terminology, but there's one very important
difference between the convention and the statute, and
that actually differentiates this case from Missouri v.
Holland.
And that difference is that the convention
itself doesn't directly regulate individual conduct at
all.  And so all the -- all the convention does --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the convention -- but
the convention tells the State parties, go regulate
individual conduct in exactly the way that this
convention regulates State parties.  And then what the
legislation does is, as Justice Ginsburg said, just
mirror the convention as the convention contemplated.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, to be
quite precise, though, what the convention says -- and
this is Article 7, Section 1, it's 33a of the Blue Brief
appendix.  What it says is that each nation state that
signs the convention agrees, in accordance with its
constitutional processes, to pass penal laws that make
unlawful for individuals conduct that would violate the
convention, if undertaken by a nation state.
And I would respectfully suggest that making
that translation, if you will, between what violates the
convention if you're a nation state and what would be
comparable individual conduct is not obvious.  And when
the government does that through penal legislation,
there's no reason why that penal legislation shouldn't
have to comply --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why not?
MR. CLEMENT:  -- as we promised with our --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Clement, why not?
Meaning there -- there can be no doubt that chemical
weaponry is at the forefront of our foreign policy
efforts right now.  Look at the Syria situation alone.
It would be deeply ironic that we have expended so much
energy criticizing Syria, when if this Court were now to
declare that our joining or creating legislation to
implement the treaty was unconstitutional.  We're
putting aside the impact that we could have on foreign
relations.
Why is it -- if it's okay to regulate the
possession of marijuana, a purely local crime, why is it
unconstitutional to regulate the use of something that
can kill or maim another human being -- a chemical that
can kill or maim another human being?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't understand where
the disconnect is in terms of our Federal or State
system.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, I
think it really gets down to the difference between
Raich on the one hand and Lopez on the other, which, as
this Court has held, that it is a classic and rational
way to regulate commerce, to basically prohibit certain
items from commerce.  And --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't this
saying -- there's no dispute that these chemicals were
transported against -- along interstate lines.  That's
not even disputed in this case.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well -- but I don't think it
was really disputed in Lopez that the firearm would have
had to cross State lines.  But the problem in Lopez was
the Federal statute was not structured in a way that had
a jurisdictional nexus that made the statute only
applicable as a regulation.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we didn't take this
case to -- to decide the Commerce Clause question, did
we?  The government didn't even assert it below.  It
asserts it now, but as we took the case, the issue was
whether the treaty supported the -- the laws.
MR. CLEMENT:  That's right, Justice Scalia.
And we do think that the government, like a private
party, can waive a constitutional argument.
On the other hand, I would say that we're
not particularly concerned about the Commerce Clause
argument because we think the Commerce Clause argument
has the same basic defect as the treaty power argument,
which is that the police --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think -- do you
think, Mr. Clement, and this goes back to Justice
Ginsburg's question, could the -- could this treaty have
itself regulated individual conduct?  Could the treaty
have been self-executing?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think that's an
interesting question, and I don't think the Court needs
to answer it.  I mean, I would take the position that if
there really were a self-executing treaty that tried to
impose criminal prohibitions, and I don't think there is
any treaty like that, but if there were one, I would
say, here, that it violates the Constitution for the
same basic reasons that this implementing legislation
does.  But I -- but I --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So where would you find that
in the Constitution?  Because there's clearly a treaty
power that does not have subject matter limitations.
And, indeed, if you go back to the founding history,
it's very clear that they thought about all kinds of
subject matter limitations, and James Madison and others
decided, quite self-consciously, not to impose them.
So where would you find that limitation in
the Constitution.
MR. CLEMENT:  I would find that limitation
in the structural provisions of the Constitution and the
enumerated powers of Congress.  And I would say that it
would be very --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this is an enumerated
power.  The enumerated power is the treaty power.  So
you have to find a constraint on the treaty power.
Where does it come from?
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think  that where it
would come from, again, is the structural provisions of
the Constitution.  If we had a self-executing treaty
that purported, at a national level, to commandeer State
and local police officers, I would think that there
might be -- you could call it a Tenth Amendment
objection, you could call it an enumerated power
objection.  There might be an objection to that treaty.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, don't you think the
word "treaty" has some meaning?  It is certainly true
that, going back to the beginning of the country, there
have been many treaties that have been implemented in
ways that affect matters that otherwise would be within
the province of the States.
One of the original purposes of the--
objectives of the Constitution was to deal with -- with
a treaty power was to deal with the issue of debts owed
to British creditors.  And there have been cases about
the property rights of -- of foreign subjects, about the
treatment of foreign subjects here, about things that
are moving across international borders, about
extradition and all of those.
But in all of those, until fairly recently,
certainly until, generally, after World War II, all of
those concerned matters that are of legitimate concern
of a foreign State.  That was the purpose of a treaty.
So can't we see something in that, in the meaning of a
treaty, what it was understood to mean when the
Constitution was adopted?
MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's right,
Justice Alito.  And I didn't mean, in answering Justice
Kagan's question, to fully accept the premise that
there's no limit on the treaty power whatsoever.  But I
do think that it's important to recognize that, in the
context of non-self-executing treaties, there's a real
opportunity to leave for another day the question of
whether the treaty itself is valid because, sometimes, a
treaty is non-self-executing precisely because the
Senate recognizes --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you had been the
President's counsel, would you have advised him that it
was unconstitutional to sign this treaty as written?
MR. CLEMENT:  No.  Absolutely not,
Justice Kennedy, but that's precisely because it's a
valid non-self-executing treaty.  By its terms, it
doesn't do anything to direct -- directly regulate
individual conduct.  And if I were the President's
counsel, I would have said, honestly, Mr. President, I
don't think this requires us to have any law that
applies to garden variety assaults with chemicals.
But if we need that to discharge our treaty
obligations, the States are absolutely ready and able to
shoulder that task.  There's no State in this country
that doesn't have a general assault statute that would
be covered by this conduct.  There is no State that
doesn't have a murder statute to cover this conduct --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Clement, there's an
irony in what you just said, because the victim, many
times, went to the State police and said, please help
me.  And they turned her away a dozen times.  And
finally they said, go to the post office.
So this doesn't seem to be -- you're arguing
that this trenches on the State's domain.  And, yet, in
this very case, it wasn't until the State referred her
to the post office, Federal officials, that she got any
action.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, one
way to understand that is that the State of Pennsylvania
exercised its prosecutorial discretion not to pursue
this matter.  I don't think that -- I don't even think
the government says that that exercise of prosecutorial
discretion put us in violation of our treaty
obligations.
Our treaty obligation, at most, is to have a
law that prohibits this conduct, which the States
certainly do.  The treaty obligation is not to make sure
that every single use -- malicious use of chemicals is,
in fact, prosecuted by the State or local officials.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement, could I make
sure I understand your test?  Your test is to say that
with respect to every prosecution under this -- under
this treaty, that a court has to ask whether the
prosecution has a sufficient nexus to national or
international concerns?  Is that -- is that your test?
MR. CLEMENT:  No, that's not my test,
Justice Kagan.  I would actually come at it from the
other end of the stick, which is to say, that the one
thing I think I know from this Court's precedence is
that the Federal government doesn't have a general
police power.
So as I look at this statute, it can either
be saved by essentially creating a jurisdictional
element out of the phrase "peaceful" and equating it
with non-war-like or, if the statute really has this
general character, then at least as applied to the
chemicals here, which are pure dual use chemicals, it
can't be constitutionally applied.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess I'm still
looking for a test, and I thought that the test that I
just articulated was really directly out of your briefs.
But if it's -- if -- if you're suggesting that
that's not the test, give me the test that we're
supposed to ask with respect to this case or any other
as to whether the prosecution is unconstitutional.
MR. CLEMENT:  It's whether the Federal
statute exercises a general police power.  And if it
does --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  That sounds like a facial
challenge.  Now, I thought that you made very careful to
talk about that this was an as-applied challenge to this
particular prosecution.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, that's because the only
relief I'm seeking is to have my client's conviction
vacated, so this is the classic as-applied challenge.
Now, the reasoning that the Court may employ in
vindicating my as-applied challenge may suggest that the
statute is unconstitutional in some or all of different
applications, but our claim has always been that
the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you're saying, if the
statute extends to things that we've generally thought
of as part of the police power, that's sufficient.
MR. CLEMENT:  I would say that, if a Federal
statute exercises the police power -- by which I mean it
criminalizes conduct without regard to jurisdictional
element or some nexus to a matter of distinctly Federal
concern, then that statute exceeds Congress' power.
That was the case in Lopez; that was the case in
Morrison.  And I think, unless you accept our narrowing
construction, that's the case here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Nexus -- nexus to a
national concern, again, is what I understood you to say
in your brief.  But let me give you a hypothetical, and
you tell me whether your test meets it.
Let's say it's the same convention, except
it relates only to Sarin gas, and -- and there's a
chemist out there and -- you know, the -- the
implementing legislation mirrors the convention.
There's a chemist out there who manufactures Sarin
gas -- I take it it's pretty easy to manufacture -- and
sends it through the ducts of a house and kills
everybody in it.
Does that have a nexus to national concerns?
MR. CLEMENT:  It does, Your Honor, and it
would be valid legislation precisely because Sarin is
something that, clearly, Congress could prohibit in all
its uses.  And as I understand how this statute applies
to Sarin gas or other things, certainly, on Schedule
I -- there are some Schedule I substances that are
talked about both in the convention and the treaty --
those things are always unlawful.
What is particularly unusual about the
statute's application to something like potassium
dichromate or vinegar or whatever you have is that, in
most of its possession and uses, it's perfectly lawful,
and what makes it a chemical weapon in the government's
theory is when it's used purely intrastate in a
malicious way.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So -- but this is -- in my
hypothetical -- and you didn't run away from it at all;
I applaud that.  In my hypothetical, it's a completely
domestic use -- you know, it's just this chemist didn't
like his neighbor and used Sarin gas.  And you're saying
that the difference is, well, what the treaty makers did
was define the category of chemicals more broadly.
And I guess what I want to know is you are
imagining a world in which judges day to day try to get
inside the head of treaty makers to think about -- you
know, in this case, we understand that there's a
national interest in regulating Sarin gas, but we don't
think that there's a sufficient national interest in regulating
some other chemical or some other chemical or so on down
the line.
It seems to me a completely indeterminate
test and one that would have judges take the place of
treaty makers, in terms of deciding what is in the
national and international interest.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, I would
beg to differ.  I actually think that our approach to
this case avoids judges being put in that difficult
position, precisely because we distinguish, unlike the
government, between the validity of the convention and
the validity of the implementing legislation.
And then, as to the implementing
legislation, we simply ask the courts to do what they do
in every other context, which is to check and see if
that implementing legislation is consistent with our
basic chartering document.
And it's the government's position, which I
don't really understand why this would work, but their
theory is that, if the non-self-executing treaty is
valid, then the implementing legislation is ipso facto
somehow valid.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And do you think it would be
difficult --
MR. CLEMENT:  And think about the convention
that was before this Court in the Medellin case, the
Vienna Convention on Consular Notification.  It puts an
obligation on any arresting official to provide
notification to the consulate about an arrested foreign
national.
Now, I suppose it would be a perfectly
rational way to implement that convention to have a
national police force, and so every arresting officer is
a Federal officer who's fully apprised of the Vienna
Convention responsibilities.  That would be a rational
way to implement the treaty, but it wouldn't be remotely
consistent with our Constitution.
On the other hand, that same valid
non-self-executing treaty can be validly implemented by
chartering the State Department to work with police
officers on a State and local level to understand their
obligations.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think it would be
difficult for a judge to ask, is there any possibility
that there is any other country in the world that has
the slightest interest in how the United States or any
of its subdivisions deals with the particular situation
that's involved in this case?
MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Alito, I think that
would be one way of approaching the question.  I think
that would be a --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that would be
beyond the -- that would be beyond the ability of
Federal judges when they -- when a case like this comes
before them?
MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think it would be
beyond their ability.  I also don't think it would be
beyond -- beyond the ability of a Federal judge to say,
okay, let's hypothetically ask the question in the
absence of a non-self-executing treaty, would Congress
have the power to pass this statute?
And if the answer to that is no, then I
think the burden sort of shifts to figure out why it is
that the treaty adds something to the powers of the
Federal government.
And I think this, just to make clear, I
think this is a very different context from what the
Court had in Missouri v. Holland because, there, the
treaty itself prohibited individual action.  An
individual violated the treaty if they took a migratory
bird out of season.
And so in that sense, the enforcement
statute did nothing more than put a criminal penalty on
violating conduct that was already prohibited to the
individual.  And in that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it -- is it one way to
characterize your argument or is it too unfairly
confining to your argument to say that what you're
suggesting is something like a clear statement rule,
that, if the treaty intends nation states to have their
own constitutional structure superseded at a minimum, it
has to say so, and then we will come to the question of
whether or not they can do it?
MR. CLEMENT:  I think that would be a fair
characterization of our argument, but only to add that
this would be the anti-clear statement case.  Because
the one place that this convention talks about imposing
obligations on individuals, it's a promise by the nation
state to pass penal legislation that is in accordance
with their constitutional systems.
So it's very bizarre -- that's Article VII,
Section 1, it's, I think, 33a.  And so it's very bizarre
when the only way we're reaching individual conduct
here, unlike the treaty in Holland, is a United States
promise to pass legislation that comports with our
constitutional process, to say that the convention,
therefore, allow us to pass legislation that doesn't
comport with our constitutional process.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Clement, I -- I don't
understand how -- how you distinguish Sarin gas.  Why is
Sarin gas different from vinegar?
MR. CLEMENT:  Because Sarin gas is, I think,
more equivalent to something that the Congress would try
to deal with like the way it dealt with marijuana in
Raich.  I think -- it's just a reflection of the idea
that, when you're talking about things where the Federal
Government is trying to prohibit it, then there's a
greater Federal power to do that.
And I think, with Sarin gas, you could
imagine -- put aside the commerce power for a second,
put aside the treaty power -- it may be that, with Sarin
gas, even under the war powers, the Federal Congress can
say, look, that's something that's -- you know, it's
sort of inherently a chemical weapon, and we're going to
prohibit people from having that.
That's very different from these situations
where, if you think about it, the only thing that makes
these chemicals chemical weapons instead of chemicals is
their internal, intrastate use in a malicious way.  And
that's different, I think, from at least a hypothetical
statute that says, look, here are -- I mean, there's
three schedules in the statute, 43 different chemicals
that are particularly problematic.
If the Federal government wants to regulate
those and prohibit the unauthorized possession of those,
I don't see why they couldn't do that with or without
the treaty.  But when -- what is so anomalous here is
the idea that these chemicals, everything, rat poison,
vinegar, whatever it is, these things are perfectly
lawful, we don't think of them as chemical weapons,
unless and until they're used in a malicious way, and
then all of a sudden, they become classified as chemical
weapons.
That's a very odd statute.  But it does, I
think, operate in a way that is just inconsistent with
the bedrock principle that the Federal Congress just
doesn't have this kind of police power.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is the chemical used here
one of the chemicals that's listed in the annex to the
treaty?
MR. CLEMENT:  I don't believe so.  It's
certainly not one that is listed on the three schedules.
There are 43 chemicals.  Neither of these are on there.
And I do think there is an important difference
because -- this is perhaps an odd way to think about it,
but -- you know, this is a statute that's really trying
to regulate nouns, chemical weapons.  And with respect
to something like weaponized chemicals or Sarin gas, it
makes sense to say those are chemical weapons.
But with respect to otherwise harmless
chemicals, the only thing that under the government's
theory turns them from chemical weapons -- I'm sorry --
from chemicals into chemical weapons isn't a noun, it's
a verb.  It's their malicious use.  And that puts you in
a very odd sort of situation.
And I think that -- you know, if Congress
had come in and said, look, there are certain chemicals
that, by their very nature, are almost inherently
weaponized, I think Congress would have a lot more
authority to proceed in that kind of situation.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel -- counsel, we
permit that in all sorts of definitional sections of the
criminal code.  We call a dangerous weapon anything that
you use to inflict serious injury on someone.  I don't
think of a car as, necessarily, a dangerous weapon.  It
is something I use to transport myself.
It's only when I'm using it for a prohibited
purpose that it turns itself into a dangerous weapon.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I'm -- I'm having a
problem with this noun-verb distinction.  Why isn't the
intentional burning, killing of another human being
using chemicals the essence of what this treaty is
trying to stop?  I thought that's what it was trying to
do.
MR. CLEMENT:  A couple points --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You want to add on the
war-like purposes, but the -- the treaty permits
exceptions for any peaceful purpose.
MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Sotomayor, a couple of
points.  First of all, generally, you might be right
that -- that the criminal law takes objects that are
otherwise innocent and say -- say they can be used in a
malicious way and criminalizes it.
But most of that work is done by State and
local criminal law, and at the Federal level, you need
something else.  You need a jurisdictional element,
something that has a distinct Federal concern.
Second, as to the concerns about this
convention --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The treaty power.
MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I don't think that the
treaty power --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what was said in
the --
MR. CLEMENT:  -- especially when there's
this much of a disconnect between what the treaty power
does and what the statute does, which is the treaty,
again, does not directly regulate at all individual
conduct.  It is regulated at nation state conduct.
Now, with all due respect, I don't think
that nation states poison romantic rivals, attempt to
commit suicide, or try to get rodents out of their
houses.  And so, when individuals do those things, I
think it's -- it's hard to draw an analogy between
what's forbidden to a nation state and the individual
action.
But any work that is done in the statute by
drawing that analogy is done by the statute and not by
the convention.  So I don't --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if a terrorist took
these chemicals and put it on every doorknob in Boston,
that wouldn't be regulated by this or -- the very exact
same chemicals.
MR. CLEMENT:  Right.  And we would say that,
under our narrowing construction, that that's covered.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because it's war-like.
MR. CLEMENT:  Because it's a war-like use of
the chemicals.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Now, we
have -- we have --
MR. CLEMENT:  We would also point out for
the record that that same conduct would obviously be
covered directly by Federal statutes that target
terrorism directly.  So no matter how you decide that
case, whether you accept our narrowing -- if you accept
our narrowing construction, that conduct will be covered
by two Federal statutes.  If you don't accept our
narrowing construction, but hold this statute
unconstitutional, then that conduct is still going to be
covered.
And I just think, when you are trying again
to think about what the convention is after, it is not
really after Ms. Bond's conduct.  I don't think any one
of our treaty partners said, oh, my goodness, there's
been a deployment of chemical weapons in Norristown,
Pennsylvania; I sure hope the United States steps up to
its treaty obligations and prosecutes this horrible
deployment of chemical weapons.
Nobody would say that because nobody
speaking normal English would identify this as a
deployment of chemical weapons at all.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but, Mr. Clement, it's
absolutely clear that the treaty was after enforcement
as to individuals with respect to all the prohibitions,
that the treaty said, go enforce this as to individuals
and do it consistent with your constitutional processes.
And then Congress passes a law that is
consistent with its constitutional processes, and it
completely mirrors the treaty.
MR. CLEMENT:  Two things, Justice Kagan,
neither of which will surprise you, I suppose.  One is I
don't think this is consistent with our constitutional
processes --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm still trying to
figure out why.  I mean, Holmes dealt with this in
Missouri v. Holland.  He says there's a treaty power,
it's an enumerated power, there's a Necessary and Proper
Clause that functions to -- to allow Congress to give
effect to that treaty power.  It's -- you know, this is
a -- a situation where there's a prohibition on the
States in terms of entering into treaties or in terms of
sharing that power in any way.
And he says -- you know, it's just these
invisible radiations that you think come from the
structure of the Constitution.  And he specifically
rejected this argument, the same argument that you're
making, the penumbras and emanations of the
Constitution.
MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Kagan, I think you
have to read Missouri v. Holland both in the context of
the treaty that the Court had before it and the argument
that it had before it.  Missouri made a very strange
argument in Missouri v. Holland, one that no modern
litigant would make.  They made an argument that -- they
went out of their way to identify a conflict between the
Federal treaty and State law and said, therefore, we win
under the Supremacy Clause.
And Holmes scratched his head and said no.
The treaty under -- under Article 6 is supreme to both
State law and not the other way around.  But he also
said this one sentence that sort of bedeviled the lower
courts here, which says, well, and if the treaty's
valid, of course, the legislation is valid.
That made sense in the context of the treaty
he had before him because he had a treaty that directly
prohibited individual conduct and a statute that
enforced that individualized prohibition with criminal
penalties.
So in that case, I suppose it was right,
that the treaty and the implementing legislation stood
or fell together.  That's not the case here.
If I could reserve my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
General Verrilli.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
The framers gave the Federal Government
exclusive control over the treaty function to ensure
that it could knit the nation together as one and allow
it to be fully sovereign in the conduct of foreign
affairs.
Petitioner's ad hoc "too local" limit on the
treaty power can't be squared with a judgment the
framers made, this Court's precedent, or consistent
historical practice since the time of the founding, and
it would compromise foreign affairs and national
security interests of the first order.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General, let's
suppose there's a multilateral treaty, the -- the
international convention to ensure that national
legislatures have full authority to carry out their
obligations, i.e., that the national legislature has the
police power.
And Congress passes a statute saying we have
the authority to prosecute purely local crimes pursuant
to this international convention that the President has
signed.  Any problem with that?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  There may well be.  Let
me walk through the analysis that I think you'd have to
go through.  First, I would make the point,
Mr. Chief Justice, that it seems unimaginable that a
convention of that kind would be ratified by two-thirds
of the Senate, which it would have to be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It also seems
unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution.  But
let's leave that.
(Laughter.)
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And that does go to the
point --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And just to press it
further, the -- the point is that it's a transfer of
authority from the States to the national legislature.
I don't know why you'd look to the national legislature
to say, well, we'd never do that.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, the framers thought
that the two-thirds guarantee -- the two-thirds
ratification requirement, was an important structural
guarantee to protect the interests of the States.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  At a time when the
Senate was elected by the State legislatures.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
But there's no doubt that the framers thought that would
be an important protection.
But beyond that, this Court has said that --
that there is an inquiry.  It said in dictum.  It has
never held that a ratified treaty exceeds -- exceeds the
Federal government's constitutional authority.  It's
never held that a provision implementing a ratified
treaty exceeds the Federal government's constitutional
authority.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So your answer is if -- if
that unimaginable thing should happen, it would be okay?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  My answer is this:  That
the Court has said that there is an inquiry into whether
the -- it is a proper subject of a treaty and that that
inquiry could take into account whether it is imposing a
fundamental change in the character of the government.
But that's not a question the Court needs to
answer here because this treaty, the -- the Petitioner
concedes, is a valid exercise of the treaty power, and
the legislation implementing this treaty is coextensive
with the obligations of the treaty.  There is no --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I don't know
why it would not be a valid exercise of the treaty
power.  A case like Medellin caused serious conflict
with our international obligations because we held,
look, the Federal government does not have the authority
to tell the sheriff in Texas what to do.  That caused a
great deal of strain in -- in our international
relations.
And I think the United Nations could well
say, look, we don't want treaty parties to have to deal
with whether it's somebody in this State or somebody in
that province who has the authority, so every signatory
must have the authority.  It doesn't strike me as not
reasonably related to international obligations.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  All right.  But -- but
here, Mr. Chief Justice, this is a valid exercise of the
treaty power, and there is no daylight between the
implementing legislation and the obligations that the
Petitioner concedes are valid.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  I know
your -- I know the case --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And therefore -- and
therefore, that may be a question that the Court would
have to answer in a different case.  But this case
doesn't present the opportunity to answer that question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the -- the
purpose of my hypothetical was try to find out if
there's any situation in which you believe an erosion or
intrusion by the Federal government on the police power
could be a constraint against an international treaty.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  There -- there may be an
outer bound, but this case is nowhere close to it.
And -- and it isn't -- it can't be a "too local"
exception to the treaty power, which Petitioners argue.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it seems to me
that if you say there may be an outer bound, but this
case isn't one of them, you're subjecting yourself to
the same criticisms that have been leveled against the
other side, that you're proposing a case-by-case
evaluation with respect to each treaty.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  I think, Your Honor,
that the question here is whether this legislation
validly -- it validly implements a valid treaty.
The treaty is concededly valid.  The
legislation is concededly valid on its face.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'd like to -- I'd like to
explore that, your proposition that there's no daylight
between the treaty itself and the implementing
legislation.
It seems to me there -- there's a lot of
daylight between the two.  Let's take -- and I pick this
example, not because it's controversial, but because it
relates to an area where the Federal government has
never been thought to have authority, namely family law.
There are no -- you know, Federal marriage,
Federal divorce, Federal adoption.  It's all been State
law.  Let's assume that an international treaty is
approved by two-thirds of the Senate and the president
which requires States to -- to approve same-sex
marriage.  All right?
Now, if -- if that were a self-executing
treaty, same-sex marriage would have to be approved by
every State.  If it is not self-executing, however, it
will be up to Congress to produce that result, and
Congress would do it or could do it at least by having a
Federal marriage law.  And then you would have to have a
Federal divorce law and, I suppose, a Federal adoption
law.
I think there is a big difference between
just doing it through a self-executing treaty and
dragging the Congress into -- into areas where it has
never been before.
I think there is daylight between the treaty
and requiring the treaty to be implemented in the
fashion that -- that you assert is necessary here.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Your Honor, I'd like to
make a structural point and then a specific point about
this case.  The structural point, Justice Scalia, is
this:  If it is the case, as -- as Your Honor's
hypothetical seems to concede and as I believe
Petitioner concedes, that a self-executing treaty that
requires the President to negotiate and two-thirds of
the Senate to ratify it, can impose an obligation of
that kind, then it has to be the case that a
non-self-executing treaty that is -- that has the same
approval of the President, the same two-thirds
ratification, and the additional structural protection
of passage of legislation by the Senate and the House
and being signed into law by the President, can do what
the self-executing treaty can do.  It has to be the
case.
The power, if the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think it has to be
the case.  I think there -- there's a great difference
between requiring the states, by a self-executing
treaty, to permit same-sex marriage and dragging the
Federal government or allowing the Federal government to
enter into this whole field of marriage, divorce,
adoption, family law, where the Federal government has
never been.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, with respect --
now, the point, with respect to this treaty, I don't
think that, with all due respect, there is any daylight
here with respect to this treaty.
Section 229(a) does precisely what the
treaty obligates the United States government to do, and
I think the notion that the treaty obligation can be
satisfied by relying on the States to enforce their
assault laws, which I think is the core of my friend's
argument here, is directly contrary to the history of
the framing --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It is?  It is?  It is?
That's the part that I can't yet get my mind to these
dramatic questions of whether, here, the local police
power or, in some other case, some other inherently
State power make a treaty beyond the power of the
Federal government to enter into.  It's a very big
question.
But I'm not there yet.  And the reason I'm
not there is because there's some words in this treaty
called "other peaceful purpose," and we have to
interpret those words, and the same words are in the
statute.
And my question to you is:  What reason is
there to think that those matters on List A fall within
those words?  What is List A?  It's infinitely long.  A
few things on it are in Holmes' opinion in Peasley, a
great case on attempted murder where he talks about
paying a small boy to move a barrel of kerosene with a
candle in it alit, so that it will burn down a barn
after a few hours.  The kerosene is a chemical.
He talks about a case where a person went to
a racetrack and gave a horse a poison potato.
He talks about a case involving somebody
else trying to light a match, which is a chemical, and
setting fire to a haystack.
We can all think, sadly, of athletes, Lance
Armstrong, at least accused of unlawfully taking drugs.
I mean, why do we think matters of List A fall within
those words, outside the words "other peaceful purpose,"
even though they're unlawful?
And by the way, did anyone say to the
drafters of the convention -- I found nothing in this
brief on the point -- or did anyone tell Congress that
poison potatoes, drug-enhancing -- performance-enhancing
drugs, the example that Justice Alito used last time,
you give vinegar to a goldfish -- I mean, these are all
chemicals not in the annex, but they are chemicals.
And they are absolutely nothing to do with
chemical weapons.  And why do we think that we have to
get beyond that fact?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  This is a very important
point here, and it gets, I think, to the heart of what
the national interest is in this case with respect to
this treaty and this implementing legislation.  And the
harm inheres in the process of line drawing.
What the Petitioner is asking as a rule of
either constitutional law or statutory construction is
that courts, on a case-by-case basis, after the fact
make ad hoc judgments about whether they --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  There's an easy
way out of that.  All we do is say the chemicals
involved are the chemicals in the annex.  But you're not
prepared to say that, I guarantee it.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No -- no, I'm not.  I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, we're outside
the annex.  And I guess once we get outside the annex,
we either have to draw lines or we have to say, well,
this encompasses the poison potato, the poisoned
goldfish, the small boy with the candle, the -- for
performance-enhancing drugs.
I would say judges are here to draw lines,
and between throwing all those things into it or drawing
lines, it's better to draw a few lines.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  We can -- we can talk
about hypotheticals, but the key point about them is
that they're hypothetical.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  These are real
cases, by the way.  The poison potato was in fact --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  The vinegar and the
goldfish is not a real case, and I would submit that de
minimis non curat lex --
JUSTICE ALITO:  They're not real -- they're
not real cases because you haven't prosecuted them yet.
If you told --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO:  If you told ordinary people
that you were going to prosecute Ms. Bond for using a
chemical weapon, they would be flabbergasted.  It's --
it -- it's so far outside of the ordinary meaning of the
word.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If her child had died --
excuse me.
JUSTICE ALITO:  This statute has an
enormous -- an enormous breadth, anything that can cause
death or injury to a person or an animal.
Would it shock you if I told you that a few
days ago, my wife and I distributed toxic chemicals to a
great number of children?
(Laughter.)
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Your Honor, I understand
the point.
JUSTICE ALITO:  On Halloween, we gave them
chocolate bars.  Chocolate is poison to dogs, so it's a
toxic chemical under the chemical weapons --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think de minimis non
curat lex would take care of that, but this -- there is
serious -- this is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  There's chocolate all over
the place.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do horses eat potatoes?  I
didn't know horses ate potatoes.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  With all due respect --
this is serious business.  With all due respect, the
line that the Petitioner is asking --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I'm not -- I want your
answer to the line -- my question was a question to get
your answer.  And the answer that I wanted you to
address yourself to is the problem of, once you depart
from the annexes in defining the chemicals, you throw
into it a list a thousand miles long.
And we can tell joke after joke, but it's
not a joke that it's so easy to make up examples that
seem to have nothing to do with the problem of chemical
weapons, like the Syrian problem, nothing to do with
that.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I understand that, Your
Honor, but the law --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So what is your answer?
That's what I want to know.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  If you will permit me to
answer the question this way:  The line that the
Petitioner is asking courts to draw is whether the
particular use is warlike or whether it constitutes a
peaceful purpose under this convention and under the
implementing statute.
Well, the very -- one of the very things we
are trying to sort out right now in Syria, under the
Chemical Weapons Convention, is where the line is
between peaceful uses and warlike uses.  And this phrase
"peaceful uses" is not only in the Chemical Weapons
Convention, it's in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,
and we're engaged in very sensitive negotiations right
now under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, trying to
draw exactly the same line.
And it would be terribly unfortunate, I
would submit, if the Court were to announce in the
context of this case, as Petitioner is asking, a
definition of what warlike constitutes that could have
an unfortunate bearing on those --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why don't you tell us --
can you tell us what the line is that we're trying to
draw?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  And the -- the -- the
framers of the convention and Congress in implementing
the convention made a judgment that there needs to be a
comprehensive ban and that you can't be drawing these
kinds of lines because you can't --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, General, could I ask
why that is?  I mean, because this -- this Convention
and the implementing legislation is very broad, and it's
broad because it applies to a very large category of
weapons and it applies to a very large category of
uses -- of conduct.
So what were they thinking about, about why
they wanted these very broad categories, why it's not
more limited with respect either to the chemicals or to
the conduct?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, with respect to the
chemicals, I think they made the judgment because you
can't predict in advance how chemicals are going to be
used and how toxic they will be in particular
combinations and how dangerous they will be in
particular combinations, and therefore, you need a
comprehensive definition.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, look, also, if you're
telling me -- I am attempting to draw the line, that's
just what I was going to do.
And if you're saying it's against the
national security interest, which is the first time I've
heard that, that it is the national interests -- against
the national interests of the United States for me to
attempt to draw such a line, then I guess the State
Department better file a brief explaining why or you
ought -- or why you -- why you want to push this case
or -- I mean, I'm -- is that what you're telling me,
that if I write the opinion that I think the law
requires me to write, that I somehow am hurting the
national security interests of the United States.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think there is
a -- I think there is a real risk in courts getting
involved in defining the line between warlike and
peaceful purposes --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You're the one --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- and the meaning of the
convention when the -- when the convention is purposely
drafted broadly.
And there -- there are additional risks in
terms of this -- the very act of bringing this process
of line-drawing to bear; case-by-case, ad hoc judgments
about what constitutes a violation and what doesn't is
going to undermine the ability of our negotiators
into -- to make treaties in the future because they
are --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you did not give the
line to the Chief Justice's question where there was a
treaty that intruded on the Federal structure.  You can
have a treaty where the President is required to set
aside any State law that, in his view, contravenes a
national interest.  That's a structure problem.
You've -- you've given us no -- no principle
the other way.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I -- what I think
it would, Justice Kennedy, would suffice to decide this
case, were the Court to conclude that the "too local"
limit that the Petitioner is advocating here as an
as-applied, case-by-case "too local" limit is not one
that is inconsistent with the constitutional structure
because, if you go back to the framers, it is clear from
the era of the framing that the framers intended to give
the national government the power using --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, is it your precept,
then, that a treaty cannot be inconsistent with our
constitutional structure?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  This Court has said that
the -- this Court has said that, in dictum, repeatedly,
but it has said that the -- the treaty -- there's a
question in a treaty power case of whether the subject
matter of the treaty is a proper subject for a treaty.
That's a question the Court can ask.  And --
and although I'm not prepared to draw a specific line
here today, there -- there may well be a line to be
drawn.  But here, the Petitioner has conceded, and I
think all of us would agree, this is the proper subject
of the treaty.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But there are a lot
of treaties, particularly I think Justice Alito pointed
out, after the World War II era, where you have
international conventions affecting everything.  We have
international conventions on the abduction of children,
international conventions that -- human rights.  They
cover a vast swathe of -- of subject matter.
And it seems to me the only thing you're
saying that is a limit on what the treaty power can be
as a source for is some determination, no more --
less -- no less arbitrary than the lines other people
are asking us to draw between what's appropriate under
the treaty power and what's not.
And I just would like a fairly precise
answer whether there are or are not limitations on what
Congress can do with respect to the police power.  If
their authority is asserted under a treaty, is their --
is their power to intrude upon the police power
unlimited?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  If the -- if the
treaty -- well, the way I would answer that,
Mr. Chief Justice, is if the treaty is valid --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  The treaty is
valid.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Then implementing
legislation that doesn't go beyond the treaty is valid
even if it addresses a subject that would otherwise be
within the police power of the States.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That was the judgment the
framers made, and that's what -- that's this case.  And
so -- and because the treaty is valid, the Petitioner's
concede that the treaty is valid, this statute
implements the treaty -- word-for-word implementation of
the obligations that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you would rather
have the Court determine, if we're concerned about the
intrusion on the police power, whether treaties are
valid or not than whether -- determine whether
particular implementing legislation is valid or not.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  I think, Your Honor,
that because it is conceded in this case that the treaty
is valid, and the Petitioner hasn't elaborated any
argument that -- or any principle that would allow this
Court to make a judgment about when an exercise of the
treaty power is valid and when it isn't, that you've got
to take, as a given in this case, that the treaty is
valid --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know this case.
The point of the hypothetical is I'm trying to get your
general principle.  I can imagine treaties that you
would say are within the treaty power, again,
particularly in the post-World War II era, but that
could give rise to implementing legislation that I think
would be extraordinary from the point of view of the
framers and the power that it gave Congress to intrude
upon State authority.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  So there is a structure
of limitations -- you know, as I said earlier.  The
two-thirds ratification requirement is real with respect
to this.  One of the treaties Your Honor just referred
to, the U.N. Convention on Civil and Political Rights,
of course, when the Senate ratified it, it did use its
power to make reservations to preserve our Federal
system.
So that operated in exactly the manner that
the framers intended there to protect, to safeguard the
interests of federalism.  And there are -- you know,
there are about 1,000 ratified treaties on the books
right now, and we don't have the Congress using the
treaty power to -- to usurp the role of the States --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, no.  That isn't the
problem.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's -- it's kind of
question begging.  I mean, the whole point is that some
people think we do have exactly that in this case.  Now,
usually, when we have a case that implicates significant
and serious bilateral concerns, we get a lot of briefs
and all that from our -- our treaty partners.
Is -- is there any concern that's been
expressed in any concrete way by them about whether
Mrs. Bond is prosecuted?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I doubt that, Your Honor,
because --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  Yes.  So
nothing in --
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Nobody -- no -- nobody
would -- we're not saying -- and I don't think anybody
would say that -- that whether or not Ms. Bond is
prosecuted would give rise to an international incident.
The question is whether Congress has the authority to
pass a comprehensive ban.
Now, there may, of course, be applications
of that comprehensive ban that don't advance the
national interest in a profound or poignant way; we
understand that.  But the question is whether Congress
can pass a comprehensive ban implementing a treaty.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That is the question --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, General, don't we have
an amicus brief from almost all of the legal counsels of
the State Department, Republican and Democrat, talking
about how, if Petitioner's argument were accepted, it
would severely damage the United States' ability to
enter into and to negotiate treaties?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's right.  And
that -- and that's true, it's -- and that's certainly
true.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sure that the
people who've worked in the national branch of
government, particularly for the State Department, would
like to have as much authority as they can get to
negotiate treaties.  We're concerned about limitations
on other.
Do we have any briefs from State
legislatures, State authorities, concerning intrusion on
their prerogatives?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Your Honor, this
convention is a convention that all, but four nations on
Earth, have signed.  The legislation that we have
enacted is a model legislation that over 120 other
nations have enacted as well.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Whenever -- when this Court
has issued decisions in recent years holding that there
are some limits on Congress' power, cases like Lopez and
Morrison and City of Boerne, there have been legal
commentators who have written articles saying that could
be circumvented to -- through the use of the treaty
power.  Do you agree with that?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't think there's a
yes-or-no answer to that.  I think that -- because I
don't think it would be -- the question would be:  What
does the treaty power encompass?  It wouldn't be a
circumvention if this is something that could be
constitutionally done under the treaty power, but --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you -- all right.
I'll take back the word "circumvention."  Could you
reach the opposite result?  Could it -- could Congress
regulate the possession of a gun within a school zone by
entering into a treaty that authorizes such legislation?
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think the question in
that case would be whether the treaty is a valid
exercise of the treaty power.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, but it is.  That is the
problem.  There is an underlying -- I don't mean to cut
you off, but at some point, you seem not to see a
problem that I think I see.
And the problem underlying it, if you get
into the treaty area, is this:  Given the power, as
there is in Medellin's majority, to have some
self-executing treaties, in principle, your position
constitutionally would allow the President and the
Senate, not the House, to do anything through a treaty
that is not specifically within the prohibitions of the
rights protections of the Constitution.
That's Missouri v. Holland.  And I doubt
that, in that document, the Framers intended to allow
the President and the Senate to do anything.
Now, you ask us, now, to say whether the
answer to that question is yes or no.  We still have a
democracy, in other words, of which the House is part.
Now, if you carry it to an extreme, that's what you
are -- that's where you are, and I am worried about
that, and I think others are, too.
So I had asked you, isn't there an easier
way to deal with this case?  And you tell me, no, no,
because it will interfere with some problem of foreign
affairs that was never mentioned in any brief -- or at
least hit me for the first time when you said it.
Now, there, you have an expression of my
uncertainties at the moment, and any way you want to
reply to that would be helpful.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  I understand the point,
Justice Breyer, I do.  I understand that there is
something that seemed attractive in trying think about
this as a question of statutory construction.  What I'm
trying to point out is that it's not as easy as it
seems, that there are real risks to trying to draw a
line of that kind.  And, yes, that does -- I understand
that.
That -- that does raise the stakes some, I
understand that.  But I think that risk is real, and I
think it -- that risk is real, the risk that the State
Department legal advisor's brief pointed out is real of
undermining our ability --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Verrilli, before
your time is out, you haven't answered directly why the
Bill of Rights does constrain the treaty power, the
implementation of it, Reid v. Colbert?
Why is the Bill of Rights different from the
federalism concern that the Court has expressed in many
cases, when you say, yes, there is a check, the Bill of
Rights is a check, but not the Tenth Amendment.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  There is a historical
answer to that question, Justice Ginsburg, which is that
that's how the framers understood it.  I think that's
clear from what Hamilton said in the -- in the quotes
that we have in our brief, and others of the Framers
understood that that's where the line would be.
And I think the reason for that is that the
treaty power is, itself, a great and substantial
independent power of the national government.  And it is
not constrained by a "too local" limitation.  That is
the lesson of the era of the framing, that there is a
not a "too local" limitation on the exercise of the
treaty power.
And, therefore, while --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, all of those quotes
pertain to self-executing treaties.  Yes, there is no
limitation on what -- what the President and the Senate
can impose as a self-executing requirement, namely, that
the States must give back to British citizens property
that they confiscated or whatever else.
But it's a different question whether a
treaty can expand the power of the Federal Congress into
areas that it has never been before.  That's a separate
question.  And neither Hamilton, nor any of the other
quotes that you refer to, address that question.
GENERAL VERRILLI:  Your Honor, so long as
the treaty -- it's a valid exercise of the treaty power,
I think a fortiori, if all you do is implement the
treaty in haec verba, it's a valid exercise of Congress'
power.
And I will say, I said, earlier, that this
is serious business.  I understand that principles of
federalism are serious business also, but federalism is
a two-way street.  And with respect to the exercise of
the treaty power, the framers made a judgment that --
that this power was going to be exclusively in the hands
of the national government.
And it needed to be exclusively in the hands
of the national government, in order to ensure that the
United States could be a full sovereign on the world
stage.
Now, it is true that the subject matter of
treaties is different now than it was at the time of the
founding, but the -- but the framers understood that.
They were careful not to impose subject matter
limitations on the treaty power because they were wise
enough to know they could not foresee what might be
important for the United States to be able to negotiate
about on a world stage in order to participate fully as
a sovereign.
That -- and the Chemical Weapons Convention
is a deeply apt illustration of exactly why the framers
were wise in ensuring that there were not subject matter
limitations on the exercise of the treaty power.
The Chemical Weapons Convention -- the
United States' leadership in the Chemical Weapons
Convention has made a big difference in ensuring that
this norm, which is in our national interests, our
foreign relations interests, and our national security
interest, is a norm that the -- that the nations of the
world have agreed to and that we are then in a position
to have leverage to insist that the nations of the world
abide by it.
It is leverage we are trying to exercise
right now.  It is critically important, and I
respectfully submit that the line that the Petitioner is
asking this Court to draw is not consistent with the
intent of the framers, with this Court's precedent or
with the national interests that I have described.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.
Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Just a few points in rebuttal.
First of all, the Senate's role in the
ratification of treaties cannot be a sufficient
political check, and one reason is that, sometimes, the
precise role they play as a check is to make a treaty
non-self-executing.
And so, to take Justice Scalia's
hypothetical example of an international treaty that
purported to regulate marriage rights, one thing that
the Senate very well might do in that case is to say,
well, we will ratify it, but we're going to make sure
it's non-self-executing, and maybe we will use our
spending power or something to get the States on board,
but we are not just going to impose a national solution.
So it doesn't make any sense to say that a
non-self-executing treaty necessarily, even if it's
valid, guarantees the validity of the enacting
legislation, because some of the reason that you make a
treaty non-self-executing is to preserve federalism.
A second point is to respond to the
argument, which I think I've already explained why it's
not correct, but it is the suggestion that there is no
daylight between the convention and the statute.  There
is huge daylight, and the daylight is precisely whether
it affects individual conduct and how it affects
individual conduct.
With all respect, everything on
Justice Breyer's List A is not stuff that I think
implicates the convention at all.  But, yet, under the
government's unwavering theory that you can't make any
limitations on the statute, that's all covered by the
statute.  There's your daylight.
Now, I would respectfully suggest that our
statutory construction argument is one way out of this.
I think that you have to understand the way that
"peaceful" is used in the statute is, essentially, a
term of art. I would analogize it to a situation where
two scientists in Antarctica get in a fistfight.
Okay.  That's not conduct we would condone,
but I don't think we've violated our pledge to reserve
Antarctica for only peaceful purposes.  And that's the
same way we would like you to interpret this statute.
Now, the government says you can't do that
because that's going to mess up what's going on in
Syria.  With all due respect, I assume that the issue in
Syria is whether or not the nation state of Syria is
doing something that would violate the convention if,
contrary to fact, they were signatory to this
convention.
So if you want to make clear that you're
only talking about individual conduct, I think you can
solve that whole problem right there.  But if I'm wrong
and the only way, as the government assures you that you
can make this legislation work is to have it be an
exercise of the police power, well, then the answer is
that the legislation is simply unconstitutional.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I just ask you,
Mr. Clement, and it's a variant of the hypothetical I
gave you before, but it focuses more on your statutory
point, the peaceful purposes.
Suppose that Ms. Bond used Sarin gas and
sent it through the ducts of Haynes' house; would you
say that that's a peaceful purpose?
MR. CLEMENT:  I would say it's not, but I
think it has to do more with the particular qualities of
Sarin gas, the fact that it's on Schedule A, the fact
that nobody can possess that for any lawful use.
And what makes something like vinegar or
even potassium dichromate different is what puts it over
the ledge from being an ordinary chemical to a chemical
weapon is precisely its use and its use alone.
Now, Justice Kagan, you asked a great
question.  What was Congress thinking when they did
this?  I think, with respect, the Congress wasn't
focused on this issue at all.
If you look at the legislation they passed
to implement this, the chemical industry and others put
in front of them the possibility that there was a Fourth
Amendment problem with the inspections of chemical
production facilities that were authorized under the
convention.  When Congress had the constitutional
problem in front of it, they had all sorts of provisions
to deal with that constitutional concern.
Now, the future Ms. Bonds of the world
didn't have quite the same lobbying resources as the
chemist -- the chemical industry, so they didn't avert
to this problem.  And that's precisely why some kind of
clear statement rule or the like would make perfect
sense in this, to make sure Congress doesn't exercise
the police power, when all it thinks it's doing is
implementing a treaty.
The last thing is just to say about the
State Department legal advisor's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  A clear statement
about -- about the treaty or -- I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
General.
