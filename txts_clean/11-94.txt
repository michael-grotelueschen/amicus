CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

States.
Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
In its landmark decision in Apprendi, this
Court announced as a fundamental principle of Fifth and
Sixth Amendment jurisprudence that every fact necessary
to increase the punishment beyond that which is
otherwise maximally provided for must be presented to
the jury and must be decided by the jury beyond a
reasonable doubt.
In this particular case, the defendant was
fined a total of an $18 million penalty in the context
of a jury finding that there was a single day of
violation under the RCRA provision. Congress is quite
explicit that the maximum fine for a single day's
violation is $50,000.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that jury trial
constitutionally required?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I believe the jury trial
was constitutionally required, Justice Scalia. The
cutoff between what's a petty offense not subject to
jury trial and what's beyond that -- I think you could
-- you could get there two ways. This is a crime that
Congress attaches a 5-year penalty to if it's against an
individual, which suggests that it is a very serious
crime. And the maximum fine under the district judge's
interpretation of this would have been $38 million, even
though the judge chose only to impose an $18 million
penalty under these circumstances. So, either way, it
seems to me clearly a serious offense.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What have we said is the
standard for fines?
MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What have we said with
reference to a jury trial when fines are involved? Does
it have to be a substantial fine or do we have a word
that we use?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you haven't used a word
-- I mean, the distinction is between a serious offense
and a petty offense, and the places where the -- you
know, you've drawn the line to conclude that a fine was
too small to be worried about was -- was $10,000 in the
Muniz case. You recognized in Bagwell that 52 million
was way beyond what would be appropriate under those
circumstances.
But I think the Court benefits most if it
just focuses on the potential penalties that Congress
has adopted and use that as the guidepost, because if
Congress has said that this is something for which
someone could be punished --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have to do that
because you have to know whether -- whether to impanel a
jury before the -- before the jury comes in or before
the jury comes in with a penalty, right?
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, absolutely. And we
asserted our right to a jury trial. The government
didn't contest our right to a jury trial. And I don't
actually read their brief --
JUSTICE ALITO: Do we assume for purposes of
this case that your client, a corporation, has a Sixth
Amendment right to a jury trial?
MR. PHILLIPS: I think the language of the
Sixth Amendment couldn't be clearer, that it says in all
criminal prosecutions, the -- the accused is entitled to
a jury trial, and all -- and you know, Article III,
section 2, says in all jury trial -- in all criminal
prosecutions, there's a jury trial. So, there is no
effort whatsoever to limit the -- the individual, or in
any way to -- the person or persons or entities that are
entitled to those rights.
JUSTICE ALITO: What are the peers of the
Southern Union Company that would sit on the jury?
Other railroads?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that would have been --
we'd probably have had a different outcome if that had
been the case. But, no, Your Honor, obviously "peers"
in that context is -- is derived from the citizenry in
the State or the district in which the prosecution is
brought. I mean, obviously, we don't get corporate
peers in that sense, but -- but no one has ever doubted
that an ordinary jury would be a suitable jury of peers
for corporations, and, candidly, corporations are tried
all of the time, and no one has doubted it. And I don't
think it -- you know, first of all, it seems clear,
under the language of the Sixth Amendment and Article
III, that corporations are entitled to a jury and that
no one is -- in anything that's a serious offense, and
that clearly is what we have here.
And so, what we've got is a decision by the
jury that there was at a -- at a single point in time a
violation of RCRA.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not -- the jury
didn't say that the defendant was in violation only 1
day. It said it was in violation within this span of
many months, and it didn't say how many days. It didn't
say whether it was every day or 1 day or 10 days. It
just didn't focus on the number of days. But it didn't
find they were in violation only 1 day, which is what
your opening statement was.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But what the -- what
the First Circuit said, Justice Ginsburg, is that the --
the most you could read the jury to have found, because
it was not asked the question, the most you could read
out of it, was that there was a single day of a
violation, and that that then sets the maximum.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The most -- the most you
must read out of it.
MR. PHILLIPS: The most you must read out of
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. You could -- you
could say it could have meant -- they could have thought
that they violated every day.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. They could have.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't say that for
sure. But one thing you can say for sure is that they
found that it violated it 1 day.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. That's correct,
Justice Scalia, and that, therefore, if you apply the
core Apprendi doctrine in a principled way, as
Justice Kennedy suggested in a separate concurrence, if
you applied it in a principled way, you determine what
-- what facts are supported by the jury's findings and
how far does the penalty take it, and it goes to
$50,000, and anything beyond the $50,000, if it's found
by the judge, doesn't satisfy the Sixth or Fifth
Amendment under those circumstances.
That should be in my judgment the end of the
inquiry. The First Circuit rejected that argument by
turning to Oregon v. Ice and suggesting that there was a
fundamental shift in how the Court applies the Apprendi
doctrine. And I -- I would suggest to you that,
although you're clearly better positioned to determine
what you thought you meant by Ice than I am, my
interpretation of Ice is that it deals with the very
different situation of multiple offenses and the very
different problem of trying to extend the Apprendi
doctrine to the context of multiple convictions and then
adopted a methodology for applying it in those
circumstances that focus significantly on a particular
history of consecutive versus concurrent sentences --
JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't think --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- in that context.
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I was -- I tend to
be in dissent in these cases; so, I don't have the
authoritative view. But the --
MR. PHILLIPS: More so than I do, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: What?
MR. PHILLIPS: More so than I do.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but no. But the
impression I have is that -- that I had thought there
were what I'd call the elements of the offense, and then
there were sentencing facts. And sentencing facts have
been traditionally facts found by the judge when
imposing a sentence.
Now, the majority of the Court in Apprendi
went back into the history and said there is no
significant old tradition, old enough, of -- of
sentencing facts. So, really, when you raise the
sentence, that's like an element, and you should have a
jury trial.
Now, the argument here, one of them, that the
government stresses -- and Ice is the same -- is that
there is no -- the tradition's different where fines and
where multiple and concurrent sentences were at issue.
If you go back to the 18th century or
earlier, what you'll discover is that the judge has
always had a much greater role in deciding what the
amount of a fine should be. And, therefore, insofar as
that amount rested upon some view of the facts as to the
manner in which the crime occurred -- and it always
does -- it was the judge who traditionally found it, not
the jury. So, those facts are not like elements of the
crime.
That's what I thought was essentially the
argument. Ice and fines are on one side of that line,
and Apprendi is on the other.
MR. PHILLIPS: I think the -- the problem
with that analysis, Justice Breyer, is I don't think the
history, first of all, is anywhere near as clear in this
context as it was, for instance, in Ice in terms of who
decided what. It is -- there is no history that
suggests that judges had the authority to impose fines
beyond whatever the maximum statutory limit that was
provided for by the legislature involved. And if you --
and if you go through --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. They're not doing
that here. What they're deciding is a fact of
sentencing is how often this crime was committed. No
one can go against the statutory limit, but rather it --
it allows a higher sentence when certain facts occur.
Now, I thought in Apprendi that the history
is just what I'm saying it was in -- in the fine case,
but the majority says to the contrary. And so, here it
seems, even if I was wrong in Apprendi, that at least
there's enough discretion here to say, look, this is
traditionally up to the judge. Now, why do you think
that isn't so?
MR. PHILLIPS: Because it never was
traditionally up to the judge to go beyond whatever the
maximum sentence provided was. Justice Thomas's
concurrence in Apprendi spends a significant amount of
time with that history. He several times references
jury -- I mean fines and jury determinations and
consistently finds that the same rule applies in the
fine context as applies in the -- in the incarceration
context.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, do you think
that you could say that there was no going above the
statutory maximum here? In other words, you know, if
the judge had said, well, it's $500 a day, I'm going to
find some facts and fine you $600 a day, that would be
going above a statutory maximum.
But I'm wondering whether this is different
because here the judge was sticking to the $500 a day
that was set out in the statute, and then the question
is more, you know, of an -- is it an element or is it a
-- is it a sentencing fact as to how many days the
violation occurred?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Kagan, I would
have thought, if anything, our case would be a much
easier one, because what you -- what you basically are
saying is that the district judge on the basis of a
non-reasonable doubt standard and without a jury is
making a determination that there have been 761
violations of Federal law and, on that basis, imposing a
sentence.
It would seem to me that, whatever else you
might want to say Apprendi should limit, it would be the
whole idea that the judge gets to determine every aspect
of all elements of the crime and the punishment that
attaches to it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there an objection at
trial to the charge on the ground that it didn't
instruct the jury to find the number of days of
violation?
MR. PHILLIPS: The United States didn't
object to that. No, Your Honor. Actually, we didn't
object to it either, and it wasn't an instruction that
was offered by either of the parties. The judge
actually was the one who divined the instruction with
respect to a single --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have no inducement
to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But this was in the
context where the entire defense of the corporation was
consistent with what the indictment said. It was
between the dates on or about, and there -- it would be
very strange under this evidence to think that it was
only there for 1 day, when it was spilled and they came
back. And so, that just doesn't make any sense.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think there's -- that's
just more a sense of background. I do think we have to
reach the issue you -- you present as if it were just --
as if there were no evidence.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- like Justice
Ginsburg, I was very surprised the government didn't
allege -- didn't stress waiver here. You didn't submit
an instruction?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- yes, we didn't
submit an instruction. On the other hand, neither side
submitted the particular instruction that the judge
adopted in this particular case. But what I think is
important is to put it in the context of the -- of the
evidence at trial and the way it was analyzed by the
First Circuit under the -- on the harmless error
standard. Remember that the issue here is not that they
simply have mercury in a particular location without a
permit. The question was, did they -- were they holding
it with an intent to recycle it at some point and to
make it a usable product?
And there were three different points in
time when evidence clearly demonstrated an intent to
obtain an RFP to handle the product in precisely that
way, even up to the summer of 2004, and the indictment
only runs to October of 2004.
So, the notion that it could be a -- a
significantly shorter period, maybe not -- maybe not
just a day, ultimately, but clearly you can't -- we just
don't know because no one asked under those
circumstances. The First Circuit said this could not be
viewed as harmless error, and I think that's not
challenged by the United States at this stage in the
litigation.
And so, it seems to me, as you say,
Justice Kennedy, you have to evaluate the pure issue
of -- you have 1 day of violation, that's the
determination, and when -- and to take the Apprendi
doctrine. As it -- as it's stated, it's quite plain.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips, can you
deal with one policy argument that your adversary raised
that gives me some pause? And that is, the number of
days is certainly something that the jury here could --
relatively easily decided upon. It could have looked at
the evidence and figured that out --
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- okay? But in fraud
cases, in securities cases, sometimes the identity of
victims is not determined for months, till months after
the conviction, and the amount of fine and/or
restitution is set at sentencing.
What's going to happen to all of those
statutes --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because -- or all of
those procedures that have been set up by Congress to
sort of set the amount of loss and repayment? Are all
of those subject to the Apprendi rule?
MR. PHILLIPS: I dont -- I don't think so.
I mean, the lower courts have been pretty consistent on
the question of restitution, that restitution is, one,
not a punishment within the meaning of Apprendi; and,
two, it's indeterminate. And as a consequence of that,
the jury doesn't have to make that determination.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, isn't -- aren't
fines indeterminate here by definition, going back to
Justice Kagan's question? There's no upper limit to how
much the fine could be here. It's set -- the upper
limit is set by the number of days, but why is it
different?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because it is set by
the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is restitution --
MR. PHILLIPS: Because it is set by the
number of days --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, so -- so --
MR. PHILLIPS: -- which requires a predicate
finding of how many days.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how about when a
fine is set by the value of the loss?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's no different than
restitution.
MR. PHILLIPS: And the government will have
to figure out what it -- what it -- its best take as to
the value of the loss, and it's going to have to prove
that if that's going to be the basis on which to fine.
JUSTICE BREYER: My goodness, I think
there's lots of statutes that say something like this:
That within limits, if there's a particular --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, if it's within limits,
that's fundamentally different.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, leave that out
because we assume -- right.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: It says, the fine, the
maximum fine is going to be "not more than the greater
of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss."
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, you're going to send
that to the jury. Let me read you the next phase --
phrase: "unless imposition of a fine under this
subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the
sentencing process."
I point to that next phrase to show you that
Congress understands, in an antitrust case, in a RICO
case, in a corruption case of different kinds, in an
environmental case, it is so complicated figuring out
that kinds of things that they excuse even the judge
who's experienced in this from dealing with that. And
under your theory, as you just point out, if Apprendi
applies here, we're suddenly telling juries to -- they
have to under the Constitution administer that section
U.S.C. 3571, which I just read to you.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, Justice Breyer,
I mean, my first line of defense would be the comment by
this Court consistently that the jury trial right
doesn't necessarily make for the most efficient criminal
proceeding.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, I understand you could
say that's what the Constitution provides, and if you
jury can't handle it, well, too bad. Okay. But I think
we're still in the business of trying to decide whether
the Constitution does provide that in the case of fines.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but I -- I would hope
that the Court wouldn't -- wouldn't let the tail wag the
dog in that particular context.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that a tail? Is that a
tail that the jury proceeding is itself so
unadministrable that even Congress says we recognize
even a judge couldn't do it? All right?
MR. PHILLIPS: My --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, is that --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, recognizing --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that an irrelevant
consideration when you are trying to figure out whether
an ambiguous history requires the jury trial?
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the ambiguous -- the
part of the history that is unambiguous is the
importance of the jury as a bulwark against the Federal
Government and against the judge.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in 1790, in fact in
the first Judiciary Act and in the Crimes Act of 1790,
Congress enacted statutes, criminal statutes, that
authorized a fine and left it entirely to the discretion
of the court. Were those unconstitutional?
MR. PHILLIPS: If it -- up to the maximum.
JUSTICE ALITO: There was no maximum.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, then there -- then it's
an indeterminate sentence, and, of course, they're not
unconstitutional. The core of Apprendi --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Congress permitted --
JUSTICE ALITO: And what's -- what --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in 1790 indeterminate
sentences as well, with no statutory maximum for jail.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think that's what
Justice Scalia -- or Alito was saying.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, they did both --
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with respect to
fines and --
MR. PHILLIPS: Right. They had both, but
the one thing they didn't have is a situation where,
whatever the statutory maximum was, the judge was
permitted to go beyond the maximum based on findings
that the judge offered up on his part without the
benefit of a --
JUSTICE ALITO: So, if the judge can -- if
it's totally up to the discretion of the judge, that's
fine; but if Congress enacts a statute that structures
the fine -- and says, if this is the case, then so much;
if that's the case, then so much more -- then you have
to have a jury trial?
MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely. If --
JUSTICE ALITO: What sense does that make?
MR. PHILLIPS: Because you can take --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that precisely what
Apprendi said? Is --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that was the easy
answer.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
(Laughter.)
MR. PHILLIPS: But, more fundamentally, and
it's -- and it's demonstrated in a case just like this
one --
JUSTICE ALITO: That may be what Apprendi
said, but is it consistent with the original meaning of
the jury trial right in the Sixth Amendment? These
statutes give me pause on that score.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because -- but these
statutes don't speak to what Apprendi was talking about,
which is a situation where you set a maximum above which
the judge is permitted to go. None of the statutes that
are out there exist that demonstrate that. All -- and
all the language and all of the discussion in Justice
Thomas's concurrence talks about up to the -- you know,
you have broad discretion up to the maximum. Once you
go beyond the maximum, at that point the jury trial
right has to kick in.
And let me say it in this context. Here's a
situation where the government proves up its case in the
context of a $50,000 fine; and that's what the jury is
asked to decide, and it decides that; and then the judge
gets to say: Okay, $38 million is now the right number.
If that's not the tail wagging the dog within the
meaning of even the cases that preceded Apprendi, it
seems to me there's a fundamental flaw in that
particular scheme.
The history between fines and incarceration
are essentially the same. What the Court said in
Apprendi should be followed exactly under these
circumstances. Ice should be distinguished on the
recognition that multiple offenses are fundamentally
different from a single offense. And on that basis the
judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you make of this
old case that the Government cites, U.S. v. Tyler? And
it was the question of -- the penalty was four times the
value of the goods, and this Court said the judge, not
the jury, is responsible for imposing the fine and,
therefore, also for determining the value of the goods.
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Tyler is in -- in many
ways kind of imponderable. The one thing that's clear,
it's not a Sixth Amendment decision. It wasn't actually
argued. All it says is that under this law -- and the
problem, obviously, in this case was they found -- you
know, it was -- the pounds weren't -- weren't the
problem. The problem was obviously they had identified
one substance in the indictment, and the jury found
another substance in its verdict; and so, there was the
disconnect there, and the Court basically said we're not
going to worry about that trifling under these
circumstances.
What it doesn't say remotely is that the
Sixth -- is that -- you know, that the Sixth Amendment
would permit the judge to make that finding under those
circumstances.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were to prevail, I
-- I think it would be a rather simple matter for the
parties to frame an instruction: We find the defendant
guilty and that the pollutant was retained for X days,
much of what they do in a drug case. That's one way to
do it. Could the government do it by the indictment?
Could it indict alternatively, indict on count 1 for 10
days, count 2 for 50 days, or something like that?
MR. PHILLIPS: They could do it that way
or --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe -- is that the way
it often works or --
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I would have thought
actually the indictment in this case was probably
adequate for these purposes because it said: During the
entirety of the period from September 2002 to
October 2004.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's why I am
surprised the government waived it, and I thought that's
what the evidence showed anyway. But that's not before
us. That's not the way the case is presented here.
MR. PHILLIPS: Right, Your Honor. That's
correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: How, in general -- I mean,
in the individual case, very often a trial doesn't come
up because 90 percent or more of the time it's just a
question of a plea bargain; and, therefore, the
defendant doesn't -- this is an added weapon for him,
Apprendi. But in your -- with your clients and the others,
there might be quite a lot of trials.
So, how in a trial does your client or
others in that position defend on the ground of we
didn't do this at all; but by the way, in case you
decide to the contrary, jury, we want to tell you we
only did it Monday, Wednesday, and Friday?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: How is that supposed to
work? Do you have two juries?
MR. PHILLIPS: No. Well, I mean, look, if
we think we're going to be prejudiced as a consequence
of trying this in a particular way, it will be our call
whether or not to waive the jury trial right under those
circumstances. But, more fundamentally, at least in
this particular case, obviously our position was we
didn't form the intent at any point in time and -- but,
you know, if ultimately the -- the jury had found that
there was some other point in time, then, you know,
we'll deal with that issue as we deal with it.
But it wouldn't have been -- I don't think
the trial in this case would have been significantly
different. The only thing that would have been
different is that the jury would have been properly
instructed and our jury trial right would have been
preserved. As it is here, our jury trial right has been
savagely undermined.
If there are no further questions, I reserve
the balance of my time, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Phillips.
Mr. Dreeben.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This case, like Oregon v. Ice, involves the
kind of finding that the common law never entrusted to
the jury. There is, therefore, no erosion or
encroachment on the jury function by assigning the
function of determining the days of violation to the
court for the purpose of determining the criminal fine.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree, don't
you, that the statement in Oregon v. Ice was pure dicta?
MR. DREEBEN: The Court's statement in Ice
-- that if a purely algebraic application of Apprendi
were followed, it would sweep in things such as fines
and restitution -- was not necessary to the judgment,
Mr. Chief Justice, but it was part of the Court's
rationale in adopting a different take on the meaning of
the Apprendi line of cases than had previously been
espoused. Up until --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, I think the
reference -- it was a fleeting reference to fines, and
it could have meant that the judge has discretion to set
the fine up to the maximum in the statute. That's one
possible meaning.
MR. DREEBEN: That is true, Justice
Ginsburg. But I think that the author of the opinion in
Ice was citing to an amicus brief filed by States, which
supplied illustrations of fine statutes that it believed
would be imperiled by a purely programmatic rule-based
application of Apprendi.
And two of the State statutes that were
cited in that amicus brief, that of New Jersey and
Alaska, involved the kind of gain or loss statute that
has been discussed this morning, in which the judge,
following the rendition of a guilty verdict, determined
the amount of gain or loss and then applied either a
double or triple amount as the maximum fine.
JUSTICE SCALIA: This was -- you're not
arguing that this rule will apply only to fines against
corporations? It would also apply to individuals,
right?
MR. DREEBEN: Correct, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's up to the judge to
decide how many days or what the value was and so forth.
Right?
MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So, the right to trial by
jury to have that very important fact found does not
exist, even for individuals?
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, the tradition
with respect to monetary fines is different than the
tradition that the Court analyzed in Apprendi. With
respect to fines, restitution, and forfeiture, the jury
was never given a substantive role at common law. And
the law today is with respect to forfeiture --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure how you can
fully make that argument, because I thought the history
was set forth fairly clearly in Apprendi that the early
history was that nothing was given to the jury with
respect to imprisonment or fines because most if not all
sentences were indeterminate. It's only when States
began, and the Federal government, to experiment with
determinate sentences that the Apprendi issue then
became live.
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Sotomayor, I think
what Apprendi relied on primarily was the linkage
between charge and penalty in English law, which was,
for felonies, death. The Court distinguished in a
footnote the tradition with respect to misdemeanors,
which it acknowledged was judicial discretion with
respect to fines and whippings, and it did not rely on
that history in fashioning the Apprendi rule.
What it relied on were two things: First,
the traditional linkage between charge and authorized
penalty in English common law; and, second, the
tradition in America that when the legislature had put a
cap on the amount of the penalty, the judge had
discretion within it not to go above it.
But neither of those aspects of Apprendi
addressed the issue that's before the Court today, which
is whether it would be an expansion beyond the domain
that was covered in Apprendi to apply it to monetary
penalties in --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, explain to me, other
than your reliance on Ice, some sort of tradition,
which, you know, we can debate whether you can draw any
conclusion from tradition in any of these areas, whether
it's imprisonment or fines.
Tell me on the logic of Apprendi, not using
Ice, why fines are different, without relying on
history, which to me is -- I view it as ambiguous.
Okay?
MR. DREEBEN: It's difficult to do that,
Justice Sotomayor, because the Court fashioned the
Apprendi rule from history, and it limited it based on
history in Ice. It doesn't operate as an algorithm that
simply applies automatic --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought it was a fairly
simple algorithm. It says if the statutory penalty --
if a judge's factfinding can increase the statutory
penalty, then that's a violation of the Sixth Amendment.
A jury has to find any fact that increases the statutory
maximum.
MR. DREEBEN: Yes, and that -- that was the
argument of the Ice dissenters, that Apprendi states a
rule that knows no exceptions for history or the impact
on the States. And Ice does represent I think a --
shows where the high-water mark of Apprendi was. The
high-water mark was with respect to the penalty of
imprisonment.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, outside of a -- a --
imprisonment, there is no other penalty that Congress
could fashion because it has no history that wouldn't be
within the purview of the judge?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, of course, the death
penalty in Ring v. Arizona. The Court held that facts
that expose a defendant to the death penalty must be
found by the jury. So, the Court has extended Apprendi
to those core liberty areas. But even with respect to
the implications for the length of imprisonment, the
quantum of punishment that a defendant faces when he's
convicted of multiple offenses, this Court in Ice looked
to history and the impact on the administration of
justice before being willing to extend Apprendi outside
of its core domain. And I think it's highly relevant --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Dreeben, wasn't the
core domain defined by whether it related to a specific
statutory offense? So, Ice says the core concern is "a
legislative attempt to remove from the province of the
jury the determination of facts that warrant a
punishment for a specific statutory offense." How is
that not relevant precisely in this context?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, it is, of course,
relevant, Justice Kagan, but --
JUSTICE KAGAN: How does it not determine
this context? I mean, those --
MR. DREEBEN: Because the Court went on
several paragraphs later in its opinion to describe what
it would mean to adopt a formulaic application of
Apprendi, treating it just as a rule divorced from
history. And one of the consequences that the Court
considered was the impact it would have on sentencing
accoutrements, two of which are directly related to this
case because they are financial penalties, fines and
restitution.
Now, I've talked about how the amicus brief
that prompted that paragraph, the concern about the
implications of expanding Apprendi, referred to fine
statutes that operate on a gain or loss basis, which
necessarily requires judicial factfinding after the
guilty verdict comes in.
But if the Court isn't satisfied with those,
restitution which is explicitly mentioned in Apprendi --
excuse me -- in Ice, classically operates based on
findings about victim loss that occur after the guilty
verdict has come in. This Court is well familiar that
oftentimes courts have to postpone sentencing in order
to allow the victim to gather evidence and to present
Now, the Court could, I suppose, do as the
lower courts have done and say restitution is different
because it's designed simply to compensate for loss;
and, therefore, it's in one sense remedial. But that
will have to deal with the fact that in cases like
Pasquantino v. United States and Pennsylvania v.
Davenport, the Court has described restitution as a
criminal penalty.
Now, the other way in which lower courts
have said that restitution isn't swept up by Apprendi is
to say it's a rule that has no maximum. Whatever the
amount of harm to the victim is, that can be compensated
through restitution.
But, again, if one is applying an algebraic
understanding of the relevant statutory maximum from the
Blakely decision, restitution would be hard to justify
because the jury verdict does not contain findings about
harm to victims. The jury verdict finds guilt.
Afterwards, the judge finds an additional fact, namely
the amount of harm, and imposes restitution. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of odd,
though, isn't it? I mean, to some extent, this is a
little easier case for you, because it does involve a
corporation. But there are statutes where the amount of
imprisonment and the amount of a fine can both increase
based on a particular fact.
MR. DREEBEN: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And under your
submission, if you have -- you know, say a defendant who
is subject to 1 year, and that if a particular fact is
found, he's subject to 2 years, a fine of 20 but then
, the judge would be constitutionally prohibited from
increasing the prison sentence but would be perfectly
free to increase the fine --
MR. DREEBEN: Probably --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- including in a
situation where the fine might be a lot more serious
than the -- the time in prison.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, probably,
Mr. Chief Justice, such a statute would be construed to
make that fact one for the jury, since it dictates
imprisonment increases as well as fine increases. And
so, the constitutional question is unlikely to arise.
Congress would have been deemed to have intended that
that kind of a fact go to the jury.
That's not what -- the case in this statute.
This statute provides a 5-year maximum penalty, and then
it provides a fine amount that's graduated to the days
of the violation. The violation in this case was one
single violation. The judge did not find that there
were multiple violations; the judge simply looked at the
record, and his task is to decide how long did that
violation --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, he operated --
he operated in a reasonable way. But we give juries the
discretion to be unreasonable. It would not -- juries
often compromise. So, if the instructions and the
verdict told the jury you can find the defendant, you
know, guilty for 1 day or whatever it is -- the 30
million; 50,000 or 30 million -- it would not be at all
unusual for the jury to debate and say, well, let's find
him guilty for 10 million.
MR. DREEBEN: We do presume --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And return that
verdict. The judge is constrained by reason in a way
that the jury is not, and that's sort of -- that's part
of the protection the Sixth Amendment provided.
MR. DREEBEN: This Court has never
recognized jury nullification as a constitutionally
protected right. We presume a rational jury. We
presume that if the jury is confronted with the evidence
and the law as given to it by the court, it will apply
that law in a rational manner. And the question here is
whether that is something that the jury is
constitutionally entitled to do.
Now, coming back to the historical
foundations of the Apprendi rule and the extension
that's requested here, with all due respect to
Petitioner, I think United States v. Tyler is much more
significant than Petitioner gives it credit for.
This is a case decided in 1812 on a Court
that had on it Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story.
These were people who were well steeped in common law
traditions and well familiar with how judges would find
facts at the time of the founding. And in Tyler, there
was a charge that the defendant had unlawfully exported,
in violation of an embargo law, an amount of pearl ashes
that were worth $600. And the jury came back with a
verdict that said we find that the defendant unlawfully
exported pot ashes worth $280. And the question is:
Could a verdict be imposed on this, and could the judge
set the fine?
The two judges on the circuit court
disagreed, and so it was certified to the Supreme Court.
And this Court held unanimously that finding a valuation
was a judge function, not a jury function. No valuation
was necessary in order for the court to impose the
proper fine.
And it's difficult to understand how this
Court could have said that, if there were such a
well-settled constitutionally protected entitlement to a
jury verdict on facts that dictated a fine, if indeed
this statute assigned the role to the judge and the
Court was fully comfortable with that role being carried
out.
And Tyler is a decision of this Court.
There is no decision of this Court with respect to
imprisonment that is anything like Tyler. The
traditions with respect to imprisonment would surely be
understood in a different manner than with respect to
fines. And when one looks at fines, restitution, and
forfeiture as a package of possible financial penalties
and asks the question, did the Framers envision that
these matters would be within the jury's domain as
opposed to the judge's in imposing the appropriate
sentence after a jury verdict, I think that the answer
is they would not have viewed it as a matter protected
by the Sixth Amendment, because there was no factual
predicate in the common Law that would have led them to
believe the jury's function would be eroded if those
matters were not.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A very -- very
simple matter for the government to ask for jury
findings on the questions at issue in this case, right?
MR. DREEBEN: We could have done it here,
Mr. Chief Justice. The broader concern is cases that
involve gain or loss, in which the question of how much
loss may have been suffered by hundreds or even
thousands of victims of fraud is typically not
undertaken -- the process of quantifying them isn't done
until the guilty verdict is in because it's an
enormously difficult and complicated task. As
Justice Breyer pointed out, the judge isn't even
required to do it at sentencing if it proves to be too
complicated.
And for jury trials to do it, there may well
be a need for bifurcation. And this Court in
Oregon v. Ice declined to impose on the States the need
to bifurcate trials to determine whether a sentence
should be run consecutively or concurrently, because
that would intrude upon a valuable reform that was
designed to provide some restraints on judicial
discretion.
The same kind of thing would operate here if
this Court adopts an across-the-board rule that fines
have to be proved to a jury. If it extended it to
restitution and to forfeiture, that would involve
overruling the Court's decision in Libretti v. United
States, which held that forfeiture is a sentencing
function. But upon a strict application of Apprendi, a
mathematically, geometrically accurate application of
the rule stated in Apprendi, it's difficult to see why
forfeiture is not something that has to be --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, let's talk
about Tyler. Tyler was not argued before this Court.
MR. DREEBEN: Correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a one-page opinion.
It's later described quite accurately as focusing not
upon the amount of the fine, but rather upon a
misdescription of pot ashes as pearl ashes, right?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't agree with --
that it's later been characterized that way. It was
characterized in a decision that was written by Justice
Story --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.
MR. DREEBEN: -- in the same year. Justice
Story was on Tyler. He wrote -- he sat on circuit in a
case called United States v. Mann.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Quite so.
MR. DREEBEN: And this is in our brief. And
he -- he interpreted Tyler and said the court would not
have given the direction that it did, that a judgment
could be entered based on the fine amount, unless they
were satisfied that an indictment lay and that the fine
was to be imposed by the court and not found by the jury
as a penalty.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The jury did find it in
Tyler, though, didn't it? The question was submitted to
the jury, wasn't it?
MR. DREEBEN: The jury --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't -- why doesn't
that indicate what the historical practice was?
MR. DREEBEN: Because the Court stated that
the part of the verdict which is subject -- which we're
discussing right now is to be regarded as surplusage.
In other words, this -- Tyler explains that although it
was submitted to the jury, it wasn't necessary to be
submitted to the jury. The charge had asked for $600 of
value which would then be subject to the fine. The jury
found only $280.
And as I interpret the Court's decision and
I think as Justice Story interpreted it sitting on
circuit in Mann, it said this isn't a jury function.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Did it -- as a matter of
statutory construction, right?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, the -- again, I would
readily concede, Justice Scalia, that the Sixth
Amendment does not appear --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. DREEBEN: -- in the Court's decision in
Tyler, but it's difficult for me to understand that a
Court that included Chief Justice Marshall, Justice
Story, and other members who were well familiar with how
common law operated would have adopted an interpretation
of a statute that was facially unconstitutional.
I -- I don't submit that this decision
grapples with what we now know to be the Apprendi
doctrine. I simply submit it as evidence that this
Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't think they
believed in the Apprendi doctrine, either, right?
MR. DREEBEN: No. I -- they didn't have the
benefit of having read Apprendi in order to render their
decision. They -- they were deciding the question that
was certified up to them.
My submission is that they wouldn't have
decided the case that way if they thought, based on
their familiarity with the common law, that fines were
the kind of thing that had to go to a jury.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Might have helped if they
had argument, right?
MR. DREEBEN: I think they felt they did not
need it, because the matter was sufficiently obvious
that all members of the Court could agree on it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What about all of the
th-century cases cited by Justice Thomas's concurrence
in Apprendi? Fine cases.
MR. DREEBEN: There are three of them.
JUSTICE SCALIA: In which course -- in which
courts did indeed require the amount of the fines to be
found by the jury.
MR. DREEBEN: There are three of them. The
earliest one is Commonwealth v. Smith. It's a
Massachusetts case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Massachusetts, right.
MR. DREEBEN: And the Court in that case --
its analysis I think is even briefer than the analysis
we've just discussed in Tyler.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Was it an argued case, at
least?
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, I'd have to go
back and look at the opinion to tell you whether it was
an argued case. There's no citation of any
constitutional law in -- in that decision.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What makes acceptable
common law? Let's assume there weren't 50 States back
then, but whatever the number was, 20 States, and 15 of
them submitted it to the jury and 5 didn't. Does that
mean there was no common law that this was generally
submitted to the jury? If you can point to one case,
that's enough to defeat the existence of a common law
view?
MR. DREEBEN: I doubt that I would say that,
Justice Sotomayor. The -- the jurisprudence of the
former colonies/new States is not uniform. I -- the --
there is something I think of mythology in speaking
about the common law as one indivisible body of law.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- you see, that's
my problem.
MR. DREEBEN: And I don't disagree with you
on that point, Justice Sotomayor; but I think that there
is one fact that truly stands out about fines, and that
is they were historically at common law products of
judicial discretion.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But so was imprisonment.
MR. DREEBEN: Imprisonment was rare.
Imprisonment was hardly ever imposed in the early
colonies and in England, because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how many statutes
had anything but indeterminate fine structures?
MR. DREEBEN: I -- I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many statutes in the
early common law had anything but indeterminate fine
statutes?
MR. DREEBEN: A few did. And I've attempted
to read up on the law of North Carolina, the law of
Pennsylvania, the law of Massachusetts, the law of New
York. It's all varied and complicated, but there were a
few of them there.
JUSTICE SCALIA: If it's varied and
complicated, why should we -- assuming that it's
ambiguous, why should we adopt the strange rule that the
jury has to find the fact if you go to jail for 2 weeks,
but doesn't have to find the fact if the amount of fines
multiplied by number of days or by anything else will --
will make a pauper of you? Why would we adopt such a
strange rule?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, the fact that there
were --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless compelled to do --
to do so by a clear common law history?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, none of those statutes
assigned the role of finding fines to juries. There may
be an example or two that one could find if you dig
through the mass of colonial records, but the dominant
trend, and it was acknowledged by Blackstone, was that
the common law never assigned the responsibility of
fines to the jury, and statutes did so rarely.
Imprisonment simply doesn't help very much in this area,
because the resources required to imprison just didn't
exist, and imprisonment really is a product that
developed in the late --
JUSTICE BREYER: What about the other two?
I just -- I was very interested in your colloquy here.
You said, well, there were three cases in the 19th
century where they did say the jury --
MR. DREEBEN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: And one of them was a very
brief opinion from Massachusetts.
MR. DREEBEN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, Massachusetts counts
in its favor, but perhaps the brief opinion doesn't.
The --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: What about the other two?
MR. DREEBEN: Another one of them is
Massachusetts.
JUSTICE BREYER: Both Massachusetts. Well,
it's getting stronger.
MR. DREEBEN: Yes. We have Hope -- Hope in
45, which cites back to Smith and relied on it, and
then there is an -- an arson case called Ritchey from
Indiana in which the court did seem to think that in
order to sustain a proper prosecution where the fine
amount varied based on the destruction of the property,
the jury had to find the amount of the property
valuation.
But this is 1845. It's not something that
would have been present to the mind of the Framers. It
doesn't indicate clearly what the source of law is,
whether it's a common law tradition, whether it's
following something like Smith. Smith itself I think is
also best understood as a larceny case, and there was
more of an established tradition that in larceny cases,
the value of the property taken was relevant to the
jury's findings because it made the difference between a
capital offense -- a capital offense that could be given
with benefit of clergy, which was basically a way for
the English judges to mitigate a death-eligible crime to
a non-death penalty, or petty larceny, which was
punished by fines and whipping. So, it graded the
offense in a way that, for example, the fine penalty at
issue in this case does not.
Petitioner is guilty of a felony by virtue
of the jury verdict. That imposes the stigma of being a
felon on Petitioner. The judge's role is then to decide
what was charged in the indictment and what was the
length of that violation, not to find Petitioner guilty
of numerous additional violations.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What if the judge disagreed
with the jury about whether there was even a violation?
MR. DREEBEN: The jury's acquittal would end
the criminal case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, no. The jury
finds a violation, but the judge thinks the jury got it
wrong.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, in that case --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How does -- how does he
pick the -- the number of days? He flips a coin?
MR. DREEBEN: Unless the -- the judge finds
that the evidence is insufficient under Jackson v.
Virginia, he's bound by the jury.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, he finds, you know,
they could have come out that way, but -- but they were
wrong.
MR. DREEBEN: Then I think that he would be
bound by the day of violation, $50,000 limit, subject to
another provision of Federal law, 3573(c), which
provides in the case of an organization that a felony
exposes the defendant to a $500,000 fine. So, there --
there would be other limits applicable in Federal law
that would explain what the judge is supposed to do in
that situation.
The judge, of course, is operating in a
different way than the jury. The jury is finding guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge is applying a
preponderance of the evidence standard. This Court in
United States v. Watts has recognized that judges can
find facts that the jury may have rejected under the
higher standard.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the whole problem.
That is indeed the whole problem.
MR. DREEBEN: It's only the whole problem,
Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The judge doesn't have to
find that this defendant beyond a reasonable doubt
committed the violation on so many days. The jury
would.
MR. DREEBEN: The only --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The judge can simply say,
well, you know, all in all, probably they did it --
probably. More likely than not they did it so many
days. It's a big difference.
MR. DREEBEN: It's only a problem,
Justice Scalia, if the Sixth Amendment protects a
defendant's right to it. And the question that was --
as framed in Ice, is whether the legislative innovation,
the reform aimed to structure the discretion of a court
which at the Founding era might have been impose
whatever fine you like with no limits whatsoever, except
the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment --
Congress has come along, as have the State legislatures,
and sought to structure the deliberations with respect
to financial penalties.
Fines, restitution, and forfeiture are now
structured in a way that basically sends the decision to
the judge or lowers the standard of proof to a
preponderance in the case of forfeiture amounts that --
that are decided by a Federal jury without the
constraints of the Apprendi rule.
And that distinction between financial
penalties and infringements on life or liberty is
consistent with a Sixth Amendment theme. Deprivations
of life or liberty attract a greater degree of
protection than fine amounts or other financial
penalties. There is substantive constitutional
protection in the Eighth Amendment --
JUSTICE KAGAN: What other rules do you
think are different? I mean, is there a jury trial in
the one case but not in the other? Is there a right to
counsel in the one case but not in the other? What else
turns on this fine/incarceration distinction?
MR. DREEBEN: In the right to counsel area,
the Court has held that for misdemeanors, if the
defendant goes to prison, he's entitled to counsel; if
the defendant does not, he is not entitled to counsel.
With respect to jury trials, a petty offense which is
generally one punishable by less than 6 months in
prison, there is no jury trial right. A penalty of
greater than 6 months in prison indicates a more serious
offense.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What if you call it a
misdemeanor but -- but impose a very heavy fine? It's
still a misdemeanor?
MR. DREEBEN: It is still a misdemeanor
because the primary indication --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you don't have right to
counsel. Right?
MR. DREEBEN: That is -- that is this
Court's jurisprudence. This Court in Scott and
Argersinger drew the line at actual imprisonment,
recognizing that deprivations of liberty have a more
serious criminal implication than financial penalties.
And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that makes it clear to
you that there's no overlap between property and
liberty, so that no matter how much of your property are
taken and what circumstances, it's just property;
there's no liberty involved?
MR. DREEBEN: There is, of course, an
important constitutional value in deprivations of
property. It's protected by due process, and the
Excessive Fines Clause explicitly addresses the
possibility that the judge may impose an unjustified
penalty. There are also nonconstitutional sources of
protection such as reasonableness review, which
Petitioner got in this case, and the First Circuit
upheld the amount of the fine as reasonable.
The only question here is whether, despite
the lack of a historical pedigree and despite this
Court's decision in Tyler and despite the adverse effect
on the administration of justice, the Apprendi rule
needs to be expanded where it has never been applied
previously to encompass fines. And I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you want -- want us to
write as part of that decision that no matter how great
the fine, liberty is not involved?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, liberty in the sense of
imprisonment is not involved. Corporations I don't
think can be deprived of --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Liberty in the sense of
what the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth amendment
say.
MR. DREEBEN: I don't think a corporation
can be deprived of liberty within the meaning of the
Fifth Amendment. It can't be put in prison; it can't be
restricted from, you know, activities that are
comprehended --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I guess you don't
need counsel on any suits against corporations, right?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think
corporations can appear in court except through counsel.
They don't have a sort of distinct --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument isn't
limited to corporations, though.
MR. DREEBEN: No, this -- this is a rule
that is responsive to the history with respect to
financial punishments.
JUSTICE BREYER: So, do you need any more
than that? I mean, do we have to get into this? Isn't
it just a question of whether there is a tradition in
the law that juries, rather than judges, would determine
what used to be called sentencing facts; facts related
not to the crime, but to the imposition of the
punishment where that's a fine?
MR. DREEBEN: May I answer?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, we're not
asking the Court to reconsider its Apprendi line of
cases. We're asking it to apply the analysis that
limited Apprendi in Oregon v. Ice.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Phillips, you have 7 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Hopefully, I'll be able to give you back a
couple of those minutes.
I'd like to -- I'd like to start with what
seems to me ultimately the fundamental notion of the
United States' position, which is that there is a vast
gulf somehow between fines and imprisonment. And it
seems to me very difficult within the constitutional
structure to embrace that approach when, obviously,
property interests are protected in the Fifth Amendment;
they're protected in the Eighth Amendment. And if you
go back to Blackstone, where he talks about inflicting
corporal punishment or a stated imprisonment of a term,
which is better than an excessive fine, for that amounts
to imprisonment for life, there's the recognition
historically that fines have an enormous impact on
individuals and, of course, are entitled to fundamental
constitutional protections. It seems to me that the
Government's approach there to saying fines are off the
table and it's completely open season on defendants
under those circumstances is unjustifiable.
With respect to restitution, I already
suggested to the Court all lower courts have concluded
that restitution is not within the Apprendi doctrine. I
don't think that's going to be a problem under these
circumstances.
And -- and I don't think ultimately that the
issue in this case is sort of what is or is not the
common law tradition. Because I -- if I go back and I
think -- I read Justice Thomas's concurrence and the
history there, he doesn't even mention Tyler as part
of -- as part of that analysis and, yet, concludes with
what I think is a very powerful assessment, that juries
would be available for fines up to, you know, within --
if it were going to go beyond some kind of a maximum.
But within the maximum, obviously in that context, the
judge would have complete discretion on -- on how to
approach it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the amount of
loss issue that Justice Breyer raised, was very
complicated to determine what the amount of the loss is?
MR. PHILLIPS: Right.
Justice Ginsburg, I think it's worth
considering two facts in this case in dealing with what
I think is purely a policy argument that shouldn't
override the Constitution. But the first one is that --
the notion that Apprendi applies to fines has been well
accepted in 99 percent of the country for more than a
decade. And the Antitrust Division operates and makes
these kinds of decisions all the time. Fraud
prosecutions are going forward.
The amicus brief that was filed by the
Chamber of Commerce demonstrates categorically they --
this -- this gets done every day, and it gets done
effectively. So, whatever the problem of Apprendi, it
has not surfaced. And -- and you'll look in the
Government's brief for any specific evidence of the
complaint that it makes other than the hypothetical
possibility that their parade of horribles would play
out.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we --
MR. PHILLIPS: This Court has rejected that
parade of horribles in every other Apprendi context.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- on the question of
the value of goods or the amount of the loss, what would
the standard be? Would the jury have to find beyond a
reasonable doubt that it was -- that the value was such
and such?
MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I think that's precisely
what the jury would be asked to find. And juries are
asked to find that all the time, and they make that kind
of a determination.
And I guess the last point that I think as a
practical matter that ought -- the Court ought to take
notice of is that no State filed an amicus brief in this
case, that Apprendi has not been the problem in the
fines context that would even warrant anybody to come in
here and complain about it.
It seems to me the right answer is to apply
the core doctrine, the core principle of Apprendi, which
even the Government concedes, if you just take the
language, it talks about any fact that increases the
penalty, that algorithm takes you to the conclusion the
judgment below should be reversed.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I may have just
forgotten, but does your brief go through the status of
what lower courts have decided with respect to fines and
how they're dealing with them? I just don't remember it
as being part of your brief, the statement you just
made to Justice Kennedy.
MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we do -- I mean, we do
make the -- we demonstrated two things: one, that the
lower courts pretty consistently have rejected the First
Circuit's approach --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay.
