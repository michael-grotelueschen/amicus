CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
next in Case 13-212, United States v. Wurie.
Welcome back.
(Laughter.)
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The facts of this case, United States v.
Wurie, I think, illustrate why any categorical rule that
would preclude searches of cell phones incident to
arrest would be inconsistent with historical practice
and detrimental to law enforcement.
This is a case where what the officers did
was see a phone ringing.  On the outside screen, the
caller was identified as "my house."  The officers
opened up the phone, pressed one button to see that the
call came in from "my house" and pressed another to see
what the phone number was.  That's all they did.
That kind of a search serves valid,
time-honored functions in the search situation of
helping to ascertain the identity of the offender.  This
was a crucial fact because a few minutes later, Wurie
lied about where he lived, which was relevant to the
police ultimately obtaining a warrant to search his
house.  They didn't know where he was.  They would not
be able to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not -- I'm not
sure.  If he was at the precinct, they could have gotten
a warrant, and once he lied about his arrest, they would
have known he wasn't living there and would have gotten
a warrant.
MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Sotomayor, you could
almost always say in search-incident-to-arrest cases
that the police could have gotten a warrant.  It's --
I'm not talking about cases where somebody is carrying a
gun and the police take the gun off them and -- and they
secure it that way.  But in all of the other cases that
you could imagine that involve searches for evidence,
letters, which occur in the historical cases; billfolds,
which have been discussed here, once the officer has it,
you could say the officer shouldn't be able to look in
it because that could be done under a warrant.  There's
no time constraint.  There's no destruction of evidence
constraint.
Here, in fact, there actually is a
destruction-of-evidence threat with respect to the
general category of cell phones, and that's what this
Court has been asked to look at, the general category,
cell phones and smartphones.
We discussed earlier the threat of remote
wiping and whether airplane mode is an effective counter
to that.  There is the other threat that I think is even
more critical to law enforcement today, and that is
encryption.  Because if the phone turns off and becomes
encrypted, officers can go to the magistrate and ask for
a warrant, but it may be months or years or never if
they can break through the encryption and actually
obtain the evidence.
So to the extent that the traditional
destruction-of-evidence rationale justified the search
of a cell phone or justified the search of traditional
items, it applies even more strongly with respect to
cell phones than it does with most of the items that
might be seized from a person.
So Wurie, I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Please tell me about
encryption, because I know people can encrypt, but I
thought they had to do that when they put the
information in the phone.
MR. DREEBEN:  No.  As best I understand it,
Justice Sotomayor, many smartphones today are equipped
with built-in encryption.  Apple has hardware encryption
and software encryption.  Samsung and HTC and other
brands are quickly following with strong encryption.
The encryption is deployed in a way that if you don't
have the key, the data that's on the phone is useless.
The key is often stored in memory and it's accessible
only when you can get into the phone.
Now, if the phone is on and functioning
because the person has been arrested while they are, for
example, making a phone call, you can get access to the
phone and you can attempt to get information from the
phone without the encryption key being an obstacle.  But
if the encryption is deployed, that can sometimes be an
insuperable barrier even to the manufacturer.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure how on the
scene the police are going to look at everything in a
cell phone anyway.  They've got to be doing something to
save it.  If the encryption can be --
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, no.  The -- the evidence
is -- the information on the phone is encrypted -- this
is my understanding, Justice Sotomayor -- but the phone
itself has the key to decrypt it because the user
obviously wants to get access to the information.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, you have a problem.
Apparently, neither you nor I actually have this on
their phone, as far as I know.  So I'm imagining
something.  Maybe you have it.  There is some kind of
system that once it goes "bzzz," you never can get the
stuff again except after eight months, and when this
"bzzz" happens, is it happens at least ten minutes after
the arrest and not before, so the policeman would have
time to look at it.  But the -- by the time you get to
the stationhouse, the "bzzz" has already happened, so
now nobody else can.  Maybe there is such a thing.  I've
never heard of it before this minute or before the
briefs.  Well, why wouldn't -- you see I'm similarly
incredulous about it from my tone of voice because I
don't see why somebody who wanted to "bzzz" actually to
keep the police away wouldn't do it after 30 seconds.
MR. DREEBEN:  So if you have an iPhone,
Justice Breyer, and I don't know what kind of phone that
you have --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't either because I
can never get into it because of the password.
(Laughter.)
MR. DREEBEN:  It's encrypted.  And that's
the problem.  The phones are set up to protect the data
and I think this is something also revealing about --
JUSTICE BREYER:  My point is, somebody who
really wants to go to all that trouble will surely have
it turn off after 30 seconds and the policeman won't be
able to look at it either.
MR. DREEBEN:  Not all criminals are so
clever that they manage --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  Well, but the dim
criminal who is thinking about the magistrate at the
station but not thinking about the policeman.  I mean,
you see what I'm doing with my questions?
MR. DREEBEN:  I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm casting a little cold
water on this as a rationale.
MR. DREEBEN:  Yeah.  And I -- my response to
you is that having tried to ascertain the empirical
reality of this problem, it is greatly feared by law
enforcement.  We've documented that by the numerous
studies, the National Institute of Standards and
Technology study that talks about the grave concerns
that encryption's raised.  It's not the biggest problem
if you get the phone in an active state and you can
begin to look through it.  It does have unpredictable
capabilities of becoming encrypted if it's turned off or
if certain apps are deployed on it.  And for that
reason --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you have to keep the
phone going anyway till you can get to a place where you
do something with it.
MR. DREEBEN:  A lot of these searches occur,
Justice Sotomayor, at the side of the road where the
officer opens -- in the Riley case, the officer opened
the phone right on the heels of the arrest and he
immediately saw evidence that the individual was a gang
member, something that he hadn't had personal knowledge
of before, because every letter K was preceded by a C,
which indicated to him it meant Crip killer, which
indicated he was a member of the Bloods gang.  So it's a
very common thing for officers to take advantage of the
information that's on a phone just the way that they
would take advantage of the information that's on a
person to find out who they are dealing with.
And I think it was asked in the Riley
argument whether there were instances in which phones
have been used to trigger dangers.  And there are
instances in which people have used their cell phones
right before an arrest to call in a posse of their
accomplices to basically attack the police.  And by
looking at the cell phone quickly, if it's available to
the -- to the officers, they can look quickly and see if
there was a text sent in the last five minutes or a
phone call that might actually protect their safety,
which is another one of the traditional justifications
of search incident to arrest.
This is a categorical exception, as the
Court recognized twice last term, both in Maryland v.
King decision and in the McNeely decision, the Court
recognized that search-incident-to-arrest was a
categorical exception to the normal warrant requirement.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Dreeben, something
that you said about the encryption.  What -- what is the
experience of the police?  Isn't it so that most cell
phones when they're found on a person are not open,
that -- that they are locked?
MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Ginsburg, I would not
be able to answer a question about what condition most
cell phones are found in.  The fact that this issue has
arisen repeatedly in cases across the country indicates
that at least in a significant number of cases, the
phones are not locked and the officers are able to
obtain access to the information.
Now, if they are not able to obtain access
to the information, I want to tie this back to things
that could give the Court some comfort if the Court were
concerned about the possibility for police searching too
much evidence in cell phones that's not relevant to the
crime for which the person is arrested or his identity.
Now, we talked earlier about the crime of
arrest limitation, which I think would screen out a
great many, not all, minor crimes.  The Court has, at
least in the Welsh v. Wisconsin case, talking about
exigent circumstances justifying an entry into the home,
distinguished between serious and minor crimes.  That's
another possible line that the Court could explore.  I'm
not as much in favor of that one because I do think that
the officers have an interest in determining, no matter
who they have arrested, who that person is, because the
person could pose an unknown threat even if they are
stopped only for a traffic violation.  Ascertaining
their identity through their cell phone is a useful way
to do that.
There are also potential duration limits on
a search-incident-to-arrest.  As its name indicates,
it's incident to the arrest, and this Court's decisions
have described the lowering or reduction of expectation
of privacy of an arrestee as occurring for a reasonable
time and to a reasonable extent after the arrest, then
other Fourth Amendment doctrines kick in.  So to the
extent that most of these searches are going to occur
either at the scene of the arrest --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Once we put in that
limit, you'll just download the phone at the station and
everything, their medical records, their tax returns,
even when they're not relevant to the crime, will be
part of your database.
MR. DREEBEN:  Okay.  Well, that - that is my
last potential limiting principle.  This Court need not
consider in this case the consequences of downloading
the entire contents of a cellphone to a UFED, a
universal forensic extraction device which the briefs
have talked about.  That didn't happen in either of
these cases.  These cases involve manual searches of the
information that's available to the user of the phone.
Once the information has been captured into
an electronic database separately in an extraction
device, there is at least an argument that at that point
the evidence is preserved and potentially the warrant
requirement would have a different application, at least
if the search of that forensic database was going to go
beyond ascertaining identity and verifying officer
safety considerations.
The Court does not need to examine that in
this case.  It may well be that expectations of privacy
do not exist as to information that the user himself can
quickly access on a phone, the kind of thing the police
are likely to look at when they make an arrest because
they are interested in developing evidence that relates
to the crime, protecting their safety and ascertaining
identity.  They are not really interested in going
through all an arrestee's medical records and
photographs and so forth.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Your brief suggested a
limitation with respect to access to the iCloud.
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me how
you tell the difference?
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think that would be
something that officers would have to develop protocols
based on changing technology to address.  We do not
claim here the authority to use the phone to access data
that is not on the phone, in the cloud, and it may well
be that in the future more information will migrate to
the cloud, less will be on the phone, and that may shift
what the officers can actually do.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I thought the whole
ideas of smartphones, Mr. Dreeben, and increasingly so,
was that even the user doesn't know what what's on the
cloud or not.
MR. DREEBEN:  So to the extent that that is
true, Justice Kagan, law enforcement officers, to ensure
they're complying with the Fourth Amendment, would have
to take the phone off the network.  And that is best
practices.  It's discussed in all of the forensic
manuals that we cited to the Court.  You want to take
the phone off the network to avoid the remote wiping
problem, to avoid corruption of data through new data
coming in.  It's sound forensic practice to do that and
it also serves what we think is a limiting principle.
Again, the Court doesn't have to decide that limiting
principle in this case.  There's no claim that any cloud
data was accessed in this case.  We're only saying that
the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine serves a valuable
function, serves a particularly valuable function with
cellphones, because they are so commonly used as the
medium of the commission of crimes.  They are carrying
the same kind of information that the individual
previously would have carried in paper and it seems
somehow a little odd to say that because information has
migrated from paper onto a smartphone that the officers
have a critical need to obtain --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't think it's odd to
say that we're living in a -- in a new world.  Justice
Kagan's questions point out the fact that someone
arrested for a minor crime has their whole existence
exposed on this little device.  From your argument, you
want us just to adopt a categorical rule, it's in the
custody of the police, they can search it.  Do you have
-- do you have any limiting principles that we should
considerate at all as a fallback position?
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, Justice Kennedy, I do.
The first one that I think has been discussed in both
arguments and Justice Scalia has brought it up as well,
is that the evidence to be searched, unless there's some
exigency, should be relevant to the crime of arrest and
the Court can articulate that in a way that would
prevent roving searches or speculative searches.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that -- that was for
an expired license.
MR. DREEBEN:  So I don't think it's
necessarily --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- or is it the guns that
were under the hood in the other case?
MR. DREEBEN:  In the Riley case, the guns
were under the hood and the arresting officers found a
green bandana and some red and white Converse shoes, I
believe.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The crime of arrest was
the expired license.
MR. DREEBEN:  No.  The crime of arrest was
the firearms in Riley.  It was only after they found --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's correct, after the
stop, yes.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- the firearms in the impound
search did they actually conduct the arrest.  And at
that point the ultimate search that occurred was because
there was a known propensity of gang members to document
their use of firearms in pictures.  And so that's what
the arresting officer was looking for.  It's no
different than what he would have looked for on the
arrestee's person in his wallet.  So it wasn't the kind
of cloud-based search, search into health records.  It
was a scope-focused search.
So I think that there are limiting
principles, Justice Kennedy, that you referred to.  One
is when the officer is looking for crime of
arrest-related material and there is evidence that can
be plausibly said is crime of arrest-related material on
the phone, he can look for that.
The Court could couple that, if it wasn't
satisfied that that was a sufficient limitation, with a
scope-based limit which would say that you can't look
everywhere on the phone where there's no realistic
chance that there's going to be evidence related to the
crime of arrest.  You can't just rove through the phone.
You need to keep a scope focus.  And that can be
enforced and would be enforced by defendants, I can
assure you, through post hoc litigation and suppression.
And the police would have to conform their conduct to
the constraints of the Fourth Amendment in conducting
the search.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you mean by scope?  You can look
at e-mails but not something else?  What would the scope
limitation be?
MR. DREEBEN:  It would depend on the crime.
So if you were looking for evidence related to the crime
of possession of child pornography, you could certainly
go through photographs.  If you were looking for another
crime, potentially drug trafficking, you would look for
things like drug ledgers, recent contacts, lists of
customers and not necessarily in videos.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's very hard to
see how that limit would be applied.  You can see and
the police would be able to articulate why almost every
application, every entry in a cellphone would reasonably
be anticipated to have evidence of a particular crime.
Obviously e-mails, obviously call logs.  Even, you know,
Facebook.  I mean, if it's a weapons crime, maybe they've got
pictures of themselves with guns.  I mean, I have
trouble imagining what application, what entry police
could not say it's reasonably likely that there would be
evidence of the crime.
MR. DREEBEN:  So, Mr. Chief Justice, to the
extent that you think that's an inevitable
generalization and there is a certain way of looking at
it in which that's correct, then the interposition of a
warrant requirement would do nothing because the warrant
would say, search the cell phone for evidence related to
drug trafficking and then the phone would be searched in
exactly that manner.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, the point of a warrant is
that a person who is not involved and is objective
listens to what the policeman is saying, knowing that
sometimes, like me or any other human being, a policeman
can get a little carried away.  So if, in fact, he does
show the warrant, that there is this basis, you issue
the warrant.  Many, many -- and if he doesn't you don't.
It isn't because they're different legal questions.
It's just you want that third dispassionate mind to
review what the facts are.
Now, if that's a purpose of having a
warrant, how long does it take to get a warrant in the
mine run of these cases?  Is it not a matter of hours in
most places?
MR. DREEBEN:  It may be in some places and
not in others.
JUSTICE BREYER:  In some places I'm sure
it's difficult.  But I'm saying most places, major
cities, et cetera, my guess was -- and I want to be
corrected if I'm wrong -- it's a matter of a few hours
and you could do it more quickly if you needed to.  Am I
right about that?
MR. DREEBEN:  I don't know that you are,
Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you are in a
department that keeps track pretty much.  You're much
more expert than I.  And therefore I would like your
best guess on the mine run of things of a range of time
to get a warrant.
MR. DREEBEN:  So, Justice Breyer, it varies
considerably in the 50 States and the Federal Government
depending on where you are, the availability of
magistrates, the complexity of the case.  I would
differentiate this from the McNeely case, where the
Court was pretty confident that you could get a warrant
quickly.  The reason that the Court could be pretty
confident about that is drunk driving is a very simple
crime, and the officer has very simple observations in
order to validate it and there are forms that can be
prepared to get a warrant.
With the great -- we're talking now about
every crime for which people are arrested.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I see your point.  I see
your point.
MR. DREEBEN:  And the facts are going to be
more complicated.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Assume a range.  But my
question I'm trying to get to is this.  What, from what
you've said is the harm in saying, yes, you need a
warrant, but remember, there are exigent circumstances?
So where is someone -- the bell rings on the phone.
Depending on the kind of crime, it may be pretty
important to let the policeman answer to find out where
it's coming from, because it may be other people on the
gang who are coming with weapons.  Or alternatively, if
you're right on the technology, it may be someone about
to push a buzzer that will erase the information.
So remember we have the exigent
circumstances.  If your view of the technology is right,
they will perhaps be used with common sense and caution.
But you don't need a special rule other than the rule,
get a warrant.  How will that hurt?
MR. DREEBEN:  That is a special rule for the
search-incident-to-arrest content.  It's -- we've
discussed a variety of special rules, but that rule
completely compromises the interests in search-incident-to-arrest,
because they have always assumed that the
interest in police discovering evidence that could help
them in the prosecution, that could protect their
safety, and that would avoid destruction is paramount
given the reduced expectations of privacy of the
arrestee.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you work with exigent
Circumstances. Why?
MR. DREEBEN:  No.  And this is why I -- I
hope that I can make this clearer, because the encryption
problem is what makes it impossible for the police to be
confident that you can take the time to go and get a
warrant and you won't lose the data forever.  Encryption
kicks in when the phone is turned to a setting that
automatically will occur on most modern cell phones that
turns the phone off and then the phone's contents become
encrypted and that's when you need the password to open
it up.  And if you don't have that password, you're not
going to be able to do it.  And law enforcement's
forensic labs aren't going to be able to get around it
in -- except with extraordinary efforts and
extraordinary time.
So we're not talking about the difference
here between two minutes to get the warrant and looking
at the information.  It may be months if you don't take
advantage of looking at it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you stop it from
going off?
MR. DREEBEN:  Now, it -- I think that one of
the interesting things that Petitioner did in the Riley
case was append to the back of his brief a couple of
pictures of Apple's iPhone 5 on how you could go into
the phone, if the phone is configured in the way that it
was in the pictures that he took, and disable the auto
lock feature.  What Petitioner did not do was provide
similar information for the 500 or so other phones that
are on the market and that will be on the market in the
coming years so that police officers will be equipped
with a manual that will probably be as thick as the New
York City telephone book with the various procedures
that are needed to prevent any phone from going into an
encryption mode and becoming inaccessible.  They don't
know that at the time they seize the phone, Justice
Breyer, and that's why exigent circumstances, unless
it's done as a categorical rule, because I did not know
whether this phone would encrypt, I searched it, unless
you do that, then you are basically putting the officers
at the mercy of technology, which will increasingly be
able to defeat their ability to conduct the kind of
routine searches that they have always conducted in the
past.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they've got
their own technological front in this battle, too, and
that's -- I mean, to the extent there are flaws in the
Faraday bag, I wouldn't be surprised if that's not
improved over the next months or years or whatever.
MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, it's an
arms race between the forensic capabilities of law
enforcement labs and the abilities of cell phone
manufacturers and criminals to devise technologies that
will thwart them.  And they will leapfrog each other at
times and there may be periods when law enforcement has
the advantage and there may be period where -- periods
where those people who want to protect against
revelation of data on the phone will succeed.
And my only point here is that it would not
be a wise rule for this Court to announce, based on
today's technology and reasonable projections of
technology, that the police will just easily be able to
go and get a warrant, because my experience from the
people that I had spoken with is that a lot of phones
are arriving at the lab in a locked and encrypted state
and it's very tough to deal with that.  And if the Court
does have concerns, as many members of the Court have
expressed, about applying, lock stock and barrel, the
traditional Robinson rule, there are weigh stations and
compromise positions.
This case, I think, as California pointed
out, both this case and Riley, don't really involve
totally unpacking somebody's life from their smartphone.
And I'm not suggesting that the Court should resolve
these cases by announcing a rule that's just limited to
the facts of the cases.  But if the Court is looking to
preserve some areas for protection, we've talked about
limiting the justification for a search, limiting the
scope of a search, limiting the duration of a search,
and limiting the intensity in the sense of confining it
to what can be found manually on the phone.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you -- do you see what I
was trying to do with the word "exigency?"  I was trying
to figure out if that's a way of dealing with the
unknown here, which is your problem.  That if, in fact,
technology is such that the policeman, it's really true
if he has five minutes to search, he can get this
valuable evidence and if the technology is such that it
doesn't even give him five minutes, or if it's such that
it gives him four or five hours, or if it's such that he
can press a button, or if it's the opposite and they can
just cough and encrypt it, well, all that will be fed
into the word "exigency," which we wouldn't have to
decide now, but rather, you could make your arguments
about the real exigency for preventing the destruction
later in the context of -- of what turns out to be the
technology of the time.  That's what was going on.
MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, the reason why
Robinson adopted a categorical rule is it concluded that
such case-by-case adjudication for officers in the field
is completely infeasible.  And when balancing the
important law enforcement interests against the reduced
expectations of privacy, Robinson struck a categorical
balance.  Reverting to an exigent circumstances analysis
here would unstabilize all of the law under Robinson.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about a plain view
analysis?  Turn on the phone, see if there's been a
telephone call within a reasonable amount of time of the
arrest or -- or any message that was sent at the time of
arrest.  That's sort of a plain view situation.  It
would take care of your person with the picture of him
or herself with guns.  It would take care of the call to
the confederate.  It would take care of the -- of the
imminent destruction of the phone.
MR. DREEBEN:  So, Justice Sotomayor, I'm not
entirely sure how to articulate that principle, but if
it fits within the crime of arrest plus identity
principle, then I think it would be a reasonable
fallback position.
If I could reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Mizner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH H. MIZNER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. MIZNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I'd like to first talk about the encryption
that we've been discussing.  It's not an issue in this
case.  It was not an issue in Riley.  It was not
litigated below.  And the government has just now said
that there are a lot of phones arriving at a lab in a
locked state, but do we know whether they're in a locked
state because they were locked at the time that they
were seized or did they lock subsequently?
The number of password-protected phones that
are open at the time of arrest is pure speculation.  And
if they're not open at the time of arrest, the
government's argument about locking is irrelevant.  The
number of password-protected phones that would be
inaccessible at a later time is also an unknown and --
and speculative quantity.
There are devices that can break passwords.
Technology advances on both fronts.  The government has
capabilities of breaking the more typical passwords, the
four-digit, four letter passwords within 15 minutes.  There
are -- you can obtain assistance from manufacturers in
obtaining the passwords and ability to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We've -- we've kind
of gotten far afield, which I'm sure is not -- may not
be fair to Mr. Fisher or Mr. Dumont, we're talking about
their case, but in your case why isn't the information
in plain view?  It says, "my house, my home."  They look
at it, that's what they see.  They don't have to open
anything.
MS. MIZNER:  They saw the words "my house."
They did have to open the phone and access the log to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.  But I'm
saying do you have -- you have no objection to the "my
house"?
MS. MIZNER:  The "my house" words were in
plain view.  And under this Court's doctrine, that's
not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I assume that that's
-- it says "my house" because he's done something with
the particular number.  If he didn't, it would be the
number itself that would show up, right?
MS. MIZNER:  Yes.  And that's part --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And so that would
also be in plain view?
MS. MIZNER:  The number was not in plain
view.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  But I mean,
in a -- in a case in which the user had not coded the
particular number, the number would show up, I think,
right?
MS. MIZNER:  Yes.  And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that would be --
MS. MIZNER:  And the number would be in
plain view.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.
MS. MIZNER:  But what makes the -- the
privacy interest and the associational interest in
simply the call logs, which the government has talked
about in Mr. Wurie's case, is that it does contain more
than simply the numbers dialed.  You have the
associational information that's created by the user.
In this case, it was linking my house to a particular
number.
It can go well beyond that.  You can link
names and nicknames to -- and places to a number.  You
can link e-mails to a name and a number.  You can link a
relationship to a name and a number.  Doctor, shrink,
mom, dad.  You can link a photograph to a number.  You
can link your number -- you can link it to text
messages.  You can link it to other numbers.
So you can provide pattern -- and also
patterns of calling that provide additional
associational data and could indicate the closeness of a
relationship.  How often calls were made, when are they
made, what's the time of the call, when did it start or
stop, the length of the call.  You can link notes,
either general or about a particular phone call.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you think,
if the phone rings, can the police answer it?
MS. MIZNER:  The cases that have addressed
answering the phone have been in the context of search
warrants for houses where, as the police are searching
the house, the phone has been ringing.  And the courts
have said that -- lower courts have said that where
answering the phone can be viewed as being within the
scope of the search warrant, it is permissible for the
police to answer the phone.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what about
this case where there isn't a search warrant?
MS. MIZNER:  They didn't answer the phone.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The number's in
plain view.  I mean, is answering the phone -- can you
do it or not?  You know what number is calling.  Is it
like someone -- you're conducting a search on the house
and somebody knocks on the door?  You can open the door,
right?
MS. MIZNER:  Yes.  And they perhaps could
have answered the phone in this case, but they didn't.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, but what is your
position?  What is the rule you want us to adopt in
response to the Chief Justice's question?
MS. MIZNER:  I would say that they could
answer the phone.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under what theory?  I
don't disagree with you.  I just want to know what would
be your theory, and what's the limitation?
MS. MIZNER:  Well, in the sense it's -- it's
plain hearing.  It is a -- an analogue of plain view.
There is nothing particularly private about the ringing.
And if you -- the policeman can answer the phone.  It
doesn't mean that the person on the other end has to
respond.  It's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I was thinking in terms
of reasonable expectation of privacy.  Most people don't
pick up other people's phones to answer them unless the
phone is lost.  And then you pray the person who found
it answers it.
(Laughter.)
MS. MIZNER:  And perhaps this would be
analogous to -- to that.  So the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So do you think --
it's got nothing to do with plain hearing.  I'm not
saying they can't -- obviously they can hear the ring.
I'm just -- it's a big, different step to answer it.
MS. MIZNER:  If the police have seized the
phone and they can secure it, pending application for a
warrant to engage in a search of its contents, then
answering the phone could be viewed as part of -- of
securing.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Does the owner of a cell
phone have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the
call log?
MS. MIZNER:  Yes.  I believe for the
associational data and reasons that I have just
articulated, that there is an expectation of privacy in
the call log.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But the cell phone company
has all that information, doesn't it?
MS. MIZNER:  No.  The cell phone company
has --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Has the numbers.
MS. MIZNER:  -- Has the numbers, but it does
not have --
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Does the -- does
the owner have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a
list of the numbers called?
MS. MIZNER:  Not in the list of the numbers
alone, but the call log is not limited to that list of
numbers.  And your phone bill may not necessarily
include, depending on the kind of plan you have, may not
include information about the length of the call or --
JUSTICE ALITO:  The cell phone company won't
have information about the length of the call?
MS. MIZNER:  I think it would depend on --
whether they keep that information, it would depend on
what kind of plan you have.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what are we dealing
with here?  I know everybody wants to talk about global
issues, but what -- what are the -- what information are
we talking about in this case?  We have my home, which
you said is in plain view, my house, and then you have
the call log.
What else do we have?
MS. MIZNER:  That was all that was accessed.
We're talking about the phone number that allowed the
police to get to a particular premises.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if the call log, the
numbers called, is not covered by a reasonable
expectation of privacy, and my house is not covered by a
reasonable expectation of privacy, then where is the
search?
MS. MIZNER:  It -- the search is in opening
the phone itself, which is covered by a reasonable
expectation of privacy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, they could --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And you couldn’t do that and
look for a razor blade?
MS. MIZNER:  You could -- you are then --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Flip open the old style
flip-phone to see if there's something inside?
MS. MIZNER:  Yes, you could examine it, but
that is not going to get you the phone number.  You had
to push -- the officer here had to push a button in
order to get access to the call logs.  There were two
buttons that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So you have a reason -- but what
is -- where is -- what is the reason -- by pushing the
button, you get information that you just told me is not
covered by a reasonable expectation of privacy.
MS. MIZNER:  No, Justice Alito, I believe I
said that the information is covered by a reasonable
expectation of privacy because there is associational
information that is inputted by the owner of the phone.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes, but was any of that
used here?
MS. MIZNER:  It was the link between my
house and the -- and the number, yes, that -- that got
them to the premises.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, they saw that the number --
they saw the phone rang at a particular time, and then
if you look at the call log, you can see what call came
in at that particular time.  And then you know where the
call came from that registered as my house.
MS. MIZNER:  But you wouldn't know that it
was my house absent the information that the owner of
the phone had put in.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Why -- why is that
so and maybe I don't understand the facts.
If -- if a phone rang right now and you look at the call
log and you see what call came in at 12:13, and you know
that the call came from my house, and you see the number
from -- of the call that came in at 12:13, wouldn't you
know that that was the number from my house?
MS. MIZNER:  But you wouldn't know from the
call log alone without information input by the phone
owner on that log that it was my house once they get the
number.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if it
wasn't -- if it wasn't input, you would have the number
itself in plain view.
MS. MIZNER:  Yes.  But you would then -- you
could go to some kind of reverse directory to get an
address.  But you have no -- what is the reason to
believe that that number --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You wouldn't know it
was the house.
MS. MIZNER:  -- has anything to do with the
defendant's house.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can -- can -- can the
police search the person's wallet and find an -- an
index card with a number, my house?  Can he do that --
MS. MIZNER:  I believe --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- and use the information
obtained?
MS. MIZNER:  I believe that the police can
examine the contents of a --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Examine the contents of
the wallet but not read it?  I -- I don't understand the
issue.
MS. MIZNER:  And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is -- may the police or
may not the police examine a wallet, find the number
that says my house, and act on that information to
investigate the crime?  Yes or no?
MS. MIZNER:  This Court has not addressed
the reading of information examined in -- in -- in
searching for incident to arrest.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it seems to me that
it's fairly clear that it's part of the contents that
are seized, that are on -- in the possession of the
arrestee, and that the police can act on it.
MS. MIZNER:  Well, under the justifications
of Chimel and -- which were reiterated in -- in Robinson
and in Gant and McNeely, the justifications are officer
safety and evidence preservation.  It doesn't -- which
does not necessarily encompass reading.
But to address the case of the cell phone, I
don't think you have to resolve whether it's appropriate
to read paper documents that you come across in
examining a paper or not.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but the point is
the only -- the only information they got and used was
the phone number and address of his house, right?
And -- and that it was his house, right?
MS. MIZNER:  But that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's on your
driver's license, isn't it?  So -- and --
MS. MIZNER:  Your residence is, but this was
not -- then they needed his driver's license, which they
had.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I guess I'm just
trying to see what greater invasion of privacy there was
in this case than the police looking at your driver's
license when you're carrying it around in your wallet.
MS. MIZNER:  Because my house may not
necessarily be the house in which you reside.  You may
have chosen to attach that description --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the problem here
was that he called -- he indicated that a number was his
house, and it might not have been his house?
MS. MIZNER:  The problem is that the police
searched his phone in order to associate information
contained in the phone with what they were able to
observe in plain view.
JUSTICE BREYER:  There had to be two
buttons, two buttons.
MS. MIZNER:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, was there a claim made
in this case that exigent circumstances, destruction of
evidence, or officer safety justified the search?
MS. MIZNER:  No.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No?  Okay.
So I guess that if there is a rule that says you
can search phones, then you could do it.  After all, you
might search a phone and come up with an advertisement
for a Walt Disney movie, which is perfectly public.
But if the rule is you can't search phones,
then you win, even though in this case they came up with
something that was -- is -- is that right or not?
MS. MIZNER:  Yes.  So --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, if, in fact, you
can search the phone thoroughly for everything in the
person's life, they might have come up with something
when he was six years old, there is, in fact, a picture
of an elephant at the zoo.  Totally public.
But it would still fall within the rule,
which what I thought one of the things we're arguing
about in this case.
MS. MIZNER:  Yes, Justice Breyer, and we
believe that the seize-and-secure rule that we are
proposing meets the needs of law enforcement by allowing
them to maintain custody of the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Well, what is
your argument for the proposition, look, when you search
a phone, sometimes what you come up with is perfectly
public information; sometimes what you come up with is
private information.  Now, you want to say the absolute
rule should be no.
But what's your argument, rather than trying
to say sometimes if you get the private information, no;
but if you get the public information, yes, et cetera?
MS. MIZNER:  Because everything is so
intermingled on a cell phone or a tablet or a computer,
you don't know what you're going to be getting when you
push those buttons and start rummaging through the
digital contents of the phone.
JUSTICE ALITO:  In determining whether the
examination of information on a cell phone is --
constitutes a search, what do you think we -- we are
doing?  Are we trying to -- to -- are we answering an
empirical question, what is the reasonable expectation
of privacy of a -- of a person in 2014 who has a cell
phone in his or her -- on his or her person?  Or are we
legislating what we think is a good privacy rule?
MS. MIZNER:  I think the Court is
determining whether or not in 2014 an individual has a
reasonable expectation of privacy against government
intrusion into a device that carries around an
increasingly large percentage of somebody's personal and
private information.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Well, a lot of
that -- part of that is the person must act -- people
must actually have that expectation.  That must be the
expectation of people at large in 2014, that they think
that everything that's on their cell phones is private,
or they think some of the information on the cell phones
is private, or they think nothing on the cell phone is
private.  Where do you think we should look to answer
that question about what people in 2014 think about that
question?
MS. MIZNER:  I think from the fact that
people carry them with them in -- in a pocket or in a
purse, that that exhibits an expectation of privacy.
You don't expect people to be rummaging through your
pockets or -- or through the items you're carrying.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But why is that so?  Cell
phones are different.  I'm not going to say for a --
suggest for a second that there are like things that
existed in the pre-digital area.  But in the pre-digital
era, presumably people didn't have a reasonable
expectation of privacy in papers, letters, things like
that that they had, of photos in a billfold, numbers,
addresses, things that they might -- they might be
carrying on their persons.
MS. MIZNER:  You --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So how do we determine what
the -- what the new expectation of privacy is now?
MS. MIZNER:  I think people did have an
expectation of privacy in those items until --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Then why was it not a search
when -- when you -- you searched the pocket of somebody
who was arrested and you found the address of someplace?
MS. MIZNER:  I believe it is a search,
Justice Alito.  It's a question of whether it is a
search that has been justified by an exception to the
warrant requirement, the -- the scope -- or the
permissible scope of the search incident to arrest.
It's still a search.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  What was the --
why -- how do we determine whether something has --
somebody has a reasonable expectation of privacy in any
category of information that is contained on a cell
phone?
MS. MIZNER:  Because of the
interconnectivity of the data, I don't think you can say
a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in this
app, but not that app, because you don't know what is
linked to any other part of the cell phone.  So the rule
that provides the security that the Fourth Amendment is
intended to give an individual would be to say --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are -- are you -- I --
I -- I'm assuming that what you're saying -- you just
said it a minute ago -- the Fourth Amendment, the
searches incident to arrest are an exception to the
Fourth Amendment?
MS. MIZNER:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And is it your position,
I -- I'm assuming this is what this argument's been
about, which is whether we're going to extend that
exception of -- the exception of searches incident to
arrest to a new category, cell phones --
MS. MIZNER:  Whether --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- which are different
than the traditional item.
MS. MIZNER:  Whether the scope of a
justifiable search-incident-to-arrest is going to
include a search of -- of the cell phone.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why do you say they are an
exception to the Fourth Amendment?  They just don't
violate the Fourth Amendment.  I mean, the Fourth
Amendment covers certain things and it doesn't cover
other things.  The things that it doesn't cover are
not -- not -- not exceptions.  They're just things not
covered.
MS. MIZNER:  Well, this Court has espoused a
warrant presumption and has said -- has classified the
search-incident-to-arrest exigent circumstances as
exceptions to the warrant requirements saying that the
preference is for a warrant to be obtained, and under
certain well-defined circumstances, we are going to say
that you need not.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but that -- that
presumption is -- is simply not -- you don't believe
that presumption, do you?
MS. MIZNER:  I do.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There are many more
searches conducted without a warrant than with a warrant
I -- I bet.  I mean, any automobile search, any
inventory search, any -- any search of -- of businesses.
All sorts of searches are conducted without a warrant.
But you still believe that a warrant is the
rule and everything else is the exception.  I think it
may be the opposite, actually.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Unless the exceptions
have swallowed the rule.
MS. MIZNER:  In the exceptions, viewing the
search-incident-to-arrest exception as having per -- as
having limited parameters as the First Circuit did --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the question is
whether it's an unreasonable search, and the warrant
clause follows much later.  The question is:  Is this an
unreasonable search?
MS. MIZNER:  But this Court has --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's what the
Constitution provides.
MS. MIZNER:  This Court has said in many
instances that a search not conducted pursuant to a
warrant is unreasonable unless it falls within one of
the well-defined exceptions that this Court has
recognized to the warrant requirement.  But --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's a search that's
reasonable.  That's not necessarily an exception.
MS. MIZNER:  But in terms of reasonableness,
this Court is balancing the intrusion against the
individual's interest in privacy --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, and that's the --
MS. MIZNER:  -- a traditional balancing
test, and we suggest that -- that balance here supports
the seize and secure rule that we are advocating.
JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  I understand that.  But
that -- that's the question that I was asking before.
Is it a reasonable search or seizure?  All right.  So
you have to balance the privacy interest versus the law
enforcement interest.
And how do -- how do we find out what the
privacy interests are -- what the privacy expectations
are, which go into that balance with respect to cell
phones in 2014?
MS. MIZNER:  Well, on --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Does it matter?  You think
it doesn't matter?  Maybe people feel very strongly
every single thing that's in the cell phone is -- is
private, or maybe they don't.  Maybe they think some
things are private; some things are not private.
MS. MIZNER:  I think that by virtue of the
fact that you carry them around in a generally enclosed
container, a pocket, a purse, a briefcase, that that
exhibits -- that is an indication that people expect
that the cell phone -- that the information contained on
their cell phone is private.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, as opposed to
what?  Carrying it around somewhere other than your
pocket?  I mean, do -- do you think there's a difference
if it's attached to someone's belt and everybody can see
it or if it's in a pocket?
MS. MIZNER:  No.  I believe that because you
are carrying it with you, it is -- it's not something
that you are exhibiting to the public.  You're not
exhibiting the contents of the phone to the public.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Surely it's more
private if it's locked in your car or kept in your
house.
MS. MIZNER:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Carrying it with you
in public makes it less private.
MS. MIZNER:  But you're not -- it may be
less private, but that doesn't mean that you don't have
a reasonable expectation of privacy against people
taking it from you and starting to intrude and -- and
rummage through its contents.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you’re not questioning
the ability of the police to take the phone.  I thought
that that was a given, that incident to the arrest, the
police could take the phone.  The question is whether
they can search it without a warrant.
MS. MIZNER:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  I was
responding in terms of just a general expectation that
people are not going to -- if you -- because you're
carrying a phone in public, it doesn't mean that you
expect that people are going to walk up and remove it
from your belt or remove it from your pocket and start
searching its contents.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you can say the
same thing about a cigarette pack that -- that has
cocaine in it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or a gun.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or -- or a gun.
MS. MIZNER:  And the police may seize and
examine those containers --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MS. MIZNER:  -- to see whether or not.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And why not the phone.
That's exactly the question.
MS. MIZNER:  Because --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have a reasonable --
our rule has been if you carry it on your person, you
ought to know it is subject to seizure and examination,
and that's been the rule.
MS. MIZNER:  It's the scope of examination
that we -- that is at issue with a cell phone.  A cell
phone is fundamentally different from a cigarette pack.
You can open the cigarette pack, you see whether or not
there is something that is subject to destruction.  But
whether there's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you can open the cell
phone and see whatever's in it.  So if you carry around
a cell phone that isn't encrypted or whatever, you know,
you -- you -- you get what you -- what you should have
expected.  That's -- that's been the rule.  If you are
arrested, we -- we can seize it and examine it.
MS. MIZNER:  The question is what is the
scope of a permissible examination.  And when you're
talking about a cigarette pack, you're looking at
another physical object.  You're not looking at the
contents of somebody's home.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand.  But you --
so you're arguing for a new rule.  The rule right up to
now has been you can -- we can seize it.  We can examine
it totally.  If it's a book, we can read every page of
the book.  You want a new rule for cell phones, right?
MS. MIZNER:  We want a rule that says that
you cannot search the contents of the cell phone without
a warrant.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  At all?  At all?
MS. MIZNER:  On -- absent exigent
circumstances.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What would be an exigent
circumstance where you could search, in your view?
MS. MIZNER:  An exigent circumstance?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said you had -- you
are arguing for a flat rule to the police, thou shalt
not unless there are exigent circumstances.  So what
would be an exigent circumstance where the police,
without getting a warrant, could search the cell phone?
MS. MIZNER:  One would be an example of
police are investigating a bombing, a upcoming -- a
potential bombing, and they have information that the --
that whoever is going to set off the bomb is going to --
may do it with a cell phone, and is going to be in a
particular place at a particular time.  You see someone
approaching with a cell phone, then suggest that under
those circumstances, you could --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is kind of --
MS. MIZNER:  -- take whatever measures you
needed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not a bomb, but
this a different case.  This is somebody in an area
selling drugs where the police have told us they
typically use cell phones to arrange the deals and the
transfers, and this guy is caught with two cell phones.
Why would he have two cell phones?
MS. MIZNER:  Many people have more than --
have multiple cell phones.  I -- there was no --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Really?  What is --
what is your authority for the statement that many
people have multiple cell phones on their person?
MS. MIZNER:  Just observation.  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You've observed different
people from the people that I've observed.
(Laughter.)
MS. MIZNER:  That's probably true.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Particularly since
they're in their pockets, right?
Well, it -- does -- do you -- is it
insignificant, in your view, that the cell phone was a
method for which criminal transactions were typically
undertaken in this area and that the fellow had two cell
phones rather than what I would have thought is the more
normal one?
MS. MIZNER:  Yes.  I don't believe that that
should be a criteria justification for searching either
cell phone.  The -- it may be convenient for the police
to get information related to a crime by -- by searching
without a warrant, but this Court has said repeatedly
that convenience and efficiency don't override
individual constitutional rights.
And sanctioning a general evidence gathering
search of the entire contents of his cell phone, given
the current expansive nature of those contents is an
unwarranted expansion of a traditional search incident
to arrest, because we are not talking about the kind of
traditional containers that holds limited, finite
quantities of -- of usually other objects.
And there is nothing -- a seize-and-secure
rule protects both the individuals' expectations of
privacy and security and the government's right to
obtain evidence consonant with the protections of the
warrant requirement, giving the neutral magistrate an
opportunity to determine whether there's probable cause
for the search of the cell phone and to define the
limits of that search.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Dreeben, you
have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
A search incident to arrest has always been
considered a reasonable search within the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment, and I think this case illustrates why
that principle well applies to a cell phone.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is a very big
confusion of the Fourth Amendment.  The Fourth Amendment
doesn't permit reasonable searches without a warrant.
It says you need a warrant for -- we've created
exceptions to that, but not because a search is
reasonable.  Virtually every search could be reasonable
without a warrant.  If you've watched somebody selling
drugs, it's very reasonable to go into their house, but
absent the exigent circumstance of the drugs
disappearing, you can't.  So I don't talk about
reasonable searches.  I talk about --
MR. DREEBEN:  So Justice Sotomayor, the
Fourth Amendment doesn't actually say you do need a
warrant.  It does protect the right against unreasonable
seizures, and it describes what warrants must contain.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the only thing it
prohibits is unreasonable seizures.
MR. DREEBEN:  That's exactly right.  That's
the textual prohibition.  This Court has created
language in its jurisprudence that prefers warrants in
certain circumstances, but as the Court recognized in
McNealey last term and in Maryland v. King, the search
incident to arrest doctrine is a categorical exception
and this case illustrates why.
The information that was found on the phone
was very time sensitive and important to law
enforcement.  It helped fulfill the typical purposes,
the categorical purposes of the search incident to
arrest doctrine.  It helped verify identity, it helped
solve the crime that -- for which the individual was
arrested, and it was done in a reasonable and
nonintrusive manner.  There was nothing about this
search that exposed reams of private data to view.
To the extent that the data was not in a
call log really subject to a reasonable expectation of
privacy at all, it was discovered in a search but I
think that underscores why the search was limited and
reasonable.  So this case really, I think, exemplifies
why a categorical rule that respondent urges in this
case would not be appropriate, and we submit that this
Court should reverse the Court of Appeals.  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
Mr. Dreeben.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:34 p.m., the case in the
