CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear argument

Defense Council. General Garre.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL GARRE: Thank you, Mr.
Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The ability to locate and track an enemy
submarine through the use of mid-frequency active sonar
is vitally important to the survival of our naval strike
groups deployed around the world and therefore critical
to the nation's own security. In this case the Ninth
Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction that places
serious restrictions on the Navy's use of MFA sonar in
training exercises that in the judgment of the President
and his top naval officers are in the paramount
interests of the United States. That injunction is
fundamentally flawed for three principal reasons.
First, it is based on an erroneous
assessment of the likelihood of success on Respondent's
NEPA claim. Second it is based on an erroneous
conception of the showing of irreparable injury
necessary to secure what this Court has aptly called
"the extraordinary and dramatic remedy" of a preliminary
injunction. And finally, it fails to take account the
vital public interests in conducting the training
exercises at issue unencumbered by the injunction's
restrictions.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Garre, when you
address the injunction, do you mean the injunction as
originally ordered by the district court or are you
taking account of the modification made by the Ninth
Circuit, and would you say that the three points you
just made would apply as well to the injunction as
modified?
GENERAL GARRE: Certainly we would,
Justice Ginsburg. Obviously our position on the NEPA
claim is the same with respect to any aspect of the
injunction. So too with the risk of irreparable harm
which we think Respondents haven't shown. The Ninth
Circuit did modify the injunction by issuing a partial
stay. It's important to keep in mind that its
modifications were tied only to a stay. It didn't
actually modify the injunction. So even if this Court
thought those modifications were appropriate, it would
have to vacate the Ninth Circuit decision.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Say it again? I'm not sure
I --
GENERAL GARRE: The Ninth Circuit framed its
modifications in terms of a partial stay of its decision
affirming the district court's preliminary injunction.
That stay and therefore those modifications remained in
effect only until this Court issued its decision in this
case.
stay pend
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
GENERAL GARRE: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
ing certiorari, right?
That's the temporary
I think what
Justice Ginsburg was talking about -- and she can
correct me if I am wrong -- were the modifications from
the initial preliminary injunction and the modified
preliminary injunction.
GENERAL GARRE: Well, yes, we are here
complaining about the restriction on the 2200-yard
shutdown requirement, where if a marine mammal comes
within 2200 yards of a naval vessel part of one of these
strike groups it has to shut down sonar operations, as
well as the 75 percent powerdown requirement when
significant surface ducting conditions are present
regardless of the presence of marine mammals.
JUSTICE ALITO: You mentioned the effect on
naval operations. On the other side, could you say what
the record shows about the number of marine mammals that
are likely to be killed or receive actual physical
injury if the -- as opposed to some sort of behavioral
modification, if the injunction is allowed to continue?
GENERAL GARRE: The record -- and here I'm
referring to the environmental assessment and the
opinion of the National Marine Fisheries Services in the
petition appendix and the joint appendix -- indicates
that no marine mammal will be killed as a result of
these exercises. The environmental assessment predicted
there would be eight instances of injurious harm. These
eight instances would take place only with respect to a
common species of dolphins of which there are hundreds
of thousands in the Southern California Operating Area.
Now, the environmental assessment also
predicted that there would be a much greater number,
0,000 over the course of two years, of so-called Level
B takes. These are temporary and by definition
non-injurious disturbances and that's made clear at
pages 258a of the petition appendix and page 175 of the
JA, which make clear that these Level B disturbances,
the vast majority of the disturbances predicted by the
environmental assessment, are temporary and
non-injurious.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Just as to dolphins?
GENERAL GARRE: The vast majority of those
disturbances, some almost 90 percent, pertain only to
dolphins.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And what percentage is
that of the total population in the area?
GENERAL GARRE: Well, I think that the
statistics I have indicate that there are more than I
think 500,000 dolphins on the western coast there. As
to -- the number may be actually a little bit lower in
the Southern California Operating Area. But this is --
no one suggests that is in any way a threatened species.
With respect to the species that are
endangered, threatened, or even strategic under the
Marine Mammal Protection Act, the National Marine
Fisheries Services concluded there would be no adverse
harm on the population level or with respect to annual
recruitment rates with respect to those endangered or
threatened species in the biological opinion that the
district court sustained and that Respondents are not
challenging on appeal.
The focus of their claim of irreparable
injury -- and keep in mind that that environmental
assessment comes against the backdrop of a 40-year
history of the Navy's use of MFA sonar in the Southern
California Operating Area at the same frequency and, if
anything, during more frequent training exercises than
have been conducted in recent years.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't mention the
4 exposures that were typed Level A in the
environmental assessment.
GENERAL GARRE: With respect to beaked
whales, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. Those
disturbances are temporary, non-injurious disturbances.
That's important. Let me give you the page cites to the
record on that because it's an important point. JA 178
to 180, JA 185 to 188, and JA 198 to 200 discuss each
species of the beaked whales and explain that the harms
that are predicted in the environmental assessment are
non-injurious, temporary harms.
Now as a policy matter --
JUSTICE ALITO: In lay terms, what does that
mean? Does it mean an alteration of their swimming
pattern, their migration pattern? What does it mean?
GENERAL GARRE: In most cases it means that
there's an alerting response, they hear the sound and
they go in the opposite direction, as one who hears a
noise that disturbs them would ordinarily do. It can
also mean that they could have some temporary effect on
their feeding or breeding patterns, but it's a temporary
effect.
JUSTICE ALITO: It doesn't necessarily mean
that there's a physical injury to them, does it?
GENERAL GARRE: No.
JUSTICE ALITO: It means that they may just
swim in a different direction.
GENERAL GARRE: That's right. By definition
only a Level A take involves an injurious harm, that is
a physical harm which results in permanent damage to
tissue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the 564 number
was Level A, which I also thought meant exposure
resulting in severe harm.
GENERAL GARRE: It is confusing,
Justice Ginsburg. The Navy as a policy matter described
for purposes of the environmental assessment the Level B
takes with respect to beaked whales as Level A takes
because the Navy acknowledged that there is uncertainty
about the effects of sonar on beaked whales. But when
you look at what the environmental assessment says as to
the actual injuries that the National Marine Fish and
Wildlife Service and the Navy predicted based on the
best science available to them and to us today, they are
non-injurious, temporary exposures, and that is made
clear at the portions of the JA that I mentioned.
Now, the Navy -- there is nothing that
prevents an agency from characterizing the particular
harm one way or the other as a policy matter for
purposes of an environmental assessment.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question,
Mr. Solicitor General. Is it understood, though, that
there is a duty to prepare an environmental impact
statement?
GENERAL GARRE: Yes, there is, because we're
not here arguing that, at this point, that we had no
duty to prepare an environmental impact statement
because of the intervening event of the Council for
Environmental Quality's emergency circumstances
alternative arrangements determination. That's the
pertinent administrative event for purposes of
Respondent's claim.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me follow that.
You concede that you have to prepare an EIS in light of
the CEQ's emergency circumstances?
GENERAL GARRE: Yes, it's one of the
alternative arrangements that the Navy agreed to, is
that the environmental impact statement which has been
under way will be completed by January 2009 with respect
to all activities in the Southern California Operating
Area. Now, that's not to say that we concede that an
environmental impact statement was not required -- was
required at the outset. The Navy doesn't concede that.
It litigated this case up to the point of the Council
for Environmental Quality's determination.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why didn't you -- I
mean, you emphasize the level of detail and
comprehensiveness of the environmental assessment that
the Navy prepared. Why didn't you just make -- why
didn't you just go ahead and do an EIS from the outset
if you were going to engage in such effort with respect
to the environmental assessment?
GENERAL GARRE: Because the Navy devoted its
best resources to this and in good faith, as is indicate
bide the 293-page environmental assessment, concluded
that there would not be a finding of significant
environmental impact, and at that point everyone agrees
an environmental impact statement is not required.
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you have to do it.
Given all your work so far, how long would it take? You
had several months already, so how long? When could you
do it by?
GENERAL GARRE: It's going to be completed
by January 2009, Justice Breyer, under the alternative
arrangements that have been approved --
JUSTICE BREYER: So we're talking about two
months.
GENERAL GARRE: Well, at this point we are.
The point that the Navy faced in January of 2008, where
it had an injunction against its use of sonar in these
training exercises and only an environmental impact
statement, it faced, as the Council of Environmental
Quality found, emergency circumstances in terms of the
need to conduct these training exercises.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it that you're are
here because you find the decision of the Ninth Circuit,
and I take it of the district court, prejudicial for the
government on an ongoing basis; and what are the
principal reasons for that?
GENERAL GARRE: Because of its impact on
national security, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what particular
errors? The standard for review -- pardon me. The
standard for the grant or denial of injunction? What
are the principal areas you want to present to us?
GENERAL GARRE: I think there are three
fundamental flaws, as I indicated. One, we think the
Ninth Circuit just got the NEPA claim wrong. The Navy
is complying with NEPA through the alternative
arrangements and the regulations, but the CEQ found --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Where was the statutory
authority suspending the obligation to provide an EIS?
You mentioned a regulation. Where in the statute does
it say that the Council on Environmental Quality can
dispense with this requirement?
GENERAL GARRE: I think we would point to a
couple of things. First, in terms of the statute, NEPA
says that the obligations of the statute should be
complied with to the fullest extent. And it doesn't
specifically say what happens if they are not followed.
These are procedural requirements. Secondly --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that's not the
question I am asking. I am not asking about the
consequences of not complying. I am asking what is the
statutory authority for the Council on Environmental
Quality to dispense with the statutory obligation to
prepare it?
GENERAL GARRE: Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's what -- as I
understand it, that's what you're arguing in effect, as
an intervening -- as of intervening legal significance.
And I want to know what the statutory authority is for
that. I don't see it in NEPA.
GENERAL GARRE: The statutory authority that
we find in NEPA for the CEQ's regulation providing for
alternative arrangements is -- first, it's acknowledged
by this Court that CEQ has rulemaking authority. The
Court acknowledged that in Department of Transportation
v. Public Citizen. So we take that as a given.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. As a general
proposition that's fine, but what's the statutory
authority for them to engage in rulemaking authority
that dispenses with the government's obligation to
comply with an EIS requirement?
GENERAL GARRE: Well, let me -- I'll answer
the question, but let me be clear: The government's
position is that we are complying with NEPA by -- by
complying with the alternative arrangements provided by
the Council on Environmental Quality.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- I mean, the
claim is that you weren't complying with it at the time
the request for an injunction was brought, and
everything else is consequent on that. So I want to go
back to the point, in effect, at which the claim was
made that the government is not complying. One of your
answers to that is right now, as a result of subsequent
Council on Environmental Quality action, we're not in
the same situation that we were in when the suit was
brought. And I want to know what the statutory
authority is for the Council on Environmental Quality to
take the action with the effect that you claim it has.
GENERAL GARRE: And I would point, Your
Honor, to the language in NEPA that says it should be
complied with to the fullest extent possible --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That --
GENERAL GARRE: -- and I would --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- seems to cut against
you. I am not getting it.
GENERAL GARRE: Well, that language, coupled
with -- which seems to us to suggest that compliance to
the fullest extent possible would depend on the
circumstances, coupled with the fact that NEPA doesn't
impose, doesn't say what the consequences of
noncompliance would be --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but --
GENERAL GARRE: -- but other --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But why -- I don't
know if this is Justice Souter's question, but why CEQ?
I mean, NEPA doesn't really give anybody any regulatory
authority -- EPA, CEQ. And it seems to me that CEQ is
an odd entity to be doing this. They're more or less an
office in the White House, rather than a free-standing
agency.
GENERAL GARRE: Well, this Court has
acknowledged in numerous cases, Methow Valley and in the
Public Citizen case a few years ago, that NEPA gives CEQ
rulemaking authority, and that this Court gives
substantial deference to the CEQ's rules.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Rulemaking to do what?
To set up an orderly regime for Federal agencies to
carry out their obligations under NEPA?
GENERAL GARRE: To implement the statute,
that's right. And there are a number of important
procedural requirements that go far beyond what the
statute requires that the CEQ has laid out in its
regulations. One of the regulations -- and this has
been on the books since 1979 and has been implemented
some 40 times. So this isn't something that was made up
in this case. It's an established regulatory practice
under NEPA that where there are emergency circumstances
an agency can come up with alternative arrangements to
comply with its NEPA obligations. And here those
alternative arrangements were: One, to complete an EIS
that is under way for all sonar activities and all other
activities by the Navy in the Southern California
operating area by January 2009. The Navy is going to
meet that goal. Two, to adopt the mitigation measures
spelled out in the alternative arrangements. Three, to
provide for public participation so that there could be
comment on any concerns to marine mammals in the area.
And four, to provide for research into harms to marine
mammals. These were significant arrangements that the
Navy agreed to.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what good is it if,
as I understand it, the whole training program will be
over in December, and then the environmental impact
statement, which was supposed to come first, is going to
come after the whole project is concluded?
GENERAL GARRE: Well, it has -- it's
important because the environmental impact statement
that's going to be completed pertains not only to
COMPTUEX and JTF exercises that will be completed in the
Southern California Operating Area in the future, but
all activities. So that environmental impact statement
is going to be very meaningful.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me switch
back. Chief?
Let me switch back in time for a second to
the beginning of these exercises. One of the -- I mean,
one of the arguments, and you have alluded to it, for I
guess the appropriateness of the Council on
Environmental Quality's action, if it has any power to
act, is emergency circumstances. My understanding, and
correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, is that the
exercises began in February of 2007. My understanding
is that it was in that same month of February 2007 that
the Navy produced the EA, the environmental assessment,
so that in effect, as I understand it, the Navy
disclosed the fact that it would not provide an EIS at
just about the same moment that it began the exercises.
GENERAL GARRE: I think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And I guess my question is,
to the extent that there was an emergency, wasn't the
emergency created by the failure of the Navy to take any
timely action? I am assuming in my question that the
Navy had decided before February 1st, 2007, that it was
going to have these exercises. So it sounds to me as
though that, if there is an emergency, it's one that the
Navy created simply by failing to start an EIS
preparation in a timely way at which it tried in effect
to sort of neutralize by keeping everybody in the dark
until the last moment. So, why -- why shouldn't we say
that -- even assuming the Council on Environmental
Quality can somehow dispense with the statute, why
shouldn't we say that there was no emergency here except
one which was created by the Navy's apparently
deliberate inattention?
GENERAL GARRE: For several reasons,
Justice Souter. First, there was a gap between when the
Navy issued its environmental assessment and when the
first training exercises began.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it was a gap of less
than month, right?
GENERAL GARRE: I believe -- I believe
that's right, but there was a gap and there's no -- I
don't think there can be any --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And how long does it -- how
long does it take -- going back to Justice Breyer's
question, how long does it take to prepare an
environmental impact statement? It takes more than --
GENERAL GARRE: Well, I --
JUSTICE SOUTER: It takes more than a month,
doesn't it.
GENERAL GARRE: Sure. Absolutely.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
GENERAL GARRE: But I don't think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And the Navy knew more than
the 1st -- earlier than the 1st of February that it was
going to engage in these exercises, didn't it?
GENERAL GARRE: It did, and it also knew
that it was in the process of finalizing an
environmental impact statement that it prepared in good
faith, a 293-page statement, which concluded that there
would be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: An environmental
assessment.
GENERAL GARRE: An environmental assessment,
that's right, with the finding of no significant
environmental impact.
This Court presumes the regularity of
administrative actions. There's no reason for the Navy,
particularly on this record, to have assumed that that
EA would not have been sustained. The emergency
circumstances arose in January 2008, when the district
court enjoined the use of MFA sonar in these exercises
when the Navy had several exercises.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but they wouldn't
have been in the situation in January of 2008 if they
hadn't been in the situation I described in February of
07. And it sounds to me as though the Navy played its
cards very close to its vest --
GENERAL GARRE: Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in 2007.
GENERAL GARRE: Well, with respect, I don't
think that a 293-page environmental assessment with the
kind of detail and support that this assessment has --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Look, the problem you face
-- and maybe you're being whipsawed -- is that you are
effectively estopped from the argument that no EIS is
necessary by the fact that you have agreed to these
alternative arrangements. But you should not be
estopped from arguing that at the time the EA was issued
that was not a good faith completion of all the Navy's
responsibilities. And that's the argument that is being
made against you now. It assumes that the EA wasn't
enough. And I'm not sure that we -- that that
assumption is valid.
GENERAL GARRE: Well, that's right. And as
I indicated earlier -- I want to be clear -- the Navy
believes that its environmental assessment was not only
prepared in good faith, but was appropriate and reached
the right conclusions.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what
Justice Kennedy started to ask. I mean, I said why
doesn't this thing go away after two months. I mean,
you've done it anyway, and Justice Kennedy said because
you want a holding from the Court that will help you in
other cases because you think what the court below did
here was wrong. And you said "three reasons," and you
got out the first one, and I would like to hear the
other two.
GENERAL GARRE: The other two are: One, the
injunction. Even if you agree with Respondents on the
likelihood of success of the NEPA claim, it's based on a
showing of irreparable injury that is fundamentally
flawed. The Ninth Circuit and the district court looked
to whether there was irreparable injury under a
possibility standard.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Didn't both the circuit and
the district court, although they mentioned that, in
fact find that it was -- I forget what their phrase was
-- beyond question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Near -- "near certainty."
JUSTICE SOUTER: "Near certainty."
GENERAL GARRE: They did, Justice Souter,
and we think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: There is no -- there is no
harm. I mean, the standard may or may not be bright,
but there is no harm to the Navy in this case from --
from the use of that standard, I take it.
GENERAL GARRE: Well, I don't think that a
court could say that, Justice Souter, for a couple of
reasons.
First, when a lower court applies a
fundamentally wrong standard to assess -- to make a
determination, this Court usually corrects that legal
standard and gives the -- the lower court an opportunity
to do it again.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we -- we may, but so
far as the case is concerned we may -- and we frequently
do -- say there -- there -- that certainly there's no
harm in this case, the error was harmless.
GENERAL GARRE: And, two, the finding, which
is a sentence in the district court decision repeated by
the court of appeals, of "near certainty of harm to
marine mammals" is utterly belied by the environmental
assessment in this case as well as the fact that -- and
the Ninth Circuit acknowledged this -- the Navy has been
using MFA sonar in the Southern California Operating
Area for more than 40 years and no one can point to any
harm to marine mammals.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Garre, could I ask you
a question?
GENERAL GARRE: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: If this were not a Navy
case with all of the implications of the Navy, but an
ordinary case in which it was demonstrated that an EIS
had to be filed, would it not be normal -- normal action
to enjoin the -- the government action until the EIS was
filed? Because the -- the very fact that you need an
EIS is -- is because you don't know what environmental
consequences may ensue. That's the purpose of the EIS.
So isn't it the normal practice to enjoin government
action until the EIS is filed when it is clear there is
a duty to file?
GENERAL GARRE: I don't think it is,
Justice Stevens. I think it is -- the normal practice
is to require someone who seeks the extraordinary remedy
of a preliminary injunction to show irreparable injury,
a likelihood of irreparable injury.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would the irreparable
injury have to -- and this just repeats
Justice Stevens's question. It is the same concern I
have.
Let's assume an EIS is required; let's
assume it hasn't been prepared; let's assume the
government project is going to proceed. You still have
to show irreparable harm before you can get the
injunction?
GENERAL GARRE: You do.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have authority for
that in the -- are the circuits unanimous on that point?
GENERAL GARRE: Well, I don't have authority
for that precise proposition because I don't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, yes, you do, but it
may not be in the circuits. Our cases say that
procedural injury alone is not the kind of injury that
confers standing; that there has to be some concrete
harm.
GENERAL GARRE: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the only injury
that -- that follows from the mere failure to file an
EIS is -- is a procedural injury that affects the entire
population.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then, let's -- let's
assume standing. Let's assume standing. Let's -- let's
assume people have standing.
GENERAL GARRE: I -- I think that that's
right, Judge Scalia.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I wouldn't -- look,
you have an EIS for the reason that the agency itself,
once it reads it, might decide to do something else.
That's the whole point of an EIS. So if the agency goes
ahead with the action before reading the EIS, it becomes
committed to that course of action, and the chances that
the EIS will lead it to back up are the same as the
chances that any big agency will back up once it's
committed to a course, namely a lot lower. And that I
always thought was the whole harm that the EIS is there
to stop.
GENERAL GARRE: Clearly, the purpose of the
requirements under NEPA are to ensure that the agency
has -- is making an informed decision, and here I don't
think there is any question that the Navy was after its
3-page assessment.
I am not aware of any --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But that -- in effect, you
are saying the EA is the equivalent to an EIS.
GENERAL GARRE: No, I'm not, Justice Souter.
I am saying --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What is the difference
between them? I -- I assume the difference is the EIS
is a more comprehensive survey and -- and set of
conclusions.
GENERAL GARRE: That's right, but then --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So that without the EIS,
the Navy is acting in -- in a state of -- of some degree
of ignorance greater than would be the case if -- if it
had done -- done the EIS.
GENERAL GARRE: I -- the EIS --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And that, I presume, is the
harm that the -- that the statute is intended to
prevent.
GENERAL GARRE: But it is not a likely --
they have not shown a likelihood of irreparable injury.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The EA demonstrates in your
view that the EIS would -- would very likely say that
this -- this action by the Navy is okay. And since that
is the case, there is -- there is no probability of
irreparable harm; to the contrary, there is the
probability of no irreparable harm because of the EA.
GENERAL GARRE: Well, we agree with that.
We think it's important, though, to separate out the
likelihood of success on the NEPA claim with the
distinct question of whether there is irreparable injury
and look to the record of whether there is irreparable
injury. And we think they have not come close to
establishing that. The one final --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any authorities
in the circuits which would indicate that irreparable
injury is not required when there's standing, when an
EIS is required, when an EIS has not been prepared, and
when the government is ready to proceed? There is
always irreparable injury before you can get an
injunction? That's what all the circuits say?
GENERAL GARRE: Justice Kennedy, I haven't
completed that -- that research with respect to all of
the circuits, but I am confident in saying I am not
aware of a decision in which a court has said that the
irreparable injury requirement does not have to be met
or is automatically met.
JUSTICE STEVENS: The whole theory of the --
of the environmental impact statement is that we don't
really know what the harm will be. So how can you say
that in order to get an injunction against the
government action you have to prove irreparable harm?
GENERAL GARRE: And it may be easier in some
cases than others, Justice Stevens. But I think in this
case where you have the record that has been compiled,
they cannot -- they cannot --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But you're really arguing
that an -- that a temporary statement is enough, will
always be enough.
GENERAL GARRE: We're not taking that
position, Justice Stevens. We're taking the position
that the record in this case does not show a likelihood
of irreparable injury.
JUSTICE SCALIA: In all -- in all of these
cases it is controverted, or in most of them, whether an
EIS is either necessary -- is even necessary. So if the
mere allegation that it was necessary gives rise to an
allegation of irreparable harm, you are going to get a
preliminary injunction in all cases?
GENERAL GARRE: I think that's right. I
think that fundamentally --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that you were
not suggesting --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But there is a finding
that it is necessary, and here we have that finding as I
understand it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you are not
suggesting that -- that there is a probability of
success on the claim that you had to file an
environmental impact statement.
GENERAL GARRE: We -- we are contesting
that. And if I could reserve the remainder of my time.
And one must -- I can explain, if you would like,
Justice.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I thought you
conceded that point.
GENERAL GARRE: If I misspoke, I apologize.
My point was that the administrative determination that
is at issue now in evaluating the NEPA claim is the
finding of alternative arrangements. The Navy has never
conceded that it was required to do an EIS at the
outset. It simply has agreed to live with the

Environmental Quality.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
GENERAL GARRE: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kendall.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. KENDALL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KENDALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The fundamental question in this case is a
very traditional question of equity jurisprudence. The
fundamental question is whether the district court's
factual finding that the injunction will permit the Navy
to train and certify its sailors is supported by the
evidence. Because if it is supported by the evidence it
cannot be clearly erroneous. And if it is not clearly
erroneous, it cannot be reversed.
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there something
incredibly odd about a single district judge making a
determination on that defense question that is contrary
to the determination that the Navy has made?
MR. KENDALL: Justice Alito, I submit not,
and here is why. This was an issue of fact. The
question was whether, in light of the Navy's past
training, which was abundantly shown in the record,
their post-complaint, during the litigation, lawyer-
crafted declarations were sufficiently persuasive to
undo all that evidence that showed that the Navy had
repeatedly used safety zones.
Now, what happened here was that the judge
was extraordinarily deferential to the Navy. The judge
rejected most of the measures that plaintiffs sought,
crediting where the evidence was not to the contrary the
declarations of the Navy saying, for example, we need to
train at night.
JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't see evidence to
the contrary on two important points. The first was
that the Navy had affidavits which says -- they say -- I
read them. Maybe I just missed the contrary. But they
said that: You are requiring us, judge, to turn the
sonar down to six decibels or up to six, whatever,
whenever we had to run into a situation called layering
of different temperature levels. And we tell you, as
naval officers, that that's just where submarines like
to hide. And we also tell you that if we can't train
people to do that they will miss out on an important
part of how to find these submarines.
I saw no answer to that.
The second thing they said was that: We're
willing to turn off the sonar if there's any marine
mammal that comes within 500 yards, which is a quarter
of a mile, about. But you insist that we turn off the
sonar when any animal comes within a mile and a quarter.
And that's quite a big distance more. A lot of animals
come in there, and if we have to turn off the sonar all
those times, we are not going to be able to get much
training done.
Now, those two things seem to be quite
important. And I just might have missed, which I might
have, which is why I'm asking, what the response was by
equivalent experts to those points.
MR. KENDALL: Justice Breyer, the response
in the record appears in the after-action reports of the
eight prior exercises in Southern California. There
were four from the series that we challenge and four
after-action reports, prepared earlier ones. And you
will find those in the joint appendix at 326 to -45.
What the court found was that the Navy had
trained and certified its troops during those eight
SOCAL exercises despite the complete absence of surface
ducting conditions. And it was conceded --
JUSTICE BREYER: What do you mean, despite
the complete absence?
MR. KENDALL: Because surface ducting
conditions are, as it happens, quite rare.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the whole point.
That's why I thought they didn't prove anything. Fine,
they went on some exercises and they didn't run into
these layered things. So obviously they couldn't have
training.
MR. KENDALL: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what they are saying
is, when you do run into that situation you've got to
train people to deal with it. It doesn't prove much
that when you didn't run into it they didn't train
people to deal with it. How could they have?
MR. KENDALL: Well, the question before the
court was balancing the requirement that the Navy comply
with the law and the environmental harms against the
Navy's interest. And our point --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, with one
important qualification. The question was the balance
of those equities on a preliminary basis. In other
words, before we reach a final decision, we're going to
prevent the Navy from engaging in the sonar exercises
that they think are necessary. Not even after we have
decided they were wrong, just because we think there is
a likelihood that they might be wrong.
MR. KENDALL: That's quite right. And of
course, in this litigation that was the whole ball game,
because by the time you had reached trial in this case
all of the exercises --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought that
would have been the whole ball game until I read your
brief. Your brief does not spend a page defending the
decision on the merits of the lower courts. Nothing
about emergency circumstances or CEQ. Instead, you
raise other arguments on which the district court did
not rely in finding likelihood of success. So given
that, I would have thought we would have a lot more to
talk about when it gets to the permanent injunction on
the merits.
MR. KENDALL: I respectfully disagree. We
took the position from the beginning --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, yes, yes. You
certainly raised those issues. I'm not saying that.
What I am saying the district court didn't rely on those
in finding likelihood of success.
MR. KENDALL: Well, I also disagree on that
point. You will find at page 97a of the appendix that
was submitted with the petition for certiorari the
court's declaration that there was no emergency. You
will find --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.
MR. KENDALL: But that's the question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what the
district court relied on. Where in your brief do I see
a defense of the district court's analysis, as opposed
to the very coherent argument about Hayburn's case and
everything else, issues the district court didn't reach?
MR. KENDALL: The district court did reach
the question of whether the Navy could train. That
negated any emergency under any definition of the term.
It doesn't matter whether -- and there was debate about
this below -- an emergency can be foreseeable and
expected, as Justice Souter was -- his questions were
probing, or whether the emergency can be -- must be
unexpected. There was debate about that below. But the
position that we took and the position that the district
court took was there is no emergency.
The reason there is no emergency is because
the Navy -- the Navy is perfectly able to train under
these circumstances.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I can't --
look, I don't know anything about this. I'm not a naval
officer. But if I see an admiral come along with an
affidavit that says -- on its face it's plausible --
that you've got to train people when there are these
layers, all right, or there will be subs hiding there
with all kinds of terrible weapons, and he swears that
under oath. And I see on the other side a district
judge who just says, you're wrong, I then have to look
to see what the basis is, because I know that district
judge doesn't know about it, either.
So, the basis so far I'm thinking on this
one is zero. That's -- because what you have told me is
they completed some exercise where they didn't find any
layering.
MR. KENDALL: There was also prior exercise
in Hawaii. You will recall from the brief that we had a
prior litigation that resulted in the consent decree in
Hawaii. In that consent decree the Navy agreed to train
with a surface ducting powerdown. So, they had
previously told the same judge that they were capable of
training in surface ducting conditions with that
powerdown, else they would not have agreed to that
decree. There was evidence in the record.
The problem that the judge had is that the
Navy cannot be judge of its own cause. Deference does
have its limits. And this judge was in a position of
reviewing facts of prior exercises and what the Navy --
JUSTICE BREYER: Generalities. You see --
of course, I agree with you as a generality. What I am
missing here is the specifics, because I am nervous
about it, as you can see. And what I am nervous about
is that there just wasn't enough on the other side, on
your side.
MR. KENDALL: If I may proceed then to the
safety zone specifics, because that's the other issue.
Remember there were a number of injunctive measures that
the Navy objected to in the district court that they no
longer object to. They ceased to object to them in the
court of appeals and they haven't brought them up here.
So the next issue is the 2200-yard safety
zone. Now, first, why was the safety zone chosen? It
was chosen because that is the Navy's preferred method
of mitigation. They have always mitigated using safety
zones. They have preferred to mitigate using a safety
zone that is 1,000 yards. We asked for one that was
,200 yards.
The question was, what is the difference in
training capability in the two zones? So we looked at
that. And where did we look? We looked at the
statistics from the after-action reports.
Now, in this case we had helpful information
to use, because the after-action reports reveal that the
effect of widening the safety zone would have been at
most one more shutdown or powerdown each exercise.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would have
increased exponentially the area that the Navy had to
scrutinize to determine if there were marine mammals
there.
MR. KENDALL: Incorrect. Incorrect. It
would --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the
increase -- you keep saying it's just 1,000 yards. But
it's 1,000 yards of circle. And if I remember high
school geometry right, that's a squared increase.
MR. KENDALL: But think about how this is
being done. The way it's being done is that you have
somebody on the deck with binoculars and they are
looking straight ahead and they can either look out
,000 yards or out 2,000 yards.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And there are people
in airplanes?
MR. KENDALL: Yes. Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not just straight
ahead.
MR. KENDALL: There are people in airplanes
and they are looking down and they can see as much as
they can see within that area. And if they see a marine
mammal, there will be a shutdown or a powerdown; and if
they don't see it, there won't be one. You can only
shut down or power down when you see one.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my question
was, that increases the area exponentially that has to
be scrutinized. And I don't see why, as you said, that
was wrong.
MR. KENDALL: Because they argued -- and
perhaps I misunderstood, Mr. Chief Justice, that you
were referring to their argument -- which is not that
the area was exponentially larger and that creates
difficulties of observation; they argued it would create
an exponentially greater number of shutdowns. And that
is mathematically proven false by the after-action
reports, because it's one per exercise.
And this judge, keep in mind, had been
listening to the Navy make factual assertions from the
very beginning. And the factual assertions that the
Navy made at the start of this case about the nature of
the environmental harms were completely disproven by the
EA and by the expert evidence that was brought to bear.
And there are a number of statements that General Garre
may that I think I should address.
One of them in answer to questions from
Justice Ginsburg had to do with the Level A takes on
beaked whales. The Navy tries to dismiss those by
saying we only graded the effects on beaked whales as
Level A because we did that as a matter of generous
policy.
They didn't do it for policy reasons. They
did it because that's what the science compels, because
beaked whales have stranded repeatedly around the world
correlated -- caused by in the views of scientists, and
the evidence is overwhelming, by sonar. And the reason
that happens especially to beaked whales is because they
dive for very long periods of time. And when they dive
for very long periods of time, and they are then
bombarded with sonar, which by the way in sound
intensity, in this courtroom if we had a jet engine and
you multiplied that noise by 2,000 times, correcting for
water, that's the sound's intensity that would be going
on in the water if you were a marine mammal near that
source. The beaked whales, the scientists believe,
adjust their diving patterns; since they dive down for
so long, if they come up too fast, they get the bends so
there is evidence of -- when they do the necropsies of
these beaked whales, they find hemorrhaging, the
embolisms in various parts of the bloodstream and many,
many deaths. So there is enormous scientific evidence
that there is a greater harm to beaked whales that is
caused by sonar and that is precisely why the Navy was
compelled in the EA to recognize that evidence.
Now, one thing that was said here which I
found --
JUSTICE ALITO: Where in the record -- this
was the question I asked General Garre. Where in the
record is there evidence of -- that beaked whales would
be killed?
MR. KENDALL: The evidence of the prediction
of the Level A takes, in the --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what does Level A take
-- maybe can you put this in lay terms. Let's start
with kill. Where is the evidence that beaked whales
would be killed?
MR. KENDALL: It is in the -- there is a
table on page 223 of volume 1 of the joint appendix.
And then there are the discussions of beaked whale
injuries that General Garre referred to, and what they
show is that beaked whales will experience the effects I
described. But there is also expert evidence in the
record in the form of a number of declarations by
scientists who have studied beaked whales for -- for
quite some time. The evidence you can find, and it's
referred to on page 4 of our brief. Joint appendix
0-602, 673-89, 738-41, 760, the supplemental excerpt
of record at 180; also joint appendix 601, 666-667,
4-76, 680, 685. And there are a few other references
on page 4 of our brief.
I also wanted to talk about the behavioral
changes, because it's --
JUSTICE BREYER: This is -- I want to give
you a chance to say what's so terrible about what
they're doing. I will express a little frustration.
Not your fault. But why couldn't you work this thing
out? I mean, they are willing to give you quite a lot
of conditions, and you say, well, we have got to have
more conditions. And you are asking us who know nothing
about whales and less about the military to start
reading all these documents to try to figure out who's
right in the case where the other side says the other
side is totally unreasonable. And the issue at law
seems to be something that is going to last for two
months.
So -- so, why? What is so -- what is the
important thing here?
MR. KENDALL: The important thing here is
that the Navy is focused on having it its way or no way.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's very
unfair. There were six conditions imposed by the
district court. The Navy didn't even appeal four of
them. They gave up on four out of the six issues.
That's not insisting on having it their way.
MR. KENDALL: No -- I agree, although the
reason I believe that they conceded those is that the
record was -- was so overwhelming on each of those
points, they hadn't even put in evidence to suggest that
those measures would cause them any problem. They
simply didn't have the declaration, and even the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The other ways it
struck me how the district court relied on the fact that
the Navy had taken actions to protect marine mammals in
the past to say well, there can't be any problem with
adding more protection. No good deed goes unpunished.
MR. KENDALL: Well, if I can -- if I can
answer that this way. We negotiated with the Navy for
months and months and months, the Brinpack case, I
settled with them. We tried very hard to resolve this
case, but keep in mind that the Navy until the district
court ruled refused to agree to any measures that we
proposed -- any measures. So it was a binary --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They had already
taken actions unilaterally to protect marine mammals.
Now you say that wasn't.
MR. KENDALL: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they were taking
some actions.
MR. KENDALL: That's right. And -- and so
we had a litigation that was focused on were there
additional actions that should be taken; and there is
extensive evidence taken and extensive argument and then
the district court ruled. And the correct path, if the
Navy was aggrieved by that decision, was a higher court.
But instead, in order to avoid the clearly erroneous
standard -- and remember, that the clearly erroneous
standard as this Court said in the Anderson v. Bessemer
City case, says when there are two permissible views of
the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them
cannot be clearly erroneous.
So in order to evade that, and this is
typical of the tactics that we experienced and the
uncompromising nature of their approach that we
experienced, they went to CEQ to try to trump the entire
injunctive process. Now that they did without any
authority in NEPA --
JUSTICE BREYER: How does the basic thing
work? Because to a layperson, when I think of the armed
forces preparing an environmental impact statement, I
think, the whole point of the armed forces is to hurt
the environment. I mean --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't under -- I don't
understand how it's supposed to work. Of course they
are going to do something that is harmful.
MR. KENDALL: You know, the whole point of
the armed forces, I think is to --
JUSTICE BREYER: You see the point, I am
trying to give you a -- overstating it.
MR. KENDALL: I think the point of the armed
forces is to safeguard our freedoms causing the least
damage possible to our environment. And this Court has
recognized that repeatedly.
JUSTICE BREYER: You go on a bombing
mission, do they have to prepare an environmental impact
statement first?
MR. KENDALL: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: No.
MR. KENDALL: They don't.
JUSTICE BREYER: How does it work?
MR. KENDALL: We have never, ever contended
that any of our proposed restrictions should apply to
combat at all, and it doesn't.
This training was planned for a very long
time. Had -- there were questions earlier,
Justice Scalia I think raised a question is the EA as
good as the EIS? There is a big, big difference. There
are really two, between an EA and EIS. The substantive
difference is that an EA doesn't have the same
alternatives analysis that an EIS has, and the
procedural difference, which in a country that values
transparency and ideas and exchange with the public, is
the notice and comment that EIS requires.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I didn't assert that
they are -- that they are the same thing substantively.
My -- my only question is whether your assertion of bad
faith on -- on the part of the Navy holds water so long
as they were doing an EA. If -- you do an EA to see if
an EIS is necessary. And you say if there's no -- if
there is no significant harm to the environment, you
don't even need an EIS.
MR. KENDALL: That --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's how they
started. That's step one, and many agencies do that.
They are authorized to do that. I don't know why you
have to attribute bad faith to the Navy simply because
it began with an EA.
MR. KENDALL: That focus is not an element
of our case. I was simply responding to
Justice Breyer's question as, I admit, a somewhat
frustrated lawyer who tried to work things out as to why
it happened that they weren't worked out.
I do want to speak a bit about some of the
comments that General Garre made in response to
Justice Kennedy and Justice Scalia's questions about--
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- can I
derail you a little bit to get back to the balance of
equities question? As I read the opinions most of the
balancing here was done by the Ninth Circuit, not the
district court. I found the district court's balancing
in only one sentence. The court after all of its
prior -- the court is also satisfied that the balance of
hardships tips in favor -- favor of granting an
injunction. " It goes on. But it's just one sentence.
The Ninth Circuit talked about deferring to
the district court but in fact it supplied all the
balance of the analysis for the balance.
MR. KENDALL: Well, I -- with respect I
think the district court spoke in several different
opinions. So you can -- you can find out what the
district court was thinking by looking not only at the
injunction, but also at the -- at the responsible
district court denying the motion to vacate.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose it's still
fair to say that on all of those it focused most of its
attention on likelihood of success on the merits and
irreparable harm rather than a balancing of the
equities.
MR. KENDALL: Well I would disagree in one
respect, which is the court was very focused on which
measures to impose and which measures not to impose.
There were, you know, at least 10 pages of her
injunctive opinion going through that, and each -- and
the denial of the motion to vacate did the same thing,
because -- after the Ninth Circuit ordered Judge Cooper
to issue a tailored injunction, each side briefed very
extensively, with a huge amount of supporting evidence,
the issue of which measures should be imposed. And
Judge Cooper decided that certain measures would not be
imposed and certain ones would, and she explained why.
And she did that against the background of the harms
that were designed to be prevented. And so what I would
submit is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's -- I
think that's quite right.
My question, though, is that at no point
that did the district judge undertake a balancing of the
equities, putting on the one side the potential for harm
to marine mammals that she found -- and that's your
point about the record -- and putting on the other side
the potential that a North Korean diesel electric
submarine will get within range of Pearl Harbor
undetected. Now, I think that's a pretty clear balance.
And the district court never entered -- never went into
that analysis.
MR. KENDALL: There's a good reason why she
didn't balance that. And that gets back to my opening
remarks, which is that the premise of that question and
why, Mr. Chief Justice, you would be concerned about
that is that there would be an exposure to that
submarine, that North Korean submarine. But the judge
had made a factual finding, and the factual finding she
made was that training would not be affected. So, on
the one hand, you have a factual finding that there is
no harm to the training at all, which means that in the
balance the harms to the environment are much heavier.
JUSTICE ALITO: Do you -- how much
deference, if any, do you think the district court was
obligated to give to the Navy on that military issue
about whether the training would be effective? Is judge
Cooper an expert on antisubmarine warfare?
MR. KENDALL: No. Judge Cooper, like all
judges, has to sift through the evidence of experts, and
Judge Cooper gave great weight to the Navy on everything
that the Navy said. But there was a place where she had
to stop because, after all, she's a judge, and where she
had to stop was where the evidence belied the
declarations. And, you know, this Court has had in a
number of decisions to confront the question of whether
wartime exigencies forced the courts to suspend their
powers of judgment. I submit that what happened here is
that this court didn't, and that's what --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even the district --
even the district court recognized, in the words of her
opinion, that it would propose "a substantial challenge"
-- that's a quote -- for the Navy to shift the regime
that she imposed in the injunction.
MR. KENDALL: That's right, and it will in
fact pose a challenge and the proof is then in the
pudding, which is that the Navy has now conducted 13 out
of 14 exercises, the last 8 of which had been conducted
under this regime as modified by the circuit. And they
have not, as they were invited, had to come back and ask
for relief despite the fact that they had the
opportunity.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: By the time this case got
back to the court -- the district court a second time,
the President had made a determination that this was in
the paramount interest of the United States. The
Defense and Commerce Department jointly had made a
determination that this is necessary for the national
defense. And it seems to me, even if those
determinations don't resolve the EIS statement, they
certainly must be given great weight by the district
court in determining whether to continue the injunction.
If you could comment on that, incorporate it also in
what you were going to say about Mr. Garre's argument
with reference to the standard.
MR. KENDALL: Yes. First, responding to
that very point, it's common ground among the litigants
and certainly with the court that the interests ascribed
by the President and by every other government official
with respect to Naval training are of the highest
importance. The question was -- and this is the court's
factual finding, and the question is whether there was
sufficient record evidence to support it, whether she
was right that there wouldn't be an adverse effect
except for possibly some logistical changes, but no
adverse effect in terms of an achievement of the
training. If there's no adverse effect, then what the
President is speaking to is speaking past what's
concerning the court.
Now, with respect to irreparable harm, the
argument that General Garre made I think mistakenly
collapses the normal equity issue in this following
sense: Once a plaintiff satisfies Article III, very
important, and under the Japan Whaling case, the Lujan
v. National Wildlife case, there is no question that
these plaintiffs deserve to be in court, and it has
never been contested.
Then you move to the traditional equity
standard for assessing irreparable harm, Hecht v.
Bowles, but in the environmental area we have a
decision, the Amoco v. Gambell decision.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That
irreparable harm is the assessment of -- for purposes of
the injunction -- refers to the same harm that is the
harm which is the basis for standing, is it not?
MR. KENDALL: It always does, and the
question is somewhat different. And I think,
Justice Scalia, if you look at your opinion in the
second Lujan case and you think about the imminence
requirement of standing there, what irreparable harm
adds to that is the traditional need to show that the
harm you suffer cannot be quantified in damages or it's
difficult to quantify, and that a remedy at law will not
achieve the adjustment between the parties that's
required. That's what equity does. Equity preserves
the positions of the parties.
And as this Court said in Amoco,
environmental injury, by it's very nature, can seldom be
adequately remedied by money damages and is often
permanent or at least of long-lasting duration, i.e.,
irreparable; that is Amoco at page 545. If such injury
is sufficiently likely, therefore, the Court said, the
balance of harms will usually favor the issuance of an
injunction.
Now, there's one other point which was
briefly touched on here. Justice Kennedy was asking
what the circuits have said. Now, the circuits have
said different things about irreparable harm. The
leading edge of discussion in the circuits began with
then-Judge Breyer on the First Circuit in the
Massachusetts v. Watt and Sierra Club v. Marsh cases,
where he pointed out that NEPA itself has, while it's a
procedural statute, a substantive purpose, the
substantive purpose being informed decisionmaking. And
if there is not informed decisionmaking before there is
an agency committed to action, a harm has occurred.
That's the harm that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's unfortunately
contrary to what our opinions have said, which was quite
clearly that procedural --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- procedural injury is not
the kind of injury that gives rise to Article III
standing.
MR. KENDALL: Can I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The whole country can
complain about the failure to issue an EIS. That is not
the kind of injury that gives standing.
MR. KENDALL: I was only responding to
Justice Kennedy's question as to what the circuits have
said. That's the leading edge of what the circuits have
said.
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see why you backed
down on this.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kendall, you
wanted to respond to some comments by the Solicitor
General. I wanted to make sure that you've had an
opportunity to do that. I -- you were derailed by
--
questioning, but I know you responded to some. Are you
MR. KENDALL: That's very kind. I think
there's just one other point perhaps I should make,
which is there was some discussion of whether NEPA
actually authorizes CEQ to conduct this kind of
examination of a district court's ruling. I submit that
there is nothing anywhere in NEPA and certainly not in
the "fullest extent possible" language which gives that
authority. This Court has already decided that point in
the Flint Ridge case, where it said that NEPA does not
give way unless there is an irreconcilable conflict
between NEPA and another statute. They have pointed to
no such thing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Garre, have you one minute remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE
ON THE BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL GARRE: Thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice.
First, the Court of Appeals did not
adequately consider the balance of equities. It
completely disregarded the President's determination of
the paramount interests in these exercises. It
disregarded the Chief Naval Officer's evidence on the
harm of the 2200-yard shutdown, at Pet. App. 344-345A.
It disregard the harm as to surface ducting, Pet. App.
A.
Justice Alito, there is -- the EA says,
quote, on page 200 of the JA, "No serious injury or
mortality of any marine mammal species is reasonably
foreseeable because of these exercises." Page 170 makes
clear that that applies to beaked whales as well.
And finally I think I heard my colleague, my
friend, concede that you have to show Article III injury
in order to show irreparable injury. They not only have
to show irreparable injury to marine mammals, which they
haven't; they have to show irreparable injury to
themselves, and particularly as to beaked whales, which
none of the declarants and none of their members have
ever asserted they have seen. They can't possibly
establish any irreparable injury from any conceivable
harm to beaked whales, even though the record in this
case makes clear that all harms to the marine mammals
that we have been discussing today are temporary
non-injurious harms.
We would ask this Court to set aside the
decision of the Ninth Circuit, which seriously
interferes with critical training exercises that the
President, his chief Naval officers have determined to
be in the paramount interests of the United States.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I -- before you sit
down. I thought I recalled something in your briefing
dealing with the beaching -- your friend made a point
regarding the beaching of beaked whales, that very
substantially showed that they were caused by sonar.
