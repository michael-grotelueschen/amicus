CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Beach.
Mr. Fisher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
To be a vessel, a structure must be
practically capable of maritime transportation, and this
case turns on how to assess such practical capability.
And that's a question this Court answered
over a century ago in Cope and Perry, explaining that
practical capability depends not on any physical
attribute the structure might have, but rather, on "its
purpose," that is, whether its function is to move
people or things across water.
And that test has been applied numerous
times before and since, across decades, providing
stability and overall coherence to general maritime law.
And of course --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You should have phrased the
test that way then, because it really --
MR. FISHER: Pardon me?
JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't seem to me a
very felicitous description of what -- of what the test
is -- is enunciated to be.
MR. FISHER: Well, I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The test is whether it's,
what, practically able?
MR. FISHER: Practically capable.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Practically capable. Well,
you could be practically capable of doing something,
even though the purpose of -- of setting the thing up
has nothing to do with that.
MR. FISHER: Well, that's not what this
Court -- case is saying --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. I'm just
saying we ought to get a different test, and let's --
let's get rid of this. If we agree with you, let's get
rid of this practically capable test, because
practically capable, frankly, would make us come out the
other way in this case.
MR. FISHER: With all due respect, I don't
think that's correct. In Evansville in 1926, this Court
used that exact phrase, practical capability. And it
assessed that practical capability by looking at "the
function of the structure."
Again and again, in Evansville and other
cases, this Court asked, was the function of the
structure to carry people or things across water.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that just
has -- I understand that argument. It's got no
connection whatever to the statutory language, right?
MR. FISHER: Well, I think the word capable
obviously is in the statute. And what this Court said
as recently as Stewart is that capable --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Capable is in the
statute, purpose is not, right?
MR. FISHER: Correct.
And what this Court said in Stewart is that
capable means practically capable, not theoretically
capable. There's a range of how broad the word capable
can be.
And again, going back over a century, every
single time this Court's been confronted with that
question, it's used the term function to describe
whether or not something is practically capable of
carrying people or things over water.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you described
cases with this purpose -- or function, the briefs cited
the district court decision, Sea Village Marina, that
says floating homes like the one here that can be towed
and are not in the business of carrying people or goods,
but can be towed miles across the water, that those
constitute vessels.
And this district court decision,
Sea Village Marina, cited many, many cases. And you say
that that district judge got it wrong, or the cases were
wrong?
MR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, I think
there's a confusion of terminology that I hope I can --
that I hope I can straighten out at the outset.
The term floating home is generally
described to mean a residence that is designed to sit
still and is not designed to carry people or things over
water.
The term houseboat is something that is
self-propelled, generally moves people or things over
water.
What happened in the Sea Village Marina
case, to my understanding, is the Court simply used the
wrong term. It cited a lot of cases that held that
houseboats, as we describe a houseboat as something that
is designed to move its owner and the owner's things
from here to there, are vessels. And we don't dispute
that.
But on the other hand, you have something
called floating homes, which the brief filed by the
Seattle and Sausalito floating homes associations give a
very thorough description of what a floating home is and
how it's different.
And a primary way that it's different is
that, as opposed to a houseboat, which is doing its
function, it's doing its job when it's moving things
from place to place, a floating home can't function when
it's out in the water being towed. None of the
utilities work, none of the power, no equipment is
aboard to do anything --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but in -- in your
brief, I really lost count, but I think it's six times
on the first two pages, you talk about indefinitely
moored.
Now, the facts are in dispute, and we're not
quite clear of the facts, but let's assume that this
magnificent structure is -- which was mercifully
destroyed -- let's assume that it was attached to the
dock by a rope, a garden hose and an extension cord, and
that it could leave within 30 minutes notice. Is that
indefinitely moored? And if the answer is yes, is that
because of subjective intent of the owner?
MR. FISHER: Justice Kennedy, it would be
indefinitely moored. That's the term this Court used in
Stewart to describe whether something was being used to
transport people or goods.
It had said -- I have to emphasize that some
of the assumptions we do in fact dispute in your
hypothetical. But the fact that it sat still for three
years performing its function as a stationary residence
shows that it was indefinitely moored.
The importance of indefinite mooring,
though, I want to emphasize, is actually less important
in this case than it might be if this were a dead ship
case, where you had something that was concededly a
vessel --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose --
MR. FISHER: -- in the question --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you know the law school
game, suppose it was moved every month.
MR. FISHER: It would still not be a vessel.
And you don't have to look any further than this Court's
Evansville case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That would be indefinitely
moored, in your view?
MR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure if you'd use
the term indefinitely moored at that point, but it
certainly wouldn't be transformed into a vessel because
look at this Court's Evansville case. The structure --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you get to
Evansville, let's say it moved around, which is one
thing, but also it had a raked bow; it wasn't square.
Then -- then it starts to look more like a boat. It
moves around more frequently.
Its mooring -- I mean, if you have a
sailboat and you pull it up to a dock, you hook up for
water and plug in for power. It doesn't seem to me to
be terribly significant.
MR. FISHER: I think that's right if you
start with something that is a vessel; the fact that you
simply leave it at the dock for a long time doesn't take
away vessel status. That's what this Court held in
Stewart.
But if you start with something that isn't a
vessel -- and I give you the Roper case, which did have
a raked bow; it was an old Liberty ship that everybody
agreed had been decommissioned and turned into a
non-vessel. Then, they brought it in, they towed
it -- Justice Ginsburg, they towed it -- they loaded it
up with grain. Towed it again, let it sit still for a
couple years, towed it back, unloaded the grain. And
this Court said, it's not a vessel.
And why did this Court say it's not a
vessel? And I will quote from the opinion. It said:
"Because unlike a barge, the Harry Lane was not moved in
order to transport commodities from one place to
another; it served as a mobile warehouse performing its
function of storing grain." In the Evansville's case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, can I -- can
I -- I have been lost even as I have read the briefs,
because there's a lot of terminology that I'm not sure
-- and standards that have been proposed that -- what
concepts they're tied to, okay?
As I see our cases, I'm -- I'm not quite
sure where indefinitely moored came from. I've seen the
word permanently moored.
You seem to be suggesting a difference
between the two things, and I'm not sure where you get
the latter, indefinitely moored, from, and how that ties
to the concept of purpose.
Does it -- does the permanent status or
indefinite mooring of a vessel not make it -- of a
structure not make it a vessel, and/or does purpose get
layered on top of mooring?
MR. FISHER: No. Purpose is the overall
question. The way where --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it applies to
whether something is permanently moored or floating on
the sea?
MR. FISHER: That helps you determine its
purpose. So the word -- where the word indefinite comes
from, Justice Sotomayor, is from the Stewart case, where
this Court cited the Fifth Circuit's Pavone case with
approval, which had held that an indefinitely moored
floating casino was not a vessel.
JUSTICE ALITO: I just don't see how you can
get purpose into this statutory language. It says
nothing about purpose. It says, capable of being used
as a means of transportation on water. How does purpose
get in there? Whose purpose are we talking about?
MR. FISHER: We're talking about an
objective purpose, Justice Alito --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, then you're not
talking about purpose; you're talking about function,
right? You're just using purpose as a kind of strange
synonym for function.
But you're not talking about purpose of
either the homeowner or the manufacturer of the boat.
You're just saying what does this -- or what does this
thing, this floating home, do.
MR. FISHER: Exactly. And I'm doing -- if I
can just say this directly, I'm trying to do exactly
what this Court did in Cope and Evansville and Roper.
The exact analysis this Court applied in those cases is
precisely what we want this Court to apply here. But I
think what we're --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask about that
definition? That definition comes from the Rules of
Construction Act, right --
MR. FISHER: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which provides the
meaning of all -- of the word vessel as used in the
United States Code. Okay?
MR. FISHER: Correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what meaning of
vessel in the United States Code is at issue here?
MR. FISHER: The word vessel in the Maritime
Lien Act, which is what provides the Federal forum,
assertedly, for the plaintiff, the City, to bring this
case. So the word vessel is -- is its jurisdictional
and substantive hook.
Justice Sotomayor, if I can return to your
question about indefinite mooring, the importance of
indefinite mooring in this case, where you have
something that was not a vessel to begin with, is simply
to ask whether it's been transformed into a vessel,
exactly as this Court asked in Roper. So is it being
used for its function for which it was created and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Aren't you just
begging the question? You keep saying it was not a
vessel to begin with. Why -- doesn't it just restate
the question?
MR. FISHER: I'm not trying to beg the
question; I'm just trying to describe our argument to
you. There are some cases where --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't your
argument beg the question?
MR. FISHER: I hope not. I'm trying to
distinguish between two lines of cases, one being where
you have things that were -- like the Roper case, that
were made as boats, as vessels undisputedly, and now the
question is whether they've been pulled out of
navigation; as opposed to another set of cases, which we
believe this falls into, where the question itself is
whether this was ever a vessel. In those kinds of
cases, the indefinite mooring shows that it's being used
for its function.
It hasn't -- for example, if I could give a
hypothetical, maybe it would help, imagine a piece of
floating dock. Now, under their test, that would be a
vessel because you can unhook the dock, load it up with
stuff and tow it around, if a company wanted to use that
as a makeshift barge.
But no maritime case has ever held that a
floating dock is a vessel. But if somebody did that,
then it would no longer be indefinitely moored and would
be using a different function and might be transformed
into a --
JUSTICE ALITO: I think you may -- you may
very well have a good argument, but if you're relying
either on purpose or on indefinite mooring, then you've
lost me. I don't see how they get -- how you get those
into the words of the statute.
Suppose you have a boat, and it's tied up at
the harbor here in Washington. It hasn't been moved for
five years. It's indefinitely moved -- or 10 years or
20 years. But if it's capable, if you could untie it
and sail it out into the river, doesn't it fall within
the definition?
MR. FISHER: It absolutely does because the
function of a boat is to move people or things over
water. So when it's sitting still, Justice Alito, it's
not performing its function.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. So you are really
talking about a function test. And you are using
strange words, because they come out of our opinions --
kind of not your fault. But you're really saying that
what should apply here is a function test.
We are looking at this floating home. What
does it do? Is it just a thing that sits, or is it a
thing that transports things over water.
Isn't that your test?
MR. FISHER: Yes, it is. In addition --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it changes -- one
-- the same thing is not a boat sometimes, and it is a
boat. You've got a casino that's tied up for a month.
During that time, it's not a boat. And then they move
it around to go to the other side of the river, and
during that time it is a boat?
MR. FISHER: No, this Court in Stewart
rejected the snapshot test that I think is what you just
described.
The question is whether what -- whether it
has the function of moving people and things over water
or not. Now, some casinos go up and down the river --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but I'm just
-- the hypothetical -- the hypothetical I've posed was
meant to pose the question, well, sometimes things do
both, and how do we tell which it is --
MR. FISHER: If it actually does the latter
and is performing its function while moving, then it is
a vessel. And that's what this Court held in Stewart.
There's not a primary purpose test.
If one of its purposes is to move people or
things over water, then it's a vessel. But that's not
the purpose of a floating home. That's not the purpose
of a floating restaurant or something else that might
be float --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how do we know that.
MR. FISHER: But you could tie it up and
move it.
JUSTICE KAGAN: How do we know that, Mr.
Fisher? I mean, maybe these floating homes are just a
poor man's houseboat, right? That the point of getting
a floating home is actually to have a home that you can
hook up to a boat and move from place to place, and so
you don't have to, you know, have the motor running all
the time or have the capacity to move it all the time,
but when you want to move it on water and when you want
to move your possessions on water, you have the capacity
to do so.
MR. FISHER: Well, with all due respect,
Justice Kagan, that's not why people have floating
homes. The amicus brief explains that. Don't look
at -- but you don't have to look any further than the
history of this. The only two times it moved any
significant distance were: One, when it changed
ownership; and two, when a hurricane struck, so it had
to be moved.
And look at your own cases. In Pavone,
which this Court cited with approval in Stewart, that
structure moved hundreds of miles over several years.
This Court said not a vessel. The structure in
Evansville moved three different ways. It moved up and
down the Mississippi-Ohio River as it changed ownership
several times over the course of 14 years. It also
moved every winter to avoid the ice that would come in.
And thirdly it was repositioned on literally almost a
daily basis to accord with the stages of the river. And
again, applying this Court's well settled function test,
this Court said that's not a vessel.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it was still -- it was
still tied to the land with roads and ramps and so
forth. Here you've got the hose and the extension cord
and the rope.
MR. FISHER: Well, the important --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems -- and it
seems to me, suppose you -- you want us to make some
universal definition of we know what a floating home is.
Suppose this -- suppose there were -- another owner of a
structure like this, and it moved to a different slip
every week to get more shade or more wind or something.
Then that would be different?
MR. FISHER: It would sound to me just like
the floating warehouse and office in Evansville as I
just described that case. But Justice Kennedy, let me
say one more thing before I reserve my time.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose it moved --
suppose it moved up and down the canal to get better or
worse weather during different seasons.
MR. FISHER: If it's simply being
repositioned and not being used for a transportation
purpose, that is to move people or things, then it's not
a vessel. And that's exactly what this Court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I have the same
problem Justice Kagan says. The whole point is that it
can move. That's the whole -- that's the reason you
have it.
MR. FISHER: That is not the point,
Justice Kennedy, with all due respect. There's a
difference between a floating home and a houseboat, and
I urge you to look at the briefs on this point.
And this comes right back to your
question --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, outside of your
floating home, what other structures would be kept out
of your definition of purpose or function and the city's
definition of practically capable? Can you imagine any
other function that's out there floating around?
MR. FISHER: Other floating commercial --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because they disavow
water skis and garage doors and say they're practical,
capable tests with --
MR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure they can
actually disavow that on their tests, but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I know. But --
MR. FISHER: Floating commercial
establishments, floating pieces, floating docks,
floating trampolines and play structures.
And, Justice Kennedy, if I could just answer
your question and reserve the rest of my time. The
importance of the connecting of the utilities and the
water hose, which was actually a specialized water hose,
not a garden hose, but the importance of those
connections is found in State codes across the country
that distinguish between floating homes and houseboats,
asking whether they're dependent on those connections to
operate.
A floating home cannot function if it's not
tied to land. It doesn't matter how many amps we want
to fight about, it's whether it needs that power from
land, whether it needs those connections to land. A
houseboat, like any other vessel, can fully function
away from port.
If I can reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Gannon.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON,
FOR UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court:
I think if I could start with Justice
Kagan's questions, the government's position is that
this is an objective function test and in evaluating
when a structure is practically capable of being used as
a means of transportation this Court has repeatedly
recognized that function is important to that inquiry.
It did so as recently as Stewart, when it
recognized that the function of the dredge there was to
carry crew and equipment across Boston Harbor in the
course of dredging a trench.
It also did so in the cases that
Petitioner's counsel has already talked about,
Evansville, Roper --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- can I
interrupt you just there on the dredging? You say the
function of the dredge was to carry people and
equipment. I would have said the function of the -- the
dredge is to dredge in the middle of the river.
MR. GANNON: Well, the Court --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right? And so --
and I don't know which of us would be right, so it seems
to me that that function test is a very difficult one to
apply.
MR. GANNON: Well, the Court in Stewart said
that "dredges" -- and I'm quoting from page 492 --
"serve a waterborne transportation function, because
they carry crew and equipment across" --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know what it
said. I guess I would say, obviously, it serves a
waterborne function, but I'm not sure the first thing I
would say when I see one of these dredges in the middle
of the river is its purpose is to move people and
equipment. I would say its purpose is to dredge.
MR. GANNON: Well, but in general, it needs
to dredge not just in one place, because it's not just
dredging a hole, it's dredging a trench. It usually
needs to move in order to do that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know but
that's saying that it has to be able to move, and I
agree with that. But its purpose is still to dredge,
not to move.
MR. GANNON: Well, I think that the Court --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could use it if
you had a -- you know, a transportation boat, right?
Any equipment you need to move, you put it on another
boat and drop it off. The people who work, you bring
them over and drop it off.
MR. GANNON: Yeah, I think that you could do
that. I think that's typically not the way the dredges
that -- not the way the superscoop works in Stewart and
it's not the way historic dredges worked in the case
of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure it is, isn't
it? I mean, the superscoop doesn't go to the -- maybe
it does -- go to the shore every morning, then come
right out again? They move people back and forth with
other boats, don't they?
MR. GANNON: Oh, but I -- what I meant is
that there are people and equipment on the superscoop
when it is moving across Boston Harbor. They didn't
sort of take it out there all empty every morning and
then load other things on to it that they -- that they
brought out there.
And in Evansville, the Court recognized that
the wharf boat there, which is a large structure -- it
was 240 feet long, 48 feet wide -- it served as an
office, a warehouse, and a wharf on the side of the
river, and the Court said that it performed no function
that might not have been performed as well by structures
permanently attached to the --
JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose someone builds a
replica of an historic watercraft, a Viking boat, the
kind of outrigger canoes that the Polynesians used
throughout the Pacific Ocean, and the purpose of this is
to display it in a museum, no one has any intention
whatsoever of ever putting it in the water, but it's
built so that if they did, it would -- it would function
just like its historic antecedent, is that a vessel?
MR. GANNON: I think that that would be a
vessel, because it really -- its objective function, if
you look at its design and its natural function --
that's just the phrase that the -- even Respondent's law
professor amici used. They acknowledged that the
function and purpose test is appropriate if it takes
account of the craft's own design and natural function.
JUSTICE BREYER: What about the -- I thought
there was a -- a kind of caveat in one of these cases,
maybe Stewart, that said take a thing that looks just
like a boat, the Queen Mary, but if it is permanently --
they use the word "indefinite." I think they mean
"permanently."
MR. GANNON: Well, the Court --
JUSTICE BREYER: But if it is permanently
moored to the shore and is never going to sea again,
then it isn't a vessel.
MR. GANNON: That's true. That's because
it's no --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then if the Polynesian boat
is permanently in the museum, there's a lot of objective
evidence of that, it would not be a vessel. But if it's
something they really could well take out on the sea,
then it is, is that right?
MR. GANNON: It is true that the Court
recognized in Stewart and the Coast Guard's craft
routinely operated dockside policy is based upon the
presumption that something that used to be a vessel can
cease to be a vessel if it is semi-permanently or
indefinitely moored. That's the phrase that the Court
quoted in Stewart. And the Court recognized that even
something that's anchored to the seabed could --
JUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't come up here.
That concerns the Queen Mary being sent to Long Beach
and used as a hotel.
MR. GANNON: And the Queen Mary is behind
a -- is essentially behind a cofferdam. It doesn't have
ready access to open water. It's connected to shore in
all sorts of permanent ways. We don't think that that's
the type of case that we have here, because nobody is
saying that this once was a vessel and it is now no
longer one just because it's tied up to the dock in the
way that it was tied up here.
And so, Justice Kennedy, we think that this
isn't really a case about indefinite mooring as making
the difference. This is a case where you need to start
with the question of was it ever a vessel. And
if the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I was right. So that
permanent mooring is a different inquiry in your mind?
MR. GANNON: Well, permanent mooring is
usually going to be relevant to the question of whether
something ceases to be a vessel, as it's no longer
practically capable of being used as a means of
transportation. That's the way the Court discussed the
point in Stewart. And -- and that's true even for a
case like Roper, which was a former Liberty ship that
was towed up and down the James River.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's a -- that's
a somewhat easy case, because the hull, I think, was
removed or something was removed that made it --
MR. GANNON: Well, there were things that
had been removed when it had been decommissioned
originally. But if the court of appeals test were used
here and the court were to conclude that something is a
vessel, if it is merely capable of being towed across
water even to its detriment, then you can't explain the
answer in cases like Evansville or in Roper where --
because the Evansville wharf boat was towed at least ten
times, as described in pages 21 and 22 of the Court's
opinion, and nobody was asking whether it had all
the office furniture and light fixtures and things like
that removed when it was towed at least twice a year for
the seven years before that suit began.
JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Gannon, you think
that even at the moment that the thing is being
transported, and let's say that the thing has, you know,
various furniture and things on it, you think even at
that moment under section 3, it's not a -- it might not
be a vessel?
MR. GANNON: That's generally going to be
true, yes. If the purpose of the structure, the
function, the objective function of the structure is to
operate, just to be stationary beside the dock, then
it's not going to be a vessel even when it's being towed
behind another vessel. There may still be rules about
how it needs to be lit at night and things like that,
but --
JUSTICE ALITO: What if it was more
seaworthy so that it could be towed 200 miles without
suffering any damage, even if there are, you know, small
waves, let's say?
And the reason why it was built that way was
so that when the person moves the person wouldn't have
to hire a moving company to come with a van and take out
all the person's personal belongings and ship those
by -- by land. This -- this is capable of moving and
moving all the stuff that's in it without having
anything damaged. Would it be the same? What would be
the result there?
MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I understand the
point. I think that, under a case like Evansville, that
there does seem to be a difference between relocating
the structure and using the structure to transport
people and things.
But under an objective function test, if it
really is designed to be mobile, and we look at it and
we say it really looks like a boat and it's designed to
move through water efficiently, it would probably look
different from this particular craft.
But if ultimate mobility is part of the
function of it, then -- then the answer could well be
different.
But, for the most part, I think my answer is
the same as I was trying to give to Justice Kagan, which
is that this is either going to be a vessel all the time
until it becomes so permanently moored that it should no
longer be deemed a vessel.
JUSTICE ALITO: I really just don't
understand your answer. Mobility surely was a -- was a
purpose of this because it was moved.
MR. GANNON: Well, I --
JUSTICE ALITO: It can be moved.
MR. GANNON: There is a question about
practical capability of being used and --
JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Well, that's
something different.
MR. GANNON: And before, you were asking
about the hook in the statute here. We do think that
the word contrivance does indicate that it's something
that has a function that's determinable.
And there are lots of other areas in
maritime law where the function of a vessel is a
relevant question, and this is not an unanswerable
inquiry. The court uses purpose and function when it's
deciding whether somebody is a Jones Act seaman --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gannon, would you
have said sounds like this structure is not a vessel,
period. But your bottom line in your brief is that, if
we disagree with the Court of Appeals, we shouldn't say
this contrivance is not a vessel, we should send it back
-- for what?
What finding?
MR. GANNON: We think that the record here
was not really compiled with an object of answering
these questions, the things that we think are relevant,
because the district court and the Court of Appeals
flatly rejected any inquiry into the purpose or function
of the vessel. And --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what would we tell
them they should look into?
MR. GANNON: That they should look into the
purpose and function of the vessel. They should also
consider whether it would be damaged when it was towed.
That was something that petitioner tried to get. He was
proceeding pro se in the district court, offered to
present evidence about --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: On the first question,
purpose or function, what did they know that we can't
know by looking at this picture and listening to these
arguments?
MR. GANNON: Well, I think that they could
hear more about --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I would be willing
to stipulate they are better at this than we are, but
let's -- let's assume.
MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that
somebody -- if somebody -- I can't tell everything about
the structure. We have these pictures, and we know that
it has a ten-inch draft, but we don't really know how --
how well it is that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I want to be fair to the
Court of Appeals, well, now, you tell us what the
purpose and function is.
MR. GANNON: And I -- if --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't we know that?
MR. GANNON: Well, I think that you -- in --
this is going to be a somewhat idiosyncratic case. I
think that this is an unusual structure. That's why the
surveyor on page J-43 of the Joint Appendix found that
there were no comparables for sale in the state of
Florida. And so I think that most cases aren't really
going to -- to be like this.
But if I wanted to put on evidence about
that, I would probably compare -- decide whether this is
more like the floating homes that are described in the
Seattle floating homes brief, that are really designed
just to function in place near the shore. I think that
there would be more evidence about its capabilities
while it was actually out on the water and things like
that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FREDERICK: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The City brought this In Rem action against
Mr. Lozman's uninsured houseboat to enforce maritime
liens. The houseboat was in violation of the wet slip
agreement, and it posed a hazard to other vessels in the
marina if, because of its flimsy moorings, it came
unmoored during a storm.
The houseboat was located very close to the
navigable channel of the Atlantic Intercoastal Waterway
and next to a yacht-building facility next to the
marina. So the city faced a very real specter of being
sued if the uninsured houseboat came unmoored and caused
damage.
Our position is that the houseboat is a
vessel under section 3 because it floats, moves, and
carries people or things on water, as the statutory --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just like an inner
tube, right?
MR. FREDERICK: No. An inner tube actually
does not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Floats, can be
towed, can carry a person.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, a person actually --
most of the body parts of a person would be underwater
and would be through the water, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of those
inflatable rafts where most of the parts of the
people --
MR. FREDERICK: The test would be what's the
practical capability, and a raft that has a bottom
actually could very well be a vessel under the
appropriate standard of practical capability.
JUSTICE BREYER: This cup. What about the
cup?
MR. FREDERICK: Cup is not because a cup
doesn't float.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, this is lighter
than you think.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. How about a garage
door?
JUSTICE KAGAN: Take the inner tube and, you
know, paste a couple of pennies on the inner tube. Now
it carries things. There are things on the inner tube,
and it floats.
MR. FREDERICK: Justice Kagan, I -- I think
we could imagine all kinds of de minimis types of
hypotheticals that would satisfy the basic criteria.
But what the Court in Stewart said was practical
capability as viewed in a real world sense. And I'm not
aware of any case -- and they've certainly not pointed
to anything -- that identifies anything with those kind
of practical attributes that would be subject to
litigation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, practical
capability viewed in a real-world sense -- and you're
about transportation -- you're talking about things that
were built for transportation, right?
MR. FREDERICK: You're -- yes. You're --
that is true in the sense that one of the purposes, as
manifested through its physical characteristics, is the
ability to be moved across water.
And just as Mr. Lozman's houseboat here was
moved 200 miles in the first towage after the hurricane
wiped out every other vessel in the docks in the north
bay marina, and he had it towed with a speed boat
70 miles to the city of Riviera Beach, those physical
characteristics and attributes were recognized by the
Court of Appeals when it applied the practical
capability test.
And it said on page 15(a) of the petition
appendix that certainly living, a domicile, is a purpose
of a floating home, but mobility is also a purpose, and
then demonstrated that mobility here.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your definition,
how do you deal with Evansville?
MR. FREDERICK: Evansville is a case with
many layers, but let me just start first start with the
fact that the Court announced a practical capability
test in Evansville itself. That's what it applied. It
reviewed a district court record that had found no
practical capability on the basis of the driveways and
the more permanent connections to the utility system of
the city, and it reviewed that factual record for clear
error, which, of course, it didn't find, by --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you are basically
saying, we reached the wrong conclusion because the
wharf boat floated, and it regularly was moved, and
there was nothing to suggest that it couldn't carry
people or things. It happened not to because they would
empty it, I understand, before they moved it, but it
could have.
So if it was practically capable of
floating, whether it was semi-tied to land or not, it
was released from land on somewhat of a regular basis.
So are you suggesting that in Stewart we change the
Evansville rule?
MR. FREDERICK: No. In Stewart you said
what the holding of the case was, which was that it was
not practically capable of movement at the time that it
sank.
Now, I would like to just step back for a
second because I think Evansville needs to be understood
in the time in which it was decided. At that time, many
courts, including this one, at times, applied a snapshot
test, what is happening to this particular watercraft at
the moment in time where an admiralty tort occurs, where
the contract ensues, and the like.
This Court subsequently disavowed the
snapshot test; but, in Stewart, what the Court did was
to describe Evansville and Cope as cases about not
practically capable of movement or carriage because of
their connections to the land.
In Evansville, the owner of the wharf boat
also owned the adjoining land and had control over the
dock and built driveways so that trucks could come on
and off, and had an eight-inch concrete lining on the
houseboat which are not typically -- sorry, on the wharf
boat, which are not typically attributes one would think
of as ordinarily for vessels.
JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I got stopped here,
back at Stewart. "Practically capable of maritime
transport." Now, those are words I thought you have to
interpret with some degree of common sense, and the
reason for that is because each of us can of course
imagine all kinds of things, from Styrofoam sofas to --
to just dozens of absurd things that have nothing to do
with ships or vessels and really could be used
theoretically to carry something on the water.
So what we think of is that practical
capability means that there must -- this must really
have as a function, as one of its functions -- I'd like
to say purpose, but some people apparently don't like
that --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: -- because it - it has some
other implication that I don't understand. Okay.
So call it the function or the capacity, and
it really does as a significant matter of carrying
things, and not just accoutrements like nails in its
walls, but -- but things from place to place to some
significant degree, okay? So I've just taken the words
of the test and through voice -- and trying to focus
your mind, I've said you have to do that really as a --
it has to be some significant degree there, which this
one doesn't seem to have, all right?
So you see what I'm trying to do, and really
it's a way of getting you to respond to that.
MR. FREDERICK: I think it certainly did
have that. It had that capability, Justice Breyer,
because it was actually moved on multiple occasions.
JUSTICE BREYER: But it wasn't carrying
things.
MR. FREDERICK: It was carrying his personal
effects.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true. And of
course a Styrofoam sofa is -- is carrying the holes, or
it's carrying the -- you know, the -- the coffee can or
something that is on top. But when you have a thing
that carries itself, that isn't good enough.
MR. FREDERICK: I --
JUSTICE BREYER: It has to be something to
do with transporting a thing, transporting some stuff.
MR. FREDERICK: It transported his
computers; it transported his clothes. Except for the
fact that his guns were confiscated before the marshals
took it --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what part of the
house.
MR. FREDERICK: -- it was moved, that -- no,
they're not part of the house. They're part of the
personal effects, just as someone had personal effects
in his or her dwelling. And when the marshal towed it,
it carried two people as part of the crew for the
transit between --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Think of what
it's doing and compare that with the dredge that every
day the workmen get on, they go into the middle of
Boston Harbor, and then they start to work, and they
dredge.
And so you'd say, well, I see one of the purposes of
this boat is to carry those people out there.
Now think of this one. This one is carrying
things, but that which it carries is just what is part
of a normal house which has nothing to do with
transporting things on water.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, actually, I think Mr.
Fisher conceded that if this had a motor and it was
carrying exactly the same personal effects, it would be
a vessel.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. How do you then
distinguish -- I see where you're -- you're just saying
my distinction is not going to work, and so then I'd ask
you to say what one you want to come up with that will
get rid of all the absurd examples that are lurking in
the back of my mind, which I will avoid -- and yet
include --
(Laughter.)
MR. FREDERICK: I think that a vessel that
has practical capability, a watercraft that has
practical capability to float, move and carry goods or
people, that's a vessel.
JUSTICE BREYER: The floating sofa? The
floating sofa? Somebody is retired, he likes to see it
float around in the water, and you know, and it carries
a cushion. I mean, really that's absurd. So -- so how
do you distinguish -- I gave you an absurd example. I
don't need to think of more.
MR. FREDERICK: I think I've given up the
absurd hypos because there are no litigation on them.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose, Mr.
Frederick, this. Suppose we had a trial on the question
of whether these floating homes or this floating home
was a vessel, and we found out that actually 99 percent
of people who buy floating homes move it exactly once.
They purchase the floating home and then they move it to
the place where they want the home to be, and then it
sits there. And this was just a clear evidence that,
you know, except if there's a hurricane or a tornado,
people do not move floating homes. They buy it, they
move it to where they want to live, and then it sits.
In that case, do you think the thing is a
vessel?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes, if it has the practical
capability. That's what the statute says, Justice
Kagan. It depends on if you want to rewrite the statute
to have subjective intent --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it's a statute --
MR. FREDERICK: -- of lots of vessel owners.
JUSTICE KAGAN: You're reading the statute
-- you're reading the statute as if it says something
can be transported over water. But the statute doesn't
say that. It says something can be used or capable of
being used as a means of transportation on water. So
that -- that the question is whether this thing is
transporting other things over water, and whether that's
its function; and in my hypothetical it's not its
function. Its function is to serve as a house. That
house happens to be on water, but it's just a house.
MR. FREDERICK: Justice Kagan, the fact that
a vessel only moves once doesn't mean that it's not a
vessel if it has -- if it meets the attributes of the
statute, as explained by this Court in Stewart, of
practical capability. The Titanic, of course, is a
perfect example of that.
The fact that a person may choose mobility
as a -- as one of the attributes and not exercise that
attribute of course goes to subjective intent, and as
the Maritime Law Association's brief points out here,
you do not want to apply an intent standard that goes to
what the owner intends to -- which function the owner
intends to exercise, because that leads to manipulation.
And the casino --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, the city's
position, it is whatever we want it to be. That is the
first time Lozman was sued by the city. It was not
under admiralty jurisdiction, it was a plain old
landlord/tenant suit in State court, right?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes, but there are some
exceptions and if -- I will let you finish your
question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, well, my question
is, is it -- is it a vessel when you want it to be, and
just an ordinary landlord/tenant situation when you want
it to be that way?
MR. FREDERICK: No. I would answer that
question as no.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take this
very incident, that is he failed to comply with the
revised rules and he was behind in his payment of
dockage fees. Could the city have brought that case in
an ordinary State court for the arrears?
MR. FREDERICK: No.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not?
MR. FREDERICK: Because it's a vessel and
the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of the United
States courts means that it has to be litigated in the
United States courts.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about --
MR. FREDERICK: That's why in the first one,
if I could just explain about the State court, because I
think that there is some misapprehension about what
happened.
His dog was not complying with the
ordinances, and he was not complying with the city
ordinances; that's why -- that's why the city brought
the in personam action against him in State court.
There was no admiralty basis there. He was still paying
all of his dockage services and fees. It became an in
rem action when the lien was not being discharged
through his payment on the dockage fees, and the city
had a basis under the wet slip agreement to assert a
maritime lien, which is a classic admiralty action under
Federal jurisdiction.
So they are very different actions. Under
the State court action he could still stay at the
marina, but he had to be on a houseboat that complied
with the marina's rules. He had two house boats at the
marina, and this one was not in compliance, and that is
why the city brought action against it. It was the only
one of the 500-plus vessels and boats in this marina
that wasn't in compliance with the rules.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: We -- we want I suppose to
give the courts of appeals a test that works. I -- see
if this is, sums up your argument, or your position.
You look to see the objective
characteristic, the physical capacity of the -- of the
structure, and then you look not to purpose but to its
objective function: Does it carry goods under the
statute. And then I suppose you could under that say
that this is a vessel, but that this presumption is
overcome if it's permanently moored in a way the
Evansville dredge was. Is -- is that your argument?
MR. FREDERICK: I think that sums up in a
nutshell what we would regard as a proper statement of
the law, of what this Court has already said, and that
is that if it's got practical capability, those
practical characteristics, Justice Kennedy, will
manifest itself in the functions. If somebody wants to
buy a domicile on land, one buys a house or a condo. If
you buy a floating home, that has the attribute, the
physical characteristics of floating, movage -- and
moving and carriage --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's where - that's
exactly -- I mean, I think that works pretty well; and
you think that works pretty well, but I don't agree with
you at the moment hypothetically. So something's wrong
somewhere. And what I'm thinking is that you could have
very odd things, you know, like an advertising sign,
floating advertising sign and tow it around. Is that
floating advertising sign a vessel? No, it doesn't
carry goods but it does carry, say, the eyes on the
figure which might move around; and then it does -- and
Justice Kennedy said carrying goods. All right. Does
this structure, this houseboat have a function of
carrying goods? You're tempted to say yes, because his
personal effects are in it. I'm attempted to say no,
because there is nothing special about those personal
effects that isn't exactly similar to their being in a
similar structure on land.
That's where I am wondering if there is a
distinction. That's -- do you see what I -- what's
bothering me?
MR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer, there is no
basis, I mean, with all due respect, there is no basis
in your cases to -- to hold that there is something
about transportation that makes it somehow uniquely
nautical or maritime as opposed to --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, it's nothing --
MR. FREDERICK: -- household effects or
other goods or services or people that are transported
over land. And that's why when the normal definition of
transportation is to convey a person or a thing from one
place to another, that's perfectly satisfied under the
facts of this case. And it is an undisputed record as
Petitioner says, on page 27 of the cert petition, they
ask for cert here for you to decide whether Mr. Lozman's
state of mind about his indefinite mooring is somehow
relevant to the definition of a vessel. It clearly
isn't.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess the problem is
the list of absurdities that they point to, not the
least of which is a dry dock, which you talk about
whether it's permanently moored or not, but most dry
docks are held in place by, you know, heavy ropes but
you can cut them and you can stick something on them and
they can float away. Under -- so how do you --
MR. FREDERICK: I don't accept the premise
of your argument. The --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For the --
MR. FREDERICK: The dry docks with which I
am familiar are anchored to the bottom so that they can
stay in one place and they don't carry anything, so they
don't meet the part of the test that requires carriage.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you do with
the --
MR. FREDERICK: They are simply physical
structures --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- trampoline and the
other examples your adversary gave? Is a trampoline
that floats on water capable of moving -- it's moving
the trampoline.
MR. FREDERICK: I don't think it's
practically capable of carrying anything.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's carrying the
Trampoline.
MR. FREDERICK: And again --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is the difference
whether I attach something permanently or temporarily to
the top of the floating thing, the floating board, the
floating whatever?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, it would not be
subject to towage. Here the houseboat had -- this is
important because the houseboat under the testimony Mr.
Lozman elicited at trial had four towing cleats that
were welded into the structure of his houseboat so that
it could be towed without torquing and twisting the
houseboat and causing it to sink. The hypotheticals
that the other side has suggested don't have that
additive feature of towing cleats that are used for the
purpose of being able to convey the houseboat --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your
example of the towing cleats highlights one of the
difficulties I have; one, because obviously the question
of, well, what if they didn't have the towing cleats,
and then what if they had the towing cleats and then
took them off, what if they were temporary towing
cleats. One of the things, this is a jurisdictional
statute and we like jurisdictional statutes to be clear
and easy of application. Why do you think your test is
easier than your friend's test?
MR. FREDERICK: Because the physical
characteristics of this houseboat all point to the
attributes of being a vessel. It floats, it moves, it
carries. It's got nothing to do --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's got -- it
doesn't have -- the thing that makes something look most
like a boat in my view is a raked bow. That tells you
that that's what they want to use it for, to move
through the water. This is straight up and down.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, Mr. Chief --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't have a --
what are the things called on the side, the elevated
sides that you'd look for in a boat.
MR. FREDERICK: We would submit that
Congress did not intend a you-know-it-when-you-see-it
test. House barges, barges have been vessels since the
time of Cleopatra. The fact that it is flat-bottomed
and it floats and it moves and it carries things does
not make it not a vessel.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, this is
kind of an idiosyncratic case. There are many cases I
think in the courts now about floating casinos. I take
it on your definition the floating casino would be a
vessel subject to maritime jurisdiction.
MR. FREDERICK: Yes, unless it has a
physical impediment that takes it out of one of the
three attributes that doesn't make it a vessel. If --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: As long as the vessel
stays in one place and the gambling goes on in one
place, then it may be towed to a different location, and
it stays there. You -- you say because it is able to be
moved from one place to another it qualifies as a
vessel?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even if it's rather
permanently moored with a, with a -- like the Intrepid
on the Hudson River --
MR. FREDERICK: I'm not familiar --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: With about -- aircraft
carrier. But it's really fixed in there with regular
walkways and so forth. Very -- it would cause a lot of
work in order to move it.
MR. FREDERICK: We suggest that the way the
court should think about that problem is as a physical
impediment. Are physical impediments preclude its moat
movement or carriage or floating capacity --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Frederick, if that is
the case, then your test really comes down to how
securely is something fastened. I mean, you have to
deal with Evansville's wharf boat and you have to deal
with Cage's dry dock, and you have to deal with all
these floating casinos and restaurants. And you're
saying that in all these cases we are supposed to look
to is it a rope or is it a cable, how many cables, how
quickly can it be disengaged, and that that's going to
end up being the test that you would have us adopt which
is how easy it is to get out of the port.
MR. FREDERICK: I think that's a fair way to
view it, Justice Kagan, and it's a perfectly appropriate
one. The Belle of Orleans case --
JUSTICE KAGAN: That really does become a
jury question -- a question of fact for everything,
right? You know, are there six cables, are there nine
cables, what are they made of, you know, how long is it
going to take to rip up the -- the I-beams, whatever?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that as a
practical matter, this arises in only a couple of
instances and those are the casino boats, many of which
were vessels and they traversed the rivers allowing
people to gamble because that's how state laws required
them to perform. And they have since stopped trying to
be vessels because of state law changes that they were
able to make. And so the question as a practical matter
is are there physical impediments to the ability of that
boat to -- to use the capability to move? The Star of
India, which was referenced in the Belle of Orleans
case, was not -- was a vessel, a sailing vessel from the
19th century. In 1926 they took it out of commission as
a sailing vessel and they towed it to San Diego, where
it sat for 50 years tied to the dock, and for the
bicentennial, they decided let's get the boat out and
sail it and they sailed it for the bicentennial. The
Ninth Circuit held that's a vessel because it has the
capability of being used as a vessel. And the fact that
something is moored for a long time, if it has the
physical attributes to be a vessel, it is a vessel. The
United States -- the USS Constitution, the famous USS
Constitution would be shocked to have heard Mr. Gannon's
statement about vessel because there are 200 Navy
service members who service the USS Constitution and
take it out periodically for sail.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any problem here,
which I think maybe the Coast Guard and the other people
who are responsible for vessels, say once we start
thinking that everything in the house is a vessel -- I
overstate -- we're going to have an impossible time
doing our job. I mean, you know, you are going to see
some kind of a log next to a beach somewhere and
somebody's going to start calling it a vessel. We've
got to limit this somehow to things that really are used
as vessels.
MR. FREDERICK: Yes --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that a problem, and if
so, how would you deal with it?
MR. FREDERICK: If it were a problem the
Coast Guard would have signed the Solicitor General's
brief in this case which they have done in other cases
in which transportation and vessel status have been
relevant like in Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, United
States v. Locke, in which the Coast Guard --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is not very
compelling in this case because they have regulations
that pretty much echo what the Solicitor General is
saying, so it's not as if they were going to take a
different position. The Solicitor General is basically
saying follow the Coast Guard regulations.
MR. FREDERICK: And the statute underlying
those regulations, Justice Sotomayor, is found at 46 USC
4302, and it provides the secretary very broad
discretion on what to include within the regulations and
what not to. After this court decided the Stewart case,
the secretary suspended many regulations for dockside
vessels until the Coast Guard could issue new
regulations. There is a hint, there is a suggestion
that there might be a problem, but there is not anything
that is really given in practical terms.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, I mean,
there is some easy things to visualize as a problem. If
this is a vessel, then the maid that comes on twice a
week is a seaman under the Jones Act, right?
MR. FREDERICK: No. And the reason why is
because as this court recognized in Stewart, the in
navigation requirement is something that has been used
for limiting the reach of Jones Act seamen in those
circumstances in which a vessel is taken out of
navigation. So I think that it would be appropriate in
a case like this where this is a classic instance of a
maritime lien, dockage --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, taken out
of navigation, but not every time it's docked, right?
MR. FREDERICK: No. But no -- and in fact,
I think the question of who is a Jones Act seaman is a
different test that this Court last discussed in the
Chandris case, in terms of its substantial connection to
the mission of the vessel. And that -- I think that the
Court could safely leave the Jones Act issues aside,
because they bring in an entirely different regime that
focuses on the worker's connection to the vessel as
opposed to the definition of vessel itself.
The definition of vessel itself here is, as
Justice Scalia pointed out, part of the Dictionary Act,
and it is something that does apply more broadly. But
as we briefed in this case, there are two provisions
that take that definition and then they add an intent
requirement as specific language in different parts. So
that if that idea, function, or intent or purpose is
something that is germane to that particular statutory
function, than that is a question that becomes a
question for jurisdiction.
But I'd also like to point out that both, I
think, the district court and the court of appeals here
assumed that there was jurisdiction here because there
had not been evidence that contested the basic
principles that the City brought when it profiled this
in rem action.
And because the case then moved into the
merits phase, the district judge here initially denied
the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction without
prejudice. And then as the evidence came in, revisited
the question to provide a fuller explanation, and at
that time made the ruling that Mr. Lozman had not put in
record evidence that affected the practical capability
of the test.
The only thing Mr. Lozman argued in the
court of appeals as a reason for error was that because
he intended to live there indefinitely, even though he
had no contractual or property right to do so, and he
had signed a wet slip agreement that provided the marina
complete discretion to move his houseboat within any of
the slips, or to order of the houseboat to leave on 3
days' notice, the question of whether or not there was
any record of evidence on practical capability got to
the Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit, in
applying a practical capability test, said the things
that Mr. Lozman had argued, he didn't offer record
evidence.
So, Justice Kennedy, to your point, I think
that with respect to the Court of Appeals and how it did
do its job here is an important facet of the case as it
comes.
They initially asked you in the cert
petition, grant cert because the Fifth Circuit and the
Seventh Circuit have applied an onerous intent test.
They've not defended that test. And it is abjectly
erroneous because you can't have vessel status be so
easily manipulated by an individual's intent. And now
by trying to morph it into some kind of function or
objective purpose standard, they've essentially done
exactly what the Eleventh Circuit said they had offered
no evidence in the district court to try to prove.
If there are no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Fisher, you have 3 minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER: Thank you.
I think Mr. Frederick's best argument that
I've heard, and some of this Court has echoed it, is
that this is a vessel because it was moved around and it
carried his personal effects. The difficulty is that
argument runs absolutely headlong into Evansville and
Roper; it cannot be squared with those cases. And I
would be willing to rest my entire case on simply this
Court reading and applying those cases.
In Evansville, this Court dealt with
something that carried around the effects of a business
office. In Roper, this Court dealt with something that
carried around grain and was far more seaworthy than the
structure in this case.
Both instances, the Court said they're not
vessels because the function was not to carry those
things around, it was merely -- they were merely
incidental relocations.
Now -- so for that reason, the Eleventh
Circuit simply cannot be right when it says that
function is irrelevant. And the City can't be right on
its test either. The only way the City has proposed to
deal with those cases is to look at how securely the
structure is fashioned.
And Justice Kagan, you're exactly right. If
you want a recipe for disaster on jurisdictional
questions, start asking whether it's chains or ropes.
And not only that, if you want something that's utterly
manipulable, just tell the yacht owner who has his yacht
down in the harbor that all he has to do is hook it up
to the dock with chains instead of ropes and now he's
out of maritime jurisdiction.
So this Court's cases for almost a century
have applied the exact test we're asking this Court to
apply. And even if you're not 100 percent persuaded
that that's what the statute is best read as doing, that
is what we have done for over 100 years, and that is how
maritime law has built up and guaranteed on those -- on
those understandings.
And it's not just the questions we've been
talking today -- it's employment law, tort law, all the
rest are built on this test. And we're asking this
Court simply to reaffirm what it's done in the past.
So I think that leaves the question of, when
you know the Eleventh Circuit applied the wrong test and
you know the City's test can't be right, do you vacate
or do you send -- or do you simply reverse? And we
think -- Justice Kennedy, we think that you can simply
reverse. You have everything in the record you need,
most notably in the surveyor's report.
And you can look at four things. Look at
the -- look at the materials used, the shape of the
structure, its equipment and the utilities. The
materials used were plywood and ordinary land-based
structures.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is -- what was
used in the Higgins boats in World War II.
MR. FISHER: I'm -- I'm not saying any of
these are determinative, Mr. Chief Justice, but it's a
totality that tells you what it is.
And the next thing is the shape. Exactly as
you referred. This is a rectangle that sits 10 inches
under the water, is not meant to be moved around. Look
at the -- look at its features. It has French doors on
three sides a few feet above the water line. That's not
what a vessel -- not how a vessel is designed.
And finally, its utilities. Again, at Joint
Appendix 40, for example, it says this thing has no
batteries. It is utterly dependent on being hooked up
to land. That's the only way it can function.
So if this Court does nothing else between
now and casting its vote and writing its opinion,
revisit this Court's prior cases and reassert the rule
that this Court has always applied.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
