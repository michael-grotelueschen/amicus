CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Inc.
Mr. Rhodes.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RHODES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The single issue presented in this case is
whether the bar to review under 1447(d) is applicable to
a district court's discretionary decision to decline the
exercise of supplemental jurisdiction. In this case,
after the district court dismissed Respondent's federal
RICO claim, the district court remanded the remaining
state law claims under 1367(c). That was not a remand
based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because
jurisdiction was specifically conferred upon the court
by 1367(a).
It's been the rule for some 30 years that
the bar of 1447(d) is limited to the specific grounds
set forth in 1447(c). And for reference the statutes
are on page 2 and 3 of Petitioner's blue brief.
Those two grounds are a remand that's based
upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and a remand
that is based upon any defect other than a lack of
subject matter jurisdiction if it's raised by a timely
motion for remand filed within 30 days of the notice of
removal. The only prong of 1447(c) that's applicable in
this case is whether this remand is one that's based
upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
Now, Congress clearly conferred jurisdiction
on the district courts in 1367(a), where the case
contains a Federal claim and related State law claims,
and a remand based upon a court's discretion to decline
to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is not a remand
that's based upon the court's lack of subject matter
jurisdiction.
Jurisdiction either exists or it does not.
A district court's power to hear a case and its power to
decline to exercise jurisdiction are part and parcel of
the same thing. Absent the power to hear a case, a
district court cannot decline to exercise that -- or
cannot exercise discretion to decline to exercise that
jurisdiction.
Now, in this Court's Osborn v. Haley case,
it made reference back to Carnegie-Mellon and also
United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, that even if only State
law claims are remaining in the case after the Federal
claim has been resolved, the district court has
discretion consistent with Article III to retain
jurisdiction over that cause of action.
Now, this is inconsistent with the Federal
Circuit's analysis in this case that a remand based upon
67(c) is a remand based upon a lack of subject matter
jurisdiction because in its view an independent basis
for that jurisdiction is lacking.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there something odd
about saying if it's really fundamental like the
presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction, that
is not reviewable? It's not disputed, right? That if
the district court says, I lack subject matter
jurisdiction over, let's say, the RICO claim, as wrong
as that might be, that would not be reviewable, right?
MR. RHODES: Justice Ginsburg, I agree with
that, because if the court does say that I am remanding
this because, either rightly or wrongly, I lack subject
matter jurisdiction, then that would fall squarely
within 1447(c) and (d).
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Though that could be a
very grave error and yet, on a matter of discretion,
that that would be reviewable. And I appreciate your
statutory argument, but it just seems odd to think that
Congress would want to be firm that if the remand is for
lack of subject matter jurisdiction, wrong or right, no
review, but it was a discretionary exercise, I could
keep this, but I choose not to, that that is reviewable.
That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to
say the judge could keep it or remand it, that that
action is reviewable, but the action of saying I don't
have jurisdiction, when indeed the court did have
jurisdiction, is just totally immune from review.
MR. RHODES: I agree with you, Justice
Ginsburg, that that seems rather confusing. I would
address my answer in this way: The review ban of
47(d) arose in the situations where apparently
Congress wanted to -- to inhibit the abuse by those
seeking only to delay the case by filing a motion for
remand.
For example, a case that is filed in State
court that clearly expresses no Federal question or
diversity issue, yet the defendant, in order to delay
the case, will then remove it to Federal court. In
those situations Congress wants to prevent those kinds
of frivolous removals to Federal court.
But here in, our particular case -- and
maybe -- let me back up a minute. Maybe we should look
at that in a different way, because even though you may
have a legitimate basis for removing the case to Federal
court and the district court disagrees with you, perhaps
the better policy is that those types of remands should
not be reviewable, even though sometimes a district
court is going to get them wrong.
But in this particular case, there was a
Federal RICO claim asserted against us in state court,
and as a defendant we were not removing that case on
some frivolous basis. We were removing it because we
were entitled to be in Federal court.
It was only after the district judge
dismissed the Federal RICO count -- and there was no
motion for remand on this case filed by Respondents --
the district court sua sponte decided that he was not
going to exercise his power to hear this case because he
thought there were legitimate State law claims and he
remanded on that basis. Now, that's a discretionary
remand and normally we would be arguing that where
discretion is exercised by a district court it should be
reviewable for an abuse of discretion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't it be --
here the district judge said: I got rid of the RICO
claim; all that's left are State law claims, and there's
no Federal interest in this case any more. They're all
State law claims, they belong to State court, good-bye.
I could keep it, I choose not to, because it isn't a
sound use of the resources of the Federal court.
Now, even if you're right that this is a
discretionary decision, so you can't say no jurisdiction
because the discretion implies that there is power,
isn't it 99 cases out of 100 that the court of appeals,
assuming reviewability, will say, we should defer to the
district judge about questions of this nature, the
district judge's decision that this isn't worth the time
of the Federal court?
MR. RHODES: I'm not sure about the number
of percentage of cases that -- that there is going to be
a decision by the appellate court to say we shouldn't
interfere in that, Justice Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't you -- as a
practical judgment, the Federal claim is gone, there is
pending jurisdiction or now supplemental jurisdiction
over the State claim, but the district court is told by
Congress: It's your call; it's a matter of discretion.
And the judge gives one of the reasons that's
enumerated, that reason being that the State claims are
overwhelming in this case, the RICO claim is dismissed,
thinking it was worthless, so it's a State case.
Why would a court of appeals overturn such a
judgment?
MR. RHODES: I think, Justice Ginsburg, I
can give you an answer to that because there is a recent
case that's in our brief, the Brookshire case from the
Fifth Circuit, where the district court exercised
jurisdiction over Federal and supplemental claims, and
did that for quite a while and ruled on a number of
dispositive motions; and then basically on the eve of
trial, after resolving the Federal claim, remanded it
back to the State court.
The Fifth Circuit, because it had the
ability to review that, under the statutory
construction, was able to review that on the basis of an
abuse of discretion and said that the district court had
definitely abused its discretion. After retaining
jurisdiction for that length of time and then returning
it to State court, that was a waste of judicial
resources.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was because we
would have to retread the same ground in the State court
that had already been covered in the Federal court, but
that's not the kind of case that was presented here. I
know the case has lingered for a long time, but there
was no processing of those State law claims. The judge
concentrated on RICO, threw it out, and said "the rest
of the claims I'm not interested in."
So it's not a case like the Fifth Circuit
where there was a large investment of Federal court
energy and time and sending it back would mean going
over once again what had already transpired in the
Federal court.
MR. RHODES: That is true. This case is
different because what the -- what the district court
had labeled as legitimate State law claims as to, for
example, inventorship, we argued are within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court, and that is
why we appealed to the Federal Circuit in order to have
that issue resolved.
Here, if we went back to State court we
would be in the position of having to argue that the
State court -- that the State court lacked jurisdiction
to hear that claim because it was something that was
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court.
It seems that in this particular situation it would be
better to have the Federal Circuit to pass upon the
exclusivity of the inventorship issue under the patent
laws rather than to have to go back to State court and
work back up through the State court system to have that
resolved.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you explain why
that is a Federal question? It's a dispute over the
ownership of this invention, right? So it's not a
question of the validity of a patent or infringement of
a patent?  It's just the invention is like any res, and
two parties are disputing about ownership. Why is --
why does that become a Federal case?
MR. RHODES: It became a Federal question
because in our view it arose under the patent laws
because when they filed their complaint, even though
they couched it in terms of purely State law claims,
they did allege that we had falsely claimed to be the
inventors; and the basis for that claim that we falsely
claimed to be the inventors was the oath and declaration
that was filed in connection with our patent
applications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
So what they were raising was an issue with
respect to our ability to claim to be the inventors of
what we claimed in our U.S. patent application.
Therefore, since that falls squarely under our
entitlement to -- to inventorship, of what we claim to
be the inventors, under Article I, section 8, it seemed
to us that that clearly fell within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Federal court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask one sort of
a preliminary question? If we just applied the plain
language of 1447(d), then this case was properly
remanded; the remand order is not subject to review. Is
that correct?
MR. RHODES: Yes. If we just read 1447(d)
on its face, that's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: What really prevents us
from reaching that decision in this case? Because
actually it's an open question because you were both
arguing about it here and you certainly disagree. Why
couldn't we just simply say for this particular category
of remand orders, we'll just apply the plain language of
47(d)?
MR. RHODES: That would be going against the
rule that was set out in Thermtron that 1447(d) was
limited to only the specified grounds of 1447(c), which
are lack of --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand it would be a
modification of the dicta in Thermtron, but why wouldn't
that be a simple solution to this case?
MR. RHODES: I'm not sure that would be a
simple solution to this case, Justice Stevens, and the
reason for that is that if we -- if the Court decides to
do that, then we return to those areas where total chaos
could really break out, and the reason for that is that
we would be in a situation where district courts can --
can dress up in language that is lack of subject matter
jurisdiction and remand cases, knowing that there is not
going to be any review.
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, no, that wouldn't
avoid the plain language of the statute. Pretextual
district court orders wouldn't avoid the plain language
of the statute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think there's no
need to dress up anything. I mean, as Justice Stevens
point, you wouldn't have to dress up anything; if you
send it back, it's not reviewable.
MR. RHODES: If we were to read 1447(d) just
plainly on its face without --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could we do that in
light of Thermtron? Thermtron went against the clear
text of the statute that says remands are not
reviewable, period; and in Thermtron the Court said, yes
they are sometimes, if we think it's so outrageous for a
district judge to say: Yeah, I've got jurisdiction over
this case, but my docket is so crowded, and this is a --
this is a small-change case; it belongs in State court.
The court, I think, was outraged by a district court
thinking that it could dump a case simply because it was
too busy with more important things.
That was the setting of Thermtron, and to
reach the result that the court reached, the court had
to go against the language of the statute when read in
absolute terms. But anyway, the court did that, and
then they gave a rationale for what the new test was
going to be. It was no longer going to be remands are
no longer -- remands are not reviewable; it's going to
be -- that applies only to the cases where -- what was
it, subsections (c) and (d) of 1447? The -- it -- the
court read the statute to say less than it in fact did.
That's what Thermtron did.
MR. RHODES: That is the exact holding of
Thermtron, that they were not going to construe that so
woodenly to allow a district court to abdicate its
mandatory jurisdiction.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, "woodenly" is
a bit much. I mean, they're going to read it not to say
what it says. And Thermtron involved the court saying:
I'm not going to take this because I'm too busy with
other things. I mean, it could be limited to that
unusual situation, couldn't it?
MR. RHODES: Mr. Chief Justice, it could,
but --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it would solve
the problem Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, that
this way you don't get to appeal big things like no
subject matter jurisdiction, but you do get to appeal
picayune things.
MR. RHODES: Again, I'm not sure how we
would divide those up between big things and picayune
things. But I think, to answer your question, we have
years of this particular rule under Thermtron being
uniformly applied by all the circuit courts of appeal,
and they have found this to be a workable, statutory
interpretation to give them a framework to handle these
kinds of cases. And it's not a situation where the
circuit courts of appeal have run away from situations
like this, where remands have been based upon declining
to exercise discretionary power to send it back to State
court. They have seemed to want to work within the
statutory framework to review those kinds of cases.
And I think it would be a large departure to
go back and try to modify what all the circuit courts of
appeal, except for maybe the Federal Circuit, had
adopted as a workable framework in order to solve these
kinds of problems.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, one clear way to do
it would be to overrule Thermtron, but neither party has
asked for that. You haven't asked for it and the other
side hasn't asked for it.
MR. RHODES: That's correct, Justice
Ginsburg.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You just have to
distinguish Thermtron. You don't have to overrule it.
You'd still apply it on its facts.
That's a very different problem. When the
judge says, I'm too busy to hear this, I'm going to send
it back to State court, that's what Thermtron resolved.
Here --
MR. RHODES: And yet --
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not involved here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your concern is what
was the Court's reasoning, and you could apply the
Court's reasoning, its interpretation of 1447.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to get rid of
Quackenbush, too, don't you?
MR. RHODES: Yes, Quackenbush is a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Throw that overboard, too?
MR. RHODES: We would have to overthrow that
as well, and the reason for that is because Quackenbush
was a remand based upon -- an abstention-based remand
under Burford, and in that case, this Court found that
abstention-based remands did not fall within either
prong of 1447(c). So -- in fact, this Court gave that
very little attention in Quackenbush before it moved on
to the 1291 issue.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You thought the
Respondents asked us to overrule Thermtron. On page 22,
you say, "Respondents' implicit request for this Court
to overrule Thermtron should be rejected."
MR. RHODES: Yes, we did say that, and I'm
not sure that they -- they expressly said you should
overrule Thermtron, but the strong suggestion in their
brief was perhaps you should.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't it -- isn't it
also the case that Congress has amended the relevant
provisions of 1447 since Thermtron and they have not
seen fit to overrule or change those provisions?
MR. RHODES: Given the fact that Congress
has twice amended 1447(c) after Thermtron, it seems that
they have actually ratified this Court's statutory
construction under Thermtron, and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this gets a lot
of attention across the street? The reviewability of
remand orders gets --
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, in one of
those provisions they said this was only technical
amendments, and if they're just doing technical
amendments that doesn't mean they have to look at it and
approve the whole thing.
MR. RHODES: No, Mr. Chief Justice, if they
wanted to get rid of Thermtron they could have done it
in a very direct way.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's right, but
what if we want to get rid of it?
(Laughter.)
MR. RHODES: I can't suggest what the Court
might finally decide other than to say that -- that,
again, the circuit courts of appeal have uniformly
applied this. They seem to be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they don't
have a choice, right? They can't say, I don't like the
Supreme Court rule so I'm not going to apply it, other
than the Federal Circuit.
(Laughter.)
MR. RHODES: Actually, Mr. Chief Justice,
that was going to be my next point. Not the Federal
Circuit -- but it does, again, provide a workable
framework for dealing with these issues, and it seems to
be a very large departure to go back and wipe out the
last 30 years of case law that has been developed to
handle these issues. It would be a large departure.
If there's no other questions, I'll reserve
the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just make one
comment on the large departure: Would it be a large
departure if we just said, in the very narrow category
of cases where there has been a remand on the basis of
-- the district judge doesn't want to exercise
supplementary jurisdiction over State law claims, that's
not appealable, period? Just say that's a slight
exception from Thermtron?
MR. RHODES: Well, Mr. Chief Justice --
sorry -- Justice Stevens, that would be an exception
under Thermtron that doesn't seem to be called for
because the way it's been interpreted, it has to be --
and the way even the amendments in '88 and again in '96
-- it's only barred if it's for a lack of subject matter
jurisdiction, and plainly here a discretionary remand --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- not for that basis?
They're not amendments of subsection (d), and subsection
(d) is what has the language that really reads right on
this case.
MR. RHODES: Well, I think the other -- the
other problem with that is the whole doctrine of -- of
supplemental jurisdiction that was first laid out in
Carnegie-Mellon and United Mine Workers, where the
difference between remands under 1367(c) seem not to
overlap with the remands under 1447(d) and 1441. So if
we made that an exception and we pulled this into
47(d), it -- I'm not sure what the consequences would
be from doing that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Allison.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE S. ALLISON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ALLISON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Let me begin with Petitioner's counsel's
last remark, and that is that we don't know what the
consequences would be, except that we do know that by
applying the review bar to supplemental jurisdiction
remands, it would bring us closer to achieving the
purpose that has been expressed in the statutes of
Congress since 1887.
I know that the Court is familiar with the
late Chief Justice Rehnquist's dissenting opinion when
he was an Associate Justice in the Thermtron case and
Justice Rehnquist at that time wrote that there had been
no cases since the review bar was put into place in
87, no cases where exceptions to review had been
recognized. He believed that it was a plenary bar on
review.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was a dissenting
opinion, and that was how many years ago? How many
years?
MR. ALLISON: Justice Ginsburg, it -- it was
a dissenting opinion, and it was in 1976, and we
certainly would not cite it as authoritative except for
our confidence in Justice Rehnquist's review of the law
as it existed at that time.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have a majority
rationale that says, although 1447(d) reads in absolute
terms, in fact the only remands that it covers are those
based on a defect in the removal or lack of subject
matter jurisdiction. So you can't say, well, Thermtron
had a result that we can limit to Thermtron's own
unusual facts because the court gave a rationale. I
mean, courts give reasons for what they do. And the
court drastically limited 1447(d) when it said 1447(d)
has to be read consonant with 1447(c), and 1447(c) deals
with only two kinds of remands, one for defective
removal and the other for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction.
MR. ALLISON: That is correct, Justice
Ginsburg. And, in fact, to harken to your earlier
question, to Your Honor's earlier question, we are not
asking for Thermtron to be overruled, but I think, in
effect, to be updated.
The Court in Thermtron did give a rationale,
and the rationale that it gave was that it viewed, the
opinion for the Court by Justice White viewed 1447(c) as
being the sole source of Federal remand power. And as
the Court noticed in the ensuing 30, 40 -- excuse me --
yes, 40-odd years, there have been a number of other
sources of remand power recognized.
And we see no reason why the holding in
Thermtron should not be overruled but be updated to
recognize that the spirit of what the Court held in that
case would be served and would be harmonized with the
review bar as it has existed lo these 120 odd-years,
would be served by expanding the -- excuse me,
contracting the reach of Thermtron so that it is not
simply 1447(c) remands, but any remand authorized by
statute.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But no matter -- no
matter what adjective or what verb you use, that's
overruling a very clear rule of Thermtron. And we
normally operate on a theory that when a conventional
statute is construed by this Court, it stays construed
until Congress changes it.
And I don't -- I don't see how you can
follow the line of reasoning that you're proposing, even
though you talk about updating and harmonizing, without
violating that basic stare decisis rule.
MR. ALLISON: It's an essential question,
Justice Souter. And I think the way we harmonize it is
to say that Thermtron has indeed been pared back by the
Court's subsequent decisions. And, of course, it is our
second argument that the Court do something with the
rule in Thermtron.
Our primary argument gets to the question of
the statutory language and whether a Cohill remand falls
within it. But our secondary argument is to say,
certainly, it's well recognized that Cohill disapproved
and pared down that portion of Thermtron that held that
the only remand power is the remand power expressed in
47(c).
And a later case, in Quackenbush, the
question of whether mandamus or appeal was the
appropriate vehicle for challenging remand orders. And
in that case, again, the Court said that we are
disavowing Thermtron's sweeping statement that mandamus
is the only vehicle for challenging a remand order.
JUSTICE SOUTER: We did -- we did not
disavow the relationship between (c) and (d).
MR. ALLISON: Indeed, the Court did not.
And we suggest again only -- it is only a suggestion in
our brief that the Court might wish to look at the
ensuing history since Thermtron and make a similar
limiting statement that recognizes that a lot of remand
authority has been established since Thermtron, and a
number of statutes by the Court's -- by the Court's
holding in Cohill.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What in addition to the
civil rights provision?
MR. ALLISON: Well, indeed in Things
Remembered, the Court was considering whether a 1447's,
comma -- whether 1447's review bar applied to a remand
under 1452. 1452 is another statute that deals with
remands in the context of cases associated with
bankruptcy issues. And in that case, there was a remand
for failing to follow a removal procedure, and the Court
held, citing Rice, United States versus Rice, based on
Congress's awareness of the universality of the review
ban. That when another statute comes in place that
provides for remand, for the review bar applies whether
or not, of course --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then that's a specific
statute that would prevail over the general provision.
MR. ALLISON: It's a little bit -- Justice
Ginsburg, it's a little bit different than the Court's
decision in Osborn, in which the much more specific
Westfall Act Provision was held to prevail over 1447.
In Things Remembered, it was simply the fact
that the review bar was held to apply to a remand, even
according -- under another statute, and, of course,
recognizing that there are now other statutory bases for
remand. The interesting thing about 1452 -- and Justice
Ginsburg, I believe you wrote the concurrence on this --
is that 1452 provides for remand on any equitable
ground, and that such remands are not subject to review
by appeal or otherwise.
So 1452, again, expresses, I think, a trend
in the thinking of Congress, if there is such a thing as
the thinking of Congress, that the review bar will be
expanded and will even include such discretionary
decisions by a district court as any equitable ground.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Things Remembered, I
think, was raised very carefully, such to say that the
question that's before the Court now has not been
decided before, the precise question here --
MR. ALLISON: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- discretionary remand?
MR. ALLISON: That is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and I think, I
looked again at Things Remembered, and it turned out to
be just as I remembered it --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that it was neutral,
colorless. It just said we haven't been confronted with
this issue. And I think Powerex said the same thing,
although it said it in more definite terms, it is far
from clear.
MR. ALLISON: That is true, and that is what
the federal circuit said -- meant when it said that
Powerex made the question precedential. Because,
certainly, if Things Remembered had decided the issue
that's before the Court today, I think the issue
wouldn't be before the Court today. And that is, of
course, why we're here.
But the Thermtron -- the Thermtron issue
really is our second argument, and the it is a very
gentle argument that the Court -- and if the Court
certainly wishes to continue discussing that, that is --
that is very profitable for what we're doing here today.
But the first argument is that, harkening
back to your original questions, Justice Ginsburg, why
shouldn't a remand when only state law claims remain in
a case, and -- Cohill 1367(c)3 why should that not come
within the language of 1447(c), what I'll call the
jurisdictional clause, because it clearly is a matter
that is only of concern to state courts -- and I think
that the Court in United Mine Workers v. Gibbs made
clear that when all State -- all the federal claims have
left the case and only State law claims remain, that
it's almost presumptive that those should be sent back.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but your opponent's
argument is that the claims that remain do include a
federal claim.
MR. ALLISON: That is true, Justice Stevens.
That is his argument. And I think what's important
about that argument is the inconsistency it sets up. It
essentially casts a net that draws in these supplemental
jurisdiction cases. And what the net does is it allows
the courts of appeals to review some artful pleading
issues, which is essentially what we have here. We have
state law claims, and our opponents are suggesting that
these are, in fact, disguised federal claims that must
be heard in federal --
JUSTICE STEVENS: What about the ruling on
the RICO claim itself? That was clearly a federal
issue.
MR. ALLISON: Yes. The RICO claim was
what -- was what gave the district court jurisdiction
over the case in the first place. And it's interesting
that in the district court's decision, it made me
think -- it made me think a little bit of the Waco case,
because in the district court's decision, the district
court very clearly said, first, I have no jurisdiction
over these State law claims, and I'm going to remand
them, and now I will turn to the RICO claim which
creates a conundrum that I'm not sure --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe the district judge
didn't say that. Maybe you can point me to the place
where it did. But if it did say it, it's flatly wrong,
because there is -- that's what supplemental
jurisdiction is. It's says you have jurisdiction, it's
a huge difference between you have no jurisdiction, you
are powerless, and you have power, but it's up to you to
exercise it or not.
MR. ALLISON: Justice Ginsburg, that's why
we didn't -- we didn't press that point because I think
-- I think that even we can see that the court exercised
its jurisdiction to decide and dismiss the RICO claim,
although it's reminiscent of -- of -- of the decision
in Kircher --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't a discretionary
decision about RICO. RICO -- there was no Federal
claims stated. That's out of it.
MR. ALLISON: Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What the district court
has jurisdiction over are the supplemental claims, which
it can choose not to exercise, but it can say, "I don't
have jurisdiction," because Congress has given
supplemental jurisdiction, but then left it to the court
to remand on stated conditions.
But you -- you seem to conflate the absence
of subject matter jurisdiction with a discretionary
decision not to exercise subject matter jurisdiction
that the court undoubtedly has.
MR. ALLISON: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I have
made every effort not to conflate those two -- those two
concepts, and in fact we did say that when -- when a
court acquires supplemental jurisdiction in a case, that
that is a species of subject matter jurisdiction at that
point, as the Court held in City of Chicago v
International College of Surgeons.
At that point the court does have a
mandatory discretion -- or mandatory jurisdiction to
exercise power over the entire Article III case; but we
then argue when the Federal claims leave the case that
jurisdiction changes. That jurisdiction changes from a
mandatory one that the court, as in Thermtron, would
certainly be concerned if the district court had -- if
jurisdiction that's mandatory. But it changes by
operation of 1367 from mandatory to discretionary; and
when Congress passed 1367 in 1990, Congress intended to
codify the existing law right up through Cohill on the
subject of supplemental jurisdiction, combining
ancillary and intended in those --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your idea is
there is jurisdiction, but when the Federal claims fall
out then there is no jurisdiction?
MR. ALLISON: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, but that seems
to me to echo the fundamental misperception that if you
have Federal jurisdiction based on a particular event --
let's say if you're dumping chemicals in the water; that
gives you a Federal cause of action; you have Federal
jurisdiction, there's a trial; it turns out you weren't
dumping chemicals with it. You don't then say "there is
no jurisdiction; there was jurisdiction before, but once
the finding is made that the facts didn't support it,
then there was no jurisdiction." You say, "there was
jurisdiction all the time and you lose."
MR. ALLISON: There was -- there was indeed
jurisdiction. And what we argue is that the nature of
the change, when it goes from mandatory, the concern of
Thermtron, to discretionary, which gives -- virtually
pushes out of the Federal Court to the State courts
anytime up until trial -- the nature of that
jurisdiction changes; and we believe that that is not
what Congress intended by the words "subject matter
jurisdiction" in 1447(c).
So if we come back to the words of the
statute, the words of the statute should be construed
broadly in order to serve the purposes of -- of remand.
The Court has made clear that concerns of comity and
federalism say that we should construe 1447 in favor of
remand and I believe that that should extend to the
concept of the whole delay of concept and shuttling.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then -- when what you are
doing is that you are using the label "subject manager
jurisdiction" in a way that seems to me, that -- there
are many categories that -- could be ambiguous at the
edges, but not subject matter jurisdiction. Subject
matter jurisdiction means court, you have no power,
period. There's no diversity, there's no Federal
question, there's no other basis for the Federal Court
to exercise jurisdiction; and to say, "Well, we can
extend the label subject matter jurisdiction to include
a case where the district court chooses not to hear
several claims, even though it has jurisdiction over
them." I think is a -- is a -- a misapplication of the
notion subject matter jurisdiction.
MR. ALLISON: It is -- it is a difficult, a
difficult conundrum. I think maybe all conundra are
difficult, but this one particularly. And, Justice
Ginsburg, in the opinion that you wrote for the Court in
the RBOC case, you very clearly pointed out that the
word "jurisdiction" is used in a variety of ways by
legal scholars --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but not subject
matter jurisdiction. Jurisdiction -- personal
jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction. When I did
in -- what I did in -- Arbaugh was explain that all
kinds of things like time limits on when you can sue,
have been labeled jurisdictional and mandatory, when
they are not. They are simply statutes of limitation.
MR. ALLISON: That -- that is correct, but
that is -- that is the nature of the problem -- that is
the nature of the problems that this Court confronted in
Kircher and Powerex -- again this is by analogy only.
We are not concerned about labels like that, if the
district court believes that it was remanding the case
because it lacked jurisdiction.
But I'm coming back to subject matter
jurisdiction, and I have found no case in this Court
that has given a definition -- Chicago with its
mandatory language was the closest I was able to find.
The Koffski case out of the Seventh Circuit
is the one case I was able to find from a higher court
that said that supplemental jurisdiction is technically
a form of subject matter jurisdiction. What we argue --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it only technical?
It says court, you can exercise power. Subject matter
jurisdiction is defined as the court has to hear a given
controversy, and under supplemental jurisdiction, there
is undoubted power in the district court to hear those
claims.
MR. ALLISON: In a -- certainly I think in a
textbook sense, that is what subject matter -- when the
world is divided between subject matter and personal and
third, territorial, which I think is a relation -- has
relation to personal -- when the world is divided along
those lines, then subject matter takes on the broadest
possible meaning, but we have conflicting broad
policies. On the one hand, we have a broad definition
of subject matter definition; on the other hand we have
a statute which should be construed to favor remand at
almost all lawful cost.
And -- and subject matter, if we step back
from our -- our dichotomy, personal and subject matter,
subject matter also means, as -- as Your Honor said at
the beginning of this argument, something that is --
that is a subject with which the Federal courts should
be concerned, and on which they should expend their
resources; and we now have the circuit courts hearing
appeals from decisions, discretionary decisions because
they are technically within the realm of subject matter
jurisdiction. But clearly, State law claims are not the
subject matter with which the Federal courts should
routinely be concerned, and that's why United Mine
Workers -- and Cohill echoed it -- says, these claims
should be sent back, and Cohill even -- both cases even
said that the propriety of remanding the claims should
be reviewed at every stage in the litigation. That --
that I think presents us a pretty strong policy by this
Court that remand is to be indulged at almost any lawful
cost.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You put it in terms in
your brief, if I understood your position correctly,
yes, there is subject matter jurisdiction over
supplemental claims, but once the district court chooses
not to exercise that jurisdiction, it -- and these were
the words you used -- it divests itself of jurisdiction.
MR. ALLISON: Yes. The -- the argument --
and I was attempting to make a technical argument in the
brief, and I think today I'm speaking in slightly more
global terms -- but the technical argument is that when
a district court makes a decision, in the words of
Gibbs, that it would be inappropriate to exercise
jurisdiction over those claims, then the claims are to
be remanded.
JUSTICE ALITO: What about if it changes its
mind?
MR. ALLISON: Justice Alito, the question of
whether a -- question of reviewability because the cases
that we found that -- that talked about reconsideration
talked about reconsideration only because there was the
potential for review of these orders.
I think the norm for a remanded case is that
the order of remand is entered, and the order of remand
is certified and mailed to the State court, and the
district court no longer has jurisdiction at that point.
Now, certainly it could reconsider as it's
engaged in its decision process. It could go back and
forth and reconsider it before it signs the order. But
that's no different than -- than many other cases in
which the court can make a discretionary decision that
it has no jurisdiction. The only --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The discretionary
decision is that it chooses not to hear the case. It's
not that -- there is no discretion there. There's
nothing discretionary about saying we have no
jurisdiction. "We have no jurisdiction" means we have
no power. So the -- the two are just at odds with each
other. No power, yes power, but we choose not to
exercise it.
MR. ALLISON: And I think -- I think that
the -- again, the purpose of the review bar as it's been
expressed for over a hundred years has been to trust
district judges to make these decisions and then get the
case where it needs to be to be resolved on its merits.
So to say that the court chooses not to hear the case,
it -- it suggests something a little bit less gray than
the decision that I believe the court would make when it
decides that it's inappropriate to hear the case, in the
words of Gibbs.
JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you think that
choosing not to hear is distinguishable from a decision
that it is inappropriate to hear?
MR. ALLISON: I -- I meant only to suggest
that it is not a -- it is not a choice. It is a -- not
a -- an ill-considered choice. Certainly, there's a
choice involved in the decision that it would be
inappropriate. But I don't see -- and I -- I wanted to
resist a rhetorical question, but then I don't see how
anyone could say when a court is faced with -- with only
State-law claims that it could either decide or not and
it decides it would be inappropriate to retain
jurisdiction over those claims, that somehow it should
retain jurisdiction over those claims.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that would argue
for a highly deferential standard of review, respecting
the district judge's determination that it's not what --
it hasn't invested any time in these questions, and it
shouldn't because they are purely state-law questions.
That's -- but that's something quite different from --
from a -- the -- the terminology that you used is
troublesome because a court doesn't have power to divest
itself of jurisdiction.
If Congress conferred jurisdiction, it has
it, and the Court can't divest itself of that. It can,
if Congress permits it, decline to exercise
jurisdiction, but a court is not capable of divesting
itself of jurisdiction.
MR. ALLISON: I believe -- well -- and --
and this is a mechanical argument, but I believe that
when the court makes the decision and then -- and then
anticipates the remand, that that is divesting itself of
jurisdiction. And perhaps it was -- perhaps it was a
poor -- a poor word choice.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But even -- even on your
analysis it seems to me that the -- the cart is before
the horse, because it is -- it is not remanding because
it does not have jurisdiction. What you are saying is
that after it remands, it loses jurisdiction, and those
are two very distinct categories.
The -- the premise for the declaration that
it does not have jurisdiction is a premise that even on
your argument does not arise until a following
agreement. So there's no way you can fit it, it seems
to me, into the category of -- of remanding because at
the point of deciding to remand it has no jurisdiction.
That, in fact, is false.
MR. ALLISON: It is simply a question, I
think, of -- of the choice of the word "divest" and what
that means. I would -- I would analogize in order to
perhaps make it seem more -- more accurate -- I would
analogize it to what a district court now can do under
section 1447(e) where it makes a decision in applying
the law and using its discretion to allow joinder of a
nondiverse party. That would then destroy diversity and
require the case to be remanded.
And I would say in that case that the court
makes a decision that divests it of jurisdiction, and it
is very technical to say that -- - that, yes, it lacks
jurisdiction as soon as it enters the order admitting
that party to the case. But that may very well be the
same order that remands the case to the State court.
But I -- I do -- I do see that there is
power. And if the case is going to turn on power, as
the Court -- or some of the language in Powerex
suggested that it might, then I don't know that we -- I
don't know that we make much headway. But I -- I -- I
see 1447(c) lacks subject-matter jurisdiction as being
broad enough to comfortably take in the situation where
the State law claims not really within the subject
matter of the district court's power are determined
inappropriate for that court to hear and sent back.
And it would bring us that much closer to
realizing the purpose of the review bar that has existed
since 1887, taking a category of cases out of the
jurisdiction of the circuit courts.
I -- I had wanted to offer the Court some
statistics, as maybe proof-of-law professors might,
about the number of cases that are heard on this type of
appeal. I can say that the cases that we found in our
footnotes 18 through 20 represent something close to the
universe of cases in which discretion was found to be
abused. And that abuse of discretion is nowhere near as
egregious as the legal errors that a district court
might commit in making erroneous judgments that it has
no jurisdiction which were nonetheless subjected to the
review bar in Kircher and Powerex.
If there are no further questions, I will
stop now.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Thank you. Mr. Rhodes, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RHODES: I just had a few quick points I
would like to bring up.
First, I would just like to reiterate that
when Congress enacted 1367, that gave it Article III
jurisdiction in those matters, just as 1331 and 1332 do.
I would also like to reiterate that -- that stare
decisis should be maintained over this statutory
interpretation because it has proved to be workable
rather than not workable.
Again, the circuit courts -- even though as
Mr. Chief Justice has iterated that they have to follow
this, they have found it to be a workable framework.
And, again, as the Court expressed in Powerex, they
agreed that in Quackenbush that Thermtron was not
altered. And Congress has -- has seemingly ratified
this Court's interpretation in Thermtron, and it has
been applied in Quackenbush.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose, though,
if it would be an abuse of discretion for the district
court to retain jurisdiction, then maybe there is --
there never was jurisdiction, right? You said they have
discretion to exercise or not. If it turns out they
don't have discretion to exercise, you know, because
it's a huge State claim and a tiny Federal claim, why
wouldn't that properly be regarded as an absence of
jurisdiction?
MR. RHODES: My response to that, Mr. Chief
Justice, is that until a court decides that it was an
abuse of discretion, the district court had jurisdiction
under 1367(c) to either exercise that power or not
exercise that power.
And unless there's any further questions for
me, I ask that the brief -- this be remanded to the
Federal circuit to decide on the merits of the appeal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:17 p.m., the case in the
