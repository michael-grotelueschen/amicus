CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 14-7955, Glossip v. Gross.
Ms. Konrad.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBIN C. KONRAD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. KONRAD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Oklahoma chooses to execute our clients with
a three-drug formula that includes a paralytic and
potassium chloride, drugs that cause intense pain and
suffering.  The second and third drugs are
constitutional only if a prisoner will not feel the pain
and be aware of the suffocation caused by those drugs.
The district court erred as a matter of law
and as a matter of fact when it found that midazolam as
the first drug is constitutionally tolerable.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is that a matter of
law?  I mean, as I see it, it's just -- just a fact
question, and -- and the district court found that it --
it did eliminate the pain.  And you're asking us to find
that the district court was clearly erroneous in that
determination?  Do we usually do that kind of thing?
MS. KONRAD:  Justice Scalia, the -- there's
a question of law and there's a question of fact.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the question of law?
MS. KONRAD:  The question of law includes
the -- the fact that the district court found that this
three-drug formula was constitutionally tolerable in
spite of two facts, the first one being that there is a
medical consensus that this drug cannot be used as the
sole drug --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a question of fact.
That's a question of fact.
MS. KONRAD:  That --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying the question
of law is that the -- the district court ignored two
facts.  Ignoring two facts does not make it a question
of law; it's still a question of fact.
MS. KONRAD:  The -- if -- if I can, Justice
Scalia, the second point is the question of law also
involves that the district court found that this drug
creates a greater risk of harm than sodium thiopental,
but that it could not quantify.  So it found that this
drug that creates a greater risk of harm that it could
not quantify and it also had before it evidence that
this drug is not used for the purpose that -- which the
State intends it to be used.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you -- the way
I've thought of this -- and I know that in your brief
you think de novo review goes to everything.  If I
disagree with you, if I think that I have to give
deference to the district court's factual finding on how
this drug works, the -- how do you call it -- the --
MS. KONRAD:  The midazolam.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Midazolam, but that it's
a legal question of whether how that drug works creates
a risk of harm that's constitutionally intolerable.  Is
that how you divide up the legal end?
MS. KONRAD:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor, and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the facts are now.
Now let's go to my real question, okay?  That a judge
ignores evidence is not necessarily an abuse of
discretion or a clear error.  But -- so what are the
clear errors in terms of the reasoning that the district
court used?
MS. KONRAD:  So the clear errors in this
case, we have to look at what this case is about.  And
this case is about known information and undisputed
facts that were before the court.  This drug, midazolam,
is in a different class than barbiturates, this drug is
not known, it's not a pain reliever.  The district court
recognized these two facts at 76 of the Joint Appendix.
It's known that this drug has a ceiling
effect, so there's a certain point at which giving more
of the drug is not going to matter.  The district court
recognized that at 78.  The State's expert recognized
that.  The Petitioners' experts recognized that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but what the
district court determined is that it was -- was not able
to tell precisely when the ceiling effect kicked in,
precisely when they hit the ceiling, right?
MS. KONRAD:  That is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that -- that is
your theory for when pain is possible, when it hits the
ceiling, right?
MS. KONRAD:  What the district court found,
Mr. Chief Justice, is whatever the ceiling effect may
be, it takes effect only at the spinal cord and that 500
milligrams of midazolam will, quote, "create a
phenomenon which is not anesthesia," but effectively
paralyzes the brain and eliminates awareness of pain.
Now, that finding, we have to -- we have to
look at what undisputed facts were before the court in
making that finding to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, is it
undisputed facts?  I thought you had the burden of
showing that the determinations were clearly erroneous.
So it's certainly not a case where the facts have to be
undisputed.
MS. KONRAD:  And I'm sorry if I misspoke,
Mr. Chief Justice.  What we have to look at before in
order to show why this was a clearly erroneous finding
is what the undisputed facts were before the district
court in order for it to reach that conclusion.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you even have to go
that far?  The State here doesn't even propose that
their doctor was right on this point.
MS. KONRAD:  Well, that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They're not defending
it, they don't say it's true.  They -- I -- conceded,
as I read their brief, that it does not work the way
the doctor said it worked, that it does not paralyze
the brain, correct?
MS. KONRAD:  That is correct, Justice
Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it's clear error.
Now we've got an admission that the expert
was plainly wrong.  So how -- what else, I guess --
there was nothing else that the district court could
have based its conclusion on, correct?
MS. KONRAD:  That is correct.  And -- and
the -- the district court reached this decision based
on no scientific evidence and with a medical consensus
to the contrary that this drug is not able to
pharmacologically do what the States' expert said that
it could in fact do.  And that clear error is
combined -- and as the district court said at Joint
Appendix 47, that this is partially a mixed question of
fact and mixed question of law.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Konrad, can I make sure
I understand this because, you know, I read that -- the
part of the opinion that you're referring to and I just
really couldn't figure it out.
So is it that the court said, well, we don't
know what the ceiling effect is generally, but the
ceiling effect only goes to how something operates at
the spinal cord level, it doesn't go to how it operates
at the brain and this -- and -- this -- this takes --
what we -- what we care about is how it operates at the
brain, so we don't even have to worry about ceiling
effect; is that right?
MS. KONRAD:  That's --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that --
MS. KONRAD:  That is --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that what the court said?
MS. KONRAD:  Justice Kagan, that is what the
district court found based on the testimony of the
State's experts that's not supported by any scientific
literature, any -- any medical information and, in fact,
is inconsistent with the State's expert's own testimony.
Because he testified and explained that the way this
drug works is it works throughout the central nervous
system.  He said --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you're saying we do have
to worry about the ceiling effect.  There isn't this
dichotomy between the drug at the spinal cord and the
drug at the brain, and the -- it's actually crucial what
kind of ceiling effect this drug has in -- in
contradiction to what the court said, which was we
didn't have to worry about ceiling effect.  Is that --
MS. KONRAD:  That --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that how it goes?
MS. KONRAD:  Yes, Justice Kagan.  And
this --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Did you introduce any
evidence to show the dosage at which the ceiling effect
would occur?
MS. KONRAD:  We had testimony from our
expert who -- who indicated that it could be calculated,
but it was not calculated.  But, Justice Alito, that
doesn't matter because what matters is that we know that
the drug has a ceiling effect, and that is what matters.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the ceiling
effect is 1,000 milligrams?
MS. KONRAD:  There is no evidence in the
record to support that.  And in fact --
JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  I'm just saying is
there any evidence to show that it is any amount below
500?
MS. KONRAD:  It doesn't matter.  It
doesn't --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Of course it matters.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the one proof we
do have is the Wood execution, not the one that was
botched, but Mr. Wood was given 750 milligrams, correct?
MS. KONRAD:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And he laid writhing in
pain for 20 minutes?  25 minutes?  I don't remember how
long.
MS. KONRAD:  Mr. Wood was 2 hours.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, 2 hours.
Now, there's been some defense that the 750 wasn't
immediately delivered, but it was still 750 that went
into his system and caused that kind of pain, correct?
MS. KONRAD:  Yes.  And our expert testified
that Mr. Wood's execution demonstrates the ceiling
effect; that giving more of this drug is not going to
put a prisoner into a deep coma-like --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how many executions
have been carried out using this drug?
MS. KONRAD:  Using midazolam?
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.
MS. KONRAD:  15.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  And you're talking
about one.
MS. KONRAD:  No, we're actually talking of
several executions that -- the execution in this case,
in Oklahoma, that happened a year ago of Mr. Lockett
demonstrates why midazolam is not a proper drug that can
do what the State intends it to do and put a prisoner in
a deep coma-like unconscious.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought there were
issues of the administration of the drug, you know,
the -- the nature of the veins and so forth.  Weren't
those present or have I got a different one in mind than
the Lockett case?
MS. KONRAD:  No, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No?  I'm sorry.
"No" what?  That was not that or -- were -- were there
issues about -- I thought there were issues involving
the veins and the ability to make an intravenous
connection?
MS. KONRAD:  There were problems with the
catheter, but -- but Mr. Lockett received enough
midazolam such that he was unconscious and the doctor --
the physician executioner found that he was unconscious
and then he regained consciousness.  And that is the key
issue here before this Court, that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not if he didn't -- not if
he didn't receive the proper dosage.  So you're saying
it's okay that he didn't receive the proper dosage so
long as he was unconscious.
MS. KONRAD:  He --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I don't see how
that follows.  I mean, if in fact the execution was not
properly conducted, I don't see how you can blame it on
the -- on the drug.
MS. KONRAD:  What we know about this drug,
Justice Scalia, is that it can never maintain the deep
coma-like unconsciousness that is necessary to prevent
a prisoner from feeling the painful effects of the --
I'm sorry, of the potassium chloride.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  How do we know that?  I
thought that what we knew was something different.  I
thought that what we knew was just what we can't know;
in other words, that there's this huge range of
uncertainty about what happens when somebody is -- is
given this drug.
You're suggesting something more than that,
which is that we know what happens, we know that the
drug can't maintain deep -- deep unconsciousness.
Which -- which is right?
MS. KONRAD:  Justice Kagan, we know because
of the pharmacological properties of this drug, the way
that -- that when the drug was being tested and being
introduced, it is not used for the sole purpose of
preventing somebody from feeling pain during a painful
procedure.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I thought it wasn't
used for that purpose just because we don't know whether
it's capable of being used for that purpose, as opposed
to we know it's incapable of being used for that
purpose, if you see the difference.
MS. KONRAD:  I do see the difference, but I
think what's important here is this Court in Baze
explained that it's important to reemphasize that a
proper dose of sodium thiopental obviates the concern
that the prisoner will not be sufficiently sedated.
That was the key aspect of Baze.  And in --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And why is Oklahoma not
using sodium thiopental?  Why is it not using that drug?
MS. KONRAD:  It isn't using it -- you'll --
you could ask my friend here, but --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You don't know?
MS. KONRAD:  The -- the finding here is that
it was unavailable at that time of the hearing.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  I mean, let's be
honest about what's going on here.  Executions could be
carried out painlessly.  There are many jurisdictions --
there are jurisdictions in this country, there are
jurisdictions abroad that allow assisted suicide, and I
assume that those are carried out with little, if any,
pain.  Oklahoma and other States could carry out
executions painlessly.
Now, this Court has held that the death
penalty is constitutional.  It's controversial as a
constitutional matter.  It certainly is controversial as
a policy matter.  Those who oppose the death penalty are
free to try to persuade legislatures to abolish the
death penalty.  Some of those efforts have been
successful.  They're free to ask this Court to overrule
the death penalty.
But until that occurs, is it appropriate for
the judiciary to countenance what amounts to a guerilla
war against the death penalty which consists of efforts
to make it impossible for the States to obtain drugs
that could be used to carry out capital punishment with
little, if any, pain?  And so the States are reduced to
using drugs like this one which give rise to disputes
about whether, in fact, every possibility of pain is
eliminated.
Now, what is your response to that?
MS. KONRAD:  Well, Justice Alito, the
purpose of the courts is to decide whether a method of
execution or the way that the State is going to carry
out an execution is, in fact, constitutional, and it --
whether we're going to tolerate -- is it objectively
intolerable to allow the States to carry out a method in
this way.  And so --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I guess -- I guess I
would be more inclined to find that it was intolerable
if there was even some doubt about this drug when there
was a perfectly safe other drug available.  But the
States have gone through two different drugs, and those
drugs have been rendered unavailable by the abolitionist
movement putting pressure on the companies that
manufacture them so that the States cannot obtain those
two other drugs.
And now you want to come before the Court
and say, well, this third drug is not 100 percent sure.
The reason it isn't 100 percent sure is because the
abolitionists have rendered it impossible to get the
100 percent sure drugs, and you think we should not view
that as -- as relevant to the decision that -- that
you're putting before us?
MS. KONRAD:  Justice Scalia, I don't think
that it's relevant to the decision as to what's
available because what this Court needs to look at is
whether the drug that the State is intending to use to
cause what they say is a -- put the prisoner in a -- in
a place where he will not feel pain, that that drug is
good enough.  This drug is anything --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor, I --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is any State -- is any
State using a lethal injection protocol without this
questionable drug?  We know that two are not available.
Is there another combination that has been used by
States that doesn't involve this questionable drug?
MS. KONRAD:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  And, in
fact, there have been 11 executions using pentobarbital
just this year by other States.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But is that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That doesn't answer
Justice Scalia's and Justice Alito's question.  The
question is:  What bearing, if any, should we put on the
fact that there is a method, but that it's not available
because of -- because of opposition to the death
penalty?  What relevance does that have?  None?
MS. KONRAD:  Justice Kennedy, the fact that
the State chooses a certain method should not -- should
not have bearing on whether that method is
constitutional.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, if there is
no --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I would like an
answer to the question.  You've been interrupted several
times, and you still haven't given -- is it relevant or
not?
MS. KONRAD:  No.  It's not relevant.  The
availability of another --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There are other ways to
kill people regrettably.
MS. KONRAD:  There are,  Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That are painless.  It
doesn't have to be a drug protocol that we elect that
has a substantial risk of burning a person alive who's
paralyzed, correct?
MS. KONRAD:  That is correct, Justice
Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know that you'll get
up and argue that those other ways are -- are not
constitutional either potentially, but people do that
with every protocol.  But the little bit of research
I've done has shown that the reason people don't use the
other methods it's because it offends them to look at
them.  Like you could use gas, that renders people not
even knowing that they're going to sleep to die.  And
people probably don't want to use that protocol because
of what happened during World War II.  But there are
alternatives.  Oklahoma has found some.  It's -- it can
use the -- a firing squad now.
So I don't know what the absence of a drug,
what pertinence it has when alternatives exist.
MS. KONRAD:  I would agree, Justice
Sotomayor, that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Doesn't -- doesn't a
firing squad cause pain?
MS. KONRAD:  Justice Ginsburg, we don't
know -- we don't know how, if the State chose to carry
out an execution by firing squad, whether, in fact, it
would cause -- rise to the level of unconstitutional
pain and suffering under the Eighth Amendment.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you don't
know.  Do you have a guess?  I mean, is there a reason
that the States moved progressively to what I understand
to be more humane methods of execution?  Hanging, firing
squad, electric chair, death -- you know, gas chamber?
MS. KONRAD:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And -- and you're
not suggesting that those other methods are preferable
to the method in this case, are you?
MS. KONRAD:  I'm not suggesting that, Mr.
Chief Justice, but the reason why States moved to more
humane methods is, as we learn more, and as we learn
more about science, and develop, then, as a society, we
move forward.  We have evolving standards of decency.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you have no
suggestion as what -- to what would be an acceptable
alternative to what you propose right now for Oklahoma.
Do you have any -- I mean, the case comes to us in a
posture where it's recognized that your client is guilty
of a capital offense, it's recognized that your client
is eligible for the death penalty, that that has been
duly imposed.  And yet you put us in a position with
your argument that he can't be executed, even though he
satisfies all of those requirements.
MS. KONRAD:  I would --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you have no
suggested alternative that is more humane.
MS. KONRAD:  I would actually disagree with
the characterization that it's -- that he can't be
executed.  Oklahoma has just passed a new statute, and
they are continuously looking for methods and ways to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What does the new
statute provide?
MS. KONRAD:  The new statute provides that
if the lethal injection protocol is found
unconstitutional, or drugs are unavailable, then they
can go to other methods.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What other method?
MS. KONRAD:  They go to nitrogen gas, and
then go to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And are you
suggesting that that's okay with you?
MS. KONRAD:  I'm not -- I don't know
anything about that protocol.  They have not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what do you
think?  Do you have an instinct about whether or not the
gas chamber is preferable to this lethal injection or
not?
MS. KONRAD:  Mr. Chief Justice, it's hard
for me in the abstract to say whether it's preferable.
The -- the legislature has said that this could be a
painless method.  I don't know -- they haven't come out
with any information about how it will be carried out.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose it were true --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If I understand the facts
here, your client was already in jail with a life
sentence, right, for murder?  And while in jail on that
life sentence, he stabbed and killed a prison guard, and
that's the crime for which Oklahoma is seeking to
execute him.  That's the facts we have before us, isn't
it?
MS. KONRAD:  One of the Petitioners here
before the Court, but --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Perhaps there is that
larger question, that if, in fact, for whatever set of
reasons, it's not you, you didn't purposely hide these
other kinds of drugs, if there is no method of executing
a person that does not cause unacceptable pain, that, in
addition to other things, might show that the death
penalty is not consistent with the Eighth Amendment.  Is
that so or not, in your opinion?
MS. KONRAD:  That -- that perhaps could be
true, Justice Breyer, but the narrow issue --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And is that -- is that your
argument?
MS. KONRAD:  No.
JUSTICE ALITO:  You're marking -- you can
make one of two arguments.  And one is that the death
penalty is unconstitutional because there is no method
that has been used in the past or that can be devised
that is capable of carrying that sentence out without
inflicting some pain, pain that's unacceptable.  That's
an argument that you can make.  But I don't understand
you to be making that argument; am I right?
MS. KONRAD:  You are correct, Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So you are arguing -- you
want us to reverse a finding of fact of the district
court on the ground that it is clearly erroneous.  When
was the last time we did that?
MS. KONRAD:  The Court in Comcast in -- we
cited that opinion, it was a few years ago, and
explained that where there are clearly -- clearly
erroneous findings.  In this case, this is obviously an
exceptionally erroneous.  Looking at the -- the findings
based on no scientific evidence, no studies, and all of
the evidence shows that this drug does not work in the
way that the State intended it to work.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But 500 milligrams is a
lethal dose, isn't it?
MS. KONRAD:  That --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Itself it's capable of
causing death; is that right?
MS. KONRAD:  That, I don't know, Justice
Alito, that -- if the -- the expert who testified for
the State talked about a potential toxic dose, but
there's no information of -- of, yes, this dose will
cause death.  We don't know that, and that's not --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Does the --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- isn't there a therapeutic
dose -- is there -- is it ever administered in that
quantity for any therapeutic reason?
MS. KONRAD:  No, but --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Does the fact that something
is a lethal dose necessarily mean that it's not
incredibly painful?
MS. KONRAD:  No, Justice Kagan, and that's
--
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It could be a lethal dose
and be incredibly painful.
JUSTICE ALITO:  No, that -- but that's not
the point.  The point is, if it's a lethal dose, or it's
potentially a lethal dose, then how are you going to do
a study to determine whether, in fact, it renders the
person insensate?
MS. KONRAD:  Justice Alito, you don't need
to do a study in this case because we already know from
science and the pharmacology of the drug, how the drug
works.  And so that's what the district court got wrong,
and there's clear error here.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it -- now let's get to
that -- I'd like to get --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, maybe to the extent
that you can't --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan, I
think it's your turn.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Please, go ahead.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'd just like -- since
we're on the narrow question.  The narrow question that
you want to present, I would like to hear the argument.
As far as I know, we held in Baze in this context that
if a person is not rendered unconscious where the other
two drugs come in, there is a constitutionally
unacceptable risk of suffocation and pain.  That's the
holding.
And in this case, the court of appeals says
that the district court found that this drug that you're
talking about, midazolam, will result in central nervous
depression, rendering the person unconscious and
insensate during the rest of the procedure, a sufficient
level of unconsciousness to resist the major stimuli of
the later two drugs.  That's his finding.
You had an expert testify that that is not
the case.  That expert said that -- I'm citing an
article.  He said that it would not reliably put the
person in a coma.  Isn't that what he said?
MS. KONRAD:  That is correct, Justice
Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Then the other
side produced the expert which just said the contrary.
All right.  So you have to say that that conclusion,
namely, quote, the 500 milligrams will be at a -- will
make it a virtual certainty that he will be at a
sufficient level of unconsciousness to resist the
stimuli of the other two drugs.  So I'm sorry, you
don't -- I've run out of your time.  Maybe I'll ask the
other side the same question.  I want to know what
underlies that sufficient to make you say, clearly
wrong.  But the other side is just as good to ask that
question.  And I want you to reserve your time.
MS. KONRAD:  Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Wyrick.
MR. WYRICK:  That's better.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You could ask me, maybe.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Wyrick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK R. WYRICK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WYRICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The district court found, as a matter of
fact, that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam would, with
near certainty, render these Petitioners unconscious and
unable to feel pain.  Now, regardless of our other
disagreements about proper legal standards, all parties
agree that Petitioners bear the threshold burden of
establishing that there is a substantial or objectively
intolerable risk that they will feel the pain from the
second and third drugs.
Unless that finding of fact, a finding of
fact affirmed by the court of appeals, mirrored by three
other trial courts in Florida, affirmed by three other
appeals courts in Florida, is set aside, they cannot
satisfy that threshold burden.  Now --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Wyrick, as -- as I
understand it, there were three subsidiary findings that
underlay this conclusion.
The first is the one that we talked a little
bit about with Ms. Konrad, which has to do with the
ceiling effect, which, as I understand it you, don't at
all defend.
The second is the idea that 500 milligrams
of this drug would likely kill a patient in 30 minutes
or an hour, which seems to me irrelevant given that a
lethal dose is completely consistent with unbearable
pain.
And the third is that that dose of midazolam
would keep a patient unconscious while a needle is
inserted into his thigh, which also seems irrelevant
given the -- what everybody understands to be the much,
much, much greater potential for pain of potassium
chloride.
So those were the three subsidiary findings.
One of them nobody thinks is anything other than
gobbledygook, and the other two are irrelevant.  Is that
not the case?
MR. WYRICK:  Well, I'm going to take those
in reverse order.  I -- I think the third actually is
relevant.  These Petitioners, in their amended
complaint, at paragraph 139, described the setting of a
femoral IV as an invasive surgical procedure involving
not just pain, great pain.  That's how they described
it.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it does not sound
pleasant to have a needle put in your thigh.  But when
you read these descriptions of what midazolam does, that
it gives the feeling of being burned alive, it sounds
really considerably more than having a needle put in
your thigh.
MR. WYRICK:  And -- and this is what I want
to clarify as to your first point.  Midazolam itself,
there is no evidence and no one -- no one argues that it
causes any pain upon -- upon injection.  It is a
sedative hypnotic.  It is the second and third drug --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, no, no.  I'm sorry.
Potassium chloride.
MR. WYRICK:  -- it's talking about.  So, you
know, earlier some of the questions you said about
whether this is lethal or not is irrelevant because it
would involve great pain, no, a lethal dose of
midazolam would not cause pain.  It -- it -- just not --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, no, no.
MR. WYRICK:  It's a central --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's --
MR. WYRICK:  -- nervous system --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, no, no.  That's not --
that's not the point.  It's a lethal dose of
potassium -- of midazolam, it will take 30 minutes to
die.  In the meantime, the potassium chloride can be
wreaking extraordinary pain on the individual.  So in
that sense, the fact that this is a lethal dose of
midazolam has nothing to do with the question that is
before us, whether, before that 30 minutes or hour
passes, the potassium chloride is wreaking unbearable
pain on the individual.
MR. WYRICK:  The question before the Court
is whether the district court's factual finding that
they would be unconscious and insensate is clearly
erroneous.
And on that point, let's look at the record
case that these Petitioners put on before the district
court.  They said that there were three reasons why
midazolam was inappropriate.
They said paradoxical reactions.  Those have
disappeared from the case.  You won't even see those in
the reply brief.  We pointed out that they're
extraordinarily rare, and to the extent that they
happen, trained medical -- our trained medical staff
would catch those and never call the person unconscious.
Secondly, they said lack of -- lack of
analgesia.  We pointed out sodium thiopental and
pentobarbital, those weren't analgesics either.  That's
never been relevant to the question because the question
is, does the drug render them unconscious and insensate.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would any doctor -- would
any doctor --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  They are pain relief
medications.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what's the third
point you had?  I -- I was anxious to hear your third
point.
question?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  As was I.
MR. WYRICK:  In response to Justice Kagan's
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
MR. WYRICK:  Yes.  Your -- I forget now your
second point, your -- the second factual finding or
second underpinning --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know --
MR. WYRICK:  -- which was a factual
finding --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  There is --
MR. WYRICK:  -- but --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  There is the fact that this
is a lethal dose, again, completely consistent with the
possibility of potassium chloride causing great pain.
There is the fact that it rendered -- it keeps a patient
unconscious with a needle, completely consistent with it
not keeping a patient unconscious with potassium
chloride running through his body, and, again, this --
this statement that nobody can figure out about the
ceilingeffect.
MR. WYRICK:  Right.  And it's the ceiling
effect that I want to focus on, because the -- what the
district court said is whatever the ceiling effect may
be, what we're concerned about is whether this can keep
someone unconscious and unaware of pain.  And what he
talked about that's the phenomenon that's not
anesthesia, what he was referring to is their expert,
Dr. Lubarsky, he said in the medical sense, to have true
anesthesia, you have to have unconsciousness, inability
to feel pain and immobility.
Our district court was saying, well, what we
care about with midazolam is it -- will it render them
unconscious and unable to feel pain.  Under their
expert's definition, they may not -- that may not be
anesthesia in the medical sense, but it's the
constitutionally relevant question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do we do with this
brief of the pharmacology professors that state, flat
out, midazolam cannot induce coma-like unconsciousness?
MR. WYRICK:  They actually go further and
say, you know, in several respects that it can induce
unconsciousness, and that's something that no one agrees
with.  Even the FDA label indicates that induction of
anesthesia is a commonly accepted use.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Can I -- can I ask --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- what's the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- the same question, which
is I -- I've had this one question, and that is, as I
read this record -- you remember what I said was the
standard from Baze.  You remember what I said was the
district court's finding.  You remember that I believe
that what this is about is whether that finding is
clearly erroneous.  And what I have are two sentences.
The first sentence is from their expert.
And he, quote, when you could be unconscious, he means
that this drug, midazolam, is an antianxiety drug, like
Xanax.  People use it to go to sleep every night, and it
can render you unconscious and not reacting to minor
stimuli.  That's their expert.
But when major stimuli such as the
introduction of the next two drugs that we're talking
about here come into play, you are jolted into
consciousness, and you are quite aware, and you wake up.
Now, if we stop there, you'd lose, right?
MR. WYRICK:  If any of that were --
JUSTICE BREYER:  If we stop there.
MR. WYRICK:  If any of that were supported
by the medical literature.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But he pointed to -- he
pointed to two articles.  He based that statement -- but
I'll look at the two articles.  It seemed to me he was
basing the statement on medical articles, but, okay, we
have to look at the support for that.
MR. WYRICK:  Yes.  And, Justice --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now let's look at the other
side, because your side then says -- he says right here
that -- he says it will put you into a coma.  That's his
point.  But his reasoning was that if you take enough of
it, you'll be dead.  And then he says this is
essentially an extrapolation from a toxic effect, by
which he means if you take a lot, you'll be dead, but
before you're dead, you're in a coma.  And that's his
reasoning.  And I didn't find any other reasoning.
Now, the obvious thing -- are two.  One, a
lot of things kill you without putting you into a coma,
such as the next two drugs.  Lots of things do.  And,
two, he didn't point to anything in support of this
putting into a coma.  It was just the extrapolation.
Now, that's what I want you to focus on,
because if what I've just said is correct, then I think
there is no support in this record for his conclusion.
If what I have said is incorrect, there might be
support.
MR. WYRICK:  Well, a couple of things.
First, that assumes that a deep coma-like level of
unconsciousness is the relevant question.  They argue
that this Court's cases and the Constitution requires
that.
Now, that's beyond a surgical plane of
anesthesia that we would use in an operating room to
remove one of your limbs.  A coma is -- is brain-dead,
EEG silence.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would any doctor --
MR. WYRICK:  It's beyond --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- use this drug -- any
doctor who is conducting a surgical procedure, doesn't
want the patient to suffer pain, wants to induce this
unconscious state, would any doctor in the country give
this as the drug to induce that -- that coma-like
unconsciousness?
MR. WYRICK:  It is routinely used to induce
anesthesia.  It is not commonly used anymore for the
maintenance of anesthesia for -- for hours for
surgeries.  Now, their source, this is the Saari
article, and that's spelled S-A-A-R-I, that their expert
cited -- and you can find this in the JA at 2-43 in his
report.  He cited this article.  And if you actually
read the article, it explains why midazolam is no longer
used for maintenance of general anesthesia.  It says,
and I'm quoting, "Midazolam has been used to induce and
maintain general anesthesia.  The recovery period of
midazolam is approximately three times longer than
propofol."  Propofol is the drug that's more commonly
used now.  "Therefore the genuine use of midazolam is
the sole induction and maintenance agent for general
anesthesia.  It is nowadays exceptionally uncommon and
has been replaced by induction and maintenance of
fusions of propofol.  For organizational and economic
reasons, fast-track recovery has gained popularity.
That's why midazolam" --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I have a real
problem with whatever you're reading, because I'm going
to have to go back to that article.  I am substantially
disturbed that in your brief you made factual statements
that were not supported by the cited -- of those sources
and in fact directly contradicted.
I'm going to give you just three small
examples among many I found.  So nothing you say or read
to me am I going to believe, frankly, until I see it
with my own eyes the context, okay?
I'll give you a -- the three examples.  On
pages 4 and 5 of your brief you cite, "This drug's FDA
approved label as holding that" -- "that this drug can
get you to mild sedation and to deep levels of sedation
virtually equivalent to the state of general anesthesia
where the patient may require external support for vital
functions."
But this quote was not on general use.  This
quote came from the section of the FDA label where it
was saying that this drug's effects, when taken with
other drugs that suppress the central nervous system,
this can happen.  That to me is -- really there is no
other central nervous system drug at play in this
protocol.
On page 6, you cite the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have an answer to
that one?
MR. WYRICK:  Respectfully, Justice
Sotomayor, in the brief we explained that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, sir.  Go --
MR. WYRICK:  The FDA -- the FDA label says
that the effects of the drug depend upon three things:
The rate of infusion -- I think it's the -- the
maintenance -- the infusion -- the rate -- the dosage of
the rate of infusion and whether it's used in
conjunction with other CNS depressants and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you didn't -- you
quoted this for the proposition that it could cause a
fatality  because of the depression of -- or it could
produce general anesthesia.
MR. WYRICK:  At JA 217, their expert agrees
that it can cause a fatality.  He agrees that it caused
80 fatalities.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sure, but he said it's
in old people.
I'm -- you know, there have been 80 deaths
from therapeutic doses of this drug.  It's -- this is
almost like you saying because 80 people have died from
the use of one aspirin, that means that if I give people
100 aspirins, they're going to die.  It's just not
logical.  Obviously, people die from anything that you
give them, that's why there are hospital fatalities in
every procedure and why there's -- that -- but 80 among
the millions that are given this drug don't die.
So my point is, what -- the FDA is saying
the general anesthesia effect is only going to happen
when you have a central nervous drug -- central nervous
system drug.
MR. WYRICK:  The FDA has said no such thing.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, they put it in
that section.
MR. WYRICK:  They described in that section
the potential effects and they described -- they said 3
things matter when you're looking at the effects.  How
much of the drug you're giving, the rate at which you're
giving it, and whether it's given with another drug.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.
MR. WYRICK:  Now, their -- their expert
said -- unqualifiedly he said the FDA tested this drug
and injected --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Let me give
you a second example:  The Melvin study.  The Melvin
study says this is how it happened.  It gave this drug
in doses of .02 to .06, and what it showed was that at
.06 dose, there was less effect than at .02.
And he said, this suggests that there is a
ceiling effect to this drug and that it is less potent
as you go in higher doses.
Now, you quoted for saying -- and you took
out the eclipse -- there may be a ceiling -- you quote
it by saying that, "The Melvin study for the position
that studies on humans have found that the anesthetic
effect of midazolam increased linearly with dosage and
estimate that 2 milligrams is enough for full surgical
anesthetic."
But what Melvin actually said, after
pointing out that the ceiling effect is shown by his
study, he says, "But presuming there were no ceiling
effect, extrapolation of our data suggests that such a
dose would be sufficient."  You took out that --
MR. WYRICK:  Respectfully, Justice
Sotomayor, what they were comparing was a .2 milligram
per kilogram dose of a different drug to a .6 milligram
dose -- per kilogram dose of midazolam.  They said we
would have expected midazolam to have a greater effect
than the other drug because it's more potent than the
other drug.  But as it turns out, there's two things
going on.  Either there's some dose-dependent
relationship with the other drug, or they said, there
may be some ceiling effect here.  They -- they
hypothesized that there may be.
They say if there's not a ceiling effect and
you extrapolate out what we know about the drug, you get
the full anesthesia 2 milligrams per kilogram.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, we're back.  Well,
we're back to is their a ceiling effect?  The judge here
said, does it matter?
MR. WYRICK:  And let's talk about their
evidence.  First of all, neither of their experts could
say at what level a ceiling effect occurs.  And it's not
relevant whether there is or is not a ceiling effect.
Their expert said all drugs have a ceiling effect at
some point.
What matters is, is there a ceiling effect
that kicks in before we get to a level where they're
unconscious and unaware of the pain?  That's the
constitutionally relevant inquiry.  And on this point,
they presented the district court with two pieces of
evidence:  Dr. Lubarsky, a Material Safety Data Sheet
for midazolam, that as we pointed out in our brief,
never even mentioned ceiling effect.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Mr. Wyrick, it would be
very different if the court had said, look, we don't
think you've presented enough evidence that the ceiling
effect kicks in at this point, right?  But that's not
what the court said.  The court had this alternative
theory, which is that it didn't have to concern itself
with whether the ceiling effect had kicked in.  And
that's the thing that not -- you don't defend as well.
But that was what the court said.
MR. WYRICK:  I -- I -- that's not quite how
we read the district court's opinion.  What we said --
he recounted their explanation of what the ceiling
effect was -- I think this is at JA 77 or 78 -- and
says whatever it may be with respect to anesthesia, he
said, which occurs at the spinal cord level, he said --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Whatever it might be,
we don't have to worry about it because all we have to
worry about is the brain and not the spinal cord, and in
the brain, there is no ceiling effect.  And that's just
wrong.  You know that's wrong.
MR. WYRICK:  We know the central nervous
system depressant works throughout the central nervous
system, right?  So it -- it's affecting these GABA
receptors which are located in the spinal cord and in
the brain.
Now, his point was perhaps those GABA
receptors could be fully saturated with GABA at the
spinal cord level, but the question is at the brain
level.  Are we, in his words, paralyzing the brain to
such an extent that the person is unconscious and
unaware of pain?  And he said he thought the evidence
was sufficient to -- to conclude that it was.  And we
look at the evidence --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I just read it -- I
think if we go back and read it, it will show that what
he was saying was we just don't have to worry about the
ceiling effect because at the brain level, the ceiling
effect has no relevance.
Let me ask you another question.  Maybe this
is one we'll agree on.  Maybe not.  I'm not sure.
Do you think that if we conclude that there
is just a lot of uncertainty about this drug, in other
words, you know, you might be right, or Ms. Konrad might
be right, and it's really just impossible to tell.
Given that nobody does studies on this drug, it would be
unethical to do studies on this drug, we simply can't
know the answer to these questions.  If that's the state
of the world, do you think it's a violation of the
Eighth Amendment to use it?
MR. WYRICK:  If there is a risk of serious
pain that rises to a substantial or objectively
intolerable.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  Well, you're just
repeating the standard.  But I'm giving you a set of --
we just don't know.  It might be substantial pain; it
might not be substantial pain.  I mean, we can't -- we
can't -- we can't quantify it at all.
MR. WYRICK:  If what you're suggesting is
shifting the burden to the State to show that there's
some medical consensus that a drug can, in fact, do this
at these dosages, we know that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm not talking
about burdens.  I'm talking about a district court who's
presented with evidence.  Just put yourself in the
position of a district judge.  And the evidence is who
can tell?  Nobody can tell.  What is a district court
supposed to do at that point?
MR. WYRICK:  Well, this Court in Brewer v.
Landrigan, which was an appeal from the Ninth Circuit in
a -- of a similarly postured case, it was a temporary
injunction, that was a challenge to the efficacy of
lethal injection drugs vacated a -- a temporary
injunction granted by lower courts and said the burden
is on the petitioner to show that it is sure or very
likely that they will suffer from the harm.  They said
speculative evidence isn't enough.  So that's the burden
that they bear.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So then I think I have not
found a place where I agree with you, because that
seems -- that seems quite something to me.  I mean, that
would be like saying -- people say that this potassium
chloride, it's like being burned alive.  We've actually
talked about being burned at the stake, and -- and
everybody agrees that that's cruel and unusual
punishment.
So suppose that we said, we're going to burn
you at the stake, but before we do, we're going to use
an anesthetic of completely unknown properties and
unknown effects.  Maybe you won't feel it, maybe you
will.  We just can't tell.  And -- and you think that
that would be okay.
MR. WYRICK:  I think that that -- a
Petitioner in that case would have no trouble meeting --
satisfying the burden this Court imposed in Baze, which
is showing that that puts me at a substantial risk,
objectively intolerable risk of severe pain.  That --
that threshold showing would be incredibly easy to make
in that case.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I'm -- I'm saying,
because you just don't know about the anesthesia.  Maybe
the anesthesia will cover all that -- the pain of being
burned at the stake or maybe it won't.  The court
doesn't know.
MR. WYRICK:  That isn't the world that we
live in, and it's certainly not the world that this
district court lived in.  We know -- we know for a fact,
these are the conceded facts.  Their expert said, this
dosage of midazolam will render these Petitioners
unconscious in no more than 60 to 90 seconds.  We know
that induction of anesthesia is an FDA-approved
indication for this drug.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Induction, but not
maintenance.
MR. WYRICK:  For certain, yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And there is the world of
difference between the two, isn't there?
MR. WYRICK:  Induction is the creation of
anesthesia.  Maintenance is the keeping it at that state
for many hours for a surgery.  That's not -- we're
not --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Or for -- or for the time it
takes for the potassium chloride to kill somebody.
MR. WYRICK:  And we also put on evidence
that this drug is approved for usage and is commonly
used for painful, invasive procedures like setting of a
femoral IV.  I think the intubation example is a very
good example, because we pointed out that this drug,
midazolam, is regularly and routinely used for rapid
sequence intubation.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What you have here, their
expert saying, as I previously said, that this drug will
not keep you asleep.  Once these two others are
introduced, you will be jolted into consciousness; that
is his testimony.  I believe he supported that with
medical articles, but I'll look to see.
If it turns out it is supported, we have to
look to the other side to see what was refuting it.  And
what on the other side is refuting it, on 327 -- and I
agree with you that this ceiling effect is a big red
herring here -- what actually he said that would go
against it was that he said there is an extrapolation
from his conclusion that 500 milligrams could cause
death, and so if that much is likely to cause death,
it's certainly likely to cause a coma.  And a coma would
prevent the person from -- from pain.
But his evidence for that was zero.  We know
that, in fact, lots of drugs can kill people without
first putting them into a coma.  And so we look to see
what is it he thinks that if this kills you will first
put you into a coma.  And when I looked -- or asked my
clerks and others to look -- we found zero.
Now, that's my question.  What can you point
me to which will show that what I think is the key
refutation of their expert rests upon zero, that's what
I'm asking you.  That's what I've tried to ask,
inarticulately, perhaps, but now it's more articulate,
so --
MR. WYRICK:  Again, and I have to make this
point, whether it creates a coma or not is not the
constitutionally relevant question.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, well --
MR. WYRICK:  But based on how a central
nervous system depressant works, that a central nervous
--
JUSTICE BREYER:  Let me put it differently.
Not the word "coma".  I think what he was driving at,
your expert, was that you were in a state such that you
would feel no pain.  And the reason he thought you were
in that state is because 500 mg will probably kill you.
And if it's going to kill you, it must, of course, at
least first put you in that state.
So I'm asking the same question, but I am
using the words "that state" in substitution for the
word "coma".
MR. WYRICK:  Because of how a central
nervous system depressant works.  It works by
depressing --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not asking you for
even -- I really want to know where in the record does
he provide support for that statement, that the, quote,
that state, end quote, precedes the death caused by this
drug.
MR. WYRICK:  Well, he describes a couple of
things.  First, he describes the action by which the
drug works as a central nervous system depressant.
It -- it -- by causing death --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But --
MR. WYRICK:  -- it works by paralyzing the
brain to such an extent that your respiratory drive is
knocked out.  Your brain --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's the clear
error here.  It starts right there.  Because the reason
Evans thought that it worked -- paralyzed the brain is
because he thought this worked on the spinal cord.  And
nobody argues it works on the spinal cord, number one.
And, number two, this is not a central nervous system
drug.  That's the barbiturates.  This is -- works very
differently than barbiturates.
MR. WYRICK:  This is a central nervous
system depressant, just like a barbiturate.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Depressant, but it's
not a --
MR. WYRICK:  It's not -- it's not a
barbiturate, but makes -- they are both --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.  It has no
pain-relieving qualities.
MR. WYRICK:  No, but they're both central
nervous system depressants.  The barbiturates have no
pain-relieving qualities either.  That's -- that's
undisputed on the record.  So I want --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're right, it --
it -- but it's still -- I don't know where you're
getting -- Justice -- Justice Breyer said, the proof of
that.
MR. WYRICK:  Because it's a conceded fact on
this record that a 500 milligram dose will render them
unconscious within a matter of 60 to 90 seconds.  That
means that the central nervous system depressant is
working to such a state to paralyze their brain and
render them unconscious.  It is a conceded fact that
they will be --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're unconscious, but
that doesn't tell me that you're not feeling pain, or
that a noxious stimulant like being burned alive won't
cause pain.
Look at what happens with the intubations.
They paralyze your throat, they give you this drug, but
they're paralyzing your throat, and that has its own
anesthetic effect and pain relief.
So what you're arguing is very different
from what's happening here.  They're putting a chemical
inside of you that's burning you to death.  That is the
most noxious stimuli I can think of.
MR. WYRICK:  Respectfully, you have that
backwards on intubation.  They give the paralytic -- the
same paralytic that's the second drug here -- first to
keep the patient from -- or they give the midazolam
first to anesthetize them, and then give them the
paralytic to keep them from moving.  The same paralytic
that these Petitioners say cause the unconstitutional
agonizing suffering.  And I'm telling you, rapid
sequence intubation is done routinely, giving patients a
small dose of midazolam, paralyzing them with that
paralytic, causing the same --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, they paralyze them
also with the throat local anesthetic.  I mean, I read
it.
MR. WYRICK:  The rapid sequence intubation
describes midazolam as the first-line choice.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sure, it's a first line
in a lot of things --
MR. WYRICK:  But we also --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it doesn't keep you
in an anesthetic state forever.  It doesn't keep you
during the procedure --
MR. WYRICK:  I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- during surgeries.
MR. WYRICK:  It can.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In some.
MR. WYRICK:  Look at the Saari article cited
by their experts which describes the use of the
anesthetic.
The other thing I want to point out is the
16 professors' brief, because this really is their
ceiling effect in a nutshell, this -- this figure that's
in the brief.  It shows that a benzodiazepine puts you
right to a surgical plane of anesthesia, but not beyond.
Now, first we would say a surgical plane of anesthesia
is sufficient.  But go to that source.  The source that
they cite for that chart, it's the Brenner textbook, and
read what it actually says with respect to this chart.
Here's what it says:  Benzodiazepines
exhibit a ceiling effect which precludes severe CNS
depression after oral administration of these drugs.
Intravenous administration of benzodiazepines can
produce anesthesia.  That's what the text actually says.
That's what the Saari article actually says.
You can produce anesthesia with these drugs.  The fact
that they're not commonly used as general anesthetics is
because we have better choices, not because the drug is
incapable of producing that effect.
Now, remember, here's where their experts
started, here's where they started in the blue brief.
They said that because of the ceiling effect, this drug
is incapable of producing a coma.  We said someone
forgot to tell the FDA, because the warning is right
there in the FDA label about coma.  So they have
retreated now in the reply brief to, well, it can't
reliably produce a coma.
Well, if it can get someone to a coma, where
is the ceiling effect?  Is there some basic
pharmacological principle with this drug that prevents
the drug from ever getting to a coma or not?  We have
established there is not.
We ask you to also look at the cases out of
Florida.  There, for instance, Dr. Markeith, an
anesthesiologist who was the anesthesiologist for inmate
Baze, in Baze v. Rees, testifying for an inmate in
Florida --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If I come out of this
argument, because you presented a lot of things to us
that wasn't before either the district court or the
court of appeals, wouldn't be -- and I believe that your
experts didn't prove their point at all and that they
showed enough.  Why don't we let the district court
below sort out whether it still holds to its opinion
based on a plethora of materials you've given us?
MR. WYRICK:  Two quick responses.
One is they didn't meet their burden under
Brewer v. Landrigan, a showing that is sure or very
likely on the record that they presented.  Second, we
put plenty of rebuttal evidence on, enough to support
the district court's finding.  There's no clear error
here.  And the two-court rule applies, because we have a
court of appeals affirming that district court finding.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Wyrick, to an
extent that's unusual even in this Court, you have been
listening rather than talking.  And so I'm happy to give
you an extra five minutes, if you'd like.
And, of course, we'll give additional time
to you, as well, Ms. Konrad.  And hopefully we'll have a
chance to hear what you have to say.
MR. WYRICK:  I appreciate that.  And I want
to continue my point about ceiling effect and what
evidence they put on.  I -- I told you about the first
source, which was the Material Safety Data Sheet.  It
says nothing about a ceiling effect.  We pointed that
out.  Nothing in the reply brief on that.
Their second was the study about rats, the
Hovinga study.  We pointed out again -- we read that
study.  There's no mention of a ceiling effect.  Again,
no response in the reply brief.  Now, that's the
evidence that they put before the district court on what
they said clearly demonstrates that there's a ceiling
effect.
Now, after the fact, when we were at the
court of appeals, their expert submitted an additional
declaration and cited two more sources.  He cited this
Hall study, which was the dog study, where they took 5
dogs, gave them a big dose of midazolam and clamped
their tails.  And that study concluded, well, we see the
midazolam -- the effect of the drug begins to slow at a
certain point and hypothesized, well, there may be a
ceiling effect, because the drug -- the -- the effects
of the drug are beginning to slow.
But that study concluded, as we pointed out
in the response brief, that if you take the results and
you extrapolate out, once you get to about 30 milligrams
per kilogram for a dog, you would achieve full surgical
anesthesia, full surgical anesthesia.
Now, their other expert, he cited the Saari
article for the proposition that there is a ceiling
effect.  It just cites back to Hall, the dog study, and
says, well, there may be a ceiling effect.  And then it
goes on to say that, in fact, this drug has been used
for general anesthesia as the sole drug, and that its
use was discontinued because propofol came along, and it
was a better choice.
That was their record case for a ceiling
effect.  So when they stand up and say that they clearly
demonstrated that there was, in fact, a ceiling effect,
they're just wrong.
Now, the other study that Dr. Lubarsky cited
in his after-the-fact declaration that was never
submitted to the district court, was the Greenblatt
study.  And he claimed that that study showed that at .3
milligrams per kilogram there was a ceiling effect.  We
went and read the study.  .3 milligrams per kilogram
were -- were never given to the patients in that study.
That study was about what happens if we give .1
milligrams per kilogram of this drug?  At varying
dosages, what happens?  We pointed that in -- that out
in the response brief.  Nothing in the reply.
Their evidence on this ceiling effect is
indefensible because if you go and read the sources,
they just don't say what Dr. Lubarsky said that they
say.
Paradoxical effects have fallen out of the
case.  This lack of analgesia, again, we've pointed out,
is only relevant if someone's not unconscious and
insensate.  They just can't avoid the fact that the
district court here made this factual finding and said
it's a virtual certainty.  If it's a virtual certainty
that they're unconscious and unaware of the pain, they
cannot establish a substantial probability or an
objectively intolerable risk.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Konrad, why don't you take 8 minutes, up
to 8 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBIN C. KONRAD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. KONRAD:  Justice Kagan, I wanted to
address your hypothetical.  And it -- in this case, if
the risk from using midazolam, if Petitioners are
correct, manifests itself, then there will be
unconstitutional pain and suffering.  And my friend
admitted that, that if, in fact, a person is burned
alive and didn't have appropriate anesthesia, that would
be unconstitutional.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess the question I was
asking was if a person was burned alive and we didn't
know whether he had appropriate anesthesia, would that
be unconstitutional, too?
MS. KONRAD:  That would be, Justice Kagan,
and that's -- the point here is that the district court
below found that there is a greater risk in using
midazolam, but found it was unquantifiable.  And so if
that risk, in fact, manifests itself, there will be a
constitutionally intolerable execution.  And this case
is different than Brewer v. Landrigan because in that
case, the drug formula at issue was using sodium
thiopental, which --
JUSTICE ALITO:  If an -- if an
anesthesiologist rendered a person completely
unconscious, and then the person was burned alive, would
that be cruel and unusual punishment?
MS. KONRAD:  Justice Alito, I think the
problem isn't rendering somebody unconscious.  What the
problem is, and what is necessary, is to ensure that the
person maintains a -- a deep level of unconsciousness.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  So an anesthesiologist
is called in to make sure that this person feels no pain
whatsoever while being burned alive, and then the person
is burned alive, would that not be a violation of the
Eighth Amendment anyway?
MS. KONRAD:  It could be.  That's not the
question, though, before this Court, and the -- the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because potassium
chloride --
MS. KONRAD:  An --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- is kind of like that,
isn't it?  It's being burned alive from the inside.
That's what it is.
MS. KONRAD:  That's exactly what it is,
Justice Kagan, but what --
JUSTICE ALITO:  But you're not sure that
being burned alive -- that you think there are
circumstances in which burning somebody at the stake
would be consistent with the Eighth Amendment?
MS. KONRAD:  It is --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It's an irrelevant point,
but you're -- you're not certain about that?
MS. KONRAD:  Well, what I'm saying is that
this Court has -- the founders say burning at the stake
is unconstitutional.  It creates an Eighth Amendment
violation.  It's cruel and unusual.  But in your
hypothetical, if there was a way to ensure that that was
done in a humane way, there could perhaps be.  That -- I
don't think that any -- any State would go to try to do
that, because we move forward evolving --
JUSTICE ALITO:  That's an incredible answer.
You think that there are circumstances in which burning
alive would not be a violation of the Eighth Amendment?
Burning somebody alive would not be a violation of the
Eighth Amendment?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You see, but potassium
chloride is burning somebody alive.  It's just doing it
through the use in a -- of a drug.
MS. KONRAD:  Which is what we have here and
here the district court found a risk, a risk that it
could not quantify.  And that risk violates the Eighth
Amendment.  Again, what this Court needs to understand
is that the barbiturates function differently.
In Baze and in Landrigan, the -- there was a
use of a barbiturate that was known to produce a deep
coma-like unconsciousness.  And the reason why that's
important, it doesn't matter that barbiturates also
don't have analgesic properties because we know --
science and medicine tells us that those drugs will
reliably induce a deep coma-like unconsciousness.
Midazolam cannot do this.
And the -- my friend has -- has said that
there is no support for the ceiling effect.  And we
would disagree.  And -- and our expert cited studies.
The study on the rats that was cited in -- as Exhibit 2,
shows the sigmoidal Emax curve, which he explained in
his testimony.  The State's expert had no explanation,
had no support for the testimony that he presented.
When he testified, he did not have data to
cite.  He was incorrect.  He made a mathematical error.
And, again, what this Court needs to understand is that
giving the drug, even if it could potentially cause a
toxic effect, that will not protect against the
unconstitutional pain and suffering from the second and
third drugs.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
