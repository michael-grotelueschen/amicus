CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument this morning in Case 14-378, McFadden v.
United States.
Mr. Russell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUSSELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The briefing in this Court has narrowed
considerably the disagreement among the parties.  We now
all agree that the Fourth Circuit misconstrued the mens
rea element for a -- a criminal offense under the
Controlled Substance Analogue Act, and we further agree
that the jury instructions actually given in this case
were erroneous.
Instead, we and the government now agree
that to prove an offense, the government must show that
the defendant knowingly distributed an analogue.  And we
further agree that the government may do that by showing
that the defendant knew that the substance in question
had the characteristics that made it an analogue under
the statute.
Where we may disagree is over the
government's alternative theory that it can instead show
that the defendant knew that the substance was illegal
or regulated.  If all the government means by that is
illegal or regulated under the statute of conviction,
the Controlled Substances Act itself, we would agree,
but the government would simply lose because, as it's
acknowledged, the evidence in this case tended to show
that my client did not believe that his conduct violated
the CSA itself.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But just to make sure I
understand all that you're agreeing on, you do agree
that if the defendant knew that the substance was
illegal under the Controlled Substances Act or the
Analogue Act, even though the defendant didn't know the
chemical structure or the particular effects -- say that
the dealer had handed him a box and said this is our new
analogue which is illegal under this -- under the
Analogue Act, you -- you agree that that is sufficient
for a conviction.
MR. RUSSELL:  We do agree with that.  And I
think that that is simply a special application of the
general rule that the defendant has to know the facts
that make his conduct unlawful because he knows in that
circumstance the only fact he needs to know in order to
know that what he's doing is illegal.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that -- that sounds
sensible to me.  What about the expert testimony from
chemists?  Is that still put on in the trial?  Does the
government still have to show -- put on an expert to
say, well, this is chemically modified, but it's
substantially similar and the jury sits there knowing
that it doesn't have to listen to this?  I mean, how
does that work?
MR. RUSSELL:  No.  They do have to show that
because the government still has to prove that it is, in
fact, an analogue.  So they have to both show that the
defendant --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but does a jury have
to understand the chemical testimony?
MR. RUSSELL:  They've -- they've got to make
the determination that it is, in fact, chemically
substantially similar.  I acknowledge that that's a lot
to ask of a jury.  It's a lot to ask of a -- of a
defendant to understand that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it is the
government's burden to show both the composition in
relation to the controlled substance, and the -- the
effect of the drug.  Those -- those the government must
prove.  But what we have out of the way is that the
defendant now doesn't have to know -- you agree the
defendant doesn't have to understand the chemical
structure?
MR. RUSSELL:  He doesn't have to understand
the chemical structure if the government can prove that
the defendant knew that the substance was illegal under
the Controlled Substances Act itself.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the government
has given up a lot getting to this point and I think
you've just given up a lot.
I would have thought your -- your position
that you have to know that it's regulated under the
chemical substances or Controlled Substances Act, it
seems to me is -- is contrary to the proposition that
ignorance of the law is no excuse.  If you didn't
know -- I didn't know this was regulated, you would say
he's -- he's innocent because he didn't know the law.
I thought your position was that you do have
to know, as in all the other cases in the mens rea area,
the -- the facts that make your conduct illegal.  You
don't have to know that it's illegal.
MR. RUSSELL:  That -- that is certainly our
principal position.  We are willing to say, however,
that either -- whether you consider it a special
exception to that rule or a special application to that
rule, if the government can show that the defendant
knows that the substance is illegal under the statute of
conviction, that serves the basic purpose of the
knowledge of fact requirement, which is something --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And if he doesn't
know, he's innocent.
MR. RUSSELL:  If he does not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If he's ignorant of
that law, he's not guilty.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, he's not guilty unless
the government can show that he knows that the substance
has the characteristics of -- of an analogue, in which
case his ignorance of the law is not an excuse.
So the government has two options:  It can
prove the facts, the factual knowledge in the way that
this Court described in Staples and has applied in other
cases involving prohibited items.  But we're willing to
acknowledge that if they can, instead of that, show that
he knew that this is illegal under the statute, that's
good enough because --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and I take it that's
the same as under the Controlled Substances Act itself;
is that right?  That's the analogy, is that you can
either show the person knew it was heroin or you can
show, well, the person didn't know it was heroin, but
the person did know that it was some drug that was on
Schedule I of the -- of -- of -- and so a controlled
substance.
MR. RUSSELL:  That's right.  And where we
disagree with the government is that it construes some
of the lower court cases that say that as saying the
broader thing, which is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  You keep
saying "knowing that it's illegal under the Act."  He
doesn't have to know the Act.  He just has to know it's
illegal, that some law regulates it; otherwise, he's not
going to know what the number of the law is or the
Controlled Substance Act.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, let me be clear.  When I
say --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, criminals don't
care.  They just know that this is -- they may think
it's something.  They just know it's a controlled
substance.
MR. RUSSELL:  No.  I -- I would disagree
with that.  And I think that's the principal
disagreement we have with the government here, is that
it's not enough to show that the defendant thinks that
it's illegal generally or that it's unlawful under an
import statute or State law.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.  The -- the
government would say if he's selling it without paying
the sales tax, he knows that that's illegal, that's
enough to convict him under the Controlled Substances
Act.
MR. RUSSELL:  Potentially, I -- I think
that that may be their argument, you know.  So we give
the example in our brief of somebody who knows he's
selling Cuban cigars in violation of the import ban.  He
knows in that case that it's an illegal or controlled
substance, but that knowledge doesn't equate -- you
wouldn't say that somebody in that case knows he's
selling a controlled substance, simply because it turns
out, unbeknownst to him, that the cigars have marijuana
in them.
That's not the way that you use the English
language.  You wouldn't say that he knowingly sold
marijuana or even that he knowingly controlled a -- sold
a controlled substance.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Let's take the -- a
case involving a drug that isn't an analogue, a drug
that's actually listed.  And let's say that the facts
are these:  The distributor gives it to the person who's
going to make the distribution and says this is an
illegal drug, go distribute it.  And the person then
goes and distributes it and tries to evade law
enforcement and so forth, is caught.
Now, is it -- is that sufficient -- is that
evidence sufficient to take the case to the jury so the
jury can find -- the jury can decide whether there's
circumstantial evidence that the person who distributed
the drugs knew that it was a controlled substance under
Federal law as opposed to one of the few things that is
illegal under State law, but not under Federal law?
MR. RUSSELL:  Yes, I think that's sufficient
evidence to go to the jury.  The jury then has to decide
whether to make that inference.  And in a case like this
where the defendant puts on countervailing evidence that
he, in fact, didn't believe it violated Federal law, or
when -- or if the defendant is able to explain, yeah, I
thought it was illegal because I thought it was in
violation of an import statute, then it's up to jury to
decide whether to believe that.  But if it does, then it
ought to conclude that mens rea wasn't established
unless the government can show that the defendant knew
the characteristics of the substance that made it an
analogue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the supplier
tells the dealer this substance produces exactly the
same effect as cocaine.  Would that be enough to satisfy
the mens rea requirement?
MR. RUSSELL:  It wouldn't be enough to
satisfy it.  It would may be evidence from which the jury
could draw an inference that the defendant knew that it
was a controlled substance under Federal law.  I don't
think that they -- they should.  I think it's -- it's
only partial evidence.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you say he has to
know the -- the chemical makeup that causes it to be an
analogue.  Right?
MR. RUSSELL:  He either has to know that or
he has to know that it violates the CSA.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand.  Let's assume
that he doesn't know that it violates the law.  He also
doesn't know that it -- what the chemical makeup is.
But he knows what it is.  It is MVD-3.  That's all he
knows.
Now, under the Controlled Substances Act,
that would be enough.  He wouldn't have to know the
makeup of it.  He would just have to know it's one of
the named controlled substances.  If indeed MD-3 is --
is an analogue, why isn't that enough that he just knows
what it was and what it was is an analogue?
MR. RUSSELL:  Right.  I think that's
parallel to somebody knowing that he has an AR-15 rifle,
which is, in fact, a machine gun.  In Staples, this
Court said that's not enough.  You need to know the
facts about the gun that make it an analogue, which
isn't its name -- or which make it a machine gun, which
isn't its name.  Here it's not the name --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, this isn't a rifle.
This is, in fact, an analogue of a controlled substance.
I mean, it's -- it's not a proper comparison.
MR. RUSSELL:  With respect --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He knows that it is -- he
knows the identity of it.  And -- and that chemical
is -- has, in fact, the characteristics that make it an
analogue.
MR. RUSSELL:  He knows -- knowing simply the
name of it doesn't tell you whether it's an analogue or
not.  You don't know that it's an analogue simply
because you know the name.  And the way that you
would --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's true.  And -- and
knowing that it's cocaine doesn't prove that you know
it's a controlled substance.
MR. RUSSELL:  It -- it does though, because
the only fact that you need to know about cocaine for it
to be a controlled substance is that it is cocaine.
Because that's the fact that makes it illegal.  It's
listed on the Controlled Substance Act and the
controlled substance schedules.  So if it's cocaine, you
know everything you need to know, based on the
presumption that you know the law, to know that what
you're doing is illegal, and that's not true --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose -- suppose the
distributor gives it to the person who's going to
distribute it and says, here, distribute this and
there's the actual chemical formula on the container and
it's the chemical formula, excuse me, for PCP, whatever
that is, C-something H-something and -- so that's all a
person knows.  He knows exactly what it is, the chemical
formula.  Is that -- has he not committed a -- a crime
then?
MR. RUSSELL:  Under the ordinary
Controlled --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.
MR. RUSSELL:  -- Substances Act?
I don't know.  I mean, it depends, I think,
on how it's listed in the schedule.  I think the
schedule might, in fact, list the chemical name, but
if --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It does list the chemical
name.
MR. RUSSELL:  So then I think you do know
the fact that that makes the conduct unlawful.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But you don't know -- the
person has just arrived, excuse me, from -- from Mars
and has no idea what -- you know, whether -- whether
it's legal or not.
MR. RUSSELL:  I think the basic assumption
is that people know what the law is.  They know what's
in the -- the schedules.  And if you know what's in the
schedule and if you know the fact, that's enough, I
think, to convict.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What -- what do you do
with the actual facts of this case?  That is, the
defendant gave names to what he was peddling.  He called
it speed, Nu-Up, a replacement for the listed -- now
listed MPPD.  He -- these were supposed to be bath
salts, but there's no bath salts in the world that cost
what those packets cost.
So what -- what do we make of what he was
advertising this to be, Speed-Up, and selling it at a
price that fits a controlled substance?
MR. RUSSELL:  I think what it reflects --
what a jury certainly could find it to reflect, and I
think what the truth of the matter is, is that it shows
that Petitioner thought he'd found a loophole to the
Federal drug laws; that so long as something was not
on the schedules, even if it had drug-like
effects, he could sell it and he could sell it at
whatever price the market would bear.
You know, certainly, the government can
point to that kind of evidence to suggest that he knew
that his conduct violated the Controlled Substances Act.
But here, of course --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I thought you said that
that kind of evidence was enough to get you to a jury,
right?
MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  That the defendant acted
furtively or that he sold these for incredibly inflated
prices, that all of that, it's not -- it's not the thing
itself, but it's evidence of the thing that the
government is trying to prove.
MR. RUSSELL:  That's right.  And I think it
gets to the jury, but it doesn't prove what the
government has to prove here, which is harmless error
beyond a reasonable doubt.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But then if I can just
understand.  I mean, I think -- tell me if I'm wrong --
that the only thing that's possibly separating you and
the government -- we'll see if it is separating you and
the government -- is this question of what happens if
the defendant knew it was illegal under something other
than the CSA or the Analogue Act, right?  And that's the
only point of potential difference between you and the
government?
MR. RUSSELL:  I think that's true with
respect to our legal interpretation.  I will say we also
think that you ought not to reach that because this
entire regulated status theory was raised for the first
time in the government's brief on the merits in this
Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait -- wait a minute.  I
mean, yes, you do differ with the government on that.
MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but assuming that --
that the government cannot prove any belief in
illegality, the government would not say it therefore
must prove that you knew the chemical composition of
what you were selling.  And you say, you have to know
the chemical composition.
MR. RUSSELL:  Right.  I -- I think we're all
on the same page.  So just to be clear about our
position, I think that the only disagreement about the
meaning of the law between the government and us now is
this question of whether it's sufficient as a matter of
law for the government to show that the defendant
believed that the substance was unlawful under some law
other than the CSA.  They think that's sufficient; we
think it's not sufficient.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So --
MR. RUSSELL:  Beyond that though --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And this is for --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Assuming it's not
sufficient, what -- what else does the government have
to prove?  I think you differ on that.
MR. RUSSELL:  I don't think so.  I think the
government agrees that one way to prove the mens rea in
this case is to show that the defendant knew the
characteristics of the substance that made it an
analogue.  They agree that they can do it that way.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which means the chemical
composition?
MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.  Yes.  I understand that
to be --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  We'll see.
MR. RUSSELL:  -- their position.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And who would that reach
other than the -- the chemist?  The underground chemist
would be in a position to know that, but an ordinary
person would not.
MR. RUSSELL:  I -- I acknowledge that giving
the statute what I think is a pretty straightforward
and -- and traditional reading does have the effect of
making it substantially harder for the government to
prove that mens rea for an ordinary layperson, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, my -- my under --
well, the government will tell you, but my understanding
of the government is it would be enough if the defendant
knew the name -- the name of the drug, that it's blue
fly --
MR. RUSSELL:  Now, if --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- or whatever else.  And
if, indeed, that drug has the chemical composition.
MR. RUSSELL:  I won't spend the Court's time
looking it up.  I'm pretty confident that's not their
position.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
MR. RUSSELL:  That they've said the opposite.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the court
instructs the jury that it's -- it suffices if the
defendant knows that this is an illegal drug because of
its hallucinogenic effect.
MR. RUSSELL:  I don't think -- it -- again,
the critical question is illegal drug.  If it -- by that
you mean illegal drug under the CSA.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  It's an illegal drug
because of its hallucinogenic effect.  Maybe that's
incorrect because it has to be chemically the same, so
that's incomplete.  But it seems to me that should
suffice for mens rea.
MR. RUSSELL:  Just to be clear.  I think a
court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And, excuse me, and
then -- and then it's -- it's shown that this is
chemically similar.
MR. RUSSELL:  Right.  I think the Court
would have to tell the jury that you can take into
account the defendant's knowledge of its hallucinogenic
effect in deciding whether he knew it was illegal under
the Controlled Substances Act itself.
And so what I'm quibbling with is just the
unadorned word "illegal."  I don't think it would be
sufficient if a jury was convinced that the defendant
thought it's a hallucinogenic effect and it's illegal
under State law.  That's why I was acting furtively.
I don't think that a jury could, if it
believed that, find the mens rea established unless, of
course, it went under this factual knowledge prong.
That's -- that's the ordinary way in which knowledge of
unlawful possession of a prohibited item is proven.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the instructions at
page 14 of your brief -- the brief in footnote 9 -- can
you say that by adding just a sentence or two to the
first paragraph?
MR. RUSSELL:  No.  Because --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or -- or is it beyond hope
or what?
MR. RUSSELL:  No.  I -- I think -- recall
that this is setting forth the elements.  And so I think
the element is that the defendant has to know that he's
distributing an analogue.  And then there's questions
about ways in which to prove that.  And I think the
jury -- the -- the court could give an instruction of
the sort that we proposed, which said that the defendant
has to know that -- that this is an analogue within the
meaning.  It has the characteristics that make it an
analogue within the meaning of the statute.
Had the government asked for an instruction,
it could have also given instructions that -- or the
government can show that the defendant knew the conduct
was unlawful generally.  And you can make that -- or
unlawful under the CSA itself.  And you can reach that
conclusion based on circumstantial evidence, including
evidence concerning the defendant's knowledge about the
drug's effect.
But there's a world of difference between
saying that this is relevant circumstantial evidence
about whether the defendant knew that he was violating
the statute of conviction and what the government's
position is, which is once you prove that the defendant
knows that it's illegal at all, you're done.  And the
jury is compelled to conclude that mens rea is
established.  And I think that that's simply wrong.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry to put you
through this again, but it's important, I think for me
anyway, to get it right.  I understand your -- your
understanding that the SG -- it's a big difference.  The
SG says you have to know it's illegal under any law.
You say, no, under the CSA.
Now, what was the other way in which you
disagree with the government?
MR. RUSSELL:  I think that's the only way in
which we disagree about the meaning of the statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  But I thought
that you were disagreeing about names and
characteristics.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I was disagreeing with
Justice Scalia.  I don't think we're actually
disagreeing with the government about that because I
think they have said in their brief under the knowledge
of identity approach, they have to show that the
defendant knows the chemical structure and effects of
the analogue because it's not enough to simply know its
name.  And so I don't think that we disagree with each
other on that.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask, Mr. Russell,
about your difference as to whether it's under this
statute or under any statute?
If you look at some of the instructions that
are given just under the CSA, not analogues, that some
of the instructions just say that you need to find that
the defendant knew that he was distributing some kind of
prohibited drug.  And they don't say a drug prohibited
under the CSA.  So if we use that as the analogy here,
that would suggest that -- that the -- the jury wouldn't
need to find the -- the analogue prohibited under the
CSA and the Analogue Act, but just that they knew it was
prohibited by something.
MR. RUSSELL:  Right.  I think there is an
ambiguity in those instructions, whether it's referring
to unlawfulness generally, or unlawfulness under the
CSA.  I think courts -- what they really mean is under
the CSA.  And in the cases where the defendant has come
forward and said, actually, I thought it was illegal
under some other statute, in Hassan and again in
Hussein, and -- and, I believe, the case of Morales.
Three of the seven cases the government cites for this
proposition, the Court has said, no, that's not good
enough.  And those are -- and that makes complete sense.
Now, it -- it could be that in a lot of
cases the government is going to present evidence that
the defendant just thinks it's -- it's a controlled
substance generally.  And we agree that a jury can
infer, absent other evidence, that he thought it was
illegal under the CSA itself.  But you have to leave
open the possibility that the jury can, in a case like
this, say, actually, no, he -- the evidence doesn't show
that he believed it was lawful -- unlawful under the CSA
because he looked at the schedules, and he quite
reasonably believed that if they weren't on the
schedules, they weren't illegal.
I mean, I will acknowledge, the only reason
that they are illegal if they're not on the schedule is
the existence of the Analogue Act.  And I'll acknowledge
that prior to this case, I didn't know about the
Analogue Act, and I think a lot of people didn't.
And in the community where -- where my
client was selling these things, these things were being
sold openly in delis and gas stations that were being
advertised in local newspapers and magazines.  And
that's, I think, consistent with the -- the fact that
lots of people entertain the incorrect notion that if
something's not on -- on the schedules, then it's legal
to sell.  And somebody who is ignorant to that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, and you don't defend
that, right?  I mean, ignorance of the law is no excuse.
MR. RUSSEL:  It's no excuse.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You would agree that, even
though you're totally ignorant that it's on the Analogue
Act, if you know the chemical composition and it happens
to be on the analogue -- covered by the Analogue Act,
they got you; right?
MR. RUSSELL:  No.  I -- let me try to make
clear my position.
We agree that if the government can prove
that you had the factual knowledge that the chemical has
the characteristics that make it -- it an analogue,
ignorance of the law is no excuse.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait.  Wait.  Wait.
Wait.
MR. RUSSELL:  We do not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what does that
mean?
MR. RUSSELL:  So --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I know all of the chemical
characteristics.  Okay?  I have to, in addition, know
that those characteristics make it an analogue?
MR. RUSSELL:  No.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
MR. RUSSELL:  So there -- there are three
options.
The one is that you proposed, they know the
name of the -- of the substance.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  You -- you reject
that.
MR. RUSSELL:  We don't think -- we don't
think that's enough.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. RUSSELL:  If they know that the -- the
substance is chemically substantially similar to a
controlled substance, then they know the fact that makes
its possession unlawful under that realm.  They have to
know, as well, that it's substantially similar and
represented actual fact.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, suppose -- I mean,
I'm not a chemist.  I don't know that it's substantially
similar, but I do know what the chemical composition is.
I have to, in addition, know that that chemical
composition is substantially similar?
MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think so.  I think
if I know the chemical composition and, in fact, that is
substantially similar --
MR. RUSSELL:  Well.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- they got you.
MR. RUSSELL:  I think -- I think we disagree
about that.  But if you take that view, we still win
this case because there's no evidence that Petitioner
knew anything about the chemical structure of -- of what
he was selling here.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I assume your argument is
simply that it's a kind of coincidence.  You have to
know that this substance is an analogue, and there are
two ways you could know that.  One way you could know it
is you could know what the chemical composition of this
is and what the chemical composition of, say, cocaine
is.  That would be one way.  Very few people other than
chemists know that.
Then there is a second way you could know.
The second way you could know is that you know that it
is forbidden by a law which has the title forbidding
analogues.  And if you happen to know that it falls
within that, of course you know it's an analogue because
you know it falls within it.  And those are the two
ways.
MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And no one's been able to
think of a third.
And ignorance of the law is no excuse has
nothing to do with this case.  This is just a
coincidence that those are the two ways you could know
it was an analogue.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I certainly agree that
those are the two ways that you can know that it is an
analogue.  And I don't think that -- that the government
can even argue that it satisfied that burden in this
case, much less that the jury would have been compelled
to find that harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but you say that the
government has to prove knowledge of two chemical
compositions:  The chemical composition of what is being
sold, but also, the chemical composition of one of the
items on the -- on the list of controlled substances.
MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.  Yes.  That is -- that is
our position.  And that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But only if that's the
government's theory.  Only if the government goes that
route rather than the route of just saying you knew it
was an analogue.
MR. RUSSELL:  That is correct.  And, you
know, I will acknowledge that going the knowledge of
identity route in an analogue case is going to be
different -- difficult for nonchemists.
But I think it's difficult for reasons that
should not give the Court pause, which is simply that
it's difficult for somebody to know, even if they know
what the law is, whether what they're doing is illegal
or not.  And so, you know, our theory has the benefit of
avoiding entirely the vagueness problems that we think
are inherent in this statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Was there enough evidence
in this case to go to the jury under the instruction
that you want?
MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.  I will agree that there
was.
And so the only question here is whether
there should be a new trial under which we can have
another discussion with the -- with the district court
about what the proper instructions are -- I don't think
we will have a lot of disagreement about that -- or
whether the court should instead hold that the error is
harmless.
And it would be exceedingly unfair to do
that in this case on the ground that Petitioner didn't
prevent -- present sufficient evidence to rebut a theory
the government wasn't making at trial.  That's why we
have and why we enforce forfeiture rules.
And this Court could, I think, quite easily
resolve this case by saying, as Justice Breyer did, here
is the legal rule, here are the two ways in which this
can be proven, but the government in this case, to the
extent it has some special new theory about illegal
under some other law has waived that argument by failing
to preserve it.
If I could reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Harrington.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. HARRINGTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
My friend, Mr. Russell, is almost correct
about the extent of the disagreement that's left in this
case.  Our position is not that we can prevail if we can
prove that the defendant believed that his conduct was
illegal under some law other than the CSA or the
Analogue Act.  Our position is that we can prevail if we
can prove that a defendant knowingly distributed a drug
and that he believed that his conduct, that his
distribution of the drug was illegal, generally.
As Justice Sotomayor has --
JUSTICE BREYER:  My question is -- that I
posed to him is really for you.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Would you mind repeating
it?
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I'll try.
Suppose you have to show, and I think you
do, that the defendant did know it is an analogue, say
to cocaine.  There are two ways you could do that.  The
first way is you could show that this defendant, being a
graduate in chemistry, knows what the chemical
composition of cocaine is, knows what the chemical
composition of this other substance is, and knows they
are the same.  You're not going to be able to do that
very often.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Another possibility is you
could show that he knows that this particular substance
is banned by a law that is called the -- the Analogue
Act, because obviously if he knows that it is banned by
the Act that bans analogues, it must be an analogue.
Those are two ways you could prove knowledge.
To prove that it is banned by the
Anti-Turkey Shoot Act proves nothing about his knowledge
that this is an analogue.  And, therefore, once you say,
as you are trying to say, I think, that some other
illegality is enough to convict, I no longer understand
the argument.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, the argument, as
Justice Sotomayor pointed out, in the real world,
defendants don't tend to know specific provisions of
Federal law or State law, but they do tend to know
whether what they're doing is illegal or not.  And so
our view is that the knowing or intentional standard in
Section 841(a) describes a culpable state of mind.  And
one way to prove that culpable state of mind is to prove
that the defendant knowingly or intentionally engaged in
the act --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but then you're not --
then you are saying the defendant does not have to know
it is an analogue, and that, I think, you don't want to
say.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, what we're saying --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Because you could think it
was banned by some other act, and that would make you
know that it is that thing that the other act bans.  It
doesn't tend to show it's an analogue.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.  Well, what I'm
saying is defendants tend to believe that what they're
doing is illegal, not under any particular provision,
but just generally they believe it's illegal.  And we --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not what the statute
says.  The statute doesn't say knowingly be a bad guy.
It says knowingly manufacture, distribute, or dispense a
controlled substance.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes, and it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what the knowingly
applies to.  So you have to know that it violates that
law, not just know that you're -- you're a bad guy.
That doesn't -- that's not what it says.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, in almost every
context, the easiest way to prove knowledge of -- of
this kind of statute is to prove that the defendant knew
the facts that made his conduct illegal.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MS. HARRINGTON:  But what the knowing --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Under the statute.
MS. HARRINGTON:  But just to prove the
facts.  He doesn't have to have any awareness of the
statute, but if he knows all the facts, which in this
case would include knowledge of the chemical structure
and pharmacological effects, that's usually, in other
contexts, the easiest way to prove knowledge under this
kind of statute.
In this context, that's not the easiest way,
and we think there is another way.  We think the knowing
or intentional standard describe the culpable mental
state, and this Court has said that that's -- that to
prove knowledge, you don't always have to prove that the
defendant knew all the -- the critical facts.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you answer the --
the Cuban cigar that turns out to be filled with
marijuana?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I guess our primary
submission is that it's sufficient if the government
proves that a defendant distributed a drug and that he
believed that doing so was illegal under some drug law;
that he knew it was some kind of illegal drug.  We think
it would be --
JUSTICE SCALIA:
some drug law.
MS. HARRINGTON:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
Well, it has to be under
Well, we think --
You didn't say this before,
and I don't think your brief said it.  It has to be
illegal under some other drug law.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, just -- let me just
point out the reason there's maybe not as much
explication in the briefs is because there's a
fundamental disagreement that became clear in the reply
brief that -- that we disagree with Petitioner about
what the courts of appeals have done in the CSA context.
And I can get to that in a second.
But we think certainly it's sufficient if a
defendant believes that what he's doing is illegal under
a drug law, that he's distributing an illegal drug.  We
think it would be consistent with sort of broader
principles if the Court held more broadly than that,
that he believed that his conduct was illegal generally.
You don't need to go that far in this case.  The breadth
of that hasn't fully been briefed in this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the problem -- I
mean, that highlights what I think is the practical
difference here.  You've got a defendant who is
obviously -- knows something's out there.  He's trying
not to do something, whether it's not to violate the CSA
or whether it's not to violate anything.  And you just
want to be able to show to the jury, look, something is
bothering him.  He knows that something's afoot, and --
and that's all you want to be -- have to prove, as
opposed to he knows he's violating either the CSA or a
drug law.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, we --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And I just don't
know how that works.  I understand how that works in
this case, because you just say to the jury, look,
he's -- he's checking the schedule every day, he's doing
this, he's doing that.  But I'm a little concerned about
extending that as a general matter, where it doesn't
have to be the law in -- one, because I think usually
it's not a question whether you know anything about the
law at all, it's simply whether you know a question
about the facts, and whether that happens to bring it
under the law.
But then I don't know how broad the
principle is that you just have to know what you're
doing is -- would raise a doubt in the jury's mind about
whether you knew it was legal or not.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, so I -- I have two
types of responses, which I'll just point out so that I
can come back to them in case I don't get through them
all.  The first is a doctrinal point.  And second, I can
give you sort of a real world example of how this works
in the CSA context.
The doctrinal point is that this Court has
held that there are other ways to prove knowledge other
than that a defendant actually knew a critical fact.
For example, the government can prove willful blindness.
And the Court has explained, as recently as the
Global-Tech case, that the reason you allow willful
blindness to substitute for knowledge is not because
being willfully blind to a fact is the same as knowing
the fact.  It's because a person who is willfully blind
to a fact has the same culpable state of mind as the
person who knows the fact.
And so we would submit that a person who
engages in an act intentionally and correctly believes
that doing that is illegal is at least as culpable, if
not more culpable, than the person who knows all the
facts that make his conduct illegal.
And so the real world --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He thought he was violating
a sales tax law, and you're going to send him up the
river for 15 years.
that --
culpable?
MS. HARRINGTON:
JUSTICE SCALIA:
MS. HARRINGTON:
Well, again, we believe
You think he's just as
We don't think the Court
needs to hold that in this case.  We think certainly
it's sufficient if the government can prove that a
defendant knowingly distributed a drug believing it to
be illegal to do so, whether or not he knew what
provision of law --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's illegal because, in
fact, it's bad for animals, and the law involved --
prevents veterinarians from using this kind of drug for
animal treatment.  That's all he knows.  That's all he
thinks.
Now, he's guilty of this statute?  That
doesn't tend to show at all that knowledge that he knows
it's an analogue.  But in your view, because he feels
guilty, as perhaps he should, he's guilty of violating
this law.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, we do believe that
that would establish the necessary culpable state of
mind.  But again, the Court doesn't really need --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why?  Can you give me
any authority for that?  I mean, your example of willful
blindness is an example of where, in fact, in respect to
this law, he knows there is a risk he is violating doing
the conduct that it -- that it permits, he knows there
is a serious risk, and he pays no attention to that at
all.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, we do think it's
fine --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's not a very strong
analogy, I don't think.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, but I think what it
shows is that you don't have to prove actual knowledge
of a fact to satisfy a knowledge standard in a statute.
And again, we think it would be perfectly sufficient for
the Court to hold in this case that when the government
proved the defendant is distributing an illicit drug for
human consumption and he believes that what he's doing
is illegal, and he is correct about that, then that is
enough to -- to satisfy the CSA or the Analogue Act.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it might be except
that there is some evidence in this case different than
what you're saying.  He checked, according to his
brother, the Controlled Substance Act; didn't see this
listed.  And also when he was told something was
illegal, he flushed it down the toilet.
So why isn't -- why don't we leave this to
the court below to figure out whether the error was
harmless or not, given the evidence in the case?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I certainly acknowledge
that that is the Court's usual practice, to remand for
application of a harmless error standard, and we
wouldn't have any problem with the Court doing that
here.
We do think the evidence that you point
tends to show that he may not have believed he was
violating the CSA specifically, but he -- there is
plenty of evidence to show that he knew and correctly
believed that what he was doing was illegal.  He sold
his products in little baggies and vials --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  He has to
know that it's a controlled substance?
MS. HARRINGTON:  He has to know that it's a
controlled substance analogue.  Where we differ is how
you prove that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not even an analogue,
because plenty of people sell things thinking it's maybe
cocaine, but in fact, it's crack, or they sell something
else thinking that it's a different drug, they just know
it's a drug.
MS. HARRINGTON:  We totally -- we are
100 percent on the same page as you.  I think Petitioner
believes --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah, but you keep
saying has to know it's an analogue.  I think that's
wrong.  He just has to know it's a controlled substance.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.  But I mean -- but
by controlled substance, what we don't mean -- this is
where we differ with Petitioner -- we don't mean that he
has to know that it's illegal under Control Substances
Act.  That's Petitioner's position.  That's not our
position.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is this a real world
problem?  This sounds to me like the most artificial
distinction that I've heard in a long time.  Is there --
does Virginia have an Analogue Act?  This is from
Virginia, right?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Does have Virginia have an
Analogue Act that's different from the Federal Analogue
Act?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I do not know that -- the
answer to that question.  Let --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do the States typically have
Analogue Acts, period, or do they have Analogue Acts
that are different from the State Analogue Acts?  You
know, all of these cases -- unless this case involves a
chemist, your proof that a person knew the thing was an
analogue is going to be that this person engaged in all
kinds of furtive conduct to try to hide it from -- from
law enforcement.
And so it's going to be for the -- for the
jury to -- to determine, based on circumstantial
evidence, whether the person knew that this thing was
illegal under some law.  And if it's not the Federal
Controlled Substances Act, I don't know what act it's
going to be.  The defense is going to be, well, you
know, I knew that it was illegal, but I thought it was
illegal under the State Analogue Act, it wasn't illegal
under the Federal Controlled Substances Act.  Is that
what we're worrying about here?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I think that sort of gets
to the point, I mean, the way you sort of characterize
what might be the right instruction, that you have to
prove that the defendant knew it was -- or believed it
was illegal under some drug law, we're fine with that.
I think Petitioner would like the instruction to be that
you have to -- the government has to prove that the
defendant knew it was illegal under the Controlled
Substances Act or under the Analogue Act.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, and the question I'm
asking, a practical question is, we've got the Federal
Controlled Substances Act, the Analogue provision.  What
is this other -- what is this other body of law that
might come into play here?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I'm not sure there is
one, but I think our point is that the defendant -- most
defendants don't -- aren't aware of any body of law,
right?  They just know that what they're doing is
illegal, and so we shouldn't have to prove that he had a
specific -- a specific statute of conviction in his
mind --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Harrington, I mean, I
take your points that this is going to have a very small
practical effect in terms of what either the prosecutor
or the defense attorney is -- is putting on at trial.
But it actually seems to me to be a real theoretical
difference, which has implications far beyond this case.
Then what Mr. Russell has suggested is two
ways of showing that a defendant knew a fact.  That the
fact that he was distributing an analogue, and you might
know it because you know the chemical structure and all
its properties, or you might know it because you know --
you know, somebody has given you a box and said, this is
an analogue prohibited under the Analogue Act, and so
you know that it's an analogue.
So those are two ways of knowing a fact.
But you're saying that in addition to knowing a fact,
the mens rea is satisfied if you can just show that the
defendant knew he was acting culpably in violation of
some law.  And that, it seems to me, is a theory that
could be put on to any law.  That in addition to knowing
all the facts that a statute says you have to know, the
government has an alternative way of proving its case,
which is just to say, oh, look at -- look, you were
acting culpably.  You knew you were doing something
wrong.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes, and again, you know,
we would embrace a narrower articulation in this case of
what your knowledge of illegality has to be.  If you
know you're violating a U.S. drug law or you know you
are distributing an illegal drug, we think that's
sufficient --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose he thought that
there was a labeling law and he was violating the
labeling law.  He's wrong, there is no labeling law,
but it violates the Analogue Act.  Guilty?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Under our view, that would
be sufficient.  We don't think the Court needs to reach
that in this case because there's no suggestion that
he -- that his belief in illegality was that he was
doing anything other than distributing an illicit drug,
that he was violating some U.S. drug law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you -- so you -- just
to clarify, you -- you are saying it's not just any
illegality, it has to be an -- a drug law that's --
that's a qualification.
MS. HARRINGTON:  We're saying at least for
the purposes of this case, that is sufficient.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you mean by "for
purposes of this case"?  What is the law generally?
Must it be a drug law or could it be any law?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, we think it's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why don't you give it up,
Ms. Harrington?  I mean --
MS. HARRINGTON:  Let me just try one more
time.
(Laughter.)
MS. HARRINGTON:  We think it would be
sufficient -- it would be consistent with the way this
Court has treated other mens rea issues such as, you
know, willful standard.
JUSTICE BREYER:  We've got the willful.  I
don't think the problem is with your articulation.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, let me --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I think the problem is
we're sitting here thinking of examples like, you know,
there's an anti-bird hunting statute, and it says you
cannot hunt green-eyed turkey's, you know, and the guy
has never heard of that, and you say, okay, I don't know
if this is a green-eyed turkey, and I don't know if it
violates the green-eyed turkey statute, but maybe it
violates something.  You know, and that sounds like an
odd principle, even if you limit to all laws concerning
birds.  And -- do you see the problem?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I -- I understand the
Court's concern.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And I suddenly worry the
government's going to start -- he's skulking around in
the bushes, you see.
(Laughter.)
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  We can go on like this, but
I think I better not.
MS. HARRINGTON:  So I think that has not
turned out to be a real world problem, and I
certainly understand the Court's concern, and I'm not
trying to sort of blow it off or avoid answering it.  I
do think in the willful context, that that has -- the
Court in Bryan said that's sufficient if -- if the --
the defendant correctly believes that what he's doing is
illegal, he doesn't have to have any sense of what law
he's violating.
Now, willfulness is generally thought to be
a much higher mens rea standard than knowing or
intentional, and although this Court has never addressed
this precise question, both the model penal code and the
Brown Commission Report have embraced the idea that when
you satisfy a higher mens rea standard, you necessarily
satisfy all the lower ones.  Having said that, I
understand the Court's concern -- I don't mean to
interrupt you, Mr. Chief Justice -- but -- and so we are
embracing a narrower articulation for the purposes of
this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you say
you're embracing the narrower articulation, but it seems
to me that's just a case-specific one, and Justice Alito
is right, it's hard to see how that would make a
difference here.  But I think it could make a world of
difference when you expand that to the other cases
involving mens rea.  And when you get to that point, it
is sort of an ignorance of the law question.  I mean, in
all the cases involving mens rea, we do not ask whether
you have any idea whether it violates the law or not.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, in the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And -- and we --
your position makes it much easier to convict people
because you don't have to show that they even knew the
facts that made their conduct illegal.  All you have to
do is say that -- under -- illegal under the law that
they're being charged.  All you have to do is say, they
did something that makes it look like they knew that --
they did something that makes it look that they were
suspicious.  And if we can find any law in the
United States Code that makes what they did illegal, we
can prosecute them for what we want to prosecute them
for, even though they didn't know that the facts fell
under that provision.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, you have to prosecute
them for the -- for the -- for the actions they actually
took that broke the law, I mean --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, and part of
that prosecution is you must show that they had the
requisite mens rea.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And what you're
saying is, we can show that simply by showing the jury
that they were acting suspiciously.
MS. HARRINGTON:  I mean, I don't think
that's quite correct.  We have to convince the jury that
the defendant in any case believed that what he was
doing -- that the relevant conduct, which is in this
case would be distributing the drug, violated the law,
was illegal.  You have to prove that beyond a reasonable
doubt.  And so just merely suggesting to the jury that a
defendant was acting suspiciously, I think is not going
to get the job done in most cases.
And I do think in most contexts it is easier
to prove that a defendant knows the facts that make his
conduct illegal than it is to prove that he knew what he
was doing was illegal --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's the best case you
can give us to help?  In Morissette, the defendant
didn't know that the surplus shell casings belonged to
the government.  And he was exonerated because he had to
have an intent.  Suppose that he -- he didn't know they
belonged to the government, but he thought that it was
an illegal casing because it was dangerous.  And he was
wrong about that.  But it did wrong -- could he be
prosecuted then?
MS. HARRINGTON:  We think he -- we think he
could be.  I mean, I think all of the cases that -- in
that line, the Morissette, Staples, all of those cases
involved defendants who claimed that they genuinely --
genuinely believed what they were doing was innocent.
And so the problem for this Court was to try to figure
out a way to construe the statute so that it didn't
sweep in people who really were innocent.  Now, this is
a case where --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what -- is there a
case you have for us?
MS. HARRINGTON:  So -- so -- the easier
cases where the defendant really truly believes that
what he's doing is illegal, and those cases tend not to
come to this Court.  There are some statements in the
opinion in Bryan.  Now, Bryan was principally a case
about the willful standard, but there was also a
discussion of a knowledge standard.  And in Bryan, the
Court said the government doesn't necessarily have to
prove that a defendant knew what he was doing was
illegal, and I think the use of necessarily there
suggests -- at least leaves open the possibility that if
the government did prove that, then it would be
sufficient.  The Court also said --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the best you have?
MS. HARRINGTON:  The Court -- the Court also
said in Bryan that the defendant -- that the government
merely needs to prove knowledge of the facts that make
his conduct illegal, suggesting that that's an easier
standard for the government to meet.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just to follow
up -- I'm sorry, just to follow up quickly on Justice
Kennedy's hypothetical, what if he knew he was
trespassing when he went on to the government property
and -- and took the casings?  You have to show he knew
what he was doing was illegal, he was trespassing.  The
sign said government property.  And so we can convict
him for taking the shell casings.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, we would we would tie
it more directly to the conduct that actually violates
the law.  And so if -- if he needs to know that the
taking of the shell casings is illegal, not that some
ancillary conduct that, you know, brought him to the
shell casings was illegal.  And so here we would say,
again, he needs -- the defendant needs to know that the
distribution of the drug is what's illegal.  And we
think, you know, if you look at the -- I think we're on
the same page with Petitioner in suggesting that the
same standard should govern both CSA cases and analogue
cases.  We just disagree about how the courts of appeals
have applied this in the CSA context.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me try this out.
Start with a drug that is on the list.  All
right.  The defendant knows the chemical composition of
the drug that's on the list.  The defendant has no idea
that this is on the list, knows nothing about the
Federal drug laws.  This person distributes it
intentionally, knowingly.
That person has violated the law.  The
person's ignorance of the fact that this is a controlled
substance is irrelevant.  Are you -- am I right so far?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes, because he knows the
identity of the drug.
JUSTICE ALITO:  He knows -- he knows what it
is.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.
JUST ALITO:  So he knows the chemical
composition.  He knows the name.  All right.
Now, let's assume that we have a list of
analogues.  It's the same thing.  If the defendant knows
that the thing is on the list, knows the chemical
composition of it, and it turns out that this is an
analogue, that is sufficient.  That's not going to be
the proof in most cases.
And I think maybe the confusion is that the
defendant -- a defendant's knowledge of the illegality
of what he or she is doing is not something that has to
be proven.  It is circumstantial evidence that the
person knows that the thing that is being distributed is
something that is on the list.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.  And, again, there's
no list in the analogue context.  It's --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I understand that.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Okay.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But it makes it easier to
understand --
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- if we imagine that there
is.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  So, no, we agree.
Our position is that if we can prove that a
defendant knew what he was doing was illegal, that's a
way of proving that he knew he was distributing a
controlled substance analogue or a controlled substance.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But it's not something that
you have to prove.  You don't have to prove that he knew
that it was illegal under Federal law, or under State
law, or under any other law.
You have to prove that he knew that it was a
substance that constitutes -- that, in fact, constitutes
an analogue.
But the fact that he knows that it's illegal
under Federal law is circumstantial evidence that he
knew that it was something that fell within that
definition.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  And it might help if
I could give you sort of a real world example of how
this has worked in the courts of appeals under the CSA.
There's a number of -- of cases in the -- in
the courts of appeals dealing with a substance called
khat, which is K-H-A-T.  Khat is a plant that's grown in
the Horn of Africa, generally, and if you pick the
leaves off the plant and chew them, it gives a stimulant
effect.  And the reason it gives a stimulant effect is
because fresh leaves of khat contain a substance called
cathinone, which is a Schedule I substance illegal under
the CSA.  It sort of produces amphetamine-like effects.
So khat is legal in many places in the
world.  It's illegal to distribute it in this country
because, again, it contains -- when freshly picked,
contains a Schedule I controlled substance.
So there are a number of cases where the
government has prosecuted people under the CSA for
distributing cathinone in the form of distributing khat.
And defendants in those cases have said, Look, I didn't
know it had cathinone, I was distributing khat.  It's
legal where I come from, I have no what the chemical is
in this -- in this plant.  And the courts of appeals
have generally upheld those convictions based on
proof -- or when there is proof that the defendant knew
that distributing the khat was illegal, even if he
didn't know why it was illegal.  Even if he didn't --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait.  The light is dawning
slightly, maybe.  Don't say I'm restating your argument
correctly if I'm not.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Please.  The --
you're -- you're saying, first, he doesn't know the
chemistry.  So he doesn't -- he has to know it's an
analogue, but he doesn't know the chemistry.
Now, you're saying, of course, if he knows
that it is illegal under the Analogue Act, that's good
enough because he knows it's an analogue.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now you're saying if he
knows it's illegal generally under the drug laws, that
should be evidence of the fact that he knows it's an
analogue because let's ask him why do you think it's
illegal under the analogue -- I mean, why do you think
it's illegal under the drug laws?  I'm going to tell you
its not a listed substance.  Why could it be?  And he'd
sort of be stuck there because he doesn't want to say,
hmm, because it's a lot like cocaine.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Because once he says
because it's a lot like cocaine, he knows it's an
analogue.  And if say, using my, you know, far out
examples, it's not because he thinks it's a veterinarian
law.
So what it should be -- is this right -- if
I follow your argument, you'd say the fact that he knows
it's illegal under the drug laws, is, itself, evidence
that he knows it's an analogue, but he's free to come up
if he wants with some kind of basis for saying that even
though he thought it was illegal under the drug laws, he
thought it was illegal under some other law that had to
do with postage stamps or something.  That -- that
should be, if the jury believes that, get him off.
Have I got it basically right?
MS. HARRINGTON:  That's a correct
characterization of our narrower argument, yes, that
if -- right.  If we can prove that the defendant
believed what he was doing violated some drug law,
that's enough to prove that he knowingly distributed an
analogue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What would "some drug
law" be other than the CSA and the Analogue Act?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.  In the Federal
context, there wouldn't be, but, again, our point is
really that the defendant, generally, does not have a
specific law in mind.  He just knows that what he's
doing is breaking the law.
And so when Petitioner says we have to prove
that he knew he was violating the -- the statute of
conviction, we think that's a -- much too high a burden.
The only time you have to do that is when you have a
willful standard in the tax evasion context; right?
This is certainly not that context.  We
think just general knowledge of illegality and intention
to engage in the prohibited act is sufficient.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- but the illegality
must relate to drugs.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Pardon me?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The illegality must
relate to drugs.
MS. HARRINGTON:  We think that's -- it's
certainly sufficient when the government proves that,
that the illegality relates to drugs.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and sufficient.  It's
not just evidence that he knew it was an analogue; it's
conclusive evidence.
MS. HARRINGTON:  We think that's correct.
Yes.  And, you know, to -- Petitioner suggests that the
courts --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So even if he comes back and
says, Yes, I thought that what I was doing was wrong,
but -- but it wasn't because I thought this was an
analogue, it was for some other reason.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, we think if he came
back, for example, and said, Well, I thought it violated
the Virginia Controlled Substances Act -- and because
not -- some States control more drugs than the
Federal -- than the Federal schedules include -- but I
didn't know it violated a Federal drug law, we think
that would not be a defense.  Right?  That some
knowledge that you're violating a drug law is
sufficient.
You know, and we think in this case there is
actually --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said sufficient.  How
about necessary?  Is it necessary?  Is the drug -- is
the law that he thinks he's violating, be a drug law, is
that necessary?
MS. HARRINGTON:  So, again, we think that
there is -- that a broader view would be correct.  But
we are perfectly happy with a ruling in this case that
it -- that it would be sufficient that the government --
we don't think that there is necessarily a basis for
limiting the knowledge of illegality specifically to
drug laws.  As long as you tie the conducts to the
belief in illegality, we think that's enough.
But we think it's definitely sufficient for
this case to hold that when the government proves a
belief that -- that he is violating a drug law, that
that's enough.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so the conduct is
related to the genus of illegality.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think -- I think
there are areas where criminal defendants do try to
tailor their conduct to fall within, if they're captured
or caught, particular laws but not others.  I recall
cases where that's true.
I mean, hypothetically, let's say they know
that this much marijuana or cocaine is a misdemeanor.
If they got up to this much, you know, it's 15 years
mandatory minimum, so they structure their activities to
fall within the lower level.
You would be able to prosecute them,
according to your theory, for the big 15-year mandatory
whatever, if they happen to go beyond the misdemeanor
amount.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Certainly, yes.  You know,
if a defendant believed that he was distributing 1 pound
of cocaine and it turned out -- and that's probably,
it's, you know, I don't know what the right numbers are,
but say he believed he was distributing 1 pound of
cocaine.  Turned out, he was distributing 5 pounds of
cocaine and there's different sentence that applies for
5 pounds.  If we can prove he actually distributed 5
pounds of cocaine, then I think that would be sufficient
under the Controlled Substance Act.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what does that
do to your theory that they have to -- what they have to
know is that it's illegal under the drug laws.
What -- what was illegal -- what they knew
was the misdemeanor amount.  And you're saying, well,
that doesn't -- it doesn't matter that they -- doesn't
matter that they didn't know they were distributing the
larger amount.
MS. HARRINGTON:  So I took your hypothetical
to be that he knew what he was doing was illegal.  He
just --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He knew what he was
doing was an -- was a misdemeanor.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Okay.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Because of the
amount.  He didn't know it was a going to be a felony
because he didn't know he had that much of the drug.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, under our view, if he
knew what he was doing violated a drug law, which I
think would be the case in your hypothetical, then
that's sufficient.
Now, of course, if he thought what he was
distribute -- what he was distributing was oregano and
it turned out to the marijuana, then we think that
wouldn't be sufficient because he would have believed
what he was doing was innocent, and he wouldn't have
known the facts that made his conduct illegal.
In this case, there are -- there are plenty
of facts to show that Petitioner really believed that
what he was doing was illegal, and it turned out that he
was correct.  Again, he sold his products in little
baggies and vials instead of having sort of more
traditional commercial packaging.  He charged $450 an
ounce for these products, which sort of undercuts his
belief that he thought that they were aromatherapy
products or things that you would actually pour into a
bathtub.  He named --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you know, you charge
what the market will bear.  And if it has the same
effect -- if it has the same effect as cocaine, even if
it's perfectly legal, you should charge 400.  Don't you
believe in the free market?
(Laughter.)
MS. HARRINGTON:  Not in the illegal drug --
I mean, you know, the free market works in the illegal
drug context the same way it works everywhere else.
But I think it's certainly evidence that he
knew what he was selling was a drug, and it was an
illicit drug.  And he named the analogues after --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  All it shows is that he
knew it would give you a high.  That's all.  And -- and
so he was charging what people are willing to pay for
that.
MS. HARRINGTON:  He also acted furtively.
You know, he sort of hid his products on his website.
He wouldn't answer direct questions from his customers
about which high, you know, was most like for the
controlled substances.
And so we think there is certainly
sufficient evidence to show that Petitioner in this case
believed that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the Petitioner's
counsel agrees that there is sufficient evidence to
convict under a proper instruction.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  I mean, I think he
has a different view of what a proper instruction is.
And so, again, I understand that the Court
generally remands for application of harmless error.  We
think that would be appropriate in this case,
particularly, because the government didn't ask for this
instruction because it was following circuit precedent
below, and then defending a harsher instruction that was
actually given in the case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How can we -- when a jury
is told that human ingestion is enough, he has to -- he
has to intend that this -- these bath salts are not to
put in the bathtub, but to ingest, that's all that he --
that was the only mens rea that was charged.  Isn't that
so?
MS. HARRINGTON:  It was not the only mens
rea that was charged, Justice Ginsburg.  That was the
mens rea instruction that the government requested
because that was what circuit precedent had said was
enough.  But the instruction that was actually given,
told the jury it had to find that he knowingly
distributed a controlled substance -- a substance that
had the same pharmacological effects as a controlled
substance.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Russell, you have four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUSSELL:  Let me start with the
instruction.
Justice Ginsburg, even under the
government's interpretation of the jury instructions as
requiring the jury to find that the defendant knew about
the similarity in effect, the government acknowledges it
didn't require any knowledge about the similarity
instruction.  So the government has acknowledged that
this -- the instruction here was inadequate, even under
the government's new view of the law.  And so the
question here is simply whether or not they're entitled
to take advantage of that, and to make a harmless error
argument, based on a theory that they only developed in
this Court.
But let me -- with respect to the general
legal questions, let me start with -- with addressing
their broad "any law will do" position.  And that is
simply, as I understand them now, premised on their
thought that all the statute requires is culpable state
of mind, but that's not what the statute says.  It
doesn't say distribute an analogue culpably, it says
distribute knowingly.
And this Court has repeatedly said that
knowing distribution of a prohibited item requires
knowledge of the facts.  And there may be a -- an
exception that we've discussed that you can meet that by
showing that there's knowledge under the law of
conviction itself, but there is no precedent from this
Court that gives the court -- gives prosecutors the
option of either proving the facts, the defendant knew
the facts that made the conduct unlawful, or simply that
he acted culpably or that he knew that the conduct was
unlawful under some law.
Now, with respect to their fallback
position, that it has to be illegal under a drug law,
we're getting closer.  We would agree, if they were to
say, as some courts have said, including Hussein, which
is a case they feature prominently in their brief, that
it has to be a Federal anti-drug abuse law.  Now, the
truth of the matter is there's only one of those, but
the -- the value in that articulation is that it makes
clear that the defendant doesn't have to know the name
of the statute.
But if the government's position is that
it's enough that it be under State drug abuse laws, and
Justice Alito, there are lots of State Analogue Acts,
and there are lots of States that have been ahead of the
government in putting on their schedules things that are
analogues, including some of the substances in this
case.
That's clearly not what this Court has ever
had in mind in interpreting the word "knowingly" in a
statute.  And it's up to Congress to decide what is
culpable enough.  And when it uses the word "knowingly,"
it is entitled to know that that word is going to get
the same interpretation that it has in the past.  The
government points to cases like Bryan in which the Court
has said, in addition to knowing the facts, we must also
know something about the law.  And it says that, you
know, willfulness is enough to establish knowing --
knowing distribution.  But of course, in those cases,
it's not simply that they have some general knowledge of
unlawfulness, they also know the facts that make the
conduct unlawful.
JUSTICE ALITO:  A defendant who knowingly
distributes heroin, knows that it's heroin, doesn't have
any idea that it's illegal, nevertheless has violated
the law.  Now, I don't see why the rule should be any
different with respect to an analogue.
MR. RUSSELL:  I -- I don't say that it is.
I think they have -- they can either --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So then the defendant
doesn't have to know the legal status of -- of the drug.
MR. RUSSELL:  Again, we're talking about the
government's alternative theory.  The government always
has the option --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sorry.  If a State law
calls it an analogue, he knows he's violating the State
law, he knows this is an analogue.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, if -- if he knew that he
was violating a State Analogue Act that had the same
definition under Federal law, I think you could then ask
the jury to infer that he knew that he was violating the
Federal law.  But most of the time, as my colleague
said, the government's evidence is simply going to be
that the defendant knew that the conduct was unlawful
somehow.  And the jury is entitled --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I'm not sure that you
answered Justice Alito's question fully.
MR. RUSSELL:  I'm sorry.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  He --
MR. RUSSELL:  So --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Go ahead.
MR. RUSSELL:  So, Justice Alito, the
government never has to prove the defendant's knowledge
about the law at all, if it proves that he knows the
facts that make the conduct unlawful.  And so what we're
objecting to is the government's alternative route to
showing mens rea.  And we agree with them up to the
point of the fact that they think that it's enough to
show that the defendant knew it was violating some State
law or perhaps some provision of the FDA which regulates
substances independent of the Controlled Substances Act.
As a practical matter, in most cases, what
the government -- the proof is going to be what the
government described, which is simply that the defendant
engaged in some furtive conduct that suggests that he
knows that the substance is illegal.
And unless the -- the defendant comes
forward with some reason for the jury to think that, in
fact, he had in mind that it violated some other law, or
in fact, that he looked and -- and came to the
conclusion it doesn't violate this Controlled Substances
Act, then the jury is very likely to find mens rea
established, and we don't have any problem with that.
In this -- just to finally address the facts
of this case.  The fact that my client was distributing
things in baggies rather than vials shows that he was
doing this from his home business.  The fact that he was
charging large prices shows that he thought he had found
a loophole in the Federal drug laws.  There is no reason
in the world why he would have -- if I could finish this
sentence -- why he would have flushed his product down
the toilet when he discovered that it contained a
substance that was on the schedules if, in fact, he knew
that the other products also were illegal and didn't
care.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:13 a.m., the case in the
