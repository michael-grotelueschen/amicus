CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

States v. Woods.
Mr. Stewart.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The merits question in this case is whether
the substantial valuation misstatement penalty applies
when a taxpayer overstates his basis in property in
connection with the transaction that is later determined
to be a sham.  The threshold jurisdictional question is
whether the court, in this TEFRA partnership level
proceeding, has authority to decide that merits issue.
I'd like to begin with the jurisdictional
question.  And before I focus the Court's attention on
the text, I'd like to make two quick preliminary
observations about jurisdiction.  The first is that the
question we say is appropriate for resolution in
partnership level proceedings is not whether any
individual partner will actually be made to pay the
penalty.
There's no question in this case that the
determination whether the penalty will actually be
imposed on individual partners and, if so, in what
amount is properly reserved for partner level
proceedings.
The question is simply whether the Court, in
the partnership level proceeding, can make the threshold
determination whether the sort of error that the IRS
identifies on the partnership return can trigger a
penalty down the road if the individual partner prepares
his or her return in a manner consistent with the
partnership return.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  I thought I
understood that to be your point in your brief, but I --
there is one thing missing from here.  I also thought
you were saying that you could impose the penalty before
the amount was determined on the partnership level, that
the tax that you could, without a notice of deficiency,
require a payment upfront.
MR. STEWART:  There are two separate
questions here.  The first is what can be determined at
the partnership level?  And once the partnership level
proceedings are complete, there are subsidiary partner
level proceedings.  And some partner level proceedings
require a deficiency notice, some partner level
proceedings do not.
Now, it is part of our position that, once
the applicability of the penalty has been determined at
the partnership level, the penalty can then be imposed
on individual partners in partner level proceedings
without a deficiency notice.  It can still be challenged
through a refund proceeding, but because -- there's
never the imposition of additional tax or penalties on
the partnership itself.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That is the incongruity
of your position in my mind.  You claim that the
decision of -- of whether or not or what the true value
is of the basis and how much needs to be paid can't be
determined until the partnership level -- until the
partner level determination, yet you're claiming that
you're entitled to an amount of money beforehand, before
that decision is made.  There's a tension in my mind
about that.
MR. STEWART:  Let me explain, as best I can,
the sequence of events that we think would unfold if
this Court affirmed our view of the -- both held that
the courts below had jurisdiction and agreed with our
view of the way the penalty is supposed to operate.
If the Court agreed with the position that
we take in Part 2 of our merits brief, namely, that a
deduction that is claimed in connection with a
transaction that is later determined to be a sham can
trigger -- if they agree -- if you agree with us on that
legal issue, then the IRS would examine the returns of
the individual partners, and it would verify that they
did, in fact, claim deductions in connection with this
transaction because they would have this Court's
agreement with the proposition that that's the sort of
thing that can trigger the penalty.
They would then determine what the amount of
the overpayment -- of the underpayment was, and they
would, presumably, assess a 40 percent penalty on that.
There would be a subsidiary question because the FPAA,
the Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment, said
that the partnerships were shams.  But it also said that the
individual transactions, the purchases and sales of the
options and the currency and the stock, they would be
treated as though they had been engaged in -- by the
individual partners.
And so at the partner level, there might be
further determinations about what -- what a relatively
small amount of tax the individual partners would --
would owe on that.  And then if a partner -- if a
penalty were assessed on the partner, the partner would
have to pay the penalty before challenging it in through
a refund action.  But -- but we might want to ask on
what ground could the partner want to challenge the
penalty at that point.
The partner couldn't at that stage want to
make the argument that's being made in this Court,
namely, that this is just not the sort of situation to
which the substantial valuation misstatement penalty
applies because that issue would have already been
resolved against the partner in this proceeding by
hypothesis, if the Court agrees with us on the merits.
And so the partner would have had an opportunity to get
that threshold legal issue resolved without prepaying
the penalty first.
Now, if an individual partner wanted to
raise the good faith reasonable cause defects that's
provided in 26 USC 6664(c), the partner would have to
pay the penalty first before seeking a refund.  But
that's pretty clearly consistent with Congress's intent
because Congress specified in TEFRA itself that, after
the court in the partnership level proceeding has
determined the applicability of the penalty, the partner
can still, through refund proceedings, contend that the
penalty was erroneously imposed.
And that language tells us two things.  It
tells us, first, that Congress didn't see any necessary
unfairness in requiring a partner to pay the penalty
first before raising certain sorts of challenges.
And it also indicates that, by
applicability, Congress must have meant something
different from will the penalty ultimately be imposed
because, if the partnership level determination that the
penalty was applicable meant that all the requirements
for imposition were satisfied, there'd be no room for
the partner to argue down the road that the penalty was
erroneously assessed after all.  So --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Stewart, can you
explain the difference in the two proceedings?  First,
your position that the proper review is of the final
partnership administrative adjustment.
How would the penalty be adjudicated in that
format, and if your -- if the taxpayer is right, that
the adjudication must be made at the partner level
proceeding, what would be the difference in the
character of the adjudication?
MR. STEWART:  When we say that the
applicability of the penalty should be determined in the
partnership level proceeding, all we mean is that the
court in the partnership level proceeding should resolve
the legal issue that is addressed in Part 2 of the
respective briefs for the Petitioner and the Respondent;
that is, the court should determine is the substantial
valuation misstatement penalty the sort of penalty that
can apply to a basis overstatement that is produced
through a sham transaction.
We wouldn't ask the court in the partnership
level proceeding to go beyond that legal determination
and to ask whether individual partners had actually
underpaid their tax or whether they had actually
misstated basis.  It's always theoretically possible in
a case like this that the partnership could be
determined -- that the partner could participate in sham
transactions.
But by the time it was -- he had to file his
own return, he could get cold feet or he could get legal
advice that indicated this just isn't going to work, and
so it's possible that the partner could prepare his
return in a way that was lawful.  And the IRS, after the
partnership level proceedings were complete, would have
to look at the partner return in order to see what that
had -- what had happened.
I think the main practical -- I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I was just going to ask, if
the question were determined of whether the sham
transaction counts as an erroneous statement of the
basis, if that were determined at the partner level and
not in a partnership proceeding, would it be possible to
have different outcomes --
MR. STEWART:  Yes, absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- with respect to
different partners?
MR. STEWART:  Absolutely.  And I think
that's the main practical difference between the way the
system would operate under our view of TEFRA and the way
it would operate under Respondent's view.  That is,
under --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and you have to
relitigate the same issue.
MR. STEWART:  Exactly.  Under Respondent's
view, the IRS was not required to say anything at all in
the FPAA about the potential imposition of basis
overstatement penalties down the road.  If the FPAA
adjustments -- the shamming determination had been
upheld at the partnership level, under Respondent's
view, the IRS could then assess penalties against
individual partners.
And if the individual partners raised an
objection, the same arguments that are raised in Part 2
of the Respondent's merits briefs, that would have to be
litigated potentially by different judges in different
partnership -- in different partner level proceedings
with potentially inconsistent outcomes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Would it be a fair way to
look at this to say that what you do at the partnership
level is anything that doesn't require looking at an
individual's tax return?
MR. STEWART:  I think that's a fair way to
put it.  And another way we would put it is any question
that will necessarily have the same answer for all
partners should presumptively be resolved at the
partnership level.  That is, the legal issue that's
briefed in Part 2 of the parties' respective merits
briefs, we may be right, Respondent may be right, but the
answer is going to be the same for all partners.  Either
this is the sort of basis overstatement that can trigger
the penalty or it isn't.
The second practical difference that I
wanted to -- to allude to, at least briefly, between our
position and the Respondent's is that 6226(f) is the
provision that deals with the Court's jurisdiction in a
partnership level proceeding.  6221 is the provision
that tells the IRS what it's supposed to do at the
partnership level, and it also tells the IRS determine
the applicability of any penalty that's related to an
adjustment to a partnership item.
Now -- now, one advantage of requiring the
IRS to make at least this sort of threshold
determination of penalties at the outset is that, if the
IRS makes an adjustment to a partnership item, and the
IRS believes that it is the sort of adjustment that down
the road could trigger the imposition of penalties,
that's the sort of thing an individual partner would
want to know in deciding whether to challenge the
adjustment.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it correct that your
position would allow the IRS to evade the normal statute
of limitations?
MR. STEWART:  I don't see --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Or deficiency?  No?
MR. STEWART:  I don't see how.  I'm not sure
exactly what argument you're referring to.  But there
are -- I mean, there are provisions that deal with the
way the limitations periods runs, depending on when the
partnership return is filed and when the partner returns
are filed, but I don't see how that would happen.
We -- we would still be subject in assessing
penalties against any individual partners to whatever
limitations period the code provides and either we would
or would not have obtained a legal ruling on -- on the
legal issue whether the penalties are -- are the sort
that could follow from this partnership item adjustment,
but I don't think it would have implications for the
statute of limitations.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Using the language of the
statute that you just quoted, can you explain to us what
is the adjustment of the partnership item?  That is, the
statute says, "Determine the applicability of any
penalty which relates to the adjustment of a partnership
item."  So what is -- what was the partnership item
adjustment?
MR. STEWART:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  This
is on Page 6-A of the appendix to the government’s
brief, and the adjustment to the partnership item is the
shamming determination.  The determination that the
partnerships were not engaged in for business purposes,
that they were engaged in purely as tax avoidance
measures.
And Respondent concedes that this is a
partnership item because Respondent concedes that the
district court had authority to review the shamming
determination, decide whether that determination was
appropriate.  And that concession necessarily depends
upon the proposition that the determination that the
partnerships are shams was an adjustment to a
partnership item.
And it makes sense for two reasons.  First,
because the determination whether these are valid
partnerships necessarily underlies any other
determination that the IRS would make about the proper
tax treatment of items reported on the partnership
return.
And second, it is the sort of determination
that is going to have one answer for every partner,
either the partnership is a sham or it's not.  But it
can't be the case that a particular partnership is a
sham with respect to some partners and not others.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What Judge Sentelle
said in his opinion for the D.C. Circuit is that
based -- agreeing with everything you've said, that
means that the misstatement of basis might be obvious on
the individual partner's returns.  What's wrong with it
might be obvious, but it still is made on those returns,
and therefore, that doesn't fall as a partnership item.
MR. STEWART:  Now, we would agree with Judge
Sentelle that outside basis, in and of itself, is not a
partnership item.  An outside basis, in and of itself,
is not designated as one of the things that the court in
a partnership level proceeding can determine.  But
there -- and usually, it would be inappropriate to
determine outside basis at that stage because,
typically, outside basis will vary from partner to
partner.
But there are some instances in which a
court needs to determine outside basis --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Why would it
vary from partner to partner?
MR. STEWART:  I mean, in the -- in the more
typical case, the outside basis would depend upon the
amount that a particular partner had paid for his own
partnership interest.  And so, in that situation, not
every partner would necessarily have -- have paid the
same thing.  But there are fairly rare situations in
which -- in order to make some determination that is
specified in 6226(f), the court and the IRS along the
way have to determine outside basis.
And one example we gave on page 32 of our
brief, we have a footnote that says, it's not implicated
here, but outside basis is sometimes a component of a
partnership item, such as inside basis.  And we cite a
case that was ultimately decided by this Court, but it's
a case in which a partnership took advantage of code
proceedings that said you can step up your inside basis
to max the outside basis of your partner -- partners.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, isn't it your
position in this case that outside basis in this case is
necessarily related to inside basis?
MR. STEWART:  I think -- I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or am I misstating that?
MR. STEWART:  I think what we are saying is,
in order to determine whether the substantial valuation
misstatement penalty would be triggered down the road,
the IRS and the Court would have to make certain --
would have to decide what is the proper outside basis in
a sham partnership.
If a lawyer were asked for -- if a lawyer
saw an adjustment that said we regard these partnerships
as shams, and the lawyer were asked, does that mean that
I could be subject to the substantial valuation
misstatement penalty if I reported deductions on
purported losses from that partnership, the only way the
lawyer would answer that question is to ask, well,
what's true basis in a sham partnership?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but if we were to
write an opinion which says -- an opinion ruling in your
favor, that, in this case, outside basis is necessarily
related to inside basis in this transaction, you would
say that's wrong?
MR. STEWART:  I wouldn't -- I wouldn't put
it that way.  I mean, I think in this --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why -- and why is that?
MR. STEWART:  Because I think that's not
really the reason we're saying the Court needs to -- I
pointed the Court to a different case in which outside
basis had to be determined at the partnership level for
a different reason; namely, because it was a -- in that
case, it was a component of inside basis.  And since
inside basis is a partnership item, you can only
determine that partnership item by reference to outside
basis.
Here, we have a somewhat different argument.
We're saying the thing that had to be determined at the
partnership level was the applicability of the
penalties.  And the only way you can decide whether the
substantial valuation misstatement penalty is applicable
is to determine what would be true basis in a sham
partnership.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Stewart --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Stewart --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we -- if we go over to
the merits, if this case came up today, and today, we
have a penalty that wasn't there originally and that is
for a non -- noneconomic substance penalty, would --
would the government today be going under that
noneconomic substance penalty or would it be going under
the 662(d)(3), that is the substantial valuation
misstatement?
Or is it the government's option, it can
pick one or the other?
MR. STEWART:  I think it's the government's
option.  And if you -- it may be helpful to look at page
18a of the appendix to -- to the Respondent's brief
because that actually reproduces the current version of
the code that contains the 2010 penalty that -- that
you're referring to.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If the government could
choose either one, what would determine its choice?
MR. STEWART:  I mean, in some instances, the
government will -- the government will pick the one that
it thinks is easiest to prove.  Some of the penalties
are limited to 20 percent, whereas some can be bumped up
to 40 percent, and we would look for the 40 percent
penalty.
But if I could, on page 18a, we're talking
about Section 6662(b), and it says, "Portion of
underpayment to which section applies."  And then it
says, "This section shall apply to the portion of any
underpayment which is attributable to one or more of the
following," and then it lists six items.  Subsection (3)
is the substantial valuation misstatement penalty that
we're relying on here.
Subsection (6) is a disallowance of claimed
tax benefits by reason of a transaction lacking economic
substance.  That's the -- the 2010 penalty.
Now, the two points I would make are, first,
it's very clear that many, many cases that would fall
under Subsection (6) would also fall under Subsection
(1) or (2); that is, they could involve negligence or
disregard of rules or regulations.
They could also involve a substantial
understatement of income tax, which basically means any
understatement of income tax that's 10 percent or more
of the true tax owed.  And so if there's no incongruity
in saying Subsection (6) should apply to some cases
where (1) and (2) would also apply, there shouldn't be
any greater incongruity in saying it can apply to some
cases where Subsection (3) would apply.
The other point I would make pertains to the
introductory language of that provision, and it says,
"This section shall apply to the portion of any
underpayment, which is attributable to one or more of
the following."  And I think the primary practical
significance of the "one or more" language is that it
functions as an anti-stacking provision.  It tells you
it doesn't matter whether your underpayment triggers
only one of these penalties or all six of them; you're
still limited to 20 percent, unless you can get the --
the 40 percent through some other provision.
So we can't take advantage of the fact that
the -- that more than one penalty applies to a
particular transaction by getting 20 percent on top of
20 percent on top of 20 percent.  But the very fact that
Congress used that language "which is attributable to
one or more of the following" indicates that it
anticipated situations in which particular underpayments
would be attributable to more than one of those
penalties.
It didn't see any anomaly in the idea that a
penalty that triggers Subsection (3) could trigger
Subsection (1) or (2).  And, again, there's no reason to
think that there's a greater anomaly with respect to
Subsection (6).
The other thing I would say is that, in this
case, (3) and -- if it arose in connection with a
transaction that occurred today, (3) and (6) would be
coterminous.  Either of them would apply.  But there
will be plenty of cases in which a substantial valuation
misstatement penalty on our view could be triggered by a
legal error in computing basis, such as use of the wrong
depreciation rate.  That would not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Stewart, if I
could focus at a somewhat higher level of abstraction.
I understand the general underlying thrust of your
friend's position to be that overstatement of basis goes
to -- you know, miscalculations.  It was actually
$20,000, you say it's $40,000, and that's where the
penalty comes from.
Well, this case is quite different.  We are
kind of wiping out the whole transaction, and then
you're kind of artificially saying, well, if you wipe
out the whole thing, when you come to basis it should be
this and that.  And -- and it's not sort of a fraud or
misstatement with respect to the basis itself.  It
follows from a broad sham determination, and that sham
determination is made at the partnership level, not the
partner level.
MR. STEWART:  I guess the two things that --
or at least two things I would say in response to that
are that here the whole point of the avoidance scheme
was to create an artificially inflated basis; that is,
the high, high basis that's claimed on the individual's
returns was not simply a fortuitous result of an
avoidance scheme that operated through some other means.
The whole point -- if you want to claim a
loss on a transaction where you didn't incur an actual
economic loss, you can do it either by under -- by
understating the amount that you were paid for the asset
or by overstating your basis.  And this is one of a
number of tax avoidance schemes that operate by
overstating basis.
So it's true that the transaction was
determined to be a sham, but the sham determination was
intimately bound up with the fact that the whole purpose
of the scheme was to create an inflated basis.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand that,
but if you were telling people what happened here --
maybe you would -- I don't know that your first
statement would be, they overstated their basis.  I
think you would say, they engaged in a completely sham
transaction, which had -- which had some obvious, as the
D.C. Circuit put it, some obvious consequences.  But
still, the -- the driving determination was that it was
a sham transaction.
MR. STEWART:  I guess the -- the other
couple of points I would make are, there's nothing
illegal about engaging in a transaction that lacks
economic substance; that is, if the partners had engaged
in these offsetting currency transactions, but then had
decided before filing their return that either we -- we
no longer believe that this is right conduct or we
believe we're going to get caught, and they had prepared
their returns in a lawful way, nothing bad would have
happened to them.
The -- the thing that subjects them to
potential penalties is the fact that they claimed a
large loss on their tax returns, and they did that by
claiming a large false basis in the -- the partnership.
The second thing I would say is -- you know,
when I took math in junior high and high school, the
teacher would always tell us to show your work when you
handed in an assignment, don't just give the answer at
the end; indicate the process by which you arrived at
that number.
And in essence, when the code says impose
penalties on underpayments that are attributable to the
following things, it says -- it means we're going to
look at your work.  When we determine that you have paid
too little tax, we're going to look at the calculation
process by which you arrived at the amount on your own
return and figure out where you went wrong.
And if they did that here, they would say
the mistake these taxpayers made, the reason that they didn't
pay as much tax as they owed, was not that they claimed
to have sold the assets -- it was not that they claimed
to have sold the assets for less than they actually
realized; it was that they claimed a basis that had --
had no founding in reality.
And the last thing I would say in -- in
connection with that is it's no accident that this
scheme operated through the creation of sham
partnerships; that is, if the taxpayers themselves had
bought the offsetting long and short currency options,
there would have been no colorable argument that they
could have claimed the costs --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Stewart, what --
what is this case a fight about?  And -- and -- I'm
sorry.  Perhaps I'll just ask it on rebuttal, so you can
save your time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Garre.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
On both jurisdiction and the merits, the
government is asking this Court to adopt an overly
expansive interpretation of the code to reach a result
that would upset the statutory scheme devised by
Congress and lead to further problems down the road.
Now, on jurisdiction, I think the most
important thing for the Court to recognize is that
outside basis, the very thing, as you can tell from my
friend's arguments on the merits, that the imposition of
this penalty depends on is not a partnership item.  In
fact --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Garre, it seems as
though you and the government agree on sort of the
nature of this problem, right, which is you have a
partnership item, which is the sham determination.  That
leads to an adjustment in outside basis which, as you
just said, is not a partnership item, is instead an
affected item; and that leads to a penalty, right?
So there's kind of three things, two steps
in the process.  And you say, well, that's not enough,
essentially, because the penalty has to directly relate
to a partnership item.  And they say it is enough
because it's okay if it indirectly relates to the
partnership item.
And I guess the question is, in some sense,
you're both adding adjectives to the statute.  You add
directly, they add indirectly.  How do we pick between
those?
MR. GARRE:  Well, I think the government is
asking the Court to add a great deal more than that.
Just to go to the statutory text, with the provision at
6226, and it's on page 2A of the red brief, and what
that says is that first it gives the court jurisdiction
to determine all partnership items.  Everybody agrees
that outside basis is not a partnership item.
And then it gives jurisdiction to the court
to determine penalties that relate to partnership items.
And what -- and what the government is asking this Court
to do is, essentially, to read this to say that relates
to partnership items or that relates to non-partnership
affected items, like outside basis.
And the reason why the Court shouldn't do
that is, first, in a scheme that divides the world into
partnership items that can be determined at the
partnership level and non-partnership items that must go
to the partner level, when Congress says "partnership
item," that's significant.
It -- it adds defined terms of
"non-partnership item" or "affected item."  It said
"partnership item."  So we think that it necessarily
excluded non-partnership affected items here, and that's
the way to read it.
And second, if you read the "relates to" as
broadly as the government says, then it makes no sense.
The partnership item here might as well say "affected
item" because you're right, at some level of
abstraction, you can always say that the penalty relates
to the partnership item.  That's going to be true for
lots of these.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it doesn't just say
partnership items.  Yes, "A court in which jurisdiction
a petition is filed shall have jurisdiction to determine
all partnership items."  But then it goes on, "The
proper allocation of such items among the partners and
the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or
additional amount which relates to an adjustment to a
partnership item."
MR. GARRE:  You're right, Justice Scalia,
and --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what can that
possibly mean when you're talking about the
applicability of any penalty?
MR. GARRE:  Well, let me tell you,
Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That penalty is going to be
applicable at the partner stage.
MR. GARRE:  Justice Scalia, let me answer it
this way:  Partnerships can do many things, just like
individuals and corporations, and they can engage in
things that subject -- that trigger penalties.  A
partnership can misreport its income.  A partnership can
make a valuation misstatement.  A partnership can engage
in negligence, and the court can determine those -- the
applicability of those penalties.
Now, it's true that, down the road, in -- in
a mathematical adjustment, the court is looking to
whether or not the partner repeated that error on its
return.  But what's fundamentally different about this
case is the penalty depends not on the partnership, just
the partnership item; it depends on this outside basis
determination that a court can't make.  I mean, to put
it another way --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, are there cases in
which the partnership is liable for a penalty?
MR. GARRE:  Ultimately, Your Honor, the
partner --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, I understand it's
all passed through and so forth, But suppose the
partnership does something that's a sham, that's a
fraud, and then -- and -- and files a partnership
information return with that -- with that information,
but then the partners find out, either because of a
ruling of the court that it's void or because they have
second thoughts that they're not going to do that, so
they change their individual -- they change their --
their own tax return.
Could there be any penalty against the
partnership in that instance?
MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, the partners don't
actually -- the partnership does not pay the penalty,
but the partner -- the partnership --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would there be any penalty
against the partners in that instance that I put?
MR. GARRE:  No, I don't believe so, but the
partnership --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would there be criminal
liability for filing a false information return?
MR. GARRE:  I mean, ultimately, I think that
would trickle down to the partners.  But, Your Honor, I
think there are two different schemes here.  One is
where the partnership is doing things that actually does
trigger the penalty.  Take the 2010 noneconomic
substance transaction.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then -- then that --
that just fortifies the point that Justice Scalia made,
that applicability of the penalty, it's -- it's
always going to relate to the partners.
MR. GARRE:  Yes and no, Your Honor.  Yes, in
the sense that, ultimately, what you're looking in the
proper proceeding is to determine whether or not the
partner repeated the error that's on the partnership
return, but you can say, at the partnership level, that
a penalty is -- is applicable because everything is
complete.  All the elements can be determined.  The
partnership has misreported its income.
In this case, you just can't say that
because outside basis isn't reported anywhere at all on
the partnership --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So what?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what?
JUSTICE BREYER:  So what?  That is, I mean,
as I understand it, you agree that, on the partnership
level, the IRS could say the following in a
hypothetical, I'll now give you. The partnership says
that this asset has a basis of $10 million.  We sold it
for 8.  Therefore, the partnership has a loss of 2.  The
IRS says the real value is not $10 million basis, it was
a $2 million basis, and therefore, in fact, you don't
have a loss of 2, you have a gain of 8.
Moreover, your understatement was more than
400 percent or whatever the percent is -- you know, it
was a -- it was huge.  It was an $8 million -- you know,
overstatement and, therefore, penalties of 400 percent
attach.  Okay?  You agree they can say that.
MR. GARRE:  At the partnership level --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. GARRE:  -- because you're talking
about --
JUSTICE BREYER:  At the -- right correct.
MR. GARRE:  -- inside basis, not outside
basis, correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I understand you're
making this, but what they've actually done there, since
it doesn't say anything about inside/outside, is they're
saying, partners, to the extent that you use this on
your own return, remember, there's a 400 percent penalty
attached.  Okay.  You agree they can do that.
Now, what they've done here is they've said,
there is no partnership.  So to the extent that you use
this as your -- as a basis, as you use this on your
individual return, remember there's a 400 percent
penalty attached because 4 times zero or whatever it is,
you understand the mathematics.
So we haven't got any reference to
inside/outside basis here.  In both cases, it seems to
me they're doing roughly the same thing.  And so where
in the statute does it say they can't do it?  They're
saying, indeed, a penalty attaches to --
MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- the use of this
partnership by you, the partner, to reduce your taxes.
MR. GARRE:  And --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, to the extent you
don't use it, of course, you don't have to pay anything,
but to the extent you use it, you have to pay whatever
it is, plus the 400 percent.
MR. GARRE:  What the court in doing -- what
the court is doing in both of those situations is
fundamentally different.  In one case, it's looking at
the partnership return, looking at how the partnership
reported the basis and determining that the basis
overstatement penalty would apply because of the error
committed by the partnership.
That is everything that we think the court
can do under the statutory provision we just referred
to, to determine the applicability of that penalty
because it relates to a partnership item, the
partnership's statement of its income or basis on the
partnership return.
Now, what's happening here is the partner --
the penalty is applying to the partner's statement of
basis.  That outside basis doesn't appear anywhere.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So then the question is --
the question is do the words "partnership item" in the
section "scope of judicial review" refer only to those
items that the partnership in fact is concerned with?
Or do they consider the partnership itself?
MR. GARRE:  Right.  And the three --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the issue.  Okay.
MR. GARRE:  And the three circuit courts
that have addressed that have agreed with us.  And as
Justice --
JUSTICE BREYER:  We're interpreting the word
"partnership items" in that statute, and you are saying
the partnership itself is not a partnership item.
MR. GARRE:  No, not at all, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What?  No?
MR. GARRE:  What we're saying is outside
basis is not a partnership item.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, no, no, But I'm --
that's just a question of how they use it on the return.
There are many ways in which a person could use a
partnership item on the return.  If this is a
partnership item -- I mean, a person might, for example,
have no tax, in which case --
MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, I think that the
confusion maybe is between the statement at issue here.
The statement at issue in this case is the basis that
the partners reported on their individual returns as a
result of these transactions.
If you go to the partnership return and go
to page 169 of the Joint Appendix, and it may be
difficult to find now because of these fold-outs, but
you'll find what the partnership reported, and it
reported all of the transactions at issue, and it
reported accurately --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand how someone
could be confused, and I am genuinely confused.  I have
read this several times.
MR. GARRE:  Right, and --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And the reason I'm confused
is this:  That I -- I understand your difference between
the outside basis and the inside basis.  Now, what I'm
trying to do is to figure out, via the statute, I think
like what Justice Scalia was trying to do, I think,
where does that matter?
MR. GARRE:  Well, it matters in the scope of
jurisdiction, Your Honor.  And again --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I understand that, too.
I'm just trying to get the precise words of the statute
that it would make a difference because, in common
sense, it doesn't seem to me to make much difference,
but -- but maybe in this statutory language it does, so
I want to know what words.
MR. GARRE:  The words that matter is
"partnership item."  This is a statutory scheme that --
that talks about non-partnership items and partnership
items.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, you just told
me.  I said that, I thought, and you said, no, it
didn't, those weren't the right words.  But if you say
those are the right words, then explain to me why a
partnership item cannot include a partnership itself.
MR. GARRE:  The partnership item, Your
Honor, can include the partnership.  We're not -- we're
not disputing that part of the sham determination.  My
point is that the imposition of the penalty depends on
an additional determination, which is a non-partnership
item.  And the Court --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And in that sense,
Mr. Garre, it strikes me as wrong to say the words in
dispute are "partnership item."  Actually, everybody
agrees what "partnership item" means, what it includes,
and what it doesn't include.  It doesn't include outside
basis.  The government is perfectly happy to concede
that.
It seems as though the words in dispute are
what does "relate to" mean and does "relate to" have to
be "relate to" in this very direct way that excludes
this intermediate step of adjusting outside basis.
MR. GARRE:  Right.  And the reason why --
and I think that gets back to partnership item because,
if you read "relates to" in the broad sense that the
government is asking you to read it, then, in essence,
you are adding -- you're taking away the limitation of
"partnership item," and you are adding words that says
"or affected item," because what they're saying is,
look, anytime you have a partnership item that is in any
way related to the imposition of a penalty down the
road, then you can do it.
But another way of saying that, and the way
that Congress would have said if it meant it was,
courts, you can determine the applicability of any
penalty that relates to a partnership item or an
affected item.  But Congress didn't say that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it is in addition to
partnership item.  You say, oh, you can't do that
because it would add to partnership items.  But the
statute does not say "just partnership item."  It says
"partnership items, the proper allocation of such items,
and the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax,
or additional amount."
MR. GARRE:  Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's in addition to
partnership items.
MR. GARRE:  Now --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and it's -- it seems
to me, not enough to say, well, if you interpret that
third part to go beyond partnership items, you're
destroying the statute.  I don't think so.
MR. GARRE:  Our point is the one that the
D.C. Circuit and the other circuits have adopted, which
is that to make this determination you have to go beyond
the partnership item; you have to determine a
non-partnership item, and this grant of jurisdiction --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  When would you not have to
do that, if you are applying the third item, "the
applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or
additional amount which relates to adjustment to a
partnership"?
MR. GARRE:  Again --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That will always require
you to go down to the partner level.
MR. GARRE:  No.  When the penalty is -- is
complete based on what the partnership has done, you can
determine the applicability of the penalty.  You can say
all of the elements are met because of what the
partnership did.  And then, later, you're only looking
to whether or not the partners repeated that error.
Here, that's not -- that's not what's happening.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Garre, suppose the
government had asserted this penalty under sub (6), or
the transaction lacking economic substance.  Would you
be -- would you say it doesn't make any difference, it's
the same?  Or would you say that, under (6), your
argument is not applicable to that and the determination
could be made at the partnership level?
MR. GARRE:  We would, Your Honor.  The
noneconomic substance penalty that Congress passed to
cover this situation here solves all the problems.  As
to jurisdiction, courts could determine it at the
partnership level because looking to whether or not the
partnership is a sham is a partnership item.
And so courts have jurisdiction to do that.
And of course, that solves the merits question, too,
because Congress actually addressed the situation here
on the merits.  Instead, we have the government trying
to fit a square peg into a round hole.
I mean, on jurisdiction, before I go to the
merits, I just want to talk about the practical
consequences of this ruling.  It's very significant from
the standpoint of the taxpayers.  What the government
wants to do is funnel all of these penalty determinations
into a computational adjustment, as opposed to the
deficiency proceeding, which is the default rule under the
statute, Section 6230.
And from the taxpayers' perspective, that
has huge consequence.  It means that the taxpayers have
to pay the refund up front, as Justice Sotomayor
recognized.  That means that, even in disputed
penalties, they've got to pay all that up front, and
then that limits their ability to challenge it.  It
means they can't go to the Tax Court to challenge it.
They have to do it in a more expedited fashion.
The default rule is deficiency proceedings.
That is where Congress intended these penalty issues of
the type that we have here that pertain to
non-partnership items --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let me ask you
something.  There's no reason to go into a sham
transaction, except to misstate the outside basis in the
individual partnership level, so I -- it's low-hanging
fruit, according to the D.C. court.  But why shouldn't
you be able to pick it?
MR. GARRE:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, it's sort of
obvious, just as it's obvious that, if a partnership
item has a miscalculation that the partner is going to
include it in their tax return later.  That's why we
permit the penalty to be imposed up front and to pay the
tax up front because you're making an assumption that
it's been included erroneously on the partner level.
MR. GARRE:  And I think what you would
be doing is assuming a fact necessary to the penalty,
that outside basis was reported as zero, for purposes of
finding jurisdiction, and we don't think the court could
do that.
The government acknowledges that it -- that
it's at least possible that the taxpayer, in a fit of
conscience or having fully -- more fully understood the
transactions, would not inflate its basis, it would
report a zero basis, and yet nobody would know that, in
a partnership-level proceeding, because the partners'
outside basis isn't even before the court -- before the
IRS or the court in that proceeding.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Try with me again.  Again,
just try once more.  Suppose that a person owes a gift
tax and what he gave to his children or whatever was in
part an interest in a partnership.  Now, go back to my
example, all right, because I want to get -- my example
is everybody agrees that the 8, 10 million versus 8
million, there's a penalty attached.  Well, he -- he
doesn't take that into account when he gives the gift.
Now, if he did give the gift, it would --
he'd have to pay a tax on the gift, on his gift tax
return.  Okay?  He -- they assess that on the -- they
would assess that, wouldn't they, even though it's a
gift tax return, not an -- not an income tax return.
MR. GARRE.  Right.  I mean, ultimately --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So no matter what
kind of return you use, no matter what the tax
situation, if the partnership real -- real value makes a
difference, you have to put it in, don't you?
MR. GARRE:  In the individual return.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes, in individual
gift tax return.  Maybe it's in a State tax return.
Maybe it's an income tax return.
MR. GARRE:  You do, but the partner --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So it affects the taxpayer
differently, and I'm just saying, why does it matter?
MR. GARRE:  Every --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that the way this
affects the taxpayer is through what you call his
outside basis.  Why does that matter?
MR. GARRE:  Well, Your Honor, every
partner's outside basis is going to vary in the typical
situation.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes.  But of
course, any -- in my example, too, it will vary.  Of
course, it will vary.  Some people will use -- have no
tax to pay, no extra tax, because their -- their income
tax that they paid was zero.  In fact, the government
owed them a refund, so it didn't matter.  It varies in
many ways.
So since it varies in many ways and varies
by many returns, it might vary depending upon whether it
affected your outside basis or something else.
MR. GARRE:  And the fact that it can vary,
Your Honor, is one of the reasons why Congress wanted
these determinations made at the partner level.
And another thing on the jurisdictional
question.  I don't think the Court could resolve this
question looking only to the sham partnership situation
here.  Sometimes, transactions are shams; sometimes,
partnerships are shammed.  And the jurisdictional question
or answer to the question should apply across the board.
And yet, if you have a situation where you
have only a transaction shammed, then even the government
would have to acknowledge that basis could be affected
in many different ways in that situation.  And, again,
getting back --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Couldn't the government
have pursued this, instead of saying -- you know, it's a
sham partnership, just -- just -- couldn't the
government simply have said that the partnership
overstated its basis?
MR. GARRE:  It couldn't because -- and it
didn't because, again, if you go back to page 186 -- 169
of the Joint Appendix, everything about these
transactions is accurately reported on that form which
is in the partnership return.  The partnership actually
reported a gain on these transactions.
The error comes in at the partner level and
is only on the partner return in this situation.  And
that's why you can't determine outside basis at the
partnership level, and that's why you can't determine
the applicability of this penalty at the partnership
level.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, I have a second
question, which I asked your friend as well.  Is he
correct that, if we rule for you, each partner may have
a different result because different courts will find
this to be a sham or not to be a sham?
MR. GARRE:  No, no, Your Honor, in this
sense, if this Court resolves the merits question, then
that -- that ruling whether the penalty applies or not
in this context is going to apply to all partners.  So
that -- that issue is not going to vary by partner.
What can happen by partner is different
partners may have different outside basis.  Even in this
situation, my friend acknowledged you could have a
partner that, nevertheless, reports zero as his basis in
this situation and not the inflated basis
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but why -- why
wouldn't -- couldn't one court say I don't think it's a
sham partnership?
MR. GARRE:  Well, that determination, Your
Honor, is being made at the partnership level, and we
agree that it can be made at that level, and that
determination applies to all the partners.  There is no
inconsistency about that.
The only question here is whether the -- the
partnership level court can determine the applicability
of the -- the basis misstatement penalty as the
government calls it.  And -- and it doesn't have
jurisdiction to do that because it depends on that
outside basis to do it.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I think that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You say that -- you
say that that's not true because individual partners may
respond differently to the partnership determination
with respect to basis.
MR. GARRE:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Some of them are
going to put in something else, but somebody may put in
zero for a number of the reasons that the IRS's counsel
suggested.
MR. GARRE:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And now, I suspect
that those will be only in rare circumstances, and I
guess that's why the D.C. Circuit said, even though the
result here may be obvious, it nonetheless depends on
the outside basis determination.
MR. GARRE:  Exactly.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And I think what I
understand your friend to be saying is it's not just
that it's obvious, but it's ineluctable, and therefore,
it doesn't depend on the outside partnership
determinations.
So does your case hinge on the perhaps
unusual situations where you have one of these partners
having a fit of conscience and decides to put down the
real number or has some other adjustment to it?
MR. GARRE:  I -- I think largely, yes, but
if I can explain that.  First, that presents the
low-hanging fruit situation the D.C. Circuit resolved.
And we think they were right to say, even if you think
it's low hanging, you're forbidden to pick it.
Second, here, the whole partnership is
shammed, but there's certainly cases where individual
transactions are shammed.  And if individual
transactions are shammed, then the -- the outside basis
can vary widely based on the individual circumstances of
the partners.
And so there, in that situation, it's not at
all obvious or -- or necessarily true that the basis is
going to be overstated.  You have to look.  And, again,
that's why it's a completely separate
determination made -- partner level.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you give me a
concrete example?  Because I'm not quite sure about what
you're talking about.
MR. GARRE:  Well, you could have a
partnership, Your Honor, that engages in many
transactions.  And the IRS would determine that one of
the many transactions that it entered into was a sham.
That particular transaction was only designed for tax
purposes, but other transactions that it engaged in were
legitimate.
Now, in this case, the IRS is saying that
the whole -- everything the partnership did is a sham.
But in my case, some transactions are okay, some are
different.  In that case, the individual partners'
outside basis, they may have -- they may have tried to
take advantage of the sham transaction, but yet, all the
other transactions affect their basis as well in the
partnership.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm -- I'm a little
confused on this example.  Presumably, it's only if they
carried forward, which we're assuming they would have
done, carried forward the outside basis, the penalty
would have been determined just on that one transaction.
MR. GARRE:  No, because, Your Honor, again,
the penalty is based on what the individual partner
claims as his basis, and that partner is going to be
looking to everything that goes into his partnership
interest, the costs or investment in the partnership,
pertaining not only to the one transaction that we have
hypothesized has been shammed, but many other
transactions as well.
So you -- you can't conclude either that
there's been any misstatement or that any misstatement
triggers the valuation misstatement penalty here.
If I could talk a little bit about the
merits, on the merits, our fundamental question is that
the valuation misstatement penalty that Congress devised
in 1981 was not intended at all to apply to the
fundamentally different situation here where the
government is claiming not that you misstated the
correct amount of the value or that you didn't have an
accurate amount of the value or the number that you put
for basis or value, but that the thing that's the
subject of the valuation or the basis doesn't exist at
all.
I mean, we know if you look at the -- the
pre-enactment history, the post-enactment history, we
know that this is not what Congress had in mind.  If you
look at the pre-enactment history, it's all about
resolving a problem of a backlog of cases where
taxpayers were misvaluing property and the tax would --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that was the
prototypical case, Mr. Garre.  There's no question that
that's the central case that -- that Congress had in
mind, but it doesn't have to be the only case.
And they wrote words that seem to be
applicable to this case, as well as to the kind of case
that you're talking about.
MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, they have basis, and
we have context, punctuation, pre-enactment history,
post-enactment history, and structure.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  You're saying
they have text, and you have a bunch of other things.
(Laughter.)
MR. GARRE:  No, not at all, Your Honor,
because this is a valuation misstatement penalty.  The
reference to "or adjusted basis" comes in a
parenthetical, subordinate way.
And let me give you a hypothetical.  One of
my associates came up with a good example, I think.  If
you had a contract for a wedding that provided for
flowers or plants in parentheses, you would -- you would
understand that to mean flowers or plants like -- like
lilies or ferns that would accompany flowers in the
wedding.  You wouldn't read that to include an oak tree
in the middle of the reception area.
Well, the government’s basis overstatement
penalty is the oak tree in the middle of the reception
area here.  The most common situation in which basis
misstatements are made, the government acknowledges
throughout its brief, is where you misstate the price or
cost of a good.  And yet, they're moving -- which is --
which is why the reference to adjusted basis makes sense
in the statutory scheme here.  It covers that situation.
But -- but they're saying, you don't need
to -- it goes far beyond that, not only to the prosaic
situation as they call it, but to a situation where
you're not complaining about whether the thing -- what
the correct number is or what the correct amount is.
You're saying the thing doesn't exist at all.
I mean, if I donate a painting that I say is
worth $1 million to a church, and I put that on my
return, but, in fact, it turns out that I didn't donate
the painting, I may have committed a fraud.  I may have
lied about contributing the painting, but I haven't made
a valuation misstatement, nor have I misstated my basis.
And I think our -- our position is here
that, if you look at everything, as I mentioned, the
words of the statute, the context in which a basis is --
appears, the structure, there's a graduated scheme that
makes no sense with a zero basis situation, which is
essentially a nullity.
If you look at the fact that Congress
addressed this in 2010, not by amending the valuation
misstatement penalty, but by enacting a penalty designed
to apply to this situation, the noneconomic transaction
situation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So just to be clear, if
this is -- 6 had been on the books, then you would have
no quarrel with the government’s position, they could do
this at the partnership level and --
MR. GARRE:  Yes, absolutely.  That's the way
Congress designed it.  And unless --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't get the question.
If -- if what was --
MR. GARRE:  If the noneconomic substance
transaction penalty that was enacted in 2010 was on the
books, what would happen is a court could determine the
applicability of that penalty, which is based on what
the partnership did at the partnership proceeding, and
we would agree that penalty applies.
All the problems are solved by what Congress
did to address this particular situation.  The
government is trying to put that square peg in a round
hole.
And if you add everything up, I think
what's -- what's interesting about the government’s
reply brief is it doesn't contest that -- that if
there's any ambiguity here, the statute has to be read
in favor of the taxpayer.  And that's because of the
canon that this Court has recognized that tax penalties
are strictly construed in favor of the taxpayer.
Here, at a bare minimum, there is ambiguity
as to whether the Congress that passed the valuation
misstatement penalty ever intended it to apply to this
fundamentally different situation where no one disagrees
about the numbers reported on the return.
Again, if you go to the partnership return,
the transactions are accurately reported.  If you go to
the outside basis, it's true that they reported a loss,
but that's because they were following the IRS' rules
about how you treat contingent liabilities.  So that
number is actually accurate under the IRS' rules.
That's why the IRS has to come up with a
sham to get rid of the property altogether and say that
we are going to pretend that it doesn't exist at all.
But, again, that's not a valuation
misstatement.  When the penalty talks about correct
amounts, about accuracy, about value, it's trying to get
at the number that the thing is worth.  It is not
concerned with a situation in which the IRS is claiming
that the property doesn't exist at all.
That -- that is a different problem.
Congress addressed it in a direct way, in a noneconomic
substance penalty.  So this Court doesn't have to worry
about this problem being unaddressed.
But what it should do is correctly interpret
the penalty that Congress enacted, which was on the
books when these events occurred, which is the valuation
misstatement penalty it is not the all-encompassing basis
overstatement penalty.
I think, if you're going to read one of the
amicus briefs, read the Shakow amicus brief.  It talks
about all the additional situations, which IRS or
Congress never applied this penalty to which would be
swept in by the government's position here today.
Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Stewart, you have five minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice.
Justice Kagan, I agree with your point that,
on the jurisdictional issue, the crucial contested
language is "relates to," and the issue is whether the
basis overstatement penalty here relates to the sham --
JUSTICE BREYER:  How does it not?
"Partnership items" is defined to include legal and
factual determinations that underlie the determination,
among other things, of income, credit, gain/loss.
Okay.  Whether there is a partnership at all
does underlie the determination of whether the
partnership return, which had all kinds of numbers on
it, if it shows anything.
MR. STEWART:  That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So therefore,
it's a partnership item.  Does this penalty relate to a
partnership item?  I don't want to say that you are
right for the wrong reasons, so you better be sure I'm
right.
That is, the -- the -- does it relate to a
partnership item?  I just told you what a partnership
item was.  It certainly seems to because zero is what it
relates to.
MR. STEWART:  I mean --
JUSTICE BREYER:  End of case?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Perhaps --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It can't be that simple.
We have three courts here --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let me -- let me
pose perhaps a less friendly question.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you do with
your friend's hypothetical?  On the tax returns, you
say, I gave a painting to a charity worth a million
dollars. Andin fact, he did not.
And he says, what you are doing is you are
going to go in and say, That wasn't worth a million
dollars; it was worth nothing, when, in fact, what you
should be saying is, You didn't give the painting at
all.
MR. STEWART:  I think this is a different
situation because the IRS did not determine that the
underlying transactions, the purchases and sale of
currency options and so forth, didn't occur.  It
determined that the partnerships were shams.  And I
think that this is an important point.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well -- but if you
determine that the partnerships were shams, that's like
saying that there were no partnerships.
MR. STEWART:  There were no partnerships --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And if you
say -- you know, I didn't really give the painting, that
means that there wasn't any painting.  It seems to me
they're pretty closely parallel.
MR. STEWART:  But what the FPAA also said
was, because there were no partnerships, the
transactions should be treated as though they had --
were engaged in by the individual partners.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Maybe it was a frame with
a blank canvas.
MR. STEWART:  Well -- and I -- and I think,
as -- as I was starting to say at the close of my
opening argument, it's no accident that partnerships
were used to effectuate this scheme because, if the
individuals had bought and sold the offsetting foreign
currency options, they would have had no colorable
rationale for contending that they were entitled to a
deduction for the cost of the long option, but they were
not required to treat as income the amount they received
from the short option.
It would have been absolutely clear that the
transaction, taken as a whole, was a wash.  The only way
that they could try to create the appearance of a paper
loss was by manipulating the rules that govern the
computation of basis in partnerships.  And so the
shamming determination, in effect, was a determination
that, for tax purposes, you can't try to take advantage
of the Helmer rule that says that, for computing basis
in a partnership, we will ignore the -- the contingent
liability created by the short option.
The -- the one thing -- other thing I would
say on the merits as to why we care about this case is
that Respondent's argument doesn't just go to -- on --
on Subsection 3, doesn't just go to basis overstatements
that are produced through sham transactions.  It goes to
all basis overstatements that are produced through legal
errors.  And I think that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you -- do you
agree that the new legislation completely resolves this
problem?
MR. STEWART:  It completely resolves the
specific problem posed by this -- almost completely
resolves the specific problem.
Subsection 6 undoubtedly would cover this
case.  Now, Subsection 6, the trigger for having a
40 percent penalty, rather than a 20 percent penalty is
slightly different.  Under Subsection 6, you are -- if
you disclose the relevant information on your tax
return, then even if it's later determined that the
transaction lacked economic substance, you would be
subject only to the 20 percent penalty.
Under Subsection 3, you can get the
40 percent if the overstatement is 400 percent or more
regardless of disclosure.  But it almost completely
covers it.  But other -- other --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you -- could you
go back just one moment to the practical point that your
brother made?  Is this issue only about whether you
collect the tax beforehand or after?  Because he says
that they are bound in a partner-level proceeding to the
finding that the outside basis was -- benefit was
claimed in the partnership level it was zero.
MR. STEWART:  With respect to jurisdiction,
the question simply goes to the allocation of
responsibilities between the partnership-level court and
the partner-level court.
Now, when he says we are trying to avoid
deficiency proceedings, I -- I think it ignores the fact
that, under our reading, the important legal objections
that Respondent has made to the penalty, namely the arguments
that are set forth in Part 2 of their brief, can resolve –
under our theory, can be resolved at the partnership level
without prepayment of penalties.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
