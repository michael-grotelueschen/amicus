ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. PETRO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PETRO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
The purpose of any hearing process is to get a
better answer. If the question is what happened in the
past, an adversarial fact-finding can help provide the
answers. If, however, the question seeks to look forward
and predict future behavior, then a slightly more limited
procedure will serve to expedite and arrive at the best
possible answer to this predictive question.
JUSTICE SCALIA: General Petro, before you get
into the details of why -- why you think the process here
was all that was due, I'm -- I'm more concerned about the
preliminary question of whether there was a liberty
interest here. I -- I know you haven't challenged the
existence of it, but I'm not sure that lets me off the
hook.
We -- we had a case some years ago in which both
sides apparently wanted the statute in existence and they
conceded in the -- in the court of appeals that the
statute existed and wanted us to say what this
presumptively existing statute said. And we held, since
there was serious doubt about whether the statute had been
properly enacted, we had to reach that question first
because we were not going to speculate on what a, you
know, hypothetical statute said.
And I think you're asking us to do sort of the
same thing here. You're -- if -- you know, without even
conceding or -- the Government doesn't concede anyway.
The United States doesn't.
MR. PETRO: No they don't.
JUSTICE SCAIA: You're asking us to hold that
if this is covered by the Due Process Clause, what you've
given here is enough. But I don't -- I don't like to
speculate on -- on hypothetical questions like that.
And it -- it really seems to me that to say that
there's a liberty interest here flies in the face of our
more reasoned opinions in this area, especially Sandin
which -- which has some language that's -- that's almost
-- almost right on point. We note also that this -- where
is it? Conner's confinement did not exceed similar but
totally discretionary confinement in either duration or
degree of restriction.
I -- I don't understand how this person has a
liberty interest in not -- in not being put in a maximum
security facility. Presumably you could put all your
prisoners in maximum security. I mean, you don't pull
their fingernails or anything, do you?
MR. PETRO: No -- no, we don't, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So there's -- there's no Eighth
Amendment problem.
MR. PETRO: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So if you wanted to, you could
put all of your prisoners in maximum security. Right?
MR. PETRO: Yes, I agree, Your Honor, that we
could.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So where is the liberty
interest here? I don't understand.
MR. PETRO: We -- we made a decision in
petitioning the Court that the liberty interest issue was
something that we would not raise. We raised it on appeal
through the district court and through the circuit court.
We chose not to raise it here to focus on the due process
issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I understand, but I feel
like something of a fool being asked, you know, Justice
Scalia, if -- if there were a liberty interest here, would
these procedures be enough to secure it. That's not the
kind of work I usually do. I -- you know, I usually ask
-- answer real questions.
MR. PETRO: The -- the circuit court made a
factual determination that there was a significant and
atypical deprivation. We would respectfully disagree with
that determination, but because it was a factual
determination, we chose to confine our appeal to the issue
of law.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but there is a -- there
is a question of law involved as to whether there's a
liberty interest.
MR. PETRO: Yes.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: In the Sandin case in 1995,
this Court said that prisoners have a State-created
liberty interest only where the deprivation or restraint
imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in
relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.
Now, I guess to be categorized in category 5 in
your State, it does involve putting someone in solitary
confinement, reducing their time for exercise, and
reducing their options for parole. Is that correct?
MR. PETRO: That is correct. But when people
are moved to level 5, Your Honor, typically they're being
moved from level 4, at least more than 90 percent of the
time, and level 4 has a similar area of restriction. In
reality, I would argue -- and I would concur with Justice
Scalia -- that this is not a significant or atypical
deprivation --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, do you take the -- why
don't you simplify it by telling us whether you take the
position today that there is or is not a liberty interest
here?
MR. PETRO: Your Honor, we chose not to --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I know you did.
MR. PETRO: -- petition on that.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm asking you your opinion.
MR. PETRO: Your Honor, I would be most pleased
to argue that there is no liberty interest in this
instance under Sandin. The Court made it very clear that
where there is a mandatory State-created interest, that
interest would have to involve a significant and atypical
deprivation. In this instance, we do not believe that
moving an inmate to level 5 classification is a
significant or atypical deprivation.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What if he were moved from
level 1 to level 5?
MR. PETRO: Your Honor, that has not occurred in
reality. There have been several inmates that have moved
from admission to level 5.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But why isn't the comparison
the entire prison population rather than just 5 versus 4?
MR. PETRO: Your Honor, it's just typically what
occurs, and so there are some circumstances where a level
inmate may be moved to 5, but in any event, that inmate
would have been moved to 4. The classification jump is,
in a practical standpoint --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it -- is it your view
that we should consider it the normal practice in the Ohio
system to keep people in solitary for 23 hours a day?
MR. PETRO: Your Honor, that's not the normal
practice. In fact, it involves --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then isn't that the
standard of reference that we should use?
MR. PETRO: Your Honor, it involves a small
number of inmates, and those inmates have been determined
through a very predictive determination that -- that in
fact they do pose a threat --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So we're -- we're dealing with
a small number of inmates out of a very large population,
but isn't the frame of reference for telling whether it's
a liberty interest a comparison to the large population?
MR. PETRO: Your Honor, the -- the deprivation
is -- is perhaps marginally greater, but I would suggest
that it is marginal, and therefore --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say it's marginally
greater than 4. It's not marginally greater than 1 or 2
certainly.
MR. PETRO: Your Honor, I would submit that it
is -- it is more -- it is much greater than 4. But
whether it represents something that is unexpected by the
inmate, in reality the inmate has an expectation of having
his liberty essentially extremely limited in this
instance --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but the -- the point of
the case is that the inmate does not expect to be put in
solitary confinement for 23 or 23 and a half hours a day
for a period of 1, 2, or more years without some process
to do it because that is so extraordinarily onerous and so
different from the general run of incarceration practice.
MR. PETRO: And -- and, Your Honor, we initiated
a process. It is our New Policy 111-07, which the
district court and then the circuit court ultimately ruled
on, where we made --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- but that's what --
that's what you wanted to talk about, but we're on, first,
the preliminary question.
MR. PETRO: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is -- I think you started
to say that you regarded atypical and significant as a
fact-finding which was made against you --
MR. PETRO: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- based on the extreme
conditions of this kind of confinement where you don't see
another human.
MR. PETRO: Yet, Your Honor, we would -- I would
continue to -- to argue that it is not -- if it is
significant and atypical, it is marginally significant and
atypical.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't solitary confinement
involved in Sandin?
MR. PETRO: Yes, it was.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't we say in Sandin that
solitary confinement was -- was not enough to -- to
create --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: For how long?
JUSTICE SOUTER: 30 -- for 30 days I believe,
wasn't it?
MR. PETRO: Yes, it was, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Not 1 year, 2 years, 3 years.
MR. PETRO: No. And in this case the -- but --
but level 5 as a classification is a limited confinement.
It is reserved for those very dangerous inmates not
dissimilar to Sandin.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but typically it has
been represented maybe -- maybe wrongly -- typically it
has been represented that they tend to be in there for a
year or 2-year periods.
MR. PETRO: Your Honor, they are reviewed from a
classification standpoint on an annual basis. They are
reviewed from a privilege standpoint -- and there's
different levels within 5 -- on a quarterly basis and
so --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But in -- but in fact, they
tend to be in there for the extended periods of time.
Isn't that --
MR. PETRO: That -- that's correct, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. -- General Petro,
I for one would like to hear what you have to say about
the question presented in your petition for certiorari.
MR. PETRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
(Laughter.)
MR. PETRO: In this instance, the process due,
as provided by Ohio, was outlined in New Policy 111-07.
That policy was adopted and ultimately then reviewed by
the district court. The district court held it to be
unconstitutional and added a number of other procedures.
The process that was contained in New Policy
1-07 was a predictive policy, and it understood --
JUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I just ask you a
question about that? I realize that there is a predictive
element. I don't think anyone disputes that. One of the
points of contention here, as I understand it, is that
even the new policy did not give a -- an -- an inmate a
statement of the charge or reason for the -- for the
reclassification to 5. Is -- is that correct?
MR. PETRO: Your Honor, it gave notice, 48 hours
in advance, under the new policy --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Notice of what?
MR. PETRO: Notice of the fact that there would
be a reclassification.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But did it give notice of the
reason for the reclassification? You did such and such.
You are such and such kind of person, a gang member. Does
it tell him anything?
MR. PETRO: It doesn't spell out -- in New
Policy 111-07, it doesn't spell out all the evidence, but
it gives a basic --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, not the evidence, just the
reason.
MR. PETRO: It gives a basic statement that
you're being considered for reclassification.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I know that, but does it
say you're being reconsidered for -- considered for
reclassification because you hit somebody over the head or
because you've shown that you're a member of a gang or
some other reason?
MR. PETRO: It -- it as a general rule does not
have to do that, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- I mean, the
person, if he reads the regulation, would see that it says
that to classify him, the State has to show that through
repetitive and seriously disruptive behavior, he has
demonstrated a chronic inability to adjust as evidenced by
repeated class 2 rule violations.
MR. PETRO: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: So I guess he would like to
know give me at least a vague idea of what behavior you're
talking about and which class 2 rule violations you're
talking about. Now, does the notice tell him those two
things?
MR. PETRO: The notice is very general in its
nature. At the time that the hearing actually commences,
there's an opportunity to sit down and actually discuss
with the inmate, and the inmate can respond in writing or
in presence at the -- at the hearing --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say he has the
opportunity. Do you actually tell him you are about to be
reclassified or our proposal is to reclassify you because
you violated this particular regulation by this particular
conduct?
MR. PETRO: There is -- what initiates the
reclassification is a report form that would identify to
the inmate --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm asking you what you tell
the inmate, not what initiates your process. Now, please
answer my question.
MR. PETRO: The inmate, Your Honor, has access
to the report form that says specifically what's
initiated.
JUSTICE SOUTER: At which point does he get --
at which point does he get access?
MR. PETRO: At the point of notice.
JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so this -- I mean, that's
what I don't understand what this case is about because I
-- I'm amazed that -- I think it is too detailed what
they're requiring of you, by far.
But the elements are I have to know. I'm an
inmate. I want to know what is this about. Suppose I
think they're wrong. I need to know how to tell them
they're wrong. And the other thing I think I'd need to
know is after the committee or the warden decides against
me, what are his reasons. I'm not asking for a book. All
I want to know are the basic reasons.
Now, those things I can't work out from the
briefs, quite honestly, whether the new policy gives him
those new things, those two things, or doesn't.
MR. PETRO: The new policy gives him the basic
information that we are asserting that --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, already you say that, but
I would think the basic information includes some idea of
what my disruptive behavior was and some idea of what the
class 2 violations that I was convicted of were. And now,
I've heard you both say that he does get it and that he
doesn't get it. I'm sure that's my fault, but I want to
know, does he get this information before the hearing, or
does he not?
MR. PETRO: Your Honor, he gets the basic reason
for the classification and that's --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now -- you heard what I said.
MR. PETRO: Yes, I did, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Does he get what I just said?
MR. PETRO: Yes, he does.
JUSTICE BREYER: He does.
MR. PETRO: He gets the basic information. He
doesn't get a list of any evidence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what does he -- can you
-- can you describe it for us what -- he gets 48 hours
notice.
MR. PETRO: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Notice that's there's going to
be a hearing. What else does he get? Does he get a
summary of the written report? Does he get a -- a
statement of -- of the reasons? What --
MR. PETRO: At the close of the hearing, he --
there is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Before the hearing
starts, he gets 48 hours notice, but is he -- is he just
told there's going to be a hearing in 48 hours and that's
MR. PETRO: There's going to be a hearing and
it's for reclassification, and here is -- here is the --
the actual report that actually identifies what has
triggered this activity for reclassification.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So he does get the report.
MR. PETRO: So he gets --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: 48 hours --
MR. PETRO: But it's a very bare bones report
and it doesn't identify the specific evidence involved
which --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I don't care that he
doesn't have evidence.
MR. PETRO: Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER: I want to know that he thinks
he's being sent to this prison because his roommate, Rat
Fink, has made up a bunch of stories about him. All
right? So he needs to know whether -- what it is that --
that this board is considering before he can come in and
explain what it isn't true. He doesn't have to have all
the evidence. He has to know what the point is, what the
charge is, what the claim is. And you're saying he gets
it because he has the report.
Is there an example in the record of a report?
MR. PETRO: There's an example of the report
form that is filled out by the prison officials at the
time that a reclassification is going to occur, and the
inmate does have access to that report form at the time of
notice.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Perhaps we can be concrete.
If he -- suppose the charge is he is a gang leader. Will
he get notice that says you are being considered for
reclassification because you are a gang leader?
MR. PETRO: Yes, Your Honor, he does get that
notice. He gets that basic form that basically says he's
being reclassified.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not that he's been
reclassified, but is the reason -- the reason that you are
being reclassified is that you are a gang leader. Those
-- those words, you are a gang leader. Will he get those?
MR. PETRO: He gets the -- the accusation. He
knows the accusation is made from the report form that is
prepared by the prison officials. So he knows --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I --
MR. PETRO: -- that one of those criteria has
been asserted --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this question?
MR. PETRO: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just -- is the procedure
you're describing the procedure that was reviewed by the
district court?
MR. PETRO: The procedure. Yes, it is. New
Policy 111-07 is what the district court reviewed and then
what was further reviewed by the circuit court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So the evidence in the record
before the district court describes exactly what you're
describing.
MR. PETRO: The evidence that's in the record
was the procedure in place prior to the enactment of New
Policy 111-07, and the court choose -- chose to review for
procedural purposes Policy 111-07 and then make its
decision based on New Policy 111-07. So the evidence
that's in the record, the testimony at the -- during the
trial, really is not relevant to this policy. It's
relevant to the former policy.
If -- if --
JUSTICE SOUTER: General Petro, I -- I don't --
I'm going to ask you a very tendentious question, but it's
something I don't want to make a mistake on. Going back
to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, when he is
given what you described as the bare bones report at the
beginning of the proceedings, when he gets the 48-hour
notice, will in her example the bare bones report say you
are being reconsidered for reclassification because you
are believed to be a gang leader? Does he get the gang
leader information?
MR. PETRO: Yes, he does generally. It doesn't
give any evidence. It simply is --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm not --
MR. PETRO: Okay.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not worried about evidence.
MR. PETRO: I understand.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Just I want to know the charge.
Will he always get the charge?
MR. PETRO: He will get the -- there is a form
that is completed, a long form that is completed by the
prison officials that basically stipulates the predicate
act or the predicate acts that really result in the
reclassification action.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So that in the gang leader
example, he will be told that it's because he is accused
of being a gang leader that this is occurring.
MR. PETRO: Yes, because that is part of the
form.
With the Court's permission --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And the form -- and the form
is in the record, I take it.
MR. PETRO: Yes, it is.
With the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Where?
MR. PETRO: With the Court's permission, I'd
like to reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General
Petro.
Ms. Maynard, we'll hear from you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, before you start,
maybe you could answer the question I tried to ask at the
end of his argument. Where in the record is the report?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. MAYNARD: JA-58 is the form, and if you look
at that, you'll see that it has a line that says, you are
being considered for a transfer for the following reasons,
colon, and there's a blank to be filled in.
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The procedures that Ohio provides for placement
into its supermax prison facility are more than ample to
satisfy due process.
As the Federal Government has argued in its
brief, the Bureau of Prisons believes there is no liberty
interest implicated here. But even if one assumes that
there is, the type of decision at issue is inherently a
predictive one that turns on the holistic judgment of
prison officials.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it a predictive
judgment that a person is a gang leader? The ultimate
decision, given the facts and circumstances, we predict
that this person is among the worst of the worst, but the
findings that have to be made along the way are not
necessarily predictive. I mean, it -- it would be nice if
the -- if the issues came simply divided what happened in
the past, what might happen in the future, but the
judgment that's made to classify someone as 5 inevitably
involves some, well, what happened in the past on the
basis of which we can project what might happen in the
future.
MS. MAYNARD: That's true, Justice Ginsburg. We
would have three responses to that.
One is first in Ohio, as in the Federal Bureau
of Prisons, in the large majority of instances, most of
the facts upon which a predictive assessment would turn
have already been subject to some more formal type --
trial-type procedure. For example, in the Bureau of
Prisons, the vast majority of prisoners who are placed in
one of our two more restrictive facilities have committed
some violent act in prison for which they have been found
to be guilty pursuant to formal Wolff-type, trial-type
procedures.
Secondly, with respect to facts that might be
taken into consideration for which there hasn't yet been
such a formal trial-type proceeding, this Court has made
clear that when you're talking about the types of
predictive risk assessments that are at issue here, it is
appropriate for prison officials, using their expertise
and judgment and knowledge of the prison conditions in
their prison and in the prison system as a whole, to take
into account things that are rumor, innuendo, and other
imponderables that may not have been proven in any fact-
type proceeding.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would be -- that
would be a what happened question, not what might happen.
What happened, the determination might be made on the
basis of rumor or innuendo. My only point is that
questions don't come labeled so simply, predictive versus
what happened in the past.
MS. MAYNARD: That's true. I agree with that.
But again, I believe that most of the -- the facts upon
which these decisions are based and -- and Ohio asserts in
its brief that that's the case in their case too, that
people who are placed in level 5 have either been subject
of a rule board's infraction hearing or have committed a
crime for which they've been convicted while in prison.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And suppose neither of those
are -- are so.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, I -- as I say, I think in
the vast majority of cases, in both the Federal system and
Ohio, that is the case. But even so, the consideration at
issue takes into a broader spectrum of consideration than
just the individual inmate. Having the type of formal
fact-finding retrospective proceeding that the court below
required here is going to focus the decision-maker in the
wrong direction and on a more narrow set of facts than
ideally we want the prison administrators to focus upon.
We want them to be looking at, just like in Hewitt, the
relationship of this inmate to other inmates, of inmates
within the prison generally, of inmates to this inmate,
and the safety of others. So there's more of them at
stake. There are other private interests at stake besides
those of the individual who may be moved in the prison
administration's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, those two, it seems to
me, are all questions of -- of fact. I mean, ultimately
your position may be correct, but I -- I just can't place
a lot of store in this predictive versus nonpredictive
judgment, and it's contrary to your own argument. You
say, well, in almost all the cases, it's because he's been
convicted of a crime in prison and so forth. Well, that
-- that undercuts, it seems to me, the -- the basic
argument that you're trying to make that established this
line between predictive and nonpredictive judgment.
I -- I suppose you would say even in cases where
it is a matter of past effect, these procedures are -- are
adequate. Or would you?
MS. MAYNARD: Yes. We believe that the
procedures that Ohio provides are -- are more than
adequate because it gives the prisoner notice of the
charges and an opportunity to contest the placement
decision. In fact, we believe that the -- the process
that Ohio provides is more than is necessary to satisfy
due process.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Maynard, this is a class
action, isn't it?
MS. MAYNARD: Yes, it is, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if for some of
the prisoners, maybe a majority of the prisoners, this --
this reality of having a prior factual hearing exists, but
for some of it, it doesn't? What -- what disposition
would this Court then make of the case?
MS. MAYNARD: There's -- still, the appropriate
analysis, when you're talking about -- basically what we
have at bottom --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But I mean, suppose I think
that a -- a trial-type proceeding is necessary, and in
fact, it's been given for most of the people in this class
action, but not for the rest. What happens to the case?
MS. MAYNARD: It seems to me that you hold that
-- that the procedures here are adequate because -- under
the Due Process Clause because in the broad range of
cases, you're going to have sufficient notice and an
opportunity to contest.
Again, I think it's really important to
understand the nature of the decision issued here. It's
really a gestalt judgment of prison officials exercising
their expertise in an area that this Court has repeatedly
said prison officials get a wide range of deference.
Again, I would like to make a point about the
Federal Bureau of Prisons because the respondents have
pointed to our control unit procedures which are more
trial-like. And I just want to let the Court know that
those procedures were imposed upon the Federal Government
and the Bureau of Prisons pursuant to a court order in
78 before this Court issued its decision in cases such
as Hewitt where the Court made clear this distinction
about prison placement and issues involving the judgment
and predictive decisions of prison administrators. When
the Bureau of Prisons has been --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you ask for -- did the
Government move for modification of a decree? I -- I
assume that it was not a decision of this Court. You said
this -- what you do in the supermax at the Federal level
has been imposed by a court. Which court?
MS. MAYNARD: Let me clarify one thing. What --
it would be -- this relates only to the control unit,
which is now at -- at -- in -- in part of the ADX Florence
facility. It does not apply to the general populations of
the ADX Florence facility and the Marion facility.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you talked about
something being imposed.
MS. MAYNARD: Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so I want to know what
was imposed, first, by whom, by which court, and what --
what the order was.
MS. MAYNARD: The injunction was entered by the
Eastern District of Illinois and was affirmed by the
Seventh Circuit in a case called Bono v. Saxby. And the
Federal court -- the -- the Bureau of Prisons adopted the
regulations pointed to by the respondents in the C.F.R. as
it -- in -- in -- to comply with that injunction. We have
not yet sought to have that injunction set aside, but
those procedures apply to a very small number of Federal
prisoners.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But even so, I mean, you were
saying this was forced on -- on the -- effectively on the
Government. Well, it seems to me if that were the case,
you would, after this Court rendered the decisions it did
in Hewitt and Sandin, say, Seventh Circuit, please
reconsider. It sounds to me as though you haven't done
that so you probably think it's okay.
MS. MAYNARD: We don't think it's
constitutionally required, Justice Ginsburg. It hasn't --
we haven't moved to set it aside because it hasn't caused
an administrative burden. There are currently only 49
inmates in the control unit at Florence. In the last
decade, we have only placed 118 inmates there, and so we
were able to cope with these burdensome procedures with
respect to those numbers.
But it's important to note that what we do when
we -- what the Bureau of Prisons does when it was free to
decide its own process is detailed at pages 26 to 28 of
our brief, and that applies to a large number of
prisoners, 550 who are in the general populations of -- in
very similar conditions to those in the Ohio State
penitentiary. And there we have adopted a much less
formal process even than the one that Ohio does, and we
believe that is also constitutionally sufficient.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is -- is the population
with respect to which you have adopted the far more
lenient process a -- the population of the control unit,
which I understand is comparable to the unit we're talking
about in Ohio, or is it with respect to the general
maximum security population which is housed in conditions
less onerous than the control unit?
MS. MAYNARD: It is -- applies to the general
conditions in ADX -- the general populations in ADX
Florence and USP Marion.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, and --
MS. MAYNARD: But those conditions, Your Honor,
are similar to the Ohio State penitentiary. The
difference between -- may I finish, Justice -- Mr. Chief
Justice?
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes.
MS. MAYNARD: The -- the difference in the
general population, the prisoners are out 10 to 12 hours a
week for recreation, and in the control unit, they are out
hours a week.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.
Maynard.
Mr. Lobel, we'll hear from you.
Would you tell us what happened in Mr. Austin's
case? I mean, did he get a notice and that sort of thing?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULES LOBEL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LOBEL: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. May -- Mr.
Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
In many of the cases -- and I -- I will try to
-- in Mr. Austin's case and many of the other cases,
people didn't get a notice. I'd like to try to explain
what they get and what they don't get.
First, they do not get a final decision which
gives them reasons.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, could you answer
my question first? What kind of notice, if any, did Mr.
Austin get?
MR. LOBEL: I think Mr. Austin got no notice.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Perhaps you can take us
through this chronologically. You -- you began at the
end.
MR. LOBEL: Okay. The notice they get at the
beginning is an -- a notice which sometimes includes the
reasons, sometimes it doesn't include the reasons. What
the requirement in this policy is and what was found at
trial was that often they would get very vague reasons
like you're a gang member or a gang leader. Now --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then can you just explain that?
Because the policy says that he shall get notice and
attached to the notice will be a committee report. Then
they have a copy of the form that the report is supposed
to fill out on page 58 to about page 78 and it's about the
most detailed thing I've ever seen. So --
MR. LOBEL: Yes, that they don't get. That they
do not get.
JUSTICE BREYER: Even though -- you mean even
though it says that the policy says you should be noticed
and you're -- it says, attached to the notice will be a
copy of the -- I'm sorry. I'm looking -- am I looking at
the wrong place?
MR. LOBEL: I think you're reading in the wrong
place. But it -- there -- they do attach something, but
it's not that long form. That long form is what was never
given to the prisoners which would tell them what it is
that they were said to have done.
For example, if --
JUSTICE SOUTER: May I -- may I -- I just want
to make sure. There is then a direct disagreement of fact
between you and the Attorney General. I understood him to
say they got the form that starts at JA-58, and I
understand you to be saying they don't.
MR. LOBEL: They do not. The form that starts
at JA-58 they get, but the form that starts at JA-58 is
only one page. It's JA-58. They get that form. That
form says you'll tell them the reasons.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
MR. LOBEL: So at this -- at -- at -- during the
trial, often they didn't get the -- they didn't get any
notice.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. LOBEL: But now they should get a notice.
It should tell them some reason.
The problem at trial was that --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You mean a trial
before all the -- before they were about to be committed
or the hearing at which it was determined whether they
would be or not?
MR. LOBEL: At the hearing and -- they got a
notice. The notice said you're a gang leader. How is a
man supposed to respond to a vague notice that I'm a gang
leader when he doesn't know what it is that they are
saying is their -- is the reason that he's a gang leader?
All he could say -- this isn't like a trial. It's not a
trial-type procedure. What happens in reality --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, do you think it should
MR. LOBEL: No.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, this is a prison
classification, for goodness sakes.
MR. LOBEL: No. We're not --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: He's been found guilty and
sentenced to prison.
MR. LOBEL: Right, and we're not --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The question is what
procedures are required. And we've given a lot of
discretion in prison administration.
MR. LOBEL: And -- and we are not asking for
trial-type procedures. All we're asking for is very
minimal due process, which is that the person comes before
a committee of three correction officials, and they say,
what do you have to say for yourself? They don't present
any evidence. They don't present witnesses. They say,
you're a gang leader. What do you have to say for
yourself?
JUSTICE BREYER: Here is the exact words I -- I
think. It's -- tell me. This certainly seems to be
right. The inmate shall be served with notice at least 48
hours prior to the commencement of a hearing. The notice
shall include all of the reasons for the proposed
placement --
MR. LOBEL: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and a summary of the
evidence relied on. Now, I'm just reading that. What is
it I'm reading?
MR. LOBEL: That's -- that's the district
court's order. That's not what they -- that's the revised
policy under the district court's order.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Where is -- where
is --
MR. LOBEL: Where is theirs?
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. You go ahead.
MR. LOBEL: Their policy is, I believe, on page
JA-23. That tells you what they -- they say. He is to be
served with a notice of hearing form 48 hours prior to the
hearing.
That will -- that -- there were problems with
this. One is very vague notice. You're a gang leader.
They have evidence for why he's a gang leader. In Mr.
Roe's case, who's one of the plaintiffs, the evidence
which -- which was never told to the prisoner -- the
committee didn't even know the evidence. The evidence was
that he was hit over the head with a spatula while he was
waiting on line at the maximum security lunch line, and he
went to the hospital, and he never fought back. And from
this, somebody determined that he was a gang leader
because the people who were being targeted at that time
were gang leaders.
Now, if you take a man and say, come before a
committee, we're not going to tell you what this is about,
just that you're a gang leader, what do you have say for
yourself --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, what's -- what's
wrong with that?
MR. LOBEL: Because --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I mean, if he can --
if he's not a gang leader, he can tell them why he isn't.
MR. LOBEL: He'll say I'm not a gang leader.
But if they know and the reason is because he was involved
in this fight, which -- in which he didn't fight back, he
should be able to then say, well, this guy -- you're
wrong. This guy beat me up because I insulted him, or
he's been an enemy of mine. He has something to respond.
Otherwise, he can just say I'm not a gang leader.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You -- you want a
trial-type proceeding.
MR. LOBEL: This is a far cry from a trial. A
trial -- the State would have to put on witnesses. They'd
have to prove something. All you're doing here is saying
to the man, we're going to give you an opportunity to
respond. And the question is, do you have to give them
notice detailed enough? And that's all the district court
required was some summary so that it's detailed enough so
that he can respond. And really, all they have to do is
take that form that they print up, Justice Breyer, which
you were looking at, that long form, and copy it and
append it to the notice.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there is -- isn't there
the problem -- at least Ohio suggested that there is --
that if this person is indeed a gang leader and the form
says so-and-so and so-and-so effectively ratted on you,
those persons who came forward might not live to see
another day?
MR. LOBEL: And the district court ordered what
Ohio does in all its disciplinary proceedings, what the
Federal Government does in its disciplinary proceedings,
which is if it's confidential information, you don't have
to turn it over because they understand that, Justice
Ginsburg. The district court understood that.
But in Mr. Roe's case, it wasn't confidential
that he was hit over the head. Or in Mr. Thompson's case,
it wasn't confidential that they said to him, you were
present at some fight and they didn't tell who he was
fighting and they never were -- they never gave him any of
the -- the details so -- to be able to respond.
If it's confidential, they don't have to turn it
over. The district court --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But was -- was this under the
old policy that you're talking about what occurred?
MR. LOBEL: Yes, Your Honor. It was under --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. And I thought that we
had to address this facial challenge insofar as it affects
the new policy. And if the State complied with the new
policy, what is your complaint with that?
MR. LOBEL: The -- the new policy, which really
was in all honesty, Your Honor, a tweaked policy or a
modified policy -- they took the old policy and they made
some changes to it. The question before the Court is
whether that new policy fixed the problems. We saw the
problems --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which was never -- never in
effect, right? The new policy --
MR. LOBEL: Never went into effect.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So all -- the evidence
relates to the old policy which I think Ohio recognizes
was not adequate. And then there's -- Ohio has this new
policy, and you, just on the basis of the written
statement of the policy, made the judgment that it's not
good enough.
MR. LOBEL: It doesn't on -- just on the face of
it, it doesn't fix the problem that the district court
found. Vague notice. The other thing they would do is
they would give the person notice of one reason --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let -- you keep talking
about what happened in the past, and I'm -- I find some
difficulty with that because we're being asked to review a
new policy. And I would like you to look at the new
policy, show us where to find it in the record, and tell
us specifically what's wrong with it.
MR. LOBEL: I'll give you a very specific --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could -- could you refer to
something?
MR. LOBEL: Page -- look at page 22 and -- 23
and 33 of the new policy. Look at 23.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Where -- where is that?
MR. LOBEL: JA-23. Look at JA-23 and look at
JA-33.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. I'm on 23. What
are we --
MR. LOBEL: On 23, you look at the final
decision-maker -- the Bureau of Classification -- the
bottom line of the next-to-the-last paragraph -- will
review the recommendation and any objections filed and
make a final decision.
Now, here's what was happening, and I --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Is this happening
under the new policy?
MR. LOBEL: That's the new policy.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But now, you just were
going to say here's what was happening. Do you mean under
the new policy?
MR. LOBEL: No. The question is whether this
page 23 fixes what was happening in the past. This is
their new policy.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, why -- why is
that the question? If the new policy meets constitutional
standards, why does it have to fix something else?
MR. LOBEL: Your Honor, it doesn't meet
constitutional standards because it only says the chief
has to make a final decision. The chief doesn't have to
give any reasons for it, and I don't know of any case in
this Court in predictive decisions, in punitive decisions
where a -- a decision-maker can send somebody to solitary
confinement long-term. And Justice Souter, it's for at
least 2 years. Over 200 people there were for more than 3
years, which was really the -- the -- only limited by how
long the building was open -- and say, I'm putting you in
there and I'm not telling you why. And this policy lets
them do it, and that's what they were doing.
And there's nothing in this policy to change
that. And what was happening --
JUSTICE BREYER: So I think I've got your point.
Tell me if I -- I mean, I've now looked at -- this is very
confusing to me. I'm sure it's my fault. But I take it,
if you look at page 22, that's the new policy.
MR. LOBEL: Exactly.
JUSTICE BREYER: And what the new policy says
is, committee, you must give the prisoner some
information. Then it refers to form 2598. Form 2598 is
the form on page 58.
MR. LOBEL: Exactly.
JUSTICE BREYER: What that tells him is nothing
about the facts. That tells him he's been charged.
Period.
MR. LOBEL: He's been charged for being a gang
leader.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the new policy goes on to
say, the classification committee shall document
information presented by staff and the inmate which is
form 2627 and 2628. And I don't know where 2698 fits in,
but 2698 are all those pages with the information.
MR. LOBEL: And they don't have to give that to
anybody.
JUSTICE BREYER: And it just doesn't say
anything about them at all.
MR. LOBEL: And all the district court was
saying --
JUSTICE BREYER: So your point is in the past,
they didn't give them the information.
MR. LOBEL: They didn't give them the
information.
JUSTICE BREYER: Then they promulgated a new
policy and the new policy says nothing about it.
MR. LOBEL: Exactly. And that is why it's
facially invalid. But if you look at what was happening,
you could --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But form 58 -- I'm -- I'm
looking at page 58 -- says that the prisoner will be given
this form that says you were referred to the
classification committee for the following reasons. And
that leaves space to be filled out. What's the matter
with that?
MR. LOBEL: And -- two problems with that. It
could either say you're a gang leader, and second, it
could say which --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: This is a facial attack.
What in the world is the matter with that, saying you were
referred for the following reasons and leaving space to
have it filled out? Is that defective under the Due
Process Clause?
MR. LOBEL: Because you -- at trial we showed
what the practice was.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You showed what happened in
the past.
MR. LOBEL: And the question is, does this fix
it? And what happened in the past was they gave, for
example, a prisoner, and it said, here are the reasons.
The reason is you stabbed somebody. The committee said,
you stabbed somebody. It wasn't very bad. We recommend
that you not be put in the place. In over 50 percent of
the cases of those committee recommendations on retention,
the chief rendered a decision, without giving a final --
any real reasons, and used evidence and reasons which were
never given to the inmate.
In Ohio's brief, they say we could still do
that. We only have to give them some reason. For
example, we have to say you're a gang member. If it turns
out that you're -- turns out you're not a gang member, the
chief can say later on, well, you were dealing drugs.
That's -- that's not adequate. Facially it's not adequate
to give the person some reason and then switch the reason
in the middle of the game. And that's what was happening.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I can understand that
you could come on behalf of a prisoner on an as-applied
challenge, but to look at this form and tell us it is
facially invalid is difficult for me to understand. If --
if there are specific incidents where something was
defective, then challenge it, but what's the matter with
the form?
MR. LOBEL: Well -- well, the first thing that's
matter with the form is it doesn't require reasons for the
decision.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It's --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, why does the Due
Process Clause require reasons?
MR. LOBEL: Even in Salerno, the -- the -- this
Court held that in a preventive case, the bail -- the bail
reform statute still requires, as a basic modicum of due
process, that you give the person the reason --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: That -- that was a
statute.
MR. LOBEL: That was a statute, and the Court
relied on that for why the statute was constitutional.
Even in Greenholtz, the parole case, the -- this
Court said over and over again that in the -- in the
parole decision, which is much more predictive than here,
the parole board gave its reasons for why it --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: This form says, state the
reasons, and leaves blank space to do that.
MR. LOBEL: But that's --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So what's the matter?
MR. LOBEL: That's in the notice. It's not in
-- it's not in the decision.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what it says about --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it seems to me that the
-- the facial attack objection would -- would not be --
carry much weight if what happened was this. There was a
trial. The policies were found deficient, and the court
said, you devise some new forms. At that point, it seems
to me that the facial attack would -- objection would --
would not be relevant. And -- and your point would be
right. You say, you know, they -- they haven't -- this
doesn't -- is not going to cure the -- the deficiency.
But what happened here was that, as I understand
it, midway in the litigation there was a new policy, and
it -- it seems -- so we have sort of a moving target that
we're working with.
MR. LOBEL: Yes. Your Honor, it depends --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you comment on that?
MR. LOBEL: It depends on what you mean by
midway. On the eve of trial, as we approached the trial
court for trial, they promulgated the new policy which was
not supposed to be implemented until several months after
trial. And it seems in that situation perfectly
reasonable for a district court to say, here are the
problems that I've uncovered. I'm going to look at the
new policy and see if this new policy fixes it.
The -- the problems were not moot, Justice
O'Connor. These were ongoing problems. There were 200
prisoners who were there under a deficient policy. The
question then was, were they entitled to something better?
And did this new policy give them something better?
And the -- the district court found, I think
quite correctly, that it gave them a little better. It
was tweaked. It was modified. But on some of the basic
questions of whether or not you can bait and switch the
reasons, whether you could tell somebody you're in here
for drugs and then the classification chief could -- could
put him in for something else, or whether you had to give
them some reason that he can respond to -- in a situation
where you're not having a trial, Mr. Chief Justice, where
-- where the State does not have to come forward with any
evidence. The only evidence the person is getting of what
is his problem is this notice.
And the question is, when that is the only
evidence -- it's not like a trial like in the Federal
courts where you have to present witnesses, you have to
meet a standard of proof. It's not even in the -- like a
disciplinary trial where you have to meet a certain
standard of proof and present witnesses. The committee
sits there. The guy comes in and they say to him, tell us
why you're not a gang leader. And he says, well, tell me
why you think I am a gang leader. And they should be
forced to tell him that.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, what's wrong
with giving him the opportunity to say why he's not a gang
leader?
MR. LOBEL: How is Mr. Roe going to say I'm not
a gang leader because I wasn't hit over the head with a
spatula because I'm a gang leader, I was hit over the head
with a spatula because the guy doesn't like me, unless he
knows that that's why they think he is a gang leader? How
could he respond to that? All he could say is I don't
know what you're talking about.
JUSTICE BREYER: But why can't you do that in an
as-applied challenge? I mean, it may be that there was
all this -- suppose we wrote an opinion hypothetically.
Suppose -- and it said, look, I've read through this new
policy. I assume it will be administered in accordance
with the elements of due process, the basic elements being
some kind of notice basically what -- what the factual
part is, some kind of opportunity to present proofs in
evidence that's a reasonable one, and some kind of
decision by a neutral decision-maker.
Certainly the language of the new policy permits
such an interpretation. It doesn't -- and -- and suppose
we were to say, well, we assume it will have the basic
elements, and it's so complex, so detailed that -- that if
they don't, then the individual who suffers could bring a
claim and say it was administered unfairly in my case.
MR. LOBEL: Your Honor, I think as a facial
matter, when you're putting somebody in long-term solitary
confinement for years and years in a small cell with no
possibility of parole, you're -- I think you should give
them notice of the reasons in sufficient --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not disagreeing with
you.
MR. LOBEL: -- in sufficient detail.
JUSTICE BREYER: But you see -- yes. I'm -- I'm
not disagreeing with you. I'm saying I read their new
policy, now having gotten to it the third time through all
this detail, and it seems to me that they do give a
notice, and Justice O'Connor just pointed out where
there's a place for reasons. And as I read what happens
after the committee decides, it says, it shall make a
decision -- a recommendation accordingly -- according to
this very long, detailed form.
MR. LOBEL: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: And it doesn't say they won't
tell the prisoner. It doesn't say whether they'll tell
the prisoner.
MR. LOBEL: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: So why can't I assume they will
tell him so he'll know what's going on? And then if they
don't, you'd have an as-applied challenge.
MR. LOBEL: Even if, as an abstract matter, you
could assume it, when you've had a 1-week trial with
witness after witness, and the witnesses say they're not
doing this --
JUSTICE BREYER: That was before the new policy.
MR. LOBEL: But the new policy is introduced at
trial. And the -- the question is -- really what you're
saying, Justice Breyer, is the mere introduction of the
new policy renders the whole case -- case moot.
JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm now saying is I can
understand exactly why you might feel the way you do. But
our job is to not necessarily take that feeling. But
shouldn't we presume that the State will administer words
that comport with the basic elements, not every detail as
you want, but they will administer this new policy in
accord with those basic elements of fairness? Isn't that
giving a -- sort of like a deference to the State, which
maybe we should?
MR. LOBEL: Maybe you should in an ordinary
case. Where there's been a trial and it's a clear pattern
and practice that they're not, then I think that Friends
of the Earth v. Laidlaw says that you have to show that
the new policy is going to cure the problems.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you -- are you saying that
what we have before us is this, a trial which showed that
the pre-new policy procedures were deficient and the trial
judge and you and a court of appeals interpreted the new
policies as remedies for past wrongs that were
established? And the question is the adequacy of that
remedy. That's one way to look at the case.
MR. LOBEL: That's certainly one way.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Another way to look at the
case is to say that Ohio admitted that there were some
improprieties, showed its new policy, and the case turned
on the adequacy of the new policies. Now, those are two
different things. Which is this case?
MR. LOBEL: But to look at it the second way,
you have to show that the problems proved at trial were
moot. If the problems are ongoing, then the plaintiffs
are entitled to a remedy. You can't say that there are
problems that are ongoing, which there were -- they were
all --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But how can you know
whether the problems are ongoing if the new rules haven't
been implemented?
MR. LOBEL: Well, they are ongoing at trial.
When the trial judge renders his decision, they're
ongoing. The question then is looking at this abstractly,
it's not a question of in the abstract is it okay, but in
the abstract will it cure the problems.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Why -- why isn't it a
question of as facially in the abstract is it okay?
MR. LOBEL: Yes. Well, as I said, facially in
the abstract, I think it's not okay because I think they
should have final decision with reasons and notice with
sufficient detail for reasons.
But even if you don't agree with me on that, I
think that this case, when you have an -- when you have a
trial and there's a pattern and practice of -- of
problems, I don't think that it's proper to simply assume
that a piece of paper which says we'll give reasons is
adequate when the reasons that they're giving and that the
trial shows they're giving are inadequate. They're vague.
They're -- they're shifting the ball on people. And I --
and I think --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, Mr.
Lobel? Putting aside for a second which policy we look at
and so forth, were there findings that particular inmates
were improperly sent to this facility?
MR. LOBEL: There -- there were findings that --
that there were -- particular inmates who were improperly
-- were sent with no evidence against them.
JUSTICE STEVENS: All right, and was there any
-- any order saying that inmate should get out and go to a
different facility?
MR. LOBEL: No. The district court simply
ordered that since there was a widespread showing of
arbitrary and capricious placement and -- and that there
was a showing that they built the prison for 500 -- with
0 cells and they didn't need 500 cells and they were
putting people in there who didn't need -- who didn't meet
the criteria that they set forward -- there was a
widespread showing of that. The district court said you
should give them new hearings following a procedure which
would be sufficient to meet the constitutional Due Process
Clause.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And so the State then came
back and said we're putting in this new policy, we will
give them new hearings under the new policy?
MR. LOBEL: No. The -- the State never
implemented the new policy. The court said what you
should do is give them hearings, which give them notice
sufficient to explain what's going on, render a final
decision which explains what's going on, give them a
chance to produce witnesses if they have a -- if they have
witnesses, and they gave them hearings --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So that even though -- if I
understand it correctly, even though there had findings
that some inmates have been improperly -- had had
inadequate procedure as a predicate to going into the new
facility, they can just stay there until the litigation is
over.
MR. LOBEL: That's right because the district
court didn't move any particular prisoner. But what
happened was when you --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Where do -- where do
we find those findings? Where in the record do we find
the findings about individual people?
MR. LOBEL: They're -- they're all through the
district court's opinion. If you want to look at Mr. Roe,
it's at 73 to 76. Mr. Thompson is at 77 to 79. All of
these were cases where the district court found people are
being put in here on no evidence or essentially no
evidence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And as -- and as to those
prisoners, was there a requirement that the -- that the
court's procedures be made applicable and so there would
have to be a retroactive hearing as to those prisoners?
MR. LOBEL: For all the prisoners. Several --
several months later, there were new hearings. And what
happened then was that the amount of prisoners at this
prison went from 330 to where it is right now, which is
, the same in the Federal control -- as in the Federal
control unit.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can you just give me 1 minute
on the other issue?
MR. LOBEL: We're talking about 48 prisoners.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell us on -- on the
liberty interest where we started with the --
MR. LOBEL: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- with the Attorney General,
is there a liberty interest in not being transferred from
prison 1 -- level 1 to level 2 --
MR. LOBEL: No.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- level 2, that sort of
thing?
Why is it that there's a liberty interest in
being transferred -- I guess being transferred from 4 to
MR. LOBEL: We argued here that this was an
atypical, significant hardship compared not to level 1, 2,
, or 4, but compared to the segregation units, any other
prison in Ohio, even the segregation units, and for three
reasons, all of which in combination the court of -- the
district court held required a finding of liberty
interest.
One, it's long-term, indefinite. There were
over 200 people here who were there for almost as long as
the building was open, and there was no reason to believe
that they were ever going to get out. It was indefinite.
That's very different than Sandin's 30-day disciplinary
confinement.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought there -- there was at
least annual review. Isn't -- wasn't there an annual --
MR. LOBEL: There was an annual review, but the
committee that they set up to review it, made up not of
law professors, but made up of correctional officials,
said --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And a good thing too.
(Laughter.)
MR. LOBEL: And a good thing, I agree. I would
-- I would hate to be doing this.
But made up of wardens and deputy wardens, said
Mr. Roe, there's no reason you should be here, you should
get out. And then based on reasons and evidence, which
Mr. Roe never knew, which the committee never knew -- the
committee thought Mr. Roe was in there for one reason, and
it turned out on trial he was in there for another reason.
The classification chief says to him -- says, you're going
to stay here another year.
Mr. Roe goes back, has a perfect record, does
every program he can do. He comes back to the committee.
The committee says, Mr. Roe, you should get out of here
again. And the classification chief again says, I'm
sorry, for no reason I'm just going to keep you here. And
at that point you say, well, Mr. Roe, you may be here for
the rest of your life, and there's no -- this is not
definite like in the control unit where --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What does the new policy say
about this?
MR. LOBEL: Nothing.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Nothing about --
MR. LOBEL: Nothing.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- about the annual review.
MR. LOBEL: It says you get an annual review.
They got an annual review. The new policy doesn't say.
And what the district court ordered was
draconian, that the classification chief, after he does
this, without hearing from the inmate, without giving him
reasons, has to write a final decision, which gives him
some of the reasons that Mr. Roe is being kept there, and
that they have to tell him, like they told the prisoners
in -- in Greenholtz, what you have to do to get out. What
-- and that doesn't seem to me unreasonable. And all you
have to do is give a one-paragraph reason. Now, that's
the first reason, but that's not the only reason.
The State officials testified that this was
qualitatively different than any other prisoner, that the
level of restriction, the no outdoor recreation for many
years, that people have not been outside for years, the
small cell with solid steel doors so that they could not
hardly talk to anybody or see anybody, that these were
conditions --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did they have reading
materials? I --
MR. LOBEL: They had reading materials, yes,
Your Honor, and they had televisions so they could watch
their favorite programs.
But they had nobody to talk to. And we -- the
experiment that was done with long-term solitary
confinement, which this Court itself in the 1890's found
caused people to go crazy -- if you have to give people
the process that was required here to send the prisoner to
a mental institution, you should have to give them at
least that process to send them into a situation which is
going to send them to the mental institution.
(Laughter.)
MR. LOBEL: And that's what's involved here.
It's a qualitatively different type of experience. And
the Seventh Circuit in U.S. v. Johnson said you cannot
sentence somebody to -- into solitary confinement for the
term of their sentence because it's a qualitatively
different type of experience. It's not the 30 days in
Sandin. It's not the 7 weeks in Ewing. This is
qualitatively different.
And to top it off, the third reason is because
these people were automatically deemed ineligible for
parole. And Justice Scalia, in Sandin, the Court said in
this case it's not -- the -- the prisoner isn't being
denied parole. Well, here we have evidence that there are
prisoners who were -- the parole board said we will
release you on parole. All you have to do is get out of
the supermax. The committee says -- a correctional
officials says, you're ready to go.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the whole class,
though.
MR. LOBEL: Not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You have a class action. It's
just a few of them. In fact, there's -- there's no more
parole in Ohio, as I understand it.
MR. LOBEL: Yes, but a -- the vast -- I believe
it's over 90 percent of the people who were in this prison
were sentenced under the old rules, under the old parole
rules. And in addition, every prisoner who got sent to
this prison was delayed parole for the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10
years that they were going to spend at this prison. So
every prisoner it affected.
Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: General Petro, you
have 3 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. PETRO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PETRO: Thank you, Your Honor.
It has been pointed out that -- that inmates
stay in the prison for many years, but in reality, over
0 inmates since the opening of -- of Ohio State
penitentiary in 1998 -- over 600 inmates have gone into
level 5 and over 550 inmates have left level 5. And so
the classification process is an ongoing process.
It is now established under an order of the
district court, but we submit, Your Honors, that the new
policy that was presented in 2002 at the time this case
was pending trial, was a policy that provided a process
which was the best type of process for a predictive
decision. This Court has often deferred to the decision-
making of -- of prison officials in seeking to protect the
safety and security of the prison.
And in this instance, the policy that was put in
place and the hearing process, without actually having
essentially a fact-finding process, which is what the
court has imposed on this process, was the kind of process
that allows for prison officials to review a whole variety
of additional information even beyond what might be
evidentiary.
When we think about the conditions in the prison
where the inmate is currently housed, if they're at the
Lucasville penitentiary in level 4 -- and the conditions
there are particularly volatile -- the prison officials
need to have the flexibility to make a decision on
placement in level 5 not only to protect this inmate but
to protect the institution itself and the safety of the
inmates and the safety, of course, of -- of the personnel
that work at the facility.
In the Mathews test, which was applied both by
the district court and by the court of appeals, there is
clearly an acknowledgement that the interest of the
government is very strong. But in the second step of the
Mathews test, there's a recognition that additional
procedures really add no value to the decision-making
process.
Here the -- the government needs to have the
capacity and the -- the ability to make the best possible
decision looking at a whole variety of factors, and to
have a procedure put in place by the court that requires a
full display of all the evidence that will be presented at
the time of hearing, as incorporated in the notice to the
inmate that a hearing will be held, and then an
acknowledgement that there's -- only this evidence is the
evidence that -- that is being relied upon really presents
essentially a fact-finding hearing where the hearing
process that is set forth in New Policy 111-07 is more
than just fact-finding. It's kind of an analysis. It
gets an opportunity -- provides an opportunity to really
assess the attitude of the inmate, the -- the risks that
are involved in -- in placement in a -- in a different
level in a different penitentiary. It is directed at
protecting the safety and the security of the inmates and,
obviously, of protecting the -- the safety of the
personnel. And it is fully consistent with this Court's
precedents.
In applying the Mathews test --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General
Petro.
MR. PETRO: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The case is submitted.
