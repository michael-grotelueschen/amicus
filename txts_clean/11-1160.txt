CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 11-1160, the Federal Trade
Commission v. Phoebe Putney Health System.
Mr. Horwich?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HORWICH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The State Action Doctrine provides a defense
to a Federal antitrust suit when a State has clearly
articulated and affirmatively expressed an intent to
displace competition with respect to the particular
activity at issue in the suit.
Now, in practical terms, what that comes
down to is whether application of Federal competition
law would somehow subvert a sovereign State policy
choice that's clearly evident in State law.
Now, that policy might be expressed in
mandatory or compulsory terms, but, short of that, it
would also be enough, if the -- the State had
specifically permitted conduct that is inherently
anticompetitive.
But a grant of general power to act --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't think that the
grant of powers in this case would permit the hospital
authorities, the corporation, to set prices for their
services that are below the competitive prices in order
to serve the needy?
MR. HORWICH: Well, Justice --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that inherent in
the regulations?
MR. HORWICH: I think it is, although for
reasons that don't affect the analysis of the question
about an anticompetitive acquisition. And let me
explain why the analysis might be different with respect
to prices.
There is specific authorization in the
statute for the hospital authorities, in conjunction
with the counties, to partly fund -- or, I guess,
entirely, in principle -- fund their services through
tax revenues. So they have another source of funding
that would allow them to price in ways that a
competitive actor would not necessarily price its
services.
So if we're talking about particular pricing
decisions, say -- I guess it would be below cost pricing
that is alleged to somehow be anticompetitive -- then
there might very well be a State action defense to that
because it -- because the State -- the power to price
services subsidized in a way that an ordinary actor
wouldn't be able to do --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have --
MR. HORWICH: -- might very well displace
competition in that regard.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any cases in
which we -- we slice it that fine --
MR. HORWICH: Well, I do think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that -- that you are a
State actor for some anticompetitive purposes and not
for others?
MR. HORWICH: Yeah, absolutely,
Justice Scalia. I think -- I think the best -- the best
example comes from Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar. So,
in that case, the -- the issue was a challenge to a
practice of minimum fee schedules that were set by --
not by the State, but -- but agreed upon by a bar
organization.
Now, the State in that case, of course,
regulated the practice of law. It regulated admission
into the practice of law. It regulated certain aspects
of the conduct of the practice of law. And this Court
held, in Bates v. Arizona State Bar, that those sort of
regulations do constitute State action.
But the Court did not accept the submission
that the State action defense covered the setting of
minimum prices that was at issue in that case because
that was not something that there was State action over.
And as a -- and, taking a step back, the
justification for the State Action Doctrine is that the
State is trying to pursue some policy that is part of
its traditional sovereign prerogatives to regulate its
own economy and that Federal law was not understood to
intrude upon that.
But, if the State is not actually trying to
advance some other policy, with respect to the
particular conduct at issue, then it can't be said that
the State has done something that Federal law should
stand aside for.
The -- the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Horwich, you said
in -- in your reply brief that, if the Hospital
Authorities Law specifically authorized local hospital
authorities to acquire any and all hospitals within
their geographic area, then the clear articulation
requirement would be satisfied.
But the Authorities Law does authorize the
acquisition of other hospitals. And it doesn't say one
or two; it says other -- other facilities.
So why doesn't the hospital laws law do
exactly what you said would satisfy the -- the clear
articulation requirement?
MR. HORWICH: Well, I think the key
difference there, Justice Ginsburg, between the
hypothetical we offered in the -- the reply brief and
the statute here is that the -- the additional words
"any and all" make it clear that the State is
contemplating that there could -- the county might opt
for socializing its hospital services, putting all of
them under the control of the hospital authority.
And, by contrast, what we have here is an
ordinary corporate power to acquire property. And, like
all of the ordinary corporate powers that the authority
possesses that are -- that resemble those that -- that
an ordinary business corporation would have, the most
natural understanding of them is that the State expects
them to be exercised in conformity with the background
principles that -- that bind everybody. So --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just so I understand
your answer to Justice Ginsburg, you're saying there
would be a difference if the charter said the authority
may require -- acquire any properties to fulfill its
mission and if it said the authority may acquire
properties to promote its mission?
MR. HORWICH: Well, I think it's probably in
our -- the hypothetical offered in our reply brief, it's
probably the "all" -- the "any and all" that -- that
would, I think, be what communicates the State's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think a
general saying they may acquire properties doesn't
implicitly say they may acquire all properties?
That seems a pretty thin --
MR. HORWICH: No, I don't think it does --
well -- but I think, in this area, it's -- it's
important, for a couple reasons, that we actually
have -- have some substantial assurance of what the
State is trying to do here.
And a power to grant proper -- excuse me --
a power to acquire properties, generally speaking,
unadorned with any particular expression from the State
about how -- how that power is to be used, is -- is
something that can be used competitively or
anticompetitively.
And you can't infer from that that the State
really has an objective of, as I say, such as
socializing its hospital services because -- and -- and
it's -- and that clarity of expression from the State is
really important here, for several reasons.
First of all, this is an odd rule, to begin
with, in that it allows State law to displace Federal
law. So we would want some clarity from --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume -- I assume that
the normal corporate charter contains such a provision,
the authority to acquire property, right?
MR. HORWICH: Yeah, it absolutely does.
And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And we don't -- that --
that charter is issued by the State, right?
MR. HORWICH: It is issued by the State.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And we don't -- we don't
think that that enables all corporations to ignore the
Sherman Act, do we?
MR. HORWICH: No, we don't. And we don't
generally think that those corporate powers express an
intent to displace any other background --
if I could give some examples, maybe we could look at
some --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Horwich, could I just --
MR. HORWICH: Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- before you give examples,
just make sure I understand your basic position?
Suppose the State had said, very clearly,
that these hospital authorities had the power to engage
in acquisitions of hospitals that, for a normal actor,
would violate the antitrust laws, but -- but basically
said the -- the hospital authorities had the discretion
to do that or not.
And the State didn't know the hospital
authority might do it, but it also might not do it.
That would be subject to the immunity; is that correct?
MR. HORWICH: I -- I think the defense would
be available if -- if the beginning of your hypothetical
was kind of quoting the statute, yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. It's a clear grant of
authority --
MR. HORWICH: Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But the authority is
completely discretionary. So the State is basically
saying, we don't know, we're going to let the hospital
authority figure it out.
MR. HORWICH: Well, it's certainly -- the
hospital authority can figure it -- figure out, but what
it's figuring out is whether to actually invoke a
displacement of competition that the State has expressly
put on the table. And that's what is different in this
case --
JUSTICE KAGAN: What -- but what I'm trying
to get at is the State has put it on the table only as a
completely discretionary action. The State has not
expressed a preference for it.
The State has only said that the hospital
authority can think about conditions on the ground in
its particular locality and can decide whether such an
anticompetitive acquisition is appropriate.
MR. HORWICH: Yes, that's fine. We don't
have any quarrel with -- with States setting up a clear
set of tools, some of which, in your example, might
inherently displace competition --
JUSTICE KAGAN: So all of this language --
MR. HORWICH: -- and having it exercised,
actually, at a local level. That's fine.
JUSTICE KAGAN: So all this language in your
brief about necessarily and inherently and compelled,
all of those things really are not part of your -- your
governing test?
MR. HORWICH: No. I -- I disagree with
that. The reason they are part of our governing test is
this: Is that a State can certainly give a -- a menu of
specific options that sub-State entities can -- can
select from. And it might be that some of those are, in
fact, not anticompetitive.
Let me give you an example from -- from this
Court's cases. Southern Motor Carriers involved the
submission of -- by motor carriers, of their rates to a
public service commission that was -- that would accept
them as filed rates.
Now, the States -- some of the States there
said, well, you can file them individually, or you can
file them jointly, and we don't necessarily have a
preference, one way or the other, for it.
But the fact that the States had said you
can file them jointly, which is a horizontal agreement
among competitors and sure looks anticompetitive, the
fact that the State had said that and put that option on
the table qualified as a clear articulation from the
State that it intended the displacement of competition
to occur if that specific option was chosen.
The difference here is that, if you are
willing to say, in a case like what we have here with a
statute that -- that confers a -- a power that is
entirely neutral as to how it would be -- how it could
be exercised, you have the problem of not really knowing
what the State would intend. And so you can't say that
the State clearly intended that there be displacement
of competition --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the other?
The next line that they give is they give to the
hospital authority the power to acquire and operate
projects and the power to form and operate one or more
networks of hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare
providers.
Now, as I read that, it certainly includes
the rather specific power of acquiring a hospital. And
having read that -- not -- not just something you might
see in General Motors' charter.
MR. HORWICH: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and those -- that's
the language of the -- of the grant of power.
Now, I want to know what you want us to do
because, in my mind, reading this, it's a statute that
provides for regulation -- price regulation of
hospitals. And you say -- and I have no doubt you
thought of one way in which that could be -- I can think
of 100 -- that you could have prices that are different
from those set by a free market. So I have no doubt
that this sets -- I start there.
Now, what is it -- I go back to
Justice Scalia's original question: What is it you want
us to say? Even though this -- this statute is immune,
does grant immunity from attack on a basis of cost and
price regulation, it is not immune in respect to
mergers, okay?
MR. HORWICH: Well, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER: I can, unfortunately, think
of about 50 examples, where a merger might be
anticompetitive, and yet, it would lead to lower prices.
And the Department of Justice might attack it, but this
statute -- and that's what's bothering me -- seems to
want to further that kind of thing.
MR. HORWICH: Well, I --
JUSTICE BREYER: That -- that's where I am,
and I -- I'm not at all decided.
MR. HORWICH: Sure. Well, I guess I
would -- I guess I would first point out that -- that
price competition is not the be-all and end-all of
anticompetitive consequences, right?
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I think I know that.
MR. HORWICH: I mean, we have this
concern -- obviously, we have a concern here that
without -- and this is detailed, very clearly, in the
complaint, I mean, I think starting with paragraph --
paragraph 8, that talks about some of the price -- some
of the pricing constraints. But you get on to the later
paragraphs of the complaint, you have all these
descriptions of loss of quality competition here.
So you have -- you have --
JUSTICE BREYER: You are not understanding
my question, I guess. You have to take as a given that,
even though what you say is true, I would find that this
statute clearly prohibits the application of the
antitrust laws to pricing decisions. That's the job of
the authority.
Now, if I start with that, then you will
say, okay, I have to decide against you. Or you might
say, even so, I win because mergers are different. Now,
that -- that's what I'm trying to get you to say.
MR. HORWICH: Yes, and I guess that is what
I'm -- I guess that is what I'm trying to say, is that
mergers are different because the challenged
anticompetitive act here is not a pricing decision by
the hospitals that --
JUSTICE BREYER: I want to ask you: Why are
they different?
MR. HORWICH: They are different --
JUSTICE BREYER: After all, we have, one,
the specific language I read; and, two, I can think of
examples where a merger would be anticompetitive under
the DOJ and your FTC rules --
MR. HORWICH: Yeah.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and yet, probably would
further the purposes of the statute by lowering the
cost.
MR. HORWICH: Well, that's --
JUSTICE BREYER: Do you think that's the
null set? I -- I don't think that's --
MR. HORWICH: No, I -- well, I don't -- I
don't know whether that is -- I don't know whether that
is true or not, but I think -- I think we're relying on
a more -- I think you can't simply start with the idea
that, well -- well, you can't start with the premise
that this act exists to pursue an objective and to
pursue it at any cost, without regard to whether it
displaces competition in the market for paid healthcare
services, without regard to whether it displaces
competition for quality among these hospitals.
I mean, on that logic -- and I -- I think it
might help to look at some of the other powers here. If
we -- if you go to the back of the government's brief,
on page 6A, the authority has the power to make and --
and execute contracts. Well, I don't think that that
implies a privilege to enter price-fixing contracts.
That's part of the background principles of antitrust
law.
I also don't think it implies the power to
enter contracts against public policy. A State,
presumably, doesn't wish to abandon that background
principle, simply because it wants the authority to
pursue its mission.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've already
told us that there can be State action for some purposes
and not others.
MR. HORWICH: Exactly.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the fact that you
have examples where you might conclude, no, they didn't
mean to do that, doesn't seem to categorically suggest
that you prevail with respect to another one of the
powers that are granted.
MR. HORWICH: No, I agree with that, that it
doesn't categorically, but it does -- it does seem to me
that -- that if we're looking through this list of
powers that -- that the hospital authority has, there is
not anything meaningfully different about the power to
acquire -- acquire property versus make contracts
versus, as Justice Scalia said, any other powers that
are -- that exist in a general corporation's business
charter.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- this may be
completely wrong. You can tell me. I would -- would
doubt that, in counties or municipalities of this size,
you are going to have -- you know, five hospitals, and
so that a -- the authority could acquire a hospital and
yet still it not have any significant merger
consequences on its face.
In other words, when this law was passed,
giving them the power to acquire hospitals, wasn't it
the case that there would likely be only one other
hospital or two, so that any acquisition of another
hospital would have the merger consequences that this
one had?
MR. HORWICH: Well, no, because I think
the -- the baseline when the statute was enacted was
that the hospital authorities didn't even exist. So
they didn't own any hospitals.
And the first acquisition of a hospital
can't raise a competitive concern because it's not
concentrating the market in any way. It's simply
transferring ownership of the hospital from one actor to
another.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but to -- to follow
the Chief Justice's question, suppose it were shown that
there were many rural counties -- rural areas in
Georgia, very much like this one. Would that change
this case? I thought that was the purport of the -- the
thrust of the question.
MR. HORWICH: I think you'd have to imagine
a very stylized hypothetical, to see that the State had
clearly intended to displace competition. You would
want to see, for example -- let me give you an
example --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I know Georgia has
8 counties or something.
MR. HORWICH: Right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So I think they probably
have many rural areas with one or two hospitals. That's
just a guess.
MR. HORWICH: Well, right, but I suppose
that -- that guesswork is not going to be a basis
for saying a State has clearly intended to displace
competition.
The situation in which I think you might
recognize it is, if the hospital authorities were
already in existence, but they -- and they all each
owned a hospital, but they had never had the power to
acquire a hospital, and you knew that they were all --
that each of them had their neighboring competitor, and
then the legislature comes in and says -- you know,
we -- we would like you now to actually be able to
acquire -- acquire additional hospitals.
I mean, the power here is not the power to
acquire additional hospitals. But, if the legislature
had said, we have the power to acquire additional
hospitals and we know you already have one and we know
that the one you are going to acquire is going to be
your neighbor and we know there is not lots of hospitals
out there, then you might say that, yes, the -- the
clear implication of that is that that's going --
JUSTICE BREYER: What does the words mean,
"to form and operate one or more major networks of
hospitals"?
MR. HORWICH: Well, I think the networks --
JUSTICE BREYER: Which follow -- which
follow the words "to acquire and operate projects,
defined to include hospitals." So -- so what about
those words? Why aren't they good enough?
MR. HORWICH: Well, I guess I'm not sure
where Your Honor is looking. They -- they aren't
actually -- they don't follow themselves in the statute,
but --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm looking at
Section 30 -- well, where are we? 31-7-75(3).
MR. HORWICH: Right. And so I think what
you are referring to is number -- number 27 on the list.
And -- and I think, in the healthcare
industry, the idea of forming a network is not the idea
of socializing all of the available resources under
government control. A network is an integrated system
where you can go to the hospital for your emergency
care, and they can refer you to an outpatient clinic
that they have somewhere else, and there is a physician
who has an arrangement with both of those who can track
your care, and you can go acquire your durable medical
equipment from some -- from some store they operate.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tying.
MR. HORWICH: That's what a network is.
That's not vertical integration.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A network is tying
products, to tie products.
MR. HORWICH: Yes, that's exactly right.
That's a tying situation.
This is -- this is a merger within -- within
one relevant market. And -- and that's what's
different. So I don't think the 27 --
JUSTICE BREYER: And this falls within the
words "to acquire and operate projects"?
MR. HORWICH: It does. But so --
JUSTICE BREYER: And --
MR. HORWICH: It does, but there is nothing
about acquiring a project that is inherently -- that's
inherently anticompetitive. Acquisitions are not always
anticompetitive.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I guess that just
adds on to the issues that we have a price-fixing
mechanism, we have a tying mechanism that is expressed,
so what's left after that? Just this? Mergers and
acquisitions?
MR. HORWICH: Well, I -- well, no, I
think -- I think horizontal --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At -- at what point --
MR. HORWICH: -- generally horizontal
agreements, I think you -- so the contracting power
doesn't -- doesn't allow the hospital authority to go --
I don't think the -- the hospital here could any more
merge with Palmyra than it could go enter into a
contract with Palmyra that says, hey, we are going to --
you know, fix the prices that we --
JUSTICE BREYER: And can't -- in other
words, the -- the two hospitals in the town, when they
say, the price here -- you shall see that the price is
not higher than 38 cents, whatever, and would you please
get together and be certain that you have similar terms
and you have similar agreements and similar prices
there, we don't want either of you to be higher, that --
you would then proceed against them for that?
MR. HORWICH: Absolutely, Your Honor.
This -- this statute -- and take a step back --
JUSTICE BREYER: And would you also do the
same if -- if the electricity regulator in any State or
telephone -- a local telephone regulator --
MR. HORWICH: No, Your Honor. I think
that --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- or gas pipeline
regulator -- what they did is the same thing; they said,
our prices are -- you're to file tariffs, and the
tariffs are to be reached after you go meet in
committee; and that -- that would also fall within the
antitrust laws?
MR. HORWICH: No, I think those would likely
be very different.
I want to be clear about --
JUSTICE BREYER: How is that?
MR. HORWICH: -- the point. The point of
this law is to grant counties the opportunity to
participate in this market by providing care to
indigents.
This is not a law about public utility
regulation. If you think that this is a law about
public utility regulation, that all hospitals
are supposed to be -- that the State intends counties to
be able to elect to put all hospitals under their
control and -- and manage them as such and manage them
in the way that a -- that a public service commission
would regulate all of the utilities --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the language is
awfully similar to what you find in public utility
statutes, to set reasonable rates, to be certain that
nobody is higher than a reasonable rate.
MR. HORWICH: Well, this -- the authority
does not have the power to -- Justice Breyer, the
authority does not have the power to establish rates at
private hospitals. And that -- that would be a signal
difference between the -- the authority's power in
this -- in this case and the power of a public service
regulator over a -- over a utility.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what does it mean to
establish rates and charges for the services and use of
the facilities of the authority?
MR. HORWICH: The facilities of the
authority, yes, but not other hospitals within the
jurisdiction. It's only -- it's only the hospitals that
the authority itself is -- is operating.
And so -- so I guess we -- we also have
here -- I want -- I want to be clear that, in all of
this discussion, we are -- we are operating on the
premise that it's actually the authority itself that is
operating the hospital.
Of course, that is not what this case is.
The -- the hospital --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you define
"necessity," as you use it? I am harkening back to
Justice Kagan. We have plenty of cases that say you
don't need to find out whether the exemption is
necessary to make the program work.
MR. HORWICH: Right. No, we don't think it
means that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We don't make that
judgment.
MR. HORWICH: No, it's not a normative
judgment.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The State makes that
judgment. Exactly.
MR. HORWICH: Correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And, in your answer, you
conceded that whether -- if -- if there is discretion,
it's not necessary to make it work because the -- the
authority can say yes or no -- it's not --
MR. HORWICH: Exactly.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's your
definition of "necessity"?
MR. HORWICH: Our definition -- our
definition -- well, I have to be honest with you, it's
hard to define it because it's going to arise in a
number of different contexts.
But what this -- but the times where this
Court has used it, it has -- it has used it to convey
the idea that the choice that the State is offering is
no choice at all, if Federal law is going to come in;
that -- that Federal law would just negate the choice.
So to be concrete about this, in -- in
Hallie, for example, the choice that the State provided
at the end of kind of a complicated line of -- of
statutory rules about how -- how cities do or don't have
to provide their sewage treatments to -- to their
neighbors, at the end of the day the city had a choice
to say, fine, we will give you sewage treatment
services, but you have to be annexed to us and -- you
know, take the other things that come with annexation to
the city.
Now, if that choice is -- is -- if that
choice is anticompetitive, it's going to be taken away
by Federal law. And the choice that the State has tried
to offer is no choice at all. It's going to be negated,
and the only choice left for the -- the city in Hallie
is going to be to -- to opt --
JUSTICE ALITO: If the State --
MR. HORWICH: To just relent and get the
sewage treatment service --
JUSTICE ALITO: If a State legislature
articulates clearly and expresses affirmatively that it
wants municipalities to share the State's antitrust
immunity, is that sufficient? Or is there a degree of
specificity that's necessary as to the particular
anticompetitive conduct that the State wants to cover?
MR. HORWICH: Well, I think, in your
hypothetical, we are imagining kind of a municipality
enabling act that just has -- you know, a section in it
that says, municipalities shall enjoy the State's
exemption from the --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Georgia does seem to have such
a statute.
MR. HORWICH: Yes. So -- so that -- that's
not a clear articulation problem because it's plenty
clear what the State's trying to do.
There might be what I would call an
affirmative expression problem there because simply
saying that the State doesn't want the antitrust laws to
apply, that's not the basis in federalism for the -- for
the State Action Doctrine.
The basis in federalism is that the State
has made some affirmative choice that it wants to
accomplish something else, and that it's offered some
principle on which the sub-State actors can -- can act
to serve the State's policy interests.
And so I think you might have to hesitate in
a case like that to say, well, if the -- if the State is
just passing out indulgences to -- to get out of Federal
competition law, that may not be something that,
substantively, Federal law will stand aside for.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't want to take
up your rebuttal time, but I don't see how that's
consistent with your answer to Justice Kagan about a
grant of discretionary authority.
MR. HORWICH: Well, I -- I was assuming, in
Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that we had some of the
other things going on here that -- that manifested a
particular objective that the State was trying to
pursue.
So sort of the State trying to pursue
municipal governance doesn't seem to me to be enough of
an affirmative State policy to say that works. So I
think that would distinguish the two.
And if I could reserve? Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Waxman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In the specific area of local hospital
services, the Georgia legislature has adopted a model of
local public choice, including the choice to reduce or
eliminate competition.
There is no issue here, Justice Scalia, with
respect to your earlier question, of general corporate
powers. The Hospital Authorities Law creates local
public authorities to, quote, "exercise public and
essential government functions to provide hospital care
for residents, especially residents who cannot pay. It
empowers authorities to acquire projects" -- plural --
"specifically including each authority the ability to
acquire hospitals" -- plural -- but with limitations.
They have to -- it has to be within a very
confined geographic and demographic jurisdiction. And
for authority hospitals, it replaces any pure market
model with statutory mandates, a mandate to provide
services to all indigent in the community and to price
all services on a not-for-profit basis and with a
statutory limitation on rate of return.
There are --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I don't see how
any of that pertains to whether they can create a
hospital monopoly. You can do all of that, even though
you are not the only hospital in the area.
MR. WAXMAN: The -- I guess my point here is
that the -- that the legislature's -- the powers that
the -- the legislature has given hospital authorities
are not, by any means, general corporate powers. They
are broader than what a corporation may have in certain
respects and much narrower in other respects.
And they --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the only respect
relevant here is -- is -- the only respect relevant is
the ability to acquire other hospitals.
MR. WAXMAN: That's right. And there is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right? And that's -- and
that's a general corporate power. Every corporation in
Georgia has the power to acquire, including acquire
other businesses.
MR. WAXMAN: There -- there -- these --
these are -- the supervening wish, mandate, of the
legislature -- and this is well-explained in Georgia
Supreme Court cases, particularly DeJarnette, which was
decided right after Georgia amended its constitution,
enacted the Hospital Authorities Law -- was the desire
to -- the goal to provide adequate hospital services,
particularly for the indigent --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Georgia wasn't so sure
because didn't it come in originally on the side of the
FTC in this case?
MR. WAXMAN: It did. And Georgia's
complaint and its theory in the district court, which it
did not pursue in the court of appeals or here, not --
was not that the authorities weren't exercising State
power, but that the contention that the operation of the
hospital by the -- the special purpose corporations that
the hospital authority created was not adequately
supervised.
That is what the State was arguing in the
district court. And when it lost that point, it
withdrew from the case and has remained absent ever
since.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, we do have a
brief from quite a number of States, and the brief
basically says, we do this all the time, we set up these
local authorities, and then we give them powers because
they have to act in the world, and we give them normal
powers, like the ability to make contracts and the
ability to buy property.
And when we do that, we don't mean that they
can do anything they want, notwithstanding the antitrust
laws. And to construe these very normal powers that we
would give to a State entity, in order to allow it to
operate as a permission to violate the antitrust laws,
is not at all consistent with our own intentions.
MR. WAXMAN: I -- I have no problem with the
amicus brief filed by the States supporting the FTC in
this case, which is positive, quite expressly and at the
outset, on an understanding that what is involved here
is simply a State authorization of creation of a local
entity with general corporate powers and nothing more.
That could not be farther from this case.
These special purpose authorities do not simply have
general corporate powers. They have a mandate. There
is a Georgia constitutional amendment that coincided
with the enactment of the Hospital Authorities Law that
derogated the State's duty to provide indigent care
to its -- hospital care to its citizens.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But I'm --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is it a fair
characterization of your argument -- is it a fair
characterization of your argument to say that the
possibility that the hospital authority can use this
general power in this way is tantamount to or equivalent
to the legislature intending that it be used that way?
Is that your argument?
MR. WAXMAN: No. We take seriously the
standard that this Court announced in self-consciously
clarifying the level of explicitness that a legislature
has to use in Town of Hallie.
This Court said -- the Court asked whether,
quote, "suppression of competition was a foreseeable
result of what the State legislature authorized," and it
derived that formulation expressly from its earlier
decision in City of Lafayette, which explained that a,
quote, "adequate State mandate exists when it can
reasonably be inferred," quote, "from the authority
given a local entity to operate in a given area that the
legislature contemplated the kind of action complained
of."
In other words, as I understand this Court's
test, whether what was done by the hospital authority or
any sub-State entity was foreseeable by a reasonable
legislator, which in this case is that -- was it
foreseeable that in -- in pursuing the State-imposed
mandate to serve the indigent in a -- in a confined
jurisdiction, especially in rural counties which abound
in Georgia, a hospital authority might require market
power or even a public service monopoly because that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you --
MR. WAXMAN: -- is the natural way to acquit
the statutory mandate.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's -- there is a
problem here, which is, I understand the public mandate
to serve the indigent, but you are asking us to take
this a step further. You're elevating that public
mandate to a public command, that serving the indigent
has to override the needs of the majority, in terms of
price competition.
MR. WAXMAN: No. I don't -- I don't --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And -- and that -- that
step -- that further step that the State intended to
immunize their -- the monopoly power, is the step we are
trying to find in this grant. And that's what I don't
see. I see the -- the compulsion to serve the needy.
MR. WAXMAN: Uh-huh.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I hear that much of
Georgia is rural, but your adversary says, in most
instances, there is only one hospital, so the
municipality's taking it over is not going to be a
merger issue. To the extent that they step in and take
over one of two hospitals, there is no merger issue
because it's only substituting one owner for another.
This situation, they claim, is a rarity,
where there are only two or three providers and a
hospital's going to -- and a public -- a municipality is
going to then get monopoly power by an acquisition.
MR. WAXMAN: So, Justice Sotomayor, as to
your first point, our position is not that the only
mandate is to serve the indigent. The actual mandate in
the constitution and the Hospital Authorities Law is to
provide hospital services for all residents, with a
particular note to the obligation to serve indigent
clients.
Second of all, we are not here to -- I mean,
I don't know where the government is coming up with its
speculation that, out of Georgia's -- I think it's 154
counties, for a population of 10 million people, it is
the rare instance in which there will be anything other
than just one or -- you know, a multiplicity of
hospitals. I mean, the Federal Trade Commission
guidelines for market concentration is anything up to
four, four or fewer participants.
The notion that the legislature, in 1941,
was providing the express authority to acquire multiple
hospitals in a single municipality or county was focused
only on huge metropolises, of which there was only one,
or on counties that were so small that they couldn't
otherwise even attempt to support more than one hospital
is just fanciful; it's made up.
And --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, could -- could I
understand where you think this expressed approval is
coming from? Because you said general corporate powers
is not enough. So the general ability to buy property,
you said, is insufficient.
Then you have this idea they have a mission.
But the mission can be accomplished in all kinds of ways
that are perfectly consistent with the antitrust laws,
so that doesn't seem to get you all that far.
So what else have you got to show that the
State actually thought about this issue and approved
this power for the hospital authorities?
MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I mean, for one -- one
other thing is in Section 7 -- 7-77, as -- as was noted
before, the authorities are subject to regulation of
rate of return. Now, if that doesn't bespeak the
foreseeable consequence of market power, I don't know
what -- what does. That is the hallmark of a regulated
public service monopoly or at least the regulation of a
return by a participant with market power.
The other thing that exists -- and the
government pooh-poohs this as somehow not part of the
Hospital Authorities Law -- is that the Georgia State
legislature has -- this is -- this law was enacted in
the backdrop of other laws in which Georgia has quite
deliberately displaced, quote, "unfettered private
market competition."
The certificate of need law is the
paradigmatic example of the imposition of regulation at
the expense of free market competition and, in fact --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, a lot of States have
that. You can't open a new hospital without getting a
certificate of need. Are you saying that, in all of
those, States the -- the result is that the antitrust
laws can be ignored?
MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. Our argument is
not that the certificate -- that the existence of a
certificate of need law indicates an intent by the
legislature to fully displace the antitrust laws with
respect to anybody else.
My point is, in the context of other Georgia
systems that strictly limit entry into -- or expansion
into these local markets, combined with very severe rate
restrictions and obligations and mandates to serve --
excuse me.
JUSTICE BREYER: Your point -- I don't mean
to interrupt, but the point that he's making in response
to my earlier questions along these lines, I think, was
the following: Where do they get their hospitals, these
authorities? The -- the law sets up a hospital
authority. All right. Where did they get their
hospitals?
MR. WAXMAN: They can -- I mean, the
legislature permits them to be built, bought --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, do you know what
actually happened? Do you -- do you know, in fact,
where these hospital authorities got their hospitals
from?
MR. WAXMAN: You mean all of the hospitals
authorities in Georgia?
JUSTICE BREYER: No, not all of them, but --
I now am in a county, and suddenly, I'm the mayor, and I
see this law, and it says we can set up a hospital
authority. So Joe, I say, you are -- you are the boss,
you are the hospital authority guy. And he says -- you
are to run the hospital. And he says, what hospital?
We don't have a hospital.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: So I want to know where did
they get their hospitals?
MR. WAXMAN: The -- the answer,
Justice Breyer, I think -- I mean, there is nothing in
the record to indicate where all the hospitals --
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't need to know all of
them. I just want some rough idea where do they come from.
MR. WAXMAN: Well, let's take -- let's take
the example --
JUSTICE BREYER: You may not know.
MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. Let's take the
example of this county, in terms of what was done and
what is now being challenged. So when the hospital --
there was a public hospital, beginning in 1911, in
Dougherty County.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. WAXMAN: When the State constitution was
amended to impose on counties the State's obligation to
provide adequate hospitalization care, it enacted the
Hospital Authority Law for counties that chose to make
use of that device, in order to acquit their public
service mandate.
And Dougherty County did, soon thereafter --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MR. WAXMAN: -- establish a -- an authority,
and the assets -- all of the assets and all of the
operations of the existing hospital, were transferred.
There then -- and there was a natural monopoly in that
county.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I've got it. I've
got it. Then --
MR. WAXMAN: Then --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then he says this: I --
MR. WAXMAN: Yes. Then --
JUSTICE BREYER: He says, I have been
thinking of it the wrong way. I have been thinking of
it like the California State Public Utilities
Commission. They regulate all the electricity
producers. That isn't this.
MR. WAXMAN: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: These were a group of
people that ran some hospitals -- some municipal
hospitals, and now, they can acquire, not just
general -- I agree with you, it isn't just general.
They have a lot of power there to acquire other
hospitals from outside the system.
But, when they do that, there's no reason to
think that that gives them the power to acquire it,
where it's anticompetitive.
MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think that --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the fact that you can
regulate your own hospitals, which is one track and one
group, doesn't say that you have to bring in
anticompetitive people -- I mean, you have to bring in
others, where they're anticompetitive. That -- that, I
think, is his point.
MR. WAXMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Don't think of it as one
thing; think of it as two separate systems.
MR. WAXMAN: We're not arguing that the
Hospital Authority Law gives the hospital authorities
the right to regulate non-authority hospitals. We're
not arguing that. We're not arguing --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I know that. But
once you don't -- once you don't -- he says, you see,
they don't regulate prices at non-authority hospitals,
they don't do this for non-authority, they don't do that
for non-authority, even though they might have the power
to bring them in; but, when they have the power to bring
them in, why read this -- it's at least ambiguous -- why
read this as saying you can bring them in, where it's
anticompetitive to do so?
MR. WAXMAN: I mean, this doesn't say, you
can bring them in where it's anticompetitive to do so.
That's their any and all hypothetical. And this Court
has never required, for good reason, express authority.
That was the whole point of City of Hallie and City of
Lafayette -- Town of Hallie and City of Lafayette.
The point here is, okay, so they created a
hospital authority, it ran a public hospital, it was a
natural monopoly. The county grew. A private hospital
developed. The public hospital, which is serving more
than ten times the number of indigent patients than the
private hospital, which is very underused, the county
hospital has been -- the hospital authority has been
saying, for years and years and years, we need more
capacity, we need more capacity.
There are -- in order to accomplish our
mission, there are two ways to do it. We can only
operate in this confine. We can build a new hospital,
and here's what it would cost, and here's what we would
get. And we would, by the way, have to satisfy the
State authorities that we are entitled to a certificate
of need in the context in which the private hospital is
severely underutilized.
Or we can talk with the private hospital
about whether they would like to be acquired. And the
record shows that they did that for many, many years,
even before the Phoebe Putney entities were created.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, I'm showing
my ignorance. Is this -- would this merger be subject
to the rule of reason?
MR. WAXMAN: You mean if it --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it were -- if we were
not to find State immunity, would the merger be subject
to the rule of reason?
MR. WAXMAN: I am embarrassed to say I don't
know enough about Sherman Act laws --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I was embarrassed to ask
the question, but I was taught to ask the question. If
it is -- I'm going to assume that we'll both be -- we'll
both be corrected by our respective colleagues, soon
enough.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but if it --
MR. WAXMAN: Probably me sooner than you.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's likely.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but my question
is really more fundamental, which is, yes, I understand
that you have a great defense, potentially, to a rule of
reason challenge that -- that there was necessity in its
truest sense, in its economic sense, in this situation.
So why should we undo our decades of
writings that say that we should construe immunity
narrowly and not broadly, when it comes to displacing
our antitrust laws?
MR. WAXMAN: Because the point of State
action immunity, which is respect for the sovereign
choices of sovereign States, is -- exists not only to
provide a -- an ultimate defense in litigation on the
merits, it's to protect States and sub-State entities
from the cost of litigating.
I mean, the question, ultimately, in this
case -- and in all these cases -- is who gets to decide?
Who gets to decide if this is reasonable or not?
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if that --
MR. WAXMAN: Is it the Federal Trade
Commission that comes in and files a lawsuit for this
poor hospital authority?
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, I mean, that's
right, it is about choices, but -- but the question is
whether the State has made a choice. And that's what
all these cases are about --
MR. WAXMAN: Right.
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- is our trying to find
whether the State has made a choice as to this kind of
conduct.
MR. WAXMAN: Right.
JUSTICE KAGAN: So now, we have your
corporate powers aren't enough, your general mission
isn't enough.
You said a certificate of need, but a
certificate of need, it isn't even given out by this
authority. It's something that has nothing to do with
the powers of this authority.
Then you said there -- there's some kind of
a price regulation that happens as to the -- the
hospitals that the authority owns, but not with respect
to other hospitals.
So I guess I'm still looking for the things
that show that the State has made a choice that it wants
these -- these hospital authorities to be able to make
anticompetitive purchases. Where do I find that?
MR. WAXMAN: I may not be able to convince
you, but let me take another run. I think it's the
combination because, as this Court has expressed
repeatedly, it's -- one has to look at the specific
power granted, which here is the power to acquire
hospitals within a very circumscribed jurisdiction, in
the context of the law as a whole.
The context of the law as a whole here --
and I hope this works for the Court, but if it
doesn't -- you know, perhaps I am wrong; it certainly
makes this a stronger case than Hallie -- here, we have
a law that says counties have the obligation now, unlike
the State, to provide adequate hospitalization services.
They will exercise -- what they do is deemed
to exercise public and essential government function
within strictly limited areas. And they have the power
to acquire hospitals in those areas, subject to very
strict rate of return regulations and very, very strict
conditions on how they operate those hospitals,
including the power to lease to an operator for -- in
order to serve the public mission.
And they do that against the backdrop of a
series of -- they have eminent domain power. They can
take another hospital, if it is essential to fulfill
their mission.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman --
MR. WAXMAN: And they do this in a backdrop
of a State that has -- notwithstanding the advocacy of
the Federal Trade Commission, has repeatedly
strengthened, rather than abrogated, a -- a certificate
of need law that leads --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, you are
essentially interpreting the Georgia statute that sets
up the hospital authority. And you -- you're saying
this is how we read it. We start with the antitrust
exemption is for the State, not subdivisions, so the
State has to give it to the subdivision, for the
subdivision to have it.
Could the Federal court have said,
we -- we'd like to know what the Georgia legislature --
what the Georgia authorities think this statute means?
So, could a question have been certified -- I don't know
if Georgia has a certification procedure, but to the
Georgia Supreme Court, and said, tell us, does this
statute, is it intended to transfer the State's immunity
to the locality -- to the local unit?
MR. WAXMAN: I don't -- I mean, I -- I
assume that the Georgia State courts could do that; but,
Justice Ginsburg, I think it's important to recognize
that the FTC doesn't dispute that the -- that hospital
authority -- county hospital authorities are, in fact,
agents or arms of the State --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is does
this -- does this legislature mean that the State is
transferring its immunity to this local unit?
MR. WAXMAN: And I believe the FTC --
Mr. Horwich can correct me if I'm wrong -- but I believe
the FTC's position is, generally, yes, but not with
respect to the -- what is alleged to be a merger to
monopoly.
And the question in this case is whether or
not the acts, under this law and applying the
foreseeable result standard, whether the acts of the
hospital authority in this case in approving and
acquiring the second hospital are fairly attributable to
the State.
And if I could just --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, if you don't
want to be interrupted, you have to pause between
sentences.
(Laughter.)
MR. WAXMAN: I was taking a cue from Your
Honor the last argument.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. That's
right.
You've given a -- you know, an appealing
example of a small county that has one -- one hospital,
and this operation purchases that one -- one hospital.
Seems nothing wrong with that; although, as Justice
Sotomayor suggests, I doubt whether the FTC would be
pursuing a situation in which there is a natural
monopoly. It's a question of whether the monopoly would
be owned by the State or not.
But your argument, if we follow it, embraces
a quite different situation, a very large county which
has five hospitals that are competing vigorously in
price, in specialties, they advertise on the radio, as
some hospitals do.
And what you're saying is that this
operation can take over all of those hospitals and
eliminate all of that competition. Isn't that so?
MR. WAXMAN: Well, I -- for purposes of
Federal antitrust law, yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MR. WAXMAN: But for purposes of State law,
almost certainly no. And the point here is -- and that
is the point here. The point is that Georgia, either
through both private suits and actions authorized by its
attorney general, can take steps in order to restrain
hospital authorities from doing what they -- and, in
fact --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We have no -- we have no
idea whether they are willing to do that.
MR. WAXMAN: Oh, yes, we do.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And we have a Federal
antitrust law.
MR. WAXMAN: We -- we absolutely do,
Justice Scalia. There is a solid line of cases in which
the Georgia Supreme Court has -- has quite rigorously
enforced the limitations of the Hospital Authority Law,
in order to prevent hospital authorities from doing
things that it says the legislature didn't intend. The
Tift County case is the best example, but there are
others cited in our brief.
The last point --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why didn't it intend
this? I don't understand. You -- you've told us that
they did intend this, that they did intend to displace
competition.
MR. WAXMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And now, you say, but
Georgia will say, oh, no, they didn't intend to displace
competition.
MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. My --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is it?
MR. WAXMAN: My point is that, with respect
to your hypothetical, whether the hospital authority of
Fulton County -- and I believe there is more than one
hospital authority in Fulton County, and they are
authorized to merge, in any event -- but could they
acquire, by purchase or eminent domain, all of the
hospitals in metropolitan Atlanta to do so? And my
point is that for purposes of Federal antitrust law the
answer is you are out -- that's -- you are not the
authority to inquire.
The question is -- just as this Court -- you
explained for the Court in Omni, there may be very many
things that a local authority can do that would violate
State law, and there are State law remedies. And my
point only was that the Georgia Supreme Court has been
very quick to enforce the limitations.
But as a matter of Federal antitrust law,
the only question is were they -- were they authorized
to do things like this? And if I --
JUSTICE BREYER: And they -- they say on
that, that it's a sham. Well, just say 30 seconds on
their argument, that the FTC looked into it, these
people had never regulated anything, they'd never looked
at any price anywhere, they've never done a single
thing, it's a sham; and therefore, that's the end of it.
What about that?
MR. WAXMAN: Okay. If I can just finish my
answer to Justice -- I have one other point to make
for -- to Justice Kagan, who has asked it twice.
The -- my last point I want to make -- and
then I will answer this -- is that this county -- this
hospital authority, like many, facing a capacity
constraint and a -- and a nondiscretionary mandate to
serve the public needs for hospitalization, had two
choices.
It could have tried to convince the State to
spend three times as much money to get half the number
of beds, notwithstanding the existence of excess
capacity; or it could buy the other hospital and get
that capacity in a consensual transaction by the
authority.
And here's my point, Justice Scalia, this
case is on all fours with this Court's decision in Omni.
The notion that this may have long been desired by
this -- this special-purpose entity is totally
irrelevant. This -- this acquisition was proposed to,
considered by, and -- and approved by the hospital
authority.
And not only that, when the FTC came and
complained about it, they reconvened another public
meeting and discussed it again and came to the
conclusion again that they wanted to acquire this
hospital.
And before they signed the lease, they
issued a notice and comment period. There was three
months for people to tell the authority whether this
lease was or was not consistent with community
interests. They had a public meeting, and they approved
it. And that is the act of the State.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can the State --
does the State have a procedure where it can give
real-time approval? In other words, this is going on,
and the hospital authority says, boy, the FTC is sending
us these letters. State, could you do something to show
that you approve this transaction, whether it's a
special law or there is some organization, I guess, in
some other case, setup, that could give its approval?
Is there --
MR. WAXMAN: I mean, this is -- the Hospital
Authorities Law says, counties, this is your
responsibility, here are your powers. If anybody in the
State or any competitor or the attorney general thinks
that you are abusing those statutory powers, the courts
are open and quite receptive to those concerns. But
there's no --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know. But I
guess my point is can the burden of going forward be
switched the other way? And can this hospital authority
say -- you know, to the State, we would like some
blessing on this, so that we can go ahead with it?
So the choices aren't really build your own
hospital or acquire the other one, in the abstract, but
ask the State -- you know, what do you want us to do?
Do you want us to build a new hospital? Or is it okay
if we acquire this one?
MR. WAXMAN: I don't believe there is any
such mechanism, and I believe that the -- the State --
the legislature didn't contemplate anything like that,
because the mandate and the responsibility and the
authorization was devolved to the counties.
Now, Mr. Chief Justice, what the -- what the
hospital authority could do and did do, although it's
not in the record of this case, is evaluate the
likelihood of getting a certificate of need to build the
additional required facilities.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HORWICH: Thank you.
I guess I -- I heard several members of the
Court asking Mr. Waxman, specifically, Where do you find
this? Where can you locate this intent to displace
competition in the statute? And I would like to just
run through, if I could, each of his answers and why I
think they are insufficient.
So the first one, of course, we've talked a
lot about the existence of general corporate powers, but
the most natural inference there is that the State
expects those to be exercised in conformity with the
background principles that anybody else who has general
powers has.
Now, the idea that the authority has a
mandate, a purpose it's supposed to serve, of course,
that's always true. States always have some purpose in
mind when they set up some sub-State entity. The
question isn't whether there is particular ends the
State is trying to pursue.
The question here is whether the State
intended to pursue those ends through the particular
means of displacing competition, here, displacing
competition in the market for paid healthcare services.
And see Mr. Waxman also pointed to the rate of
return provision in the statute. Now, as a sort of a
threshold matter, there's -- if past is prologue, there
is not any reason to think that that will be not be
rigorously enforced with respect to the privately
controlled operations here. But -- and that's sort of
the second question presented, and we can set that aside
for the moment, I guess.
But it seems to me there are two far more
natural explanations for the presence of the rate of
return provision in the statute than the one Mr. Waxman
would like you to -- to give to it.
The first explanation is this is a statute
about providing public care for indigents. Nobody
should be making a profit off of that, and the State
wants to say that. And that seems to be a very natural
explanation that doesn't depend at all on the State
intending to displace competition completely.
The -- the rate -- the price regulation
provision also can be naturally understood as a response
to the recognition that there will be some de facto
monopolies in the situation where there is only one
hospital in the county.
But it does not mean that the State wants
there to be more monopolies, so that it can bring in the
unfortunate medicine of rate regulation to respond to
those. Presumably, the State intends, as is the
accepted background principle of free market competition
in this country, that there won't be monopolies, unless
they -- unless they arise of necessity.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I
interrupt --
MR. HORWICH: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you, just a moment,
to address a question raised by Justice Breyer, which is
your alternative argument?
MR. HORWICH: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have lots of
evidence that the authority does very little oversight
of these hospitals when they move forward. But is that
the issue before us? Is the question of immunity as to
what happens in the operation of the hospital or in
their merger and acquisition, their actual formation?
And -- so that to the extent that we were to
conclude that the State has delegated immunity on the
basis of merger, why do we need to look any further at
whether there has or has not been an appropriate degree
of supervision of that decision?
MR. HORWICH: Right. Well, the -- the --
I -- I don't think the two are entirely -- are entirely
separable, as a matter of competition law, because the
reason the competition law is concerned with mergers is
not because of the transaction as such, but it's because
of what it does going forward to the structure of the
market and the competitive behavior of those in the
market.
And so the State Action Doctrine says that
the State -- if the State's going to go create monopoly,
it needs to take ownership of that monopoly. And I'm
using ownership not in the literal sense, but at least
ownership in the sense of actively supervising the
monopoly, to be sure that it is pursuing the -- the
objectives that the State has in mind for creating it.
So that's -- that's why we are still concerned there.
Mr. Waxman referred to the Certificate of
Need Law. I think there is a very close analogy to be
drawn to Goldfarb here. That is the -- the question of
minimum fee schedules agreed to by lawyers. The State
of -- the State of Virginia regulated entry into the
market for the practice of law, just as the certificate
of need regulates entry into the hospital market.
But horizontal agreements among people
already in the market, such as here and such as the
minimum fee schedule in Goldfarb, are not exempt just
because of it.
Thank you.
