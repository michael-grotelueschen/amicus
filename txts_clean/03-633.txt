Mr. Layton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. LAYTON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LAYTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Though bound by Stanford v. Kentucky, the
Missouri Supreme Court rejected both its holding and its
rationale. This Court should stay the course it set in
Stanford, leaving in the hands of legislators a
determination as to the precise minimum age for capital
punishment within the realm of Thompson v. Oklahoma, and
leaving to jurors responsibility for determining the
culpability of individual defendants above that minimum
age.
The Missouri court justified its departure from
Stanford on Atkins v. Virginia, but the result it reached
is quite different from the result in Stanford. In that
-- excuse me -- in Atkins. In that case, the Court was
addressing mental ability, itself a component of
culpability. The Court announced a principle based on
that characteristic, that is, that the mentally retarded
are not to be eligible for capital punishment, but then it
left to the States the determination of the standard and
the means of implementing that principle.
The Missouri Supreme Court, by contrast, jumped
beyond the question of maturity, which is an element of
culpability analysis, to the arbitrary distinction of age.
It drew a line based purely on age, which is necessarily
over-inclusive, and then it gave that line constitutional
status, thus depriving legislators and juries of the
ability to evaluate the maturity of 17-year-old defenders.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't leave it up to
the States entirely. I mean, you -- you mean the States
could adopt any definition of mental retardation they
want?
MR. LAYTON: No. The States certainly --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So there's -- there's some
minimal level of mental retardation. Right?
MR. LAYTON: There is some minimal level.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And isn't that necessarily
over-inclusive, just as picking any single age is
necessarily over-inclusive?
MR. LAYTON: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely there will be some
people who -- who, although they have that level of mental
retardation, with regard to the particular crime in
question, are deserving of the death penalty.
MR. LAYTON: I -- I don't agree that it would be
over-inclusive, given the Court's analysis in Atkins. The
Court said that someone who has that level of mental
retardation is simply not sufficiently culpable by
definition. That certainly would not be true here. There
are 17-year-olds who are equally culpable with those who
are 18, 20, 25, or some other age.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the age 18 is set even
for such things as buying tobacco. The -- the dividing
line between people who are members of the community, the
adult community, is pervasively 18, to vote, to sit on
juries, to serve in the military. Why should it be that
someone is death-eligible under the age of 18 but not
eligible to be an adult member of the community?
MR. LAYTON: I think that legislators would be
surprised, when they adopted those statutes, that they
were affecting their criminal law. In fact, many of those
statutes have individualized determinations, the military
being one of them. 17-year-olds can enlist. There is an
individualized determination, albeit by parents, not the
Government. 17-year-olds may be serving in Iraq today.
That -- the other kinds of examples that you cite, for
example, tobacco --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But with parental -- they are
wards of their parents.
MR. LAYTON: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So their parents -- the same
thing with marriage. A 17-year-old can marry but not
without parental consent.
MR. LAYTON: Although in most instances can
marry if they go to a court and demonstrate they are
sufficiently mature, again contemplating individualized
determination, which the Missouri Supreme Court says does
not exist as to 17-year-olds with regard to capital
punishment.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why pick -- why pick on the
death penalty? I mean, if you're going to say that
somehow people under 18 are juveniles for all purposes,
why -- why just pick on the death penalty? Why -- why not
say they're immune from any criminal penalty?
MR. LAYTON: Well, I -- I must assume that if we
-- if the Court says they are immune from the -- from
capital punishment that someone will come and say they
also must be immune from, for example, life without
parole.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure that -- I'm sure that
would follow. I -- I don't see where there's a logical
line.
MR. LAYTON: No. The -- the problem with
adopting the -- the 18-year-old line is that it is
essentially arbitrary. It's the kind of line that
legislators and not courts adopt.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But didn't -- didn't
we adopt a 16-year-old line in our earlier case?
MR. LAYTON: In -- in Thompson, the Court in a
4-1-4 decision struck a 15-year-old -- a 15-year-old
execution, and the States have taken, including Missouri
through its General Assembly, have taken that to mean that
there is a 16-year-old line. And today, in fact, I think
it's true that there is a consensus nationally with regard
to the 16-year-old line, not because it has some
biological or psychological magic, but because perhaps --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but -- but there was --
it's about the same consensus that existed in the
retardation case.
MR. LAYTON: Absolutely, that's true. If you
look at the -- the --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And -- and so are we somehow
required to at least look at that? I mean, the statistics
of how many States have approved 18 years as the line is
about the same as those in the retardation case.
MR. LAYTON: The -- the Court has kind of three
groups of cases with regard to the number of States. On
one extreme, are Enmund and Coker where you have three and
eight States. On the other extreme, are Penry and
Stanford where you have 24 and 34 States. And then
there's this middle group, which isn't just Atkins and
this case. It's also Tison, which is also almost exactly
the same number.
The Court in Atkins had to find a way of
distinguishing Tison, to the extent the Court relied on
that -- that counting process, and the -- the Court
concluded that there was kind of an inexorable trend with
regard to the mentally retarded. We don't have that kind
of trend here. In --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we -- we have a different
kind of trend. What do you make -- you spoke of a
consensus, but what do you make of the fact that over the
last, I guess, 10- or 12-year period, the actual
imposition of the death penalty for -- for those whose
crimes were -- were under 18 has -- has steadily been
dropping. I think 10 years ago, there were 13. Last
year, I -- I think the figures were that there were two.
The -- the consensus seems to be eroding, and yet as -- as
the counsel on the other side pointed out, this has been
occurring at a time when -- when treating juvenile crime
seriously has not, in fact, been eroding at all. What --
what are we supposed to make of that?
MR. LAYTON: Well, two things.
Number one is that capital sentences have been
dropping for all ages, not just for those under 18. So it
-- you have to take that into account.
The second is that although the last --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Has -- has the -- has the rate
of attrition been the same?
MR. LAYTON: It is --
JUSTICE SOUTER: 13 to 2 is pretty spectacular.
MR. LAYTON: It is not --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't think we've seen that,
or maybe we have seen that, for -- for death imposition
generally. Is that so?
MR. LAYTON: It is certainly greater, but part
of the problem is we're dealing with such small numbers
for the -- the juveniles, those under 18, that the
difference of one or two makes a huge difference in how
the numbers come out.
But if you look over the last 10 years, in fact,
it has gone up and down and currently is in a down trend,
but the down trend --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it went up once I think,
didn't it?
MR. LAYTON: It -- it went up once within --
since -- since Stanford and then came back down. Now,
whether this -- this period in which it comes back down is
going to remain that way or whether we'll go back up to
where we were 10 years ago I don't know. That's entirely
hypothetical to suggest that -- that this very recent
trend is more dispositive than the trends over the last 10
years.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so you're basically --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You're -- you're basically
saying that the -- the time is too short, the numbers are
too small --
MR. LAYTON: Right.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- to infer anything.
MR. LAYTON: Right, and the time is too short on
the legislative side as well. We're only talking about
the States that have adopted new legislation having done
so, one of them in 1999 and the others simply in 2002 and
2004. If we were to look at the history of -- of capital
punishment in the United States, there are many times when
States have abolished capital punishment and then
returned. And Justice --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you were in the midst
of telling us why the -- there is a consensus now that
it's inappropriate to execute anyone under 16, and I -- I
-- you weren't --
MR. LAYTON: No. It --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You couldn't finish that
answer. I want to know it.
MR. LAYTON: Since -- since Stanford, we have
had no executions under 16 even though it is possible to
read Justice O'Connor's opinion in that case as allowing a
State to adopt a statute that specifically says 15. No
one has tried that. Everyone seems to have taken Thompson
and Stanford together to mean there is a 16-year-old line.
Two States have adopted 16 by statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and so you say there's
-- there's not so much as a consensus as an understanding
of what that decision means.
MR. LAYTON: I -- I think that that's right.
There are States that have adopted it specifically and
others have simply implemented it. If I were a prosecutor
today, I -- it's hard to imagine that I would -- even in a
State where I could find a statute saying I could
prosecute someone under age 16, that I would try such a
thing.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask you this. I
-- I don't yet have the -- the record showing the full
closing argument of -- of both sides, but we do have the
portion where the prosecutor says, isn't this scary? Can
adolescence ever be anything but mitigating?
MR. LAYTON: I -- I don't know how it could be
anything but mitigating. But what we have in that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's not how the
prosecution presented it to the jury.
MR. LAYTON: In that statement, but --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: He said -- he -- he almost
made it aggravating. Isn't that scary? I don't have the
-- I don't have the full argument.
MR. LAYTON: No. What -- what he's facing is --
is 18 pages of transcript that occupied the -- the defense
counsel's argument. Of those 18 pages, 4 pages are
dedicated purely to Mr. Simmons' youth, and throughout the
rest of the argument, he uses terms to reinforce that. He
refers to him repeatedly as a 17-year-old. He calls him a
kid. He does things to reinforce with the jury that he's
very young.
So then we come back and in a few pages of
rebuttal, we have a couple of words -- I shouldn't say
that -- two sentences in which the prosecutor is trying to
respond to that particular lengthy theme and argument.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was pretty clear. The --
the words in question were: Think about age. 17 years
old. Isn't that scary? Doesn't that scare you?
Mitigating? Quite the contrary I submit. Quite the
contrary.
MR. LAYTON: And if we were here because Mr.
Simmons said that was improper and the Missouri Supreme
Court said that was improper, well, we wouldn't be here.
We wouldn't have asked for certiorari. The Court wouldn't
have granted it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is, can --
is -- is age, youth inevitably mitigating, and here is a
prosecutor giving the answer no, it can be aggravating.
MR. LAYTON: The Missouri statute requires that
an instruction be given that says that age is a mitigator,
and the -- the instruction was given here. And the jury
heard argument concerning that particular claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what's -- what's the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's somewhat --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the contrary of -- of
mitigating? I -- I would assume --
MR. LAYTON: Aggravating, but aggravating --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it? I -- I would assume
it's not mitigating.
MR. LAYTON: Well, you're right, Your Honor,
because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the opposite of
mitigating is aggravating, but it -- it's perfectly good
English to say, mitigating? Quite the contrary --
MR. LAYTON: It is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not at all mitigating.
MR. LAYTON: Yes. And -- and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't know why you give
that one away.
MR. LAYTON: Certainly aggravating circumstances
are defined in the Missouri statute, and they were defined
in the instructions. So this was not to be considered by
the jury as an aggravator.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let's focus on the word
unusual. Forget cruel for the moment, although they're
both obviously involved.
We've seen very substantial demonstration that
world opinion is -- is against this, at least as
interpreted by the leaders of the European Union. Does
that have a bearing on what's unusual? Suppose it were
shown that the United States were one of the very, very few
countries that executed juveniles, and that's true. Does
that have a bearing on whether or not it's unusual?
MR. LAYTON: No more than if we were one of the
very few countries that didn't do this. It would bear on
the question of unusual. The decision as to the Eighth
Amendment should not be based on what happens in the rest
of the world. It needs to be based on the mores of -- of
American society.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Have the countries of the
European Union abolished the death penalty by popular
vote?
MR. LAYTON: I don't know how they've done that,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought they did it by reason
of a judgment of a court --
MR. LAYTON: Well, in fact --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which required all of them
to abolish it.
MR. LAYTON: I -- I believe that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought that some of the
public opinion polls in -- in a number of the countries
support the death penalty.
MR. LAYTON: I believe that there are countries
in Europe who abolish it because of their membership in
the European Union --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I acknowledged that in --
in my question. I recognize it is the leadership in many
of these countries that objects to it.
But let us -- let us assume that it's an
accepted practice in most countries of the world not to
execute a juvenile for moral reasons. That has no bearing
on whether or not what we're doing is unusual?
MR. LAYTON: I -- I can't concede that it does
because it's unimaginable to me that we would be willing
to accept the alternative, the flip side of that argument.
It does seem to me, however, that that goes to a
particular -- back to the aspect where I began --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there any on --
on that? Is there any indication? I mean, I've never
seen any either way, to tell you the truth, but -- that
Madison or Jefferson or whoever, when they were writing
the Constitution, would have thought what happened
elsewhere, let's say, in Britain or in the British -- they
were a British colony. They did think Blackstone was
relevant. Did any -- that they would have thought it was
totally irrelevant what happened elsewhere in the world to
the word unusual. Is there any indication in any debate
or any of the ratification conventions?
MR. LAYTON: Nothing that I have seen has
suggested that --
JUSTICE BREYER: So if Lincoln --
MR. LAYTON: -- one way or the other.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- Abraham Lincoln used to
study Blackstone and I think he thought that the Founding
Fathers studied Blackstone, and all that happened in
England was relevant, is there some special reason why
what happens abroad would not be relevant here? Relevant.
MR. LAYTON: There's a --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying controlling.
MR. LAYTON: There's a special reason why
Blackstone would be relevant because that was the law from
which they were operating when they put this language into
the Constitution.
JUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely, and they, I guess,
were looking at English practices, and would they have
thought it was wrong to look abroad as a relevant feature?
MR. LAYTON: And -- and I don't know the answer
to that, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we -- do we ever take the
position that what we do here should influence what people
think elsewhere?
MR. LAYTON: I -- I have not seen that overtly
in any of the Court's opinions, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you thought that Mr.
Jefferson thought that what we did here had no bearing on
the rest of the world?
MR. LAYTON: Oh, I -- I think Mr. Jefferson
thought that. I think many of the Founders thought that
they were leading the world, and I have no objection to us
leading the world, but Mr. Jefferson's lead of the world
was through the legislature not through the courts.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But did he not also say that
to -- to lead the world, we would have to show a decent
respect for the opinions of mankind?
MR. LAYTON: That -- that may well be.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What did John Adams think of
the French?
(Laughter.)
MR. LAYTON: I read a biography of John Adams
recently. I recall that he didn't think highly of them.
(Laughter.)
MR. LAYTON: The -- Missouri, in order to
implement the principle that those who are immature should
not be subject to capital punishment, has adopted an
approach that, first off, excludes anyone age 16 and under
from capital punishment; second, requires certification by
the juvenile court for anyone who is 16, but otherwise
turns the matter over to the jury and defines it as a
statutory mitigator.
The kind of evidence that is discussed in Mr.
Simmons' brief at some length could have been applied --
could have been presented during the penalty phase of Mr.
Simmons' trial. It has been reflected in decisions of
this Court as far back as Eddings where there was evidence
of mental and emotional development. In Penry, there was
evidence of mental age and social maturity. And here, in
the post-conviction proceeding, Mr. Simmons presented such
evidence regarding his impulsivity, his susceptibility to
peer pressure, and his immaturity. But he didn't present
that at trial. There is a mechanism in Missouri for him
to do that and he chose not to.
JUSTICE BREYER: Before you go off on this, the
one statistic that interested me -- and I'd like you to
discuss its relevance really -- is if we look back 10
years, I have only three States executing a juvenile:
Texas, 11; Virginia, 3; and Oklahoma, 2.
MR. LAYTON: Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: And those three States account
for about 11 percent of the population of the country,
11.3 percent.
Now, if we go back a few more years to Stanford,
we get three others in there: Louisiana, 1; Georgia, 1;
and Missouri, 1.
MR. LAYTON: And if you go to the convictions
rather than the executions, then Alabama goes into that
mix.
JUSTICE BREYER: We have a very different
number.
MR. LAYTON: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: So the reason that I thought
arguably it's more relevant to look at the convictions is
there are a lot of States. Say, New Hampshire, I think,
for example -- when I was in the First Circuit, there were
several States that on the books permitted the death
penalty, but nobody ever had ever been executed. And --
and that's true across the country. There are a number of
States like that. So if we look at the States that
actually execute people, it's 10 years, say, 11 percent of
the population are in such States. You go back 15 years,
and you get these three other States, which raises the
percentage.
How -- how should I understand that? I'm
interested in both sides --
MR. LAYTON: Frankly, we don't know what those
numbers mean because we don't know to what extent
juveniles are committing capital level murders. We -- and
there is no way in current social science to make that
determination.
It's interesting that among the three States --
two of the three States that are on that list that Justice
Breyer mentioned are States in which there is a specific
instruction to the jury, or indeed, in Texas, a
requirement, that the jury evaluate future dangerousness.
That is, the argument that was referred to by opposing --
or that counsel made, the State's counsel made, the
prosecutor made, in the -- in the trial here, there's
actually an instruction in some of those States. And that
may play into the manner in which this -- those States --
the reason those States have additional convictions and
additional executions.
But Missouri doesn't have that. We don't
require that the jury find future dangerousness, and
although that may come up in the course of a mitigation
and aggravation argument in the penalty phase, it isn't
highlighted like it is in those States. And that may be
more problematic than the system that Missouri has
created.
If the kind of evidence, psychosocial evidence,
that is cited in Mr. Simmons' brief had been presented at
the penalty phase, of course there would have been an
opportunity to rebut it, to question it. Instead, what we
have in this case is the marshaling of untested evidence
from various cause groups and some dispassionate
observers.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: At what point was this
inserted into the record, Mr. Layton?
MR. LAYTON: The -- the kind of -- well, as to
Mr. Simmons specifically, it came in in the post-
conviction proceeding, and then was also present in the
habeas record. In this case, the -- the lengthy litany of
scientific studies appeared for the first time in his
brief in this Court. There were references to a few of
them before, but nothing --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: It was never -- never
tested in the trial court.
MR. LAYTON: Oh, no. Oh, no, because he never
made the argument in the trial court during his trial that
-- that scientifically he was too immature to be culpable
to the degree that would merit capital punishment.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, at least to the extent
that he's simply quoting public sources, you had a chance
to quote public sources in -- in return.
MR. LAYTON: Absolutely.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So I think you're -- you're
even on that --
MR. LAYTON: Absolutely.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- or at least your opportunity
is.
MR. LAYTON: I -- and I think the reason that we
did that and we cited the difficulties in our reply brief
with what he cited is to highlight that the precise age is
a legislative question based on legislative type facts.
Legislatures can evaluate this series of studies and then
pick what is essentially an arbitrary age. There is no
study in anything that Mr. Simmons cites that -- that
justifies that particular day, 18. They talk about
adolescence. They talk about young adolescence, old
adolescence. They talk about adolescence continuing until
the mid-20's. Nothing justifies the age of 18. That
makes it the kind of fact that a legislature ought to be
evaluating, not a court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Does adolescence as a
scientific term -- does it always occur on the same day
for -- for all individuals?
MR. LAYTON: No. The -- the studies point out
that adolescence is -- well, they don't agree on what
adolescence means, and they don't -- and they point out
that it begins and ends on different times for different
people. So we don't know what adolescence means in the
studies, and we don't know what it would mean were the
Court to base a decision on the -- this concept of
adolescence.
I'd like to reserve the rest of my time, if
there are no other questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Layton.
Mr. Waxman, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Everyone agrees that there is some age below
which juveniles can't be subjected to the death penalty.
The question here is where our society's evolving
standards of decency now draw that line.
15 years ago, this Court found insufficient
evidence to justify a bright line at 18, but since
Stanford, a consensus has evolved and new scientific
evidence has emerged, and these developments change the
constitutional calculus for much the same reasons the
Court found compelling in Atkins. As was noted --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can the constitutional calculus
ever move in the other direction? I mean, once we hold
that, you know, 16 is the age, if there's new scientific
evidence that shows that some people are quite mature at
18 or at -- at 17-and-a-half or if -- if there is a -- a
new feeling among the people that youthful murderers are,
indeed, a serious problem and -- and deterrence is
necessary, can we ever go back?
MR. WAXMAN: Well, there is a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's sort of a one-way ratchet.
Isn't it?
MR. WAXMAN: There is a one-way ratchet here as
there is whenever this Court draws a constitutional line;
that is, whenever this Court determines that the
Constitution preempts the ability of legislatures to
make --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but what -- what
if a State legislature decides that, sure, the Supreme
Court said in the Simmons case that you can't execute
anybody under 18, but we think there's kind of a tendency
the other way, we're going to pass a statute and see what
happens in court?
MR. WAXMAN: Well, you could -- you could have,
I guess, what I refer to as the Dickerson v. United States
phenomenon. It could come up. But what's -- what's
really interesting -- I think what's --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Is it -- is that a
closed book? I mean, granted, you may lose the argument,
but is it a permissible argument that the standards have
evolved the other way?
MR. WAXMAN: It -- it certainly would be a
permissible -- permissible argument.
What's -- what's notable here, Justice Scalia
and Mr. Chief Justice, is how robust this consensus is.
We're talking not only about the whole variety of ways in
which our society has concluded that 18 is the bright line
between childhood and adulthood and that 18 is the line
below which we preserve -- presume immaturity. But the
line with respect to executions, the trend is very robust
and it is very deep.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't -- we don't use 18 for
everything. Aren't there States that -- that allow
adolescents to drive at the age of 16?
MR. WAXMAN: There are nine States that allow
adolescents to drive at the age of 16 without their
parents' consent. That -- driving, of course, is the
classic example, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: With their parents' consent --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: With their parents' consent,
how many?
MR. WAXMAN: To -- to -- there are 41 States
that require parental consent below 18.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But they can drive.
MR. WAXMAN: But they can drive if their parents
agree. My -- my --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If it's okay with the parents,
it's okay with the State.
MR. WAXMAN: My point here is that with respect
to the death penalty, we have a substantial consensus
within the United States, as it happens, exactly the same
lineup as existed in -- as existed in -- was true in
Atkins. We have not just a worldwide consensus that
represents the better view in Europe. There are 194
countries --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, how does one --
how does one determine what is the better view?
MR. WAXMAN: I was -- I was referring to the
implication that it has often been said that because the
European Union thinks something, we should, therefore,
presume that the world views it that way. We're now
talking about --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Are you suggesting
that we adopt that principle?
MR. WAXMAN: To the contrary. My point is we
are not talking about just what a particular European
treaty requires. We -- the -- the eight States that --
that theoretically -- that have statutes that
theoretically permit execution of offenders under 18 are
not only alone in this country, they are alone in the
world. Every country in the world, including China and
Nigeria and Saudi Arabia and the -- and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, every one has agreed formally and
legislatively to renounce this punishment, and the only
country besides the United States that has not is Somalia,
which as this Court was reminded yesterday, has no
organized government. It is incapable --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They have a lot of customs that
we don't have. They don't allow most -- almost all of
them do not allow -- have trial by jury. Should we -- and
they think it's not only more efficient, it is fairer
because juries are, you know, unpredictable and whatnot.
Should we yield to the views of the rest of the world?
MR. WAXMAN: Of course not, but this is a --
this is a standard which -- a constitutional test that
looks to evolving standards of moral decency that go to
human dignity. And in that regard, it is -- it is notable
that we are literally alone in the world even though 110
countries in the world permit capital punishment for one
purpose -- for one crime or another, and yet every one --
every one formally renounces it for juvenile offenders.
And, Justice Kennedy, my submission isn't that
that that's set -- you know, game, set, and match. It's
just relevant, and I think it is relevant in terms of the
existence of a consensus.
There was reference made by my opponent to the
fact that there are four States that set the age at 17 and
four States that set the age at 16. No -- in terms of
movement, no one has suggested that any of those States or
any other State has ever lowered the age. In fact, if you
look at those particular -- those eight States, a number
of them legislated an age that represented raising the
number over what had previously been permitted. The
movement, as this Court addressed, talked about in Atkins,
has all been in one direction, and it's not as if that
movement, in and of itself, answers the question. But
where you have the type of consensus that exists here, as
it did in Atkins, and where you have a scientific
community that in Stanford was absent -- the American
Medical Association, the American Psychological
Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the
major medical and scientific associations, were not able
in 1989, based on the evidence, to come to this Court and
say there is scientific, empirical validation for
requiring that the line be set at 18.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in fact, the American
Psychological Association is not your brief. You're not
accountable for inconsistencies there.
But I -- I would like your comment. They came
to us in Hodgson v. Minnesota, as I think the State quite
correctly points out, and said that with reference to the
age for determining whether the child could have an
abortion without parental consent, that adults -- that
they -- that they were risk -- that they could assess
risk, that they had rational capacity, and they completely
flip-flop in this case.
MR. WAXMAN: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that just because of -- is
that just because of this modern evidence?
MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. I don't -- I think
it's -- it may be in small part to that, Justice Kennedy,
but I think the main point is that what their brief looked
to -- what the argument was was our -- are adolescents
cognitively different than adults. And the answer is, as
we -- our brief concedes, is generally no.
And what was at issue in the abortion cases was
competency to decide. And just as we allow the mentally
retarded the ability to decide whether or not to obtain an
abortion but not to be subject to a penalty that is
reserved for the tiny fraction of murderers that are so
depraved that we call them the worst of the worst, here
competency to decide here, as with the mentally retarded,
isn't the issue.
Christopher Simmons was found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, to have committed this offense with the
specific intent necessary to do it, just as the mentally
retarded can be. The issue in Hodgson was cognitive
ability to be able to make a competent decision. And so I
don't -- I didn't represent the APA then and I don't now,
but I don't, with respect, think there's an inconsistency.
In fact, the difference here goes to the factors
that Atkins identified about why overwhelmingly the
mentally retarded -- and here adolescents -- are less
morally capable. They are much, much less likely to be
sufficiently mature to be among the worst of the worst.
And here, even more than with the mentally retarded, the
few 16- and 17-year-olds who might, if we could even
determine it, be -- we could determine were in fact so
depraved that they were among the worst of the worst,
there is no way reliably to identify them and there's no way
reliably to exclude them. And it is in this respect that
science I think changes.
At the time of Stanford, everybody on this
Court, of course, knew what all of us as adults
intuitively know, which is that adolescents -- and -- and
here we're talking about -- I agree that when adolescence
starts and when it ends is undefined. But every
scientific and medical journal and study acknowledges that
16- and 17-year-olds are the heartland. No one excludes
them. And what we know from the science essentially
explains and validates the consensus that society has
already developed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: If all of this is so clear, why
can't the State legislature take it into account?
MR. WAXMAN: Well, one could have said --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if it's such an
overwhelming case that -- that we can prescribe it for the
whole country, you would expect that the number of States
that -- that now permit it would not permit it. All you
have to do is bring these facts to the attention of the
legislature, and they can investigate the accuracy of the
studies that the American Psychological Association does
or other associations in a manner that we can't. We just
have to read whatever you put in front of us.
MR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, the number of
States that engage in these executions is very small, and
if it were all of the States, none of this Court's Eighth
Amendment jurisprudence would ever have to come -- would
ever have to be developed. But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's precisely because
the jury considers youthfulness as one of the mitigating
factors. It doesn't surprise me that the death penalty
for 16- to 18-year-olds is rarely imposed. I would expect
it would be. But it -- it's a question of whether you
leave it to the jury to evaluate the person's youth and
take that into account or whether you adopt a hard rule
that nobody who is under 18 is -- is -- has committed such
a heinous crime with such intent that he -- that he
deserves the death penalty.
MR. WAXMAN: Justice -- Justice Scalia, there's
no doubt -- and the jury was instructed -- that age is a
mitigating factor although, Justice Kennedy, in response
to your question, our brief points out prosecutors, in the
context of future dangerousness, which is relevant, argue
it all the time and jurors intuitively think it all the
time.
But the fact that he could have made an
individualized mitigating case or argued that he was only
-- that he was young, as he did, doesn't address the
constitutional problem. The constitutional problem is
that overwhelmingly 16- and 17-year-olds, for reasons of
the -- the developmental reasons relating to their
psychosocial character --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, Mr. Waxman, was
that in evidence that you referred to from these various
associations? Was that introduced at trial?
MR. WAXMAN: The -- about the character --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes.
MR. WAXMAN: No. The trial was -- I'm making an
observation just as in -- as in Atkins --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but I -- I would
think if you want to rely on evidence like that, it ought
to be introduced at trial and subject to cross examination
rather than just put in amicus briefs.
MR. WAXMAN: Oh, no, Mr. Chief Justice. I'm not
making an argument about the character or maturity of this
defendant, which would have been the only thing that would
be --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: No. But you're making
an argument that science says people this age are simply
different, and it seems to me you -- if that's to be an
argument, it ought to be introduced at trial.
MR. WAXMAN: I -- I -- it's an argument about
what the Constitution prohibits. It's an argument about
where a constitutional line should be drawn.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but you're --
you're talking facts basically and facts ordinarily are
adduced at trial for cross examination.
MR. WAXMAN: Well, I am not aware of any
instance in which legislative facts, as you will call
them, that is, facts that go to where a line should be
drawn, whether it's by this Court because the Constitution
ought to be so interpreted or a legislation should change,
would be properly introduced to a jury that is supposed to
accept the law, that has required to accept the law as is
given by a judge --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, how about in the
-- how about in the habeas proceeding?
MR. WAXMAN: In the habeas proceeding, it's --
it's -- an argument could have been made and, indeed, was
made in this case that the line -- that under Atkins
juvenile offenders are the same and --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, was this
evidence adduced at the habeas proceeding?
MR. WAXMAN: The habeas -- if you're talking
about the -- the scientific studies --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Right.
MR. WAXMAN: -- in peer-reviewed journals, it
was not.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, surely at the
trial, you could have had a psychiatrist testify to all
the things that are in your -- in your brief, and in fact
the -- it would be another argument, but maybe the --
maybe the finding was deficient on that ground as well.
MR. WAXMAN: Well, we certainly could have had a
psychiatrist argue that in -- generally speaking,
adolescents are less mature and on a range of psychosocial
factors, they --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he could have cited all
the -- all the authorities you cite in your brief.
MR. WAXMAN: Right. But, Justice Kennedy, I --
I concede that.
The issue for this Court is whether the
Constitution requires that as a matter of law, not as a
matter of the application of law to a particular
defendant, the line has to be drawn this way, and --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose that all of
the things set forth in your brief were eloquently set
forth by a psychiatrist to the jury. Could the jury then
weigh these things that you're telling us?
MR. WAXMAN: The jury could have weighed these
things, but there is no way, even for a psychiatrist or a
psychologist, much less a juror to -- to be confident
because of the inherent, documented transiency of the
adolescent personality. No psychiatrist and no juror can
say with confidence that the crime that was committed by a
16- or 17-year-old, on the average 2 years ago -- and this
is the key point -- proceeded from enduring qualities of
that person's character as opposed to the transient
aspects of youth, and therefore --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But now, that -- that
itself is a purported scientific fact, what you just said,
and it seems to me if we're -- if we're to rely on that,
it ought to have been tested in the way most facts are.
MR. WAXMAN: What the jury -- perhaps I'm not
understanding your point.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, you're -- you're
relying on factual -- the statement you just made was --
was a factual statement about the enduring character, et
cetera. Now, if -- if we are to take that as a fact, it
ought to have been tested somewhere rather than just given
to us in a brief.
MR. WAXMAN: Well, the -- the -- an argument to
the jury that regardless of what a psychiatrist or a
psychologist would have said about Christopher Simmons, as
a group, 16- and 17-year-olds have such labile
personalities that it is impossible to know whether
they're -- the crime that they committed reflected an
enduring character is an argument that could have been
made to spare this particular defendant, but it need not
have been credited or given dispositive weight,
particularly since at sentencing -- and this Court has
acknowledged this in cases like Pate v. Robinson and Drope
v. Illinois -- the jury is evaluating somebody,
determining their moral blameworthiness 2 years later.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if you're reluctant
to give it dispositive weight in an individual case, then
you come in and ask us to give it dispositive weight as a
general rule, that seems to me inconsistent.
MR. WAXMAN: Well, no. What I'm -- what I'm
asking you to do -- what I'm suggesting is that the weight
of scientific and medical evidence of which the Court can
take judicial notice and should take judicial notice and
did take judicial notice in cases like Atkins and Thompson
and Stanford explains and validates the consensus that
society has drawn. We're not arguing that the science or
what a particular neurobiologist or developmental
psychologist says dictates the line of 18. The question
is we have a consensus. It's even more robust than it was
in Atkins. Looking at proportionality and reliability
with respect to that consensus, is there a good,
objective, scientific reason to credit the line that
society has drawn?
And I'm suggesting two things. Number one, that
although one could posit that there are 16- and 17-year-
olds whose antisocial traits are characterological rather
than transient, we know it is impossible -- we know this
from common sense and it's been validated by science, of
which the Court can take note, that it is impossible to
know whether the crime that was committed by a 16- or 17-
year-old is a reflection of his true, enduring character
or whether it's a manifestation of traits that are
exhibited during adolescence. And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose -- suppose I --
I were not convinced about your scientific evidence was
conclusive and I don't identify a clear consensus. Do you
lose the case, or can you then make the same argument you
just made appealing to some other more fundamental
principle that Stanford was just wrong?
MR. WAXMAN: Here -- no. Well -- no. Here's
what I would appeal to. I -- there are three relevant
factors that this Court has to look at. There's the
determination of consensus. Is there enough of a one or
isn't there? There's the determination of
proportionality, and then there's the issue identified in
Lockett and in Atkins, which is how reliable is the
individualized sentencing process. How reliably -- when
we're talking about picking the tiny few who are the worst
of the worst, how reliably can we do that? We think that
with respect to each of those, we have demonstrated that
the Eighth Amendment requires recognizing 18.
But I will take as a posit your hypothetical
question that I haven't convinced you on number one,
number two, or perhaps individually on all three. This is
truly a case, Justice Kennedy, in which the whole is
greater than the sum of the parts. Taken together, the
fact that it's impossible for a jury to know whether the
crime of an adolescent was really the feature of an
enduring character, since we know, as in Atkins, that many
of the characteristics that manifest themselves in mental
retardation also affect the inability of adolescents to
communicate with their attorneys, to express remorse, that
2 years later when this person is on trial, physically,
emotionally it's not the same person that the jury is
looking at and being asked to evaluate --
JUSTICE BREYER: So that -- that's
-- that last point was what I thought the scientific
evidence was getting at, that it simply confirmed what
common sense suggests, that when you execute a person 15
or sometimes 20 years later, a problem always is that that
person isn't the same person who committed the trial in a
meaningful sense. And it's specially true of 16- and 17-
year-olds who, observation would suggest, have a lot of
changing to do because their personality is not fully
formed.
Now, I thought that the -- the scientific
evidence simply corroborated something that every parent
already knows, and if it's more than that, I would like to
know what more.
MR. WAXMAN: Well, it's -- I think it's -- it's
more than that in a couple of respects. It -- it
explains, corroborates, and validates what we sort of
intuitively know, not just as parents but in adults that
-- that -- who live in a world filled with adolescents.
And -- and the very fact that science -- and I'm not just
talking about social science here, but the important
neurobiological science that has now shown that these
adolescents are -- their character is not hard-wired.
It's why, for example -- here's a -- here's an interesting
and relevant scientific fact. Psychiatrists under the
DSM, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is their
Bible, are precluded from making a diagnosis of antisocial
personality before the age of 18 precisely because before
the age of 18, personality and character are not fixed
even with respect to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, I -- I thought we
punish people, criminals, for what they were, not for what they
are. I mean, you know, if you have someone who commits a
heinous crime and by the time he's brought to trial and
convicted, he's come to Jesus, we don't let him off
because he's not now what he was then. It seems to me we
punish people for what they were.
MR. WAXMAN: We --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And to say that adolescents
change, everybody changes, but that doesn't justify
eliminating the -- the proper punishments that society has
determined.
MR. WAXMAN: I think, with respect, Justice
Scalia, I'm not -- I think that there is an interesting
question about -- with respect to death, whether what they
are and what they will become is totally irrelevant.
But accepting the premise of your question, my
point is that science has confirmed what we intuitively
know, which is that when the jury gets around to
evaluating what the character was that manifested that
horrible crime, they can't tell because of the passage of
age and because of a number of confounding factors and
because psychologists and psychiatrists can't tell
themselves whether the crime that occurred 2 years ago or
2 weeks ago was the manifestation of an enduring character
or transient psychosocial traits that rage in adolescence.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Is part of your answer
based on the length of time between the killing and the
trial?
MR. WAXMAN: Only part, Mr. Chief Justice. Part
of it is that the jury, of course, is looking at the
defendant, and we have laid before the Court peer-reviewed
scientific studies that show that they -- that people are
-- frequently equate maturity and psychosocial development
with race and with physical appearance. In addition,
because the adolescent personality is transient and the
lapse of time for trial is 2 years, in a very real sense
psychosocially as opposed to -- in addition to physically,
the person that the jury is judging is not the -- is not a
manifestation of the person who committed the crime.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, what if -- what
if a State said I see the problem, so we'll bring this
person to trial in 6 weeks?
MR. WAXMAN: Even if it were in 6 weeks, Mr.
Chief Justice, we believe that the process is -- is
sufficiently -- that would just make the youth the same as
the mentally retarded, because the mentally retarded have
stable personalities and stable characters, and yet, what
this Court said in Atkins was we have two things to say.
One is that overwhelmingly as a group the mentally
retarded are unlikely to be among the very worst of the
worst, and the very deficits that they have -- that you
called deficits in reasoning, judgment, and control of
their impulses, makes the jury -- the process of the jury
evaluating the moral culpability, the moral
blameworthiness unreliable. And it's on the basis of
those two things that we think that the consensus that's
otherwise reflected is validated. And here --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have -- I have one other
question I'd like to ask because it's been troubling me
and I want your comment.
A number of juveniles run in gangs and a number
of the gang members are over 18. If we ruled in your
favor and this decision was given wide publicity, wouldn't
that make 16-, 17-year-olds subject to being persuaded to
be the hit men for the gangs?
MR. WAXMAN: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm very concerned
about that.
MR. WAXMAN: I -- I am also concerned about it,
and I -- I have thought about this. First of all, if they
are enlisted by people over the age of 18 to do that, the
-- the precise degree of culpability goes to the people
who are over 18, and juries ought to consider whether
people who are over the age of 18 have so enlisted them.
But even -- but with respect to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about the
deterrent value of the existing rule insofar as the 16-
and 17-year-old. If -- if we rule against you, then the
deterrent remains.
MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think -- I think, as with
the mentally retarded, or in fact, even more than with the
mentally retarded, adolescents -- the -- the role of
deterrence has even less to say, precisely because they
weigh risks differently and they don't see the future and
they are impulsive and they're subject to peer pressure.
And in fact, if you look at what happened in
this case, it's as good an example as any. The State
says, well, okay, you know, he -- you know, this guy,
according to the State's witness, the person, who was over
18 and described as the Fagin of this group of juveniles,
testified to the court, well, Christopher Simmons says,
let's do it because, quote, we can get away with it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there were a number -- a
number of cases in the Alabama amicus brief, which is
chilling reading -- and I wish that all the people that
sign on to the amicus briefs had at least read that before
they sign on to them -- indicates that often the 17-year-
old is the ringleader.
MR. WAXMAN: Well, the 17-year-old may be the
ringleader, and even if you posit that Christopher Simmons
was the ringleader here, he -- he wasn't under any
illusions. He wasn't making a statement about being
executed. He said, we could get away with it, which
speaks volumes about the -- the extent to which -- this
guy was subject to life without parole, which is, Justice
Scalia, fundamentally different than death. This Court
has said that only when the penalty is death, do you look
at the character of the defendant as opposed to the nature
of the crime and the act.
But the data shows -- and I think this Court has
acknowledged -- it acknowledged in Thompson in any event
-- that the -- that adolescents like the -- the mentally
retarded are much less likely to be deterred by the
prospect of an uncertain, even if probable, very
substantial penalty. The -- no mature adult would have
thought, as Chris Simmons reportedly said, I can get away
with this because I'm 17 years old, when the mandatory
punishment for him would have been life in prison.
It's -- it is not -- eliminating the death
penalty as an option, which is -- which is imposed so
rarely as to be more freakish than the death penalty was
in Furman -- three States in the last 10 years, one --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But of course, the death
penalty was not a deterrent for any of the crimes
described in the Alabama brief because those are all --
crimes all occurred in States which execute people under
18.
MR. WAXMAN: Yes, and I -- and I -- the -- the
examples in the Alabama brief are horrifying. But if you
look at those examples, the very first one, this is a kid
who went on a killing spree, including his father, because
he felt he was unjustly deprived use of the family truck.
And there -- I can go through the other examples, but
these are posited as people who a jury could, with a
degree of reliability that the Constitution requires, say
acted out of a stable, enduring character rather than
transient aspects of youth? I think that's a poster child
for us.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Whereas if it had been done by
an 18-year-old, a jury could have said that.
MR. WAXMAN: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If an 18-year-old did the same
thing, you say, well, he's certainly stable.
MR. WAXMAN: May I answer? Briefly.
The line -- the science shows what common sense
understands which is that development is a continuum, but
the line, 18, is one that has been drawn by society.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.
MR. WAXMAN: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Layton, you have 8
minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. LAYTON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LAYTON: Mr. Simmons, of course, was found
by the jury to be the ringleader. And in essence, that
creates a contrast with the Lee Malvo case where we had
something like what Justice Kennedy referred to, adults
influencing a juvenile, and the jury was able to make that
distinction in the Virginia Lee Malvo case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, Mr.
Layton? This case kind of raises a question about the
basic State interests that are involved here, and the
State interests that justify the death penalty include
deterrence and also retribution.
MR. LAYTON: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Which, if either, of those do
you think is the primary State interest you seek to
vindicate today?
MR. LAYTON: I -- I think that they are of equal
weight in the minds of the legislators in the State of
Missouri.
The -- Mr. Simmons' counsel comes to the edge of
asking this Court to --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask one further?
MR. LAYTON: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any evidence that the
death penalty for those under 18 or even above has, in
fact, had any deterrent value?
MR. LAYTON: From all that I have read, the
evidence both directions is inconclusive, Your Honor, and
thus, subject to legislators' determination.
Mr. Simmons' counsel comes to the edge of asking
the Court to elevate proportionality to be equivalent to
-- to a consensus. But let me just highlight two aspects
of the non-capital case proportionality jurisprudence of
this Court.
Justice Kennedy, in -- in Harmelin recently
cited by the plurality in Ewing, pointed out that two of
the considerations in proportionality review in those
instances are the primacy of the legislature and the
nature of the Federal system. What we should have here is
a principle that is a principle dealing with immaturity,
and the States, within the Federal system, should be able
to make the determination as to how to implement it.
As pointed out, this Court's jurisprudence in
Eighth Amendment areas has proven to be a one-way ratchet,
and because of that, the Court has to be very wary of
leading rather than reflecting societal norms. Now, there
are some States, of course, that have raised the age, the
minimum age, for capital punishment, but at least in some
instances, such as Missouri, that is a reaction to this
Court's jurisprudence, that is, a reaction to Thompson and
Stanford. Other States have left 18 for other purposes,
and yet there still is a role by this Court.
Pornography is an example. I am confident that
but for this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, the
Missouri General Assembly would adopt a statute that said
that pornography should not be allowed at ages much higher
than 18 and not because of maturity, but because of their
opposition to pornography.
In many of the instances cited by Mr. Simmons,
the kind of statutes that he cites, gambling and others,
it is a compromise in the legislative arena, not
necessarily based on maturity or immaturity, that leads to
the selection of the age of 18. Many States have, of
course, individualized determinations with regard to those
statutes. There was a discussion of driver's licenses.
In Missouri, of course, we allow people to drive at age
15. They have to have parental consent, yes, but there
also is a test. That is, there is an individualized
determination before we do that, and that's what the State
requests here.
Mr. Simmons' counsel points out that in Atkins
the Court took judicial notice of psychosocial evidence,
and that's true. The Court did. But remember that what
the Court had before it in Atkins was not a proxy for a --
a factor that plays into culpability. It was, in fact,
the factor itself, that is mental capacity. And what they
want here is not a determination as to the maturity or the
capacity of individuals. They want a bright line test
that is based purely on age.
This Court should adopt, as it did in Atkins, a
principle and leave it to the States to act. That's what
the Court did in --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, one -- one of the
objections in -- in Atkins was we needed a bright line
test. We'd have difficulty determining which ones are
mentally retarded. Here we don't have that problem at
all. I guess everybody knows whether or not the defendant
is over or under 18.
MR. LAYTON: Well, if that's the bright line.
We don't know whether they're mature or immature, and we
have to measure that somehow.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the -- but the purpose of
a bright line test is to avoid litigation over the
borderline cases, and you just have completely avoided
that in this category.
MR. LAYTON: Because the -- having a bright line
test means that the individual who murders at age 17, 364
days is treated differently than a more -- a less mature
individual who is 2 days older.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it's an equally arbitrary
line if it's 16, 17, or 15.
MR. LAYTON: Yes, it is, and it's an arbitrary
line that the legislatures have set because it's a
legislative type determination based on what even Mr.
Waxman called legislative facts.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one -- have you read
the brief of the former U.S. diplomats in the case?
MR. LAYTON: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think we should give
any credence whatsoever to the arguments they make?
MR. LAYTON: No.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE STEVENS: The respect of other countries
for our country is something we should totally ignore.
MR. LAYTON: That's not for this Court to
decide. Congress should consider that. The legislatures
should consider that. It's an important consideration,
but it is not a consideration under the Eighth Amendment.
JUSTICE STEVENS: We should leave it up to the
legislature of the State of Missouri to resolve those
questions.
MR. LAYTON: Within the parameters of -- of
Thompson and Stanford, yes. Yes.
The Missouri Supreme Court -- the Atkins v.
Virginia -- in Atkins v. Virginia, this Court did not
authorize the Missouri Supreme Court to reject Stanford.
The Court should refuse to -- to sanction such activity by
the lower courts and continue the course it set in that
decision.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Layton.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in the
