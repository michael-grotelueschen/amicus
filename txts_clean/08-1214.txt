CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear argument
next this morning in Case 08-1214, Granite Rock
Company v. the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
Mr. Mathiason.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARRY G. MATHIASON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MATHIASON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
This case involves two questions. Taking
them in the order that the Ninth Circuit addressed
them, we look first at whether the complaint contained
sufficient facts to support a cause of action against
a non-signatory international union that engages in a
company-wide strike that violates the no-strike clause
of a contract between the local and the employer.
This is not a strike for higher wages,
better benefits; it's a strike for an amendment to the
contract that would provide immunity for the
international and other locals with regard to past
wrongdoing. The --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a tort action,
right?
MR. MATHIASON: It is a tort action by being
structured as inducement and interference. It is
grounded in contract. Specifically, what you would
look for, for jurisdiction, is to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose --
grounded in contract. I suppose the existence of a
contract is an evidentiary matter that you have to
establish, but the cause of action is still tort, and
of course 301(a) is limited to violations of
contracts.
MR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, 301(a) provides
jurisdiction if there's a suit for a breach -- if
there's a suit for violation of a contract, and that
can be between a nonparty and a party, and then the
contract is between the union and the employer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see how
somebody who is not a party to the contract can
violate the contract. They can be liable for all
sorts of things, but I don't see that they can be
liable for violating the contract.
MR. MATHIASON: Mr. Chief Justice, the
concept that we are advancing is the plain language of
the statute. Violation of a contract is right at the
heart of this suit. You have for 150 years,
jurisprudence where in enforcing contracts, which is
the central mission of the statute, there --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose you can
have tortious interference with the contract. Can
you, without the -- establishing the existence of a
contract?
MR. MATHIASON: I can't imagine how you
would. You might have a different --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I suppose
that’s --
MR. MATHIASON: -- kind of tort.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- tortious
interference with -- what is it, the ability to enter
into a contract, I think, is recognized in some
jurisdictions.
MR. MATHIASON: That's -- that's cognizable.
That's certainly not here.
What we’re doing is looking at a very minor
adjustment in what would otherwise be a
straightforward contract action; and that is that you
have a situation where the international displaced the
local after the contract was entered into, took
control, and that control we manifested in several
specific points within our complaint. And another way
-- it's effectively an agency relationship between the
-- at that point between the international and the
local, but it's an agency relationship to control them
to effect the breach.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, then you could have
sued on an agency claim, couldn't you?
MR. MATHIASON: We did originally look at an
agency claim. The problem with that is that under an
agency claim, at the time the contract was formed,
it's clear the local was not operating on behalf of
the international. It was --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I mean -- if
you’re coming up and saying, well, we have a
principal-agent here, I could understand that, but
that's I didn't think the question we are here to
decide.
MR. MATHIASON: The question to decide is
whether there’s a cause of action.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: On -- on the tortious
interference as to whether or not that's under 301.
Sure, agent-principal, I understand that. But that --
that's a new argument so far as I'm concerned.
MR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, that argument
really isn’t new at all. With regard --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it your briefs? Is it
part of the question?
MR. MATHIASON: It is in our briefs. It is
directly in our briefs. With regard to a footnote, we
actually say that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the -- the basic
question is -- the Chief Justice began with it --
isn't this -- isn't this a tort action? You say,
well, it's grounded in contract. I -- I really have a
problem with the word "grounded." If you say it
necessarily implicates or it's entangled, then I could
understand that. But grounded in contract -- we ask
what the source of the original obligation is. And
these parties were not -- or the international was not
part of the -- part of the -- part of the contract.
MR. MATHIASON: We take the position that
the contract has within it the protection of the
contract. In other words, if you have a party that is
in a position to control one of the signatories to the
contract and they cause that signatory to breach the
contract, and -- then in every regard that is the
equivalent of a violation of contract. They are the
responsible party. They -- to --
JUSTICE BREYER: So suddenly it's all a lot
of things that would have been pre-empted to go to the
board. For example, you have a labor dispute on a
construction business, and one union's out there
telling the other: Keep on going. And then some
other group comes in and says: Don't let them do that
to you. And another says: You don't have to do that
under your contract. And there are 19 unions and they
are all fighting about -- each other, and everybody is
going to end up suing each other in Federal court.
I thought the purpose of the LMRA was to
stop that. The purpose of the Labor Act, the Wagner
Act was to stop that. They didn't want Federal courts
any more than State courts interfering in that kind of
thing. So why should we read an exception into this?
MR. MATHIASON: Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: It would reproduce the
situation that led all the Congresses and Presidents
in the 1930s to stop it.
MR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, the very essence
of section 301 was to deal with midterm contract
strikes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's right, and they
said: Here's how we’ll deal with that. We’ll deal
with that by giving the employer and the union a right
to go into court and enforce the contract or get
damages for its violation. That we figure furthers
labor relations.
But it's pretty hard for me to see how it
could further labor relations by letting any third
party under the sun come in and say everything that
went on during a labor dispute is a -- is a tort in
respect to the contract that might not even have been
signed yet.
MR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, what you have
just described in terms of the impact on labor
relations is exactly what we are focused on here.
This is not any party. This is the international that
effectively displaces, takes control, tells the
employer that they have the independent ability to
resolve the dispute --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are not arguing us
creating Federal common law for tortious interference.
You are saying they’re the actual party to the
contract. So which theory are you -- are you arguing?
MR. MATHIASON: We originally made the
argument that they were -- they were the moving party,
the undisclosed principal, that actually caused the
contract to come into existence. We can't factually
support that. They were upset with the decision to
enter into the contract.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you've given up the
agency argument?
MR. MATHIASON: We abandoned it only with
regard to formation. We absolutely did not and do not
abandon that argument thereafter for the breach.
Thereafter, what happened is you have the
international taking control of the local and causing
the local to breach the contract. And that
differentiates it from many, many other circumstances
where you have third parties.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me the
strongest argument you have is that this tortious
interference is pre-empted under State law. So we
have a -- a vacuum if we don't accept -- accept your
view.
Let me ask you this: My understanding is --
correct me if I am wrong, please -- this Court has not
said that they -- that the State law cause of action
for interference with contract relations is pre-
empted. This Court has not said that. Am I correct
about that?
MR. MATHIASON: This Court would --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The circuits have said
that, but we haven't said that. Am I right about
that?
MR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, with all due
respect, I think this cause of action would clearly be
pre-empted under Allis-Chalmers and subsequent
decisions.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. I’m talking --
I’m talking specifically that -- interference with
advantageous business relations or interfering with an
existing contract -- that, we have not addressed in
this Court.
MR. MATHIASON: In Allis-Chalmers, the Court
did address the pre-emption doctrine and indicated
that it would extend to torts.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but it did not --
it did not include interference with a -- with a
contractual relation. We have not, as a specific
holding -- tell me if I’m wrong. I will look at
Allis-Chalmers.
MR. MATHIASON: No, Your Honor, I think
you're correct, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Allis-Chalmers involved the
two parties to the contract, a tort claim by one party
to the contract against the other party to the
contract, right?
MR. MATHIASON: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And this involves a tort
claim by one party to the contract against a third
party. It seems to me it's quite -- quite different
from Allis-Chalmers.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it would seem to me
that one of your strongest points is that this is pre-
empted by State law. If -- if that's not true, then
we would be deciding the case based on a premise that
is -- is unclear.
MR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, we have taken
the strong position that it is pre-empted by 301. It
will involve an interpretation of the contract and an
application of the contract. To view that as
otherwise not pre-empted would be to start attacking
1 in terms of a uniform national system of
administering contracts in Federal labor law.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what is -- what is
the contractual issue? What is the issue of
interpreting the contract that this case presents if
you let the 301 case go forward?
MR. MATHIASON: The issue would be whether
the action of engaging in the strike violates the no-
strike clause of the collective bargaining agreement.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any dispute about
that?
MR. MATHIASON: I think there is a dispute
about that. I think there’s a dispute about the
underlying existence of the contract, and then the --
the no-strike clause is complex.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is that issue still
alive? Wasn't there an NLRB order in May of '06 that
said -- or directed that the contract become effective
as of July 2nd?
MR. MATHIASON: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did anybody appeal that
order or challenge it?
MR. MATHIASON: Yes. That order was
appealed to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit
affirmed it. From our perspective, it's a final
determination that July 2nd is the starting date of
the contract. However, you still have a formation
issue.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So did -- but how -- if
you lost in your appeal to the Ninth Circuit and the
contract is effective July 2nd, what issue remains for
anybody to decide with respect to contract formation?
MR. MATHIASON: We --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because there has been a
final adjudication of the question of the effective
date of the contract.
MR. MATHIASON: That's our position. We
succeeded on that issue before the Ninth Circuit.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now the only question
that appears to be extant in my mind is whether or not
there was a breach of the no-strike clause. So why
isn't that subject to arbitration by the very terms of
the arbitration clause?
MR. MATHIASON: We agree that that would go
to arbitration, and it's scheduled to go to
arbitration between the local and the company. The
second question that was brought to play in this
particular case is whether the formation question goes
to an arbitrator or goes to --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but what -- there is
no doubt about the formation, just as Justice
Sotomayor said. There is a contract, the contract
that was signed on December 17th. It is formed. You
don't doubt that it's formed. They don't doubt that
it's formed. And that contract has an arbitration
agreement in it. And one of the questions that will
be arbitrated, I take it, is whether that December
th contract, because of its retroactivity
provisions, provides damages for what happened in
July. And part of that will require the arbitrator to
interpret the December 17th contract --
MR. MATHIASON: Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- to decide whether it
does cover that event of July 2nd. Now, what has this
got to do -- I mean, I would have thought -- is that -
- I mean, what is your argument?
MR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, the critical
issue isn't the NLRB ruling, although that’s going to
have to be drawn upon. There is a denial that a
contract was formed on July 2nd that continues to
today. And the question is: Where does that get
decided? Does it get decided in a court, as we did
before with a unanimous jury verdict? Or does that
now get vacated and sent to an arbitrator with no
agreement --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why is there -- is
there anything, any question about formation, given
that there is a contract? The contract is retroactive
to May, so if the contract is retroactive to May, then
certainly a contract was formed and that issue is --
is academic, but --
MR. MATHIASON: You're -- Justice Ginsburg,
this is right at the center of the analysis in that we
contend, the company, that there was a formation on
July 2nd. The other side contends that something
happened on August 22nd that would constitute the
formation event. There was no -- if our contract --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why does it matter?
Why does it matter if we have a contract? A contract
has been formed; everybody agrees about that. And
everybody agrees that the effective date is May.
MR. MATHIASON: It's of critical importance
which contract was formed, because there’s a quid pro
quo in labor law that's critical, and that is that you
agree to arbitration in exchange for a no-strike
clause. That happened on the 2nd. If we had not had
formation on July 2nd and the first formation was on
the 22nd of August, then we would have been denied all
of the benefit of the contract. We never would have
made the same deal.
JUSTICE BREYER: So, why isn’t --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it's a
question for your friends on the other side whether
they think the ratification or the contract that was
entered into in December that’s effective in May -- if
that makes them liable for violating the no-strike
clause, right?
MR. MATHIASON: Mr. Chief Justice, there’s a
critical issue in labor relations, and that is clearly
when it's ratified brings into effect the no-strike
clause. That's embedded --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what happens if
it's ratified retroactively? Is the no-strike clause
in effect?
MR. MATHIASON: The no --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want to say yes,
right?
MR. MATHIASON: Well, it would be -- it
would be completely imprudent for to us say that in
May the no-strike clause was in effect. It wasn't,
because the parties were still in a labor dispute and
negotiating. July 2nd, that's when the no-strike
clause came into effect.
JUSTICE BREYER: I think people are not
communicating. Imagine on December 17th you and I
enter into a contract and it's all written in red, all
right? And one of these red sentences says: I will
pay you $32 extra an hour from the moment that the
blue contract went into effect. See?
Now, whether -- that moment when the blue
contract went into effect is a question, isn't it,
that we would turn over to the arbitrator, the person
who is arbitrating the meaning and application of the
red contract. That's simply a question of fact and
contractual meaning like any other.
Now, what have I said that's wrong?
MR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, what's really
central is the fact that when we signed in December,
we signed the agreement of July 2nd. That is
critical. If there had been no ratification on July
nd, there would be no contract. And when the union
signed, they take the position that they signed a
contract ratified on August 22nd. Those are radically
different events, and the -- the real issue then is,
where do you determine this core initial issue?
JUSTICE BREYER: Why is that a difficult
issue? I can easily modify the hypothetical. The red
contract says: Joe Smith will be paid $32 extra an
hour from the moment when this red contract takes
effect.
Okay? And, now we have an issue, when
everybody's agreed, we'll send the meaning of the
contract to arbitration. We’ll send the application
of the contract to -- to arbitration. One of the
questions is: When, for purposes of the $32, did this
contract, which we have admittedly signed, take
effect? Why isn't that question for an arbitrator?
Is there any authority at all --
MR. MATHIASON: Yes --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- anywhere that says it
isn't -- I can't -- I can't even know what authority -
- what reasoning it would be.
MR. MATHIASON: Justice Breyer, the second
contract, if it's the contract as proposed by the
other side, never would have had a clause with that
much money in it because we would have had to absorb
for the strike. We signed the contract on the
assumption that it was the contract entered into July
nd, and --
JUSTICE ALITO: Am I correct that neither
you, neither Granite Rock nor the local, thinks that
the December collective bargaining agreement really
was fully retroactive? They don't think it was --
MR. MATHIASON: That's correct.
JUSTICE ALITO: -- it meant that the no-
strike clause was in effect on the day when the old
collective bargaining agreement expired, and you don't
think that the new arbitration clause was in effect on
the day when the old collective bargaining agreement
expired, or do I not understand your positions?
MR. MATHIASON: Justice Alito, that’s
exactly right. We agree with that. It wasn't. I
mean, there is a crystal-clear understanding between
the parties that the time of ratification is the time
that the no-strike clause came into effect, and if
there was no ratification on July 2nd, we wouldn't
have signed the contract with the wage levels that are
described in December. When we signed it, we signed it
with the assumption that it was the contract that was
formed on July 2nd.
And the issue of formation was never given
to arbitration. The arbitration clause in this
particular case is what arises under the contract.
It's a much narrower clause than this Court has seen
in other cases and was not submitted --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I keep going back
to: That issue was decided. It was decided by the
NLRB, and that was affirmed by a court of law, and so
-- by the Ninth Circuit. I don't understand what the
extant issue is. The -- the -- now what's left is
applying that in arbitration to the question of the
effectiveness of the no-strike clause.
But it has nothing to do with whether or not
the issue of ratification has been decided and by
whom.
MR. MATHIASON: Justice Sotomayor, we take
the position, much like you've indicated in your
hypothetical or actual description, that the NLRB
decision is definitive. But there has to be a body,
an entity, that actually adjudicates whether this is
preclusive, and the question is: Does that go to a
court, as it already has, with a unanimous jury
verdict finding that it was ratified, or does it go to
an arbitrator, who then looks at the NLRB decision and
says, I guess I am bound by it?
We never agreed to submit the formation
question to arbitration. There is no clear and
unmistakable agreement to do that, and so,
consequently, it's the forum issue of where that's
decided. We couldn't agree more that it's a futile
act. In other words, the contract is now final and
over, it starts on July 2nd, and we should go right
into the issue of whether there’s a breach of
contract.
But there’s this interim step because we
don't yet have agreement from the other side that that
issue is moot and resolved.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the contract had read,
not simply "claims arising under this contract," but
in addition said "including the formation or breach
thereof," if the -- if the arbitration clause had
included formation, then you would have no argument.
MR. MATHIASON: There would be no --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would go to the
arbitrator.
MR. MATHIASON: Justice Ginsburg, there’s no
question that the parties could agree to have
formation arbitrated if they do so in a clear and
unmistakable way. The problem that we have here -- we
agree with that -- the clause, if -- if the clause
included formation, then that issue would go to the
arbitrator. But the issue then becomes is there a
contract? And that's a threshold issue, that you have
to bring life to the agreement to get subject matter
jurisdiction.
JUSTICE BREYER: I thought of another way of
putting this because I am having a hard time with it.
You and I could do this, couldn't we? We could try to
enter into a contract on May 1, and who knows what
happens, we disagree about what happened, and by the
way that had an arbitration clause in it. Now,
whether -- since we disagree about it, that would go
to the judge, whether we formed that contract with its
arbitration clause, because everything's up in the
air.
A year later, we enter into another
contract, and what that contract says is, we are going
to arbitrate every dispute between us, including that
old dispute about whether there was that old contract,
okay? And we could do that, and then you would -- you
would certainly arbitrate the issue of contract
formation, even for the old one, because we said we
would do it, right?
MR. MATHIASON: If --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why isn't the
December 17th contract that second contract in respect
to the July 2nd?
MR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, if that had
been, let's say, 4 years later, and we entered into a
new contract willingly and getting the exchange, the
no-strike clause for the arbitration, and that new
contract said, this is going to deal with all past
disputes, including prior contracts, fine.
When we executed that contract in December,
we executed the contract that we believed was formed
in July. There is no meeting of the minds. In other
words, the union's execution was on a contract they
say was formed on the 22nd.
There is a major, major issue here, and that
is on July 2nd we made the concessions on wages,
working conditions, and the rest of it, with the
explicit understanding that it would be ratified at
that time. Stipulated fact number 16, I think it's in
the joint appendix 377, has that qualification in it.
If it wasn't ratified on July 2nd, then what
happened is it was withdrawn, it exploded, there was
nothing, there was nothing to be signed in December.
We only signed what was agreed to on July 2nd and
maintained that position because we believe we got the
benefit and the protection of a no-strike clause all
the way through that time period.
And so that is the critical distinction.
And now I couldn't agree more with this Court that
it's an academic exercise to go to either an
arbitrator or a court on whether it is in effect as of
July 2nd. We believe the NLRB decision is preclusive
in that regard.
But there is underneath it, there has to be
a forum. There has to be somebody to say that. If an
arbitrator got the case, looked at it, said, well, I'm
not sure I really agree with the NLRB, and I think I'm
going to decide it differently, and that then went to
review in a court, and the arbitrator made a mistake
of law, a mistake of fact, it's not completely clear
to me that we would be able to come back to this Court
and get it effectively changed.
We are saying that the issue of formation
was submitted to the court, it was litigated.
And I would like to very much, Chief
Justice, reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Bonsall.
ORAL EXAMINATION OF ROBERT BONSALL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
TEAMSTERS LOCAL 287
MR. BONSALL: Mr. Chief Justice, may it
please the Court:
I’d like to turn to some questions that were
just raised. This is not a question of whether there
is a contract dated July 2nd, nor is this a question
of whether there was a contract dated August 22nd.
Those are issues of contract ratification.
There is only one collective bargaining
agreement. That collective bargaining agreement was
attached as an exhibit to the employer's first amended
complaint. The trial court recognized this fact, in
joint appendix page 231.
The contract was attached to the -- to the
complaint lodging a breach of contract against this
labor organization. There can be no doubt that that
collective bargaining agreement says, on the very
first page and the very last page, that the effective
date is May 1st, 2004, and its expiration date is
April 30th of 2008.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if there was a
contract beginning May 22nd, then that included the
no-strike clause?
MR. BONSALL: The issue, Your -- Mr. Chief
Justice, would be whether the parties when they
entered into that agreement and made that entire
agreement retroactive to May 1st of 2004, whether the
parties intended that the retroactivity clause would
apply for all purposes to any disputes arising to the
parties. For example --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you don't
think -- I guess this is following up on Justice
Alito's question. You don't think it included the no-
strike clause --
MR. BONSALL: Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- for -- that would
apply to July 2nd?
MR. BONSALL: We contend that it would not,
and here's the reason why. If --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it doesn't
-- I'm sorry to interrupt you. But if it doesn't
include the no-strike clause and the question is
whether the July 2nd one does, all this talk about the
December agreement being retroactive to May is really
kind of beside the point.
MR. BONSALL: Well, I think that it’s
important for two reasons. First, factually, if the
Court places itself in the position of the parties on
July 1st, at that point in time some things are clear.
The union and its members have been out on strike for
approximately 3 weeks, and they have engaged in tough
negotiations at the bargaining table trying to reach a
new contract, because that old contract had expired
almost 2 months ago. And the parties reach a
tentative agreement on all the wages, hours, and terms
of conditions of employment. But then the parties
also incorporate a retroactivity clause, to make sure
that all these rights and benefits would inure to the
union members beginning May 1, the day after the last
contract expired.
The Court should ask itself that -- when the
union and its members are engaging in lawful,
protected, concerted activity, a strike, on July 1,
did they intend to convert that lawful economic
activity into a breach of contract?
JUSTICE ALITO: And you say no, but what do
you say about the -- but you say that the arbitration
clause was intended to be retroactive.
MR. BONSALL: Excuse me, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO: But you say that the
arbitration clause -- or do you? -- in the later -- in
the agreement that was ratified in December was
retroactive?
MR. BONSALL: No, I think --
JUSTICE ALITO: Neither one is retroactive?
MR. BONSALL: On July 2nd, as counsel has
indicated, there is a real dispute, a continuing
dispute, between the parties whether the contract was
ratified on July 2nd.
JUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that. I've
having difficulty -- can we just put the December --
in the view of both sides, can we just put the
December agreement aside? It has nothing to do with
the argument that's before us.
The argument before us has to do with the --
whether there was a ratification on July the 2nd.
MR. BONSALL: We think that the -- there is
only one contract, Your Honor. That contract was
executed on December 14th by management's
representative and December 17th by the union's
representative. That's the labor agreement. Now --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- I'm sorry,
but that's the central issue. Your friend says no, we
had a contract on July 2nd, and that's for the court
to determine, not the arbitrator, because it's a
question of formation.
MR. BONSALL: Well, the fact that counsel
has reiterated over and over again that this is a
question of contract formation -- in fact there is no
formation issue when the Court is being asked to
decide whether there is an arbitral issue. The Court
needs to look at the collective bargaining agreement;
and the contract that was in effect at the time that
the party -- the union -- made its demand for
arbitration clearly indicated that there was a
contract in place, and it contained a -- an -- excuse
me -- extremely broad arbitration provision, that
requires that all disputes -- all disputes arising
under the collective bargaining agreement would be
subject to the grievance and arbitration provision.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the
union's initial position was that there was no
agreement, and it refused to arbitrate. Isn't that
what -- wasn't the union's refusal to arbitrate what
precipitated this case?
MR. BONSALL: That is not correct, Your
Honor.
On July 26th of 2004, the union was
confronting a Boys Markets injunction that was being
sought by the employer. The issue before the trial
court was whether the union should be enjoined, its
strike should be enjoined. And counsel for the union
took the clear position that there was not a contract
in place at that time on July 26th, but even if there
was, the injunction should not issue because of this
Court's decision in Buffalo Forge.
The matter that was continuing to be an
issue in conflict did not arise under the collective
bargaining agreement because it involved other labor
organizations and essentially a back-to-work
agreement. So on July 26th, the union did take the
position that there was no contract, but the reason
why an injunction was not appropriate was because of
Buffalo Forge.
I don't know if that addresses --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that at that
time the union refused to arbitrate.
MR. BONSALL: No. There was no question
about arbitrating anything. The employer didn't ask
to have arbitration at all at the July 26th hearing.
The only question at that point in time was whether
there was ratification or not. The employer insisted
that the union's representative had made a
communication to the employer's representative that
the contract had been ratified.
Having the witnesses for both labor and
management in the courtroom, Judge Ware said, well,
I’ll take evidence regarding whether this
communication occurred. Did George Netto represent to
Bruce Woolpert that in fact a contract had been
ratified?
That was the very narrow issue decided by --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, at least now that we
have had the NLRB's -- the NLRB has weighed in and
said that there was a contract as of July 2nd, why
isn't that conclusive?
MR. BONSALL: We think that there's still an
issue that is being sent to the arbitrator, the breach
of contract and damages, but as a precursor to that,
we contend that the issue never should have been
litigated at all by the trial court about whether
there was formation, because there was no question of
formation at that time. It was only a question of
contract ratification, and that issue falls within the
scope of the broad arbitration provision under the
collective bargaining agreement. When we go back --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought you answered
Justice Alito "no," but I thought his question was a
very simple one. You’re taking the position, I think,
that there’s no dispute that on -- in December a
contract was formed.
MR. BONSALL: Correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was made retroactive
to a date before July. It started in May --
MR. BONSALL: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and it covers a time
frame.
MR. BONSALL: Uh-huh.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The dispute between the
parties is what that retroactivity under the contract
means and which provisions are in effect or not.
Isn't that what your argument is -- that this is not
contract formation; this is a question of -- of the
applicability of individual provisions to a set of
facts?
MR. BONSALL: Absolutely correct, Your
Honor. The employer is alleging that there is a
breach of the no-strike clause. The union is alleging
a defense to that allegation by asserting a merits-
based issue regarding whether, in a certain narrow gap
period, falling in between the effective date of the
contract --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your answer to
Justice Alito should have been: We are arguing that
the no-strike clause was not in effect, but we do take
the position that the arbitration clause was --
MR. BONSALL: That’s --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- made retroactive.
MR. BONSALL: That's exactly correct, Your
Honor. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what do you
expect the arbitrator to do? The arbitrator -- since
you agree that there’s a contract in effect --
MR. BONSALL: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the arbitrator is
not going to decide whether the contract is there or
not.
MR. BONSALL: He will not.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the contract has
a no-strike clause.
MR. BONSALL: That's correct, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you expect the
arbitrator to say you get the benefit of the contract
that lets me decide something, and even though there’s
a no-strike clause in the contract, you want the
arbitrator to say that no-strike clause is not
operative on July 2nd?
MR. BONSALL: We expect the arbitrator to
take a look at the facts that existed on July 2nd and
make a determination whether in fact at that point in
time the union has a meritorious claim that the
contract was not ratified, and therefore the no-strike
clause --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though -- I'm
sorry to interrupt you. But even though the later
agreement was that it would be retroactive?
MR. BONSALL: Absolutely. Both parties
openly negotiated and hammered out and had their
representatives sign a collective bargaining
agreement. The employer was entirely free, if it was
inclined to do so, to suggest that they would not sign
an agreement unless the union consented.
JUSTICE ALITO: So in substance, you -- you
think that the arbitrator would decide the issue of
contract formation, whether --
MR. BONSALL: No.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I thought you just
said that the arbitrator would decide whether there
was an agreement on July the 2nd.
MR. BONSALL: The arbitrator would not be
deciding contract formation. The arbitrator would be
deciding within the scope of the collective bargaining
agreement whether the no-strike clause was effective
to bind the employer -- excuse me -- to bind the union
from a short period of time from July 2nd to August
nd. That would be the only real claim, because the
union actually -- there’s no question -- was out on
strike. This is not in dispute.
What the trial court did in this case was to
usurp the function of the arbitrator. The parties
selected one arbitrator.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, perhaps you can
clarify one thing for me. I thought that these two go
together -- two things that go together: One is the
no-strike clause, and one is the arbitration clause.
MR. BONSALL: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you are trying to
uncouple them, and so, even though one is quid pro quo
for the other, you would say the union wants to keep
what favors it, that is the arbitration clause, but
reject what favors the employer, that is the no-strike
clause.
It seems to me that if you have one, you
have the other, but you can't say, oh, yes, we have
the arbitration clause, but we don't have the no-
strike clause.
MR. BONSALL: Yes, I -- I think this Court
has addressed that very issue, Justice Ginsburg, in
Drake Bakeries. An employer was confronted with a
strike. The employer immediately went into Federal
court and filed a breach of contract action against
the labor organization, and it insisted that these two
contract provisions, the right -- the no-strike clause
and the grievance procedure, were inextricably tied.
And this Court pointed out that they are not in all
circumstances exact counterweights.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they’re not in all
circumstances, but will you respond to your opponent's
argument? Why in the world would they have signed on
-- on July 2nd if they didn't think they were going to
get the benefit of the no-strike clause?
MR. BONSALL: When they signed the
agreement, Your Honor, they absolutely did get the
benefit of it. There was no strike at all after
August 22nd that was --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If they had the benefit of
the no-strike clause --
MR. BONSALL: -- in violation of the
collective bargaining agreement.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- then any subsequent
strike would have violated the contract?
MR. BONSALL: Absolutely. If there was a
subsequent strike at any time in --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, there was a
subsequent strike.
MR. BONSALL: There was not, Your Honor.
After -- after --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that an issue for
the arbitrator? Now that we know there was an
agreement on July 2nd, is the question whether the
strike continued or not for the arbitrator?
MR. BONSALL: I'm not sure that I understand
your question. The -- I think the arbitrator will be
--
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say there
was no strike, and I -- I thought the other side said
there was.
MR. BONSALL: There absolutely was a strike.
It began in the early weeks of June.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
MR. BONSALL: And it continued, actually,
through September 22nd of 2004. That was the duration
that the union was on strike.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, but their
position is that there was a contract on July 2nd that
included a no-strike clause --
MR. BONSALL: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that you
violated.
MR. BONSALL: That's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And your
answer is, one, that there is no contract, right?
MR. BONSALL: Our defense to the allegation
of the no-strike clause before the arbitrator would be
that at that time the parties had not ratified the
agreement, and that ratification did not occur until
August 22nd, which also appears as a concession by the
employer in paragraph 27 of their third amended
complaint. They also say that the contract was
ratified on August 22nd.
JUSTICE ALITO: But that would be an issue
for the -- you think that that would be an issue for
the arbitrator to decide, whether there was a contract
ratified on July the 2nd?
MR. BONSALL: Or August 22nd, yes, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO: And if the arbitrator
thought that it was in existence on July 2nd, then --
MR. BONSALL: Then --
JUSTICE ALITO: -- you would lose?
MR. BONSALL: I think that's correct, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO: So that's an issue of
contract formation; is it not? In substance it is.
MR. BONSALL: If I may finish?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, sure.
MR. BONSALL: In substance it's contract
formation if you can place yourself back in time on
July 2nd or August 22nd. It is moot and entirely
academic when the parties ratify an agreement at some
point in time and sign the contract in December.
There is no question of contract formation in this
case. There’s only a question of contract
ratification during a very narrow period.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that -- and that
position depends upon your answer to Justice
Ginsburg's question, that you are severing arbitration
and the no-strike obligation?
MR. BONSALL: Under Drake Bakeries, we do
not believe that we are severing at all. We think
that when an employer brings a breach of contract
claim in Federal court under a collective bargaining
agreement that contains a broad arbitration clause,
their remedy is to seek that breach of contract and
damage claim before the arbitrator.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. BONSALL: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Nussbaum.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. NUSSBAUM
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS
MR. NUSSBAUM: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
There are three basic points that I would
like to discuss with the Court this morning with
regard to the section 301 issue.
The first is that, in our view, the issue as
to whether or not a tort claim can be brought under
1 begins and ends with the clear language of section
1, which talks about suits for violation of
contract.
The second point I’d like to make is that
allowing the tort action, as Granite Rock is urging,
would work a big change in the structure that Congress
has established by which it has decided that major
issues of labor law, such as the weapons -- economic
weapons that parties can use, should be decided by
Congress through statute and by the National Labor
Relations Board through the application of the
statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you take the position
that the cause of action for interference with a
contract has been pre-empted insofar as State law is
concerned?
MR. NUSSBAUM: That's, of course, not an
issue in this case because it was never attempted --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your position on
that point?
MR. NUSSBAUM: The law in most of the
circuits is that any case which involves the
interpretation of a contract is pre-empted. I'm not
sure that this Court has --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you -- do you -- does
your client take the position that that law is
correct, that the Federal law has pre-empted State law
actions for interference with -- with contract
relations?
MR. NUSSBAUM: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So then you
are submitting to this Court that the purpose of the
National Relation -- Labor Relations Act and its
effect was to give immunity to unions for intentional
interference with contractual relations?
MR. NUSSBAUM: No, that is not what I
believe happened.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, isn't that the
effect of your argument here?
MR. NUSSBAUM: No, I do not believe it is.
Let me just first clarify something, that the pre-
emption of State torts is not dependent on section
1. State torts for interference with contract would
have been pre-empted prior, under Garmon or Machinists
pre-emption, because of those two doctrines, that it
would interfere with conduct that is arguably
prohibited or arguably protected, or that it is in an
area unregulated by Congress. But it doesn't leave
the employer remediless in a situation like this, far
from it.
This employer had a breach of contract
action under the contract that it is pursuing --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not against the
international?
MR. NUSSBAUM: Not against the
international. That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it's true -- if it's
true, which we can take for purposes -- for the
current purpose, that the international really did
induce the local to continue the strike, you said
there's no action in State court because that's pre-
empted. Unfair labor practice proceedings is against
the local, not the -- not the international. So
there's nothing.
It is in your view, you -- you said, well,
there’s relief against the local, but there’s no
remedy at all against the international, even if the
allegation is true that this strike would never have
occurred if it hadn't been for the pressure from the
international.
MR. NUSSBAUM: No, I disagree. There is an
avenue that Granite Rock could have pursued but did
not pursue, and that was to have filed a charge
against the international with the National Labor
Relations Board, which is the body that should be
making this precise decision as to whether this action
by the international, an economic weapon, is
permissible or is outlawed by the National Labor
Relations Act. Granite Rock chose not to file an
unfair labor practice, but it could have.
And we cited -- it's cited, actually, in the
amicus brief by the AFL-CIO, the Paperworkers case,
which demonstrates that an international union that
interferes with the bargaining of local unions can
itself be guilty of an unfair labor practice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'd like
your broader perspective as a representative of the
international, because I think it's an important issue
of labor policy. If I think that the cause of actions
available under 301(a) and the pre-emptive effect of
1(a) ought to be coextensive, which -- which do you
prefer, a broader 301(a) or a narrower pre-emption? I
think it makes a difference.
MR. NUSSBAUM: I'm not -- I'm sorry -- I'm
not sure I understand the question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think 301 -- I
think whatever -- I don't think there should be a no-
man's land between you can bring your action under 301
and it's pre-empted by 301.
In other words, if -- if you are right, that
they cannot bring a tortious interference action under
1, I don't think it should be pre-empted. If you
are wrong and they can bring it, then I can understand
that it should be pre-empted.
MR. NUSSBAUM: Let me -- let me try to
answer your question, as I'm -- as I'm understanding
it. First, the issue as to whether or not they could
bring a 301 action under -- a tort action under 301,
it was not pre-empted by 301.
The question is whether 301 allows that type
of claim at all, whether Congress intended that, and I
think the language of the statute, violation of
contract, indicates no, because a violation of
contract, you can only violate a contract against --
bring an action against someone who --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it was pre-empted
by 301, and they cannot bring it under 301?
MR. NUSSBAUM: Not a Federal court claim
under 301.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
MR. NUSSBAUM: A State claim, a State tort
action under 301, would be pre-empted. What will
happen then is -- is similar to what happened in the -
- in the Rawson case. What happens if a State court
tort is brought?
It would be pre-empted because of complete
pre-emption because it involves a contract and the
interpretation of a contract. That doesn't mean that
the -- that it's gone. What the Federal court does
then is look at the claim and say, with what was pled
in the complaint, does that fall within the parameters
of 301? And that's exactly what the Court did in
Rawson. It said the State court tort action was pre-
empted. Now, we have to look and see, is there a
claim under 301?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so if Granite
Rock brought this claim in State court, you would say
it's pre-empted by 301?
MR. NUSSBAUM: Yes, but we'd be in exactly
the same position.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then, if they
turned around and brought it in Federal court under
1, you would say, no, there is no cause of action
under 301?
MR. NUSSBAUM: Yes, you would get to the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.
MR. NUSSBAUM: You would get to the same
result, and the process is exactly the same.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it is in a no-
man's land. Their claim for tortious interference
with contract just can't be brought anywhere?
MR. NUSSBAUM: It -- it -- for tortious
interference, no, you cannot -- you cannot bring that
claim, but what I was saying before is, it doesn't
leave them remediless, even with regard to a claim
against the international because a charge could be
filed --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They could always go
to the NLRB --
MR. NUSSBAUM: -- under 8(b)(3), and the
board would decide, the -- the conduct in this
context, and the board is always looking at the
context of it, is this something which is prohibited,
something which is protected, something which is
unregulated? And it is the board that Congress
entrusted that -- that job to.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What remedies -- I'm
sorry.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What is the remedy --
JUSTICE BREYER: Just before you finish,
Chief, is it all right if you -- I'm not quite clear
on how this pre-emption works, and I perhaps didn't
have it right. But imagine 301 had never been
enacted. I thought, had that never been enacted,
certain kinds of State claims, particularly tort
claims of interference with labor contracts, for
example, might have been pre-empted anyway by the
Labor Relations -- by the -- by the LMRA.
I thought that did the basic pre-emptive
job. And then where it is pre-empted by the LMRA, 301
creates an exception to the pre-emption, so that it
isn't pre-empted, if you have a suit. Now, my
thinking is probably out-of-date and wrong, so I would
like you to explain how it works.
MR. NUSSBAUM: I -- I think perhaps we are
saying the same thing --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, because I think
that your response to the Chief Justice's question,
which is why I became uncertain, is that it is the
LMRA -- not the LMRA at all that pre-empts tort
actions and State activities that interfere with labor
relations, as this might. It is, rather, section 301
itself that pre-empts it, and then it is odd because
it pre-empts it, but it says, we won't give you any,
and -- and that's why I became uncertain.
MR. NUSSBAUM: Let me try because I think I
understand why I confused you. I think, before 301, a
tort action would have been pre-empted by either the
doctrines of Garmon pre-emption or Machinists pre-
emption.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In State court or in
Federal court?
MR. NUSSBAUM: In -- in State court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you bring it in
Federal court?
MR. NUSSBAUM: No -- well, no, it would have
been -- it would have been pre-empted in Federal court
also. It would have been within the primary
jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.
That's where -- who it goes to.
What I think has happened, Justice Breyer,
is, since the enactment of 301, and particularly with
this Court's doctrine of complete pre-emption for
removal purposes, which I know there’s some debate
about, when courts look at State law torts, they tend
to look at 301, rather than going back to Garmon and
Machinists pre-emption.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, what is the
remedy for an unfair labor practice? Can they get a
damage remedy?
MR. NUSSBAUM: Yes. It would be, first, a
cease-and-desist order.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.
MR. NUSSBAUM: And then a make-whole remedy.
JUSTICE STEVENS: A make-whole remedy --
MR. NUSSBAUM: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- for -- okay.
MR. NUSSBAUM: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would the make-
whole -- I gather a cease-and-desist wouldn’t make any
sense because this is over, but what would the make-
whole remedy entail?
MR. NUSSBAUM: It would have to be a proof
of damages that resulted from the unfair labor
practice, from the unfair conduct, which, in this
situation, would have been the interference into the
bargaining process. And how the NLRB would decide
what the damages would be, for the international as
opposed to the local union, I'm really not sure, but
there is certainly the capacity under the NLRA for
there to be a make-whole remedy.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- while saying that
there’s no cause of action for this tort claim, you
nonetheless say that the tort claim can be considered
an unfair labor practice by the labor board. Why does
that make any sense?
MR. NUSSBAUM: Because what Congress -- what
Congress did in 301 was to create limited jurisdiction
for one type of claim and one type of claim only,
violation of contract, breach of contract, an action
against the party that has the obligations under it.
But that doesn't mean that there isn't any
claim outside of 301 against a third party. In this
case, the third party is the international, and the
claim could be made under the National Labor Relations
Act. The Paperworker case is an example.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if it's outside 301,
where does pre-emption come from, Garmon?
MR. NUSSBAUM: The pre-emption -- well, in
this case --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I could interrupt just
for a moment? Allis-Chalmers was 301. Allis-Chalmers
says 301 covers contract, and, therefore, there’s a
pre-emption. So I take it you’re not talking about
Allis-Chalmers pre-emption. You are talking about
Garmon or Machinists or something.
MR. NUSSBAUM: Well, both of them end up
pre-empting a State law tort. In this case --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you say both of
them, then we’re back where we started. If 301 pre-
empts, then it should be within the ambit of 301's
jurisdiction to the Federal court.
MR. NUSSBAUM: No, it pre-empts exactly for
the purpose that this is an issue that should be
decided by the regulatory agency, which Congress
entrusted with making exactly these decisions. What
economic weapons can an international union, can a
parent employer use in a labor dispute?
For the courts to be getting involved in
that would be directly contrary to what Congress has
been doing since 1935, of saying those decisions of
economic weapons are not to be decided by courts
applying common law tort principles. We tried that,
and we didn't like it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that
applies in 301. They’re not touching the contract.
They’re not touching the parties to the contract.
This is outside the contract. So why should it be
pre-empted?
MR. NUSSBAUM: It's -- well, again, the
claim that they brought in Federal court was not pre-
empted. It was a claim. You looked at the claim.
You read the complaint, and you said, you don't have a
claim under 301 because it's not one for violation of
contract, good-bye.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that.
MR. NUSSBAUM: End of it. The question that
Justice Kennedy was -- was addressing to me was: Does
that leave them without any remedy? And my answer is,
no, it doesn't. Aside from the remedies they have
against the local, they also had a potential remedy
against the international through the National Labor
Relations Act.
And that -- that was the basic point that I
was making.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Has -- has the board, in
fact, declared a party who is not a party to the labor
contract guilty of an unfair labor practice in prior
cases?
MR. NUSSBAUM: The Paperworkers case that we
cite -- the answer to your question is: I'm not aware
of a case. The one we cited, the international was a
party to the case. However, it's clear that the fact
that it was a party to the case was not the
determinative factor, because what the NLRB did was
instruct the international union to strike the pooled
voting provision that was in the constitution.
So they didn't say: It's just no good in
this case where you are a party to the contract. They
said: You can't do it in any situation. That clearly
showed that the -- that the NLRB was focusing on the
broader type of interference where they didn't have to
be a party to the contract.
But even if the NLRB -- and I want to stress
this -- were to find that there wasn't a remedy under
the -- the facts of the particular case, that would
simply mean that it is protected conduct under the
National Labor Relations Act. And the NLRB has made
that decision, and it is the agency that should be
doing it, rather than having courts get involved in
this area of law making up rules, because when you
talk about interference, as we know, the tort isn't
for all interference; it's for improper interference.
As the Associated General Contractors
indicates, that would call into play the courts
looking at various factors such as societal values,
and that's exactly what Congress didn't intend.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. NUSSBAUM: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Mathiason, you
have 5 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARRY G. MATHIASON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MATHIASON: Categorically, Your Honor,
the NLRB has no jurisdiction over this case. In
footnote 18 of our reply brief, we recount the
history. That Paperworkers' case that was just
referenced, the international was a signatory. It was
the exclusive bargaining representative, and,
therefore, it had status under section 8(b)(3).
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Where is
that again? Footnote 18?
MR. MATHIASON: It’s footnote 18 of our
reply brief, and we recount the history that was
litigated both at the Ninth Circuit and beyond. There
is no remedy before the NLRB --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that may be, but then
you might have -- then you’d have a remedy in State
court. I think the argument was that -- anyway, I
have this argument: 301 doesn't pre-empt anything but
the contract claim.
Now, go bring your claim in State court.
You might have a good claim in State court that isn't
pre-empted. Suppose one of their employees hit
somebody over the head. You’d have a great claim, and
that isn't going to be pre-empted. Now, yours might
be, because there is a set of tort actions in State
court that the labor acts pre-empt; in particular,
those that involve conduct that is arguably protected
or arguably forbidden by the labor acts.
So, if you fall outside that category, you
are not pre-empted. And if you fall inside the
category, you should be pre-empted; not by 301, but by
the labor law which gave this kind of decision to the
labor board to make. What is -- is that argument
sensible? Is it right? What do you think?
MR. MATHIASON: Justice Breyer, there is a
fundamental aspect of that that’s just not right, and
that is that the conduct involved here was causing a
violation of a contract. The international took
control of the local and forced the breach. This is
the -- this conduct would never be sanctioned if the
jurisdiction of the NLRB had access to it, but the --
wisely, I think, the structure of the National Labor
Relations Board is -- the 8(b)(3) remedy is against an
exclusive agent. They have to be the bargaining
agent. International is not the bargaining agent.
And so, consequently, if we accepted the position
of the international, you would create a no-man's zone
that would apply throughout this country, whereby
collective bargaining agreements entered into by
locals could be destroyed, violated, by an
international that would choose to impose itself on
the local and cause that to happen. Most
internationals are responsible.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you seriously think
that if that becomes a problem, that the NLRB won't
declare it an unfair labor practice, or if they don't,
that they won't go to Congress and say: There is a
no-man's land; now give a remedy like you did in 301?
--
You’re -- you’re begging Justice Breyer's
question, which is: If the law pre-empts this claim
and it's doing so unjustly, who should make that
determination? Should it be you in a State court, you
in a Federal court, or should it be in the first
instance the NLRB who says this is or isn't an unfair
labor practice, and if it rules it's not because the
law doesn't cover it, or it's not authorized to issue
this --
MR. MATHIASON: Your -- Your Honor, I think
it's well-established this is not an unfair labor
practice, because you don't have jurisdiction under
section 8(b)(3).
What is suggested here is that maybe there
is a no-man's zone that Congress should go to and
regulate, but if you back up to 1947 and the passage
of section 301, it's inconceivable that in passing
that statute Congress intended to leave all
international unions, or anybody that controlled a
party, completely free from any reach of law.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why isn't it under
(b)(3)? How does 8(b)(3) read? What is it in
(b)(3) that would exclude this from the labor board's
MR. MATHIASON: Well, it is not an exclusive
representative. In other words, 8(b)(3) contemplates
a bargaining obligation on the part of an exclusive
representative, and the international is not in that
capacity.
They had control, but they aren’t designated
in that manner, and there’s not one NLRB case in the
history of that agency that deviates from that, or we
would have been on it immediately. And it just isn't
there.
So we were looking at our options, and State
court appeared to be very clearly pre-empted by Allis-
Chalmers and a row of cases. So that meant that the
Federal law, section 301, as suggested by Lincoln
Mills, would absorb.
Please recognize that what we are seeking
here -- the labels of tort and contract create, I
think, a false distinction. We are effectively
bringing a contract action for violation of a
contract. The linkage is strictly to add in the
international as the acting party.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
