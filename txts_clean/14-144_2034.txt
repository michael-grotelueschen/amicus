CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument first this morning in Case No. 14-144, John
Walker v. The Texas Division of the Sons of Confederate
Veterans.
Mr. Keller.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. KELLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Messages on Texas license plates are
government speech.  The State of Texas etches its name
onto each license plate and Texas law gives the State
sole control and final approval authority over
everything that appears on a license plate.  As in
Summum, Texas is not abridging any traditional free
speech rights.  Motorists remain free to speak in all
sorts of ways, including on their cars through a bumper
sticker right next to a license plate, or a car-size
paint job or a window decal.
But the First Amendment does not mean that a
motorist can compel any government to place its
imprimatur on the Confederate battle flag on its license
plate.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, one of -- one of
the problems with the scheme is it's a nebulous
standard:  Would it be regarded as offensive to many
people?  I mean, is it government speech to say "Mighty
fine burgers" to advertise a product?
MR. KELLER:  The government -- yes, Justice
Ginsburg.  The government is allowed to choose the
messages that it wishes to.  It's simply because it has
approved parochial messages or has endorsed messages or
is accepting and generating revenue.  To get -- to
propagate those messages doesn't defeat the fact that it
is government speech.
When the Library of Congress, for instance,
takes sponsorship from The Washington Post or Wells
Fargo for the National Book Festival, that's still a
government speech when they then put it on their
website.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose Texas erected 500
electronic billboards around the State, and on those
billboards they posted some government messages, wear
your seatbelt when you're driving, for example.  But
then at the bottom people could put a message of their
choice.  Would that be government speech?
MR. KELLER:  Justice Alito, I think the
portion that the government had final approval authority
and sole control over, that would be government speech.
If the government, though, doesn't have sole control or
final approval authority over another portion, I think
that could be --
JUSTICE ALITO:  No, the bottom, the
government has the same kind of approval authority that
it has here.  It'll allow people to say inoffensive
things, but if they say something that's -- that's
offensive, then they won't allow that.  That would be
government speech?
MR. KELLER:  It would be government speech
under -- I think the best reading of both Summum and
Johanns together is precedent; that you have final
approval authority when the government isn't abridging
other traditional free speech rights.
But even if that weren't the test --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But, I'm sorry.  I don't
understand.  Almost anything the government does, it has
final authority to veto.  Whether it's a school or a
government website, it always retains the authority to
say no.  The issue is when can it say no
constitutionally.
So I don't think it's merely that.  And in
Summum, the government actually created the words that
were -- that were being advertised.  So isn't that
substantially different?  Because the government's not
creating these words.
MR. KELLER:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, a few
points on Summum, the Court indicated that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the monument
case.  I'm talking about Johanns.
MR. KELLER:  That -- that -- that's right.
And in Summum though, the -- a private organization, the
Fraternal Order of Eagles, put its name on the monument.
It created the message; it then donated it to the park.
In Johanns, yes, the government did create a program to
espouse the message, "Beef, it's what's for dinner," but
even then, as the Court recognized the Secretary of
Agriculture didn't write ad copy.  So it's not as if the
government had control -- I'm sorry, the government had
control, it just was not at every step of the way saying
this is how the message must be, but at the end of the
day it had final approval authority.
But to return to Justice Alito's
hypothetical and what the test should be, the test can
include other elements.  And even if Summum and Johanns
could be read as just a two-part test, for all sorts of
reasons, this is government speech here.  Texas has its
name on every license plate.  There's a formal process
here of notice and comment, and the board takes a public
vote before approving any specialty license.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Keller --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do you want -- do
you want us to hold that because it's government speech,
the government can engage in viewpoint discrimination?
Is that what I'm supposed to write?
MR. KELLER:  That's right, Justice Kennedy.
And the Court has recognized that in Summum and in
Johanns.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And does that have any
limits, Mr. Keller?  I mean, suppose somebody submitted
a license plate to Texas that said, "Vote Republican,"
and -- and Texas said, yes, that's fine.  And then the
next person submitted a license plate to Texas and it
said, "Vote Democratic," and Texas said, no, we're not
going to approve that one.  What about that?
MR. KELLER:  Yeah, Justice Kagan, I don't
think our position would necessarily allow that, but I
think that doesn't have --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why -- why wouldn't it
allow that?
MR. KELLER:  Because the Establishment
Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, Due Process Clause,
other independent constitutional bars could apply.  As
Justice --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, this is not an
Establishment Clause issue.  So I'm -- I'm curious as to
why -- what -- what constitutional constraints you think
there are and how they would play out as to the kind of
hypothetical I just gave you.
MR. KELLER:  Absolutely, Justice Kagan.  I
think partisan speech, candidate speech, as Justice
Stevens' concurrence in Summum recognized and Justice
Scalia's concurrence in Finley recognized, there could
be other constitutional bars such as the Equal
Protection Clause.  The Oregon Supreme Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think all you have to say
is -- is whatever prevents Texas itself in all of its
other activities, never mind license plates, from saying
vote Republican, right?
MR. KELLER:  Absolutely.  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then you put the same
question:  What stops Texas from -- from saying, in all
of its election literature that it passes out, vote
Republican?  I think something prevents that.  And
whatever prevents that would prevent it on the license
plates, too.  No?
MR. KELLER:  That's correct, Justice Scalia,
which is why that issue is -- is one of government
speech in general.  But the Court has recognized
unanimously that the government can speak, that the
government speech doctrine does not allow -- or sorry,
that the government can speak even if it is going to
take certain viewpoints, and not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what -- what's the
-- what case do you want me to read to show that the
government can engage in viewpoint discrimination when
it's its own speech?  It's the monument cases?
MR. KELLER:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.  Summum
would be the best example.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is this -- is this a case
where the State, the government, has aided in creating a
new kind of public forum?  People don't go to parks
anymore.  If the government bought 17 soapboxes to put
around the park, that's government property, but the
government can't prohibit what kind of speech goes on
there.  Why isn't this a new public forum in a -- in a
new era?
MR. KELLER:  I don't think it's a public
forum for private speech for -- for various reasons.
The Court has never recognized a public forum for
private speech when the government places its name on
the message, when it completely controls the message in
the forum, when it is receiving notice and comment from
the public --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, but that's circular.
The whole question is whether you -- whether you can
control the message.  You're assuming the answer to the
question.
MR. KELLER:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I think
the Court has looked at governmental intent to determine
whether there's a public forum for private speech.  And
for all of the reasons that we're pointing out that this
is government speech, it is the same -- it is the flip
side of why a public forum hasn't been created.
So --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not quite sure
why it's government speech since it's -- there's no
clear, identifiable policy -- at least it's arguable
there's none -- that the State is articulating.  I mean,
they're only doing this to get the money.
MR. KELLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, a singular
programmatic message I don't think can be part of any
administrable test for government because government
must speak in all sorts of ways.  The Court in Summum
indicated that the 52 structures in New York Central
Park were all government speech, and yet, those -- it's
a wide array of messages, such as Alice in Wonderland.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it's --
here, I mean, you -- you could have conflicting
messages.  I mean, what is the government policy between
allowing University of Texas plates and University of
Oklahoma plates?
MR. KELLER:  The State of Texas can
absolutely promote the educational diversity of its
citizenry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, okay.  What's
its policy between permitting "Mighty fine burger"
place -- plates and, you know, "Pretty good burgers"
plates?
(Laughter.)
MR. KELLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, as a -- an
Austin, Texas establishment, the State of Texas, if it
wanted to, could promote that message.  But even if
Mighty Fine Burgers weren't a Texas establishment, Texas
is allowed to endorse speech.  And just because it would
be generating revenue --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's endorsing
speech?
MR. KELLER:  It is the government's speech.
The analogy would be an endorsement of such as a
professional athlete.  If a  professional athlete, for
instance, places a logo or a product or otherwise on
some apparel that the athlete is wearing.  That's still
the speech of the athlete.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But the
athlete doesn't advertise, you know, Nike on his jersey
and Adidas on his shoes.  You can see one message.  That
athlete is endorsing this brand.  But Texas will put its
name on anything and the idea that this is their speech,
again, the only thing that unifies it is they have --
they get money from it.
MR. KELLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, I don't
think Texas --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I bet he would if he could.
MR. KELLER:  The State of Texas does not put
its name on everything.  It -- it follows a formal
process with a public vote --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it does.  You
told me yourself.  You began, you said its name is
etched on the license plate.
MR. KELLER:  Sir, every message that is
actually appearing on a license plate, yes, that is the
State's message.  But that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And how many of them are
there?  How  --
MR. KELLER:  At -- as of the beginning of
this month, there were 438 specialty plates, 269 of
which were available for general public use.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  How many have you
disapproved other than this one?
MR. KELLER:  We addressed that argument in our
reply brief at pages 9 to 11.  Texas has -- sorry.
Texas agencies have denied about a dozen plates.  Some
of that information is in the record, some of it is not.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And in -- in -- which --
what other ones have you disapproved?
MR. KELLER:  The board's predecessor denied
a pro life plate.  The board itself denied a Texas DPS
Trooper's Foundation plate, and the board's predecessor
also denied about a dozen other plates.
Also, the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  All on the ground of
offense?
MR. KELLER:  The -- the information is not
clear as to what the grounds for those denials were.
The legislature itself has also repealed
multiple specialty plates that it also had created.
So -- so this shows that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And could -- could I ask,
Mr. Keller, if you go down to Texas and you just stare
at license plates, are most of them just the standard
license plate and then these 400 license plates you see
very rarely , or do most people actually have one of
these specialty plates?
MR. KELLER:  Well  there is a -- a wide
range, I believe most plates are still the standard
plate and --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But there's a very --
there's a substantial percentage that are not?  There --
it's not by any means unusual to see a specialty plate?
MR. KELLER:  It would not be unusual to see
a specialty plate in the State of Texas.  But the State
of Texas, by etching its name on it, can keep in control
of what appears on license plates.  It's still the
State's message.  Also --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the limits of this
argument?  That's what concerns me.  And your answer to
my billboard question was disturbing, but suppose people
still did go to parks, and the State had an official
State soapbox at the park, and every once in a while a
State official would mount the soapbox and, say, give
some official State announcement.  But other times
people who pay the fee would be allowed to go up there
and say something that they wanted, provided that it was
approved in advance by the State.  Would that be
official State speech?
MR. KELLER:  Justice Alito, I think there
we're starting to cross over into a situation what this
called -- what this Court in Summum called of a
subterfuge, that if you are abridging traditional free
speech rights, if you're limiting access to a
traditional public forum, then that would be an instance
where government speech is crowding out speech and
therefore it raised constitutional --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what does --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why hasn't this become
traditional?  I don't mean to interrupt Justice Alito,
but we're on, I think, on the same point.  Why hasn't
this become traditional now that you have allowed it?
You have opened up a new forum.
MR. KELLER:  Justice Kennedy, I don't think
it has become traditional because Texas has always
maintained control over its plates, and it has always
exercised editorial control.  So unlike a park which has
been held since time immemorial for the benefit of the
public to speak, license plates are a regulatory --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do -- do you want us
to say that public -- the public fora cannot evolve over
time according to -- and people don't go to parks
anymore.  They drive.
MR. KELLER:  Justice Kennedy, absolutely.
The -- the public -- traditional public forum can evolve
over time.  But the indicia of a traditional public
forum still has to be one that is open, and -- and Texas
has not opened license plates.  If other States wanted
to --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But in a world in which you
have approved 400 license plates and they are pretty
common in the State of Texas and you have only
disapproved a very select few, you know, it does seem as
though you've basically given -- relinquished your
control over this and, you know, made it a people's
license plate for whatever private speech people want
to -- to say.
MR. KELLER:  Justice Kagan, I think it would
be odd to say that it -- it's private speech when the
board is taking a public vote and receiving notice and
comment, a very -- a governmental function of when the
government wants to act, and then it is placing its name
on the license plate.  When the government is placing
its name on the license plate, it is accepting and --
and signifying that this is the government's message,
and you never --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does -- does it have
notice and comment for -- for every one of the 430-odd
that it's approved?  Every time there is a request, does
it -- is there a notice and comment procedure?
MR. KELLER:  If it's a legislature-created
plate, the legislature, of course, would do it and then
there wouldn't be an agency notice and comment
proceeding.  But under the existing law, notice and
comment would be required for every specialty plate
approved by the agency, which is all specialty plates
that are not approved by the legislature.
I -- I think a good analog to this case
would the U.S. Postal Services' postage stamp program.
There, the U.S. is placing its name directly on the
medium.  Thousands of stamps have been issued in the
past, and yet there is also private input that is
allowed on to what those postage stamps are going to
look like.  And just as it -- respondents can speak in
all sorts of ways on a bumper sticker right next to a
license plate or on a -- in the envelope on which a
stamp would appear, that doesn't mean that someone is
allowed responsive speech to whatever appears on a stamp
or whatever appears on a license plate.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does Texas also have
specialty plates insofar as the -- the letters or
numbers of the plates are concerned?  I mean, can you
get a license plate that says "Hot Stuff" or something
like that?
MR. KELLER:  Justice Scalia, we do have
personalized plates in Texas.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And are those censored?  I
mean, can you -- can you use a dirty word on those?
MR. KELLER:  The -- the speech there is
controlled completely by the State of Texas.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would think so.
MR. KELLER:  Texas, and this is not in the
record, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even though the individual
selects "Hot Stuff" or whatever other message he wants
to put.  So I guess if this is not allowed, we can't
allow that either.
MR. KELLER:  Yes, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right?  I mean, dirty words
are -- people are entitled to use dirty words.
MR. KELLER:  That's right.  Justice Scalia,
I -- the Court's holding in this case, I believe, would
directly affect the personalized plates.  And when --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I -- I'm not
sure your analogy to the postal service really works
because none of us can imagine the postal service having
commercial advertisements on its stamps.  One of the --
a license plate's here for RE/MAX Realty.  You are not
going to see that on a postal stamp.
MR. KELLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, it may be
true that the U.S. Postal Service has not chosen to
engage in that type of expression, but I don't think
that defeats the fact that this is still government
speech.  For all of the indicia the Court have
recognized in Summum and Johanns, and even Justice
Souter's dissent in Johanns, that wanted -- it was
looking for government disclosure, we have that here.
We have Texas's name etched onto the license plate.
Also untenable consequences could fall from
a -- an -- an opinion recognizing that Texas has to
offer responsive speech.  Texas should not have to allow
speech about Al-Qaeda or the Nazi party simply because
it offers a license plate propagating the message "Fight
Terrorism".
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but there is
an easy answer to that, which is they don't have to get
in the business of selling space on their license plates
to begin with.  If you don't want to have the Al-Qaeda
license plate, don't get into the business of allowing
people to buy their -- you know, the space to put on
whatever they want to say.
MR. KELLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, I believe,
though, that would be an answer to all of the government
speech cases.  And I -- in Summum for instance, the --
the Court didn't say, Well, if you don't want to accept
the Summum monument, just don't allow monuments.  And
that is because government is allowed to select the
messages that it wants to propagate and it's allowed to
speak in medium that it chooses.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that might be
because they've done that since, I don't know, the time
of the pyramids or whatever.  But they haven't had
license plate messages since time immemorial, so maybe
that is why they shouldn't be considered just like the
monuments.
MR. KELLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, I don't mean
to suggest that they are just like the monuments, but
there is still a fixed medium; an intangible message is
being displayed to a captive audience, as the Court
recognized in Lehman.  It -- and in those situations,
the government is entitled to select the messages that
it wishes to propagate and that are going to be closely
identified --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Personally, I would rather
have the license plates than the pyramids.  I -- I don't
know that we want to drive Texas to having pyramids.
MR. KELLER:  Justice Scalia, we also want to
retain our license plates.  And that shows, I think,
what this case is about.  The Respondents want Texas to
place its stamp of approval on the Confederate battle
flag through license plates, and Texas doesn't have to
make that judgment.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I don't want to beat a
dead horse, but I -- if -- what -- what is the best
distinction you can give me between what you do with
license plates and billboards, a soapbox, an official
State website where people can put up a -- a message
that they want subject to State approval?  If we were to
write an opinion that drew -- tried to draw a
distinction between the license plates on one side and
those other things on the other side, what would we say?
MR. KELLER:  Sure, Justice Alito.  I think
the very first thing is Texas has its name on it.  I'm
not sure in the billboard example --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Texas has its name on all
the other things, too.
MR. KELLER:  In this situation, we have
exercised selectivity and control as my previous answer
to Justice Kagan suggested.  Our reply brief at pages 9
to 11 addresses that.  Also, we market this program to
the public saying specifically that no one is entitled
to whatever design they want; rather, the board of the
legislature has to approve it.  That's at the final item
of the Joint Appendix.  So this is not a situation where
out in the world if you were to see a soapbox in a park,
that you would wonder is this the government speaking?
Is this not the government speaking?  Is the government
abridging traditional free speech rights?  This is a
case where Texas wants to maintain and has maintained
control of what it says on license plates.  And
Respondents -- everyone remains free to speak in all
sorts of ways.  Speeches, leafletting, TV,
advertisements.  They're on billboards.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I really don't think
that you've answered Justice Alito's question.  In every
park you need, generally, a permit to do certain kinds
of speech.  So the government controls that permit
process, and it tells you that it can say no.
So why is that different in the situations
that -- it can't be merely control is what I'm saying.
MR. KELLER:  Justice --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The ability to veto
because that would then give you the ability to veto.
You could create a program in every public forum that
basically controls in the same way.
MR. KELLER:  Justice Sotomayor, I think
there -- there's a difference -- we need to be clear
about what approval means.  If approval means access to
a forum and it's not government controlling every single
word of the message, then I don't think you have
government speech.  If it's simply -- you have a permit
to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Have we held that you
can -- you can deny access to a park or to a forum on
the basis of the content of the speech?
MR. KELLER:  Justice Scalia, content-based
regulations of speech --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Absolutely wrong.  And
you're denying access on the basis of content; right?
It's a different -- different situation entirely.
MR. KELLER:  Justice Scalia, that is
correct.  We are -- we are denying access.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Mr. Keller, one of
the -- one of the concerns that that raises, and this
really goes back to what Justice Kennedy said, is that
outside the traditional area of streets and parks, this
is a new world.  There are all kinds of new expressive
forums being created every day and as those come into
play, as long as the State says, hey, look, we're going
to regulate everything for offense, we're going to keep
anything offensive out of this expressive forum.  It
does create the possibility that in this new world with
all these new kinds of expressive fora, the State will
have a much greater control over its citizens' speech
than we've typically been comfortable with.
MR. KELLER:  That's right, Justice Kagan.
And I think for all of those reasons, a narrow ruling in
this case would possibly be a beneficial way to go, but
that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do -- do you know of any
other expressive fora that are owned by the State that,
are manufactured by the State that have the State's name
on it as license plates do?  I mean, if there are a lot
of fora like that, boy, I -- I wouldn't really worry.
But I don't know of any others.  Do you know of any
others?
MR. KELLER:  No, Justice Scalia.  This
is -- this is a unique --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What can you tell me, then,
to help me which might not help others?  But I don't
think these categories are absolute.  I think they help,
but they're not absolute.  So I would ask the question
first, this isn't government speech in common English.
It is the speech of the person who wants to put the
message on the plate.  The plate's owned by the State.
The State says we don't want certain messages to be
displayed.  And my question is why?  Why not?  What is
the interest that the State is furthering in keeping
certain messages off the plate?
MR. KELLER:  Justice Breyer, the State's
interest is selecting the messages that it  wants to
put its name on --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm sorry.  If the
State -- then you have the Republican example,
-- the Democrats.  I mean, not every interest is a
justifiable interest.  Some are not, and some are.
That's why I asked my question.
They keep some off, and they let some on.
What is their interest?  Why -- which are the ones?  I'm
asking a factual question.  Why have they kept off the
ones they kept off while letting on the ones they left
on?
MR. KELLER:  Justice Breyer if you --
JUSTICE BREYER:  If they have no interest at
all in making such a distinction, then I think since
speech is hurt at least a little, they ought to lose.
But if they have a justifiable interest, since you can
put the bumper sticker next door, I think they win.  And
therefore, I'd like to know what their interest is.
MR. KELLER:  And the State of Texas interest
here is propagating messages that show the diverse
backgrounds, educational backgrounds, products of Texas.
JUSTICE SCALIA :  Well, yes -- I --
JUSTICE BREYER :  No.  I'm asking the
interest of --
JUSTICE SCALIA :  I assume that Texas likes
each one of these interests that they allow to be put
on the -- on -- on the license plate.  They like Texas
hamburger joints, and they probably would not approve
a -- a Chicago hamburger joint being on the Texas
license plate.  They -- they -- they like some of these
messages; others they don't particularly like.  Isn't
that right?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS :  Justice --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yea I'd like to get my answer.
I was asking you what is the interest in Texas, and why
does it keep off the messages it keeps off?
MR. KELLER:  In this particular example --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  Not just this example.
There are a set of things they've kept off.  Why?
MR. KELLER:  Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, don't try a general
rule.  I think the Justice is asking you for a specific.
Why would you --
MR. KELLER:  Justice Breyer, I'll use the
example of the Texas DPS Troopers Foundation plate that
was also denied.  There, Texas didn't want that on its
license plate because it was concerned that if a
motorist were pulled over, that then the police officer
would see that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So go through this.
Look, I can think of many reasons I could make up.
Maybe they want to keep controversial political messages
off.  I'd say they have an interest in that in
suggesting to people Texas doesn't sponsor this -- I
just want to know what -- what they really are.  And now
you've said one -- what was the one you just said?
MR. KELLER:  The Texas DPS Troopers
Foundation plate, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm interested in
Justice Breyer's question.  You're on the license plate
approval board.  What standard do you follow?  When do
you grant a request, and when do you deny it?  What is
the rule?  I think that's what Justice Breyer is asking.
MR. KELLER:  Yes.  And Texas regulations
provide that the board can deny a license plate for
something that members of the public would find
offensive, but it also says that the board can deny
plates for any reason established by a rule, which is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  Then I think they
lose.  The reason I think they lose is because I don't
see a State could come in and say we keep off a private
message, and we'll tell you the reason later.
We'll -- we can do it for any reason we want.  There
you're hurting speech, and I don't see Texas's interest
in saying we can keep it off for any reason we want
because that would be the Republican-Democrat, too.
MR. KELLER:  Well, but Justice --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So what's
the -- I'm -- same question, but I just think you have
to have some kind of legitimate reason for keeping off
the -- and it doesn't have to be much.  It could be just
a little.
MR. KELLER:  Well, Texas can have legitimate
reasons for not allowing --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Then why don't you tell us
what they are?
MR. KELLER:  Well, I think, though, that
that would require something like a formal process
and -- that Summum --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it doesn't.  I just
want to know what they are.
MR. KELLER:  And Justice Breyer, Texas does
not have to associate itself with messages that it
doesn't want to and finds offensive.  And because Texas
has given that explanation here, we know that.  But many
times government officials speak and -- and they don't
disclose their motives, and that's perfectly --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But here, Texas -- Texas
did.  And now, we get full circle back to the -- my
first question.
Texas didn't just say no.  It said this
message would be offensive to many people.  So
that's -- if -- if a message would be offensive to many
people, that's a standard that they're applying.  And I
asked isn't that too broad a discretion?
MR. KELLER:  No, Justice Ginsburg.  The fact
that we have that much discretion confirms that this is
government speech.
Mr. Chief Justice, if I may  remain -- reserve
the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
Mr. George.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. GEORGE
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. GEORGE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
We're here representing the Sons of the
Confederate Veterans because they wanted to have a
license plate to raise money, in fact, for the State of
Texas to keep up monuments, which was the purpose of
their whole process in this case.  And the State of
Texas has gone about issuing an open invitation to
everybody to submit to them public designs for license
plates and to create -- and thus, it's created a limited
public forum for these license plates.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can Texas -- can Texas
itself formally, let's say, by a -- a joint resolution
of the legislature endorse the Grand Army of the
Republic and not the Sons of the Confederacy?  Can Texas
do that?
MR. GEORGE:  The legislature can endorse
anything it wants.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the State can; right?
So -- so can the -- can the legislature endorse Austin
hamburgers?
MR. GEORGE:  Well, the Legislature has
created a Confederate Heroes Day in --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And --
MR. GEORGE:  -- in this particular case.
And they -- people on my side -- this side of the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about Yankee heroes?
Are they --
MR. GEORGE:  They -- they -- they --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- are they honored in
Texas?
MR. GEORGE:  -- do -- well, they created a
holiday for --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  To --
MR. GEORGE:  -- people -- for Juneteenth
when the slaves were freed.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What I don't understand is
why this sticks in your craw when it's on -- on a
license plate --
MR. GEORGE:  The --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- when you acknowledge
that Texas can do all of these things so long as it's
Texas speech.  The only question here is whether this is
Texas's speech or not.  If it is Texas's speech, all of
these things can be said, can't they?  Can't all of the
things --
MR. GEORGE:  If it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that are on the license
plates --
MR. GEORGE:  If it's Texas speech by
itself --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It --
MR. GEORGE:  -- and is not joint speech
because of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. GEORGE:  -- the location.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  This doesn't seem to me
like a very significant issue --
MR. GEORGE:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- if that's all you are
concerned about.
MR. GEORGE:  Well, the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So long as Texas says
it's -- it's okay, but, boy, if you put it on a license
plate, that -- what -- I don't understand what the
theory is.
MR. GEORGE:  Well, the State has created a
very successful money-raising program in which it
solicits people to come in and submit their design for
their license plate so they can -- they have to submit
the design.  They have to put up the money to make
the -- put the -- a plate.  And then the plate doesn't
ever get published to anybody until the person --
somebody orders it from the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose -- suppose the
message -- the -- the applicant said, we want this
design, and the design is a swastika.  Is that speech
that -- does -- does the -- the -- whoever is in charge
of it -- of the license plate, do they have to accept --
MR. GEORGE:  I don't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- that -- that design?
MR. GEORGE:  I don't believe the State can
discriminate against the people who want to have that
design --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So they could have the
swastika.  And suppose somebody else says, I want to
have "Jihad" on my license plate.  That's okay, too?
MR. GEORGE:  Vegan?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Jihad.
MR. GEORGE:  Jihad.  Jihad on the license
plate?  Can be -- there is obviously a court of
appeal -- a district court from Ohio in which "Infidels"
was held to be -- the State --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is your answer --
MR. GEORGE:  -- wouldn't put that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is your answer in
this case as to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical?  Yes or
no, must the State put those symbols or messages on the
plates at the request of the citizen?  Yes or no?
MR. GEORGE:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about "Make pot
legal."
MR. GEORGE:  Say it again.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  "Make pot legal."
MR. GEORGE:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's okay?  And "Bong
hits for Jesus"?
(Laughter.)
MR. GEORGE:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you're -- you're really
arguing for the abolition of  Texas specialty plates,
aren't you?
MR. GEORGE:  I am arguing that if the
State --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I couldn't make a better
argument for -- in that direction than -- than what
you've been doing.
MR. GEORGE:  Well, we had got along without
it a long time before we got it, and we can get along --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so in a way --
MR. GEORGE:  -- without it again.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So in a way, your argument
curtails speech?
MR. GEORGE:  Only if --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you prevail, you are
going to prevent a lot of Texans from -- from conveying
a message -- you have to agree with that.
MR. GEORGE:  I would -- if -- if the -- if
the State continues to use the same standard, which is
it might offend anybody, the State can -- can deny the
plate.  If that's the standard, then the -- and -- and
they exercise their discretion on the statutory standard
that it might offend somebody --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you have no alternate
standard in order to have a proper -- or solution that
seems -- seems wise for Justice Ginsburg's hypotheticals.
You have no standard.
MR. GEORGE:  I -- the -- the answer to
having a standard that controls people's speech is that
the standard has to be pretty low-hanging fruit.
As -- in the Christian Law Students
Association, College of Hastings, v. Martinez, Justice
Alito, in the dissent for the dissenters in that case
said that offensive speech is something that -- speech
that we hate is something that we should be proud of
protecting.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, that's in that
context.  So you -- but I'm trying -- you say they can
or they cannot have a standard which says we're trying
to keep offensive speech off the license plate?
MR. GEORGE:  I -- as long as the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You say yes or no?
MR. GEORGE:  -- definition of offensive is
in the eyes of the beholder --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.
MR. GEORGE:  -- of course.
JUSTICE BREYER:  They can do that?
MR. GEORGE:  They can't have that.
JUSTICE BREYER:  They can or cannot?
MR. GEORGE:  Cannot.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So now I see what
you're saying.  But if I were to go back to sort of the
basic underlying thought here, is speech hurt?
JUSTICE BREYER: :  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  The answer is, yes, it is.
The private speech is somewhat hurt.  A lot?  Well, put
up a bumper sticker.  You can't say a lot.  How is it
hurt?  You don't get the official imprimatur.  Hmm,
okay.
Now, is there something to be said for
Texas?  Yes.  What they're trying to do is to prevent
their official imprimatur from being given to speech
that offends people.  People don't like it?  Put up a
bumper sticker.
All right.  Now we have two interests in
opposite directions in many, many cases.  We try to
weigh those things if the other things don't tell us the
answer.  And I would guess -- I don't really see the big
problem -- that people who are putting up speech even
that Texas considers offensive, in part, for reasons
that Justice Scalia says, well, put up a bumper sticker.
What's the problem?
MR. GEORGE:  Well, the -- I -- the culture
of creating specialty plates began in Texas in 1965.
We've been doing this, and we have gone bonkers with
people buying these things in the State.  There are
50,000 people with -- with the private plates --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's a lot of money
in this, isn't it?  It's about $8,000?
MR. GEORGE:  Say what?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is it about $8,000 to
get one of these plates?
MR. GEORGE:  I think it's a little more than
that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  More than that.
MR. GEORGE:  And that -- that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have -- I -- I have a
different question, which is -- I actually do think that
this is hybrid speech.  It's both government and the
individual speaking at the same time.  But that goes
back to what Justice Scalia said.  In Wooley we said we
can't compel the individual to put something on their
license plates that they disagree with.
MR. GEORGE:  That's -- we had that case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't the reverse
true for the government?  If you're going to ask me to
put my name, because the law requires it, the State's
name on a license plate, why can you compel us to do
something we don't want to endorse?
MR. GEORGE:  Well, the reason --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why shouldn't it work
both ways when it's --
MR. GEORGE:  The reason is that this has
become -- and it's the numbers -- it's become a limited
public forum for putting up messages.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But how -- how do I know
which is the government's and which is only the
individual's?  I mean, I -- I -- I wouldn't have known
that pro -- that -- that pro anything was sponsored by
some States and not others, or endorsed by some States
but not others.  So how do I know that a particular
license plate the government doesn't endorse?
MR. GEORGE:  You can't tell whether the
government wants your speech in advance in this program.
You have to submit what you think you want, and then
the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that implies a
certain degree of approval.
MR. GEORGE:  And these -- well, of course,
there is approval.  Just like there's approval for
someone to speak in a park, the -- in the Columbus, Ohio
case where the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's -- that's -- I
think was brought out earlier.  You can have time,
place, and manner regulations for speaking in the park.
You can't have content-based regulation.  This is --
this is a content basis, content the State doesn't want.
MR. GEORGE:  The -- and they have.  They
have a standard that is -- that -- the lowest common --
common denominator.  If any person could be offended,
they can deny it.  That is their standard, which, in
fact, is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it wasn't quite
that.  It says it would be offensive to many people.
MR. GEORGE:  No, ma'am.  I think the statute
is -- it says, actually, any person.  So --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, of course,
Mr. George.  If you had a standard like that in a case,
in a normal case where we were regulating private
speech, of course, we would find that impermissible.
But the question is whether this is a very different
kind of context.
And let's go back to -- I think Justice
Scalia said it, about the nature of license plates.  I
mean, I think there is a clear regulatory purpose here.
It's the government that actually makes the license
plate.  I think the license plate continues to be public
property, if that's right, like you have to return the
license plate.  It has the State's name on it.  It's
clearly the official identification that the State gives
with respect to a car.
So why doesn't all of that make -- make this
a very different case from the typical forum cases
that -- that we usually address?
MR. GEORGE:  Well, the reason is that we do
have hybrid speech and they opened up, and they created
this billboard, as Justice Alito said, they created a
billboard opportunity.  And they have -- since they can
make everybody have a license plate, they said we're
going to create a billboard opportunity and put
messages -- let you put messages on it and pay us money
for using our billboard.  That's what they've done.  And
then they say to some people, but if I don't like your
message because you're a Republican or you're a Democrat
or you are -- you want to say Mighty fine burgers
instead of Whopper Burger, they can do that.
That sort of arbitrary control of speech
based upon a standard that it might offend anybody is
they either need to get rid of the program, or they need
to open up the program just to everybody else.  And if
somebody publishes a speech they don't like, Justice
O'Connor in the Columbus, Ohio case suggested you just
make them put a number under it whom the Ku Klux Klan
puts a cross on the hill in Columbus, Ohio.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I asked my question before,
if you remember it, really, because I wanted an answer.
MR. GEORGE:  I'll try again.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It wasn't a statement.  It
was -- it was -- I'm trying to get rid of all the
conceptual basis here.  You just go back -- forget the
public forum, et cetera, forget all that.
MR. GEORGE:  Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Just go back to look to see
is speech being hurt, and the answer is of course yes,
but not much, because they can put a bumper sticker.
Then you look at the other side of it, and you say, does
the State have a legitimate interest here?  And the
State says yes, our interest is that there are messages
we like, messages we don't care about, and messages we
don't like.  And do we have a system for keeping the
last off because it is the government speaking, which
represents the citizens, and the citizens do -- its
their government, and they don't want, just as in the
examples Justice Scalia gave, to have their government
associated with messages that this commission doesn't
want.  And maybe there are limits on that, but that's
the basic idea.  Okay.  Now, weigh those two things.  I
think you'd say, little harm to speech, we see the other
broad, da, da, da, et cetera.  Now, what's your
response?
MR. GEORGE:  Well, the response is the forum
has been created.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Forum.  See, it's the
conceptual part, and I can't tell whether a forum -- a
license plate's a forum or not a forum, or if it's a
three-part test or -- I can't get that.
MR. GEORGE:  I understand.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm trying to go back to
the basics of it.
MR. GEORGE:  Well, one of the -- one of the
ideas that you have articulated, and others on this
Court, is that what would the reasonable observer
believe this was.  For example, the -- would they
believe that the speech is the State's speech or would
they believe it's the person who bought the plate,
because there's no -- nothing gets communicated --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about both?  How
about both in answer to that?  It is the State's license
plate.  It has Texas on it in big letters, so -- and
Texas says, yes, we have to approve it, yes, we approve
a lot, but there's some we don't approve, because it's
our speech, it may be the car owner's speech as well,
but it is our speech.
MR. GEORGE:  Both -- the State has dozens of
potential designs for plates that don't carry anybody
else's message, and they have 480 designs for
organizational messages and 50,000 personalized
messages.  And the issue in this case is the person who
puts the license plates on their car is the one that
communicates the message.  The other people are just
giving approval.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose the State had many
fewer plates from which to choose.  So let's say they
have the standard plate, and then they have a plate for
every college or university in the State.  That's your
choice.  Would that be government speech?
MR. GEORGE:  It certainly is government
speech in the sense that – and partly from government
speech, the ability to choose somebody -- the
government – the universities in the State.  And if the
standard by which they issue those is that we're going to
put one for all the colleges in the State, and that is
the standard, of course that's okay.  Because it is
a -- a standard that has -- they chose or the legislature
chose, I suspect, that says you can have -- everybody
who has a college can get into this program.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Suppose they
broaden it.  So it's not only the colleges and
universities, but it's all the places in Texas of
historic interest or natural features of the State.  How
about that?  Now you've got a lot more.
MR. GEORGE:  They actually do those and
those are not sponsored by anybody.  Those are
State-created for -- and they charge more money from us --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But answer -- answer the
hypothetical.  Justice Alito says first colleges and
next scenic places.  That's  okay or not?
MR. GEORGE:  Scenic places, they can -- they
actually --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then I'm sure he has
some other --
MR. GEORGE:  -- they can and do.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And suppose that there's
some little town that thinks that it's really scenic and
they -- there's a way in which they can petition to get
on this list.  Do you see where I'm going?  At some
point, if it's -- if you have just a standard State
plate, of course that's government speech.  If you've
got 5,000 different variations that people can create
for themselves, it becomes a lot harder to say that's
government speech.  So where would you draw the line?
MR. GEORGE:  My view is that when the people
get to create a message themselves, and then -- an
organization in this case -- create the message for
themselves, and then the people who look in the catalog,
pick out the license plate that they want and put it on
their car, then the speech is the speech of the person
who communicated it is predominantly --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My -- my problem with
this is, how do I know?  There are three categories of
plates, I understand.  There's the official State plate,
there are specialty plates created by the legislature,
and there are specialty plates created by an individual.
How do I tell the difference between the legislative
plates, which are government speech, and the private
plates?  Do I need to?
What I do know is what I said at the
beginning, it's both people speaking.  And I think both
people endorsing each other's message in some way.  So
why should the government be compelled to accept speech
it rejects because it thinks it's wrong?
MR. GEORGE:  In the first place --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And doesn't want to be
associated with directly.
MR. GEORGE:  I understand.  In the first
place, the way people pick out plates, there's a big
long catalog with 400 different organizational plates,
480 now, and it grows every day, of organizational
plates.  And people pick them out of -- on -- out of a
catalog out of a website, and they pick the one they
want to pick, and then they put it on their license
plate.  The communication of the information on the
license plates actually is controlled entirely by the
people who pick the plates.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what about Justice
Alito's hypothetical -- we never did quite finish --
where the direction of his question was, suppose the
State, all by itself, has 10 messages, 20 messages, 200
messages, 2000 messages, you can choose, but the State
makes up all the messages and gives you all the choices.
What results?
MR. GEORGE:  Well, the result is if the
State has -- controls all -- has all the messages and
picks all the messages, and then the people from whom --
whom it picks -- who it sells the plates to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I know that's the result
of the hypothetical.  I want to know the legal result.
What's the First Amendment answer?
MR. GEORGE:  Well, the State can design all
kinds of license plates that it wants to choose --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is the scheme that I
proposed, and that followed from Justice Alito's
questions, consistent with the First Amendment or not?
MR. GEORGE:  My -- it is not First -- when
the individual submits -- when people, other people
submit the design --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's not the
hypothetical.
MR. GEORGE:  I understand that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The hypothetical is the
State has 5,000 designs, and the State makes them all
up, and you can choose.  Is there a First Amendment
violation?
MR. GEORGE:  I don't believe -- if the State
does everything, then it's -- it's the creator of the
message and the speaker is the driver.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What happens if private
people could submit messages, but they all had to go
through the legislature?
MR. GEORGE:  My view is that it is a much
more difficult case for us if the legislature passes a
statute, because that is a legislative act and a clear
act of the State.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what's the difference,
then?  I mean, if you say -- if you think that that
would be all right, you know, Texas has said, well, the
DMV does it, not the legislature, a different branch of
government, but it's government just the same.
MR. GEORGE:  I understand that.  And the --
and the issue is whether or not the -- in the cases --
we have court of appeals cases that don't distinguish
between legislative action and non-legislative actions,
and those that do.
It is my judgment that the State has a
greater claim making its speech when every -- when the
legislature passes the bill and the governor signs it,
then the statute is clearly an explanation -- or
expression of the State.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if you --
MR. GEORGE:  What regard when anybody buys a
license plate --
JUSTICE BREYER:  When -- in Wooley, go back
to that for a second.  I take it that if I object to the
message on the New Hampshire plate, Live Free or Die, I
have a right to be disassociated with that.
MR. GEORGE:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Well, if the State,
which represents many people in Texas, doesn't want to
be associated with the particular message, why doesn't
it have the right to say we don't want that event, we
don't want that association.
MR. GEORGE:  Because --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, the State
represents X million people.  They don't want to be
associated with this message through their official
organ.
MR. GEORGE:  I understand.  Quite frankly --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the difference?
MR. GEORGE:  The difference is they invite
people to make their -- they charge people and have them
pay for the manufacture of the license plates by giving
them the chance to design a message.  That's what they
do.  They -- it costs the people who come up with these
things, they pay all the front-end costs, put up $8,000
collateral before any license plate is built, and it is
a money-making scheme that they use.  The fact that they
choose to, apparently twice in history -- and there may
be more, but I, we can't document anymore -- they've
ever turned anybody down, this is not a forum which
people actually -- they make any decision besides an
economic decision.  It's a factual matter; that's what
happens.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, can I ask
you, it's a somewhat technical question but you just
touched on it.  Do you have an objection to the
materials that your friend has cited from outside the
record?
MR. GEORGE:  I -- to the extent he's cited
issues relating to the other design, I do not have an
objection to that, because I think it's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You think that it --
it's the extrarecord materials are accurate --
MR. GEORGE:  I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- actually.
MR. GEORGE:  I think so.  They are almost
certainly accurate from what we found since we filed our
brief.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.
MR. GEORGE:  And I -- the fact that we have
gone from 350 to 480 organizational designs since the
case was tried, I -- was not in the record either, but I
don't doubt that he has sold a lot more organizational
plates since then and they keep a better tally than we
do.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what is your -- the
choice, the choice that Texas had, am I right, that in
your view if they're going to have this -- these vanity
plates, it has to be open to everybody, or they can shut
the program down and nobody gets vanity plates.  But
maybe if the legislature passes a law or laws saying
this plate is okay, that might be okay.
So what -- is the, is the choice between
everything or nothing, with the exception of what the
legislature does is okay?
MR. GEORGE:  I -- I believe that the best
analysis is the legislature or the Motor Vehicle
Commission discriminates against people's speech on the
basis of the content of the speech, that is subject to
serious First Amendment concerns and is probably
illegal, although there may be some exceptions to that.
That's what I think the better rule is.  But we have
conflicts in circuits about that and we have not -- this
Court has not addressed -- that is not this case, but I
believe it is a -- an issue --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. George, could I just
take you back to the Chief Justice's question for a
moment and just make sure I understand it.  Mr. Keller
has indicated that there are a number of other occasions
in which the State has disapproved plates, and in which
the State has done that on the grounds of offense.  Do
you -- do you have any objections to those
representations?
MR. GEORGE:  To the extent that they were
done on the grounds of offense, I do, because he has one
that I can -- that we have verified, and that one is
that there was a concern about a danger on -- to the
driver's thinking that somebody's state trooper plate
made them a state trooper.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the
argument --
MR. GEORGE:  That's what he said, at least.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  What if the
argument were not simply offensive but a higher degree?
You know, incitement or likely to give rise to -- I
mean, I think someone driving in Texas with a swastika
is, you know, is likely to be -- to trigger public
violence.  Is the level of the State's interest at all
pertinent to your position?
MR. GEORGE:  Well, the -- this Court's
rule -- law on incitement, going back to Brandenburg v.
Ohio and the Ku Klux Klan rally that this Court decided
was not incitement, is -- is pretty thin at this point
in our history, because I don't know what the rule of
incitement would be today.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but Mr. George, just the
worst of the worst, whether it's the swastika or whether
it's the most offensive racial epithet that you can
imagine, and if that were on a license plate where it
really is provoking violence of some kind.  You know,
somebody is going to ram into that car --
MR. GEORGE:  I just don't -- I don't think
people can -- the government can discriminate on
content.  They can put on the license plates that they
disagree with, "This is not the State's speech," in big
orange letters and disclaim that speech.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where is that going to
fit on the license plate?
MR. GEORGE:  Perfectly legitimate -- huh?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where is that going to
fit on the license plate?
(Laughter.)
MR. GEORGE:  They -- but those, that's --
you can put -- we have "Taxation Without Representation"
on the District of Columbia's license plate and that's a
political message.  They can put --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your position is that if
you prevail, a license plate can have a racial slur.
That's your position?
MR. GEORGE:  Yes.  I don't think there's any
consistent decision otherwise, although the State can
disclaim it, undoubtedly, on the same license plate.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have to put
"Taxation Without Representation" on your D.C. plate?
MR. GEORGE:  That's my understanding.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or can you ask for a clean
plate?
MR. GEORGE:  I haven't -- well, I'm not
living here, but I believe it is required.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If somebody objects I guess
it's like, "Live Free Or Die," right?
MR. GEORGE:  They can put it -- put it on --
tape it over.  But you can put, obviously the disclaimer
idea, Justice O'Connor came up with that in -- in her
concurrence in the Columbus, Ohio, Ku Klux Klan, cross
on the hill case, and I thought that was a pretty good
idea.  That is, that we have a disclaimer when you don't
like the speech, and you don't believe it's appropriate.
The State can do that.
And I think that's largely part of the
answers.  This is not -- certainly not purely
governmental speech because the action of the State is
only approval.
As to the Pleasant Grove, City of Utah case,
monuments are in fact unique circumstances.  This Court
had decided Perry -- Van Orden v. Perry some years ago
involving -- Justice Breyer put a map of the State
capital grounds with all the monuments in it, those
monuments -- and when that case was decided, been there
over 100 years and the monument in question had been
there 45 years.  Monuments are different than any kind
of speech in the park, because of the nature of the --
the creation.  You couldn't -- you'd have place in
commons with monuments every seven feet, which is you
can't do that.  And that case turns on those facts, and
I believe it is absolutely correctly decided.
I'm also convinced that the Johanns v. the
Livestock Marketing board is correctly decided, because
it started with the statute passed by Congress telling
the Department of Agriculture to do something, right
where -- marketing from material, have it submitted back
to the secretary of agriculture, let him approve it,
then go market it and levy a tax on imported beef to
support it.  That's all government speech.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you know how much money
Texas makes from this?
MR. GEORGE:  I don't have that -- it's not a
line item in the budget, but lots.
JUSTICE ALITO:  That is really all this is
about, isn't it?
MR. GEORGE:  Yes.
(Laughter.)
MR. GEORGE:  That's why Texas is in the
business.  And so people get to play and do business
with them that they like what they are saying, and they
don't get to do business with them when they don't like
what they said.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Keller, you have three minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You have very limited
rebuttal time and I do have one question.  You were
asked a question about the Republican -- the Democrat
distinction and you said, Oh, there might be some other
thing equal to it.  Is there a First Amendment standard
that you can use to deny that plate?
MR. KELLER:  I believe it would be
government speech and therefore there would not be a
First Amendment problem.  But I believe it would not be
allowed because other constitutional bars would apply.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No First Amendment.
MR. KELLER:  Just as if a monument were put
up in a public park on par with a candidates speech it
would be the government speaking, however, it would
not be allowed under other constitutional provisions.
Justice Alito and Justice Kagan, if I can --
if I can suggest a way to avoid the billboard problem.
When the government has its name on a speech and when
the -- it is part of a regulatory process or a program
of the government's and there's formal notice and
comment and there's a public vote and there's no
abridgement of traditional free speech rights, which is
this case, I think that's government speech.
Justice Breyer, to address some of the other
interests that Texas has here.  Texas wants to prevent
offensiveness and vulgar speech and wants to prevent
confusion and misrepresentation, promote safety, it
wants to celebrate the diverse interests that the State
has.
Justice Sotomayor, you're absolutely right
that even if this is hybrid speech and it does take two
to tango in this situation, you need both the motorist
and the State propagating the message that that is still
government speech.  All the -- all of this Court's cases
on government speech have been at posture.
For one clarificatory matter, all of our
cites in our reply brief and our opening brief to Title
43 of the Texas Administrative Code, those have been
renumbered since the filing of our reply brief, but the
substance is all the same.
And at base, this is not just about Texas
making money, although Texas does make money.  This is
about the State of Texas not wanting to place its stamp
of approval on certain messages.  And a speaker is not
entitled to the imprimatur of the State of Texas on
whatever message that it wishes to put on a license
plate.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
The case is submitted.
