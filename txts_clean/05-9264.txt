CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in James versus United States.
Mr. Crawford?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG L. CRAWFORD, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CRAWFORD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
We confront today the Eleventh Circuit's
troubling interpretation of the otherwise clause of the
Armed Career Criminal Act. Under the text and structure
of the act, as well as the categorical approach that this
Court recognized in Shepard and Taylor, Florida
attempted burglary convictions should not qualify as
they -- these types of convictions do not involve
explicitly, implicitly or even inherently, a serious
potential risk of physical injury to another.
The Respondent in their brief has enunciated
a test to determine whether a conviction should qualify,
and that test that they enunciate is basically a
district court judge or a sentencing judge uses their
common sense and experience to determine whether an
offense should qualify. That type of test is not the
kind of test that this Court enunciated in Taylor and
Shepard when it looked at the very elemental approach at
determining whether convictions should qualify.
The categorical approach that this Court
enunciated refers to predicate offenses in terms not of
prior conduct but of prior convictions and the elements
of those crimes.
As such, the Government's argument would
open up a -- is a broad mandate that courts could use to
bring in almost any type of crime, any kind of felony to
be included within the Armed Career Criminal Act. For
instance, simple possession of cocaine is a third-degree
felony in Florida. It's a five-year statutory maximum.
Under the serious drug offense that Congress enumerated,
it would only qualify if it had a 10-year statutory
maximum and it involved the distribution of drugs. Yet,
if the Government's approach to the interpretation of
the otherwise clause is to be used, that simple
possession of cocaine could qualify if a judge using
their common sense and everyday experience determines it
presents a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another. Obviously --
JUSTICE ALITO: If we were looking at
attempted generic burglary of a residence, wouldn't that
involve conduct that presents the serious potential risk
of physical injury to another?
MR. CRAWFORD: Your Honor, in Taylor, this
Court was clear that under enumerated burglary or
generic burglary, the offense becomes a -- has that
serious potential risk when the person actually enters
the dwelling or enters the structure; and under an
attempted burglary, at least in Florida and in most
other States, that act has not occurred. You haven't
entered, the defendant has not entered the property.
JUSTICE ALITO: If the would-be burglar is
climbing through the window or on a ladder with the
intent to climb through the window, wouldn't that
involve almost the same risk or maybe the same risk?
MR. CRAWFORD: If the conduct -- again,
we're looking at, then, a fact-based inquiry.
Obviously, some attempted burglaries could get that far.
Other attempted burglaries are caught well before that
actually occurs. But if you were to say that the
attempted burglary was climbing up a ladder trying to
get into the place and the person actually didn't get
in, again, under Taylor, it says the risk is when the
person enters. The risk is much less outside the
dwelling than inside the dwelling.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in Florida, that
would be burglary itself, right, because it covers the
curtilage around the house?
MR. CRAWFORD: The curtilage is a unique
concept, I guess in Florida, in that the curtilage is the
enclosed space around the house that has some kind of
enclosure, whether by fence or whether by bushes. So if
the place was enclosed and you had a ladder going up to
the residence, that would actually be a burglary within
the State of Florida. In other States, it may not.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And we don't
even have to ask whether that presents a serious
potential risk under the statute, right? Because, if
burglary is identified as -- a predicate offense without
the need to resort to the definition?
MR. CRAWFORD: Well, it would be a burglary
in the State of Florida, but under the test enunciated
in Taylor, it wouldn't qualify because Taylor was very
specific. It is the entering a dwelling or structure.
And in Florida, you could be guilty of a burglary
without entering a structure or dwelling, just like in a
curtilage burglary.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you could do it in a
noncurtilage burglary State simply by putting the
ladder up to the window and getting on the first rung of
the ladder. I mean, you would have -- you would have taken
a substantial step. You would have made an attempt. Now
why would that not qualify under the words of the
statute that referred to a potential risk? Haven't you
created the potential for the risk of harm that the
statute is getting at when you take the substantial
step?
MR. CRAWFORD: Well, trying to use the
Court's words in Taylor, Taylor talked about that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how about my question
first?
MR. CRAWFORD: Okay.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, haven't you in the
words of the statute, created the potential for the risk
when you take that substantial step by starting up the
ladder?
MR. CRAWFORD: If you started up the ladder
and that's the way the attempted burglary conviction
came down, it would be a lot closer call to say that
would be a potential risk. Whether it's a serious
potential risk under Taylor, it is not as clear.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you wouldn't analyze it
on the basis of whether this defendant started up the
ladder. As I understand, you would -- you have to
analyze it on the basis of whether generically attempted
burglary as a whole presents a serious enough risk;
isn't that the way it has to be done?
MR. CRAWFORD: That's the way that we submit
it has to be done, and you wouldn't be getting to those
facts.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I thought your
argument was that that analysis would not lead to the
result unfavorable to your client because the nature of
starting up the ladder did not create or could not
reasonably be seen as creating this kind of risk.
In other words, I thought you were saying --
maybe I misunderstood your argument -- that the reason
the Taylor analysis favors you is that merely taking a
substantial step -- which is what the indictment would
charge -- could not be seen as creating the potential
risk that the statute talks about.
Now if I'm not understanding your argument
correctly, you know, straighten me out here.
MR. CRAWFORD: I think I understand. That
substantial step in even taking a step up the ladder,
Mr. James would submit based on the language of the
statute, would not qualify and would not create that
serious potential risk of physical injury.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And that's why simply
charging attempted burglary will never satisfy the
statute under a Taylor analysis as you understand it.
MR. CRAWFORD: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But even if it would,
that's only one manner of attempt. And it seems to me,
if you're going to do it generically, you have to look
over the whole scope of possible attempts and say does
the whole scope of possible attempts bear, I would say,
a similar risk of the use of physical force as do the
specifically mentioned crimes of burglary, arson or
extortion? Indeed, I guess you have to use the least
dangerous. Wouldn't you say extortion is probably, of
those mentioned crimes, burglary, arson, extortion, or
the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct.
Now that "otherwise", that refers me back to the crimes
already mentioned, and I would say that means that the
unnamed crime has to have a similar risk, at least a
risk as high as the least dangerous of the crimes
mentioned, which I would take to be extortion.
Wouldn't you say?
MR. CRAWFORD: Of those four, extortion does
seem to potentially have the least risk of all those
crimes enumerated. But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And what's a potential
risk, by the way?
MR. CRAWFORD: A potential risk --
JUSTICE SCALIA: A potential potential? I
mean, every risk is potential, isn't it?
MR. CRAWFORD: In the Government's -- in the
Respondent's brief, they talked about how risk and
potential and serious, some of those worlds potentially
knock each other out, and I apologize for using that
very word, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think potential risk is
just risk really?
MR. CRAWFORD: I think it is a risk.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't one way of
looking at it -- I mean, I, when I read it, you know, I
thought it's just redundant. But it may very well be
that the word potential is in there in order to
accommodate attempts.
MR. CRAWFORD: If that were true, I mean,
Congress when they wrote the statute, and in
4(e)(2)(B)(ii), or (e)(2)(B)(ii)(1), they specifically
enumerated attempted crimes to qualify under that
violence. So it has an element, use of or attempted use
of, or threatened use of physical force. But under
prong two, they specifically deleted that word
"attempt".
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Specifically deleted
or didn't --
MR. CRAWFORD: They did not include it, and
under --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's quite
different than specifically deleting it. In other
words, it was never there in the proposal.
MR. CRAWFORD: In 1984 actually, there was a
proposal where burglary would qualify and attempted
burglary would qualify. That was passed by the Senate,
never passed by the House, never enacted.
So later on when burglary was actually
defined, burglary was defined as the type of burglary
that Taylor came close to defining the same way.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, do I understand
your submission to be that putting a ladder against the
side of a house to attempt burglary, starting up the
ladder, that that generically does not pose a potential
risk of physical injury?
MR. CRAWFORD: If that were the only way to
prove an attempted burglary within a State, if that
would be -- that would be the requirement, the legal
requirement that you have to put the ladder against the
house and that's an element of the offense, that to me
would be a much closer call; but still, under the
analysis that we have provided the Court with the
Russello presumption, it should not qualify. But it is
a closer case.
Whereas categorically when you look at
attempted burglaries, the putting the ladder against the
side of the house is an element of the offense.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We understand from
your friend on the other side that an overt act toward
fulfilling the attempt is required under Florida law.
In other words, it's not just enough to have burglary
tools in your house.
MR. CRAWFORD: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've got to take
an affirmative step toward accomplishing the burglary.
MR. CRAWFORD: It is an overt act that is
beyond mere thinking about it.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why doesn't anybody -- you
know, count. It sounds to me if you're wondering about
whether there's a specific serious risk of harm, you could
find out. Look at the conviction that in Florida for
attempted burglary, look at the convictions for burglary,
and see if the harm involved, the number of cases in which
people are harmed is roughly similar. We have all these
law professors who like statistics. Now they like law in
economics and everything. So why don't they go out
there and count, and then we'd actually know, instead of
sitting here and trying to figure out something I know
nothing about. I've never been involved in a lot of
burglaries. I don't know how the burglaries operate. I
suspect some people are hurt, but rather than my
suspicion why don't we find out what the facts are?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: We're not going to be
able to do that in time to decide this case.
JUSTICE BREYER: But wouldn't it be, as a
method of approaching --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It would also keep the
professors from other mischief.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what do we know about
the dimensions of the Florida attempt crime? For
example, you have said it doesn't mean that you possess
burglary tools. Does it mean or does it exclude casing
the house, walking up and down the street, around the
block?
When is a step substantial enough to
constitute an attempt under Florida law?
MR. CRAWFORD: Well, it's not really a step
analysis, a substantial step analysis. It is an overt
act. It's some overt act manifesting your intent to
actually --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is that concretely?
It's not possessing burglar's tools, it's not casing the
place. What qualifies as an overt act that would make
one guilty of the crime of attempted burglary?
MR. CRAWFORD: If you had a diagram of the
person's house and you had burglary tools in your car
and you had maybe even called to make sure the business
was closed and you were driving there and as you're
driving there you're telling the person sitting beside
you: I'm going to break into that, you know, business
at 254 Main Street. That would be enough under Florida
law to convict someone for attempted burglary of a
structure.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we have to decide
how many attempts involve that kind of initial action,
which doesn't seem very physical threatening, and how
many of them involve putting a ladder up against the
side of the house.
How do we possibly figure that out, to
decide whether as a whole the degree of risk from
attempted burglary is as high as at least the degree of
risk from extortion?
MR. CRAWFORD: That may be -- that may be a
very difficult question to answer, and maybe the
Respondent had that obligation in the district court,
because they have the obligation to prove that this
enhancement has that substantial or that serious
potential risk of physical injury to another and of
course they didn't do that. But if you look back in
this Court's decision in 1985 in Tennessee versus
Garner, this Court was talking about completed
burglaries and it talked about physical violence to a
person would only occur in a rare case, and it gave the
percentage I think of 3.6 or 3.8 percent of the time.
But that's in a completed burglary. That's
not even talking about an attempted burglary, what's the
risk --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this
question: It seems to me there are two ways to read the
burglary, arson or extortion examples: That they are
clear examples of crimes that would involve harm to
individuals, physical injury to another; or they are put
in the statute to say, even though they don't involve
serious risk, these specific crimes will be covered,
because your statistic of 3 percent suggests that
burglary itself probably would not qualify as a crime
that presents a serious risk of physical injury, but the
statute nevertheless defines it.
So do you read those terms as giving
examples of crimes that would not involve that risk of
injury or as examples of crimes that would?
MR. CRAWFORD: I think it can be read either
way, although I think even the Government's brief in
-- or the Respondent's brief in Taylor talks about
extortion and burglary being crimes that can be
committed with no risk of physical injury to another
person and yet Congress still specifically
enumerated those --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Crawford, if you had
that meaning in mind, you would not have used the word
"otherwise". You would have simply said is burglary,
arson or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or
involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk.
The other purpose of the "otherwise," which means in
some other manner, some other manner -- other from what?
Other from the preceding ones.
I don't think there is any sensible way to
read it except, you know, in some other manner than
these previously named crimes involves a physical risk;
and that is what causes me to say, well, what's the
least dangerous of the previously mentioned crimes, and
any crime you want to get into this residual category
has to be at least as dangerous as that. As I've said,
I think that's extortion.
MR. CRAWFORD: Using that analysis, it's
hard to figure out, but again the Government had this
obligation or we submit the Government had this
obligation, and they've not shown an attempted burglary
to be any more dangerous.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that,
is conspiracy to commit burglary a crime that poses a
serious potential risk as burglary does?
MR. CRAWFORD: In Florida, or in the
Eleventh Circuit, they have determined that conspiracy
to commit enumerated offenses do present that serious
potential risk.
JUSTICE BREYER: Sorry, go ahead.
MR. CRAWFORD: So in the Eleventh Circuit
they have determined that. But again, we submit under
that Russello presumption or even the statute itself,
Congress enumerated those four property crimes,
primarily property crimes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't that seem
like a fine line? I mean, if you're sitting around with
your coconspirator planning it you can be covered under
this provision, planning a burglary. But if you
actually get out there with the burglary tools, you put
the ladder against the door and you start up the ladder,
that somehow involves less of a potential risk of
physical injury?
MR. CRAWFORD: They both present very little
potential risk. They don't even really -- under a
serious potential risk, they don't present that. A
conspiracy shouldn't either. A conspiracy and attempt
are not different things because a conspiracy doesn't
qualify --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think the
Eleventh Circuit is wrong?
MR. CRAWFORD: I believe the Eleventh
Circuit is wrong with conspiracy as well.
JUSTICE BREYER: If we don't know and if I
can't get too far with the language and I frankly could
sit in my office looking at the computer screen I think
for hours and I wouldn't be closer to knowing whether
there is or is not a lot of injury that accompanies
attempted burglary, but that is something that is
possible to know. All we have to do, as I said before,
is count and there are a lot of people who can do that.
In fact, there are people who at least have a mandate to
do it and that is the sentencing commission. So they
have the tools. They have the ability. And so in the
absence on a question like this of my being able to get
anywhere by cogitating about the language and in a
borderline case where it isn't obvious, why don't we as
a Court simply follow a reasonable interpretation of
what the sentencing commission did in the absence of
better information from some other place?
MR. CRAWFORD: Well, the sentencing
commission when they were interpreting the career
offender statute, or guidelines, they were looking at a
guideline that is worded different than the --
JUSTICE BREYER: They're trying to find out
the same answer to the same kind of question: How many
of these attempted burglaries, how many burglaries, how
many other crimes are accompanied by an individual being
hurt? And as I say, I cannot imagine how to answer that
question in a borderline case without trying to find the
numbers, which I don't have here, and therefore since I
don't have them, why don't I look to the best, second
best alternative, which is at least they could get them,
and I hope they did get them before coming to the
conclusion they did.
MR. CRAWFORD: Well, they came to that
conclusion dealing with whether a career offender
provision should include attempted burglary not under
the armed career criminal statute and they specifically
recognized that.
Moreover, when they dealt with whether they
wanted to include attempted burglary, they were dealing
with career offender, which has, although it increases
the guideline range a person can be sentenced to, it
certainly doesn't increase the statutory maximum in zero
to 10 year offense to a 15 years to life offense.
So for those reasons, even if the sentencing
commission feels that the career offender statute or
guideline should include attempted burglary, that
doesn't mean this Court should use that for the armed
career criminal statute.
Moreover, the career offender statute says
it's only a burglary of a dwelling, although the armed
career criminal statute says a burglary qualifies if
it's a dwelling or a structure.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Crawford, we've held
that the named crimes have to be considered generically
according to their elements, right? Burglary, arson.
Have we ever held that the residual category or
"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious
potential risk of physical injury," that that has to be
decided generically? I mean, if we could apply that
residual category, not generically but according to the
crime that was actually tried and of which the defendant
has been convicted, such as laying a ladder up against
the house, that particular sort of burglary, it seems to
me it would be a much easier, much easier case, wouldn't
it? We'd be able to tell whether there was a serious
risk of physical injury.
Is there any obstacle to doing that?
MR. CRAWFORD: Well, Taylor and Shepard both
talk about that predicate offenses under 924(e) should
be looked at in a -- using a categorical approach, and
the Court has talked about that being an approach looking
to the elements of the offense.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Was it referring to the
residual category?
MR. CRAWFORD: It didn't specifically refer
to the residual category. But even in Shepard --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe it's not too late to
save ourselves from sending out legions of law
professors to do studies.
MR. CRAWFORD: If the Court were to step
back and say that the "otherwise" clause should be
interpreted in a noncategorical manner and we're going
to -- the Court decides it's a factual-based approach,
in Mr. James' case there are no facts, so it may not
make any difference for him because there's no facts to
indicate what kind of burglary really occurred here.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean no facts in the
indictment or charging documents?
MR. CRAWFORD: Correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there is in the
presentence report?
MR. CRAWFORD: That is correct. There were
facts that were presented in the presentence report that
came from police reports.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have any
doubt that, at least with respect to two of the other
named crimes, attempts would present a serious potential
risk? In other words, attempted arson or attempted use
of explosives? You concede those would be covered,
don't you?
MR. CRAWFORD: Actually, no. Those crimes,
attempted crimes, also should not come in unless there's
something about an attempted arson statute that has as
an element or something that presents a serious
potential risk of physical injury to another, which at
least in Florida that's not the case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think attempted
use of explosives is at least as dangerous as extortion?
I mean as far as the risk of physical injury is
concerned, I would think attempted use of explosives is
much more dangerous to physical health than extortion.
MR. CRAWFORD: Getting back to your
question, maybe this answers part of it: Although the
Court -- you asked, Justice Scalia, you asked a question
about why can't we make this basically maybe a
fact-based inquiry. And if you were to do so, the whole
categorical approach that we're dealing with in all the
other sections would almost become irrelevant because if
something doesn't apply categorically, then we'll go to
a fact-based inquiry and that kind of defeats the whole
purpose of the categorical approach.
JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Crawford, does the
record show that the facts in the PSR came from police
reports rather than from a plea colloquy or someplace in the
court records?
MR. CRAWFORD: The plea colloquy was not
ever presented or produced, and it does show that they
came from police reports.
JUSTICE ALITO: Where is that in the record?
MR. CRAWFORD: I believe that is stated in
the PSR regarding the facts that they alleged under the
attempted burglary, which again were objected to.
Specifically, the facts weren't necessarily objected to,
but the use of the attempted burglary was objected to,
and both the district court and the Eleventh Circuit
took that as being an objection to using anything
regarding the attempted burglary.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Crawford, may I ask you a
question about the relationship between generic burglary
and what Florida takes as sufficient to show an attempt?
And what I'm getting at is the issue that at least was
alluded to in the Jones case.
Do you understand Florida law on attempted
burglary to be as follows: that there must be an overt
act taken toward entering either a dwelling or a
structure, as distinct from an overt act taken to get
within the curtilage?
MR. CRAWFORD: The evidence -- I see my time
is up. Little me briefly answer this question. Or -- I
want to remain, or let some remain for my rebuttal.
Very quickly, the overt act has to refer to the
attempting to enter the dwelling. And so --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So there's no such thing as
attempted entry of the curtilage as an attempt offense
under burglary under Florida law.
MR. CRAWFORD: Under Florida law attempting
to enter the curtilage is an attempted burglary; it is
the same thing. Dwelling is defined as the building or
the curtilage.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so when you say
dwelling you mean dwelling as defined to include
curtilage.
MR. CRAWFORD: Correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. CRAWFORD: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Crawford.
Mr. Marcus?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MARCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court.
Petitioner's conviction for attempted
burglary of a dwelling under Florida law is a violent
felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act because like
the crime of burglary Petitioner's crime categorically
involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk
of physical injury to another.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Marcus, do you agree
with your brother's answer to my last question that
there would be an attempt -- could be an attempt under
Florida law simply to take an overt -- to commit an
overt act toward entering the curtilage as distinct from
entering a physical dwelling or a physical structure?
MR. MARCUS: Yes, while I would disagree
with that, but while there are -- with your
characterization. But there are no -- the number of
reported cases involving an attempted burglary that
involved an attempt to get on to the curtilage, if -- I
think -- based on --
JUSTICE SOUTER: We don't know basically
what Florida law is? I mean, is that the best answer?
MR. MARCUS: Yes. I don't, I don't think
you could conclude, they have -- there is no decision
telling you whether that would suffice. But we're not
taking the position that it could not involve an
attempted entry into the curtilage.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So that literally, I take
it then if someone did have a fence around the house,
and I, I -- I walked from the sidewalk onto the lawn
toward the fence, with the intent of getting over the
fence, that would qualify then, as you understand it, as
an attempted burglary under Florida law?
MR. MARCUS: Yes -- it could. It could --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Would that be true if I
simply wanted to get into the -- if my intent was to get
on the other side of the fence but not into the
dwelling? For example, you know, I wanted to steal the
apples on the tree?
MR. MARCUS: Well, I think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Would that qualify as
attempted burglary?
MR. MARCUS: I think it could. I think --
but I think you --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that give you a
pretty tough row to hoe, in saying that there is a
sufficient potential risk of the sort of harm that
qualifies under the act?
MR. MARCUS: I don't think so, Your Honor.
I mean Florida, in the State versus Hamilton case, we
discussed in our brief, Florida has defined curtilage
narrowly, strictly construed the word curtilage
narrowly, to limit that concept to an enclosed area that
immediately surrounds the dwelling. And the case
discusses a couple of cases from various Florida courts
of appeals where the courts construed the concept of
curtilage and held that in one case it was marijuana
that was quite a distance away from the, from a dwelling
house, in another case a whiskey still that was a
distance about 50 yards away from the dwelling house,
that those were too far out to be considered part of the
curtilage, part of that area that immediately surrounds
the dwelling that's associated with the intimate
activities of the dwelling. So Florida -- and Florida
-- and I think the Court should take the Florida Supreme
Court at its word when it said it's going to strictly
construe that concept, and when it said it's not going
to construe it to produce absurd, harsh or unreasonable
results, keeping in mind how serious the offense of
burglary is.
So I think the -- so the first step, I
think, if you don't -- if you don't believe that the way
Florida defines burglary is generic in the way Congress
had in mind, I don't think you could conclude that it
presents a categorically different set of risks such that it
would even fall outside the otherwise clause.
JUSTICE ALITO: There are a number of
Florida cases that involve open carports. How would you
apply it there? Somebody, if you had a carport that's
not fenced off at all, just 20 feet let's say from the
street, somebody walks into the carport and steals a
garden rake?
MR. MARCUS: Well, I think under the
current, I think under the current statute, it has been
amended since, since 1993 and '94, and -- which is
relevant, the statute is relevant to this case. I think
now carports are considered part of the dwelling itself,
the structure itself but under -- but if it -- but under
the Florida's concept of curtilage if the area was not
enclosed, it was not enclosed by a fence or other
structure it would not be considered part of the
curtilage. And in fact, the State versus Hamilton case,
it cited a case that cast a doubt on a prior case that
had found a burglary that took place on a driveway, and
noted that the court in that case hadn't determined
whether the area, whether the driveway was enclosed.
So it does -- the statute does -- the
concept does require an enclosure and the area
immediately surrounding the dwelling and I think it is
very difficult to conclude that that, that defined in
that way, in that limited way, that someone who's
intending to get on to a residence into the area either
in or right around the dwelling, that that person is not
sort of categorically dangerous kind of person that
Congress had in mind when it set out burglary as one of
the paradigmatic offenses in the statute.
JUSTICE BREYER: So in an ordinary city street
in Miami walking along the street, there are a lot of
houses, and there's a little bit of lawn or bushes in
front, and there's not a fence, because there isn't, or
there aren't fences in many city blocks, a person goes
up to the house and starts to monkey around with the
window to raise it or whatever, that's attempted
burglary, not burglary, in Florida?
MR. MARCUS: That -- yes. That is my
understanding. If it was not enclosed.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So then I doubt
-- then again I'm left at sea. I don't know how often
that happens or is dangerous. So if I think that this
is really a statistical question, and I think maybe it
is -- and the Government is in the best position, they
have all the statistics, they have whole bureaus over
there. So what about a presumption against the Government?
In a case where it seems to be a close case and it is a
statistical question, and the Government doesn't have
any statistics?
MR. MARCUS: Well, I think -- I don't think
when Congress enacted this law that it expected the
courts would have statistics available to --
JUSTICE BREYER: How are you supposed to
decide it if there's a question as there is this instance
I think?  I just don't know how dangerous attempted
burglaries are. I mean, maybe I'm not supposed to admit
there are a lot of things I don't know but there are.
And this is one of them.
MR. MARCUS: Well, there are several things
you can do. First you can look at the text of the
statute.
JUSTICE BREYER: I read the text several
times.
MR. MARCUS: Congress provided some guidance
by setting out four examples of crimes that do present
the type of risk they had in mind.
JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. And here I think
it might be less than burglary. And extortion, though
one thinks of somebody writing a poison pen letter or
something and revealing a secret from the past -- many
such crimes are threats of violence. I mean, and that
just read through the statutes, and that's what they are
aiming at. So I would say extortion is something that
quite often could involve violence.
But again that's cogitating. So I get
to attempted burglary. I don't know. Now what do I do?
MR. MARCUS: Well, I think -- I think you
have to consider what Congress's purpose -- in enacting
the statute, Congress directed your attention to the
serious potential risk that an offense presents. I
think that just -- and criminal law requires courts and
juries all the time to take into account and to use
their common sense and experience to judge the risks
that are presented by a particular crime. I mean, the
very concept of recklessness itself refers to a
substantial disregard of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Marcus, it is a lot
easier to do that with respect to the facts and
circumstances of a particular crime than it is to do it
generically -- you know -- picking out attempted
burglary. It is very hard to do that. Why shouldn't we
read this, this residual category to refer to the facts
and circumstances of the particular crime of which the
defendant has been convicted? The language enables you
to do that. The term violent felony means any crime
punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year
that involves conduct that presents a serious potential
risk of injury, physical injury to another.
Why can't we not, not interpret that to mean
generic crime, but rather the particular crime of which
this defendant stands convicted?
MR. MARCUS: Well, all that -- this law has
been interpreted for many years. No courts of appeals
have, have construed that it way. They have construed
it to require a categorical approach. And then if you
look at the structure of the provision, Congress clearly
with respect to the listed offenses had in mind a sort
of a categorical approach that, while these courts had,
sort of looking at one of these crimes on an ex post
basis, it might not present any risk, the idea that
these crimes categorically present a potential -- a
serious potential risk of physical injury.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And would you agree,
Mr. Marcus, that this Court's decision in Shepard
excludes that interpretation? If you look at the
particular crime?
MR. MARCUS: Well, I think the Court
referred both in Taylor and Shepard to the -- to
Congress's approach. And under the statute, that sort
of that it wants you to take a categorical approach to
crimes that are inherently presented --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Didn't we -- didn't we also
go further and say one reason to construe it that way is
we don't want courts to have to be, in effect, having
sort of subsidiary collateral trials after the fact, to
establish -- you know -- the facts of old trials. There
was an administrability analysis involved. I think
there was. Yeah, I wrote Shepard. And I think that's
what --
MR. MARCUS: There was that as well. And I
don't think it is beyond the ability of courts to
take a crime, look at the elements of the crime, figure
out what conduct is necessary to satisfy those elements
and then use common sense and experience to make a
judgment about how that -- the risks that are posed by
that conduct. Looking at the situation --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Marcus, isn't there
this -- this linguistic problem with the statute anyway?
Because this language if it said -- that sometimes
presents a serious risk, then the answer would be
obvious. If otherwise it said that characteristically
presents a serious risk, then it might be closer. And
which do you think is the more normal reading of it?
I think either is -- certainly fits the
language.
MR. MARCUS: And either --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Either means sometimes
presents a potential risk of physical injury, then
obviously they're all covered. Or if it says
characteristically presents the risk, potential risk,
then do you have to decide whether that, it is a
characteristic of potential burglary that it -- that it
does present this risk or that just once in a while it
does.
MR. MARCUS: No. I think it's not -- no I
think it has to, characteristically taken at a general
level, the conduct required to commit a burglary, of
getting --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If that were true, and if
as your opponent said, that in actual burglaries there's
only three percent of them actually involve risk to --
of physical injury to another, then attempted burglary
must necessarily be somewhat less than three percent. I
would think that. Would that satisfy the characteristic
requirement?
MR. MARCUS: I think it would. First of
all, Congress --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is it two or three
percent?
MR. MARCUS: The statistics he is referring
to came out before Congress amended the statute in 1986
and expanded it and specifically enumerated burglary as
one of the crimes that it thought paradigmatically
presented a serious potential risk of injury.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I don't think that's
perfectly clear. The "otherwise" language does suggest
that you are right. But if the statute instead of
saying "otherwise" had said, "or involves other conduct
that presents a serious risk," which I think is a
permissible reading, perhaps not the best reading, but
if it said that, then it is not -- you are not taking as
a given the fact that the others satisfy the violent
requirement but rather that they are eligible, whether
or not they do.
MR. MARCUS: Well, this Court interpreted
the statute that way in Taylor -- I mean, I'm sorry, on
page -- on page 597 of Taylor. I mean this Court said
that Congress's choice of language indicates that
Congress thought ordinary burglaries as well as
burglaries involving some aspect making them especially
dangerous, presented a sufficiently serious potential
risk to count toward enhancement. I mean, that's right
in the Taylor decision, and I think that has got to be
the correct reading of the statute. Because why did
Congress identify -- they created two categories of
violent felonies. The first is with respect to an
element of the offense that goes to targeting a person
for physical harm. The second category are those crimes
that don't necessarily target a person for physical harm
but necessarily present, inherently present a risk of
physical injury to a person.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be fine if
burglary were the only thing that Congress said there,
but it also said extortion. And I think it absolutely
fanciful to believe that extortion characteristically --
characteristically -- involves a risk of physical harm.
I just don't think it does.
MR. MARCUS: Well, Congress identified it as
a violent felony presumably because it believed it had
-- it had the criteria.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but is the criterion
"characteristically," or is the criterion whatever
minimal risk of harm there is in extortion?
MR. MARCUS: Well, that it carries the
potential risk, because when any -- when someone
commits extortion there might be a tendency to -- if
there --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the level of potential
risk the level that exists in extortion? Right? That's
what the otherwise refers you to.
MR. MARCUS: Yes. To the level of risk
that's presented by any of the preceding examples.
That's correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe, the same point,
isn't it reasonable to assume that the risk of harm in
these attempt cases is characteristically going to be
pretty close to zero? I mean, they're not in the house.
They're just on the ladder, in the kind of examples
we've been talking about.
MR. MARCUS: I don't agree, Your Honor. The
statute directs you to consider the serious potential
risk.
JUSTICE SOUTER: One way to do that is to
say the potential risk is the potential for the risk of
the harm that comes from the commission of the crime
itself.
I mean, there is -- I don't want to overdo
it, but the risk of harm to others from the -- from the
step on the ladder is zero, if you consider simply the
act itself of putting the ladder up against the building
and taking the step. It's only because that creates the
potential for getting inside where the risk, in fact, is
measurable. I mean, we know there are cases in which
victims get shot when they appear in the course of
burglaries, but the risk associated with the mere
attempt in isolation is going to be minuscule.
MR. MARCUS: When you're assessing the risk
presented by particular conduct, I think you have to
take into account the intent that goes along with that
conduct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I agree with you. But
the act that involved -- the act that constitutes the --
that qualifies for the attempt doesn't involve it. I'm
trying to help you here. I mean --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't believe it for
a minute.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you look at
the risk of burglary and then view attempt as a sort of
lesser included offense? I mean, attempts themselves
have their own independent risk of physical injury.
Obviously, if you've got a ladder up against the side of
my house and you're halfway up and I come home, there's
a risk of injury there, even though there's no --
regardless of whether the person gets into the house or
not.
And I think perhaps there's even a greater
risk of potential -- greater potential risk of injury
with respect to attempts because they don't succeed.
Why don't they succeed? Because something interrupts
them. And what interrupts them, it may well be the home
owner. So I don't know that you have to look to sort of
attempt as a lesser risk than the burglary itself.
MR. MARCUS: Well, Congress doesn't look to
attempt as a lesser offense. We pointed out in our
brief that the vast majority of provisions in the U.S.
Criminal Code punish the attempt the same as for the
completed offense. And if you think about the purpose
of the ACCA, and the ACCA is not focused on the results
of the prior crimes of the armed felon committed, it is
focused on the risk, the propensity that somebody has,
has demonstrated by engaging in at least three prior
violent felonies or serious drug offenses to engage
in behavior that is dangerous, that presents
dangers to public safety. So if you think about the
attempt and the whole concept of attempt, I mean, someone
who has committed attempt by definition has intended to
commit the offense and as you said, Mr. Chief Justice,
has only failed by reason of an unforeseen event.
Why would Congress in this statute want to differentiate
between the frustrated burglar whose only -- who hasn't
succeeded only by virtue of an unforeseen event, and the
successful burglar? I think the serious potential risk
language allows you to sort of look at the attempt as
you said, Mr. Chief Justice, as virtually the
equivalent --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would suppose the
unsuccessful burglar poses a greater risk of physical
injury than the successful burglar.
MR. MARCUS: Arguably. I mean, if you look
at the case law, the vast majority of cases, the
furthest out, the furthest case the Petitioner can find,
the most extreme case that he's found involves someone
who's in the backyard of a dwelling reconnoitering or
casing the dwelling, and that was the most extreme
example. So even with attempts, you find in all the
case law, you do find the physical proximity to the
premises.
And one of the main reasons it wouldn't
succeed is because somebody, there's the presence of
someone who frustrates the entry. So that even on that
level, at that level, it is hard to say that there's any
lower risk presented by the attempt.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what do you say about
your brother's argument that the statistics show there's
a 3 percent chance, I think it was a 3 percent chance of
violence in the course of committing the burglary? I
take it there isn't any statistic available, if we want
to take Justice Breyer's approach, about the
potential -- the actual proven potential for violence at
the near attempt stage.
MR. MARCUS: But again, I think -- I don't
think you need to have those statistics.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I don't think you do
either, but I mean, I think your whole argument has got
to rest really on the potential for harm in the
commission of the offense.
MR. MARCUS: That's the very reason that
attempts are prohibited, because they present the
serious potential to produce the harms that the
completed offense presents.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do I correctly understand,
we don't need the statistics, I guess they're not
available, but in your view if we did have statistics
and they showed that in 1/10 of 1 percent of the
category of crimes across the nation, there was this
risk, that would be enough?
MR. MARCUS: For attempts?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. Well, for attempts
or complete -- I mean, just say the standard of what
presents a serious potential risk of physical injury, if
/10 of 1 percent of the crimes -- whatever the
category, did present such a risk, that would be
sufficient under your view.
MR. MARCUS: Yes, I think Congress wanted to
treat a frustrated burglar the same --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The answer is yes?
MR. MARCUS: Yes. They've shown the same
propensity to engage in the conduct that Congress was
concerned about that falls at the heart of the statute.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So then it's a really easy
case, because really there is some risk in every case.
There's some risk that somebody will, you know, bump
into somebody or give them a punch in the nose at least.
MR. MARCUS: But that's not what we're
asking the Court here. We're asking the Court to look
at the elements of the offense, and to look at the
elements of the offense to see whether that creates a
situation in which violence is likely to arise. Here
you're talking about, this is attempted burglary of a
dwelling where you have --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but none of the
elements of the offense satisfy the risk of physical
injury in the burglary case. You can have unarmed
burglars.
MR. MARCUS: But in considering the conduct
involved in the offense, the attempting to get, the
attempt to enter a dwelling, enter someone's home,
someone's residence, that creates a dynamic situation in
which violence could occur --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. And as I
understand your view --
MR. MARCUS: That doesn't --
JUSTICE STEVENS: If in 1/10 of 1 percent of
the cases, there is in fact a physical confrontation,
that's enough, which makes it a pretty easy case.
MR. MARCUS: Yes. But again, first of all,
I don't think the statistics would show that.  I don't
think logically they would show that in light of the
numbers that are shown for completed burglary. But
again, I don't see -- with respect to the offenses that
are covered that are at the core of the statute, I don't
see why you would distinguish between the person who
tried to get in but was frustrated by some unforeseen
event. They have created the same set of risks, they've
triggered the same set of risks that the successful
burglar has.
JUSTICE ALITO: So in other words, you're
saying that in measuring the risk, you should consider
not just what this particular defendant succeeded in
accomplishing, but what the defendant was attempting to
accomplish?
MR. MARCUS: That's correct. I think the
statute permits you to do that with its plain language
of focusing on the potential risk of the conduct, the
serious potential risk. And that -- and also in looking
at the rationale for attempts and why we punish
attempts, in terms of the person is, you get punished
--
for attempts because you sufficiently manifested your
dangerousness in the same way as someone who's completed
the offense. Again, the State codes, the vast majority
of State codes demonstrate the riskiness of attempt
behavior. They predicate felony murder convictions on
attempted burglary as well as burglary. And as I said
JUSTICE BREYER: What about attempted
assault? I bet nobody has ever been hurt in an
attempted assault.
MR. MARCUS: Well, I think, my understanding
would be that would be covered under the first subsection
for the use -- attempted use or threat, threatened use of
force.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But it wouldn't
fit within your -- I mean, I just wonder what happens
when you try to get away from numbers. Maybe there are
a certain number of people injured during mail fraud or
embezzlement, you know, some people get annoyed during
an embezzlement and start hitting each other.
I can't get away from the numbers.
MR. MARCUS: But there in those type
offenses, if you look at the elements of the offense,
there's no nexus between those elements and the -- a
reaction that someone might have just to being
prosecuted. I mean, that's not --
JUSTICE BREYER: So what's the test? The
test is either a high statistical number of injuries or
if not, a nexus to a crime that does have a high
statistical number of injuries? I like the word nexus
because whenever I see it in an opinion, I have no idea
what it means.
(Laughter.)
MR. MARCUS: Well, in this statute you're
talking about career criminals, people who have
committed a number of crimes and have recently just been
convicted of being an armed felon. And I think
that's -- when you look at -- that can be your starting
point, and take -- so this case doesn't present
questions about other cases that might present --
arguably present, or present a serious risk of physical
injury, but don't necessarily seem to fit with the
crimes that are listed and what the crimes that Congress
had in mind. I think that's another case. This case
falls at the core of the statute; we're talking about
someone who intends to commit the core crime Congress
was talking about.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Marcus, assuming we
accept your view about the way the statute should be
read, I take it you agree that because of the curtilage
possibility under Florida law, that Florida law, that
burglary in Florida is not a generic burglary?
MR. MARCUS: We haven't argued that it is
generic burglary. That's correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I guess my -- so that leads
me to this question, because -- I mean, I, my
understanding is it's not a generic burglary.
Therefore, even on your reading of the
statute, an attempted burglary in Florida doesn't
necessarily satisfy the prong, and it's got to come in
under the residuary clause, of course. And because
there is a possibility that the only burglary charged
was a burglary of the curtilage, we've got to -- don't
we have to send the thing back to find out either from
court records whether something more than a mere
penetration of curtilage was involved here? And if so,
whether -- whether that penetration carried with it the
potential for harm?
MR. MARCUS: I mean, no. That's why you
have the otherwise clause, to cover offenses just as
this Court said in Taylor, that they weren't --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the only thing we
know under the otherwise clause, is that this was an
attempt at burglary. If the burglary were a generic
burglary, your analysis, if we accept it, would be the
end of the case.
MR. MARCUS: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But this is not a generic
burglary. Therefore, we have to assume that the attempt
in this case could have been nothing more than stepping
across the grass, moving toward the fence, to lean over
to take the apple. And therefore, don't we have to go
to court records? In other words, don't we have to take
advantage of the qualification in Shepard and Taylor
before this case can finally be decided?
MR. MARCUS: No. I mean, you've identified
an additional step that the Court has to consider in
deciding the question in this case, but that step doesn't
necessarily require you to go to court records. I mean,
it's our position that even including the curtilage, the
area, enclosed area immediately surrounding the dwelling
presents a serious potential risk of physical injury
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, could you tell us
what your position is if we choose to use the
noncategorical or the modified categorical approach?
Is there a nexus between what's in the presentence
report and some other charging documents, or is it just
in the presentencing report?
MR. MARCUS: Yes. The charging documents
are not part of the record in this case. The record
right now is solely comprised of the presentence report.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And we don't have any
transcript of colloquies with the court or anything like
that?
MR. MARCUS: No.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what about -- do you
think the facts in the presentence report are admitted
by your opponent or not?
MR. MARCUS: He didn't object to the facts
in the presentence report. He also did not object --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Therefore, can we consider
them?
MR. MARCUS: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So therefore, then the
question is whether throwing the hammer through the
window is sufficient; is that right?
MR. MARCUS: Well, that would resolve
Justice Souter's question about whether it would involve
the curtilage at all, which would show that there was an
attempted physical entry into the residence.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you think that the
hammer through the window is a decisive fact if we do
look at the individual case?
MR. MARCUS: Well, we don't -- yes,
certainly we think that any attempted burglary of a
dwelling presents a serious potential risk
categorically. But if you didn't agree with that, then,
and you thought that only a subset of attempted
burglaries of dwellings would present serious potential
risk, then clearly this offense here that would certainly
satisfy any conception of that.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Because the hammer is
thrown through the window, is that -- I just want to be
sure I understand your view of the importance of the
hammer.
MR. MARCUS: Because there was an attempted
physical entry into the residence. The person was right
on the threshold of the dwelling.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm still a little unclear
as to how much significance we pay to that hammer.
MR. MARCUS: Again, we don't think you have
to attribute any particular significance to that. I
mean, it's our position that categorically this crime is
covered. And again, the case law shows that there's --
that with attempted burglary cases, there is a physical
proximity to the dwelling, but even if there was --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though there's some
cases in this large category that clearly wouldn't
involve any risk to anybody. Say the enterprising but
careful burglar who keeps watch for several days to see
when no one is in the house, that that's when he chooses
to make his entry.
MR. MARCUS: That's correct. You can always
posit, under the categorical risk, you could always
posit a specific nonthreatening hypothetical that
equally applies to burglary as it does to attempted
burglary. And so while you could posit a hypothetical
where someone trying to get onto the curtilage might
seem like it wouldn't present any injuries, if you think
categorically about people who are trying to surmount,
get over fences and walls to commit offenses in the
dwelling or immediately around the dwelling, they're
presenting the same sort of risk, and therefore the
Court can conclude that it also -- within the otherwise
clause, the burglary under Florida law is not so
different from the kind of burglary that Congress had in
mind that it would just drop out of the picture
entirely. Armed felons who have the propensity to go
into the curtilage of someone's home, to either go in
the house or right around the house, present the very
kind of risk that Congress was concerned about.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that this
presentence report cannot be consulted under the
reasoning of Shepard, we need more?
MR. MARCUS: Well, under Shepard, the
defendant in Shepard had objected to the use of police
reports. My understanding is he also submitted an
affidavit saying he didn't acknowledge the truth of
anything in the police report. So I think this case is
distinguishable in that there was no objection to the
facts in the PSR and there was no objection
specifically to using the police report as the source
for those facts.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't think the PSR
has some kind of significance that the police report did
not?
MR. MARCUS: It wouldn't, no. I don't think
it would. But -- no.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is the following sort of
summary fair: Because Florida is not a generic burglary
State, the mere conviction of burglary would not satisfy
the burglary prong in subsection 2? But on your
argument, even though Florida is not a generic burglary
State, an attempted burglary will always satisfy the
"otherwise" prong; is that correct?
MR. MARCUS: Argument --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that a fair statement of
your argument?
MR. MARCUS: Yes. If the completed offense
is a violent felony, the attempt to commit that offense
is also a violent felony. That's a fair statement of
our position.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Marcus.
MR. MARCUS: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Crawford, you
have four minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG L. CRAWFORD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CRAWFORD: It seems to me that
Respondent's position is taking the "otherwise" clause
to trump the entire rest of the statute. Any crime, any
felony, has a potential of violence. In fact, in
footnote 9 of the reply brief we cited the Golden opinion
from the Seventh Circuit and in that particular opinion
the court found that serious potential risk for someone
who failed to report to a jail because they speculate,
you know, law enforcement might have to go and arrest
them and there could be violence in that situation.
Well, that happens in all crimes, the potential for law
enforcement to arrest somebody. There's always a
potential for violence.
So the Government's position --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's different when
you're dealing with an escapee or someone who has
visitation right and then doesn't report back and
qualifies as a escaped felon from prison. That's quite
a bit different from an arrest in a normal situation.
MR. CRAWFORD: But there's still the same
potential for violence in either one of those.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. There's a
greater -- I had this case in the D.C. Circuit. There's
a greater degree of potential when you're dealing with
someone who's escaped from prison than with someone
else who's being arrested. Of course there's always the
potential, but the judgment was that there's a greater
degree of potential when you're trying to apprehend
someone who's escaped.
MR. CRAWFORD: For someone who's escaped.
Golden wasn't dealing with that. Golden was dealing
with someone who failed to report to a facility after
being sentenced to do so. The same could be said for
someone failing to report to a court for a hearing. A
bench warrant is issued. The same type of risk would be
inherent in that type of -- for that person as for
someone who fails to report to a jail upon being
sentenced.
All of those potential crimes, basically
that would leave open any potential felony to qualify
under the "otherwise" prong. Congress obviously
couldn't have intended that.
Moreover, there's still an issue that was
brought up in Shepard on the constitutional avoidance.
How do we actually make these determinations and are
these necessarily determinations that were found by the
Florida court or by the Florida system for a Florida
attempted burglary conviction? We submit it's not.
And you're going beyond the mere fact of the
prior conviction. You're looking at many other
components, the risk of the conviction, which is not the
same thing as the mere fact of the prior conviction.
If there are no further questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Crawford.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the
