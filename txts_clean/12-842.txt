CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 12-842, the Republic of
Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd.
Mr. Blackman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN I. BLACKMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BLACKMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The sweeping worldwide forensic examination
of foreign state property that the court of appeals
approved targets sovereign property that the FSIA makes
categorically immune from process of U.S. courts,
including diplomatic, military property, national
security assets, property of the States, current and
former presidents, and other property outside the United
States.  This far exceeds the enforcement powers of U.S.
courts under the FSIA.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Aren't those issues of
privilege?  And didn't the Court below permit you to
raise those questions as individual items came up?  As
individual accounts?  Because the subpoena is only
asking Bank of America for -- or the banks for their
information.  Some of them may be of that nature.  But
wasn't the district court going to monitor that?
MR. BLACKMAN:  Well, two answers to your
question.  First, Justice Sotomayor, the FSIA comes
logically and legally before issues of privilege as to a
specific asset.  There's a categorical limitation of
execution and all process in aid of execution to
property in the United States used for a commercial
activity.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's on what you can
execute.  FSIA itself doesn't say anything about
discovery.  Is that right?
MR. BLACKMAN:  The FSIA doesn't have a
provision except for 1605(g), which specifically talks
about discovery.  But the statute very much delineates
the bounds of permissible discovery when it delineates
the universe of executable property.  The legislature --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  In an ordinary State case,
let's say, you get a judgment in -- in New York, and the
judgment is -- is not satisfied.  And so there is this
kind of an inquiry into what property the -- the losing
defendant owns.  Cannot you find out what property that
defendant owns in Florida?
MR. BLACKMAN:  In Florida, certainly, yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the New York court
has -- its writ does not run to Florida.
MR. BLACKMAN:  The way Rule --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have to bring
another -- another lawsuit in Florida, right?  And so
also here, the writ -- the writ of the Second Circuit
doesn't run to -- to France.  You may have to bring a
separate suit in France.  But -- but I don't -- I don't
see that it goes beyond the bounds of what the -- of
what the law allows the discovery to -- to cover.
MR. BLACKMAN:  Well, Rule 69, which has
never been construed in the area of discovery in aid of
execution by this Court, provides for discovery in aid
of execution.  And in aid of execution logically needs
to mean the execution that could be ordered by the court
ordering the discovery.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's absolutely not
true because a New York court cannot order execution on
property in Florida.  You have to bring another --
another cause of action in Florida.  And yet, you
certainly can find out what -- what property the
deadbeat defendant owns in Florida.
MR. BLACKMAN:  Rule 69 also says
specifically, Justice Scalia, that it is subject to a
Federal statute that governs where applicable.  And the
advisory committee notes -- clearly lists the whole host
of exemption statutes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're saying that you
can't inquire into property that would be exempt
anywhere.  That's the difference.  You may have to bring
a separate suit in Florida or probably if it's a Federal
judgment you just register it there.  But in the typical
case, the judgment debtor is exposed, all of her assets
are exposed.  Here I think what you're saying is the
statute, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, confines
what can be executed.  Whether Florida, France,
anyplace, it's got to be property -- commercial property
in the United States.  Is that --
MR. BLACKMAN:  That's -- that's exactly
correct, Justice Ginsburg.  And I was referring to the
exemptions that are listed in the Advisory Committee
notes because they list things like homestead and
veterans benefits and other categories of assets.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what's the reason --
I mean, I read this like Justice Scalia.  I thought when
you read Rule 69, obtaining discovery, you can obtain it
in aid of the judgment or execution as provided in the
these rules.  So you look to the rule on discovery.
It's certainly broad enough to encompass this.  I
thought, of course, you can get discovery, in an
appropriate case, to find out if the judgment creditor
or debtor has property in Florida.  And the question is:
Well, can you do the same thing where the executable
property is in France?
MR. BLACKMAN:  I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And then I think that's the
issue, at least as I saw it.  And I don't see -- well,
there are two -- three ways of doing it.  One, you could
just say no.  Two, you could say yes, but the State
Department has to tell you it won't mix everybody up.
Or you could say yes, but the State Department has the
right to come in and tell you it will mix everybody up.
I mean, those are three possibilities, or you could say
let's mix them all up.  Are those -- those are the four.
In other words, the Court can just do it on its own.
So -- so I see four possibilities.  Now, maybe I'm not
analyzing it correctly, but that's where I was, starting
where Justice Scalia started.
MR. BLACKMAN:  If I could respond to some of
those points, Justice Breyer.  Talking about the State
Department brings us back to why do we have this
statute.  We have this statute to avoid ad hoc judicial
or political interventions.  Before the statute, there
was absolute immunity for foreign state property.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I know.  But just to sort
of shorten this, I understand there's a statute.  The
statute says nothing about discovery.  The statute does
permit you to execute on property within the United
States anyway.  And it does that under exceptions which
are relevant here.  For example, on the back of a bond
they said, we waive all sovereign immunity.  So -- so it
does allow for execution in the United States.  It does,
in fact, say nothing about discovery in aid of
execution.  The rules do.
Okay.  So I've given you four possibilities
that I could see.  There may be five or six.  Which do
you favor?  Why?
MR. BLACKMAN:  I favor saying that "in aid
of execution" means in aid of execution permitted by the
substantive law.  There's no statute that we've thought
of or could find where discovery is untethered from the
substantive provisions of the statute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that goes back to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you -- do you contend
that you cannot levy upon commercial property in foreign
countries where those countries have the same kind of
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act as we do?  When you get
a judgment in New York, can you take that judgment and
levy upon commercial property of Argentina in France?
MR. BLACKMAN:  To the extent and only to the
extent that the judgment would be recognized by a French
court.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course.
MR. BLACKMAN:  A U.S. court could not levy
on them.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you are entitled to find
out what -- what property Argentina has in France.  And
your only complaint is you shouldn't be able to find out
what -- what non -- what -- what property that is not
subject to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is in
France, right?
MR. BLACKMAN:  Well, property that's subject
to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is only property
in the United States used for commercial activity.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no.  But you
acknowledge that -- that you can levy on property in
France.  You can take your New York judgment, go to
France and so long as the property is commercial
property and France has the same, which it does, the
same modern rule that sovereign immunity does not extend
to commercial property, you can -- you can satisfy your
judgment in France.
MR. BLACKMAN:  But that's a matter of, with
respect, the French law and what the French court would
permit, including discovery.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course.  But that
doesn't mean you can't find out and go to France and
roll the dice in France, right?
MR. BLACKMAN:  Well, we would suggest --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're -- you're saying you
can't even play the game.
MR. BLACKMAN:  No.  We're saying that the
way you play the game is to do what the Respondent here
has done for many years, which is to pursue discovery of
property in the United States that's executable by the
process of a U.S. court.  But if it wants to go
abroad --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I can't understand this.
You acknowledge that you can go after property in
France, but you assert you are not entitled to find out
what property Argentina has in France.
MR. BLACKMAN:  That's a function of a
statute which deliberately circumscribes the normal
powers of a court.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Suppose I
don't -- I have exactly the same question.  Is the only
reason that you cannot ask a New York court for
discovery to tell us where in the world there is
property upon which we can levy -- they don't want to
know about property where they can't levy.  They
don't want to know about property they can't execute, so
they're happy to write into that, even if it isn't
written, which they think it is, we're only talking
about property that we can seize.  No other property.
Now, you agree that we can go do that in
respect to property in California, Florida, and New
Mexico.  Well, in today's world we want the same
information about France, Italy, and Turkey.  And by the
way, we won't take one penny from those countries except
in accordance with the law of those countries, not a
penny.  We'll get the information, we'll go over and go
ask the court.  Now, why not?
MR. BLACKMAN:  The reason, besides the
language of the statute, is comity.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I didn't find
language in the statute that forbids it, but I'll look
that up again.  If the language is not an absolute
barrier, why not?
MR. BLACKMAN:  Well, first of all, the order
here, Your Honor, isn't limited to property that's
executable.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Let's assume we
go back and we say it has to be limited to property that
they have a right to obtain to under execution.  So
we're all agreed between the two of us we're going to do
that.  Now, why not?
MR. BLACKMAN:  Okay.  Well, we would welcome
very much --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Okay.  I'm
interested, though, about Turkey, France and --
MR. BLACKMAN:  The "why not" is because
logically, if you're thinking in terms of -- of the
statute, the statute doesn't distinguish between the
categories that I hope I heard the Court say you would
exclude, which the lower court here did not exclude and
which the plaintiff in fact was eagerly pursuing --
diplomatic, military, national security, et cetera.  The
statute doesn't distinguish between those categories of
nonexecutable property and property outside the United
States, which under the terms of the statute, 1609 and
1610, is equally nonexecutable.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if there were a
limitation -- if there were a limitation of that sort,
how would the district court possibly decide what could
be executed on?  And let's say there -- there are 40
countries where Argentina has property.  The district
court would have to look at 40 issues of foreign law;
could this be executed on in Turkey, in Italy, in
France, et cetera?
MR. BLACKMAN:  We would say no.  And that's
why it shouldn't get into that thicket.
JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  But you said your
fallback position was at least it should be limited to
property that could be -- on which there could be
execution in the country where the property is located.
How would the Court go about doing that?
MR. BLACKMAN:  I would impose, Justice
Alito, a bar that is consistent with international law
and practice, that discovery cannot extend under any
circumstances to diplomatic property, to military
property, to national security assets, to property of a
sitting or former head of state of a country, to state
officials, to entities other than --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We're waiting.  What about
property in another country?  We're waiting.
MR. BLACKMAN:  Okay.  After you've drawn
that line, I would submit that the bright line should
simply be if it's property that a U.S. court could
execute on that's fair game for tailored discovery.  But
we, I think, all agree that the U.S. court can't execute
on foreign property.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In saying that, are you
giving up the argument you started to make before
Justice Breyer gave you four ways?  You pointed out that
Rule 69, the discovery rule, says that -- that these
rules are subject -- "Statutes of the United States" --
the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is one -- "Statutes
of the United States, when applicable -- applicable,
govern under this rule," and then there's a slew of
examples of statutes that limit what you can attach,
what you can execute on.  I thought that that's --
that -- if that's right, then your answer now, well, as
long it's the same kind of property in France, the
answer would be the only thing you can discover relates
to property in the United States.
MR. BLACKMAN:  Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.
I was giving a potential fallback in the event that
the Court doesn't agree with that.  That is absolutely
Argentina's position.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if Argentina -- what if
Argentina were a private, a foreign company?  Could you
get -- could you have discovery of assets in other
countries under Rule 69.
MR. BLACKMAN:  That's a question this Court
has never actually addressed.  It doesn't -- and I don't
think you need to address it here because you have a
governing statute, as Justice Ginsburg said, which is
deliberately designed to restrict the scope vastly.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, wait, wait.
JUSTICE ALITO:  The scope of execution.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  The word -- there
are two different -- look at the rule.  Rule 69 talks in
(a) about execution of money judgments.  And in (a) it
talks about the need to conform to statute.  In (b) it
talks about obtaining discovery.  It doesn't say a word
about American statutes.  It talks about the rules and
statutes of the state, but it uses the word execution.
So if you're saying it means execution in the United
States and nowhere else, it applies to the private
plaintiff just as much as -- the private defendant just
as much as to the -- to the other defendant.
MR. BLACKMAN:  That would be a logical
reading.  I don't think the Court need --
JUSTICE BREYER:  If we need not, then I'm
back to my question:  Why not allow it with all these
qualifications?  And the only answer I've heard is from
Justice Alito, who says that it would be too complicated
to try to figure out all the laws of France and Turkey
in relation to execution.  Is there anything you want to
add to that before you sit down?
MR. BLACKMAN:  I want to add that, just as
the other slew of examples that I and Justice Ginsburg
were referring to deal with specific categories of
property that for good and sufficient reasons Congress
has exempted and, therefore, you don't get discovery
about them, the same is true of foreign state property.
And come back -- and I want to reserve time, with
the Court's permission, for rebuttal -- to the issue of
comity.  How can it be appropriate for a U.S. court to
be asking a foreign state to turn over information about
property that is beyond the execution powers of
the Court?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I found it extraordinary
that we did not have -- I think this is correct -- a
single brief from foreign countries.  They file all the
time when there is a case before us that they think
trenches upon their prerogatives.  Not a single foreign
country, maybe because Argentina owes them money as well
as it does these plaintiffs.
MR. BLACKMAN:  Justice Scalia, on the
question of owing money, one thing that's clear about
this statute is it's designed for uniform treatment of
states.  It doesn't single out based on how much money
you owe or how long the judgment is unpaid.  I mean-- That has to
be right.  This has to be a legal and evenhanded ruling,
and with all respect to Mr. Olson's rhetoric, which I'm
sure you're about to hear, it has nothing to do with
Argentina.  This is a rule for all states, which is why
the United States, talking about states, has supported
our position.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
Mr. Kneedler?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The sweeping discovery order sustained by
the Second Circuit, which establishes a district court
in the United States as a clearinghouse for all of
Argentina's assets and transactions throughout the
world, is contrary not only to the FSIA and its
purposes, but to the fundamental principles of comity
and international reciprocity on which it rests.  And I
want to point out that the United States --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.  I thought that the whole purpose of
the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was to protect us
from you, from the State Department and the government
coming in and saying, Oh, you know, in this case, grant
this one, deny that one.  I thought the whole purpose of
the FSIA was to enable us to look at the case and decide
it on the basis of the statute.
MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But now you're coming in
and saying, Oh, there are principles behind the statute
that we have to apply that extend -- extend the words of
the statute beyond what they say, and they say nothing
about -- about finding out the assets of people abroad.
MR. KNEEDLER:  Our position is that it is
the statute that controls.  The principles of comity and
reciprocity are ones that inform the interpretation of
the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What provision of the
statute controls here?
MR. KNEEDLER:  We think 1609, which
establishes an immunity from execution, and that
immunity from execution is subject to exceptions only
within the United States.  But more broadly, the
structure -- the entire structure of the FSIA is on
matters within the United States.  The exceptions from
immunity are for transactions --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you think the discovery
is certainly okay with respect to those commercial
interests on which the plaintiffs can execute?
MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, we do, and if it is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So this thing is a little
too broad.
MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  Within the United -- no,
within the United States.  We believe that it cannot
extend to property outside the United States.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why do you -- I'm
sorry.
MR. KNEEDLER:  If I could just --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you think they can't
go to France and-- with the American judgment and seek
commercial property there?  Let's assume, undisputed,
there's a piece of land that they're using for a
business purpose.
MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, and that would be a
matter for French courts to decide under French law.
But the United States would be gravely concerned about
an order of a trial court in a foreign country, entered
at the behest of a private person, seeking to establish
a clearinghouse in that country of all the United
States' assets for its many diplomatic, military,
intelligence --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How often do you think
the U.S. is going to default on paying a judgment and
have people chase it all around the world?
MR. KNEEDLER:  There are a number of
circumstances in which the United States would and some
in which it has.  The United States takes a strict view
that there has to be a service of process with 60-days
notice.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the questions from
the Court so far have narrowed the issue to property on
which there could be execution in a foreign -- if it
were in a foreign nation, and you said, Well, military
and consulate.  No, no.  We're talking about property
that if here would be subject to execution.  What's
wrong with asking the judgment debtor in this Court, in
this case, whether or not there are such assets, without
reference to military and government officials, et
cetera, property that's used in commercial transactions
on which there can be execution in the United States?
MR. KNEEDLER:  If the discovery is about
assets in the United States, but if -- we agree --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, discovery is about
assets that can be executed on, but they are in other
countries.  And you started saying, Oh, but the military
and so forth.  That's not -- that's not this case.
MR. KNEEDLER:  I was giving -- no, it is
this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's this case on
the or- -- but it's not -- it's not what the Court has
been suggesting.
MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  Our position is
basically a categorical one because, again, in the
reciprocal situation, the United States would be very
concerned about a foreign court setting itself up as a
clearinghouse for all United States' assets and
transactions around the world, whether or not --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Clearinghouse, we're trying
to get away from this issue by assuming out of the case
the military things, all those lists.  Then we're trying
to assume out of the case anything that isn't relevant
to an asset which you can attach and seize.  And now
we've got two sets.  In the United States everybody
agrees they can do it, and then there's a set abroad.
We have a statute we passed, a case, Intel, which says
that anybody in America can go -- you know, the Intel
case, anybody can go under 1728 and go ask a trial judge
to have the Los Angeles firm issue some discovery and
they are going to give that to the EU.  We aid their
judgments all the time.
So what's the principle?  What is wrong
where it's clear like that with a Court saying, We want
to find out if they have a supermarket chain in Sicily?
MR. KNEEDLER:  What is wrong with that is a
foreign sovereign is not the same as a foreign private
person.  The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act -- and
this is consistent with Article 19 of the UN Convention,
which establishes immunity of foreign states.  It
doesn't say with respect to property within the foreign
state.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why haven't foreign
countries protested?  Why aren't they here as amici?  Is
there a single foreign state that has taken your
position?
MR. KNEEDLER:  The State Department has
heard concerns from foreign countries, particularly
those that are --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why haven't they told us?
They have to ask you to pass it along?
MR. KNEEDLER:  I think they --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They file amicus briefs all
the time and if this is as horrific as you are painting
it, we would have had some briefs from them.
MR. KNEEDLER:  If we -- if we look at the
backdrop against which the FSIA was enacted, in 1952 the
United States adopted the restrictive theory of
sovereign immunity for liability, but it maintained,
even then, the absolute immunity from execution.  When
Congress passed the FSIA in 1976, it noted that
execution immunity was still somewhat controversial and
it did what the House report said was only partially
lift that immunity.
Well, prior to 1976, with an absolute
immunity from execution in the United States or abroad,
there could not have been any discovery.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I don't
have a very good understanding about how this works in
practice.  Let's say that the discovery request on a
French bank, the prevailing party has reason to believe
that this is where Argentina deposits its rental income
from properties around the United States.  They know,
they think they know, that Argentina has -- you know,
owns a townhouse that it rents out in the United States,
and they think they will be able to discover where that
is by going to the French bank account and saying, well,
every month they get $10,000 from this address in the
United States.  Can that be discovered or not?
MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  If it's assets within
the United States, it can be discovered, but we think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So they can -- so
the defendant that -- the prevailing party files a
request saying, give us anything that has anything to do
with assets in the United States on the French bank and
that's fine?
MR. KNEEDLER:  We think it should be more
narrowly tailored, the discovery --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you leave out the
diplomatic --
MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it has to be reasonably
tailored to uncover assets that could be subject to
execution.  But when the assets are abroad -- and I
would like to point out on Page 28 of the House Report,
which has been made something of in this case, the House
Report says "attachments in aid of execution," that
phrase is intended to include attachments, garnishments
and supplemental proceedings.  As Page 52 of the
respondent's brief points out, supplemental proceedings
include discovery of assets in aid of execution.  There
are several --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kneedler, can I take you
back to a question, I think it was Justice Alito who
asked it.  Assume that there was a suit between private
parties and the private party that won the judgment
thought that there were assets abroad.  Do you have any
question that the discovery rules would allow for
discovery of what the person had abroad?
MR. KNEEDLER:  We believe that Rule 69 would
allow that.  But as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, it's
the exemption in the FSIA which we believe is
categorical, and this House Report I was referring to
when it was talking about supplemental proceedings,
which includes discovery, says after it's
specifically referring to rule 69--
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's -- if you think
that Rule 69 allows that, I mean, my next question was
going to be what in the text would put a foreign
government in a different position than the -- than when
the suit involved only private parties?
MR. KNEEDLER:  I will talk about the text.
Just-- the point I wanted to make about the committee report is
it specifically says, the property in question, meaning
subject to supplemental proceedings, must be used for
commercial activity in the United States.  Congress's
understanding of the statute it passed was that it had
to do with assets in the United States and it comes --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  What in the text -- what in
the text puts you in a different position -- if you have
that view of 69, which extends abroad as well as within
the United States, what in the text would suggest that
we're not under that rule?
MR. KNEEDLER:  1610's exceptions from
execution immunity are limited all to things within the
United States.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But isn't the logical reason
for that -- why would Congress pass a law limiting
execution on property in another country where there's
no United States jurisdiction?  How do you infer from
that a desire to limit discovery?
MR. KNEEDLER:  It's true that the writs of
U.S. courts do not run to foreign countries.  But it
isn't -- when it comes to a foreign sovereign, that
limitation is not just one of the writ not running as a
matter of the District Court's jurisdiction.  It is also
a matter of the immunity of the foreign sovereign, and
this is the same point that comes with respect to
immunity from liability.
That is both jurisdictional of the Court,
but it is a substantive immunity for the foreign
sovereign, and we think the same thing is true with
respect to execution abroad.  There is an immunity from
that and, therefore, an immunity from discovery.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just one question.  I
thought that I would hear a lot about waiver in this
case.  Does the waiver in the bonds not affect this case
or its outcome?
MR. KNEEDLER:  It does not because
Section 1610 requires that the only property subject to
execution is property within the United States used for
commercial purposes, and that's true even when there is
a waiver.  That's the threshold, and then there are
various categories and waiver is one of them so that the
property still must be used for commercial purposes
within the United States.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
Mr. Olson?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. OLSON:  Thank you.
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:
I would like to start with something that
Mr. Kneedler has been talking about.  He referred to the
House Report three or four times during his argument
today, and he referred to it six times in his brief.
He did not mention Page 23, the top of which
says, "This bill, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act,
does not attempt to deal with questions of discovery.
Existing law appears to be adequate in this area, for
example..."  And then there are privileges that could be
raised.  That is a piece of the legislative history that
the United States apparently has forgotten completely
about.
Secondly, the United States has said that
there's a common law backdrop to the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act dealing with discovery in aid of
execution, yet this Court, four years ago in the
Samantar case says indisputably the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act displaces the common law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, Mr. Olson, you have
said -- you make this distinction between the exemption
in the Act and what can be discovered.  But the
discovery rule itself, the advisory committee, the note
on the original drafting of the discovery rule says,
"Statutes of the United States on execution," and
certainly the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is a
statute of the United States on execution, "govern under
this rule."  And in case you don't get the point, it
lists, oh, a few dozen statutes.  For example, it says
that you can't execute -- assign, execute, levy or issue
other legal process against a Federal employee's
retirement annuities.  And there are all kinds of
provisions, substantive provisions limiting what
property is subject to execution.
MR. OLSON:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  This
case is not about execution.
out information --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:
discovery rule.
MR. OLSON:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:
This case is about finding
But this is a note to the
It says that Rule 69, the
discovery rule, is subject to statutes on execution.
MR. OLSON:  But, 69(a)(2), as one of
your colleagues pointed out, is the discovery in aid of
execution.  It provides the right to obtain information
with respect to that -- that might be under the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure which were not displaced by the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and all we're talking
about here is information -- I should start with the
fact that this -- the context of this case is that
Argentina was able to sell bonds and to raise money in
the United States, on the capital markets of the United
States, only by agreeing to be bound by U.S. law, to be
sued in and subject to the judgments of U.S. courts, and
by waiving sovereign immunity and consenting to
attachment in aid of execution.
And there's even a reference in that waiver,
which was drafted for Argentina by sophisticated New
York counsel, in order to obtain money in the United
States had -- had Argentina said, and we won't pay the
judgments, we won't obey the orders of the United States
courts, we will resist discovery when we spirit money
outside of the United States, we will do all of those
things, it would never have been able to borrow any
money in the United States.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What exactly does
that have to do with the issues before this case?
MR. OLSON:  Because exactly, Mr. Chief
Justice, that's the context of why my clients are
attempting to seek information with respect to where
Argentina has moved its assets, the lower courts, the
district court--
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me that
that context is totally irrelevant.  You have a
question, it doesn't matter what the basis of the
underlying judgement is.  The question is one of
discovery.
MR. OLSON:  Yes.  And in every instance when
someone is attempting to execute on a judgment to pay --
there is no question it was jurisdiction of the Court to
issue the judgments, the judgments are valid and
binding.  Now the -- the creditors are attempting to
find out where the assets are, there's a history in this
case, and it could be in any other case.  That's why
it's a question of general application, every creditor,
judgment creditor is looking for the assets of the
judgment debtor and many judgment debtors move those
assets around in order to avoid having to pay the
judgment.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Olson, but this is a
sovereign, and as I understand the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act, it says “execution, the foreign sovereign
has immunity, has immunity except -- except when we're
dealing with commercial property in the United States.”
So the statute starts with a blanket immunity against
execution for the foreign sovereign and then says, but
there is an exception for property -- commercial
property in the United States.
MR. OLSON:  Well, there's several answers to
that.  First of all, Section 1606 of the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act, which is not mentioned in the
government's brief at all and the government
specifically takes the district judge to task for
treating Argentina like a private litigant, Section 1606
says if jurisdiction is established, the foreign state
shall be liable in the same manner and to the same
extent as a private individual under like circumstances.
So the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act specifically
said that once jurisdiction is established, and was not
unquestionably established here, Argentina is to be
treated to the same manner and to the same extent as a
private litigant.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that that goes
to jurisdiction and liability, the judgment of
liability.  Then there's a separate section on
execution.  And those two are not the same.  You can
have full authority to issue a judgment against
Argentina.  The execution portions of the statute are
1609 to 11, not 1606.
MR. OLSON:  That's exactly correct,
Justice Ginsburg.  And when it comes time to execute on
property identified by Argentina -- it's actually -- the
discovery is not addressed to Argentina.  It is
addressed to third-party banks.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could it be addressed to
Argentina on your theory?  I think it could.
MR. OLSON:  We believe that it could be
addressed to Argentina, no question.  But this
particular case comes to you where the discovery is
addressed to non-sovereigns who have not appealed and
who are complying with the order pursuant to what the
District Court did.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought they objected
to it.  Didn't the banks object?
MR. OLSON:  Pardon me, Your Honor?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The banks, I thought that
they objected to the subpoena.
MR. OLSON:  One of the parties objected to
the subpoena.  There were objections going back and
forth.  There was a narrowing of the scope of the
subpoena.  The subpoenas themselves may be found -- and
it's not for all of the terrible things that my
colleague has mentioned, they are on the Joint Appendix
of 54 and 55 and 91.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It doesn't seem to me
that the narrowing was -- we've been assuming that what
we're talking about is discovery related to commercial
property.  But the subpoena is written much more broadly
than that.  It's asking for every piece of property that
Argentina has anywhere in the world.
MR. OLSON:  It's asking for bank
transactions, Justice Sotomayor.  And the reason for
that is, we do not know, and Argentina has provided
plenty of reason for us to be suspicious, as to where
property is, how it's denominated, what it's being used
for.  If it is a piece of commercial -- if it's an
airline that says Argentine Air Force on the side of it,
it still could be commercial property.  We need to know
what those assets are.  The purpose for discovery is to
find what the assets are, where they are, what they're
being used for, where they moved, when they moved.  And
that's why the bank subpoenas, which the banks are
complying with and the banks have not objected to and
the banks are not sovereigns, notwithstanding my
colleague has now said not in the lower courts, but in
this Court, that BNA, one of the banks is a sovereign,
but it has not claimed sovereign immunity and it has not
appeared here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.
Finish --
MR. OLSON:  I just -- the answer would be
that if you don't know what Argentina is doing with the
property and what labels it's slapping on the
property --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I was right.  This is
doing exactly what the Solicitor General is saying, it
is asking for an accounting of everything that Argentina
owns regardless of what its purpose is.
MR. OLSON:  It is -- well, we don't know
what its purpose is until we find out what the
assets are.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So just answer yes.
MR. OLSON:  Yes, the answer is yes.  And
there's a reason for it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but doesn't
that seem pretty extraordinary?  You just said you can
get a discovery about a plane that says Argentine Air
Force on the side of it.  That seems, to me, to go to
the heart of what the Deputy Solicitor General was
talking about.  That's pretty intrusive at a sovereign
level to say you can find out how many jet fighters
Argentina happens to have.
MR. OLSON:  Well, what -- this subpoena
relates to bank transactions.  If there-- and as the legislative
history that I referred to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just before you get
over there, I thought your position was that yes, you
can ask for discovery related to, you know, the
Argentine Air Force.
MR. OLSON:  That's what the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure provide, that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Could we say no to that and
just say, look, here is the difficult question in the
case, of course, every subpoena -- every subpoena has to
have limits, and the limits are typically limits that
have to do with the purpose of the subpoena, and where a
sovereign is involved, maybe a District Court has to be
more careful, but you are indeed searching for
information in respect to assets out of the country that
you could execute upon?  Make that assumption with me
for a second.
MR. OLSON:  I understand.
JUSTICE BREYER:  If you want to fight it
later, go right ahead.  But I have a question I'm trying
to get to, and it is this, on that assumption, and we're
only talking about butcher shops in Italy, there's
marvelous Argentine beef, it's delicious.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's the kind of
thing you want to levy on.  Okay.  Fine.  Now, if there
were property in the United States and it were against a
private person, another private person could get the
information.  If it was against a sovereign, the private
person could get the information.  If it's abroad and
the shops are in Sicily, a private person can get the
information despite the fact that to know about levying,
you may have to know a lot about Italian law.  Now, if
it is a sovereign that you are trying to get the
information, the other side is saying that's different.
You say, why?  Why -- I knew you were going to say why.
And the answer is going to be because there could be
various interferences.  We can't even tell you exactly
what.  But you're talking about every country in the
world.  Who knows?
Now, assume that there is something to their
answer.  Then where are we legally?  We may be back A,
before the Tate letter, in which case we could say to
the State Department, if you see such a problem, come in
and tell us, or we could say to the District Courts, go
ask the State Department case by case.  If Congress
wants to make a rule later, they can, but they haven't
yet.  Or we could say something else.  That's the
question -- those are the questions that I would like
answered.
MR. OLSON:  Well, and part of the answer is
in the Altmann decision itself where you specifically
said the views of the United States with respect to the
construction of a statute of the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act, are not entitled to deference.  If there
is objection by the State Department with respect to a
particular interest, a particular party, a particular
situation, it can set that forth.  Instead, what the
United States has done is filed a brief with respect to
the construction of the statute.
And the other answer, Justice Breyer, is
specifically set out, if there are objections of that
nature, diplomatic objections, sovereignty objections
with respect to a particular official, again the
legislative history, and I know this may not be
persuasive to everyone here, but it's something that the
United States referred to as persuasive in its brief,
this Court found it persuasive in part in the Samantar
case four years ago.  It specifically says if there are
those kind of objections, they are addressed to the
District Court, and the District Court can address them
and subject to an abuse of discretion standard.  So it's
all right here.  It's what Congress was intending.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Olson, can I just make
sure I understand the scope of your argument?  I mean,
suppose there were some countries that executed on
assets that in the United States would be nonexecutable.
So suppose there were some countries that would execute
on military assets or diplomatic assets or so forth.
And somebody came into a U.S. court and said I want
discovery about those assets, because after all, they
are going to let me execute -- these other countries are
going to let me execute on them.  It's in aid of the
judgment, so it fits within the discovery rules.  What
should the United States say to a -- a United States
court say to a request like that, fine?
MR. OLSON:  Yes.  Because what you're
seeking is information about the assets.  You are not
executing on the asset.  And if the United States law
said that that would be extraterritorial application, if
it said you can't -- we're going to inhibit your ability
to accomplish an execution or an attachment but is
pursuant to the laws of a foreign country, pursuant to
decisions of a foreign tribunal, that would be the
extraterritorial application.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that makes it a lot
harder for me because I thought you just looked to the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  And anything that is
executable in this country under that, you can get
information on to try to execute abroad.  But you are
saying, oh, no, it's more than that, it's stuff that you
couldn't execute on in this country, but that some
foreign countries will let you execute on.  What am I
supposed to do, look at the law of all of these
countries?
MR. OLSON:  No, no.  That's the purpose of
discovery, Justice Scalia, so that the judgment creditor
can find out what the assets are, and then it -- it can
go to the courts of this country or the courts of
another country and to comply --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it includes military
assets, diplomatic assets, everything?
MR. OLSON:  Probably under-- diplomatic assets
are covered by a separate convention, as we mentioned in
our brief.  Diplomatic assets and consulate affairs --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Military assets?
MR. OLSON:  Military assets.  Even
Section 1611 of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
only exempts certain military aspects -- military
property.  It has to be being used for military purpose
and so forth.  So if you find out something that isn't
within the scope of that exemption, then you can execute
on it even in this country.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  I'm saying it is
within the scope.  It does -- it is those limited
military assets that you cannot execute on in this
country.  And you are saying, well, so long as we can do
it abroad, we --
MR. OLSON:  The problem, Justice Scalia, as
any litigant knows, you don't know what the judgment
debtor is doing with its assets.  You don't know whether
it's disguising its assets.  You don't know --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no, no.  But assume
the validity of the question.  Does it -- why is it that
your position applies to military assets if that is --
that is beyond the scope of the Court's power here, but
on the assumption of Justice Scalia's question it's
within, and of your hypothetical, that it's subject to
execution in France?
MR. OLSON:  The answer to that is, to the
extent that there's a specific objection with respect to
a scope -- the scope of the discovery, it can be
addressed by the district court as opposed to a blanket
prohibition on finding out information with respect to a
judgment debtor who has --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in making the rule,
we're asking whether or not our rule should take account
of this concern.  And you say, well, it's up to the
district court.  We're going to tell the district court
what to do.  So what do we say on this point?
MR. OLSON:  I think what you should say to
the DISTRICT court is what the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, which were not replaced by the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act, do.  If it's relevant to the
subject matter or a defense of the action, as under --
pursuant to Rule 69(a)(2) and Rule 26, then it's
something that there may be specific objections or
specific concerns, but the Federal Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act did not replace the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure.  It didn't intend --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And they are statutes and
the rule, whether you divide it into the two parts, the
substance was the same.  The rule says you look to
statutes of the United States.  I don't know how -- I
don't know how you get around the fact that the
discovery rule itself says that the statutes of the
United States are relevant.
MR. OLSON:  It says the discovery rule, Rule
69(a)(2) says the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm talking about
Advisory Committee notes.
MR. OLSON:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What they meant.  And
they meant that the discovery -- that there isn't a
world where we have statutes and then the Federal Rules.
There is an interplay between the two, and that's what
the Advisory Committee that drafted the rule told us
about it.
MR. OLSON:  And I think that with respect to
that, that provision, those statements of the Advisory
Committee have to take -- be taken in the context that
the statute itself did not intend to address discovery
that's quite clear.  Section 69(a)(2) specifically says
as provided in these rules or by the procedure of the
state in which the court is located.  As the Second
Circuit specifically said, the rules in -- the laws in
the State of New York and the rules in -- and the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, discovery in aid of
execution is very broad and it may go to any person,
and if you meet the relevant standard anywhere the
property may be located.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's assume -- let's
assume that New York has an exemption from -- from
levying on property.  It says homestead, you can't levy
on homestead.  But Florida does not have that exemption.
Can you, getting a judgment in a New York State court,
seek to discover what homestead property the defendant
has elsewhere?
MR. OLSON:  Well, you assume the answer in
the question that you asked, Justice Scalia.  We don't
know whether it's properly subject to a homestead until
we find out how many homes, where they are, who owns
them, what they're being used for.  The rules are that
then you can --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Come on.  I'm doing the
hypothetical, okay?  And my hypothetical is the
discovery is what homes do you own in other states?
MR. OLSON:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The same language as the
New York statute --
MR. OLSON:  I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which exempts those
homes.
MR. OLSON:  I submit --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay?
MR. OLSON:  I submit that the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure would allow a judgment creditor to
ask the bank or other persons or even the judgment
debtor, what homes do you own, yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you think you can levy
on those homes --
MR. OLSON:  No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- in Florida even though
New York wouldn't let you do it?
MR. OLSON:  You could levy on those homes in
Florida if Florida allows you to do so, yes.  You can
take that judgment in New York and go to Florida and
seek the enforcement or execution of that judgment.
This is the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a judgment limited to
property other than homesteads.  You take that judgment
to Florida, it doesn't expand.  It's the same judgment.
MR. OLSON:  Yes.  It's a judgment for money
due.  You borrowed money, you didn't pay it back, and
you have a judgment that entitles you to recover that
money.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But not from -- not from
homesteads.
MR. OLSON:  Well, if that's your
hypothetical, that the judgment exempts homesteads, I
don't know whether the -- whether -- that gets pretty
far afield here.  We're talking --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  When you say you can't
execute on homestead property, it means any judgment in
New York excludes homesteads.
MR. OLSON:  A judgment creditor who has a
bond in New York City and has -- and the debtor refuses
to pay it and gets a judgment from a court which has
jurisdiction, then can take that judgment and go to
other places where there is property located and execute
or attach on that property depending upon the laws --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Olson, what --
MR. OLSON:  -- of that jurisdiction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- what about, there are
countries that have more restrictive views than we do
about what information, financial information, is
confidential.  So this omnibus order says worldwide, we
want to know what property worldwide.  And suppose the
country in which the property is located says:  In our
system, this property is – if the information -- the
information that was sought from the bank was confidential.  What
then?
MR. OLSON:  This Court -- I think it's the
Société Nationale case -- has said that a court can
order discovery even with respect to where the person to
whom the discovery is addressed says I can't give you
that information.  The case that your Court decided
involved Mexico, and the party claimed that, the laws of
Mexico will not let me provide that information.  This
Court held that, yes, indeed the courts of the United
States may require the production of that information.
I think it's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you do this in
discovery normally?  Can't someone go in and say I don't
think -- I think the subpoena or this order is too
broad.  It will do da, da, da.  There isn't that much
need for it.  Please don't do it, judge.  And the judge
has a lot of discretion to say no.
MR. OLSON:  Exactly.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, is there
any objection on your part, which there may well be, if
we were to say one of the problems here is that this
order, although they may have reason for it, is
requiring discovery of airplanes, it's requiring
discovery of consulates, it's requiring discovery of all
of these other things, things that at least
presumptively our statutes would not allow them to
execute upon.  Before you give an order allowing
discovery of that kind of thing, judge, you'd better
have very good reason for it.
MR. OLSON:  Well, that's -- you are talking
about an abuse of discretion standard, and when you talk
about airplanes that may they be used for commercial
purposes, this Court has held --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I'm not saying that --
no.  I'm just saying where it is on its face something
that couldn't be discovered.
MR. OLSON:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Something that couldn't be
executed upon.
MR. OLSON:  In this country, I think the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Be very, very careful.  We
do those things, and they are very often ignored, but
nonetheless --
MR. OLSON:  The district court went through
an elaborate process.  It narrowed the scope of the
subpoenas with respect to property in Argentina.  It
narrowed the scope of the subpoenas with respect to the
persons identified in the subpoenas.  It responded to
concerns about that.  It made itself available to
narrowing the scope of things.  Argentina decided to
make a blanket objection to any information other than
information with respect to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Olson.
MR. OLSON:  -- assets that could be levied
on in the United States, and that we think is not the
correct interpretation of the FSIA or the Federal Rules.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If I am understanding
your position, you -- I think what you are saying, the
judgment here is only for money due, whatever the amount
was.  And that's the judgment you have.  How you get
that judgment paid depends on where the assets are
located, correct?
MR. OLSON:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so any -- any
protection to those assets has to be provided by the
jurisdiction in which they're located.
MR. OLSON:  That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your position,
whether this is a sovereign or an individual, is that if
they get a homestead exemption in New York, if the
property is in New York, they're entitled to it, but if
they have property in Florida and Florida doesn't give a
homestead exemption, they can get that home -- they
can't get the home in New York, but they can get the
home in Florida.
MR. OLSON:  Exactly.  And if I haven't said
that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so in answer to
Justice Kagan's question, even though there might be a
country out there that doesn't make any property immune
by a sovereign, then you could go and attach any
property in that country?
MR. OLSON:  To the extent-- Exactly.  I think I understand
completely your question.  My answer is precisely the
ability to attach or levy is dependent upon the law where
the place the property is located and there are many
jurisdictions that cover different things and we're
dealing with judgment debtors, which is -- and it's true
across the board, Justice Scalia.  The judgment debtors
may be doing all sorts of things to avoid execution or
avoid paying their debts.  In this case we have specific
findings by the courts below that Argentina has ample
resources to pay these debts.  It submitted to
jurisdiction.  It specifically stated that it will not
obey the orders of the courts of the United States,
including presumably any decision from this Court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many of the
bondholders settled with Argentina?  My understanding is
the vast majority of them did.
MR. OLSON:  I'm --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The vast majority of the
bondholders settled with Argentina.
MR. OLSON:  Yes, because anybody who has
ever litigated against Argentina knows that it probably
may be less costly to just give in on whatever terms
Argentina offers.  But the fact is that these are debts
undeniably due and owing, sovereign immunity was waived,
and I must emphasize the provision about the waiver
provisions which are in sections -- joint appendix 106
and 107, are as broad as the law allows, and they waive
immunity from suit, they consent to suit, they waived
the Sovereign Immunities Act and even at the last few
lines of the waiver it specifically talks about
execution in foreign countries.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  If you win on the
categorical question that's presented here, do you think
it's still open to Argentina to go back to the district
court and to say, modify your ruling for this or that
privilege reason or because the order is overinclusive
or any of these more prudential considerations.
MR. OLSON:  Yes, I believe that's the case,
Your Honor.  Discovery is a continuing process, although
substantially the discovery demands have been met so
far, but it's a continuing process.  There -- there can
be objections before with respect to, wait a minute,
that's our ambassador.  Of course other laws cover that
sort of thing, and the judge was very careful about that
sort of thing.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What exactly would a
district judge do in those circumstances?  So you --
Argentina says this, this is military property.  And
what would the judge inquire?  What would the judge do
before deciding whether to allow discovery of something
like that?  Would it look -- would it look to the law of
the country where the property is located?  Would it
make some kind of factual inquiry as to whether it
really is military?  What would go on?
MR. OLSON:  I think the judge might ask for
some assurances that, from Argentina, that you are
telling the truth this time, that that's -- these are
really military assets and not something disguised as
military assets.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does the waiver extend to
military property?
MR. OLSON:  The waiver extends as far as the
law will permit, and we submit that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, then the waiver just
restates the immunity that's provided in the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act.
MR. OLSON:  No.  The waiver --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How does it go beyond
that?
MR. OLSON:  It waives the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act defenses.  It waives immunity from --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But not as to military
property.  So how do I know how far the waiver extends?
MR. OLSON:  The waiver extends to anything
that -- Argentina has decided that in order to borrow
money in this country it had the sovereign right to
waive sovereign immunity under the laws of the United
States.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm asking whether or not
the waiver extends to Argentine military property.
MR. OLSON:  I believe that it does, Justice
Kennedy, because if you -- if you construed the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act of prohibiting a foreign
sovereign from waiving its immunity, you would cripple a
foreign sovereign from deciding that, I need to borrow
money and in order to borrow money --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does it waive immunity as
to a consular residence or an embassy building?
MR. OLSON:  I think it depends upon the
circumstances, but there is a separate treaty that
covers consular affairs that is different than this,
that does provide immunity.  And we're not talking about
any of those things.  We're talking about bank
transactions which are covered by the subpoena to allow
a judgment creditor that has a judgment over Argentina,
and Argentina is not asking to be treated like a private
citizen as the law requires.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
Mr. Blackman, you have 3 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN I. BLACKMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BLACKMAN:  Thank you.  First, in answer
to Justice Kagan's question about going back, based on
the decision below in the next round the district court
specifically said:  I don't care about limitation to
diplomatic, I don't care about limitation to military.
He said those might otherwise be good arguments, but the
Second Circuit has already passed upon that and the FSIA
doesn't apply.  Full stop.  So it's a chimera to think
that the district court is going to fix this.  This
Court has to fix it.
Secondly, just to go to Mr. Olson's point,
these subpoenas, and I'm reading from JA-56, has as its
catch-all, paragraph 12, "each asset or property of any
kind whatsoever which Argentina owns."  And then it goes
on for pages to list things that are supposedly within
the definition of "Argentina," including the ministry of
foreign affairs, the ministry of defense and the
national strategic military intelligence directorate.
So Justice Sotomayor was absolutely right, this covers
everything and the Second Circuit said that everything
is fair game.
On the broader points of the statute, the
FSIA, as this Court has held in the Amerada Hess case,
in Verlinden, and virtually every case you've decided
from Verlinden, which is the first one, is that this is
the comprehensive basis on which U.S. courts exercise
power over foreign states.  And as Justice Ginsburg
pointed out, that power is very sharply broken down
between the broader power of jurisdiction to adjudicate,
which is what 1606 says -- once there is jurisdiction to
adjudicate, you are treated for purposes of that
adjudication like anyone else, and the much more limited
power to execute.  And the legislative history
specifically says that the phrase in the statute in
1610(a) of "attachment in aid of execution" as opposed
to "execution," which is a separate word there, and
"attachment" is a separate word there.  "Attachment in
aid of execution" means the whole panoply of
supplemental procedures that a court can use to assist
in execution.
Discovery in aid of execution, as the
language indicates in Rule 69, is one of those
procedures.  There's no justification for saying that
that means goes way beyond the allowable end.  Otherwise
you not only have the tail of discovery kind of wagging
the substantive dog; you have a tail that's cut off from
the dog.  It's floating around in the ether.  We can
take discovery of anything no matter if it's conceivably
within the reasonable scope of execution and the power
that the Federal court has or not.  We think that's
wrong and we ask the Court to reverse it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
