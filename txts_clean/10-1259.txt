CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 10-1259, United States v.
Jones.
Mr. Dreeben.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Since this Court's decision in Katz v.
United States, the Court has recognized a basic
dichotomy under the Fourth Amendment. What a person
seeks to preserve as private in the enclave of his own
home or in a private letter or inside of his vehicle
when he is traveling is a subject of Fourth Amendment
protection. But what he reveals to the world, such as
his movements in a car on a public roadway, is not.
In Knotts v. United States, this Court
applied that principle to hold that visual and beeper
surveillance of a vehicle traveling on the public
roadways infringed no Fourth Amendment expectation of
privacy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Knotts, though,
seems to me much more like traditional surveillance.
You're following the car, and the beeper just helps you
follow it from a -- from a slightly greater distance.
That was 30 years ago. The technology is very
different, and you get a lot more information from the
GPS surveillance than you do from following a beeper.
MR. DREEBEN: The technology is different,
Mr. Chief Justice, but a crucial fact in Knotts that
shows that this was not simply amplified visual
surveillance is that the officers actually feared
detection in Knotts as the car crossed from Minnesota to
Wisconsin. The driver began to do certain U-turns and,
the police broke off visual surveillance. They lost
track of the car for a full hour. They only were able
to discover it by having a beeper receiver in a
helicopter that detected the beeps from the radio
transmitter in the can of chloroform.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a good
example of the change in technology. That's a lot of
work to follow the car. They've got to listen to the
beeper; when they lose it, they've got to call in the
helicopter. Here they just sit back in the station, and
they -- they push a button whenever they want to find
out where the car is. They look at data from a month
and find out everywhere it's been in the past month.
That -- that seems to me dramatically different.
MR. DREEBEN: But it doesn't expose
anything, Mr. Chief Justice, that isn't already exposed
to public view for anyone who wanted to watch, and that
was the crucial principle that the Court applied --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under that
rationale, could you put a beeper surreptitiously on the
man's overcoat or sport coat?
MR. DREEBEN: Probably not, Justice Kennedy;
and the reason is that this Court in Karo v. United
States -- United States v. Karo -- specifically
distinguished the possibility of following a car on a
public roadways from determining the location of an
object in a place where a person has a reasonable
expectation of privacy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, no. This is a special
device. It measures only streets and public elevators
and public buildings.
MR. DREEBEN: In that event, Justice
Kennedy, there is a serious question about whether the
installation of such a device would implicate either a
search or a seizure. But if it did not, the public
movements of somebody do not implicate a seizure.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- and on that latter
point, you might just be aware that I have serious
reservations that there wasn't -- that there -- about
the way in which this beeper was installed. But you can
get to that at -- at your convenience.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, I'd like to
get to it now.
(Laughter.)
MR. DREEBEN: Happy to, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I have to give a little
prologue to my question. When -- when wiretapping first
came before this Court, we held that it was not a
violation of the Fourth Amendment because the Fourth
Amendment says that the -- the people shall be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects against
unreasonable searches and seizures. And wiretapping
just picked up conversations. That's not persons,
houses, papers, and effects.
Later on, we reversed ourselves, and, as you
mentioned, Katz established the new criterion, which is,
is there an invasion of privacy? Does -- are you
obtaining information that a person had a reasonable
expectation to be kept private? I think that was wrong.
I don't think that was the original meaning of the
Fourth Amendment. But, nonetheless, it's been around
for so long, we're not going to overrule that.
However, it is one thing to add that privacy
concept to the Fourth Amendment as it originally
existed, and it is quite something else to use that
concept to narrow the Fourth Amendment from what it
originally meant. And it seems to me that when that
device is installed against the will of the owner of the
car on the car, that is unquestionably a trespass and
thereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his
effects -- the car is one of his effects -- against an
unreasonable search and seizure. It is attached to the
car against his will, and it is a search because what it
obtains is the location of that car from there forward.
Now, why -- why isn't that correct? Do you deny that
it's a trespass?
MR. DREEBEN: It may be a technical
trespass, but it was equally a technical trespass in the
United States v. Karo, when a can of ether was
transferred to somebody that had -- and it had a radio
transmitter --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the owner of the
can at the time it was installed consented, and that is
not this case. There is no consent by the owner of the
property to which this device was affixed. In fact, it
was done, as Justice Scalia indicated, surreptitiously.
MR. DREEBEN: But there was no consent to
the owner of the can once he acquired it to have it
contain a foreign item installed by the government.
And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's too bad. That
doesn't make it a trespass. I mean --
MR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court thought that
it --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It may be a sneaky thing to
do, but -- but every sneaky thing is not a trespass.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court thought that
it was a technical trespass in Karo and said that made
no difference because the purpose of the Fourth
Amendment is to protect privacy interests and meaningful
interferences with possessory interests, not to cover
all technical trespasses. And the case that I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So, we've narrowed the
Fourth Amendment?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think the Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So, the -- the privacy
rationale doesn't expand it but narrows it in some
respects.
MR. DREEBEN: It changes it, Justice Scalia.
And I think the case that most clearly illustrates the
distinction between trespass and Fourth Amendment
protection is Oliver v. United States, the case that
reaffirmed the open fields doctrine. In that case,
there was absolutely no doubt that the police committed
a trespass under local law.  They entered, they crossed
fences, they ignored big "no trespassing" signs; and
this Court held that the interests that are protected by
trespass law are distinct from the interests protected
by the Fourth Amendment.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Undoubtedly, but the
rationale of that case was that it was not an
unreasonable --
MR. DREEBEN: No, the rationale was that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it was not an
unreasonable search.
MR. DREEBEN: -- there was no search,
Justice Scalia. The rationale of that case was that
open fields are not among the things that are protected
by the Fourth Amendment. And the Court was very
specifically focused on the distinction between trespass
law and Fourth Amendment law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think there
would also not be a search if you put a GPS device on
all of our cars, monitored our movements for a month?
You think you're entitled to do that under your theory?
MR. DREEBEN: The Justices of this Court?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.
(Laughter.)
MR. DREEBEN: Under our theory and under
this Court's cases, the Justices of this Court when
driving on public roadways have no greater expectation
of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your answer is
yes, you could tomorrow decide that you put a GPS device
on every one of our cars, follow us for a month; no
problem under the Constitution?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, equally, Mr. Chief
Justice, if the FBI wanted to, it could put a team of
surveillance agents around the clock on any individual
and follow that individual's movements as they went
around on the public streets, and they would thereby
gather --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that seems to get --
to me to get to what's really involved here. The issue
of whether there's a technical trespass or not is
potentially a ground for deciding this particular case,
but it seems to me the heart of the problem that's
presented by this case and will be presented by other
cases involving new technology is that in the
pre-computer, pre-Internet age, much of the privacy -- I
would say most of the privacy -- that people enjoyed was
not the result of legal protections or constitutional
protections; it was the result simply of the difficulty
of traveling around and gathering up information.
But with computers, it's now so simple to
amass an enormous amount of information about people
that consists of things that could have been observed on
the streets, information that was made available to the
public. If -- if this case is decided on the ground
that there was a technical trespass, I don't have much
doubt that in the near future, it will be possible -- I
think it's possible now in many instances -- for law
enforcement to monitor people's movements on -- on
public streets without committing a technical trespass.
So, how do we deal with this? Do we just
say, well, nothing is changed, so that all the
information that people expose to the public is -- is
fair game? There's no -- there's no search or seizure
when that is -- when that is obtained because there
isn't a reasonable expectation of privacy, but isn't
there a real change in -- in this regard?
MR. DREEBEN: I don't think, Justice Alito,
that there's a particularly dramatic change in this case
from what went on in the Karo and the Knotts cases.
It is possible to envision broader advances
in technology that would allow more public information
to be amassed and put into computer systems. But I
think that the remedy for that -- if this Court agrees
with the principles in Knotts and Karo and applies them
to this case, the remedy is through legislation, just as
when the Court held that amassing pen register data, all
of the numbers that you dial on your telephone, the
lengths of the times of the calls. The Court was
confronted in that case with Justice Stewart's view in
dissent, that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a third party
involved in the telephone -- in the pen register case.
And, here, it's the police. Essentially, I think you
answered the question that the government's position
would mean that any of us could be monitored whenever we
leave our homes. So, the only thing secure is the home.
Is -- I mean, that is -- that is the end point of your
argument, that an electronic device, as long as it's not
used inside the house, is okay.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, we're talking here about
monitoring somebody's movements in public. We're not
talking about monitoring their conversations, their
telephone calls, the interior of their cars, their
private letters or packages. So, there are enclaves of
Fourth Amendment protection that this Court has
recognized.
JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is the
question that I think people are driving at, at least as
I understand them and certainly share the concern, is
that if you win this case, then there is nothing to
prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24
hours a day the public movement of every citizen of the
United States. And -- and the difference between the
monitoring and what happened in the past is memories are
fallible; computers aren't.
And no one, or at least very rarely, sends
human beings to follow people 24 hours a day. That
occasionally happens. But with the machines, you can.
So, if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like
1984 from their brief. I understand they have an
interest in perhaps dramatizing that, but -- but maybe
overly. But it still sounds like it.
And so, what protection is there, if any,
once we accept your view of the case, from this slight
futuristic scenario that's just been painted and is done
more so in their briefs?
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, first of all,
this is exactly the argument that was presented to the
Court in Knotts. If you go back to 1983, the beeper
technology in that case seemed extraordinarily advanced,
and there was a potential for it to be used. The
Respondent --
JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, that's true.
And they do have a limit. In this case, they say Knotts
involved a single journey, or let's say it involved four
journeys. And let's say it involved four journeys in
2 days.  This involves every journey for a month. So,
they say whatever the line is that's going to protect
us, it's short of every journey in a month.
So, I'm not asking -- I'm saying I accept
your point there. And what do you say is the limit?
MR. DREEBEN: I first want to address the
suggestion that you could draw a line somewhere between
a month and a trip and have a workable standard for
police officers to use. Police officers use a variety
of investigative techniques which in the aggregate
produce an enormous amount of information. Pen
registers, trash pulls. They look at financial records.
They conduct visual surveillance. And under a principle
of law that says 1 trip is okay but 30 trips is not,
there is absolutely no guidance for law enforcement in
how they are --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is the same
kind of guidance that you have in any case of this Court
that uses the technique which is used sometimes, and I
think it's used for example in the bribing the judge
case, you know, with campaign contributions. You draw
an outer limit, you say you can't go beyond that. We
know within that, there is no standard. We'll leave it
for the lower courts to work out, and we'll review it
over time.
That's not necessarily desirable, but that
is a method this Court has sometimes used.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I --
JUSTICE BREYER: But even if it's wrong, I
want to know, are you saying there is no limit or are
you suggesting one?
MR. DREEBEN: I'm suggesting that the Court
do the same thing that it did in Knotts. This case does
not involve 24-hour surveillance of every citizen of the
United States. It involves following one suspected drug
dealer as to whom there was very strong suspicion, for a
period of time that actually is less than a month,
because the beeper technology failed during --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then you're --
you're moving away from your argument. Your argument is
it doesn't depend how much suspicion you have; it
doesn't depend on how urgent it is. Your argument is
you can do it, period. You don't have to give any
reason. It doesn't have to be limited in any way,
right?
MR. DREEBEN: That is correct, Mr. Chief
Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't the
normal way in these situations that we draw these limits
how intrusive the search can be, how long it can be, is
by having a magistrate spell it out in a warrant?
MR. DREEBEN: When you're talking about the
movements of a car on a public roadway, which even
Justice Breyer's question seems to concede could be
monitored for a day or perhaps 4 days, there is no
Fourth Amendment search, unless --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're talking
about the difference between seeing a little tile and
seeing a mosaic. The one gives you information; the
other doesn't.
MR. DREEBEN: So does a pen register. So
does a garbage pull. So does looking at everybody's
credit card statement for a month. All of those things
this Court has held are not searches. And the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, this case
started out with a warrant. There was a warrant, and
the limits weren't followed. The warrant said 10 days,
do this in 10 days, and the police took 11. They were
supposed to do it in D.C. Instead, they did it in
Maryland.
So, the police could have gotten permission
to conduct this search. In fact, they had received it.
Now, I take it that the practice had been, because it's
in the electronic surveillance manual, better get a
warrant. Was there any problem about -- when this kind
of surveillance is wanted by the government, to get a
warrant? Were they encountering difficulty getting
warrants?
MR. DREEBEN: In this case, there would not
have been any difficulty getting a warrant, Justice
Ginsburg. And the warrant authorized things beyond just
monitoring the car. It authorized entering the car in
order to install it, which wasn't necessary here. It
also authorized monitoring the car in a location where
there was a reasonable expectation of privacy. This
case is only about monitoring a car on public streets.
But I think it's very important to keep in
mind that the -- the principal use of this kind of
surveillance is when the police have not yet acquired
probable cause but have a situation that does call for
monitoring. And I'd like to give an example.
If the police get an anonymous phone call
that a bomb threat is going to be carried out at a
mosque by people who work at a small company, the bomb
threat on an anonymous call will not provide even
reasonable suspicion under this Court's decision in
Florida v. J.L.
But you can hardly expect the FBI to ignore
a credible, detailed-sounding piece of information like
that. Now, the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you get an
anonymous tip that there's the same bomb in somebody's
house, do you get a warrant or do -- do you just go in?
MR. DREEBEN: You do neither, because
without probable cause you cannot enter the house.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Well, why
are you asking for a different rule in this situation?
MR. DREEBEN: Because the -- the police in
this situation have the traditional means available to
investigate these sorts of tips. They could put teams
of agents on all the individuals who are within the pool
of suspicion and follow them 24/7. And that would
raise --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're -- you're now
suggesting an answer to Justice Kennedy's question,
which is it would be okay to take the computer chip, put
it on somebody's overcoat, and follow every citizen
everywhere they go indefinitely. So -- under your
theory and the theory espoused in your brief, you could
monitor and track every person through their cell phone,
because today the smartphones emit signals that police
can pick up and use to follow someone anywhere they go.
Your theory is so long as the -- that all --
that what is being monitored is the movement of person,
of a person, they have no reasonable expectation that
their possessions will not be used by you. That's
really the bottom line --
MR. DREEBEN: I think that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to track them, to
invade their sense of integrity in their choices about
who they want to see or use their things. That's really
argument you're making.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I
think that that goes considerably farther than our
position in this case, because our position is not that
the Court should overrule United States v. Karo and
permit monitoring within a private residence. That is
off limits absent a warrant or exigent circumstances
plus probable cause. And monitoring an individual
through their clothing poses an extremely high
likelihood that they will enter a place where they have
a reasonable expectation of privacy.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Cars get parked in a
garages. It happened here.
MR. DREEBEN: Yes, but a car that's parked
in a garage does not have a reasonable expectation of
privacy as to its location. Anyone can observe --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Neither does the person.
MR. DREEBEN: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A person goes home, and
their overcoat gets hung on a hanger. What's the
difference.
MR. DREEBEN: Once the -- once the effect is
in the house, under Karo there is an expectation of
privacy that cannot be breached without a warrant, and
we're not asking the Court to overrule that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me what the
difference between this and a general warrant is? I
mean --
MR. DREEBEN: A general warrant --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what motivated the
Fourth Amendment historically was the disapproval, the
outrage, that our Founding Fathers experienced with
general warrants that permitted police indiscriminately
to investigate just on the basis of suspicion, not
probable cause, and to invade every possession that the
individual had in search of a crime. How is this
different --
MR. DREEBEN: A warrant authorizes --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- this kind of
surveillance where there's no probable cause, there's
not even necessarily reasonable suspicion in --
MR. DREEBEN: A warrant authorizes a search.
This authorizes the ability to track somebody's
movements in a car on a public roadway, a subject as to
which this Court said in Knotts that no individual has a
reasonable expectation of privacy because when they go
out in their car, their car is traveling on public
roads. Anyone can look. The police have no obligation
to avert their eyes from anything that any member of the
public --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if we -- I give
you that, that it's in public. Does the reasonable
expectation of privacy trump that fact? In other words,
if we ask people, do you think it's -- it violates your
right to privacy to have this kind of information
acquired, and everybody says yes, is it a response that,
no, that takes place in public, or is it simply the
reasonable expectation of privacy regardless of the fact
that it takes place in public?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, something that takes
place in public isn't inherently off limits to a
reasonable expectation of privacy. That's essentially
the holding of Katz. You go into a phone booth, you're
in public; making your calls within the phone booth is
subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy.
But this Court, with full awareness of that
holding, in Knotts and in Karo recognized that
surveillance of a vehicle traveling on the public
roadways doesn't fit that description.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can see, though,
can't you, that 30 years ago if you asked people does it
violate your privacy to be followed by a beeper, the
police following you, you might get one answer, while
today if you ask people does it violate your right to
privacy to know that the police can have a record of
every movement you made in the past month, they might
see that differently?
MR. DREEBEN: They probably would also feel
differently about being followed 24/7 by a team of FBI
agents, who gain far more information than a GPS device
produces. GPS only gives you the approximate location
of the car as it drives on the roads --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the speed as well.
MR. DREEBEN: The approximate speed, the
location traveled, the -- that -- that is what the GPS
provides. It doesn't show you where the car stopped.
It doesn't show you who was driving the car. It doesn't
show you who was --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: An easy way to pick
someone up for speeding when you suspect something far
worse but have no -- no probable cause.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court held in Whren
v. United States that when the police have probable
cause to stop someone for a traffic violation, they can
do that. There are protections --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was -- that is when
the police came upon the violator. But this is -- it's
all in a computer. The police can say we want to find
out more about X, so consult the database, see if
there's an indication that he was ever speeding in the
last 28 days.
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, it's not
very hard for police to follow somebody and find a
traffic violation if they want to do that. But to
answer in part Justice Breyer's earlier concern about
limiting principles, this Court recognized in the Whren
decision that, although the Fourth Amendment is not a
restriction on discriminatory or arbitrary or oppressive
stops that are based on invidious characteristics, the
Equal Protection Clause is. The First Amendment also
stands as a protection. If this Court believes that
there is an excessive chill created by an actual law or
universal practice of monitoring people through GPS,
there are other constitutional principles that are
available.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Fourth Amendment
protects us against unreasonable searches and seizures.
And if I were trying to explain to someone, here's the
Fourth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment says -- or it has
been interpreted to mean that if I'm on a public bus and
the police want to feel my luggage, that's a violation;
and yet, this kind of monitoring, installing the GPS and
monitoring the person's movement whenever they are
outside their house in the car, is not? I mean, it just
-- something about it that -- just doesn't parse.
MR. DREEBEN: I'm quite sure, Justice
Ginsburg, that if you ask citizens whether the police
could freely pick up their trash for a month and paw
through it, looking for evidence of a crime, or keep a
record of every telephone call that they made for the
duration and the number that it went through, or conduct
intense visual surveillance of them, that citizens would
probably also find that to be, in the word that
Respondents choose to use --
JUSTICE BREYER: But they won't -- they
won't and probably couldn't physically.
Start with the other end. Start -- what
would a democratic society look like if a large number
of people did think that the government was tracking
their every movement over long periods of time. And
once you reject that, you have to have a reason under
the Fourth Amendment and a principle. And what I'm
looking for is the reason and the principle that would
reject that, but wouldn't also reject 24 hours a day for
28 days.
MR. DREEBEN: I think --
JUSTICE BREYER: Do you see where I'm -- and
that's what I'm listening very hard to find.
MR. DREEBEN: All right. Justice Breyer,
two things on that. First of all, I think the
line-drawing problems that the Court would create for
itself would be intolerable, and better that the Court
should address the so-called 1984 scenarios if they come
to pass, rather than using this case as a vehicle for
doing so.
Second, if the Court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This case is not that
vehicle.
MR. DREEBEN: If the Court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The GPS technology today
is limited only by the cost of the instrument, which
frankly right now is so small that it wouldn't take that
much of a budget, local budget, to place a GPS on every
car in the nation.
MR. DREEBEN: Oh, I think that would be --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Almost every car has it
now.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think it would be
virtually impossible to use the kinds of tracking
devices that were used in this case on everyone
because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't we have any
legislatures out there that can stop this stuff?
MR. DREEBEN: I think that -- Justice
Scalia, the legislature is a safeguard, and if the Court
believes that there needs to be a Fourth Amendment
safeguard as well, we have urged as a fallback position
that the Court adopt a reasonable suspicion standard
which would allow the police to conduct surveillance of
individuals in their movements on public roadways, which
they can do visually in any event, and would allow the
police to investigate leads and tips that arise under
circumstances where there is not probable cause.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who would be under your
test the judge of the reasonable suspicion?
MR. DREEBEN: As in most reasonable
suspicion cases, it's the police at the front end and
it's the courts at the back end if there are motions to
suppress evidence. But fundamentally, just as in the
pen register example and in the financial records
example, if this Court concludes, consistent with its
earlier cases, that this is not a search, yet all
Americans find it to be an omen of 1984, Congress would
stand ready to provide appropriate protection.
If I may save the rest of my time for
rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. Your --
our questions have eaten into your rebuttal time. So,
we'll give you the full time.
Mr. Leckar.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C. LECKAR
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LECKAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
I want to talk about the one issue that the
United States didn't talk about, which is whether this
is a seizure. This case can be resolved on a very
narrow basis, a very narrow basis: What are the
consequences when the police without a warrant install a
GPS secretly on the car of any citizen of the United
States, and they want to use the evidence gained that
way in a criminal trial? Our position is that's a
seizure.
JUSTICE ALITO: What is the size of this
device?
MR. LECKAR: I'm sorry, Your Honor?
JUSTICE ALITO: What is the size of this
device?
MR. LECKAR: In -- the record doesn't show
in this case, but we know -- we learned last week,
Justice Alito, from the NACDL that there's now a GPS on
the market that weighs 2 ounces and is the size of a
credit card. Think how easy it would be for any law
enforcement agent of the 880,000 in the United States to
stick one of those on anybody's vehicle.
JUSTICE ALITO: And what if it was put on
the license place? Would that be a technical trespass?
Is that the property of the driver?
MR. LECKAR: Well, a license plate, as I
understand it, is the property of the State, and driving
is a privilege. But it's not a technical trespass in
this particular case. Mr. Jones had the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? I don't own
my license plate? I didn't know that. How do you know
that?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you know that? I
paid for my license plate.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KENNEDY: We don't need to get into
it, but "Live Free or Die" was spelled on the license
plate.
(Laughter.)
MR. LECKAR: What I'm saying, Justice
Kennedy and Justice Scalia, is this: That the issue
insofar as the seizure is concerned is, is it
meaningful. Everybody agrees here that there is -- that
Antoine Jones had the right to control the use of his
vehicle. The question is, was the interference a
meaningful deprivation of his possessory interest?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I didn't -- I didn't
hear an answer to Justice Alito's question. What is
your position on the placement of the GPS device on the
State-owned license plate?
MR. LECKAR: They can't do it. They can't
do it, Your Honor. It's a seizure.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a --
MR. LECKAR: If -- I'm sorry. If the
installation --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My understanding is
correct that it's the State's license plate they require
you to have. So, your trespass theory, it would seem,
falls apart with respect to that particular scenario.
MR. LECKAR: Well, first of all, Justice --
Chief Justice Roberts, my -- you would probably see the
GPS, and in that case, you might have --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. It's the size
of a credit card. You slip it behind the license plate.
MR. LECKAR: In that particular case, what
you have done is you have -- the installation of the
GPS, it is a seizure. What makes it meaningful is the
use of that GPS --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is ridiculous.
Look at -- you give the State permission to put the
license plate -- to carry -- to have your car carry the
State's license plate. You do not give anybody
permission to have your car carry a tracking device.
MR. LECKAR: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And whether it's put
directly on the car or directly on something that the
car is carrying doesn't seem to me to make any
difference.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought it made a
difference under your theory, which focused on the
question of trespass, because it was attached to an
effect owned by somebody else. This is an effect not
owned by the individual.
MR. LECKAR: That's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, the trespass
theory anyway doesn't seem ridiculous to me.
MR. LECKAR: But it's an effect, Your Honor.
The Fourth Amendment protects effects. It protects
people. If you put it on somebody's briefcase, you put
it on somebody's car, you have affected their possessory
interest. Then the question becomes --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Leckar, I guess I'm not
sure I quite understand the argument, because a trespass
is accomplished no matter what you put on somebody's car
or somebody's overcoat or what have you. You could put
a nonworking device in somebody's car, and it would
still be a trespass, but surely the same constitutional
problem is not raised. So, how do you get from the
trespass to the constitutional problem?
MR. LECKAR: As I -- thank you, Justice
Kagan. As I said moments ago, what makes it meaningful,
what makes it a meaningful deprivation of a -- of a
possessory interest, is once the GPS gets activated. We
look at reality. We follow what Silverman v. --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make it a
seizure. That doesn't make it a seizure. It makes it a
search.
MR. LECKAR: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you can say that
there's a trespass for the purpose of obtaining
information, which makes it a search. But I don't see
how it's a seizure. A seizure -- you have to bring
something within your control. You have to stop the
person or stop the vehicle. What has been seized when
you -- when you slap a tracking device on a car?
MR. LECKAR: What has been seized is
Antoine's data. Data is seized that is created by the
GPS. Antoine Jones had the right, Your Honor, to
control the use of his vehicle. And what the government
did was surreptitiously deprive him of the use of
that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any case
involving seizure of data floating in the air as opposed
to papers?
MR. LECKAR: The closest case I could come,
Your Honor, would be Silverman, where the Court called a
Fourth Amendment violation where the spike mike just
touched -- touched the ventilator unit.
JUSTICE BREYER: It's not a violation
unless, in addition to a search, it is an unreasonable
search. And since you already -- and the same is true
of seizure, isn't it?
MR. LECKAR: That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER: So, you already have --
everybody agrees it's at least a search. So, what do
you care whether there's the -- and there's a case
called Karo which says whether it's a trespass doesn't
really matter. The question is the reasonableness of
it. And that's what I think -- I mean, you can argue
trespass as much as you want, but I'll still have in
mind is it reasonable.
MR. LECKAR: That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER: And I think that's the
question we've been debating. And I would like to know
from you -- what they are saying is that the parade of
horribles we can worry with -- worry about when it comes
up; the police have many, many people that they suspect
of all kinds of things ranging from kidnappings of lost
children to terrorism to all kinds of crimes.
They're willing to go as far as reasonable
suspicion in a pinch. And they say at least with that,
you will avoid the 1984 scenario, and you will in fact
allow the police to do their work with doing no more
than subjecting the person to really good knowledge of
where he's going on the open highway. Now, I -- they
probably put it better than I did, but I'd appreciate
your views on that.
MR. LECKAR: Reasonable suspicion, Justice
Breyer, is something that the Court has adopted for
limited intrusions. And I refer you to the United
States v. Place. Every 10 seconds of the day for 28
days is by no person's lights a -- a limited intrusion.
That said, what -- what happened here, society does not
view as reasonable the concept that the United States
Government has the right to take a device that enables
them to engage in pervasive, limitless, cost-free --
cost-free surveillance -- that completely replaces the
human equation --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you know
that?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why does it have to be
cost-free? Suppose the police department says: We've
got two things; we can put 30 deputies on this route and
watch this person, or we can have a device with a
warrant. What difference does it make?
MR. LECKAR: What happens is the police have
the capacity with GPS to engage in grave abuse, grave
abuse of individual and group liberties, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose what they got
is nothing more than what they would have had if they
had 30 deputies staked out along the route. That's all.
They'd get the same from 30 deputies. A constitutional
violation?
MR. LECKAR: Yes, if they use a GPS, Your
Honor. Any placement of a GPS on anybody's car or this
car --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, no. We're assuming
that there's no initial trespass, which is a problem in
this case.
MR. LECKAR: All right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying it's -- it's
the quantity and -- of the information seized and the
time over which it's seized. And that's the proposition
we're testing. And it seems to me what you're saying is
that the police have to use the most inefficient
methods.
MR. LECKAR: No, Your Honor. I'm not
asking --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm fully aware of the
1984 ministry of love, ministry of -- of peace problem.
But this -- your argument, it seems to me, has no
principled distinction from the case that I put.
MR. LECKAR: I think I can help you with
that. We're not asking to make the police less
efficient than they were before GPS came into effect.
We're simply saying that the use of GPS has grave
potential -- grave threats of abuse to privacy; that
people have an expectation, Justice Kennedy, that their
neighbor is not going to use their car to track them.
People have an -- under Rakas -- and I refer the Court
to footnote 12 in the Rakas case. Antoine Jones had
control of that car. Control of that -- of the vehicle
meant that he had a reasonable expectation that society
is prepared to view as objectively reasonable. The
government --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he -- he wouldn't be
protected against a surveillance camera that could get
information. And is this really different in kind from
the surveillance camera?
MR. LECKAR: Yes. First of all, you have a
physical invasion. That's Bond v. United States. You
have an invasion of his possessory interest, placement
on the car. Physical invasion of a possessory interest,
Justice Ginsburg, is more significant. It has always
been viewed by this Court as more invasive than mere
video -- mere visual surveillance.
And even with a camera, it depends on the
type of the video camera. We're not saying that the
police are prohibited from having individual video
cameras or several video cameras to surveil people.
What we're saying here is this device, this device that
enables limitless, pervasive, indiscriminate --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But what is the difference
really? I'm told -- maybe this is wrong, but I'm told
that if somebody goes to London, almost every place that
person goes there's a camera taking pictures, so that
the police can put together snapshots of where everybody
is all the time. So, why is this different from that?
MR. LECKAR: It's pretty scary. I wouldn't
want to live in London under those circumstances.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it must be
unconstitutional if it's scary.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what is it, the
scary provision of what article?
JUSTICE BREYER: And, in fact, those cameras
in London actually enabled them, if you watched, I got
the impression, to track the bomber who was going to
blow up the airport in Glasgow and to stop him before he
did. So, there are many people who will say that that
kind of surveillance is worthwhile, and there are others
like you who will say, no, that's a bad thing. But that
isn't the issue exactly in front of us.
MR. LECKAR: That's correct, Your Honor.
What we have here is a physical --
JUSTICE BREYER: And what Justice Kagan
wanted to know is why not.
MR. LECKAR: Because you have a physical
invasion of property.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, my goodness. Here, I I
can read -- sorry, I just had that expression because
I'm reading: "The existence of a physical trespass is
only marginally relevant to the question of whether the
Fourth Amendment has been violated, however, for an
actual trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to
establish a constitutional violation." That's Karo.
So, you can talk if you'd like. It's your
hour. But I would really be very interested in hearing
you on the assumption that the real issue here is
whether this is reasonable.
MR. LECKAR: It's not, Your Honor. This is
not a Karo case. First of all, in Karo the installation
was essentially consented to. You took -- the package
came in by virtue of somebody who was working for the
government. So, the installation was not unlike this
case -- was unlike this case, where it was surreptitious
and directly engaged in by a government agent.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're mixing -- you're
mixing two things. You're the one that -- I thought
your position was that the initial trespass is not
important. That's the narrow way to decide the issue.
You don't want us to do that. So, now we ask you about
Karo, and you say, oh, well, there was a trespass. So,
that's -- that's not -- that's not a responsive answer.
MR. LECKAR: Well, but technology, as you
observed, Justice Kennedy, is dramatically different
with GPS than was present in Karo.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's going to be
dramatically different in the next step. There are now
satellites that look down and can hone in on your home
on a block in a neighborhood. I don't see that far in
the future when those cameras are going to be able to
show you the entire world and let you track somebody on
the camera from place to place.
MR. LECKAR: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if -- give us a
theory. Is that okay for the police to access those
cameras and look at you moving from place to place? And
if that's okay, then why is this not okay? What is your
theory of your case?
MR. LECKAR: Our theory, Justice Sotomayor,
with respect to video camera, if they're targeting an
individual -- this presents a grave question. It's a
question that need not be resolved given this case. But
if the Court wanted to address that question, once the
police target somebody, they want to engage in
individualized targeting for use of a pervasive network
of cameras, and GPS is like a million cameras. That's
the -- the New York Court of Appeals pointed that out,
and this --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think there's about 28
satellites up there, but okay.
MR. LECKAR: All right. It's 28 cameras,
but the equivalent of a camera tracking you every street
corner you're on everywhere. Once you have
individualized suspicion like that, if a court wanted to
deal with it, I believe you would have to have a
warrant.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Leckar, your -- all of
this discussion -- you're going into it, but the
questioning leads you into it -- it seems to me leaps
over the difficult part of your case. The issue before
us is not -- not in the abstract whether this police
conduct is unreasonable. The unreasonableness
requirement or the unreasonableness prohibition does not
take effect unless there has been a search. And our
cases have said that there's no search when -- when you
are in public and where everything that you do is open
to -- to the view of people. That's the hard question
in the case, not whether this is unreasonable. That's
not what the Fourth Amendment says, the police can't do
anything that's unreasonable. They can do a lot of
stuff that's unreasonable without violating the Fourth
Amendment, and the -- the protection against that is the
legislature.
But you have to establish, if you're going
to go with Katz, that there has been an invasion of --
of privacy when all that -- all that this is showing is
where the car is going on the public streets, where the
police could have had round-the-clock surveillance on
this individual for a whole month or for 2 months or for
3 months, and that would not have violated anything,
would it?
MR. LECKAR: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Because there's no
invasion of privacy. So, why is this an invasion of
privacy?
MR. LECKAR: Because it is -- it is a
complete robotic substitute. It's not a -- it's not a
tail. And interestingly enough, Your Honor. The
government only cited in its brief one instance of a
24-hour surveillance for all of 2 days. What you have
here, Justice Scalia, is -- I'm going to refer to your
dissent.
JUSTICE SCALIA: A hundred times zero equals
zero. If -- if there is no invasion of privacy for 1
day, there's no invasion of privacy for a hundred days.
Now, it may be unreasonable police conduct, and we can
handle that with laws. But if there's no invasion of
privacy, no matter how many days you do it, there's no
invasion of privacy.
MR. LECKAR: Justice Scalia, what -- I'm
going to refer to your dissent along with Justice Breyer
in Bond v. United States. A GPS in your car is like --
or anybody's car, is like -- without a warrant, is like
having an -- it makes you unable to get rid of an
uninvited stranger. That's what it is. Now, what --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So is a tail. So is a tail
when the police surveil -- surveil you for -- for a
month.
MR. LECKAR: The question we have to answer
in this case, Justice Scalia, is this: A tail -- if
they can -- if they want a tail, if they want to commit
the resources, that's fine. But what a GPS does, it
involves -- it allows the government to engage in
unlimited surveillance through a machine, through a
machine robotically. Nobody is even involved monitoring
it. The record in this case showed that many times the
police officers just let -- let the machine go on.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, where would you draw
the line? Suppose that the GPS was used only to track
somebody's movements for 1 day or for 12 hours or for 3
hours. Would that be all right?
MR. LECKAR: Our position, Justice Alito, is
no circumstances should a GPS be allowed to be put on
somebody's car. But we recognize --
JUSTICE ALITO: Put aside -- put aside the
trespass question.
MR. LECKAR: I'm not addressing it purely as
a trespass.  Our view is the -- the use of a GPS as a
search in and of itself should be -- is -- should be
viewed as unreasonable. But if the Court were
uncomfortable with that, if the Court had concerns with
that, we suggested in our brief some -- some
possibilities: One day, one trip, one person per day or
trip, or perhaps when you use it exactly as a beeper,
when you follow it, when you actually physically follow
it.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that sounds like a
legislative line. But what is the difference between
following somebody for 12 hours, let's say, and
monitoring their movements on a GPS for 12 hours? You
would say that the latter -- your first argument is
there's a problem with the latter but not with the
former. But what would the reason for that be?
MR. LECKAR: Because it's an unreasonable
invasion of privacy, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO: There's no more -- what --
what is the difference in terms of one's privacy whether
you're followed by a police officer for 12 hours and you
don't see the officer or whether you're monitored by GPS
for 12 hours?
MR. LECKAR: Because -- because what you
have here is society does not expect that the police,
the human element, would be taken out of -- would be
taken out of the surveillance factor.
JUSTICE ALITO: You know, I don't know what
society expects, and I think it's changing. Technology
is changing people's expectations of privacy.
Suppose we look forward 10 years, and maybe
years from now 90 percent of the population will be
using social networking sites, and they will have on
average 500 friends, and they will have allowed their
friends to monitor their location 24 hours a day, 365
days a year, through the use of their cell phones. Then
-- what would the expectation of privacy be then?
MR. LECKAR: Well, the use of a cell phone,
there are two ways of looking at it. As Justice Kennedy
observed in Quon, cell phones are becoming so
ubiquitous, there may be privacy interests.
Our view is that currently the use of a cell
phone, that's a voluntary act. People nowadays
understand that there are ways to monitor by way of a
cell phone.
But I started my oral argument with this
basic precept, Justice Alito: This case does not
require us to decide those issues of emerging
technology. It's a simple case at the core: Should the
police be allowed surreptitiously to put these machines
on people's cars and either -- call it a seizure, call
it a search, call it a search and seizure in the words
of Katz, or call it a Fourth Amendment violation.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that -- maybe that's a
good way to decide the case. But I just wonder, would
Mr. Jones or anybody else be really upset if they found
that the police had sneaked up to their car and put an
inert device the size of a credit card on the underside
of the car? What would they say about that, other than
the fact that the police are wasting money doing this?
MR. LECKAR: If it were nothing more than a
note, say, or even a bumper sticker like you get at
South of the Border, probably nothing, but this --
JUSTICE ALITO: You don't even see it. It's
just a little wafer. They put it under the car. It
does nothing.
MR. LECKAR: It's a little wafer that's got
an enormous capacity. Look at the --
JUSTICE ALITO: No, but this one does
nothing, and you -- so you would go -- you would sue --
you would bring a trespass action.
MR. LECKAR: No, heavens, no, Your Honor.
If it did nothing, first, it wouldn't be a Fourth
Amendment problem.
JUSTICE ALITO: So, what's you're concerned
about is not this little thing that's put on your car.
It's not this invasion of your property interest. It's
the monitoring that takes place.
MR. LECKAR: The monitoring makes it
meaningful. Putting it on enables them to make --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But to ask Justice Alito's
question in a different way, suppose that the police
could do this without ever committing the trespass.
Suppose that in the future all cars are going to have
GPS tracking systems, and the police could essentially
hack into such a system without committing the trespass.
Would the constitutional issue we face be any different?
MR. LECKAR: If, as I assume, that's because
of manufacturers doing it, or because Congress has
legislated it, Justice Kagan? Under either
circumstance, people would know. They would know that
their privacy rights had been taken away. Whether that
would be possible to be -- to go through Congress, I
seriously doubt, but people would know.
In this particular case, Antoine Jones had
no idea whatsoever that his possessory interest in that
property was about to be deprived by the government in a
meaningful way to allow them to get information they
couldn't have otherwise have gotten.
Justice Alito, what happens here, GPS
produces unique data. When you and I drive down the
street, we don't emit GPS data. What makes GPS data
meaningful is the act -- is the use and placement of the
GPS device, that was in this case, in this case,
unconsented to by Antoine Jones, unknowingly. And the
government knew that. That's why they went and did it
surreptitiously, because they couldn't get it any other
way.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Lots of communities have,
including Washington, cameras on -- at intersections on
stop lights. Suppose the police suspected someone of
criminal activity, and they had a computer capacity to
take pictures of all the intersections that he drove
through at different times of day, and they checked his
movements and his routes for 5 days. Would that be
lawful?
MR. LECKAR: I think that would be
allowable, Your Honor. I don't think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think it would be?
MR. LECKAR: I think that would be
permissible, Your Honor. First of all, you don't have
an invasion of -- you don't have a physical intrusion,
unlike this case. People nowadays --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You have -- you have a
targeted invasion. It's over a period of time. It's
over a long -- it's over a wide space, and it seems to
me that -- it seems to me you have to answer my question
"yes" to be consistent with what you've said earlier.
MR. LECKAR: No, Your Honor. As I said
earlier, you can have an -- you can have an occasional
video camera out there. People understand nowadays that
there may be video cameras out in public space. The --
but we don't have any -- society does not expect -- view
it as reasonable to have the equivalent of a million
video cameras following you everywhere you go.
A few video cameras, people know. They've
cropped -- they've cropped up, and they've been
accepted. But this is a horse of an entirely different
color. This is a small device that enables the
government to get information of a vast amount of --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What an --
MR. LECKAR: The camera is one site, one --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What an unworkable rule
with no -- tethered to no principle.
MR. LECKAR: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What an unworkable rule
tethered to no principle. A thousand video cameras may
or may not be okay, depending on how large the city is?
MR. LECKAR: No, Justice Sotomayor. I think
the workable rule and the simplest rule that should be
adopted is this: I think the Court should say to the
law enforcement agency you came here looking for a rule;
we're going to give you a rule. If you want to use GPS
devices, get a warrant, absent exigent circumstances or
another recognized exception to the Fourth Amendment;
because of their capacity for -- to collect data that
you couldn't realistically get, because of the
vanishingly low cost, because of their pervasive nature,
that you should get a warrant any time -- you must get a
warrant any time you're going to attach a GPS to a
citizen's effect or to a citizen's person.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that gets back
to Justice Scalia's question, which is you've got to
determine that there has been a search first before you
impose the warrant requirement. And it seems to me that
your -- the warrant requirement applies only with
respect to searches, right?
MR. LECKAR: And seizures.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And seizures.
So, while it might seem like a good idea to impose the
requirement on this particular technological device, you
still have to establish that it's a search.
MR. LECKAR: But if you know, if you the
police agents know -- this is the deliberative process.
These devices aren't used for just quick one-off
surveillance. They're used to track people over time,
as witness this case, every 10 seconds of the day for 28
days.
If you know you're going to do that and you
know, Justice Roberts, that this device -- this device
has an amazingly invasive power and capacity. If you
know you're going to do that and you're a law
enforcement agent, then you do what they did originally.
You get a warrant.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, we pushed your
-- we pushed your friend to the limits of his theory.
Your theory, I take it, would apply if you're going to
do it for 3 minutes, right? Where's the car? You push
a button; it's 3 minutes. You say that's still a Fourth
Amendment violation?
MR. LECKAR: Yes --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, then
don't talk to me about how long they're going to be
doing it or all the information. We have to test the
validity of your theory on the proposition that it
violates the Fourth Amendment to do this for 3 minutes.
MR. LECKAR: I -- I think it does, Your
Honor, because of the -- society does not expect --
society views it as objectively reasonable not to
expect --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have said that
several times. How do we tell? I mean, I don't know
what society expects. I suppose if you ask people do
you think it's a violation of privacy for the police to
do this for no reason for a month, maybe they'd come out
one way. If you asked the people do you think the
police have to have probable cause before they monitor
for 5 minutes the movements of somebody they think is
going to set off a huge bomb, maybe you get a different
answer.
MR. LECKAR: You look to -- you look to the
common law. You look to well-established case law. You
look to statutes in several jurisdictions. I think
there are seven or eight that said this sort of practice
should be prohibited.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excellent. Yes. Of
course, a legislature can take care of this, whether or
not there is an invasion of privacy. And they can pick
5 days out of the air. You can't do it for any more
than 5 days, or you can't do it to more than -- than 50
people at a time. They can take care of all of that
stuff.
We can't do that in a decision under the --
under the Fourth Amendment.
MR. LECKAR: We have --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't this precisely
the kind of a problem that you should rely upon
legislatures to take care of?
MR. LECKAR: That's the same -- that's the
same -- same problem that the United States advanced
before this Court in the United States v. District
Court; give it to Congress. And what this Court there
did, it held a Fourth Amendment violation so far as
domestic security is concerned and gave Congress
suggestions. In this particular case, I could probably
give you 535 reasons why not to go to Congress --
(Laughter.)
MR. LECKAR: -- but let me suggest
something, Justice Scalia. What happened was the United
States has adopted a shifting position. They came to
this Court, and they said we want a workable rule; give
us a workable rule. You either overrule the D.C.
Circuit, which you should not do, or give us a workable
rule. Now they've said in their brief, oh, let's take
it to the legislature. They can't have it both ways.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can you take it to Congress
the other way? I mean, can you say that a general
search of this kind is not constitutional under the
Fourth Amendment, but should Congress pick out a subset
thereof, say, the -- terrorism or where there is
reasonable cause or like the FISA court or special
courts to issue special kinds of warrants, that that's a
different question which we could decide at a later
time?
That's a negative way of -- I mean, that way
favors you in the result, but I've -- I've been looking
for -- if there is a way of going to Congress to create
the situations where they can do it, rather than the
situations where they can't.
MR. LECKAR: Justice Breyer, that was
exactly what Congress -- what happened when the foreign
intelligence surveillance courts were created. You hit
it right on the nail. All this Court has to do is
decide the narrow question before it, which I've
articulated several times.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see why it's any of
Congress's business if it's a -- if it's a purely
intrastate operation. Congress can control police
practices that don't violate the Fourth Amendment
throughout the country? I mean, maybe interstate,
interstate beepers and interstate tracking devices, yes,
but so long as you track within -- within the State
isn't that okay?
MR. LECKAR: No, Your Honor. First of all,
let me refer to Chief -- to Justice Frankfurter's
comments a long time ago in Watts v. Indiana: Justices
are not ignorant of the law, of what they know to be
true as men and women.
But other legislatures would follow
Congress. But what we have here -- what we have here is
a live case of controversy in which Antoine Jones'
control of his vehicle was usurped and his car was
converted into an electronic GPS transceiver serving the
government.
So, that case is here, and it -- it needs to
be decided. One doesn't need to address technologies
that aren't here before the Court today. You could; we
could venture down that road. We could discuss drone
surveillance. We could discuss balloon surveillance and
other types of surveillance. But we don't have to.
It's a narrow --
JUSTICE ALITO: There was a warrant -- there
was a warrant in this case. This is a puzzling aspect
of the case to me, and maybe there -- it's irrelevant
for present purposes. There was a warrant, and the two
violations are violations of a statute and a rule,
neither of which may carry an exclusionary rule sanction
with them or an exclusionary rule penalty with them.
It's not clear at all that there was a
violation of the Fourth Amendment. So, it's a little
strange that we're deciding whether a warrantless search
here would have been unconstitutional, when there was a
warrant.
MR. LECKAR: They had the choice. They
could have easily -- they could have gone back to the
district judge and said -- given the district judge
reasons --
JUSTICE ALITO: No, that's not my point.
The point is that the violation of the 10-day rule and
the violation of the statutory prohibition on -- or
maybe it's in the rule -- the prohibition on the judge
in the District ordering the installation only in the
District are not Fourth Amendment requirements.
MR. LECKAR: No. That's correct, Your
Honor, but what we have -- what we have here is a
warrantless intrusion. When -- when the warrant --
JUSTICE ALITO: It is not a warrantless
intrusion; there was a warrant.
MR. LECKAR: But the warrant was not in
effect. At the -- at the time the -- the GPS was
placed, Justice Alito, there was no warrant. There's a
case this Court decided in the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think that's conceded
by both sides, and that's accepted by both sides. The
warrant expired. There was no warrant. The government
certainly could have gone back and said, judge, we
didn't make it; we need a little more time; give us 10
more days.
MR. LECKAR: They could -- they could
conceivably have gone back there and explained to the
district judge why they couldn't have installed it in
that period of time. The --
JUSTICE ALITO: I think if you look at the
lower court case law, you will find that a violation of
the 10-day rule is not necessarily a violation of the
Fourth Amendment. And --
MR. LECKAR: I understand that.
JUSTICE ALITO: -- it doesn't vitiate the
warrant. The warrant doesn't necessarily dissolve or
evaporate when the 10 days expire.
MR. LECKAR: Your --
JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe those cases are wrong.
MR. LECKAR: There's a 1920 Supreme Court
decision decided during the Prohibition era that
specifically said that when a warrant expires, there is
no warrant. When the 10-day rule in that case had
expired, there's no warrant. We have a warrantless
intrusion here. The government didn't have to do a
warrantless intrusion. I ask --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. LECKAR: -- the Court to affirm.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben, 5
minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, advancing
technology cuts in two directions. Technological
advances can make the police more efficient at what they
do through some of the examples that were discussed
today: Cameras, airplanes, beepers, GPS. At the same
time, technology and how it's used can change our
expectations of privacy in the ways that Justice Alito
was alluding to. Today perhaps GPS can be portrayed as
a 1984-type invasion, but as people use GPS in their
lives and for other purposes, our expectations of
privacy surrounding our location may also change. For
that --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dreeben, that -- that
seems too much to me. I mean, if you think about this,
and you think about a little robotic device following
you around 24 hours a day anyplace you go that's not
your home, reporting in all your movements to the
police, to investigative authorities, the notion that we
don't have an expectation of privacy in that, the notion
that we don't think that our privacy interests would be
violated by this robotic device, I'm -- I'm not sure how
one can say that.
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Kagan, I think the
Court should decide that case when it comes to it. This
was my fundamental point: This case does not involve
universal surveillance of every member of this Court or
every member of the society. It involves limited
surveillance of somebody who was suspected of drug
activity --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You probably haven't had
the opportunity to go into the cases. A hypothetical.
Suppose exactly these facts, only the police aren't
involved. A neighbor does it to another neighbor in
order to see where that neighbor is going, and when he
finds out, he tells his wife and other neighbors. Do
you think that in most States, that would be an invasion
of privacy?
MR. DREEBEN: I'm willing to assume that it
might be, Justice Kennedy, but I don't think that this
Court measures the metes and bounds of the Fourth
Amendment by State law invasions of privacy. The Court
has --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: We measure it by
expectations of privacy under the Katz test if -- that
may or may not be controlling.
MR. DREEBEN: Yes, but in Greenwood, the
Court dealt with a case where California had outlawed
taking somebody's garbage, and this Court said that did
not define an expectation of privacy for purposes of the
Fourth Amendment --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It found that there was no
expectation of privacy.
MR. DREEBEN: Correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I am asking you about this
case, whether there would be an expectation of
privacy --
MR. DREEBEN: Oh --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as a general matter
under tort law.
MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think so. And --
and the fact that something may be a tort for a private
person doesn't mean that it's a problem for the police
to do it. For example, in the Dow Chemical case, where
the police used -- EPA in that case actually used
cameras to surveil an industrial plant. There was a
claim that it would have violated trade secret law for
anybody else to do that. And the Court accepted that
and said tort law doesn't define the boundaries of the
Fourth Amendment.
In Knotts, the Court was very careful to
reserve the possibility of 24-hour surveillance of every
citizen in their persons and in their residences, saying
we haven't seen that kind of abuse. If that kind of
abuse comes up, the legislature is the best-equipped to
deal with it, if in fact our society regards that as an
unreasonable restriction on --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea of
how many GPS devices are being used by Federal
Government agencies and State law enforcement officials?
MR. DREEBEN: The Federal Government I can
speak to, and it's in the low thousands annually. It's
not a massive universal use of an investigative
technique. The FBI requires that there be some
reasonable basis for using GPS before it installs it.
And as a result, this is a technique that basically
supplements visual surveillance rather than supplanting
it all together.
There was visual surveillance that was
directed at Respondent. The GPS allowed it to be more
effective. As Justice Kennedy and, I think, Justice
Scalia's hypotheticals illustrated, Respondent is
essentially conceding that around-the-clock visual
surveillance through teams of agents would not have
invaded any expectation of privacy.
This Court said in Knotts that police
efficiency has never been equated with police
unconstitutionality. The fact that GPS makes it more
efficient for the police to put a tail on somebody
invades no additional expectation of privacy that they
otherwise would have had. The technology doesn't make
something private that was previously public. When we
go out in our cars, our cars have driver's licenses that
we carry. We have license plates on the car. These are
for the purpose of identification --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't seriously
argue that there isn't a possessory interest in who puts
something on your car and who -- like a -- a sign of
some sort.
MR. DREEBEN: Oh, I think there would
probably be some sort of State law possessory interest
-- Mr. Chief Justice, may I finish? But there is no
seizure for the very reason that Justice Breyer
described under the Katz case. This Court has said that
trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to create a
Fourth Amendment violation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Dreeben, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon at 11:10 a.m., the case in the
