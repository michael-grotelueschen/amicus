JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now -- we'll now hear
argument in Rhines against Weber.
Mr. Lange. You may proceed, Mr. Lange.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTO A. LANGE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LANGE: Justice Stevens, and may it please
the Court:
Stay and abeyance is the proper way to
administer the total exhaustion rule under the unique
facts of this case. Several Justices of this Court
already have endorsed stay and abeyance, and seven of the
eight circuit courts of appeals that have considered the
issue have permitted stay and abeyance under similar
circumstances.
Section 2254 and the decisions of this Court in
Granberry v. Greer and Strickland v. Washington make clear
that exhaustion is not a jurisdictional requirement.
District courts have the inherent authority and the broad
discretion to issue stays in cases that are within their
jurisdiction.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's unquestionable.
The -- the issue really is whether it's an abuse of that
discretion to -- to grant a stay and abeyance when the --
the petitioner comes before the court for habeas without
having exhausted in State court. I mean, that's the
question. I think everybody will stipulate that there's
power to -- to stay proceedings, but is it an abuse of
discretion to do so in these circumstances given the
statute that -- that wants a 1-year, prompt resort to the
Federal courts.
MR. LANGE: Justice Scalia, I agree with your
framing of the issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.
MR. LANGE: And I also believe that a stay under
these circumstances is appropriate under the statutes,
section 2254 and 2244, and is consistent with those
statutes. There is nothing, as Justice Souter noted in
his concurrence in Duncan v. Walker, that prohibits the --
the granting of a stay under circumstances such as these.
Indeed --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there's no -- there's no
abuse of discretion here. Why? Because we have an
interest in having all of the claims exhausted? If -- if
it's no more -- if it's as broad as that, then there's no
AEDPA statute of limitations.
MR. LANGE: No, Your Honor. I believe there is
no abuse of the discretion here because if a stay had
not --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, why shouldn't -- why
shouldn't the petitioner for habeas have to first go to
the State court and exhaust the State court claims? Here
that wasn't done. The petitioner eventually ended up in
Federal court with a laundry list of 30-some unexhausted
State claims, for goodness sakes. Why shouldn't those
have been presented in the first instance to the State
court?
MR. LANGE: Well, in an ideal world, they would
be presented in the first instance, but we're dealing with
a -- a world where 93 percent of petitioners are
proceeding pro se. Your Honor, stay and abeyance does
force a petitioner to present unexhausted claims in State
court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: At the price of suspending the
-year statute of limitations that Congress thought was
central to AEDPA.
MR. LANGE: No, Your Honor. I do not see this
as a suspension of the statute of limitations. Mr. Rhines
met the AEDPA statute of limitations. He filed when only,
by the State's own admission, 8 to 14 days had run on his
-year AEDPA statute of limitations.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it's a free ride if
you say -- so long as you get in within the 1-year period,
the court can then give you another 3 years or as long as
the court thinks is reasonable for you to go back and --
and do what you were supposed to do before you arrived. I
mean, that seems to me is a frustration of the 1-year
statute of limitations.
MR. LANGE: I disagree that that is a free ride,
and I do not see that as a frustration of the 1-year
statute of limitations when a petitioner has met the
-year statute of limitations.
Your Honor --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the petitioner --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the point --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- didn't go to the State
court with this enormous laundry list of unexhausted
claims. I mean, what do we do to encourage the procedure
to be followed? Congress did want all this compressed and
thought people should apply first to State court and, when
those are exhausted, then within the time limit apply to
Federal court. But this -- this scheme does something
else, it seems to me.
MR. LANGE: Your Honor, Congress wanted to
compress certainly the time between exhaustion of the
State remedies and the time when the petitioner came to
Federal court. However, Congress gave unlimited tolling
while there is any proceeding going in -- in State court.
I -- I see this stay and abeyance as a procedure that gets
applied somewhat infrequently and at the discretion of a
judge to -- a district court judge to apply or not apply
when it's appropriate to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a difference --
would you say there's a difference between a case where
the petitioner comes into Federal court in the first
instance with this laundry list or as, if I recall
correctly, this case, goes first to the State court and
then, when it's dismissed from the State court, comes to
Federal court with the same basic list which has been
exhausted, plus others which have not? Would you
distinguish the case on the propriety of stay and abeyance
of passing up the State court, going to Federal court
first, going to State court with your pro se petition
raising a bunch of claims but not all of them, and then
coming to Federal court?
MR. LANGE: I think it truly depends on the
circumstances which of those two hypotheticals present a
more compelling case for stay and abeyance. In Mr. Rhines
situation, he did go to State court first and exhausted
the vast majority of the 35 separate claims that he has
raised.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many -- how many were not
exhausted of that -- that laundry list?
MR. LANGE: The court -- or the State challenged
of the claims as unexhausted. The district court found
eight of those claims to be unexhausted, Your Honor, and
made that finding after Mr. Rhines' 1-year AEDPA period
had run. The finding -- Mr. Rhines had filed in February
of 2000 pro se. The district court's conclusion that he
had a mixed petition and that there were eight unexhausted
claims was made in July of 2002.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: 16 months.
MR. LANGE: It's actually a little bit -- it's
longer than 16 months, Your Honor. The district court
referred to 16 months, but it's almost 2 and a half years,
from February of 2000 to July of 2002, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: One of the problems is that
the statute encourages prompt resolution in -- in the
Federal system as well, and under a stay and abey
procedure, you could have a district judge who lets the
matter sit for 9-10 months and all of a sudden issues a
stay and abey. How are we going to control that?
MR. LANGE: Your Honor, I think the alternative
that the State proposes presents an even more troubling
illustration. A district court, of course, can proceed at
its own -- at its own rate, grant a stay, grant the terms
of the stay as it sees fit, and I believe that takes care
of the consideration that -- that Your Honor's question
indicated, Justice Kennedy.
The suggestion of the State sets up a situation
where, according to the State, they want Rhines to purge
his -- his claim -- his petition of the unexhausted claims
and proceed in State court at the same time, which is
unseemly to have Mr. Rhines proceeding on 27 exhausted
claims in Federal court at the same time that he is
proceeding on 8 claims in State court.
Now, South Dakota is a little bit unique. It --
it allows a second State habeas action. There's no time
bar to a second State habeas action. In fact, the South
Dakota legislature has made a policy decision that
indigent prisoners are entitled to representation of
counsel in their first habeas.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so then he's protected
in the State system, and if he needs Federal review, he
can come here on direct.
MR. LANGE: Your Honor, the problem is the eight
claims that he is now exhausting in State court, if the
State's approach is taken, he forever sacrifices, loses
the right to Federal review of those eight claims.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. He can come to -- here --
this Court on direct review.
MR. LANGE: Excuse me. Under direct review?
Is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: He can come to this Court on
certiorari after the State decision in the second -- in
the second habeas.
MR. LANGE: Your Honor, as a matter of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's fair for you to say he
loses his right to Federal review --
MR. LANGE: Right. Your --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because we wouldn't
necessarily take that case, whereas you say he'd have a
right to go into Federal -- Federal habeas. So --
MR. LANGE: Thank you for throwing me the life
preserver. I --
(Laughter.)
MR. LANGE: I understand this Court grants fewer
than 1 percent of the cases, so as a practical matter, for
there to be an independent review, as contemplated by
section 2254(a), it does require a district court's
involvement. As a practical matter, this Court on -- on
cert can't be expected to -- to conduct that review.
54(a), which is the statute that grants
jurisdiction, does indicate that a Federal court shall
entertain causes of this action. Now, 2254(b) does
contain the exhaustion requirement in (b)(1) and makes
clear in (b)(2) and (b)(3) that it is not jurisdictional.
The -- the irony --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would we have to -- would we
have to reverse in part Rose against Lundy to go with your
view?
MR. LANGE: I don't believe so anymore than you
would have to reverse in part Rose v. Lundy to go with the
State's view. And let me explain.
The approach of stay and abeyance is more
consistent with the principles of Rose v. Lundy than the
-- than the State's position. In Rose, this Court was
concerned about comity and federalism. It -- it serves
the interests of comity and federalism for a Federal court
to suspend consideration of a Federal habeas case while a
petitioner has a remedy and is actually pursuing it in
State court. The petitioner may be granted the remedy in
State court, which in turn would render the Federal
petition moot altogether. There could be, between the
competing State and Federal cases, competition for the
transcript or even the exhibits.
Rose v. Lundy also contemplated a process that
would not unreasonably impair the petitioner's right and
would give the petitioner the choice of either purging the
unexhausted claims or going back to State court,
exhausting the claims, and then coming back to Federal
court with one fully exhausted --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that was at a time
before the AEDPA enactment that tried to put limits, time
limits, on these things.
MR. LANGE: The only --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That's what we run into here,
is a total frustration almost of Congress' time limiting.
MR. LANGE: Your Honor, I -- I would disagree
that this is a total frustration of Congress' time
limiting -- time limiting. Again, Congress granted
unlimited tolling while a petitioner is pursuing remedies
in State court. Congress was not attempting to frustrate
or impede the petitioner's right to seek State court
relief or --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but Congress, I think
under this scheme, envisioned having someone make all the
State claims the first time around, gather them up and go
to State court, and let them take as long as they like --
no statute will run until that's complete -- and then go
to the Federal court. And this does an end run around
that approach.
MR. LANGE: Your Honor, I don't believe this
does an end run because this is different than -- than
tolling. First of all, in tolling it's automatic under a
statute, and stay and abeyance is always discretionary
with the court. The court can grant or deny the stay and
abeyance order, alter it, revoke it, or in this case, put
time limits on the petitioner's right to go back and --
and forth.
Also, Mr. Rhines has complied with the AEDPA
period. He did file.
The unusual situation that could result here is
if you assume a prisoner B who's in Rhines' same position
and files at the same time, when only approximately 9 days
have elapsed on his AEDPA period. Petitioner B, let's
assume, files three claims: one exhausted, one
unexhausted, and one there's a dispute over whether it's
exhausted or not. Because petitioner B had a short trial
perhaps or draws a different judge in the District of
South Dakota, the judge can rule on that case perhaps
within 100 days. It gives petitioner B, under my
scenario, 256 days to go to State court, exhaust his
claims, and then come back into Federal court with one
fully exhausted petition.
Rhines would be in the position of prisoner B in
my scenario but for the fact that his claims are -- are
much more complicated. He is serving a -- a sentence of
death. He did have a long trial. And under that
situation, it's simply unfair to someone in Rhines' place
to have his right to a review of the eight unexhausted
claims cut short because he had a complicated case or the
district court was slow in getting to a decision.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that happens often with
time limits. I mean, it depends on when the court
finishes its job and so forth.
What do you do about -- about our opinion in --
in Duncan v. Walker where we refused to toll the
limitation period during the pendency of a -- of the
Federal proceeding and -- and said, in -- in justification
of that holding, by tolling the limitation period for the
pursuit of State remedies and not during the pendency of
applications for Federal review, 2244 provides a powerful
incentive for litigants to exhaust all available State
remedies before proceeding in the lower Federal courts?
You are now urging us to eliminate that incentive
entirely.
MR. LANGE: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?
MR. LANGE: I believe there's always a very
powerful incentive to prisoners to exhaust in full because
if they file a mixed petition, they're not going to have
relief.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Sometimes --
MR. LANGE: (b)(1) says it shall not be granted.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you said -- you said in
your brief that -- that it's always in the -- with the
possible exception of capital cases, it's always in the
interest of a habeas applicant to get -- get it decided as
soon as possible. That's not really true. Sometimes it's
-- it's in his interest to delay it as much as possible.
Witnesses will die. People will move away. All sorts of
-- there are all sorts of reasons why he -- he might want
to delay the process.
MR. LANGE: I think those illustrations are --
are the -- very much the exception rather than the rule,
as this Court recognized in --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the
exceptional case? I mean, how do we avoid the exceptional
case?
MR. LANGE: Well, I think that's then the
district court's task that has more familiarity with the
particular case.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Which can do what?
MR. LANGE: The district court can refuse to
issue a stay and abeyance order. It can put tight
deadlines on a stay and abeyance order. The district
court can revoke a stay and abeyance order. It can alter
it if there is delay. I believe that is a decision that
should be left to the court that's closest to the facts,
the district court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think the procedure
should be any different between capital cases and
noncapital cases? We're basically talking about what
would be an abuse of discretion, as you indicated at the
outset. Do you think the same rule should apply to both,
or do you think there might be -- because there is a
greater incentive to delay in the capital case than there
is in the noncapital case.
MR. LANGE: You're right, Justice Stevens. I --
it's difficult to develop a rule that distinguishes
between the two classes, but I do believe that's in the
realm of the discretion of the district court. The
district court can set very tight deadlines on a
petitioner returning to State court to exhaust remaining
remedies like the Court here set a deadline of 60 days,
and in the circuit courts, more commonly the deadline is
days to go back to State court and then 30 days to
return once the State proceeding is -- is completed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you don't really
think we can hold that line, giving less favorable
treatment to somebody who's -- who's trying to argue
against a capital penalty, less favorable treatment to him
than somebody who's -- who just wants to avoid 10 years in
jail? That's just not going to work.
MR. LANGE: I'm not advocating less favorable
treatment or more favorable treatment for that matter. I
believe the rule has to be consistent between the two.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you just replay the
order of the proceedings? The first petition is to the
State court. Was the defendant in that first State habeas
represented by counsel?
MR. LANGE: Yes, he was, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So he's been represented by
counsel throughout.
MR. LANGE: Well, he filed his Federal habeas
petition pro se. The counsel was appointed shortly
afterwards, yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the State
application that preceded that -- he was represented
there.
MR. LANGE: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then he lost his
representation when he came to the Federal court?
MR. LANGE: Justice Ginsburg, a different lawyer
gets appointed in the Federal court system than
represented him in the -- in the State court system.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How -- how general is -- is
this problem? And -- and to what extent is it tied to the
fact that you can bring a second habeas in South Dakota?
I mean, in -- in most States, if this had happened, I
presume, when you went back to the State court, the State
court would say, you know, you didn't -- you didn't put in
these claims the last time around and they're procedurally
barred. Isn't that what would happen in -- in most other
States?
MR. LANGE: I think that's an excellent point
and on footnotes 9 and 10 of the yellow brief, there is a
litany of the State procedural rules, and many States
would bar a second habeas or would put a strict time limit
that the petitioner could not meet. South Dakota is
different in that regard.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MR. LANGE: South Dakota allows a second habeas
and, indeed, allows a petitioner in a second habeas to
show cause for a default by proving that he received
ineffective assistance of habeas counsel, which is unique
among the States.
Yes, many States that don't allow a second
remedy would -- would not -- we would not be in this
situation that we are here. However, South Dakota does.
And in fairness to Mr. Rhines, it makes sense to stay the
Federal petition and to allow him to exhaust his State
court remedies on satisfaction of Rose and to come back
with a fully exhausted claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless what would happen in
these other States as the -- is that the court would grant
the -- the stay of proceedings in order to let him go back
to the State court and be told after however long it takes
that -- that his -- his claims are now procedurally
barred. Do you think the Federal court would simply make
its own determination that the claims would be rejected by
the State court and therefore it would not stay? I don't
know.
MR. LANGE: I -- I believe that would -- could
be and -- and should be a factor in a district court's
consideration of whether to grant stay and abeyance, Your
Honor.
The State has expressed concerns about delay.
There are four reasons why those concerns are overstated.
First, in the 3 and a half years since Duncan v.
Walker was decided, there have been cases in circuit
courts of appeals that have approved of the stay and
abeyance procedure. None of those cases evidence that it
is being misused or is causing undue delay.
Second, the terms of the stay themselves can
restrict a petitioner's delay, as I've already recounted
the -- the district court did here.
Third, this Court in Slack v. McDaniel addressed
very similar arguments to what the State is making now
about delay through a second habeas filing. And this --
this Court noted that the Rules of Civil Procedure vest
courts with flexibility to prevent vexatious or delayed
litigation and that there are other reasons why those
concerns expressed in Slack v. McDaniel were -- were
overwrought.
Fourth and finally, on the prospect of delay, as
already mentioned in answer to one of Justice Scalia's
questions, the vast majority of petitioners are not under
a capital sentence. It is not hyperbole to say that 99.4
percent of Federal section 2254 habeas petitioners are not
serving -- are not under a capital penalty. Those are
statistics from the year 2000 from the Department of
Justice. And those, I think with the extremely rare
exception, are people who believe rightly or wrongly that
they're in prison because their constitutional rights have
been violated and would not favor delay under any
circumstance. So the delay concern that the State raises
is -- is overwrought.
Unless there are other questions, I'd reserve my
remaining time for rebuttal.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Lang.
General Long, we'll hear from you, please.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE E. LONG
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LONG: Justice Stevens, and may it please
the Court:
Congress -- excuse me. Congress carefully
crafted a scheme designed to encourage State prisoners
first to exhaust all of their State post-conviction
remedies and then to file their habeas corpus petitions as
soon as possible. The congressional design includes three
mutually dependent statutes, including a 1-year statute of
limitations, a tolling provision, and a total exhaustion
requirement, the combined effect of which is supposed to
reduce delay, serve the principles of comity, finality,
and federalism.
However, stay and abeyance erodes each side of
this triangular statutory design. Stay and abeyance
allows tolling in Federal court when Duncan said there
should be none. It extends the statute of limitations
beyond 1 year, and it ignores the total exhaustion
requirement of 2254(b). The result is that State
prisoners, especially capital prisoners, are encouraged to
file mixed petitions and rewarded with delay if they do
JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what is your answer to
-- to your -- your brother's answer on this, and -- and
that is, that the -- the existence of stay and abey as a
possibility is not a right to stay and abey? And -- and
if a district judge finds that a -- there is reason to
believe that the defendant is gaming the system, because
he's a capital defendant and wants to delay or wants delay
for any other reason, there's -- there's no requirement
that -- that there be a stay and -- and abeyance order.
And why -- why doesn't that take care of what I -- I think
is a very legitimate issue that you raise? Why isn't that
a -- a sufficient answer to it?
MR. LONG: I think that -- I think that the --
the answer is that Congress designed the system to resolve
all those issues in State court first. I think one of the
things that needs to be kept in mind is that an
unexhausted claim is, by its very nature and by
definition, a claim where there's an available remedy in
State court.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, again, there's no question
about that. And -- and in a perfect -- sort of in a
perfect system, I think your objection would be
unanswerable.
The trouble with the system we've got is -- is
the trouble that -- that is -- is undisputed here, and
that is, that most of these petitions, the overwhelming
number of them, are going to be pro se petitions.
Exhaustion can -- can be tricky. The -- the statute of
limitations is -- is going to run and -- and an individual
can end up in the -- in the situation that this one had.
What -- what he's asking for, in effect, is how
do we tinker with the system, in effect, to prevent its
being a -- a very unfair burden on people who don't have
the sophistication to help themselves.
MR. LONG: I don't think the system needs to be
tinkered with, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- I know but there's
-- what -- what is your answer on the merits to the fact
that most of the people who are going to ask for stay and
abey are -- are going to be pro ses, or at least have
gotten into the mess that they're in as a result of pro se
representation, and -- and that -- that exhaustion in
close cases can be a very -- very tricky issue? What --
what's your response to that?
MR. LONG: My response is in two parts. First
of all, Your Honor, I agree with you that exhaustion can
be a tricky issue, but it's -- it's the most tricky in the
question about whether or not the question has been fairly
presented. The less tricky portion of the question is
whether or not the claim is unexhausted, having been --
that means there's an available remedy in State court.
The easy way to sort that out is just to file your claim
in State court. If there is in fact an available remedy,
then you get tolling, and that solves the problem. I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure -- I'm not sure
it's -- it's true, are you, that -- that the reason people
get into these situations is because they were pro se.
That wasn't the case here. I -- I think they probably get
into this situation very often because they have a better
or at least a different lawyer at the Federal habeas stage
than they had at the State habeas stage, and this new
lawyer sees additional claims that -- that he wants to
make. Isn't -- isn't that exactly what happened here?
MR. LONG: That's -- I -- I suspect that's the
typical case in -- in capital cases. Mr. Rhines is
currently --
JUSTICE BREYER: It's typical. I mean, what I
have in the statistics is that about 36 percent of all the
habeases are dismissed for failure to exhaust, and 93
percent of all of the habeas petitioners are pro se. Now,
the conclusions I draw for that is it's probably these pro
se people -- I mean, 93 percent are pro se -- that will get
the procedural dismissals, and certainly a third or so, if
we agree with you, of all of the habeas petitions filed
in -- in Federal court are going to be finished,
terminated. The door is closed because it takes a Federal
court about nine months on average to process a habeas.
Now, you just take that and you say, we've
closed the door of the Federal court to a third of all the
habeas petitioners. And if I had thought that Congress
wanted that, then I might say fine.
But I thought that Duncan -- and I know I was on
the other side of the case, but I felt the majority had a
pretty good point on the language, to tell you the truth.
But what I didn't think they had such a -- I mean, I
couldn't find much of a congressional purpose one way or
the other there. I thought the purpose of the statute of
limitations is really to get people to file their
petitions. Once they file them, they have a year but it's
tolled. You know, I mean, you understand the thing.
I -- I'm really looking for you to tell me some
tremendously strong congressional purpose that's served so
strong that you want to knock a third of the petitioners
out of Federal court forever.
MR. LONG: I think it's less complicated than
that, Your Honor. I think that it --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's pretty simple.
MR. LONG: I --
JUSTICE BREYER: The door is closed forever. I
mean --
MR. LONG: I disagree. I disagree with you,
Justice Breyer. I -- I think that even for a pro se
petitioner, I do not think it is more difficult for him to
find the door of the State courthouse than it is to find
the door of the Federal courthouse. And the key, I think,
to your argument is that claims are unexhausted by
definition if there's an available State court remedy.
Therefore, by definition, they ought to be going to the
State courthouse rather than the Federal courthouse.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The --
JUSTICE BREYER: They seem to have made a
mistake here quite a lot. Why do these statistics come
out the way they do? I mean, it is just as easy.
MR. LONG: I -- I can't --
JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you. Why -- why
aren't they filing -- why -- why are they all filing so
many, 36 percent filing in the wrong court? Why is that?
JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, it -- it could be, I
suppose, that these people have nothing else to do sitting
around in the jailhouse, and -- and having written their
State petition, they sit around for a few more months and
they say, you know, there are a few more claims I could
make. I think that's -- it's as simply as that.
And -- and what the statute is designed to do, I
-- I think you're telling us, is to say, look it, be
careful. Make all your claims in the State court the
first time. That doesn't seem to me to be too much to
demand.
MR. LONG: Justice Scalia, I think that's
exactly what the statute -- the statutes -- the three read
together and enforced together --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they're all --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it -- I take it that
one of the answers to the observation that the Federal
court is closed to a third of the claims is that that's
not true with respect to the exhausted claims. The -- the
petition can simply be purged as to unexhausted claims and
as to the exhausted claims, the courthouse door remains
open.
MR. LONG: Well, I agree with that. The --
let's -- let's deal with the facts in this case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you --
MR. LONG: Please.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- with respect to this case?
I thought this case was such a good illustration of the
problem. If claims came into the Federal court neatly
labeled, exhausted, unexhausted, then I think that you
would have a very strong argument. But as this case
illustrates, the question of whether it's been exhausted
or not is something on which people can disagree. And I
suppose why the district court took well over a year to
decide this case is the petitioner says, I've exhausted
everything, and the prosecutor says, you have not
exhausted 12. And the district court is going by the --
going over these one by one and says in the end, you're
both wrong. My list is eight. And it's that problem of
has this claim been exhausted.
Now, if it was a case of deliberately
withholding a case from State court and bringing it up
fresh in -- in the Federal court, that would be a case
where the Federal court should say, go away, you didn't
even try. But what do you do with these cases where it's
really hard to tell whether the claim has been exhausted?
MR. LONG: That was not the situation in this
case, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did the -- the
district judge says four on the State's list have been
exhausted?
MR. LONG: Well, the -- factually the court --
the court examined the amended petition and concluded that
eight claims in the amended petition were unexhausted.
The problem is this -- or -- or at least the variance in
the facts from what you suggest is this. Mr. Rhines filed
an amended petition in November of 2000 with counsel,
after having been through all the record. He admitted in
his amended petition that four of the claims were
unexhausted. He still had 80 days left to run on the
statute of limitations. So he conceded in his amended
petition in Federal court that he still had 80 days to run
-- while there was still 80 days to run on the statute of
limitation, that four of the claims he submitted in the
petition were unexhausted. That's not difficult to sort
out because defense counsel admitted it, as he pled them.
And so there isn't tricky question about whether there
were unexhausted claims in this petition.
Now, that was in November of 2000. He waited
until the court decided the decision in July of 2002 and
didn't pursue his State court remedies until the court
ordered him to do that in July of 2002. And he filed his
State habeas to exhaust those admittedly unexhausted
claims.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that -- that would take
care of the four claims. How about the other four?
MR. LONG: Well, it doesn't make any difference
at that point, Your Honor. If there's a single, solitary
unexhausted claim, the problem --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they --
MR. LONG: -- is not -- is not worse if there
gets to be 12 or 15.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those could be -- those
could be dropped out of the Federal complaint. There
you're saying, district judge, you would be abusing your
discretion because admitting that he hadn't exhausted
these, he should have gone immediately to do that.
But what about the other four?
MR. LONG: Well, if he -- if he goes within the
days and immediately files to pursue in State court his
unexhausted claims, the statute is tolled. He doesn't
lose the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Even without going back to the
State court, I don't see anything in this statute which
indicates that Congress expected everybody who comes into
Federal court with unexhausted claims to have time to
remedy that defect by running back to State court and --
and filing. This statute doesn't give any such
indication.
And it's clear that will never happen if he
files on the 364th day after the conclusion of the State
proceedings. Right? I mean, his year is up already.
Even if the judge decides the question the next morning,
it's too late.
So I -- I don't know why we have to be concerned
about giving him some entitled second chance to go back to
-- to State court. I don't see anything in the statute
that -- that guarantees or that even envisions that. And
I -- I --
MR. LONG: I'm sorry, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: But I don't agree with that you
were saying or you do agree with that, I know.
The -- but the -- the question that I would have
is, is there anything the other way? I mean, in Duncan,
you know, I was dissenting and the thing that sort of
moved me is I couldn't imagine Congress really cared about
this. I mean, what they do is they want to have you file
within a year. And they say, well, but if you filed
within a year and you're in State court, we don't care
anymore. You're being -- if you file in the wrong State
court, you're tolled. We don't really care once you're
proceeding. And now, however, if you go in -- into
Federal court by mistake instead of State court by
mistake, well, you're out of luck on a random basis. Some
judges will get you back in on time. Other judges won't.
Is there anything in the history or anywhere --
I -- I'm interested in the history from your point of
view, as much as the other. Is there anything that
suggests that Congress cared about that?
MR. LONG: Not that I've found, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Either way.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If that's so, then why isn't
a system like the one that the Second Circuit described
the most reasonable thing to do, that is, to put very
tight deadlines both on the petitioner and on the Federal
court, that is, to deny -- deny the stay and abey when the
prisoner has not been diligent, to put a tight time line
on when that prisoner has to go to State court, and a
similarly tight line on returning to the Federal court
after the State court is done? And you could check
against repeatedly abusing this by saying, and you get
only one opportunity to do it.
MR. LONG: I think the answer to the question,
Your Honor, is that in order to follow the Second Circuit
as you've described, this Court would have to rewrite the
interpretation of the exhaustion statute that they issued
in Rose v. Lundy. That's my belief because Rose v. Lundy
-- or the statute, as interpreted by Rose v. Lundy
indicates that at a minimum, the unexhausted claims ought
to be dismissed without prejudice and sent back for
exhaustion in State court.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But Rose and Lundy also assumed
that they could go back to State court and -- and in -- in
fact this could be done without wiping out the claims.
And the difference between the situation in Rose and Lundy
and the situation we've got now is the difference which is
focused, I think, in -- in Justice Ginsburg's four claims
as to which there was disagreement even between the
district court and -- and the State as to whether there
was exhaustion. There -- there isn't a -- a -- as a -- as
a systemic matter across the United States, there simply
isn't a way for most of these people to go back and
litigate their State claims. Rose and Lundy assumed there
was. Now there isn't.
MR. LONG: Your Honor, if the petitioner is not
capable of going back to litigate the State claim, the
claim is not unexhausted by definition. And --
JUSTICE SOUTER: It may not be -- it -- it will
be waived. I mean, if -- if -- on your theory, he -- he
jumps from the frying pan of nonexhaustion into the fire
of waiver. That's -- that's no answer to the problem.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: See, you could -- there are
two things in Rose v. Lundy, and everybody agrees with the
one, you must exhaust in State court. You cannot have the
Federal court take a first view of that question. You --
you must exhaust. And -- but then Rose v. Lundy also said
without prejudice, and your reading strikes out without
prejudice not based on the defendant's conduct, not based
on the petitioner's conduct, but because it took the
district court more than the limitation period just to
sort out which claims were exhausted and which weren't.
MR. LONG: I think there are two responses to
that, Your Honor. First of all, the -- the fact of
whether it is without prejudice in fact or in law is
driven by how much time is left on the statute of
limitations. A dismissal without prejudice at the time
the amended petition was filed in this case would have
left 80 days on the statute and he could have pursued his
-- his remedy in State court and tolled the statute.
Now, in the -- in the more common situation with
the habeas petitioner, I think the answer has to be
Congress has changed the landscape. They have changed the
landscape relying upon the total exhaustion rule in --
that they enacted and that this Court has interpreted.
And they have added the statute of limitations and they've
added the tolling provisions, and that has to be entered
into the computation.
Now, I think that that simply raises the bar for
all petitioners to make doubly sure that if they have a
claim, they have presented it to a State court judge
because they -- they --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the troublesome
thing is some petitioners will be able to do just what you
said in South Dakota, go back to the State court a second
time, because they had a swift district judge, and some
won't because the district judge was slow. So to treat
identically situated petitioners differently not because
of any lapse on the petitioner's part but solely because
one had the luck to get before a swift district judge and
the other, the bad luck to get before a procrastinator,
that seems arbitrary and not anything that Congress built
into the statute.
MR. LONG: Your Honor, I -- I struggle with the
-- one of the premises of your hypothetical, and the
portion I struggle with is the -- is the situation where
the petitioner, through no fault of his own, either -- and
I think that's implied in your hypothetical -- doesn't go
to State court. I -- I think that that is -- I think that
that's the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, did go. Did. Every one
of these cases, I say if they came rushing to the Federal
court first, no Federal judge would even consider giving
them a stay so they can go to the first -- first time.
But these -- these come up where someone has
gone to the State court and then they come to the Federal
court with a new petition and there's arguments about what
they exhausted and what they didn't. I'm -- I'm leaving
out the person who never went to the Federal -- State
court at all. That person is -- is not the category that
this case represents. This case represents the one who
goes to State court and comes to the Federal court and
has arguably some additional claims.
MR. LONG: The -- there's the -- the difficulty
in the stay and abeyance procedure, as it is currently
practiced, I think, is that there is no set of standards,
other than the three statutes that we've -- that we have
discussed, to guide the district court's discretion in
when they give stay and abeyance.
JUSTICE SCALIA: General Long, do -- do those
States that apply stay and abey make a distinction between
whether the person who comes with unexhausted claims has
exhausted some claims in State court and ones who haven't?
MR. LONG: Well, I think the predicate to
getting stay and abeyance, Your Honor, is that there has
to be at least the presence of one exhausted claim and one
unexhausted --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why should that be?
MR. LONG: Well, I think that that follows from
-- I think that follows from Rose v. Lundy which talked
about a mixed petition and that's the -- that's the
factual background.
JUSTICE SCALIA: If you get a second bite, why
shouldn't you get a first bite? I mean, I -- I don't see
-- I don't see any reason for treating preferentially the
-- the person who files in State court but does not file
new claims, which he should have known to file at that
time, and treating the person who comes to the Federal
court with those new claims but doesn't have -- doesn't
have even one that he took to State court. I -- I don't
see any reason to be merciful to one and not the other.
MR. LONG: Well, I think the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're -- but you're
telling me the States do draw a distinction.
MR. LONG: Well, I don't think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean -- I mean --
MR. LONG: -- it's not distinction. I'm sorry.
The Federal court --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, hasn't the second --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the difference is that one
of those petitions could be totally dismissed and the
other one would not be. If there were no exhaustion
whatsoever, they -- they'd plainly dismiss the Federal
case.
MR. LONG: I think so, yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Whereas, if there's one
exhausted claim, they could -- they could keep the Federal
-- petition in Federal court and stay it and let the
unexhausted claim be exhausted.
MR. LONG: Well, that's -- that's the -- it's
the stay that we're having the problem with, Justice
Stevens. But -- but if there is the presence of one
unexhausted claim, the -- the total exhaustion
requirement --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And the judge could dismiss
the others.
MR. LONG: He -- he can dismiss the unexhausted
one and move forward. And -- and, of course, what has
happened in the -- since the -- the landscape has changed
since 1982 and because now the 1-year statute and the
tolling provisions, there is more sanction for that
dismissal under the total exhaustion requirement than
there used to be.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: General Long, if you were
designing a system to set standards to guide the Federal
judge in deciding how to treat these, what standards would
you set?
MR. LONG: That's a hard question, Your Honor,
because --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do your best.
(Laughter.)
MR. LONG: I -- I think this, Your Honor. I --
I think the court, faced with a mixed petition, ought to
first ask why have you not -- if -- if there is truly an
unexhausted claim in this petition, why did you not
present that claim previously in State court. And after
that, if -- if the -- if the answer to that is not
satisfactory, I think that the -- I think that that ought
to be tested on, for example, the cause and prejudice
standard or the actual innocence or fundamental
miscarriage of justice standards which this Court has
announced to cure procedural defaults in extreme cases.
But in the absence of those type of standards, I
think that stay and abeyance has been simply applied too
broadly and this case is a classic example of the
misapplication of stay and abeyance.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, are you suggesting then
that we could have a rule, oh, somewhat like the grant of
a preliminary injunction? If it's a likelihood of success
on the merits, if it's a fundamental right, if there's
reason for maybe mistake and not having exhausted, then --
then you'd allow a stay and abeyance?
MR. LONG: Well, I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because if you have that, we
then have a new Gothic jurisprudence where we're reviewing
discretion on a collateral issue.
MR. LONG: Well, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Rococo I think.
MR. LONG: Well, the -- the difficulty with the
way it is now, Your Honor, is there is no review of the
discretion of the district courts at all. I mean, they
simply do it, and --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose the suggestion
I made --
MR. LONG: -- and it's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is preferable than the one
I gave. Would you adopt that or would you insist just
that there be no stay and abey at all?
MR. LONG: Well, our first position, obviously,
is no stay and abey at all, that the unexhausted claims
ought to be dismissed, as the Eighth Circuit said in this
case. And if they -- if they are truly unexhausted, then
there is going to be a remedy in State court, and State
courts are perfectly capable of identifying constitutional
remedies and -- and meting out the requirements. I've had
-- I've had South Dakota judges send murder cases back to
me to try after 12 years, and it's -- it's a burdensome
thing, and those cases need to move forward.
But what I would envision, Justice Kennedy, is
this, that the rule ought to be that -- that the -- the --
that the case is sent back to State court if there is
truly, as -- as the name implies, an unexhausted claim,
implying that there is an available State remedy. If --
if resolution in the State courts does not resolve it, if
the case comes back in some fashion, then the court needs
to apply some standards like cause and prejudice or
fundamental miscarriage of justice, which -- which is what
is applied in -- in procedural default cases, and -- and
deal with it on that basis.
But the -- the current lack of discretion with
reference to how stay and abeyance is applied is in my
judgment the -- that is the -- that is the most
fundamental problem with --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But again --
MR. LONG: -- stay and abeyances.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I come -- I come back to
the -- the Second Circuit tried to deal with that problem
and why isn't that adequate? They didn't leave the
district judges to do whatever was their will.
MR. LONG: The -- well, the -- the Second
Circuit followed very closely to what the -- what the
district court did here, Your Honor, but what I did not
see in the Second Circuit opinions and frankly haven't
seen in any of the opinions except the Eighth Circuit
opinion was any type of analysis about an explanation of
why the petitioner hadn't been prudent and hadn't been
diligent in State court. And -- and in the absence of any
kind of inquiry like that, I think that stay and abeyance
simply is -- is -- it's unguided. There are no standards.
If there are no questions, thank you very much.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, General Long.
Mr. Lange, you have 7 minutes left, and normally
I wouldn't intrude on your rebuttal time, but I would like
to ask you to comment on one thought.
Do you think it would be appropriate before a
district judge ever grants a stay and -- and abeyance
procedure, to make some kind of a preliminary, not exactly
a probable cause determination, but some kind of a
determination as to whether or not there is arguable merit
to the State claim that he wants to stay the proceedings
to -- to allow him to exhaust?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTO A. LANGE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LANGE: Yes, I do, Justice Stevens. I
believe that a district court, in evaluating a request for
stay and abeyance, should look to make sure that the
petition meets the standards of section 2254(b)(2) which
is the provision that allows a district court to reach the
merits of unexhausted claims to deny them. It's similar
to what the Court has now promulgated as rule 4 of the
rules governing habeas corpus cases. I think it makes
sense for the district court first to look at -- at
whether there's merit to the petition because there really
is no sense to hold in abeyance, pending exhaustion in
State court, claims that lack merit.
Obviously, to get stay and abeyance, the
petitioner will have had to file timely within his AEDPA
period, and the court will have had to have held the case
either through the expiration of the AEDPA period or you
can imagine some scenarios where on the 364th day --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's one thing to say
that there's -- it's utterly without merit and he can deny
it, which he's entitled to do under the statute. It's
another thing to say that there's a high probability of
success on the merits. I'm afraid that most of the claims
are going to fall in between. The district judge just
doesn't know absent testimony, et cetera, et cetera.
MR. LANGE: Right, and those should be
circumstances where the State court is left to judge
whether the claim has merit while the Federal court
proceedings are suspended, are abeyed or held in abeyance.
It makes sense, under the exhaustion norms of this Court,
to let the State courts pass judgment first on claims that
have sufficient merit where they can't be disposed of
under rule 4 of the rules governing habeas corpus.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. -- Mr. Lange, why -- why
isn't -- gee, you have Lange and Long. Why isn't Attorney
General Long's assertion sensible? That is to say, it's
an extraordinary thing to have Federal district courts in
all criminal cases reviewing the work of State supreme
courts. We -- we got into this in an era when we couldn't
trust State supreme courts, especially in racial cases.
But that's where we are now.
But why is it unreasonable to say, look, you get
one shot at coming to Federal court? And if -- if you --
if you bungle that and you haven't exhausted first, we're
not denying your claims. Go back to State court. We're
just not going to reintervene as Federal courts. Your --
your claims are not dead. Justice is not denied. You
just have to go back through the State system and we're
not going to blue pencil the work of the State system a
second time. That's all. Why isn't that reasonable?
MR. LANGE: Well, this is Mr. Rhines' one
opportunity. Congress did give in section 2254(a)
jurisdiction to the courts and said the Federal courts
shall entertain petitions of this -- of this nature. So
this is a -- a right that Mr. Rhines has to have these
entertained. He filed timely.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, to have exhausted
claims entertained. Right? Is there some -- do you say
there is some absolute right to have the Federal court
hear unexhausted claims?
MR. LANGE: Well, under (b)(1), a claim must be
exhausted to support relief from a Federal court. That is
right, Your Honor. And these claims -- if under the
petitioner B scenario, the court had ruled promptly or the
claims were less complex, allowing them to be disposed of
earlier, Mr. Rhines could have had or -- and should have
all of his claims before the district court to be
resolved.
The Court needs to be watchful here not to
penalize Mr. Rhines and people who are in similar
situations because they have complex claims.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, this is not a pro se
petitioner.
MR. LANGE: No. He is represented by counsel,
obviously, Your Honor.
I -- I think it inappropriate to draw lines
between pro se and represented counsel, though, in the
realm of habeas. That I think invites trouble. So the
rule you formulate is obviously not only for Rhines but
for pro se litigants as well that -- that deserve
consideration.
This exhaustion rule is not to be an -- a trap
for the unwary pro se petitioner. The whole purpose of
the exhaustion rule, as this Court said in Keeney v.
Tamayo-Reyes, is to -- not to erect a hurdle on the path
to Federal habeas court, but to channel claims into an
appropriate forum. And stay and abeyance does just that.
It prohibits further proceeding on a mixed petition in
Federal court and channels, indeed requires, as a term of
the order that the petitioner go and exhaust the remaining
State remedy and come back to court with one exhausted
claim. That is what Rose v. Lundy contemplated and
allowed with the dismissal without prejudice.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Earlier you -- you suggested
that in your view the district court could deny it.
MR. LANGE: If under section 2254(b)(2) it does
not meet the standard, yes. Congress has allowed, because
exhaustion is not jurisdictional, for district courts to
reach the merits, albeit to deny unexhausted claims.
That's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Lange, you were appointed
by the Court, and on behalf of the Court, I want to thank
you for your services and for the quality of your
services.
MR. LANGE: Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:32 p.m., the case in the
