CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 12-515,
Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community.
Mr. Bursch.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
After Bay Mills' concession on the first
question presented, the only issue is whether Bay Mills
enjoys blanket immunity from suit when it engages in
illegal, off-reservation, commercial conduct.  And the
answer is no, for at least two reasons.
First, it makes no sense that Congress
intended States to have a Federal injunctive remedy for
illegal gaming on reservation, but no injunctive remedy
if that gaming takes place on land that is subject to
the State's exclusive jurisdiction.
Second, a tribe should not have greater
immunity than foreign nations.  There's no dispute that,
if France opened up an illegal business in Michigan,
casino or otherwise, it would have no blanket immunity.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, before you go
on, could you address the jurisdiction question for me?
I'm not sure why you're here.  The only injunction that
I see was entered on behalf of Little -- Little
Traverse's and not on behalf of the State.
But -- and so, the counts that you're
arguing about were added after the injunction was
issued.  How do you have jurisdiction to act -- to argue
someone else's injunction?
MR. BURSCH:  That's not quite correct,
Justice Sotomayor.  Originally, this case was filed as
two separate lawsuits.  Michigan was a plaintiff, and
then the other tribe was a plaintiff in the separate
case.  Those cases were consolidated, and then when the
motion for injunction was filed, Michigan joined in that
motion, filed a brief supporting it, and everyone
proceeded under the assumption that both the tribe and
the State were asking for the injunction.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That, in fact, is not
what the district court said.  The district court
explicitly said in its order granting the injunction
that the State hadn't filed an injunction, hadn't
intervened, and had only filed supporting papers in
support of Little Traverse's case.
I'm a little -- I'm very, very confused as I
look at what the district court said.  It explicitly
said you weren't part of the order.
MR. BURSCH:  Well, again, they were
consolidated cases.  We were supporting the
injunction --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think "consolidated"
can have two meanings and -- and -- to be heard together
or to be joined together.  I don't think the district
court understood that this was going to be joined
together.  Why did it say what it did?
MR. BURSCH:  Well, I think it was
everybody's understanding that these were joined
together because the parties were pursuing the exact
same issues.  And so then, once this went up to the
Sixth Circuit, there was no question in the Sixth
Circuit's mind --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why didn’t you file an
injunction -- why does your brief say that you filed it
only in support of Little Traverse and not on your own
behalf?
MR. BURSCH:  Because, once the cases were
consolidated -- and at that point, we were even using
the same docket entries, there was already a motion on
file, so there was no need to have a second motion.  It
was clear to everyone that the State of Michigan and the
tribe were both pursuing that injunctive relief
together.  And that's exactly the way the Sixth Circuit
treated it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'll ask -- I'll ask
your opposition, but I don't see why the district court
would have made the point it did, if it believed that it
was dealing with both of you as parties.
MR. BURSCH:  Well, everyone has proceeded up
the chain, including in the Sixth Circuit opinion, on
the assumption that it was consolidated, that Michigan
was requesting an injunction and, in fact, that kind of
a procedural objection has never been raised by anybody,
certainly not at the petition stage.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, but we have to -- we
have to, if we're not sure, raise any jurisdictional
issue.
MR. BURSCH:  Sure.  But I think it was
eminently clear to the Sixth Circuit, if you read its
opinion --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it wasn't
eminently clear to the district court who entered the
order.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that a
jurisdictional objection or a procedural one?
MR. BURSCH:  Your Honor, it's a procedural
objection.  The only jurisdictional question in this
case is whether there's Federal question jurisdiction
under 1331, which has been conceded, and the United
States agrees to that, and so I'm not going to spend my
time on that.  Where I would like to spend my time is on
the scope of tribal immunity.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before you do that, can
you tell -- tell us why Michigan didn't resort to the
dispute resolution means that the compact provided?  The
compact said, if there's a dispute, it'll be decided by
arbitration.  Michigan bypassed that.
MR. BURSCH:  That's correct, Justice
Ginsburg, and there were two reasons for that.  The
first is that that provision was only discretionary, as
we explain in our reply brief.  But even more important,
the compact also makes clear that the tribe did not
waive its sovereign immunity for purposes of
arbitration.
So if we had gone to arbitration and
prevailed, if the arbitrator had reached the same result
as the Federal government did, as to the status of these
lands being not Indian lands, then --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  Could you
explain that?  Because I thought that the purpose --
that the whole point of the C&L Enterprises case is to
say that when a tribe agrees to arbitration, it has
waived its sovereign immunity for that purpose in that
proceeding.  Are you saying that there was something
special in this agreement?
MR. BURSCH:  I am, Justice Kagan, and I'm
glad you brought up C&L because, there, you had a
construction contract where there was invocation of an
arbitration remedy and it didn't specifically preserve
tribal immunity.
Here, we have the exact opposite.  In the
same paragraph 7 of the compact where we have the
arbitration provision, the tribe and the State agree
that, notwithstanding the arbitration provision, both
parties' sovereign immunity is not waived and that
it's -- it's preserved.
So, if we took a successful arbitration
judgment and then tried to reduce that to a Federal
judgment in court, they would have asserted immunity and
we would be in the exact same procedural posture that we
are right now, talking about the scope of tribal
immunity involving illegal off-reservation gaming.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why -- why did --
along the same lines, why did you assert sovereign
immunity as a defense when the tribe brought a
declaratory judgment action concerning the status of
those lands?
MR. BURSCH:  Because, again, it wouldn't
have done any good for us to stipulate to jurisdiction
on the tribe's claim about the status of the lands
because simply having a declaratory judgment wouldn't
have given us any relief.  We would have had to file a
counterclaim for injunctive relief and the tribe,
undoubtedly, would have filed -- or
would have
asserted a tribal immunity there as well.
So, really, all roads lead to tribal
immunity, no matter how --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All roads lead to one
issue, I think.  If you had gotten a declaratory
judgment, they would have had to stop their gaming
activity.
MR. BURSCH:  No --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you wouldn't have
gotten their property; isn't that what this suit is
about, you trying to take over the -- the casino?
MR. BURSCH:  No, we don't want to take over
the casino.  We want to stop illegal gaming on lands,
subject to Michigan's exclusive jurisdiction.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why not Ex Parte
Young?  You point to one or two cases in the lower
courts that suggest there not might be Ex Parte Young
jurisdiction, but those cases are distinguishable.  So
why not go after just the officials?
MR. BURSCH:  Two responses to that, Justice
Sotomayor, one, kind of a practical consideration and
then one a broader federalism principle that I -- that I
want to emphasize.  The narrow practical point is that
Ex Parte Young is an imperfect remedy for lots of
reasons, as we express in the brief.
It's well settled that you can't get
specific performance on the contract, you can't enforce
a State law in Federal court, you can't get money or
seize assets in an Ex Parte Young action.  And that's
why lower courts --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But all you wanted to do
was stop them from doing the gaming casino.
MR. BURSCH:  Well, it's not clear --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You would have gotten
that.
MR. BURSCH:  It's not clear at all to us
that we would be able to get that relief, based on the
lower court holdings.
Now, the bigger sovereignty point is that,
if a foreign country, if France or Haiti came in and
opened the same casino, the State would have the full
panoply of remedies available to it.  And it should have
those remedies because any additional immunity you give
to the tribe, when it's engaging in illegal conduct on
lands subject to Michigan's exclusive jurisdiction, you
are necessarily taking away from the sovereign authority
of the State of Michigan.  That's a lesser remedy.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's -- all that -- the
enigma that you pointed out -- or the anomaly is -- is
certainly clear.  But what about Kiowa?  This Court
seemed to say that the tribe is immune on reservation,
off reservation, commercial activity, government
activity, it is immune, blanket immunity.
So how can you prevail without having this
Court modify Kiowa.
MR. BURSCH:  Here's how, Justice Ginsburg:
Because Kiowa involved a private party plaintiff.  It
did not involve a sovereign State.  And this Court has
stated, repeatedly, that States are different.  We are
constitutional sovereigns, and so we aren't treated like
ordinary business plaintiffs.
In that case, the fact that the plaintiff
could not enforce his promissory note did not directly
implicate a State police power.  Here --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's your best
authority -- what's your best case for that proposition?
MR. BURSCH:  For the proposition that States
are different?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That -- that States have a
lesser burden when they're faced with a sovereign
immunity defense?
MR. BURSCH:  I wouldn't say that it's a
lesser burden, but I think you need to analyze this as a
zero sum gain, that when you're talking about activity
taking place on sovereign State land and you're not
allowing the State to have its whole panoply of
remedies, that you've taken away an attribute of
sovereignty that -- that would have existed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's your best case for
that?
MR. BURSCH:  I would basically just cite all
of the cases this Court has decided over the last
quarter century involving the ADA, the ADEA, where this
Court has consistently recognized that States are
different.  Sovereigns --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You know, that's -- that's
a big reading assignment.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  The question is this:
Three situations -- I think it's the same question
Justice Kennedy was driving at.  One, France opens up a
casino.
MR. BURSCH:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Two, California opens up a
casino.
MR. BURSCH:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Three, an Indian tribe
opens up a casino, okay?
MR. BURSCH:  Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what is it that says
that the State where the casino is located can sue
France?  What is it that says it can sue California?
All -- they all object.  What is it that says it can sue
the Indian tribe?
MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Justice Breyer.
And, Justice Kennedy, hopefully, this will reduce the
reading assignment.
The case that says we can sue France is
Alfred Dunhill, which was this Court's decision that
first recognized the commercial distinction for foreign
nation immunity.  Now --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, was that a statute or
common law?
MR. BURSCH:  That was common law, common law
development in Alfred Dunhill.
Now, shortly after that, Congress did enact
the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which essentially
codified this Court's common law rule, and once that
happens, then the common law development --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  California?
MR. BURSCH:  So California, the case is
Nevada v. Hall in which -- this case said that a State's
sovereign immunity from suit does not extend when it's
got actors in another State.  There, Nevada's agent was
acting in California, and the Court held that that actor
could be liable for suit in California.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  All those are common
law.  Both --
MR. BURSCH:  All common law.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Then what do you do about
Kiowa?
MR. BURSCH:  Well, that's the thing.  Kiowa
or Kiowa did not involve a State as sovereign.  It
involved a private business plaintiff, and it's
distinguishable on that basis.
And if you disagree with me and you think
that sovereign States should be treated the same way as
private party plaintiffs, then we would ask you to
overrule that part of Kiowa which suggested that tribes
can engage in illegal commercial conduct on land subject
to exclusive State jurisdiction without any --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I think this is what
Justice Kennedy was -- was getting at, when he asked you
for a case, because what you're saying now is that when
the State is the plaintiff --
MR. BURSCH:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- the sovereign immunity of
the tribe disappears, so --
MR. BURSCH:  Well, not disappears.  But
it -- it disappears when they move off reservation and
they're acting in a commercial capacity.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So what -- I guess
what's -- what's -- what's the case that would suggest
that, when the plaintiff shifts, the sovereign immunity
is -- goes away?
MR. BURSCH:  This Court's case that would
suggest that is the Oklahoma Tax Commission case because
that was a case where a State, not exercising a police
power, but one of its lesser powers, the power of
taxation, was attempting to tax cigarettes that were
being sold on Indian trust land by a tribe.
And in that case, the Court acknowledged
that, even on trust lands -- so this isn't on land
that's subject to State exclusive jurisdiction, that the
State would be able to tax those cigarettes being sold
to non-tribal members.  It's not --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You know, but the question
specifically then -- I think we're driving at the same
thing -- is, remember, you just cited to me two cases --
MR. BURSCH:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- one involving France and
one involving California.
MR. BURSCH:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And I had assumed -- but
maybe I was wrong to assume -- that when I read those
cases, I will see, although a State can sue France,
although Nevada can sue California, a private individual
could not.  Am I going to find that when I read those
two cases?
MR. BURSCH:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, I think the answer to
Justice Kagan is I'm not going to find it.  So we're
looking for authority, back to Justice Kennedy, that
will support your proposition that the State could sue
France, Nevada could sue California, but a private
individual could not.
MR. BURSCH:  I think the Oklahoma Tax
Commission case would be the closest because, even if
you had a private individual who was trying to sue a
tribe for conduct that was taking place on trust land,
they would not be able to do it.  What --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what you're asking us
to do then, if the answer is what I now think you're
saying, is to say it's awfully complicated that,
although a State could sue an Indian tribe for something
that is outside the reservation, the State -- it's so
complicated that I'd like some good authority for it,
because a private person couldn't, but a State could
sue, and it's only in certain places.
MR. BURSCH:  Well, there -- there's lots of
places that you could draw the line in this case.
JUSTICE BREYER:  How about drawing the line
with Kiowa?
MR. BURSCH:  Here's what I'm going to
suggest:  Nine justices in Kiowa, both the majority and
the dissent, recognized that there were substantial
issues with applying tribal immunity on or off
reservation in the commercial context.
This Court had done away with that for
foreign nations in Alfred Dunhill.  It decided to give
Congress one more chance in -- in Kiowa, but -- but left
the question open for further common law development.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But once the Congress
didn't respond, the majority opinion in Kiowa -- I don't
know whether it's "Kiowa" or "Kiowa" -- said -- you
know, this is an unfortunate result, but Congress can do
something about it.  Well, now Congress hasn't done
anything about it, and you are asking this Court,
essentially, to modify the -- that precedent.
MR. BURSCH:  I am.  I mean, I don't think
you need to modify it.  I think you could distinguish it
based on the fact that there's a private party plaintiff
there.  But if you feel otherwise, that you need to
modify it in order to rule in our favor, it's -- it's
totally within your power.
As we explained, at length in the context of
foreign nation sovereign immunity, it's a body of common
law that this Court is free to modify as appropriate.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why is the -- why is
that important?  Why is the issue that you've brought
before us important?  In addition to the possibility of
an Ex Parte Young action, you could certainly arrest
people who are running what you believe is an illegal
casino in the State, can't you?
MR. BURSCH:  Well, there are -- there are at
least two reasons why that is also an imperfect remedy.
The most obvious one is that it creates exactly the kind
of inter-sovereign conflict that Congress was trying to
avoid when it allowed, under IGRA, for States to get
injunctions, even for on-reservation conduct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But, in addition to that,
couldn't you have stopped this before it even started by
insisting in the compact that the tribe waive sovereign
immunity?
MR. BURSCH:  Well, that's -- that's a great
question, and the answer to that is twofold.  First,
when the compact was negotiated back in 1993, this Court
had not decided Kiowa.  That came five years later in
1998.  And so Congress and the States reasonably assumed
at that time that, if a tribe was engaged in illegal
commercial conduct off reservation, that, of course, a
State would have the ability --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Going forward then --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why couldn't you at
least -- I think this is Justice Alito's question.  I
don't mean to interrupt.  But why couldn't you say that
it's a matter of compact interpretation whether these
are Indian lands?
MR. BURSCH:  A matter of compact
interpretation whether these are Indian lands?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right.  So you go to
Federal court to interpret the contract.  There's no --
immunity has been waived, and you say these are not
Indian lands.  I think that's what Justice Alito was
asking.  I didn't mean to interrupt him.
MR. BURSCH:  I -- I didn't get quite the
same question from Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's a more
sophisticated version of my question.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  Seriously, it gets into
a more -- more difficult issue.
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  Well, if I can finish
answering Justice Alito's question.  You asked why we
can't just go in and arrest.  And -- and the second
answer to that, besides the -- the conflict of going in
with armed police guards and arresting tribal officials
and hauling them off to county jail, which Congress
tried to avoid when it enacted IGRA in the first place,
it's what everybody wanted.
Again, it's limiting State sovereignty --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I understand that.
MR. BURSCH:  -- any time you take out
our --
JUSTICE ALITO:  But going forward, is this
of any importance?  Why --
MR. BURSCH:  Oh, this is of tremendous
importance.
JUSTICE ALITO:  It seems to me, if a tribe
wants to open a casino and the State has to -- it has to
have a compact with the State, isn't all the bargaining
power on the -- on the side of the State?  So the State
says, fine, if you want to do that, you have to waive
sovereign immunity?
MR. BURSCH:  Well, we had a compact in place
in 1993 that limited their casinos, so that this
wouldn't happen.  Going forward --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- but I mean, when
will -- when will this compact expire?
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  Let me give you a very
practical answer to that question.  This compact, in
1993, had a 20-year term on it.  And so it essentially
expired at the end of -- of November, just a few days
ago, although it has an evergreen clause that allows it
to continue while the parties try to negotiate a new
compact.
And, as you would imagine, the very first
thing Michigan asked for in its proposed amended compact
was to waive tribal sovereign immunity to deal with
issues like this.  And, unsurprisingly, the tribe said,
we're really not interested in that; we kind of like the
way the sovereignty issue is preserved in the existing
compact.
Now, the question about whether this has an
impact beyond tribal gaming, the answer is --
JUSTICE ALITO:  If I could just pursue that?
MR. BURSCH:  Sure.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So the compact has expired,
and there's -- so then how can they operate the casino?
MR. BURSCH:  Well, it hasn't expired.  Until
the parties --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Until they reach a new
compact, it continues.
MR. BURSCH:  Until they reach a new compact,
it continues in effect.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is the status of the
land as Indian lands determined by the compact?
MR. BURSCH:  No, it's not determined by the
compact.  It would be determined as a matter of Federal
law.  That's the Federal question in this case.  And --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I ask you a
question?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the compact refers to
Indian lands.  Surely, you could take the position that
there is a waiver of immunity to determine whether or
not these are Indian lands under the compact.
MR. BURSCH:  I don't think we could,
respectfully, Justice Kennedy, because the compact does
not envision that the tribe has waived immunity for any
purposes.  If you look at Section 7 of the compact,
it's -- it's really unequivocal about the tribe not
waiving immunity.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I ask you a
question?  What -- what would happen if this were Indian
lands, and they went ahead and did exactly what they
did?  They -- there was no dispute that these were
Indian lands.
Would you have had grounds to object to them
building a casino on these lands.
MR. BURSCH:  We would not.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You would not?
MR. BURSCH:  Correct.  If these are Indian
lands, then it's permissible under IGRA and under the
compact for them to have and operate a casino.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  The issue of
what constitutes Indian lands is between the Federal
government and the Indians, pursuant to the Land Trust
Settlement, correct?
MR. BURSCH:  I disagree with that because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I know you do, and
I know why you do.  But -- but what defines the lands is
the Settlement Trust, correct?
MR. BURSCH:  Federal court interpretation of
the Michigan Indian Land Claims Settlement Act, yes,
would determine the status of these lands.  The reason
why it's not just between the tribe and the Federal
government is because Michigan has a huge interest in
having lands that are currently under its exclusive
sovereign jurisdiction be determined to be Indian
lands --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Put -- put this aside of
gambling.  Let's assume that it was just their buying
this land.
MR. BURSCH:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you have stopped
the buying of this land or unravelled it?  Didn't we
have a recent decision that said no?
MR. BURSCH:  If you're referring to the --
the Patchak case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.
MR. BURSCH:  In that case, you held that the
plaintiff could, quite a bit after the fact, file a
lawsuit to unravel that transaction, if the lands were
not eligible for Indian gaming, if I'm remembering the
holding correctly.  And -- and Michigan does have a
substantial interest, not just in the gaming context.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, wouldn't you have
had to follow -- if you were going to object to this
land being taken into the land trust, wouldn't you have
had to follow the administrative process?
MR. BURSCH:  We would, but the land has
never been taken in trust.  Even the Federal government,
the National Indian Gaming Commission, has concluded
that these are not Indian lands for purposes of the
Settlement Act.  And so we never got to the point where
they got in Patchak, where they went through the
administrative process to take the lands in trust.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, if -- if I could
assume that this is not Indian lands and just ask why
you need for sovereign immunity to go away?  And -- so
you have the ability to arrest people.  You have the
ability to bring Ex Parte Young actions.
Presumably, you have the ability on
non-Indian lands simply to shut down a casino.
Presumably, you have the ability on non-Indian lands to
condition any licensing of the casino on whatever you
want.
I guess the question is:  On non-Indian
lands, you have a thousand ways to stop a casino that
you don't want.  Why do you need the abrogation of
sovereign immunity?
MR. BURSCH:  Because we tried to take the
least intrusive means necessary to stop the casino, to
not go in with the billy clubs and the guns and to
arrest tribal members, but to ask for a Federal civil
injunction.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I think that all of
our cases suggest that sovereign immunity is quite
important to a sovereign's dignity and that it's not
nothing to abrogate sovereign immunity.  And so you can
say, well -- you know, that would be less intrusive than
all these other things, bringing Ex Parte Young suits,
arresting people, just -- you know, conditioning the --
a license, stopping the casino from operating.
But -- you know, I suspect that the
sovereign tribe here would say that, no, it's -- it's an
affront to their sovereignty to take -- to strip them of
sovereign immunity, and -- and none of these other
options that you have are that.
MR. BURSCH:  Right.  But, again, arresting
the other sovereign's officers is, with all respect, not
respectful to the tribe, which is why that's the course
we've pursued.  And the change we're asking for here is
not as big as the tribe makes it seem because, in IGRA,
Section 2710, we have the ability to get an injunction
to stop illegal gaming taking place on reservation.
And so it's really not that big a leap to
say, if they're engaging in illegal gaming off
reservation, likewise, there, we should be able to get
the least intrusive remedy, the one that is most
respectful of the tribe's sovereignty.
And, frankly, we're kind of surprised that
the United States would take the position that we're
better off going in and arresting or suing individual
officers because that's not the way sovereigns are
supposed to interact.
And it would be a big deal if France opened
up a casino in Michigan and, rather than seeking a civil
injunction, we tried to arrest the French president and
throw them in a Michigan County jail.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, is -- is it not
correct that the people who work in these casinos are
just employees?  They have no other connection with the
tribe?  Am I wrong on that?
MR. BURSCH:  I believe some of the employees
are tribal members, some are not.  And we cite a number
of cases in our reply brief where tribal immunity has
been extended to tribal employees whether they are
members of the tribe or not.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can you prosecute
people who frequent this illegal casino?
MR. BURSCH:  Sue Michigan citizens?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
MR. BURSCH:  Yes, we could do that.  But --
you know, again, I want you to understand the scope of
the invasion of the State's sovereignty here.  If any
other entity, foreign nation, another State, an
individual, set up an illegal business, whether it's
prostitution, underage drinking, gaming, you name it, we
would have the full panoply of State civil and criminal
regulatory remedies available to us and could pick the
most appropriate one.
And, somehow, because this is a tribe, even
though they are operating on Michigan's land, where we
have exclusive regulatory jurisdiction, somehow, all
those remedies are circumscribed to imperfect remedies,
like Ex parte Young, which may or may not be successful,
or arresting our own citizens, and that's not respecting
the constitutional sovereign that Michigan represents in
this case.
And to get back to a question a number of
you had about the implications of this aside from
gaming, this happens in all kinds of other contexts off
reservation.  You just had a case in 2011 involving the
Oneida tribe in New York, where they failed to pay their
property taxes in New York.  And so the State moved in
to foreclose for nonpayment of taxes those
off-reservation properties.
And the Second Circuit, interpreting Kiowa,
reluctantly concluded that the State did not have
ability to enforce by foreclosing on that property
because the tribe had immunity and invited this Court to
review Kiowa.  This Court granted cert.  Eventually,
cert was dismissed because the tribe waived immunity,
and they were able to go forward and pursue that remedy.
But -- you know, whether it's in the tax
context, whether it's the gaming context, whether it's
the criminal context -- you know, the amici briefs of
Oklahoma and Alabama are replete with the issues that
they are having as sovereigns in running up against the
tribal sovereign immunity when it comes to these
contexts.
If there are no further questions, I will
reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Katyal.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
I would like to begin where my friend did
not, with the text of the statute.  Congress enacted
Subsection (A)(ii), like the rest of IGRA, to address
gaming solely on Indian lands.  In fact, Congress used
that phrase "on Indian lands" a whopping 24 times in
IGRA.  By contrast, IGRA says not a word about
off-Indian-lands activity.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you think Congress
really wanted the States to have power to stop illegal
gambling on Indian lands, but not to have the power to
stop illegal gaming on State lands?  Is that -- is that
the law you think Congress wrote?
MR. KATYAL:  I do think so, and if I could
say first of all --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why would anybody want such
a -- such a disposition?
MR. KATYAL:  Two reasons, Your Honor, why I
think Congress made the choice they did.  But, even
before that, I don't think that's the proper inquiry for
this Court.  The proper inquiry for this Court, as C&L
and other cases have said, is it requires an unequivocal
expression of purpose of Congress before tribal immunity
is abrogated, and we don't get into this kind of
question of what Congress might have thought, which
creates a guessing game.
But, just to answer your question, why would
Congress have thought that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you think that rule
would apply even when, at the time the statute in
question was enacted, there was no belief that there was
tribal immunity on State lands?
MR. KATYAL:  Well, Your Honor, I know my
friend on the other side has said that.  That is just
flatly wrong.  Puyallup, in 1977, Your Honor, precisely
said that it involved both on- and off-reservation
activity, it was commercial activity, it was fishing,
and this Court said that tribal immunity protected
against that.
And so -- so I do think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought that was just on
reservation.  You think that was off reservation as
well?
MR. KATYAL:  It is.  At page 167, Your
Honor, it says that the injunction was both on and off
reservation.  And then, in Kiowa, at page 754, this
Court made clear that that's how it read --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Kiowa was later, of course.
MR. KATYAL:  Of course, but I think that
Congress, in enacting IGRA in 1988, certainly was under
the same set of assumptions as this Court in 19 -- in
the Kiowa --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You think they read
Puyallup that closely?
MR. KATYAL:  I -- well, I think it's several
places in Puyallup, and certainly, that's what this
Court in Kiowa said.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see.
MR. KATYAL:  And I do think the text is the
best guide to what Congress wanted, and the text uses
"on Indian lands" 24 times.  And the reason for that,
the reason why there's not an absurdity, is twofold:
First, Congress, in IGRA, was reacting to this Court's
decision in Cabazon the year earlier, which had ousted
State court -- State regulatory jurisdiction entirely
from on-Indian-lands activity, so it changed the game
entirely.
Cabazon did nothing with respect to
off-Indian-lands activity. It left entirely intact all
the remedies we've been talking about, Justice Alito's
remedy about criminal sanctions --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You agree with that, that
they could -- the State could go in and arrest all the
customers that are gambling there?  Could it seize the
slot machines?
MR. KATYAL:  Well, it certainly could arrest
the customers, the employees, and so on.  And that's why
we would not operate this casino without a square
ruling.  It is shuttered, Justice Alito, right now,
because we need a square ruling that says this is
on-Indian-lands activity.  And we would like that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you don't
it -- You don't have a square ruling, so I want to make
clear, because both you and the Solicitor General have
suggested this as an option:  You think it is all right
for the State to go in and arrest every employee,
management -- you know, labor, who is participating in
this casino and subject them to criminal sanctions,
civil penalties and an injunction.  You have got no
problem with that?
MR. KATYAL:  We think that that's a
consequence of tribal immunity, that when you -- when
they are seeking relief qua tribe, that's a different
thing, and that's, I think, a standard principle --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You, as a tribe --
you, as a tribe, would have no objection to that action?
MR. KATYAL:  Well, Your Honor, I think, if
that sort of circumstance unfolded, we might say let's
try and figure out a different way to deal with that.
First, of course, the most primary way is the compact
itself, and many compacts, for example, have arbitration
clauses --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I know, you
could suggest different ways, and the State could tell
you -- you know, go fly a kite, we are prosecuting these
people.  And you'd have no objection to that?
MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely.  We are not here,
trying to say that we want to evade the law.  We want a
ruling -- a definitive ruling.  We believe, very
squarely, that this is on-Indian-lands activity.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  What about Ex
Parte Young?  Are you willing to waive the tribe's
sovereign immunity in an Ex Parte Young action?
Because, in your opposition to the complaint in this
case, you raised sovereign immunity as an objection to
the Ex Parte Young --
MR. KATYAL:  Sure.  Sure.  As part in the
district court, as part of ordinary -- as part of
ordinary litigation, we said that Ex Parte Young wasn't
applicable.  But we do think -- and our brief in
opposition says this, our merits brief says this, the
United States' brief says this, that Ex Parte Young
actions are available against tribes, just as --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not just are
available; that you would not assert sovereign immunity
if they brought an Ex Parte Young action.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, Your Honor, we would not
assert it to the limits of Ex Parte Young.  So, for
example, Ex Parte Young doesn't -- doesn't permit
reaching into the State coffers, and here, Count 5 of
the complaint tries to reach into the tribe's coffers.
So we do think that that type of Ex Parte Young -- that
is not permitted by Ex Parte Young, and that would be
impermissible.
If I could return to the second reason why I
think what Congress did wasn't -- wasn't -- you know,
creating any sort of anomaly like my friend says, the
reason is this:  All IGRA did in (A)(ii) is empower
compacts.  It didn't abrogate immunity by itself
directly; it requires the tribe to affirmatively buy
into the idea of State law applying on the reservation.
So if we could, just imagine a casino,
Justice Scalia, opened blatantly on a reservation, a
casino without a compact that was absolutely illegal.
We will call it "Casino Red."  (A)(ii) would not
abrogate immunity in that circumstance.  The State would
have no remedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought the statute says
that there is Federal court jurisdiction over any cause
of action initiated by a State or Indian tribe to enjoin
gaming activity that is conducted in violation of the
compact.
MR. KATYAL:  Yeah, on Indian lands, exactly.
And so my example of the casino here would be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why couldn't this --
MR. KATYAL:  If there is no compact,
Justice Kennedy, there is no abrogation.  And so what
(A)(ii) does is it empowers the tribe and the compact,
and it requires the tribe affirmatively to come in.  And
that's why, off Indian land, there is standard tribal
immunity because the tribe hasn't said anything one way
or the other.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you don't think that
1166 abrogates the immunity, which provides that, for
purposes of Federal law, all State laws are applicable?
MR. KATYAL:  Yeah, not at all, Your Honor.
All 1166 does is bring Federal -- that's about Federal
enforcement, not at all about State enforcement.
Indeed, Michigan's own position and Michigan's supreme
court said 1166 does says nothing with respect to
States --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you do not take the
position that this casino in this case is part of a
compact?
MR. KATYAL:  Which casino?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The casino in this case,
in your view, is not subject to any -- is not covered by
any compact?
MR. KATYAL:  No, we do.  We think that the
proper remedy here, if they had an objection, would have
been to arbitrate and say this is not Indian lands.
Petition Appendix 77A and 78A lay out the terms of the
compact and what gaming is allowed.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But he says that, if they
arbitrated, when they tried to enforce the arbitral
judgment, you would assert sovereign immunity.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, two responses to that,
Your Honor.  First, of course, that is the remedy they
agreed to in the compact itself, and, of course, they
should try.  And second --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I mean, that's not an
answer.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, it is an answer in the
sense that, Your Honor, had they asked we -- and I can
tell you I've discussed this with the tribe -- that they
would, of course, not -- they would, of course, not
assert sovereign immunity to enforce the arbitration
agreement.  We have --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you win in an
arbitration when the gaming commission has said it's not
Indian lands?  I mean, I actually am not sure that the
ruling of the district court was right on this, okay?
But putting my own beliefs -- or questions about that
ruling, how do you win if the Federal government has
said it's not Indian lands?
MR. KATYAL:  Well, we think that that isn't
a final decision and is wrong for any number of reasons
on the merits that -- you know, laid out in the Joint
Appendix, and so we do think that would be the argument
that we would make to the arbitration board.  That
should have been the remedy --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But how does the
arbitration board change the mind of the gaming
commission?  Aren't they the final deciders of whether
this is trust land or not?
MR. KATYAL:  Well -- no, I think that -- I
think that that isn't, itself, a final decision, and
there are any number of mechanisms that may be available
to try and get the issue properly teed up to the NIGC.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't see how an
arbitration works.  The Federal government has a very
keen interest in whether this is Indian land or not.
And the arbitrator is going to decide that in a way
that's going to bind anybody?
MR. KATYAL:  Well, it would bind, I think,
the parties before it, and that's what the parties
agreed to.  In many compacts --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So ongoing, as far
as the tribe and the State is concerned, they proceed
from then on as if this is Indian lands, even though the
Federal government is saying, no, it's not.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that we would
still have to persuade the Federal government in one
way, shape, or form because of the NIGC's authority in
this area, so I think that's two separate questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.  So the
arbitration doesn't get -- so the arbitration doesn't
get you anywhere at all.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, it at least resolves the
issue with respect to Michigan.  Our central point here
is that there's lots of different ways to deal with this
question, including the question you asked earlier, the
declaratory judgment action, which we brought against
Michigan.  There's lots of ways to resolve the
underlying Indian lands question.
The last thing I think this Court needs to
do is entirely change the rules of the game with respect
to tribal immunity.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just so we understand --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What would be the big --
what would be the big change, other than modifying
Kiowa, which is a divided opinion, and was dealing with
a money claim.  It wasn't dealing with injunctive
relief.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, certainly, this Court's
decision in Puyallup, as well as Oklahoma -- Oklahoma
Tax Commission, both did deal with injunctive relief,
and both were against States, to deal with his argument.
Now, he has said -- my friend on the other
side has said, we'll look to the foreign sovereign
immunity context, and that's what's giving him his
reason for saying that it wouldn't be such a big change,
and we think that's wrong for two reasons.
Number one, Kiowa itself, at page 759, dealt
with this and said that it was the political branches
that led the change on commercial immunity, not this
Court.  And, number two, my friend has quoted Alfred
Dunhill, and I think that everything --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But – Mr. Katyal, is that
right?  The distinction between commercial and
governmental, it was court made in the first instance,
and then the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act codified
law that was court made.  So it was the courts that made
the distinction between acting in a commercial capacity
and acting in a governmental capacity.
MR. KATYAL:  Justice Ginsburg, the majority
of Kiowa, on page 759, responds to that and says that it
was actually the political branches that led with the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but he was wrong on
that, apparently, if that's what he says.  He was wrong,
that, if we look at the cases, what we will see is it
was the courts that said there's a common law abrogation
of France's sovereign immunity, when they go into
business in downtown Iowa somewhere.
MR. KATYAL:  And Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER:  The same thing -- same
thing with the State, he says in Nevada and California,
and then he says it would be totally anomalous to think
that an Indian tribe could go into downtown Des Moines
and open up a clearly illegal business, and you could
sue France -- the State, which was not Kiowa -- they
could sue -- France could -- the State could sue France,
it could sue California, but it couldn't sue the Indian
tribe.
MR. KATYAL:  Justice Breyer, we would
encourage the Court to look at precisely the case he is
citing for this proposition, which is Alfred Dunhill,
because, as the case was vigorously argued by a Justice
Department attorney, and what -- and what my friend
doesn't tell you is that the pages he is citing actually
don't command a majority of the Court.
They're about not commercial -- they're not
about foreign sovereign immunity.  They are about active
State immunity.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  What about the
California and Nevada?
MR. KATYAL:  In the California v. Nevada, I
think this Court dealt with in Kiowa itself because in
Kiowa -- because that's about basically the State --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, Kiowa is about -- is
it Kiowa? -- is about individuals who are not the State.
MR. KATYAL:  Yes, exactly.  But I think this
Court has recognized in Blatchford and in Kiowa that, in
Nevada v. Hall situations, which is what the dissent in
Kiowa raised and what my friend is trying to
resuscitate, that's a difference in circumstance because
there was a mutuality of concession.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  I'll look at
those with care.  But, now, assuming you are right on
that, is the question in front of us, on the assumption
that these are Indian lands, does the Indian tribe have
sovereign immunity?  Is that the question you want
answered?
MR. KATYAL:  We think that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes or no?
MR. KATYAL:  -- that if they are on Indian
lands, yes, there is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you want us to say on
that assumption -- now, on that assumption, I look at i
and number ii under a, 7(a), and a quick reading of them
suggests to me that they're in parallel, that the Indian
tribe can sue the State when the State won't open
negotiations, and the State or an Indian tribe can sue
the Indian tribe when the Indian tribe refuses to follow
the compact.
Now, what's your answer to that?
MR. KATYAL:  When it's on Indian lands,
exactly.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I know, but you said
to decide this on the assumption that it's on Indian
lands.  If I make that assumption and then I look over
and read i and ii, it sounds as if, as I said, i, the
tribe can sue the State to get the compact; ii, the
State can sue the tribe when it violates the compact.
MR. KATYAL:  Your Honor, I may have
misunderstood your earlier question, but, certainly, our
position is that you can look to our answer to determine
whether or not there is tribal immunity in the case.
That is not something my friend has argued.  It's
outside of the questions presented entirely, which both
proceed on the assumption that this is off of Indian
lands.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, for purposes of
sovereign immunity, does it make any difference that you
have at least a colorable claim that this is on Indian
lands?
MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that it -- I -- I
don't think it matters either way.  Our position is one
way or the other.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  So if your -- if your
client or another tribe just decided to go into the
gaming business all over the country and began opening
casinos in places that clearly are not Indian lands, you
still would have sovereign immunity.
MR. KATYAL:  Right, there would be tribal
immunity for that, just as if the blatant casino on
Indian lands opened a casino -- a tribe opened a casino
without a compact, the State would not have an A2
injunctive remedy, and that's why there is no anomaly.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's why I want to -- I'm
trying to get what question I'm supposed to answer.  If
I'm supposed to answer the sovereign immunity question
on the assumption that these are Indian lands, contrary
to what was decided below, I might get one answer.  But
if I'm -- supposed to do it on the assumption that
they're not Indian lands, I might get a different
answer.  What assumption am I supposed to make?
MR. KATYAL:  The latter, Your Honor, for two
reasons.  Number one, that's what the questions
presented say; and number two, one of the most venerable
precedence of this Court is the -- is Justice Holmes'
opinion in Kohler Die -- which says you don't look to our answer to
determine --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What happens if you
can't convince the Federal government that these are
Indian lands, and despite the gaming commission's final
ruling, there is no other way to overturn it, you decide
to operate the casino, it's not Indian lands by the
Federal government, you haven't convinced them
otherwise, what occurs at that moment?
MR. KATYAL:  Well, I suppose --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Who can stop you and
using what mechanisms?
MR. KATYAL:  The Federal government has a
variety of mechanisms available to it in that
circumstance, including closure orders and the like, and
I suppose even the State may have any number of actions,
both -- you know, many States will have this worked out
in the compact, but, if they don't have it worked out in
the compact, then there may be the possibility of
criminal prosecutions.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the compact only
comes into play if it's Indian lands.  But, if the
Federal government has said it's not Indian lands,
that's what I'm asking.
MR. KATYAL:  Right.  I think that, still,
the State may have any number of criminal or civil
remedies available to it.  That is, off Indian lands --
and this is why there isn't an anomaly in A2 -- off
Indian lands, the State has vast regulatory power.  IGRA
was reacting to a circumstance in which this Court
ousted State regulatory jurisdiction on Indian lands.
And so the State has a whole bunch of mechanisms
available to it.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Katyal, isn’t the
difference -- the State can really -- it can shut down
these gambling operations easily if it's off Indian
lands.  What the State can't do is get any kind of
damages or money remedies; isn't that really the
difference?
MR. KATYAL:  I do think so.  I think that
that's -- I think that that's underlying some of this,
absolutely.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Maybe that's an important
difference.  I mean, maybe we should give the State the
ability to collect damages.
MR. KATYAL:  Well -- well, I certainly would
disagree with the idea that you, the Court, should.  I
think the proper response would be exactly what this
Court said in Kiowa, which is, if there's a dispute
about the contours of immunity, commercial, off land,
State is plaintiff, all of that, those are all things
that Congress is well-suited for dealing with.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Katyal, isn't it odd
to say that when this is the Court -- the doctrine of
tribal immunity is something that was announced by this
Court.  Congress never passed a law that said the tribes
have immunity.  It's all this Court.  And then you say,
what this Court made, only Congress can unmake.  That
seems strange to me.
MR. KATYAL:  Justice Ginsburg, that was
precisely the argument that was made in Kiowa, was
accepted by the dissent in Kiowa.  But what the majority
said is, really, Congress is best able to balance the
rights, remedies, and reliance interests on the parties.
And I'd note, picking up on your question to my friend
earlier, that, after Kiowa, Congress hasn't been silent.
Congress has reaffirmed tribal immunity in
the Patriot Act extension in 2005 and the SIGR Act of
2009.  They've cut it back in the Arizona Water Act and
the Zuni Acts of 2003.  This is not a circumstance in
which --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, if the tribe takes
such an obscure position -- such a changing position, as
to whether or not we are dealing with Federal lands
here -- or pardon me, with Indian land, maybe that's a
reason that we should confine and limit Kiowa so that it
doesn't apply to Indian gaming, and we won't have this
problem.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because I wanted to get
the answer to Justice Breyer's question, is it your
position that these are Indian lands?  And I still don't
understand your position.
MR. KATYAL:  Our position is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if that's true, then
maybe this whole idea of immunity doesn't work very well
in the context of gaming.
MR. KATYAL:  Our position, Justice Kennedy,
is that they are Indian lands, and there is lots of
different remedies available, both on and off Indian
lands, and that this Court in Kiowa set out a way to
deal with any sort of cutting back, which is to leave it
to Congress.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What remedy --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If we get -- go
ahead.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What remedy would a private
person have?  Suppose a patron of a casino was beaten up
by casino employees.  What remedy could that person
have?
MR. KATYAL:  I think what the Court should
do is the same thing it did in Kiowa, which is bracket
that question because this is as far away from that as
you can possibly get.  Here, the State entered into a
contract with its eyes open that, not just -- it didn't
say anything about tribal immunity, it reaffirmed tribal
immunity, at Petition Appendix Page 90.
Now, Michigan doesn't like the terms of that
deal, and so they are coming and trying to renegotiate
that now, So there may be -- for the tort plaintiff, I
understand there may be any number of arguments
available, but this is so far from that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We've talked about
this prosecuting the employees.  I suppose, if you bring
a criminal action against one of the employees, the
State would have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt,
that this was not Indian lands?
MR. KATYAL:  They would.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's not much of
a --
MR. KATYAL:  I'm not sure, for an element of
that crime, whether that piece of it would be beyond a
reasonable doubt.  It would be an attendant circumstance
and not subject to beyond reasonable doubt.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That makes it a much
more difficult remedy than the typical injunction
action.
MR. KATYAL:  But there is still civil
remedies and other things going.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Not yet.  We are going to hear from
Mr. Kneedler first.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He might have
something you would like to respond to.
Mr. Kneedler.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING the RESPONDENTS
MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court:
I would like to respond, at the outset, to the
suggestion that this Court might modify the categorical
rule in Kiowa that an Indian tribe is subject to suit
only if Congress unequivocally consents in order to
allow suits by States.
First of all, both Puyallup and Pottawatomi
were suits by States for prospective injunctive relief,
and the Court found them barred.  Puyallup was off
reservation.
But there's another point that I think ties
in with the questions about foreign sovereign immunity.
In this Court's decision in Blatchford, the Court held
that the State of Alaska could not be sued by an Indian
tribe complaining about the distribution of State --
some State funds in Alaska, which does not have Indian
country.  The Court held that the suit was barred.
In doing so, the Court recognized that the
Eleventh Amendment had originally been understood to bar
suits only by individuals.  But relying on this Court's
decision in Principality of Monaco, the Court said that
the Eleventh Amendment also barred suits by foreign
sovereigns.
And the Court's rationale in Principality of
Monaco was that foreign sovereigns were not parties to
the convention.  There was no reciprocal abrogation of
immunity between foreign sovereigns and States.  And, in
fact, the Court specifically pointed out that the State
of Mississippi could not sue Monaco, and, in this case,
Monaco could not sue Mississippi.
The Court applied that very same reasoning
in Blatchford to an Indian tribe.  The Court said, we
have held in the past that Indian tribes may not be
sued.  And they cited Puyallup, which was a suit by a
State.  And the Court said, logically, it follows that a
tribe may not sue a State --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So you are prepared to live
with the following:  Is it the case that if California
opens a business in a commercial activity in 20 other
States, at least one of which it is totally illegal,
this other State, say, Utah, cannot -- can sue
California or not?  What's the answer?
MR. KNEEDLER:  The State where that gaming
occurs can be, but that's because of Nevada v. Hall
where the Court -- where the Court drew a distinction
between -- for States.  In the States there was a  --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So what the opposition
says, in your view, is absolutely correct, that a
foreign nation opens up an illegal business in a State.
The State can sue them, now, because of a treaty, but
previously, because of the common law.
If California opens up an illegal business,
the State can put them out of business by bringing a
suit.  But an Indian tribe, they can't?  That's the
United States' view?
MR. KNEEDLER:  California -- in the
State-to-State situation, it's because of the
reciprocity --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But I'm saying that is your
view, though?  I just want the bottom line.
MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, but let me -- if I may
explain?  It's important to understand the
reasoning.  The reasoning why a suit by a State against
the sovereign would now be okay is because of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  As I mentioned with
the Principality of Monaco, part of what the Court said
there is the State could not sue the Principality of
Monaco because, at the time, there was no abrogation of
immunity.
Foreign sovereign immunity --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that statute was
based upon judicial decisions that had -- had already
held that.
MR. KNEEDLER:  With all respect,
Justice Scalia, it was based upon the Executive Branch's
determination in the Tate letter.  In this Court's
decision in Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman.  The Court
said it is not for the Courts to deny an immunity that
the government recognizes.
Prior to 1952, when the United States
adopted the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity,
foreign sovereigns were absolutely immune from suit,
unless the political branches said otherwise.
In the Tate letter, the Executive Branch
adopted what was the developing body of international
law for foreign sovereign immunity and said that
commercial activities could be the subject of suit.
That was codified, but the Court did not take it upon
itself to modify that foreign sovereign immunity.  And
this is -- this is the point that the Court made in Kiowa.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Took it upon itself to
accept the Executive's determination of how it ought to
play out?
MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, yes, but it didn't
treat it just as a matter of common law, like a maritime
common law claim or something like that.  It treated it
as structural under the Constitution, and the same thing
is true of Indian tribes.
The Constitution refers to Indian tribes --
Worcester v. Georgia announced that Indian tribes are
sovereigns.  We’ve made treaties with sovereigns.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But they are
quasi -- quasi-sovereigns, which means --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Dependent sovereigns.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Dependent
sovereigns, which means the -- it is surprising that the
scope of their immunity exceeds that of States or
foreign sovereigns.
MR. KNEEDLER:  They -- they are dependent
sovereigns, but they are dependent upon the plenary
power of Congress, not the plenary power of this Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the -- so the
Federal government can certainly take enforcement action
against this casino.
MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The Federal
government, the Solicitor of Interior has said these are
not Indian lands, the NIGC has adopted that
interpretation.  The NIGC has said, but we can't do
anything because they are not Indian lands, and we work
on Indian lands.  And then they've referred, as I
understand, the matter to the United States Attorney who
has, thus far, not done anything, right?
MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, basically, as I
see it, the Federal government is saying, States, you
can't take action against this illegal casino.  We're
the only ones who can.  We agree that it's illegal, but
we are not going to do anything.
MR. KNEEDLER:  We are -- first of all, by --
the casino was promptly closed.  And whether it would
have been a prudent exercise of Federal criminal
prosecutorial authority or civil action under 1955, is
committed to the ordinary prosecutorial discretion of
the United States government.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Who made these Indian tribe
sovereign?  Was it Congress?
MR. KNEEDLER:  The Constitution.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, you are appealing
to -- you know, other branches' determination.  Who
decided that Indian tribes are sovereign?
MR. KNEEDLER:  The Constitution by in the Commerce clause --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Who pronounced them to be
sovereign?
MR. KNEEDLER:  This -- this Court.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  This Court.
MR. KNEEDLER:  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So I assume that this Court
could also determine the scope of their sovereignty.
MR. KNEEDLER:  But this Court didn't do it
as a matter of common law.  It did it by looking at the
Constitution.  We have treaties with Indian tribes, we
have the Commerce Clause --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We do virtually nothing as
a matter of common law.  We do virtually everything on
the basis of the Constitution or statutes.  I don't
think that that's much of an exception.
MR. KNEEDLER:  As this Court said in Lara,
it's a general proposition that diminishment of tribal
sovereignty is for the political branches.  The Court
said that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  Because you are
representing the United States.  You have -- you
understand Indian policy.  This case has tremendous
implications, if we follow your approach.  It seems to
me well beyond anything to do with gaming.  My belief is
Indian tribes all over the country operate businesses
off the reservation, and businesses all over the country
are regulated.
And does the State, I guess, in your view,
does not have the power to enforce the regulation
against the Indian tribe.
MR. KNEEDLER:  Not against --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is that -- not against
the tribe itself.  Why is that in the Indian tribe's
interest?  And is it a trap for the unwary lawyer?  And
how is this supposed to work out, in your view?
MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, Congress has addressed
this problem in numerous ways.  For example, the -- and
in deciding whether to abrogate immunity, they're
complex decisions.  Should it be under tribal law?
Should it be under State law?  Should it be under
Federal law?  Should the suit be in Federal court?
Should it be in State court?
JUSTICE ALITO:  What about -- what about
private individuals who may have a claim against -- as a
result of the operation of the casino?  Vendors who want
to be paid, somebody who slips and falls.  That's all
barred by sovereign immunity?
MR. KNEEDLER:  Unless -- unless the tribe
consents.  As the -- as two of the amicus briefs point
out, a number of the tribal compacts provide for waivers
of sovereign immunity for tort claims that may arise out
of -- out of the gaming operation.
Contract claims could be -- could be brought
in tribal court --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Justice Alito's question
was the Kiowa case.  It was off reservation, the tribe
owed money on a contract, which it refused to pay, and
the Court said sovereign immunity.
MR. KNEEDLER:  Exactly.  And I should also
point out that the Court said in Kiowa, in addition to
reaffirming this analysis that I described from
Blatchford and Coeur d'Alene Tribe v. Idaho, the Court
reaffirmed that reciprocity and Principality of Monaco
point.
But it also pointed out the tremendous
reliance interests that have grown up on -- the basis of
foreign sovereign immunity.  It pointed out that, for
example, 450n of Title 25, which specifically preserves
immunity, something that was reiterated in the No Child
Left Behind Act.
But it also specifically pointed out that
Congress has sometimes created narrow exceptions to the
immunity.  And critically, one of the ones it cited was
the very one on which Michigan is relying in this case,
2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), that is a limited exception for
injunctive actions by a State against a tribe.  Congress
addressed --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kneedler, you went
through the development of the foreign sovereign
immunity and whether the courts were influenced by the
government.  It was the courts that recognized this
distinction between commercial activity and governmental
activity.
Why couldn't the Court extend that same
distinction to Indian tribes and say, it makes sense in
the foreign country context, it also makes sense in the
context of the tribes, to distinguish commercial from
governmental?
MR. KNEEDLER:  It may well not make sense,
or it may not lend itself to one answer, for the reasons
that I said.  Congress, for example, when it comes to
tort claims against tribes, adopted a provision making
the United States liable for tort claims and not -- and
not others.
It may not lend itself to one principal
answer, which is why the Court, in Kiowa, said it's up
to the legislature, the Congress, to weigh the various
pros and cons or up to the tribe itself in deciding
whether to weigh it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
Mr. Kneedler.
Mr. Bursch, you have five minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I want to clarify just two things about the
Court's precedent and then get back to the remedies
issue, which has taken up so much of our time this
morning.
First, the state of the law, when IGRA was
adopted in 1988 -- again, that was before Kiowa, I heard
my friend on the other side talk about Puyallup and how
that was an off-reservation case.  And what you need to
understand was that Puyallup was the third in a series
of three opinions that this Court issued.  And it's true
that some of the earlier cases involved on- and
off-reservation conduct.
But as we point out in our reply brief --
this is at pages 167 to 68 of that opinion -- here, the
tribe's contention was that the fishing activities on
its reservation were immune, and Justice Stevens wrote
that opinion, and then, only a few short years later, in
Kiowa, wrote his dissent, where he said we've never
before drawn that on/off-reservation distinction.  So
that's what Puyallup says.
With respect to Alfred Dunhill and the
evolution of foreign sovereign immunity as a common law
doctrine, four Justices agreed -- or signed on to the
entire opinion where that discussion was held.
One Justice agreed only with parts one and
two, but part two, on page 694, draws the commercial
line and says the problem here is that the district
court found the only evidence of an active state, as
opposed to a commercial act, was a statement by counsel
that the Cuban government and the intervenors denied
liability, and that's not enough.
And -- and the Court did reference the Tate
letter, but that's not why the Court changed the common
law of foreign nation sovereign immunity.  It -- it gave
respectful consideration to the Executive Branch's
views, and then it reached its own conclusion about what
the common law should say.
And, Justice Ginsburg, you are exactly right
to say, if it makes sense in the foreign nation context
and it makes sense here, apply it to both.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If we modified it to make
an exception for commercial activities off reservation,
could Congress reinstitute sovereign immunity if they
wanted?
MR. BURSCH:  No question they could.  Just
like when this Court in Cabazon said that States didn't
have the regulatory authority they thought they did to
regulate illegal gaming on reservation, and this Court
said -- you know, States can't really touch that.
Congress immediately jumped in and corrected course.
You know, conversely, with Alfred Dunhill,
when this Court drew the line at commercial conduct,
Congress immediately jumped in.  And it put its stamp of
approval on that, and essentially adopted the line --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, there seems something
sort of strange about that, General, because as I read
Kiowa, what it was, was an invitation to Congress.  It
was saying -- you know, we have some concerns about
this, we're not sure it makes sense, we are dropping a
very broad hint that Congress should change it.
And, 15 years later, Congress has done
nothing.  And then to come back 15 years later and to
say -- you know, Congress didn't really accept our hint,
so we'll just do it ourselves and make Congress reverse
it.  Wouldn't you think that that's a strange procedure
to use?
MR. BURSCH:  Actually, Justice Kagan, I
think that's the way that the common law works, that the
Court does extend invitations to the Legislative And
Executive Branches.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe we've learned
something in 15 years, such as the fact that --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Maybe we learned that Congress thought
that this did make sense.
MR. BURSCH:  I think you could draw the
conclusion either way.  And the suggestion by the tribe
and the government that somehow this Court lacks the
power to define common law tribal immunity, we think,
doesn't hold water.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I would have thought,
General Bursch, that one of the principles behind Indian
law in this country goes something like this:  Congress
can do pretty much whatever it wants with respect to
Indian tribes, but we will not likely assume that
Congress means to undermine tribal sovereignty.  We
will -- we will insist that Congress says that before we
put it into effect.
And, here, it's not just -- I mean, Congress
has given every indication that it does not wish to
change this, notwithstanding our hints that it should.
MR. BURSCH:  I respectfully disagree.  And
the best evidence of that congressional intent is in
IGRA itself, where Congress abrogated immunity, even for
on-reservation conduct.
Think about what an extraordinary remedy
that is, that, even on the reservation, a State would
have the ability to go into court and get a Federal
injunction, rather than send in police to arrest --
JUSTICE BREYER:  He's adding one thing,
which is, as you've just heard, that the Indian tribes
are in the same Eleventh Amendment type position as the
Principality of Monaco before the treaty.
MR. BURSCH:  Right, but --
JUSTICE BREYER:  They didn't participate in
the convention and the Principality of Monaco was held
to be immune, presumably, even from commercial activity.
Let Congress change it.  That's what Kiowa says.  And
that, I think, is their basic argument.
And if it's a wash -- I mean, I hate to put
it this way because it sounds like a joke, but it isn't
meant to be -- in this case, if it's a wash, follow the
precedent.
MR. BURSCH:  I think Alfred Dunhill makes
clear that this Court can change the stream of the
common law when it comes to -- to immunity.
Really quickly on -- on these remedies --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then go back to the
beginning question.  You have remedies you don't like,
but the waiver under IGRA is not for damages.  It's only
for injunctive relief.  You have that in Ex Parte Young.
Why are you asking us to waive sovereign immunity with
respect to damages?
MR. BURSCH:  I'll explain why, if I may
answer the question.  With respect to arresting, Ex
Parte Young remedies, enforcing the arbitration and
having them waive immunity, all these things are unclear
whether they're available to us.  And if this Court
issued a definitive opinion that said, we have each one
of those remedies, that would do great good in this
area.
But the reason why we think that you should
go farther than that is because, if sovereignty means
anything, it means allowing people to define what is
illegal on their own lands, whether it's prostitution,
gaming, or underage drinking, and being able to use the
full enforcement power of the sovereign State, civil and
criminal, to enforce those laws.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the
