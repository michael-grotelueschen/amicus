CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 11-199, Vasquez v. United
States.
Mr. Brindley.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEAU B. BRINDLEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRINDLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
When determining whether an error affects
substantial rights pursuant to the harmless-error
statute, courts should first begin the analysis with the
error itself, consider it in the context of the entire
record, determine what potential impact it may have, and
then ask the question: Can the government prove to the
requisite degree of certitude -- in this case, fair
assurance -- that the error did not substantially impact
the verdict of the jury that heard the case?
It is impermissible for the reviewing court
to merely ask the question of whether some other jury, a
reasonable jury that didn't hear the error that this
jury heard, would convict him and determine harmlessness
on that basis.
Kotteakos --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: My problem --
MR. BRINDLEY: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is I can accept that
formulation certainly for purposes of this case. I just
don't see where in the opinion -- I have the opinion of
the court of appeals -- it focused on the wrong test.
It didn't use the magic words, and it
started out with let's look at the big picture, and it
said, well, here's the defense he elected to put on, and
this is a tough sell because. But then it quotes what
happens with the jury. It -- and it -- and it ends its
analysis for -- saying: We -- this evidence would have
moved the jury to convict Vasquez without a nudge from
anything it heard in the government's case.
I just -- I just don't see that you have
supported your theory by what the -- by what the court
says.
MR. BRINDLEY: Before the harmless-error
analysis, the question the Court asks is, what we have
to decide is whether a reasonable jury would convict him
absent the error. And so, the question that they ask
doesn't require any consideration of the error. And the
conclusion they reach that he would be convicted without
any consideration of the error also doesn't consider the
error.
They do not address the error or its impact
at all, despite a robust dissent, which set forth the
extraordinary prejudicial possible impact of this error.
They don't disagree with the dissent; they simply don't
address it at all.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what
the error actually was? I see -- and you can add
another -- three potential things about these calls or
three potential errors: One, that they proved as a
matter of fact that she was biased. But, as the
majority points out, she already said she was before the
tapes were played. So, whatever error may have been
occasioned by the jury using the tapes as for the truth,
it really was cumulative to an already admitted bias.
The second is some sort of ambiguous
statement by her that all of them were in trouble,
meaning all the defendants, and a similar statement by
the -- by Petitioner's lawyer. So, what was it that was
error that affected or influenced the jury among these
three choices?
MR. BRINDLEY: The -- the statements from
counsel, two statements: One, that everyone was going
to lose the case, which was repeated several times by
government counsel during the cross-examination of Ms.
Perez.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was never referenced
in the summations, however, or in the reply.
MR. BRINDLEY: They were not specific -- the
recordings were referenced, and they told them to look
at the recordings. They didn't reference that specific
statement. It was referenced three times in the
cross-examination. When the witness suggested that
it -- who was going to lose the case only referred to
her husband, the government corrected her and said, no,
it was everyone. And then they played the tape to make
that clear.
They also played a portion of a recording
where it said that counsel was talking to Mr. Vasquez
about pleading guilty. Now, if you take those two
statements together for their truth, what they mean is
that counsel believes he's guilty and was telling him he
should plead that way.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, that's the error
that you think --
MR. BRINDLEY: I think that's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- influenced this
trial?
MR. BRINDLEY: I think that's the most
substantial one.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Now, tell me
what in this record reflects that influence.
MR. BRINDLEY: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The fact that they asked
for her testimony -- well, she was your client's entire
defense. So, what does the asking for her testimony
show that they were interested in that particular part
of the transcript?
MR. BRINDLEY: Well, asking for her
testimony shows that they were focused on the -- they
were asking for a transcript that would have contained
that part of the record. We don't -- we can't prove,
and we don't have the burden -- I think that's
important -- to prove that she -- they were focused on
that specific statement. However, they did ask for that
transcript.
I also think they rendered the split verdict
in the case, which is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which transcript? The
transcript of her testimony?
MR. BRINDLEY: Her testimonies, both on
direct -- and then they asked for both, plural,
indicating they wanted the rebuttal testimony, which
would have included these statements.
And I don't think there's any way for the
government to prove on this record to any degree of
assurance that they weren't concerned about that error,
an error that I think if they took these things for
their truth, then they could have thought he essentially
confessed to his lawyer. His lawyer knew he was guilty.
Those are fair inferences if taken for their truth. And
then they could have disregarded all arguments that were
made on his behalf. That's a sort of error that could
infect the entire proceeding.
And when you ask --
JUSTICE ALITO: Is it correct that the
difference between your position and the Government's
position is that the Government says the focus should be
on a rational jury, and you say the focus should be on
this particular jury?
MR. BRINDLEY: That is one of the important
differences. I think --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that I understand.
But beyond that I really don't understand the difference
between the two positions.
MR. BRINDLEY: I -- well, in the
Government's brief, at some times, as we indicate in our
reply, it seems that they support a very similar test to
ours, and at others, it seems like they want to say that
you can just look at a reasonable jury and how they
would view the evidence.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me -- let me read
you two sentences and tell me whether you think there's
a difference between them.  First one: "Is there a fair
possibility that this particular evidence caused the
jury to convict?" Second statement: "Is there a fair
possibility that this jury would have" -- "that this
jury would have convicted without the evidence?"
Do you see a difference between those two?
MR. BRINDLEY: I do.
JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference?
MR. BRINDLEY: The difference is one of them
was going to focus on the entire record, which includes
the error. The other is going to focus on the evidence
in the record without the error, and that's important,
particularly with an error like this, an error that
could have a pernicious effect that could affect a
large, substantial part of this evidence, everything the
defendant presented. It’s really --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I --
MR. BRINDLEY: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- stop you there?
I -- where in the Government's brief do you
see the statement that the analysis should not look to
the error, should not include the error?
MR. BRINDLEY: Part of the Government's
brief asserts that you can look at whether a reasonable
jury would convict him absent the error. That
assessment doesn't require a consideration --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where --
MR. BRINDLEY: -- of the error.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where exactly is
that in their brief? That the -- the question is
whether a jury would convict him without considering the
error. Because I look at the Government's brief, and
they have fairly extensive analysis of -- of the error,
why they think it's not important, why they -- you know.
But I don't see them saying you don't look at the error
at all.
MR. BRINDLEY: I think there's a
significant -- I don't have the exact citation.
On page 29, Your Honor, it indicates:
"Although the Court's analysis often has not focused
exclusively on the overall strength of the government's
proof, its decisions demonstrate that a court's
determination of harmlessness can properly rest on the
conclusion that the admissible evidence of guilt is
sufficiently strong such that the prejudicial effect of
erroneously admitted evidence can be deemed not to have
altered the outcome."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, exactly. In
other words, you look at the prejudicial effect of the
erroneously admitted evidence and see if that altered
the outcome.
MR. BRINDLEY: If that's the -- and there's
parts of -- the Government's brief, I think, agrees with
us in large part on what this test should be. And as
far as that goes, I think the problem is the majority
below asked a different question and appeared to do a
different analysis.
JUSTICE KAGAN: What would you point at in
the majority opinion below that suggests that they did
an analysis that didn't look at the error and its
possible prejudicial effect?
MR. BRINDLEY: Two things: First, the
question that they asked. The question that they asked
was whether a reasonable jury would convict him absent
the error. There is no focus on this jury that heard
the case or this verdict. And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where -- where is that
statement? Where is that statement?
MR. BRINDLEY: In the -- you mean in the
majority opinion?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.
MR. BRINDLEY: It's immediately prior to the
harmless-error analysis.
If we go to page 16A of the appendix to our
cert petition, it states at the bottom of that first
paragraph: "On appeal, the burden lies on the
government to prove that a reasonable jury would have
reached the same verdict without the challenged
evidence."
That's the question they're asking. That
question doesn't --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but in the context
of the opinion -- and this was my first question -- they
then proceed to analyze -- and that's toward the very
end of its discussion -- what happened in this
particular case. And it concludes, from this evidence
we believe -- "This evidence we believe would have moved
the jury to convict."
MR. BRINDLEY: I think the problem is they
asked that question, which I think is the wrong
question. Kotteakos says you can't ask that question
because you can't strip the error from the whole.
That's the question they ask. And to answer that
question, you don't have to consider the error.
Then I think it's important they didn't
address the error at all; they didn't address its
potential impact, despite that dissent which laid out
that this is one of the most prejudicial errors you
could have in a trial. They ignored it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They say --
immediately after the sentence you gave us, they say
"looking at the evidence as a whole."
MR. BRINDLEY: They do say that. But then
later on, in that same paragraph, they indicate that
here's where the evidence was. And I think it's
important that the only evidence they talk about is the
government's evidence, and they talk about it in a way
that views the evidence in the light most favorable to
the government.
In their harmless-error analysis, they don't
address Mrs. Perez's testimony, and they -- the more
important thing is they don't address the error at all.
They don't even disagree with the dissent's contention
that it's this terribly prejudicial error.
Instead, they do what many of the courts
below have been doing when they do this guilt-based
approach to answer this question. They focus on the
government's evidence viewed in the light most favorable
to the government and then find, well, he could be
convicted on that basis by a reasonable jury.
JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't -- you didn't
read the whole thing. I -- it's a little hard to
understand. And looking at the transcript on page 769,
am I right? I want to get my own understanding right.
At that moment your client's lawyer, who they call
"Beau" -- is that right?
MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, that was me, Judge.
Yes, Your Honor, yes, it was me.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. All right.
Your client's lawyer, namely you --
(Laughter.)
MR. BRINDLEY: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- has not yet seen the
client; is that right? They think you haven't seen the
client yet. They say somewhere you haven't even talked
to him yet or -- he hasn't even talked to Beau. He
hasn't seen his lawyer yet. They say that two
paragraphs earlier.
So, is that right, basically, that they
think that, anyway? You see at the top of the page,
about six lines down: He hasn't even talked to the
lawyer yet. He hasn't even talked to Beau.
MR. BRINDLEY: I think that actually what
they're talking about was whether Mr. Perez's lawyer had
talked to me, Mr. Vasquez's lawyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, they're talking about
the lawyer. All right. And what you're trying to do,
as far as I can read this, is they think what you're
trying to do is you want Perez to plead guilty. Is that
the fair thrust of this?
MR. BRINDLEY: There's some discussion
between them --
JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think it means?
MR. BRINDLEY: There's -- it's hard for me
to tell exactly what --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, it's hard
to tell what they're talking about, I grant you that. I
thought they were talking about trying -- that you
thought it would be better if everybody got some kind of
agreement worked out.
And then she says, Perez's wife: "How can I
not worry?" He says: "I don't understand what's going
on." Which is fair comment. "But it's not the way
Beau -- he's putting it two different ways. If he
didn't explain to you the way, then, either -- then it's
a different story. If you don't ask him" --
Then she says: "Yes, he's saying that
everybody's going to lose. He's saying that whatever
he wants to say. I don't believe him."
Well, by the time I got through reading
that, I wasn't certain what they were talking about, and
I thought it sounded like they're talking about: Let's
all make an agreement or everybody's going to lose.
And -- and I could see that you could say
that's prejudicial. I could also see that the
government could say it isn't prejudicial. And it's
pretty hard for me to read their opinion as thinking
they were really not thinking about that error. I mean
that was -- or not an error. I mean, of course, they'd
be thinking about that; that was the issue.
And as I read the opinion, they
said, well, there's so much other evidence in the case,
and in our opinion, this is weak enough that it didn't
-- wouldn't have made a difference and -- and if you
didn't, say, take it for the truth.
And the other, dissenting judge, common, is
thinking: No, I don't know; you know, it's pretty hard
to understand what it means, but there's an implication
there the lawyer thinks he's guilty of some kind, and in
context that might have made a difference. So, he comes
to a different conclusion.
That's what I saw going on. And I didn't
see some big war of standards. I just saw judges
disagreeing about a fairly tough question in an
individual case. So, what can you say to make me change
my mind and think this is a war of standards that we
ought to --
MR. BRINDLEY: Well, because -- I think -- I
think the most important thing is what I've already
said, is the question they ask isn't about the error,
and they don't address it at all. And when you consider
a dissent with that robust of language, the idea that
they wouldn't address it at all is problematic.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, would it satisfy
you in your opinion if we said: We aren't finding your
opinion totally clear. And, luckily, people don't have
the right to send cases back to us on that basis, but we
have the right to send cases back to you on that basis.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: And, therefore, we would
like you to clarify whether you do or did or did not
take in the actual transcript page there, when you
reached your conclusion.
MR. BRINDLEY: I don't think that would be
sufficient, because I think the important thing here is
that they be required to ask the right question, to
focus on this jury that heard the case.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Brindley, I mean,
I guess one difficulty -- and this is really repeating
Justice Alito's question, but it seems that you're
parsing things pretty closely. If I ask the question
whether an error altered the verdict, it seems to me I'm
asking pretty much the same question as whether without
that verdict the -- whether without that error, the
verdict would be the same. That seems like just two
ways of saying the same thing.
Now, if what you're saying is put aside that
formulation, there are lots of courts that are doing
something wrong, which is that they're not looking at
the error and its possible prejudicial effect at all,
then I understand the argument; but then I ask the
question, well, is that what this court did?
MR. BRINDLEY: And I think that the -- by
asking the question in that way and talking only about a
reasonable jury absent the error, when you start saying
absent the error and you start looking at the evidence
without the error, you're looking at a case the jury
didn't hear. And I think that's the biggest problem.
If you're looking at a case the jury didn't hear, then
the reviewing court sort of makes its own guilt judgment
about a case they didn't hear.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, look, if you -- if you
win, your client will get a new trial. Let's suppose
that the new trial is exactly like the trial that took
place. Every single thing is the same except the error
is corrected. All right. Isn't that essentially the
harmless-error analysis?
MR. BRINDLEY: No, I don't think so.
JUSTICE ALITO: No?
MR. BRINDLEY: I don't think so, because I
think if you do the analysis that way and you say the
error is corrected, you don't take into account its
impact. The question has been to be whether it
contributed to the jury's verdict, not whether the
verdict would be the same in another trial. That's
where that Sixth Amendment problem that this Court was
worried about all the way back in Kotteakos, and even in
Neder, where this Court said to safeguard the jury's
province, we have to do an exacting review of the entire
record including -- that would include the error,
obviously, and its impact.
And here this court didn't address the error
or its potential impact, and I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you -- are you saying
that it doesn't matter that the verdict would have been
the same by this jury if the error had not been made?
You're --
MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, I am saying that. I'm
saying that the question --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that the test
is whether it contributed to the verdict, and if it did,
it doesn't matter whether the same verdict would have
been pronounced absent that evidence?
MR. BRINDLEY: That is correct, Your Honor,
yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, what is
harmless error? Every error is harmful. Every error
that's -- that's there contributes to the verdict.
There's no such thing as harmless error.
MR. BRINDLEY: I think -- I don't think that
should be the formulation of the test. I think it has
to have a -- what the government has to be able to do is
prove to the necessary degree of certitude that the
error doesn't substantially impact the verdict. And the
reason I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what does that
mean? To say that it doesn't substantially impact the
verdict means the verdict would have been the same
despite this evidence. But you're saying, no, that's
not the test; you have to ask whether it contributed to
the verdict. The Government says, well, it did, but the
verdict would have been the same anyway.
That's what harmless error is, it seems to
MR. BRINDLEY: I think what the -- when you
ask the question about whether the verdict contributed
substantially to -- or, I'm sorry, whether the error
contributed substantially to the verdict, what you're
doing is you're -- you have to then look at the entire
record and you have to look at the error's impact. And
when you do that, you can make a determination whether
there's anything in the record that would allow the
government to prove to the right degree of assurance
that it didn't.
Now, you could -- it could be the case that
you look at all of the evidence and you can say, well,
in light of all the other evidence, the error was
cumulative, or it was essentially uncontested. And then
you can find that error is harmless. It couldn't have
contributed to the verdict, and we know that to the
right degree of certitude.
I think the problem comes in when you're
talking about this reasonable jury and whether they
would convict without the error. That's some other
trial.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we get a little
more practical here? I think I understood your basic
argument, which is: My defense was by this one woman,
the wife of one of the codefendants. She tells a story,
and if the jury had believed her story they would have
acquitted your client.
MR. BRINDLEY: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, I am
assuming what you're saying -- and you can correct me if
I'm wrong -- which is if we believe that the error
committed affected her credibility in a meaningful way,
that that deprived you of a defense. Is that what
you're saying?
MR. BRINDLEY: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Of the potential of
convincing the jury.
MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, absolutely, in addition
to the fact that the error -- if those things are taken
for their truth, they serve as an independent basis for
conviction, believing he had essentially confessed.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. Now, assuming
that's your argument --
MR. BRINDLEY: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I go back to my
question. Okay? Because what you said to me earlier,
it wasn't about believing her or not; it was about
believing the defense attorney when -- whether the
defense attorney thought the defendant was guilty or
not.
MR. BRINDLEY: I think that -- well, I think
the two go hand in hand. I think that if they take these
statements for their truth, they could disbelieve her
and the defense attorney who called her because the
defense attorney knew he was guilty and then called this
witness to say otherwise. I think that would in that
situation make it appear as if she wasn't telling the
truth. And I think the important thing about this whole
analysis --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's -- let's --
MR. BRINDLEY: Okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -- are you
taking the position in this case that a reviewing court,
under no circumstance, could conclude that this error
was harmless? Or are you taking the position in this
case that the court here, the Seventh Circuit, I think,
committed review error and we should send it back for
them to do it the right way?
MR. BRINDLEY: I -- I am first saying that
the court committed review error. But I think -- I'm
also saying on top of that if you do the error -- review
properly in these cases, as we've asked the test to be
formulated, then what this -- this case is going to come
down to is really one question, and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you're -- and
you're agreeing with the dissenting judge, who I think
did say this error is harmful.
MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, of course.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so, you're not saying
that it's just that they didn't use the right formula,
but you would say, given what occurred here, the
importance of this witness, that -- that this was a --
this was a harmful error?
MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, absolutely. I -- I
think if you do the test appropriately and do the proper
analysis focused on this jury and the potential impact
of the error, then this is a harmful error.
JUSTICE BREYER: Back to Justice --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is your argument something
like this? Let's assume there are 10 pieces of
evidence. Evidence 1 through 9 are properly admitted.
Evidence item 10 is (a) wrongfully admitted and (b) so
prejudicial that that's all the jury looked at. There
is a substantial likelihood of that.
I think this is your argument: If the jury
was so obsessed, focused, transfixed by item 10, which
was improperly admitted, what would happen if we
concluded that this jury in this case on these facts, if
they had looked at 1 through 9, would have convicted?
What result?
MR. BRINDLEY: I think if you did the
examination that way and didn't consider 10 at all, what
you're saying is it's possible to convict on 1 through
, but you're not considering the possibility that you
could convict as an independent basis on 10. And the
government would have to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: We're not only saying it's
possible to convict, but that likely, probably would
have happened.
MR. BRINDLEY: I don't -- well, if the error
is the error in this case, that's number 10, then I
think when you consider the possible impact, sweeping as
it might be, I don't think there's any way on this
record that the government can prove with fair assurance
that that didn't infect the jury.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, my hypothetical is
that the court of appeals says that if the jury had
looked at 1 through 9, which was properly admitted
before them in this trial, they would have convicted,
likely.
Now, we -- then the hypothetical is: We
don't think they did because this item was so
prejudicial that all they looked -- that's all they
looked at. Is that what your argument is? It seems to
me that's stronger than the argument you're making. I'm
not sure even that works for you.
MR. BRINDLEY: I -- the formulation you've
stated, I agree with that. If number 10 is such that
there's no way that they can prove that it didn't impact
the jury's verdict substantially -- and I don't think
they can in this case -- then, yes, that's -- that's our
argument. And the one reason I think it's most
important in this case is because this case comes down
to -- at the end, we have -- you know, you have --
essentially it's a circumstantial case. This isn't like
Harrington or Schneble or the cases with direct evidence
where this Court has found harmless error.
This is a case where the ultimate question
is, if you believe Mrs. Perez is credible, he's not
guilty; if you don't, he is. And in order to find
harmlessness, you have to have a reviewing court on a
cold record making that credibility determination,
something that this Court has continually said a
reviewing court is not in a position to do. And when a
case can be ground down to the point where it's going to
come to a credibility determination about a witness the
reviewing court did not see --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe the majority in
the court of appeals was wrong in its application of the
harmless-error test. I didn’t think that was the reason
why we took this, why we took this case. What I'm
concerned about is the test. Now, the only aspect of --
the only thing that I understand that really
differentiates your position from the Government with
respect to the test is whether the focus is on a
rational jury or on this particular jury.
And when you say the focus should be on this
particular jury, aren't you calling for a speculation by
the -- by an appellate court? How is an appellate court
supposed to tell whether this particular jury was
different from a hypothetical rational jury?
MR. BRINDLEY: Because this -- the reviewing
court has to look at everything in the entire record.
That includes in this case the jury note. It includes
in this case the split verdict. All of those things.
And when you look at all of those things, you can get
insight into the jury that heard the case and how they
viewed it.
You can also look at how a reasonable jury
would view the case as heuristic device to get back to
what this jury thought. But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I thought
your main point -- yes, you said "this jury" rather than
a hypothetical jury. But I thought your main point is
that what's wrong is to say strip out the infected
testimony, take that out, look at the rest of the
record, and if the rest of the record warrants
conviction, no harmless error.
I thought that what you're saying is that
the basic mistake is what -- what are they looking to;
are they looking to all of the evidence, or are they
just asking the question, let's take out the tainted
evidence, see if there's enough to convict?
MR. BRINDLEY: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I
agree with that. The problem is the question asked by
the majority strips out the error and it also focuses on
the reasonable jury rather than this jury.
And with that, if there aren't any further
questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my
time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Brindley.
Mr. Yang.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The harmless-error inquiry, as this Court
explained in Neder and prior decisions, turns ultimately
on one question: Whether a rational jury -- and this is
a quote -- "whether a rational jury would have found the
defendant guilty absent the error." Now --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Yang, that does raise
the question that I think most separates you and Mr.
Brindley, and it's the question that Justice Alito
suggested. So, let me give you a hypothetical.
Let's say that this jury was not out for 8
hours but was out for 8 days. And on the 7th day, a
note came from the jury, and the note said we really
think that these tape recordings are extremely
important, but we're -- we're having a dispute about how
important they are, and we'd like to listen to them
again. And they do that, and then they come back with
this compromise verdict.
Now, what you are suggesting is that we
cannot look at any of that. Essentially, the best proof
that's available to us about whether the error in fact
affected this jury's decision, you would have a court
close its eyes to. And I guess -- why would that be?
MR. YANG: Well, I don't believe our view is
quite so firm. I think, as a general matter, our view
is that indications mid-deliberation of what a jury
might or some subset of the jury might be considering is
generally very unreliable. And that, in your case, the
Court shouldn't shut its eyes to that question, but what
it should do is redirect the court back to the evidence
that was before the jury. Because if we're assuming a
rational jury, there often is some correspondence; it
should be an indication to go back and look again.
If the Court were to conclude, wow, the
evidence was so overwhelming, so overwhelming that no
rational jury would have, you know, had a problem with
convicting absent the error, it's very unlikely that the
situation that your hypothetical poses would result.
So --
JUSTICE KAGAN: So, let me make sure I
understand what you're saying to me, that you're saying
to me: No, we didn't mean to say that that was
irrelevant; we just mean to say that an appellate court
should be cautious about it and look at that kind of
evidence in the -- in light of everything else that
happened at the trial.
MR. YANG: Ultimately, the appellate court
should look back at what the jury was supposed to
consider, the evidence in light of the instructions. It
should be a cautionary note but ultimately should
redirect the court back to the evidence.
And I think that focuses on, again, one of
the two related legal points that Petitioner made in
argument that I think there's real disagreement between
the Government and Petitioner on: one, the inquiry of a
reasonable jury or a rational jury, which is the
Government's view, versus this particular jury; and the
related claim that the inquiry is how this influenced
the deliberative process, if it was like a factor that
this jury might have considered in reaching its
verdict --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know how to
separate out an admitted error situation. And let me
explain why, okay? Let's assume the facts of this case,
but instead of this tape recording, the improperly
admitted evidence was a confession by the defendant.
Would you be prepared to say that in a circumstantial
case of guilt -- now, we've already said that
confessions are one of the most powerful pieces of
harmful error -- that in this, in a confession, that
somehow this was still harmful -- harmless?
MR. YANG: Are we taking Marina's testimony
out now?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. Yes.
MR. YANG: Okay. If Marina's testimony was
not in and you had the evidence here -- now, an
unconstitutional confession, of course, would raise the
bar, right?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a different
standard.
MR. YANG: We're going to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's -- let's talk
about it under the Kehota standard. Let's talk about
the standard we're assessing.
MR. YANG: If you're -- all you're asking is
a fair assurance, then I think you could get to the same
result here, because what you -- when you take Marina's
testimony out of the picture, there was really no
defense at all. What the government had was a strong
case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. He
testifies, but he testifies to everything Marina said.
Meaning, he -- when I used the word "confession," I'm
sorry, I misspoke.
He takes the stand. He -- or doesn't take
the stand. He says everything he said to the police.
And that confession that he was there, et cetera --
MR. YANG: So, he testified to the substance
of Marina's testimony, that he happened to just drive
there?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: She called him --
MR. YANG: Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- et cetera.
MR. YANG: And then the error is the same
error?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was improperly
admitted. Without Miranda --
MR. YANG: The tapes were --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- Miranda warnings.
MR. YANG: The tapes?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh. Not the tapes,
just the story.
MR. YANG: I'm a little confused --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.
MR. YANG: -- because if he's testifying in
court, the government is not putting him on. He's going
on as -- there's no Miranda question or anything.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My hypothetical is not
working for this reason, and I understand what you're
saying. It's hard to identify a comparable mistake.
But my point is that -- doesn't the harmfulness of the
error sort of vary with the strength of the government's
case?
MR. YANG: Undoubtedly. I think that's right.
Now, let --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If he had not run away,
and the tapes were admitted --
MR. YANG: We would have a weaker case, and
it would be -- ultimately, these lines that the Court
has to draw between a fair assurance or harmless beyond
a reasonable doubt are guides to reasoned judgment by
the court of appeals. The Court has repeatedly
recognized that this is a reviewing court's judgment
based on the record.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.
MR. YANG: Now -- now --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what the defense
said was there's only one defense here, and it's the
wife's defense that he was there by accident, not
intentionally. There was a lot of countervailing
evidence to disprove that, but the question is could a
reasonable jury have -- might have or could have
credited that defense?
MR. YANG: Well, I'm not sure that that's
Petitioner's view. I mean, I would -- there's two
aspects to this case. We can talk about the fact-bound
ins and outs of that, which is interesting in its own
right. But I think one of the key legal questions for
the Court is what's the standard that the Court must
apply. And there's a real difference between
Petitioner's and the Government here.
And that standard the Petitioner has
advocated is that this jury, as opposed to the
reasonable jury, and that looking at this jury, you must
look at the thought process of this jury to decide
whether the error might have had some influence.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, you look at how the
case was tried.
MR. YANG: Well, no, I think the position
about this jury versus a rational jury, in looking at
the deliberative process, is entirely foreclosed by this
Court's decision in Shinseki.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Yang --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you just told me it
wasn't, Mr. Yang. Because -- well, I think that the --
that the reason why this jury versus a reasonable jury
is important is whether you're going to take into
account what you know about what this jury did: how
long it stayed out, what notes it wrote to the court,
what eventual verdict it reached.
And you just suggested to me that that was
fair game to consider in this analysis, although one
should be cautious about doing it.
MR. YANG: I should qualify that. I didn't
intend to give the Court the misconception that we're
looking at this jury. The ultimate question is whether
a rational jury would have convicted absent the error.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, a rational jury is not
the jury that I said stayed out for 8 days and sent back
a note on the 7th day. That's this jury.
MR. YANG: And the reason that I believe
that the Court can use that as a benchmark to look back
at the evidence is it is some indication of perhaps what
the evidence should be saying to a rational jury. But
the ultimate question is the rational jury.
And let me give you a few examples from the
Court's case law, because I think this really puts it
beyond dispute that the real question is the question of
a rational jury, what they would do absent the error.
First, in Neder the Court explained that
erroneous admissions of evidence or exclusions of
evidence, just like an erroneous instruction on an
element of the offense, or failure to instruct on a
necessary element of the offense as was the case in
Neder, will infringe on the jury's factfinding role and
will affect the deliberative process in ways that are
not readily calculable.
The error in Neder was that the jury was
instructed not to consider the question of materiality,
which was an essential element of the defense. And the
Court specifically rejected that the -- that the fact
that this jury didn't actually make a finding based on
the evidence was not -- did not foreclose harmless-error
analysis.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're going back then to
your position in your brief where you said that you
would not include, in the harmless-error calculus, that
the jury requested to hear Marina's testimony again, the
length of their deliberations, the divided verdict? You
said in your brief, at pages 32 to 35, that you would
not include those.
MR. YANG: That's right. Those types of
indications are entirely unreliable and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought you
answered Justice Kagan that you could take them into
account, the court could take them into account but
cautiously, not give them -- not give them undue weight.
MR. YANG: What I think the court should do
is when you have a -- what is a much better indication
or at least a -- of what this jury might have been
doing, you use that as a reason to go back and look
again at the evidence.
JUSTICE BREYER: I suspect --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you have a case in
which, after the verdict of guilty, there's a motion for
a new trial, and it's being heard by the trial judge,
and the trial judge said: I now acknowledge that this
court committed error in introducing item 10 in
evidence. And the court remembers that when this came
into evidence, the courtroom was quiet, the jury was
transfixed, jurors were weeping. This was the high
point of the trial.
That's wrong for the judge to say. All he
has to say is, well, I have to ask whether items 9 -- 1
through 9 would have been in, and some other jury, a
rational jury -- so, that's the end of it. Judges do
the -- do what I suggested all the time.
MR. YANG: Well, we think that, again, the
-- the inquiry that needs to be focused on is what a
rational jury would do. And let me give you an
example --
JUSTICE KAGAN: That's starting to look, Mr.
Yang, very much like a directed verdict for the
government on the part of a judge, because you're so
abstracting it from this case and this jury and what
this jury's reactions to everything that happened was
that, you know, why not just go to the directed verdict
route?
MR. YANG: This Court has repeatedly
rejected that. The reason it's not a directed verdict
is you have a jury verdict. You have a jury verdict
that beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury has factually
determined that this defendant is guilty of the offense
charged, on proper instructions. Then the question is:
What remedy do you have?
JUSTICE KAGAN: You do have a jury -- excuse
me. You do have a jury verdict, but you are giving us a
formulation of the test that essentially pretends that
the jury is not there and that we know nothing about how
it reacted to various things.
MR. YANG: The reason --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Sorry. A question mark.
(Laughter.)
MR. YANG: This I think can be answered if I
could just get out a few of the Court's cases, because I
think this shows the Court's rationale here and shows
that our view has to be the right view.
For instance, in a series of cases, this
Court has concluded that the unconstitutional admission
of a confession, either of the defendant or the
codefendant, can be harmless when there is overwhelming
evidence such that a rational jury would convict without
the evidence.
Now, if we're looking at what a jury would
have considered, whether they were brought to tears or
whatever, when you're talking about a confession,
there's no doubt that a rational jury or any jury is
going to have that far in the forefront of their minds
when they are deciding guilt or innocence. But the
question --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I just don't
see how you can do it without the error. I keep going
back to this point. How about if the prosecutor had
done in summation the following: Ladies and Gentlemen,
whatever the wife told you disbelieve because the lawyer
said he was guilty.
MR. YANG: I'm sorry. I just --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The lawyer -- the
prosecutor got up at the end of trial and said:
Disbelieve everything the wife told you, because the
lawyer said the defendant was guilty. All right? I'll
go through all the other evidence I have that might
prove that she was not telling the truth, but the
central, most important piece of evidence in this case
about his guilt is that the lawyer said he's guilty.
Can you say that this jury was uninfluenced
by that error?
MR. YANG: No.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because under your
formulation --
MR. YANG: No. You can't --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- a rational jury would
have convicted absent the lawyer saying that.
MR. YANG: That's right. But this Court has
repeatedly said, for instance in Rose, where the
question was the jury was told to presume certain malice
in a -- in a homicide, the fact that the error may have
altered the basis on which the jury decided the case is
not the question; you look to the reasonable juror.
Similarly in Pope, the Court said the
question does not turn on whether the jury did not, in
fact, have this error in mind when it found the
defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, because --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would -- you would
take into account that the prosecution apparently
thought this was important, so important. The trial was
over. The prosecutor said: Judge, I'd like to come
back so these tapes can be introduced.
That -- the -- we have the witness
testifying that defendant is there by chance; he was not
part of the scheme. We have no direct evidence, because
Cruz never spoke to this defendant, to Vasquez. He's at
the scene, we know that. And an explanation, an
innocent explanation, is given why he's at the scene.
And then the government comes back, after everything is
done, and says: We want the jury -- we want these tapes
to be before the jury.
Isn't that -- don't we take into account
that the government itself thought this was very
important?
MR. YANG: I -- I think it's a factor that
you consider, again, in directing the courts look at
really what the trial evidence was. I mean it, I think,
belies the facts of this case -- obviously, that's a
hypothetical. But when you look at how cases really
develop, prosecutors don't focus on a fleeting, you
know, sentence in a series of -- series of long tapes
that weren't transcribed --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But my point to you is it
wasn't fleeting if the government says we want to extend
the trial so that we can play these tapes, all of them.
And they contain not just the one statement. There's
the one statement that the trial will be bad, a trial
will be bad for all of them, and they all -- that --
they should take a blind plea.
MR. YANG: I think when you look at what
happened at trial, you see that the tapes were played
for two reasons: one, to show that Marina had bias
because she was told by Petitioner's counsel that
Petitioner's counsel -- well, she thought this --
Petitioner's counsel would be able to make motions and
arguments on behalf of her husband at sentencing.
And --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The dissent pointed out
that she admitted that before the tapes were played.
MR. YANG: Correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That she was testifying
in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence for her
husband. So, she -- the tapes weren't necessary for
that.
MR. YANG: Well, the tapes certainly were
reinforcing of that. And, in fact, when the
government's closing argument -- it did not reference
anything about this -- what I think you and
Justice Breyer correctly identified as a very ambiguous
sentence in a series of long tapes. And, remember,
these --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was --
MR. YANG: -- the transcripts that are in the
record are only one portion of the tapes. So --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What was your second --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the line that
the government, the prosecutor, repeated three times
while she was on the stand, the exact line?
MR. YANG: The exact lines?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. YANG: This is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government thought --
thought it was important for the jury to hear it,
because they said it three times.
MR. YANG: Well, to be fair, I think you
need to look at what's before and after it. The
government is focusing on three different statements
that are at issue in the case.
The first one is that -- with some
profanity, suggesting that her husband is not likely to
succeed at trial. The second one is that defense
counsel suggested -- that she said that defense counsel
suggested that everybody was going to lose. And then,
third, she thought everybody was in, again with
profanity -- I'm going to paraphrase -- a bad situation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Yang, why does any of
this have to do with her credibility? Did the dissent
say that the way this affected the jury was that it
rendered her less credible? I thought --
MR. YANG: The --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the dissent just
said it's bad to tell the jury that even the defendant
thought he was guilty -- or even the defendant's lawyer
thought he was going to lose.
MR. YANG: The reason that this was in --
and I don't -- it's not contested here -- is because the
argument was made that these statements equating
Petitioner and Perez in terms of their level of guilt or
their likelihood of being convicted is inconsistent with
Marina's subsequent testimony that all of us -- you
know, Vasquez just -- or Petitioner just showed up
unknowingly because she asked him. That was the theory.
It's not contested. And, in fact, nothing
that the jury heard in this case under Petitioner's
theory would be different. The only difference would be
a limiting instruction that would simply say you can't
take these statements for the truth of the matter.
So, nothing that the jury heard would have
been different. When you read the short passage in the
context of these tapes -- and the tapes, again, are not
fully transcribed. Petitioner asked for the entire
tapes to come in at the -- at the tail end of the trial,
which -- which was -- based on the government's showing
that was uncontested that Petitioner was at the scene,
he drove the $23,000 there, he waited with Perez and
Cruz while the informant was coming back, he was there
when the call was made to the informant that said they
had the money.
Now, there's some dispute over whether he
said that, but certainly he was there when that call was
made because that's what triggered the raid. All of
that was basically undisputed. You've got all these
calls that tie Petitioner to Perez -- to Perez,
calls --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're going over
the evidence. And I may simply be asking the same
question Justice Kennedy asked earlier. But let's say
you have a situation where it's the same thing, and at
the -- you, know, and the improperly admitted evidence
has the defendant saying: I'm guilty, I'm guilty. And
the evidence is the same as all you've set forth at
pages 2 through 9, very complicated, who's driving what,
you know, kind of car where, and where they're meeting.
And the jury goes out and comes back in 2 minutes: You
know, the guy said he was guilty.
Is that a situation in which we're supposed
to then go back, look at all the complicated evidence,
and see if a jury would have convicted? Or can we with
a fair degree of confidence say that the error is what
led the jury to convict?
MR. YANG: Well, I think the former, but let
me explain. And again, I'm going to go back to Neder,
if I may, for a second. In Neder, the jury never found
an element of the offense. Never did. There's no
question that the jury's verdict was affected by the
failure to instruct. In fact, it was not just a failure
to instruct. The district court told the jury this is
not for them to consider. And --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But critical to the Court's
view in that case was that the -- the defendant could
not have contested that element.
MR. YANG: Well, but if we're -- again, if
we're focusing on the legal dispute between us and the
other side about whether we're looking at this jury or
what a rational jury would do when you excise the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I would like very
much to know what your answer is to Justice Kennedy's
hypothetical and the Chief Justice's. As I understand
those hypotheticals, they're trying to imagine a case --
MR. YANG: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- where the particular
piece of improperly admitted evidence -- we know from
how the jury reacted, or the kind of evidence -- it's
the kind of thing that could really make a difference.
I mean, they were in tears, et cetera.
MR. YANG: And --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, in my
reading of this, which I once had to read about 100
harmless-error cases, and it seemed to me -- and you can
confirm or deny this -- that in cases like that, the
judge who knows this is a tough case when the jury's
feeling this way, asks himself or herself the question,
could this illegally admitted evidence make a
difference? Could it have made a difference in this
case? Could it have? And the answer is going to be
"no" where that judge thinks a reasonable jury would not
have thought it made a critical difference.
And that's just putting the same thing I
think slightly differently. But the answer in
Justice Kennedy's case would be a judge just isn't going
to think it has nothing to do with rationality. If the
jury's in tears, they're going to think it's a close
case. And, therefore, if in fact this could have made a
difference, the judge says, yes, it's not harmless.
And if the judge thinks, no, it couldn't
have made a difference to any rational person, he's
going to say "harmless." Period.
Now, that was my impression reading those
cases. And I felt that those hypotheticals were getting
at that. And -- use them. Answer them rather than me,
because that's what I'm interested in.
(Laughter.)
MR. YANG: The answer is that in a case
where the jury -- where you have some very provocative
evidence, but there's also a very strong case that
exists -- it may depend on the level of certainty that
you need to get to, whether it's a fair assurance or
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. But even in those
cases, you can -- if the court looks at the evidence as
a whole and says that there was so much evidence before
this stuff came in, this bad -- this error came in, that
a rational jury would have gotten to the same result,
that it would have convicted, then --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose the
judge concludes that both this jury that I had and some
hypothetical rational jury would have been so focused on
this evidence that that's all they would have looked at,
but if they had looked at 1 through 9, the admissible
evidence, they would still have found guilt.
Is that -- is that what you're -- is that --
MR. YANG: I think so, but let me give you
an example.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- a proper application of
the -- of the framework?
MR. YANG: I think so, but it's not, again,
what a -- what this particular jury was doing, because
we know, for instance, from Neder or in the confession
cases, the jury hears a confession, an
unconstitutionally obtained confession,
unconstitutionally admitted, from the defendant, that is
going to be -- right there. You know? A jury -- a
juror could say: Let's go home, we have a confession.
It's out of his own mouth. There's very little else to
debate.
But when the evidence is beyond that
confession, so overwhelming that no rational jury would
have gotten to a different result, and you could say
that with a fair assurance or if there's a
constitutional error as it would be with a confession
beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court says that this is
harmless.
And the reason that the Court's taking that
inquiry is because it recognized -- the Court's long
recognized that no trial is perfect, that there are very
significant costs of retrial. And so, the premise
there --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you are
essentially saying, as I understand you, that if there
was such a thing as a directed verdict in a criminal
case, if the judge would say, you know, I will direct a
verdict here because there's only one way a rational --
rational jury could come out.
MR. YANG: This -- that argument was
specifically rejected by this Court in Neder. The same
question came up, and in fact, Neder is a much -- more
difficult case for the government than this, because at
least in Neder, the defendant had the argument that this
jury could -- did not find guilt beyond reasonable doubt
because it was never instructed to find an element of
the offense.
JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Yang, I think you may be
taking a harder position than you really need to. Why
shouldn't the rule be that the -- the appellate court
should look at what would be done by a rational jury,
except in the kind of extraordinary circumstances that
have been posited by Justice Kagan's hypothetical and a
few of the other questions, simply because it's so
difficult to determine what a -- what the jury was
actually doing?
We have a rule that prohibits consideration
of what goes on in the jury room. But suppose we didn't
have that. Suppose that it was all videotaped, and the
jury didn't know what was going on, so you could -- you
could watch it and see. If that were the case, then
surely the rule would be what would this jury have done?
But most of the time, it's just speculation to tell what
a jury -- what they -- did they come back quickly?
Well, that shows that this evidence was so bad that it
caused them to render a quick verdict in what otherwise
would have been a difficult case.
Did they take a long time? Well, it shows
it was a close case, and, therefore, any error might
have tipped them one way or the other.
You just can't tell.
MR. YANG: I'm -- I don't want to resist
this too much, because I think we're fighting about
things at the very extreme. Most of the times that
we're talking about these purported indications from the
jury, it's entirely ambiguous. And the -- so, there may
be well be extreme examples. And I think those would
rightfully influence a court's consideration in a case.
But, again, when you have harmless-error
cases in which we know for a certainty, as in Neder,
that the jury did not find an element of the offense,
the inquiry has to be, it has to be, on what the Court
has repeatedly said in -- this is I believe on pages 19
of our brief -- that the focus of the harmless-error
inquiry is bringing the court's attention to the fact
that the primary purpose of a trial is the factual
question of guilt or innocence.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you read --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, when you
began, if I'm remembering correctly, you said there were
two ways in which your position was different from Mr.
Brindley's.
MR. YANG: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One I understand is
that you look at a rational jury --
MR. YANG: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and not the
particular jury.
What's the second?
MR. YANG: Well, it's related. His focus on
the -- this jury I believe is seeing whether there's
some influence on the process, deliberative process,
even if the outcome would have been the same absent the
error. And so, he's kind of trying to get into the
minds of the jury. And this Court has repeatedly
rejected that. Again --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask you a different
question, Mr. Yang, which is, you know, this difference
in the formulation of the test, which I find it hard to
wrap my mind around, but -- and it strikes me that
there's two different ways of saying the same thing.
But I'm told that there's a fair bit of scholarship out
there which suggests that courts that use one
formulation tend to come out one way, and courts that
use the other formulation tend to come out the other
way.
And I'm just wondering what your view of
that is, that somehow one formulation seems to put the
emphasis on the entire case, whereas the other
formulation seems to put the emphasis on only the
government's evidence, and that that makes a difference
in the end.
MR. YANG: We don't think that there is this
deep -- there are some disagreements or some things we
disagree with about what courts of appeals do in any
particular cases. But with respect to this formulation
of the -- I think Petitioner calls it the guilt-focused
versus effect-of-the-error-focused approaches, the
scholarship -- I think he relies principally on Judge
Edwards' opinion about harmless error. That came out in
95, when it was already swimming against -- upstream
against this Court's harmless-error decisions.
But he had in his pocket the Sullivan
decision, which was admittedly a structural-error case,
but there was language in Sullivan which suggested that
you need to look at what this particular jury was going
to do.
Then we have Neder and -- I can't pronounce
this very well -- but Recuenco. It's the -- the
Apprendi application of Neder, which specifically rejects
this kind of broad logic in Sullivan as being
inconsistent with the Court's harmless-error cases.
Now --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You do agree -- you do
agree that the government has the burden of showing that
the error is harmless?
MR. YANG: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's the government's
burden. And you also agree that we should look at the
evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant in
making --
MR. YANG: No. The Court, even in -- I
think most recently, the Court explained in Shinseki,
talking about Kotteakos, that you don't use these kind
of presumptions or rigid rules. And the reason that you
do, that you're kind of looking from the perspective of
a reasonable jury, is the jury has in fact found the
defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And then
the question is, are you setting aside that verdict
because -- do you think that this error was the thing
that tipped the scales from not guilty to guilty? And
so, taking a look at the evidence, kind of with all
presumptions favoring one side or the other, is not how
this Court has conducted the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, what does it mean
that the government has the burden? What does the
government have to do?
MR. YANG: The government has to show, as --
this is the formulation in Neder and which the Court has
said in Neder is the same thing that applied in
erroneous admissions or exclusions of evidence, that a
rational jury would have found the defendant guilty
absent the error, and that involves the three core
elements we explained in our brief. And then the Court
takes into account --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The absent error. So,
that means -- wait. You look at just the evidence
that's not tainted?
MR. YANG: In some cases you can do that,
where the evidence is so overwhelming -- if I -- if I
may finish.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Briefly.
MR. YANG: Briefly. In some cases, you
might do that. In other cases where it's close or the
evidence is not so strong, you need to look at the error
to see if that error was going to be a dispositive thing
in getting to guilt.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Chief Justice allowed
me to ask one question. Could I amend your statement so
that you would say a rational jury in all the
circumstances of this case, given what this jury heard,
would have?
MR. YANG: Yes. It's -- in the position of
this jury, based on the evidence presented to the jury,
correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Brindley, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BEAU R. BRINDLEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRINDLEY: I first want to address
Neder, which Government counsel continually referenced.
Neder talks about the reasonable jury, but Neder also
limits itself to situations where the evidence is
uncontroverted and inconvertible, I think because in
those situations the difference between the reasonable
jury and this jury would be deemed to be nonexistent
because it would be impossible for the error to have an
impact.
Secondly, I think it's important to note
from Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, if you don't
consider the error, then even that extreme case, that
would have to be ignored. And so, I think the
Government's formulation and the formulation used by the
appellate court below would justify -- would lead to
that bad conclusion.
I also think that when you do that
formulation, where you're talking about the reasonable
jury and absence of error, the reason those cases come
out different is because those courts think they don't
have to address the error, which is I think what
happened in the majority below, why they didn't address
it despite the dissent.
The other thing I think it's important to
note is the reason you have to look at the error and its
possible impact and not just whether you could be
convicted on the other evidence is because you say,
well, he could be convicted on the other evidence. If
that's all that you're saying and you -- and it's not on
the evidence which could independently in this case be a
reason to convict, then I think you're making that guilt
determination that this Court says is not supposed to
happen. And I think the majority's opinion below is
consistent with that approach, and there's nothing in it
to suggest that's not exactly what they did.
I also think that in the end -- there was a
mention of the limiting instruction; a limiting
instruction would have cured this problem. We assume
juries would follow it. That means they wouldn't have
concluded that his lawyer thought him guilty and then
put Mrs. Perez on the stand and concluded she wasn't
telling the truth.
What this error allows, what -- if taken for
its truth, a jury could believe that he confessed to his
lawyer. They could disregard everything that was said
on his behalf. They could say we know that he's guilty;
his lawyer knew he was guilty; we can convict him on
that basis. That's an error that can infect the
entirety of the proceedings.
And if you look at this jury and what they
heard, and the question comes down to whether Mrs. Perez
is credible or not, there is nothing in this record the
Government can point to that would allow a reviewing
court to make that determination. A reviewing court
that didn't see --
JUSTICE ALITO: Did the panel majority in --
did the panel majority in this case say anything that
differs from what this Court has said about harmless
error? If we were to reverse, what would we point to in
the panel majority's opinion that was erroneous?
MR. BRINDLEY: I think you would point to
that first statement of the test where they say whether
the reasonable jury would convict him absent the error,
because Kotteakos says you can't strip the error out.
This Court has never overruled Kotteakos.
The other thing --
JUSTICE ALITO: Hasn't this Court said
exactly what Seventh Circuit said there? In other
cases?
MR. BRINDLEY: This Court has used, I think,
dicta that has language of that sort. But in those
cases, what the Court does -- like in Harrington, they
look at what the error was; they put it in the context
of the whole case, and they can say the government could
prove the jury didn't look at this to the right degree
of assurance, because it was cumulative, because --
there's no -- there's nothing --
JUSTICE ALITO: You want us to say -- you
want us to say we're reversing you, Seventh Circuit
panel, because you said what we have said in prior
cases, but we were wrong?
MR. BRINDLEY: I think the reason to reverse
them is because that formulation has proven to lead to
the wrong analysis, in all of these lower courts, this
guilt-based approach; and it is not the law of
Kotteakos. This Court has never overruled Kotteakos.
And to focus on it allows a guilt
determination by a reviewing court that would be
violative of the Sixth Amendment that this Court was
concerned about in Kotteakos, that this Court was
concerned about in Sullivan, that this Court was even
concerned about in Neder, outside the scope of cases
where the evidence is uncontestable.
Because if you took these statements as true
and then you came down to a question, well, is Marina
credible or not, Mrs. Perez, there's nothing the
government can do on this record to prove that the jury
would have found her credibility differently because
this Court can't figure that out on a cold record.
It said so, many times. It's not possible
to do, especially in a case that's based on
circumstantial evidence like this one.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
