CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear
argument next in Case 08-1569, United States v. O'Brien.
Mr. Horwich.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN HORWICH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HORWICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Section 924(c)(1) starts by defining a
single crime of using or carrying a firearm during and
in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking
crime.
Next, it addresses sentencing, and it does
that by giving the judge some rules to channel his
discretion in particular cases, and among those is a
requirement that a, quote, “person convicted of a
violation” … “shall be sentenced” to a greater minimum
sentence when the firearm is of a particular type.
And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well wait. There’s --
there’s some sentencing stuff in -- in the first part
as well. There’s sentencing stuff in (A). You can't
say that (A) deals only with elements and (B) deals
with sentencing.
MR. HORWICH: Well, no, and, of course --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, (A) says, "shall be
sentenced to 5 years." Or to 7 years, or to 10 years.
So there’s sentencing stuff in (A).
MR. HORWICH: Well, I agree with you that
the phrase "be sentenced" certainly appears in (A) as
well. To the extent a statute is going to direct a
particular sentence, it’s going to use those words.
But I think the -- we’re relying a lot
more on the language in the beginning of subparagraph (B),
that says, "if the firearm possessed by a person convicted
of a violation," which necessarily presupposes, then, that
there has been a conviction --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So does -- so does the language
of (A)(ii) and (A)(iii), which is the same language: “if
the firearm is brandished”; “if the firearm is
discharged” -- they all apply to a conviction for carrying
the firearm. There has to be a conviction before those
things apply.
MR. HORWICH: Well, I agree. That's true.
That is certainly an accurate statement --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So that makes (A) the same
as (B). And -- and you don't claim that the elements in (A)
are just sentencing elements, do you?
MR. HORWICH: Well, I certainly don't claim
that they -- that the elements in the principal
paragraph of (A) are. The point I’m -- the point I'm
trying to make is that, with respect to firearm type,
which is at issue here, is that the firearm type
provisions are introduced by specific language that
says -- that tells the reader these are relevant to a
person convicted of a violation; these are not relevant
to whether --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but you’re
forgetting the words of this subsection. I mean --
MR. HORWICH: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the subsection would be
(B) itself. If you're convicted of carrying a machinegun,
you get -- I'm sorry -- a short-barrel rifle, et cetera,
you get 10 years. If it's a machinegun, you get 30.
What's -- what's irrational about reading
the statute that way when it uses the word "subsection"?
It didn't use "subparagraph."
MR. HORWICH: Well, I agree it doesn't use
"subparagraph." And "subsection" certainly in
conventional use in drafting would refer actually to
4(c) as a whole.
But -- but looking to the word "this
subsection," Justice Sotomayor, is not -- is not useful
for distinguishing among the elements and the sentencing
factors, because of course there are, I think --
certainly this Court's holding in Harris says that the
brandishing and the discharge provisions are sentencing
factors. They are part of this subsection.
All the courts of appeals have held, and
it's the entirely natural inference of the recidivism
provisions in subparagraph (C), which is also part of
this subsection, are -- are themselves sentencing
factors. So saying that something is in this subsection
means that it might be part of a violation doesn't
actually answer what is or is not part of the violation
versus --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But still and all, if -- if
Congress were being precise and if the statute is to be
read the way you suggest, the introduction to capital
(B) should have been "if the firearm possessed by a
person convicted of a violation of paragraph (A) above,"
and then pick it up, "is," so forth.
Right? I mean, that would -- would be more
precise.
MR. HORWICH: That -- that I think would be so
precise that we wouldn't be here discussing it today. I
agree with that.
But, of course, Congress has also used that
same reference to “subsection” throughout -- throughout the
entire statute, even if it's not being used in the most
precise sense, in the sense that a violation of this
subsection appears in subparagraph (C), it appears in
subparagraph (D), which is not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MR. HORWICH: -- which is not then to say that
this subsection -- that everything in this subsection is an
element. The Court has held otherwise already.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess I agree with you
that if (B) is -- if (B) is an element, (C) would be an
element, too.
MR. HORWICH: Well, that certainly would be
the inference. And that would be quite contrary to the
traditional treatment of recidivism.
But, more generally, the tradition that
Congress is working within in this new statute -- which,
I want to point out, is significantly different in -- in
a very substantive way from the old statute -- that the
new statute proscribes a statutory maximum of life in
all cases. That is different from the old statute. The
old statute --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is this to do -- I
mean, the obvious question, to me, is -- since I wrote
the -- I think I wrote the opinion in Castillo -- is we
looked at the language of the statute, very similar to
this, and we said: Machinegun means a separate crime.
And they recodified it. And it looks to me as if all
they did was take the things that we previously said
were separate crimes and put them in (B), and take the
things that are obviously sentencing factors and put
them in (A) and (C).
All right. Now, that's what it looks like
if you just read the statute. I didn't find anything in
the history that suggested any other intent. So why do
you think that that change makes the difference?
MR. HORWICH: Well, I think there are --
there are several specific changes that Congress made.
And I think it would be, perhaps, useful to look at the
old statute and the new one, the old statute and the new
one together and see why the things that -- that the
Court said in Castillo are gone in the new one. So the
old statute is in the petition appendix at 11a.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. HORWICH: And then the new statute is in
the appendix to the government's opening brief at 1a and
a, so you can look at them side by side.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't the old one in your
brief, too, in your --
MR. HORWICH: It is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's 3a of the government's
brief.
MR. NORWICH: It is, although, of course,
you have to turn the page, and I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Okay.
MR. HORWICH: Perhaps it's helpful to look
at them next to each other, because the differences are
quite stark --
JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.
MR. HOWICH: -- when you do that.
So the first thing is, as you suggested,
Justice Breyer, the firearm type provisions were moved.
But I think that that move signals something contrary to
what this Court had perceived in Castillo. In Castillo,
the firearm type provisions were part of the initial
sentence that defined the elements. The sentence is
rolling along, talking about using or carrying a
firearm, and then in the same breath it goes on to start
talking about specific weapons. And that is what, in my
reading of Castillo, drove the Court's impression that
the they -- that the machinegun provision there should be
an element.
The difference in the new statute is -- is
that Congress has moved it away, textually,
conceptually, structurally, away from the elements,
which ought to suggest that Congress doesn't think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it didn't. It kept
in (A) the subdivisions of use and brandishing, which
we all agree are elements of the crime. So I don't know
what it means to say that it moved it away from the
elements. It mixed up in (A) elements and sentencing
factors, and so what we have to discern was, did it
intend to make (B) sentencing factors or not?
And I think what Justice Breyer was asking
you: What in the legislative history shows that? Where
do we read, outside of Castillo, a conclusion that
somehow Congress radically changed the assumptions we
identified in Castillo, which is historically it's not a
sentencing element?
MR. HORWICH: So a few answers there.
First of all, in the new -- in the new
structure of the statute, on the government's view, the
elements finish in the principal paragraph, and then --
then we're into sentencing factors. So brandishing and
discharge were held in Harris and acknowledged in Dean
to be sentencing factors. So we are sort of, at that
point, on to sentencing factors.
So I take from what this Court said in
Harris, about the separation of brandishing and discharge
from the elements in the principal paragraph to indicate
that they are sentencing factors, would apply even more
strongly to subparagraph (C), which is even farther
away. There’s -- there’s a period, a structural break,
a new sentence. The thought in the principal paragraph is
certainly complete. We’ve already been through some
other sentencing factors, and now we’re --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except that with --
with (C), you -- you could say that traditionally
recidivism has been a sentencing factor, and you cannot
say with respect to (B) that whether it's a
short-barreled rifle or a machinegun has traditionally
been a sentencing factor. To the contrary, it was an
element.
MR. HORWICH: Well, I disagree with that,
Justice Scalia, because the tradition, as I understand
it, is relevant because it might indicate what Congress
was thinking or what suppositions it had in mind when it
passed a statute.
And there’s a very -- there was a very
different tradition at the time of the 1986 enactment of
the old statute and the 1998 enactment of the new one,
which is -- the big difference is that the sentencing
guidelines came into effect in between those two times.
And the sentencing guidelines -- sentencing
guideline 2K2.1, the principal determinant of base
offense level in the sentencing guidelines for
firearm-centric offenses in the Federal criminal law, was
firearm type. So it was unmistakably that -- it was
unmistakable at the time in 1998 when Congress enacted
these -- these firearm-type provisions, that the
sentencing guidelines were already making firearm type a
sentencing consideration for the judge.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's -- let's talk about
the guidelines. Without the application of (B), the
guidelines would provide for a much shorter sentence,
wouldn't they?
MR. HORWICH: Well, the guidelines -- as
before and as now for this offense, the guidelines level
is the minimum.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The guidelines -- do you
think that if under the guidelines the sentence was
years because of a machinegun, do you think that that
would be upheld?
MR. HORWICH: I'm sorry. And your -- if I
understand you --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it would be
upheld as a reasonable sentence under our Booker/Fanfan
theory of -- of how the guidelines are to be applied?
MR. HORWICH: A reasonable -- well,
certainly courts have, since Booker, imposed even up to
a life sentence for offenses that did not otherwise
trigger the elevated minimums. There’s at least one
case in the few years since Booker that implied a --
that imposed a life sentence for a -- for an offense
that would have been subject only to the base 5-year
maximum. There are several that imposed -- imposed a
life sentence for --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is the life
sentence maximum, by the way? I -- you say this is a
minimum. It's just a mandatory minimum because the
maximum is specified to be life. Where is that specified?
MR. HORWICH: The -- the maximum is not
textually in the statute, but all courts that have looked
at this have understood that. Certainly, it seems to be
the supposition of this Court's statutory holding in Harris
that the nature of -- the structure of this -- of the
sentencing provision here is that there's a life maximum,
and then the firearm --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where do you get
the life maximum? I -- I'm reading through, and there's
-- it mentions nothing about life.
MR. HORWICH: Well, it is certainly the
case, if we simply take (a)(1) --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And if it mentions nothing
about life, then these are not mandatory minimums. To
the contrary, they are -- they are new maximums.
MR. HORWICH: I absolutely disagree. If it
says “at least,” that can only mean that there can be some
-- a sentence higher than that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the life part of
the --
MR. HORWICH: Or not less than.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what the substantive
crime was? Is it the attempted robbery or whatever it was?
Is that -- because this is -- you're -- you’re saying this
is an add-on to an underlying offense.
MR. HORWICH: Well, I wouldn't describe it
as an add-on. It is a separate Federal crime, in -- in
the sense -- in the sense that it is bad enough and
dangerous enough to commit a drug trafficking offense
or engage in a crime of --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then -- then you
wouldn't be relying on what might be a life sentence
for the underlying crime.
MR. HORWICH: I -- oh, I'm sorry. I -- I
may have -- may have misspoken.
In response to Justice Scalia's question, my
answer -- my answer was directed to imposing a life
sentence on the 924(c) conviction, separate from
whatever sentence may have been imposed on the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but where do you get
the maximum? You say, oh, these are just minimums.
MR. HORWICH: Well, they are minimums
because they say "not less than 5 years." That applies --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But where is -- where is
the maximum?
MR. HORWICH: The -- well, because there is
no stated maximum, the -- the assumption then must be
that a sentence higher than 5 years is appropriate.
There is no --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a Sixth
Amendment problem with reading a statute this way,
with -- with reading a statute to provide for an
unlimited maximum when Congress hasn't specified it, and
now you’re going to have the judge find the minimum and
the maximum?
MR. HORWICH: Well, I don't -- I disagree
that the judge is finding the maximum. The -- the
implied maximum term here is -- is life. Congress --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't find that implied
at all. I don't see why it's implied.
MR. HORWICH: Well, the trouble,
Justice Scalia, is then that I don't otherwise know what
the maximum would be.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. That’s --
MR. HORWICH: The maximum --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's her question.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't there a Sixth
Amendment problem with not knowing what you are exposed
to? And then doesn't the minimum in that case sort of
become de facto the maximum?
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think what you are
exposed to, as I read the statute, (c)(1)(A) does not
impose a new sentence at all. It just says there will
be added to whatever the sentence is for the crime of
violence or the drug trafficking crime -- there will be
added to that sentence. Then it says you’ll add 7
years; you’ll add 25 years; you’ll add 30 years.
Those are not mandatory minimums. Those are
add-ons to the sentence provided by the substantive
crime to which (c)(1)(A) refers. That way, the whole
thing makes sense.
MR. HORWICH: Well, I don't think it would
make sense to treat them, as you are describing them, as
add-ons. There’s no question that this -- that this
statute defines an offense that someone can be convicted
of. That certainly is the implication of this Court's
holding in Deal. It is a separate offense which
therefore should carry its own punishment. And the
contrast --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I’ll amend what I said.
It is a mandatory minimum if the substantive crime
referred to in (c)(1)(A) is above what is specified
in -- in this statute. But if it -- if it is below
that, if the drug trafficking crime only provided for
years, and you did the crime with a machinegun, you
get 30 years, that's an add-on.
MR. HORWICH: Well, I -- I think it would be
helpful then to compare this to the -- the language of
the prior statute, which describes exactly what you are
describing.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I got it.
MR. HORWICH: Which is -- which is that
whoever during or in relation, et cetera, et cetera,
uses or carries a firearm --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give us the page?
MR. HORWICH: I'm sorry, this is at 11a of
the petition appendix.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's also on 3a of the
government's brief.
MR. HORWICH: Or 3a of the -- of the
government's -- the government’s brief.
The old statute said exactly what you are
describing, Justice Scalia, which is that whoever during
or in relation to a crime of violence, et cetera, uses
or carries a firearm shall, in addition to the
punishment provided for such crime of violence, et
cetera -- and then it specifies --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. HORWICH: -- particular determinate
sentences.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. HORWICH: If Congress had wanted to
continue that approach, I assume it would have kept that
language. It didn't. It changed the language. The new
language says "be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of
not less than 5 years," which leaves -- which leaves --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It says “in addition to” at
the end of (c)(1)(A): “Who, in furtherance … possesses a
firearm shall, in addition to the punishment provided
for by such crime of violence, be sentenced to” 5
years, 7 years, 10 years. And then if the
firearm, blah, blah, blah, is blah, blah, blah -- since
your -- I assume that that introductory language "in
addition to the punishment provided for" is implicit in
(B). It's expressed in (A), but I think it's implicit
in (B).
MR. HORWICH: That -- I understand that
language, the in -- the "in addition to" language, to
have -- to have been to make clear that this is a
separate offense. There is separate punishment for a
separate conviction of this separate offense.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MR. HORWICH: And that then it is a
separate -- then from there it is a question what is the
appropriate sentence for a conviction on the offense
described in 924(c)(1), which is to say, well, it's a
term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years, which
holds open --
JUSTICE SCALIA: In addition to the term
that’s -- that exists for the substantive offense.
MR. HORWICH: I -- I agree. And if you look
in subparagraph (D)(ii) it says that the term of
imprisonment imposed under this subsection shall run
consecutive to the other one, which -- which again shows
that -- that the considerations for sentencing in this
-- in this law are distinct from the -- it is a -- it is
a separate question what the sentence on the 924(c) --
JUSTICE BREYER: To make your life a little
more complicated and difficult, though perhaps it makes
it easier, we reach the questions that Justice Scalia
was raising, I think, and they are important only if you
win, only if we say that it is a sentencing factor. If
it is a new crime, we don't have any problem, because if
it's a new crime, the jury has to find the fact.
But if it's a sentencing factor, then we get
into the problem of Harris versus Apprendi. And then you
have to decide whether it's maximum, minimum, et cetera.
But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover
mandatory minimums, but I don't accept Apprendi. Well,
at some point I guess I have to accept Apprendi, because
it's the law and has been for some time.
So if and in fact, unfortunately for
everyone, I was -- it was 5-4 in that, I think, so my vote
mattered, and I don't know what other people think
but in -- on this Court. But if that becomes an issue,
if that should become an issue about whether mandatory
minimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi
purposes, should we reset the case for argument? Or do
you feel, in your opinion that -- that you’ve had
enough of an argument because you devoted two or three
pages to this topic?
MR. HORWICH: Well, to answer -- well, first
of all, there certainly has not been in -- in the
briefing or argument here, any opportunity for this Court
to consider what it would need to consider to overrule
McMillan. We’re not talking about overruling Harris.
We’re talking about overruling McMillan. And --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I think basically
Apprendi did significantly change McMillan, but that’s --
MR. HORWICH: Well, and that’s -- and that
would be my -- my second point, is that -- is that since
-- I think it has been become clearer since Harris that
the rule in McMillan and the rule in Apprendi coexist
quite well and coexist in a principled fashion, and
that there is -- and that there is no -- Harris was
correct in light of Apprendi, which is -- which is in
the following respect.
JUSTICE BREYER: Does the government believe
that it has sufficiently argued this, or would you suggest
on the government's behalf that if it becomes an issue
it's set for reargument? That was really my question.
MR. HORWICH: Well, yes, we would certainly
want to set it for reargument --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the right answer.
MR. HORWICH: -- obviously.
(Laughter.)
MR. HORWICH: But -- but I -- again, I don't
even think that's necessary. Respondents have offered
nothing in the way of a justification for overruling
Harris. And again, the distinction is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why can't we just say, as
Judge Boudin did, they weren't -- this revision was on
the books before Castillo was decided, so obviously
Congress wasn't trying to adjust the statute in response
to Castillo. And they -- they made it read more easily.
We know the one thing Congress was concerned with was adding
possession, which was not there before. So they added
possession. They made it more readable.
Some of the concerns that were expressed in
Castillo are certainly present here. There is a huge
jump from a 5-year add-on to a 30-year add-on for -- for
the machinegun. So why don't we just say, well, this
statute has been revised, but it wasn't in response to
Castillo? It's not all that different.
MR. HORWICH: Well, I disagree that it's
not all that different. And -- and for the following
three -- for three reasons. First of all, setting aside
my disagreement with Justice Scalia, if you accept that
the statutory maximum is life, as I believe every court
to have confronted this understands it to be, then this
statute belongs to an entirely different tradition than
the tradition that Castillo belonged to, which is to
say that this statute -- the -- the role of firearm type
in this statute is to channel the sentencing judge's
discretion by ruling out certain low sentences when
certain facts are present, such as the presence of a
machinegun.
That is something that when Congress wants
to channel --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't a minimum always a
maximum?
MR. HORWICH: No, I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In -- to the person who
would otherwise, in the judge's discretion, qualify for a
lower sentence, doesn't it become that person's maximum
once you have indiscretion?
MR. HORWICH: I disagree with that because
the principle -- the background -- the basic principle
behind Apprendi and our criminal law is that what you
can rely on is what Congress has said in the statute or
in -- as Booker holds --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you can rely on in
an indeterminate sentencing regime without a minimum is
that you’ve got a statutory maximum, whatever it may
be, but a judge's discretion to start from zero. If
that judge was inclined to give you zero, isn't the
minimum then your statutory maximum? You're -- because
that's what the judge has to give you.
MR. HORWICH: I disagree with that, because
it is not the only thing the judge can give you. The
full range of punishment above those minimums is
available. I was indicating earlier that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel -- counsel,
I think you had said you had three responses to Justice
Ginsburg --
MR. HORWICH: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and only got one out.
MR. HORWICH: Right, and perhaps only
half of that one, which is -- which is that in the -- on
the question of -- of tradition, Congress apparently
exclusively uses sentencing factors when it wants to do
nothing more than give some rules to the judge to
channel his discretion with minimum sentences. We
observed this in our opening brief, and Respondents said
nothing in response.
As far as we know, every time Congress wants
to channel a sentencing judge's discretion, it does it
with a sentencing factor. That is a difference.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Number two?
MR. HORWICH: Number two is that the -- is
that the -- the -- the linguistic change here, the
textual change, the fact that subparagraph (D) says "a
person convicted of a violation of this subsection."
That presupposes there has been a conviction, that the
jury has been charged with whatever the elements of the
offense are and that now what's going to be stated in
clauses (B)(i) and (B)(ii) are things that are relevant
at sentencing.
And then the third -- and then the third
point is -- is that -- is essentially the structural
change from -- that I alluded to earlier, of moving
firearm type wholly away from the elements of the
offense. That made a difference to this Court in
Harris. It is -- it would be, I think, irreconcilable
with this Court's holding in Harris to say that
brandishing and discharge have been moved far enough
away from the elements to make them sentencing factors,
or rather are stated far enough away from the elements,
structurally separated enough to make them
sentencing factors, but then to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are all -- all
three of those are -- are pretty subtle ways for
Congress to change the view in Castillo.
MR. HORWICH: Well, I would agree that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Moving something
from the body of the paragraph to a separate section and
so on.
MR. HORWICH: Well, I would -- I would point
out -- of course, one has to -- one has to recognize what
Congress had before it when it -- when it made the
change, which is to say, when it -- when it embarked on
these revisions, there was a one-to-one circuit split on
the question. And by the time it had finished making
the changes, it was actually three to one in favor of
sentencing factor interpretation in the old statute.
Now, I agree that if Castillo had been on
the books and Congress had said nothing about it, that
might be a basis to say that Congress was acquiescing in
that interpretation. But it's -- it's -- Congress was
certainly concerned with much more substantial issues in
the revisions. And the fact that it did not comment
further should not be a reason to -- to not pay
attention to the structural and textural changes that it
did make.
I’d like to reserve.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We have tall lawyers today.
What is this, tall lawyer day?
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I think it's important at the outset to set
the context for this case. The government cannot point
to a single defendant under this provision for the
conduct at issue who has ever received more than
years in prison absent the use of a machinegun.
We cited a long string of cases in the
O'Brien brief and the government's response in its reply
brief was silent. So, therefore, the government is here
today claiming that it is entitled, based on the fact of
a machinegun, to get 20 years more than any defendant
that perpetrated this conduct has ever gotten, and
indeed 18 more years than the government itself asked
the district judge in this case for, once the machinegun
provision was off the table, under the guise that this
is nothing more than a sentencing factor.
We think that this Court's statutory
interpretation jurisprudence as well, if necessary, this
Court's constitutional jurisprudence foreclose such a
result.
Let me start with statutory interpretation.
On the government's theory in 1998, Congress stepped in
and took a statute that made machinegun use an element
and transformed it into -- into a sentencing factor. In
other words, Congress, without a peep, a mutter, or
anything, and in -- in the course of doing something
entirely different, which was reacting to this Court's
Bailey decision, stepped in and took a fact that
formerly had to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt to trigger a 30-year sentence and left that same
sentence in place but now allowed it to be proved to a
judge by a preponderance, based on a presentence report,
and, indeed, according to the government, also stripped
away the mens rea requirement that attached to the
statute when it was an element.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the short --
what is it, the one that gets 10 years, the
short-barreled rifle? That's -- that's -- those two
are together in the statute, and you said that it would
be startling because of the difference between 10 years
and the 30 years, but the short-barreled rifle is the
same amount of time in discharging, and discharging is a
sentencing factor.
MR. FISHER: We think, Justice Ginsburg,
that if this Court had to construe that statute in a
different case, that provision, it would find it's still
an element. Now, I grant that it’s a difference, a
very significant difference between 10 and 30 years, but
structurally it is an element.
And I think an -- a good way to go about
understanding this -- I heard my -- my opponent today say
that this would be indistinguishable from Harris or fly
in the face of Harris.
Well, there's three very important
differences between the machinegun provision at issue
here and the discharge provision in Dean and the
brandishing provision in Harris. The first difference
is that this an entirely separate subparagraph.
Now, if you imagine somebody amending the
statute and wanting to accomplish what the government
says was accomplished here, why wouldn't the firearm
type provisions just have been (iv) and (v) under
capital letter (A)? They’re not.
What the draftsperson did instead is break
them out into an entirely separate, stand-alone
provision. As the AUSA described it, when he charged
them in the alternative in the district of
Massachusetts, he said I think it's a greater and lesser
offense situation. And that's what we think.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I guess I'm not
following the ball here. I thought the government had
conceded that sub (i), sub (ii), sub (iii) under (A) are
not sentencing factors but are elements. Is that not --
MR. FISHER: I don't understand that to be
what the government has said. I believe the
government's argument is that the big paragraph with
capital letter (A) sets forth the elements, and then sub
(i), (ii), and (iii) are merely sentencing factors.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, they have to because
that's what Harris said, brandished --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That’s -- yes, that’s Harris.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- brandished is a
sentencing factor.
MR. FISHER: That's right. That's right,
Justice Ginsburg.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's even worse,
then. I agree with you.
(Laughter.)
MR. FISHER: So what sub (B) does, as I
said, is it creates a greater offense, and so, it’s
broken out in a way that incorporates the earlier
elements up above in the main paragraph by using the
phrase: If a “firearm possessed by a person
convicted of a violation of this subsection.”
That phrase, we believe, incorporates the
earlier elements. Remember in Harris this Court
emphasized that the brandishing provision just kept
going in the sentence and did not incorporate earlier
elements.
So when the government stands here today and
says, well, when you incorporate the earlier elements,
that shows it’s a sentencing factor, too, it seems to me a
situation of heads, I win; tails, you lose.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, their -- their -- their
basic argument is look at the statute. (A) has what is
undoubtedly a set of sentencing factors. Brandishing and
discharging are as traditional as they come. Then look
at (C), and you find some other ones that are sentencing
factors, because recidivism is as traditional as it
comes. And between those two they put (B).
So since the neighbors, (A) and (C), are
certainly sentencing, they must have meant (B) to be a
sentencing factor, too. I -- as I understand it, that
is one of their basic arguments.
MR. FISHER: Right. And let me -- let me
give two responses to that. First of all, if you --
if you look again at the appendix of the government's
main brief, which is 1a and 2a, the guts of the
statute is the “use or carry” language or “possesses a firearm”
language in the main paragraph.
And then, the -- from the “possessed” language
down through sub (iii), what you have is the Bailey fix
right there. So, then what happens --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you believe there is a
background of life sentence? You agree with the
government that --
MR. FISHER: I don't think that’s
necessarily the case, Justice Scalia. This Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it either is or
isn't. You --
MR. FISHER: -- has said a couple of times
that this is a theoretical maximum sentence, but, surely,
if nothing else, the Sentencing Reform Act sets a
maximum sentence here if it's not just a straight
determinant sentence.
And we've argued at length in the O'Brien
brief that the reasonableness requirement under 3553 of
the Sentencing Reform Act would have to set a maximum
sentence. And for the reason I said at the outset,
given that no one has ever received more than 10 years
absent a machinegun here, certainly that maximum
sentence would be far less than life and far less than
years. But --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the -- I don't want
to interrupt your nice organization here. But what is
the principle, the general rule, that you articulate to
support the distinction between 30 being necessarily an
element and 7 a sentencing factor? What's the general
rule here?
MR. FISHER: Let me answer it --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than, this is
just --
MR. FISHER: If I might say one more --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- other than how awful this is.
MR. FISHER: If I might say one more
sentence to Justice Breyer, and then I’ll answer that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Please.
MR. FISHER: Justice Breyer, the other thing
I'd point out is that, so therefore, once you make the
Bailey fix, you just come -- in the old statute, then
you come to the machinegun provision, and you just leave
it where it was. And, in fact, there are plenty of
statutes that we’ve cited in both briefs where there are
elements in the middle, sandwiched between sentencing
factors.
Now, Justice Kennedy, you asked the general
principle. The general principle is this, at least in
terms of this Court's Sixth Amendment law, is that: The
critical question to ask is whether the defendant could
receive the sentence the government seeks without the
fact at issue.
Seven years is a sentence the defendant here
could receive without the machinegun finding. Thirty years
is absolutely off bounds.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that just based on
empirical studies or is there guideline support for
that?
MR. FISHER: There is both, Your Honor. Of
course, the guidelines are not binding --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand. I understand
that.
MR. FISHER: -- but the guideline sentences
as -- as to this statute are pegged exactly to the
mandatory minimums.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Could
otherwise receive under what? The sentence -- you say
years is a sentence he could otherwise receive.
MR. FISHER: Under the facts that either we
prove to the jury or are admitted by the defendant.
So -- so in this case, the defendant could receive 7
years, and we've conceded that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There must be some
statutory provision that you -- that you -- that you
rely upon.
MR. FISHER: Oh, certainly, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does 7 years come
from?
MR. FISHER: Seven years comes from -- comes
from the statute, for brandishing, which is what both
defendants had admitted that they did. Seven years --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but we know
that's a sentencing factor.
MR. FISHER: But they've admitted it. So
they've waived any Sixth Amendment right as to that
sentencing factor. We're willing to concede that. But
then you go to the guidelines, which sets a
-year -- a 7-year recommended sentence.
Under this Court's jurisprudence following
Booker, we know that we take that recommendation and we
plug it into section 3553(a), which, if you want the
statutory language, directs that a sentence “no greater
than necessary to serve the following factors” be
introduced -- I'm sorry, be imposed. And when you look
at those factors, disparity is a factor this Court has
left in place and emphasized at every term since Booker,
and the guideline sentence. And when you put -- plug
those things into the facts here, we simply suggest
there is no way that it would be upheld as substantively
reasonable if the defendant got 30 years absent the
machinegun fact here.
And we’ve also cited in our brief several
places where the government itself makes this -- the
mirror image of the argument that I'm making in the
post-Booker, Gall, Rita world, when judges deviate
downward from the guidelines. They emphasize -- we
quoted one Eleventh Circuit case in our brief where the
government got overturned, as substantively unreasonable,
a downward variance from a guideline recommendation,
because no defendant had ever received such a low
sentence.
But I don't have to, of course, hang my hat
on this -- on the strict application of Apprendi here.
We think there's also an even deeper problem that
predates this Court's Apprendi jurisprudence, which was
flagged by this Court as early as McMillan, where this
Court said that if what Congress does is step in
and manipulate the elements of a crime in order
to relieve the government of its obligation to prove
ordinary and traditional elements, then we have a pure
due process problem, irrespective of any Sixth Amendment
problem.
Now, this Court has never found such a
problem, but I would emphasize that the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we find it with
this statute, if there’s a 10-year minimum/maximum
under (A) subdivision (iii) if the firearm is
discharged, and it's 10 years; and if it's a
short-barreled rifle under (B), it's also an equal
amount, of 10 years? I think that's what
Justice Ginsburg was pointing to.
So the question I have for you is: How do
we find substantive unreasonableness?
MR. FISHER: How do we find substantively
unreasonable after Booker?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unreasonableness, that
there was an act of manipulation here, or intent to
manipulate.
MR. FISHER: Well, if you’re asking me the
question -- I want to be sure I understand and answer the
question. If you’re asking me how applying the
principle this Court first articulated in McMillan, and
you apply it here --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.
MR. FISHER: I don't think you have to look
any further -- well, there is two places you can look.
You can look both at the intent of Congress and the
effect of what it did.
The intent of Congress, at least as
hypothesized by the Solicitor General, is laid out at
page 33 of its merits brief, where it says: What
Congress was intending to do here is, quote, "simplify
and streamline guilt-stage proceedings" by relieving the
government of its burden to prove this case -- this fact
beyond a reasonable doubt to the judge. So that strikes
one as, as this Court put it in Harris, an intent to
evade the ordinary requirements in the Fifth and Sixth
Amendments.
Then, as to effect, you can look at what
I've also -- what I've already emphasized, which is that
this sentence simply is not otherwise available, absent
that fact. And that, on its own, ought to tell this Court
that it's dealing with an element.
But if it wants to dig even deeper, it could
-- it could describe it in terms of a 20-year increase
over what the defendant would otherwise get or what,
indeed, as we’ve said, anyone has ever gotten for this act,
absent a machinegun. It could do it in terms of percentage
and say it's 83 percent higher; the Court used the phrase once,
"tail wagging the dog." I don't think it matters
exactly what exact avenue this Court would pick. Again,
if it were doing a constitutional analysis -- I’m
speaking right now constitutionally instead of
statutorily -- it would all end up at the same place.
But I want to make sure that I understood
your question also, with due respect to you, Justice
Ginsburg, because what I was talking about was 10 years under
(A)(iii), of course, is a sentencing factor, as this Court
held in Dean, whereas under (B)(i), the same length of a
sentence might be an element. That was a matter -- that
was a statutory answer, and I think, as a matter of
statutory construction, which is, of course, the first
thing you're going to address in this case, what we
think we can win on without even reaching the
constitutional questions. And the differences would be,
apart from the same sentence, you have the structural
difference that I've emphasized. You have the tradition.
And let me say a word about tradition, if I
might. The government emphasizes the guidelines and
other kinds of statutes. When this Court applies the
tradition canon that it established in Almendarez-Torres
and Castillo, I don't know why you have to look any
further than Castillo itself to answer the tradition
question. In Jones, as this Court put it, the reason we
look to tradition is because if it's a close case, we’re
going to not assume that Congress intended a radical
departure from past practice. Well, the past practice
here is absolutely unequivocal. This Court held in
Castillo, 9-0, that Congress intended this to be an
element.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the Court's --
the Court's opinion in Castillo quite carefully noted
that it wasn't addressing this statute. I think it's a
little bit of a bait-and-switch to say that, well,
Castillo decides this case.
MR. FISHER: I don't contend that Castillo
absolutely decides the case. My contention that I was
trying to make is that when this Court looks to
tradition for purposes of construing the new amendments,
that Castillo gives the answer on -- at least on
tradition, at least as applying that particular
question. Because Congress, we know, intended it to be
an element at least until 1998.
But I think that even -- even if you were to
step back from the Castillo analysis itself and the
Castillo factors themselves, you would also, I think, do
well to give -- again, not dispositive, but -- but
careful treatment to Castillo, because Congress steps
in, of course, and amends statutes all the time. They
step in and they amend one portion of a statute, and
while they are at it, we know from the manuals that we've
cited and from the examples in the back of the O'Brien
brief that Congress often, while they’re amending one
part, they reorganize or reword other parts of the
statute.
And this Court, across its statutory
interpretation jurisprudence, within criminal law and
outside, has always said that once we say the law means
something, we're not going to assume that Congress
changed the law unless we get some sort of clear
indication from Congress that it -- that it intended to
change the law.
Now, here, as I think has been emphasized,
but I’ll just reiterate, there’s not a peep of
anything in the legislative history or anything to
suggest that Congress was -- was intending to change the
law here. And, in fact, it's not even a mere silence
case. We know quite clearly and affirmatively that
Congress was intending to do something entirely
different, which was respond to this Court's Bailey
decision.
But even in the language -- and the only
thing I think the Solicitor General even has for it in
this case is the language and structure, which are some
different words and different placement that it can at
least build an argument off of, because the other four
of the five Castillo factors are entirely unchanged.
But even the language, we submit, is a far cry from the
kind of change this Court ought to require before it
does a 180-degree switch as to what it had said the
prior law meant.
Just for purposes of stability in the law,
if nothing else, I think this -- it behooves this Court
to take its prior decisions seriously and to -- and to
engage in a dialogue with Congress that encourages
Congress to be clear when it wants to change what the
prior law is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The prior statute -- which
was 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1), right? That did deal with
short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun,
machinegun, and so forth, but that's -- that provision
didn't say anything about brandishing or discharge.
Where -- what was -- how were they treated under the
prior law?
MR. FISHER: They -- as you say, they were
not in the statute itself. My understanding is that
judges as -- on an ad hoc basis, would have treated
those as sentencing factors.
And what Congress did -- when it came in to
respond to this Court's Bailey decision, I think it
codified all of the different manners of using the gun
in the context of one of these crimes. So it not just
dealt with, yes, possessing ought to be covered, but it
talked about other manners, brandishing and discharging.
In Castillo, this Court emphasized again the big
difference between manner of using a gun and the type of
firearm which lies at the core of this offense.
If I would turn -- if I would leave the
Court with nothing else, let me emphasize again to the
Court the difference between this statute, which I think
the government wants you to think is no different in
intent, effect, or operation than the two that this
Court prior -- dealt with in Harris, as a matter of both
statutory construction and constitutional law, and in
McMillan, as a matter of constitutional law.
What this Court emphasized in both of those
cases was that there was a preexisting law on the books
that criminalized certain activity. And then a
legislature later stepped in and set a mandatory minimum
for a particular fact that could accompany the crime at
issue. And it did so in a very minor way. For example,
in Pennsylvania, the various crimes covered by the
firearm mandatory minimum in that case gave 10-, 20-year
sentences routinely, and all the Pennsylvania
legislature did was step in and say: If he uses a gun,
we want at least 5 years. And in Harris, as I've
just emphasized, I think, in discussing with
Justice Scalia, the Court dealt with a bump of just 2
years. Again, what judges were already customarily
doing, I think, under the statute.
Here, this is entirely and dramatically
different. Here, the fact allows a sentence -- indeed,
requires a sentence -- that is 20 years longer than
anyone has ever gotten for this conduct at issue. That
is a difference not just -- it's not a minor difference.
It is a categorically different difference that we think
is enough, combined with other principles of statutory
and constitutional interpretation, to -- I'm sorry,
statutory interpretation to resolve this case on the
statute alone.
But if you need to look to the Constitution,
we think that the Sixth Amendment, either as the
bright-line rule articulated in Apprendi dictates that
any fact that allows a greater sentence than the
defendant could otherwise receive is subject to the
Sixth Amendment, or sort of plain, pure due process,
tail-that-wags-the-dog analysis, that this Court
emphasized in McMillan -- either of those would be
enough, and indeed require, a finding of
unconstitutionality here and a finding this Court
can avoid.
And if nothing else, Justice Breyer, I would
say that we think that this case can be resolved on statutory
grounds. We think there are narrower constitutional
arguments that would either require reading it narrowly
or striking it down if you had to, on even narrower
grounds. But if nothing else, then we would ask this
Court to revisit Harris, if necessary.
We don't think it's necessary to resolve the
case for us here, but we think that would be appropriate
if it -- if it needed to get there.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a collateral point:
Does the government have to show, or does the -- don't
you have to find that the machinegun is operable?
MR. FISHER: I assume so, but I don't know
the specific answer to that, Justice Kennedy. What
there is a dispute about, of course, is whether the --
if it were a sentencing factor, whether the government
has to prove knowledge. And we do emphasize that that
would be an alternative basis for this Court to decide
this case, by saying you at least have to prove
knowledge even if it’s a sentencing factor.
And let me just leave you with this, unless
there are any further questions: The government makes a
couple points in its reply brief suggesting that certain
arguments were not preserved or made properly in this
case. The knowledge argument that I just referred to is
raised in the brief in opposition for Mr. O'Brien at
pages 23 to 25. So under rule 15 of this Court, that
argument was properly presented at the cert stage. You
will also find that argument at pages 34 to 37 of the Joint
Appendix.
Also with respect to the Sixth Amendment
substantive reasonableness as-applied argument, the
government suggests that for some reason, that would be
inappropriate for this Court to reach or rely on.
Again, we disagree. First of all, we can't understand
why it would be inappropriate to reach or rely on that
constitutional argument, whereas it is apparently
appropriate for this Court to address the McMillan
argument or the “overrule Harris” argument. They’re
all three constitutional arguments that are present in
this case. And, again, if there were any doubt they
were raised below, pages 38 and 39 of Mr. Burgess's
First Circuit brief, pages 32 to 35 of Mr. O'Brien's
First Circuit brief, and in the brief in opposition,
which the government, in its reply brief at the cert
stage, responded to without claiming any error or any
waiver problems. So we think absolutely all the
arguments that are made in the blue -- in the red briefs
are clearly before you.
If the Court has any additional questions, I
would be happy to entertain them. Otherwise, I am
prepared to submit the case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Fisher.
Mr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN HORWICH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HORWICH: Thank you.
Justice Kennedy, just to answer your
question: The definition of "firearm" in 921(a)(3)
includes a weapon that is designed to expel a
projectile, so one that can be restored to do so also
qualifies as a firearm for purposes of the statute.
My friend made the comment that brandishing
and discharge would have been treated, under the old
statute, as sentencing factors. But they couldn't be,
because the old statute had determinant sentences, and
brandishing and discharge weren't relevant to it. So
there wouldn't be a higher sentence for those.
And that -- that reveals sort of a basic
flaw in this notion that somehow those can be treated as
sentencing factors, but Congress wasn't embarking on a
general litany of sentencing factors. Congress inserted
those to be sentencing factors, as the Court recognized
in Harris. Then what it did is move the firearm-type
provisions next in line, because that's what it thought
of them as, not as elements. It moved them away. And
then it goes on to recidivism, which is also a sentencing
factor.
So the overall result, then, of the statute
is that it's sort of an instruction manual. The first
thing that comes up is the elements; that's what the
judge uses to charge the jury or take a plea. That
ends. The statute takes up the next topic, which is
sentencing. The judge needs to ascertain the limits of
his discretion. And then the statute ends with some
technical considerations.
That -- that approach is entirely in line
with the sentencing factor tradition, and that's --
that seems to be what Congress intended. But my friend's
understanding of the statute is sort of this disorganized
jumble, and he's making very much of the idea that when
Congress revises a statute, it tries to confront -- it
tries to make it better, on his view.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything
other -- do we have anything other than the statute
itself? When I looked at the statute itself, I thought,
well, all that's happened here is nobody's thought of
this issue at all; nobody's read Castillo. What really
happened is somebody in the legislative drafting section
was focusing on what he said they were focusing on,
Bailey, and then they have a form manual. So they
followed the form manual.
Now, is there anything to suggest that isn't
what happened?
MR. HORWICH: Well, there is no legislative
history, but there is the fact that the form manual says
if you’re going to embark on this, here are some ideas
for how to do it. But it doesn't tell you -- it does
not tell Congress substantively what it should do.
Someone had to make a choice to write that introductory
language, "a person convicted of a violation." And that
is what Congress passed, and so Congress intended that
those things, firearm type, that follow that are
relevant after the person has been convicted of a
violation.
One final answer to your question
Justice Scalia, about the life maximum. This Court
held -- in Custis v. United States interpreted the same
language, “not less than” a certain number of years.
That's in 924(e) of the Armed Career Criminal Act. The
Court held that to have a life maximum sentence there.
So I think the same would apply -- the same would apply
here.
And so the final thing I would want the
Court to take away then from this is that Congress is
using firearm type to channel a sentencing judge's
discretion. The life maximum exists in all cases.
There have been cases sentenced up to life even where
that was far above the minimum. And when Congress does
that, it uses a sentencing factor. It doesn't create
greater and lesser included offenses for the jury; it
does it by addressing the person who is in charge of
sentencing, which is the judge, and giving him a rule of
decision. That's what the text and the structure
indicate here and that's what the Court should hold.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
