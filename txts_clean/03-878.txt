CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument

Benitez v. Rozos.
Mr. Kneedler.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
These cases implicate the fundamental power of
the United States to protect its borders by excluding
aliens who arrive at its borders, but are found under the
law not to qualify for admission.
This Court held more than 100 years ago in
Nishimura Ekiu that the power of a nation to forbid the
entrance of foreigners within its dominions is inherent in
sovereignty and is central to self-preservation. If it
were otherwise, the integrity of the Nation's borders and
its security would be at the mercy of a foreign power who
might choose to foist aliens onto our country or to the
self-help efforts of aliens who might leave another
country coming to our shores. The migration crises
involving Haitians and Cubans over the last 35 years
vividly illustrate the adverse consequences of such a
regime, and events of recent years confirm that the
threats to the Nation's borders and security are not
limited to nearby nations.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But this Court held only 3
years ago that the statute before us here does not permit
the Attorney General to hold the alien indefinitely.
MR. KNEEDLER: The -- the Court addressed one of
the statutes before the Court here. It's -- it's
important I -- I think to recognize another statute and --
that is -- reflects the background principle of this
Court's decision in Mezei. And if I may explain, to do
that.
This Court made clear in Mezei that an alien has
no substantive due process right to enter the United
States when the executive branch has determined, under the
law, that he has no right to enter the United States. The
relevant --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Kneedler, recognizing
that distinction, is that a distinction drawn by the
statute that's before us?
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, I believe it is, but it --
but -- but first of all, there is another statute which is
highly relevant to this, and that is 1182(d)(5)(A), the
parole statute. It is the parole statute that -- that has
long governed whether an alien who arrives at our shores
and has not been shown to be admissible may enter the
United -- may enter the United States. The parole statute
is set forth at petition appendix 3a -- excuse me -- page
3a of our brief. That is the only statute that
affirmatively authorizes aliens to enter the United
States. That statute is -- obviously confers no rights.
It is written entirely in terms of the discretion of the
Attorney General, now the Secretary of Homeland Security.
It says the Attorney -- the Secretary may, in his
discretion, temporarily under conditions that he
prescribes and for urgent and humanitarian reasons, parole
an alien into the United States. But it says that parole
does not constitute an admission, and it may be revoked at
any time when the Secretary in his opinion concludes that
the purposes of the parole have been satisfied.
JUSTICE BREYER: So are you -- are you arguing
now that -- that (5)(A) -- (d)(5)(A), is the statute under
which you are detaining him and that 1231(a)(6) has
nothing to do with the case?
MR. KNEEDLER: No. They -- they are independent
authorities for the detention --
JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so you're arguing -- then
you are. You're saying -- this is coming to me a little
bit anew. I perhaps didn't read it carefully enough. But
I thought -- let's assume you lose on 1231(a)(6), that I
can't think of a way. Let's assume that I can't think of
a way of applying the same words to your alien to mean
something different than were applied to the alien who was
in Zadvydas. Suppose you lose on that point.
Now you're saying, well, independently of that,
we have a different statute under which we can detain him,
namely 1182(d)(5)(A). Is that --
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, absolutely, and the -- and
the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now is that argument --
I mean, I'm sorry that I --
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and we -- we make -- we do
make that argument in our brief.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and that -- and so is that
made in the courts below and everything that they're doing
in the cases --
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We made it at -- we made it
in both courts below, and we -- and we think it's clear
from the background of -- of this statute that it does --
that it does confer independent authority.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But this statute just -- just
goes in a circle because it ends. The way end -- (A) ends
is that after revoking the parole, the alien shall
forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which
he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to
be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other
applicant for admission to the United States, which refers
you back to -- to 1231(a)(6).
MR. KNEEDLER: No. With respect, it doesn't.
1231(a)(6) is an additional -- on its face is an
additional grant of detention authority. It is not -- but
whereas, the -- the parole authority which -- which for
years until --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this shall continue to be
dealt with in the same manner as that of any other
applicant --
MR. KNEEDLER: And an --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Dealt with includes, it seems
to me, 1231(a)(6).
MR. KNEEDLER: An applicant for admission
includes anyone who has been found not to be admissible to
the United States. 8 U.S.C. 1225(a)(1) provides that any
-- any alien in the United States who has not
affirmatively been found to be admissible is an applicant
for admission. And the -- the statutes dealing with
applicants for admission or aliens who arrive at our shore
establish that detention, even indefinite detention, is --
is not only permitted, but required unless the Secretary
releases someone.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How would that -- how would
that apply to someone who hasn't gotten parole, hasn't
gotten any permission, who snuck across the border?
That's one of the pieces of this that's incomprehensible,
that you are suggesting someone can be detained
indefinitely who we allowed in temporarily, but such
treatment could not occur with respect to somebody that
had no permission at any time to be here.
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Well, the -- the parole
statute -- if someone was taken into custody, the parole
-- who had sneaked across the border, that person, under
the 1996 revisions, is an applicant for -- for admission,
and the parole statute would govern that.
As a constitutional matter, and particularly
with respect to procedural due process, the Court has
suggested in a number of its cases that there may be a
difference between somebody who arrives at our borders and
-- and is stopped and somebody who -- who sneaks through.
At least as a procedural matter, the Government would have
to establish that he has no right to be here. But --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But may I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, are -- are you saying
that if an alien on -- who seeks admission and is denied
admission and is at Ellis Island or the JKF Airport, that
the Attorney General is -- does not have to consult
1231(a)(6)?
MR. KNEEDLER: No. We believe the parole
statute furnishes independent authority --
JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say -- I mean,
the reason I guess I missed it is because when I looked at
your table of contents and elsewhere in the brief, it
seems phrased totally in terms of 1231(a)(6). That's the
heading. Each argument seems to support that. And then
on page -- you know, when you refer to this, I guess on
page 26, you're talking in a section about what 1231 must
be because of the structure of it. And then you refer to
other provisions such as the one you're now mentioning. I
just didn't pick up that it was a totally independent
basis.
MR. KNEEDLER: Right. And -- and if I may, the
-- the special statutes that govern the parole of Mariel
Cubans that we reproduce in the appendix to our brief at
212.12 were promulgated in 1987 before 1231(a)(6) was
enacted in 1996.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but where does it
say that? I'd like to just glance at it even now. Where
does it say that in your brief, that it's a totally
independent basis?
MR. KNEEDLER: On page 12 -- 26 to 27.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I read and it was
in a structure called the statutory and -- text and
structure support the Secretary's detention authority,
which is under a bigger heading saying the text,
structure, and history of section 1231(a)(6) confirm the
executive branch's authority.
MR. KNEEDLER: I should -- I should also --
JUSTICE BREYER: So perhaps I could be forgiven
for not understanding --
MR. KNEEDLER: And -- and I should also point
out that -- that in -- in our response to the petition in
the Benitez petition, we expressly -- we expressly argued
that 1182(d)(5)(A) is an independent source of authority.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if -- if there's a statute
that directs you with reference to a class, that statute
is applicable, and this person is within that class. So
how can you tell us we can't go or that we needn't go to
1231?
MR. KNEEDLER: My -- my point is that's not the
exclusive basis. I'm not saying that it's inapplicable to
this category. But --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it might be exclusive
constitutionally, but the Congress has acted.
MR. KNEEDLER: Or -- or --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And once it's acted, you're
controlled.
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, or -- or -- but -- but what
Congress -- if I may go back to the parole statute, before
1231(a)(6) was enacted, the only statute that governed the
detention and the release of aliens arriving at our
shores, what used to be called excludable aliens, was the
parole statute. That provision -- until the aliens before
this Court were ordered --
JUSTICE SCALIA: By which you mean -- parole
statute, by which you mean?
MR. KNEEDLER: 1182(d)(5)(A). Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.
MR. KNEEDLER: And until there is an order of
exclusion, even now the parole statute is the only statute
that governs the detention and release of the alien. And
I think it would be impossible to read into 1182(d)(5)(A)
any 6-month limitation or any limitation at all on how
long someone can be detained because that statute sets up
a presumption of custody with release only in the
discretion of the Attorney General, or now the Secretary
of -- of Homeland Security.
JUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you there, Mr.
Kneedler? Because I mean, the question is whether
constitutionally we should respect that presumption. And
-- and my -- my question basically is this. I can
perfectly well understand and I can understand the -- the
argument for respecting that presumption. When you're
dealing with excluded aliens who are in a literal
territorial sense within the border but are never allowed,
in effect, beyond a point of initial custody, the ones who
are kept at Ellis Island or wherever one may -- may keep
them.
It is difficult, however, I -- I think to accept
what has been called the -- the fiction of custody. When
we are dealing with individuals who, although absolutely
excludable, were nonetheless welcomed into the United
States by a public announcement of the President of the
United States, have been allowed into the American
population, just as clearly and as readily as they would
have been under any other protocol of admission -- and I
guess in this case for something like 20 years -- isn't
there a point at which the -- the fiction of exclusion
simply cannot be accepted for constitutional purposes?
MR. KNEEDLER: There are a number of responses
to that. First, as a factual matter, with respect to
welcoming into the United States, what gets cited for that
proposition is a statement by President Carter in May 5 of
1980. 10 days later, before the aliens in this case came
to this country, he made clear that people should not do
this. He encouraged people not to go to Cuba. The INS
brought enforcement actions against people who went there.
There were criminal prosecutions that were brought. So
people were not encouraged to come to the United States in
this way.
With respect to the regime that you say -- I
believe you said they're -- they're admitted just like
under any other regime. That is not correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, factually. They're
allowed into the country. You know, they can get jobs,
own property, et cetera.
MR. KNEEDLER: They were allowed into the
country under the parole statute that I just read, which
makes -- which makes it clear that they are admitted not
-- not in a way that confers any rights on them, but they
are admitted in the interest of the United States for
public benefits under circumstances which make clear that
it is not an admission and that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I realize but they are
admitted in the sense that they say, okay, you can come in
and you can do these things, but you get no -- in effect,
you get no vested right. We can take it away like that.
MR. KNEEDLER: No -- no vested right to come
into the United States. It is, in effect, a revocable --
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But otherwise --
otherwise they are treated like any other class of aliens
who are admitted into the United States. They are subject
to this condition. The United States makes that clear,
but they nonetheless can be in the country and do in the
country what other aliens can do.
MR. KNEEDLER: At the sufferance of the United
States.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I know. Subject to that
condition.
MR. KNEEDLER: And -- and the question we have
here is when the -- when and if the United States,
pursuant to this statute, decides no longer to suffer the
aliens being at large, but instead return them to the
border, in effect, or return them to detention, this
statute makes clear that that -- that whatever practical
experience they have had at large in the country is always
subject to revocation --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- I realize that, but
the problem is you've got a Due Process Clause that talks
about persons not citizens. Maybe I can understand the --
the fiction that says it doesn't apply to these persons
if, for practical purposes, we stop them at the border and
we don't let them into society. Once we do let them into
society, whether we say it's subject to this condition it
can be revoked or not, I find it difficult to see a
constitutional warrant for drawing the line that you want
us to draw.
MR. KNEEDLER: This Court has always treated as
the same the custody of an alien who arrives at the border
and has not been admitted, whether that person stays on
the boat, goes to Ellis Island, which the Court said was
not an entry that gave somebody constitutional rights to
come here. In the Kaplan v. Tod case, you had the example
of a person who was paroled for 9 years and regarded as
not being in the United States. And what the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You're giving me prior
examples, but the issue here is should we continue to
respect that -- what has been called that fiction as to
people who are allowed into the country and are allowed to
move around like other aliens and, indeed, and by and
large like citizens.
MR. KNEEDLER: With respect, I think it is not
-- it is not a fiction with respect to the constitutional
issue because there's a critical difference between, for
example, a lawful permanent resident -- a person does not
acquire lawful permanent resident status by something like
adverse possession, by living in the United States for a
long period of time. It is an affirmative grant of status
for permission to reside permanently in the United States.
It is a grant of a status --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which can be revoked. Which
can be revoked, and that's the -- the distinction that
seems to me strange. When somebody commits a deportable
offense, they are stripped of whatever right they had to
be here. They are, it seems to me, in the same boat as
someone who is excludable. They -- they do -- do not have
any right to remain no more than a parolee has. We have
taken away their right to remain. So it seems to me that
they have no status anymore based on a prior admission
that we have removed from them.
MR. KNEEDLER: This Court -- this Court thought
otherwise in -- in Zadvydas 3 years ago where it drew a
distinction. It said the distinction between someone who
has never entered the country and someone who has effected
an entry --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's true. That's true.
Absolutely we did.
And also, I'll assume for argument's sake that
you're completely right on the constitutional point.
That's just for argument's sake. But assume you are. So
there's all kinds of constitutional difference.
Still, I don't see how to read the statute one
way for one group of people and another way for another.
The statutory words in Zadvydas, the words that the
Attorney General may detain this individual beyond the
removal period, are read in Zadvydas to mean beyond the
removal period -- may detain beyond the removal period
means for a reasonable time, presumably 6 months,
presumptively, related -- reasonable time related to the
purpose of the statute which is to find a country willing
to accept them. Okay?
Now, I haven't found a single case of this Court
where you interpret these complicated words one way for
one and another way for another. My law clerk found a
couple of cases, Communications Work v. Bett and
Machinists v. Street, where in Bett particularly the Court
strongly implies the contrary. It says you can't read
words differently just because we interpreted in one --
you know, one statute, they were interpreted in light of
constitutional considerations, and now we have -- those
constitutional considerations aren't here, but it's the
same words. You have to apply it the same.
MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but, with respect, the
Court did not construe any word in this statute to impose
the limitation that you're describing. The -- the way the
Court posed the question was does it -- does it
affirmatively grant a power for detention of these aliens
in these circumstances. At the very beginning of the
Court's opinion, the Court put to one side --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's an interpretation.
MR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me?
JUSTICE SCALIA: It says -- that's an
interpretation.
MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It says the statute does not
confer power to hold beyond a reasonable period.
MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but the -- the mode of
analysis of the Court -- it starts with the introduction
to the Court's opinion, and this is at page 682. It says
-- of -- of Zadvydas. We deal here with aliens who are
admitted, aliens who have not yet --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes. That's right.
MR. KNEEDLER: No. But -- but that -- that's
setting the Court -- the case up. But then what the Court
says, in terms of how it interprets the statute, we
construe the statute to contain an implicit reasonable
time limitation, the application of which is subject to
Federal court review. Well, what is a reasonable time
depends upon the circumstances.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- well, yes, but what --
what -- we put in the presumptively 6 months, but we said
in our view the statute, read in light of the
Constitution's demands, limits an alien's post-removal
period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring
about that alien's removal from the United States. It
does not permit indefinite detention interpreting it to
avoid constitutional threat. We include that once removal
is no longer reasonably foreseeable, continued detention
is no longer authorized by statute.
Now, I don't know what those sentences are doing
unless they're interpreting the words I mentioned. And
then later in the opinion, we say it's presumptively --
MR. KNEEDLER: No. What -- what --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- not always, but
presumptively 6 months.
MR. KNEEDLER: What -- what the -- what the
Court was doing was -- the -- the standard that the Court
announced at the beginning of its opinion was a reasonable
-- a reasonable time limitation, the application of which
is subject to court review. As applied to permanent
resident aliens, the Court saw a -- a constitutional
problem and, in that situation, came up with a presumptive
6-month rule.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it interpreted the
statute as doing it. Now, that brings me back to the
original question.
MR. KNEEDLER: No. No, I don't believe -- with
-- with respect, what -- what I believe the Court said was
that there is a reasonable time limitation. And given the
-- given the distinction that runs throughout immigration
laws, this Court said at page 2500 of the Supreme Court
Reports in this decision, the distinction between aliens
who arrive at our borders and are governed by Mezei, as
opposed to people who enter, runs throughout our
immigration law, I would think that it would run
throughout 1231(a)(6).
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. I can -- I can
agree with you that the different classes are going to
implicate different considerations on what is reasonable.
But you, as I understand it, go the further step and say
there is a presumption, and perhaps an irrebuttable
presumption, that in the case of the -- the legally
excluded, even though they are, in fact, in the country,
the -- the presumptive reasonable period is forever.
MR. KNEEDLER: Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And that's where -- it's that
stretch that's giving us the trouble.
MR. KNEEDLER: And -- first of all, the Court
doesn't have to decide that in this case because we have a
regime where each of the aliens before this Court, came
here, was paroled --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's true, but we've got to
say something.
MR. KNEEDLER: But if -- if I may go to the
Mezei case, what the Court said there is that the
detention of the alien on Ellis Island was effectuating
his exclusion. The two cannot be distinguished from one
another.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Kneedler, do you
mind telling us whether the record shows where Martinez
and Benitez are now? Where are they?
MR. KNEEDLER: Benitez has been released to a
half-way house. We sent the Court a letter --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That's what I thought.
MR. KNEEDLER: -- last week showing that the
review process under these regulations actually works.
It's been working for 15 years. And as we explain in our
brief, more than 9,000 people have been granted parole
here.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So is that case basically
moot? Benitez's?
MR. KNEEDLER: He hasn't been -- he hasn't been
-- I think he's still in -- in custody. Whether -- if --
if he -- if he completes that and is released, a question
of mootness may arise at that point.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Where's Martinez?
MR. KNEEDLER: Martinez was released pursuant to
the court -- district court order almost 2 years ago, and
he's -- he's now at large under an order of supervision.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, if I can continue for
just a moment and then I'll stop. There is a new statute,
1226(a) of title 8, part of the Patriot Act, which allows
detention of aliens who threaten our safety or security.
Presumably that is an option if either of these people is
seen to do that.
MR. KNEEDLER: If -- if there's an -- if there
is an individualized reason to believe that an alien would
be a terrorist or -- or a threat to the security in that
respect, but the threat to the --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And that's available, is it
not?
MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that's available, but the
threat to the national security here is much larger than
that. If -- again, if we go back to the immigration
crises involving Haiti and Cuba, there -- there is a
threat to the national security when another nation can
foist aliens onto our shores, and -- and --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you about --
MR. KNEEDLER: -- if the United States had no
ability to -- to deflect --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a
question, forgetting the statutes for a moment -- I --
which we've already covered at some length? Just going to
your constitutional position, it's clear that a person
who's not been admitted and has been paroled could be
excluded forthwith, summarily, and so forth because he's
never been admitted. But does that person have any
protection under the Constitution? Could we shoot him?
MR. KNEEDLER: No, no, surely. What -- the --
the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Then what is the protection
under the Constitution that deals -- is it the Due Process
Clause?
MR. KNEEDLER: Whatever right -- in -- in a
criminal prosecution the Bill of Rights would apply to
that person.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is he -- is he a person within
the meaning --
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We -- our position is not
that he's -- not that he's not a person. The question is
what -- is what process is due.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And is he a person who has a
right to liberty, entitled to some protection, very, very,
very minimal, but there is some protection to that -- that
individual.
MR. KNEEDLER: It -- depending upon the context.
The one protection for liberty he does --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the context is he got
off a boat. We couldn't -- but Cuba won't take him back
or -- or whatever -- wherever he came from. They can't.
And the only thing we can do to keep him out of the
country is to keep him in jail.
MR. KNEEDLER: He has no substantive due process
right to be released into the United States.
JUSTICE STEVENS: He -- he doesn't have a right
to be released. But -- but you do not contend that we
could kill him.
MR. KNEEDLER: No, absolutely not. Absolutely
not.
JUSTICE STEVENS: He does have some -- some
minimal protection under the Constitution.
MR. KNEEDLER: Absolutely not. The formulation
-- and this was used in -- in the Court's decision in
Landon v. Plasencia. The -- the question is there are no
constitutional rights in connection with his admission to
the United States. And admission means, I think, both
formal granted admission and practical admission or entry.
A person cannot --
JUSTICE BREYER: A person who runs in illegally,
a person who crosses the border illegally, say, from
Mexico is entitled to these rights when you catch him.
MR. KNEEDLER: He's entitled to procedural due
process rights. We don't believe he -- that person has
any more substantive due process right to remain at large
in the United States.
JUSTICE BREYER: But you -- you -- I thought
there was a reg of the INS.
MR. KNEEDLER: No. With -- with --
JUSTICE BREYER: Am I not right?
MR. KNEEDLER: With -- with respect to the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Tell me if I'm right.
MR. KNEEDLER: With respect to the regulations,
but --
JUSTICE BREYER: Can I say what it is?
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, I'm sorry.
JUSTICE BREYER: I thought there was a reg -- to
be sure we're talking about the same thing -- where the
INS has said that Zadvydas applies to individuals who run
into the United States illegally from Mexico. Am I right
about that?
MR. KNEEDLER: The -- the INS has -- or now DHS
has applied it. I -- I don't know that there's an
analysis in there that says Zadvydas requires it. I don't
think the -- either the statute or particularly the
Constitution would give somebody who sneaks across our
border a right to remain here, a substantive due process
right to be here. Maybe procedural rights would be
different, but a substantive --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is that the current
INS --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, may I -- may I
try to get in the question I did earlier? Is -- is 8
U.S.C., section 1182(d)(5) -- was -- was that applicable
in Zadvydas, as it's applicable here?
MR. KNEEDLER: No, because those were lawful
permanent residents whose -- whose lawful permanent
residency had -- had -- they came in under a grant of
lawful permanent residency.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So this is a new string to your
bow in this case.
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, because these aliens entered
the United States only --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wouldn't -- it
wouldn't apply to the illegal alien because it's a statute
that governs parole and they're not paroled into the
United States.
MR. KNEEDLER: But someone -- someone who would
be picked up would be an applicant for admission and could
be released under this -- under this statute. But -- but
focusing here on the people excluded at the border --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does that --
MR. KNEEDLER: -- this is the only way someone
could --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does that make that
person, the illegal entrant, a parolee?
MR. KNEEDLER: He would be an applicant for
admission, and the -- I -- I believe -- I believe I'm
correct on that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose he says, I don't want
to apply for admission. I just don't want to be locked
up.
MR. KNEEDLER: The act treats him as an
applicant for admission under 1225(a)(1).
Mr. Chief Justice, if I may
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.
Kneedler.
Ms. Dahl, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE S. DAHL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT MARTINEZ
MS. DAHL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
Because the same words mean the same thing in
the same statute, this Court need not reach the
constitutional questions presented by the indefinite
detention of inadmissible as opposed to deportable aliens.
Without going to questions of constitutional doubt, there
are three reasons why this Court should hold that section
1231(a)(6) treats inadmissible aliens the same as it
treats deportable aliens.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get to that, do you
think that that's the only statute applicable here? What
about 1182(d)(5)? What's your response to the
Government's assertion that that's an independent basis?
MS. DAHL: Justice Scalia, I don't believe it
provides an independent basis for detention. The
immigration law works together in it's various elements,
and section 1182, when parole is revoked, treats the alien
then as an applicant for admission, and section 1229
places the applicant for admission into removal
proceedings.
The Government did not obtain a ruling on that
argument from the Ninth Circuit, although it made
reference to 1182 in its motions to stay the briefing
schedule. It ultimately conceded that this case was
controlled by Lin Guo Xi, which was a statutory
construction of 1231(a)(6), and cert was granted on the
1231(a)(6) issue only.
The reading of the statute that we proffer, that
the same words mean the same meaning, is consistent with
the overall changes Congress made in 1996 in IIRIRA when
it eliminated the category of excludable aliens and
replaced it with a single, broader category, now called
removable aliens, that embraces both inadmissible and
deportable aliens.
Third, Congress knows how to provide for
indefinite detention when it wants to.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, how do you
explain then, Ms. Dahl, the language in the Court's
Zadvydas opinion that had, were we dealing with, in
effect, off-shore aliens, this would be a much different case?
MS. DAHL: I believe it would present a
different question, but the constitutional issues
presented by indefinite detention remain. The Court
doesn't need to reach those --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So you say that a
person, even though they're not lawfully admitted into the
United States, still couldn't be indefinitely detained.
MS. DAHL: Yes, Your Honor, that is our -- our
point precisely. The Government was not correct when it
said that it -- that this Court has always treated
excludable aliens the same. In a case that was a
contemporary of the Mezei decision, Kwong Hai Chew, cited
at page 45 of our brief, the Court found that an
excludable entrant on Ellis Island was entitled to --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, the Government
distinguishes that case. What do you make of their
distinction?
MS. DAHL: We disagree. I think that it shows
that the Court will consider length of time in the country
in determining what amount of due process is required.
Now, the plain language of the statute of
1231(a)(6) requires the same treatment between
inadmissible and deportable aliens. Where there's no
difference in the language that Congress has used, this
Court can draw no distinctions.
There is a presumption that Congress expects its
statutes to be read in the same manner as the Supreme
Court's interpretation, and because of the
interrelationship between the parole statute and the
revocation proceedings and removability proceedings,
there's no reason for this Court to resort to the 1182
statute to provide the authority that the Government
seeks. The relevant authority is section 1231(a)(6).
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what do you think we
should do with the 1182? Because suppose you prevail on
your argument that it's the same statute, the same word,
it can't be construed differently under 12-whatever, and
the Government says fine. We now go to the other string
in our bow and we continue to detain this person on the
basis of 1182(d)(5)(A).
MS. DAHL: Well, the 1182(d)(5)(A) doesn't
provide for indefinite detention. What it provides is
that upon revocation of parole, the alien is placed into
removal proceedings. Once the removal proceedings have
been determined and a final order of removal is entered,
1231(a) requires removal within 90 days, and failing that,
the appropriate -- the relevant statutory provision is
1231(a)(6). That says that the alien may be detained
beyond the removal period and then, if released, subjected
to conditions of supervision. 1231 is the only statutory
authority for post-removal period detention. Parole deals
with entry and 1231(a)(6) --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but you haven't
answered, I think, the question of whether the Government
is entitled in this case, if we dispose of the 1231
question, to resort to the other statute.
MS. DAHL: I don't think that the Court could
carve out a statute and use it in a way contrary to the
way it functions in the immigration scheme and make
superfluous or irrelevant a more express, more detailed
statutory provision.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what you're saying is
that even if 1182 comes first, 1231 comes second.
MS. DAHL: Precisely, Your Honor. And I don't
think that the Government could revoke parole and then
suspend proceedings to determine the admissibility of a
parolee indefinitely.
JUSTICE BREYER: But still, is this another --
could -- could we do this? I noticed that -- that your --
the petition for cert in Benitez has two questions, both
of which are about interpreting 1231(a)(6). The
Government's petition, though not its brief -- the
Government's petition in Crawford says the question
presented is whether 1231(a)(6) in Zadvydas compelled a
release. So this other -- this other matter is a totally
-- seen as a totally separate ground. Perhaps the thing
to do is we send it back, and if they want to raise it,
they can raise it, and it would be up to the circuit to
decide whether they had preserved it or not preserved it.
Is that -- is that a sensible thing?
MS. DAHL: I don't think so because I don't
think that 1182 allows the interpretation that the
Government --
JUSTICE BREYER: And that's your view of -- of
what 1182 means, and they're going to have a different
view. If they want to argue their different view, they
could do it in the Ninth Circuit. If they've waived it,
they've waived it, and that's up to them, not up to us.
MS. DAHL: What the Ninth Circuit found, though,
in questions of an inadmissible alien, that this Court's
construction of 1231(a)(6) in Zadvydas applied and there
would be no need for resort to any other statute.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask if you believe the
supervision after the 90-day period covered in
subparagraph 3 -- is there -- can that continue
indefinitely in your view?
MS. DAHL: Yes. While the alien is awaiting
removal, he is subject to supervision conditions that will
safeguard the Government's interests, and for as long as
he is waiting, he is under supervision.
It's those supervision conditions that
distinguish this case from the situation where the
Government is finding national security risks. That --
Congress has expressly provided for the indefinite
detention of people whom the Attorney General certifies as
presenting risks to national security.
It's also the presence of a national security
risk that distinguishes this case from the Mezei decision.
I think that the Government makes more of that decision
than needs to be made in order to find that Mr. Benitez
and Mr. Martinez are in different situations. They were
allowed into this country. They have lived here for 24
years, and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How long had the -- the
detainee in, however you pronounce it, Mezei lived in the
United States?
MS. DAHL: Mr. Mezei had been in the United
States for 25 years before he left, and he was gone for an
extended period of time. When he sought to return, he was
treated as if he were an initial entrant, and the
Government, citing national security, excluded him without
a hearing and refused to disclose the evidence that was
the basis for the exclusion. He challenged that and
wanted a hearing and wanted the Attorney General to be
required to disclose the evidence. The Court found that
his release into the community itself would present a
security risk and therefore sustained the denial of the
hearing and the detention of Mr. Mezei.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I don't think it really
said they -- they found there was a security risk. They
-- they held the Government did not have to explain
because the man had no right to come in.
MS. DAHL: That's correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What's -- what's your best
answer to the Government's argument that unless you treat
this case differently from Zadvydas, at least for purposes
of reasonable time or reasonable interest, which affects
time, the United States is basically defenseless against
countries that -- that want to dump undesirable aliens and
force them into the United States?
MS. DAHL: I don't think that applying the
statute, as it's written, leaves the Government
defenseless.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Because.
MS. DAHL: Congress can pass another statute, if
it needs to, and the Government --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's defenseless under the
present law?
MS. DAHL: I disagree. We have --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is the defense?
MS. DAHL: We have very effective means of
interdicting --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What are they?
MS. DAHL: Well, after the Mariel boatlift, the
Government changed its policy and now intercepts people
who are coming from Cuba by boat and detains them at
Guantanamo Bay, does a screening, and has a more effective
repatriation process for people that they do not want to
come in.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to take --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying they can
actually exclude, in practical terms.
MS. DAHL: Yes. That's exactly what --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to take judicial
notice that the Mexican border and American border is
impervious?
(Laughter.)
MS. DAHL: I think that would present a
different question. As the Government acknowledged,
people who come into the country without inspection are
entitled, under the Government regulations, to the
protections under Zadvydas. And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And there's no -- and -- and
there's no answer to Justice Souter's question with regard
to people who -- who -- once they enter that way. Right?
MS. DAHL: Well, the Government has --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Except a new statute.
MS. DAHL: Well, Congress has -- has, by
definition, treated those people as inadmissible aliens
who are subject to removal proceedings. And the
interdiction methods are -- they're purely political
decisions that the Government needs to make.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But they -- in any case, those
individuals are not the subject of sort of dumping action
by their own governments.
MS. DAHL: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Does the -- Congress has passed
a special statute with respect to terrorism, hasn't it,
where it does authorize detention of any of these people
who are engaged in terrorism. Now, I don't know how
that's defined. Is that defined to relieve in a way
that's broad enough to relieve some of the problem?
MS. DAHL: Well, if -- well, first of all, the
Government has the ability to detain, pending the removal
proceedings, of people who are trying to come into the
country. The question becomes if they can't be
repatriated. Now, the Patriot Act in 1226(a) does allow,
in instances of national security, for the Attorney
General to indefinitely detain. Now, importantly, that
statute provides for procedural protections and judicial
review, that is absent from --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But are -- are the
people here charged with any sort of terrorist activities?
They were committed -- convicted of crimes, but I -- I
didn't think they were connected with terrorist
activities.
MS. DAHL: That's correct. The Government has
not made any allegation that there's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Just normal, harmless
criminals.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right?
(Laughter.)
MS. DAHL: Their release from prison presents
the same issues that the release of any person who has
served the sentences that were imposed after the
commission of a crime.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, except that with
aliens, they can be deported, whereas a citizen can't be,
upon release from prison.
MS. DAHL: That's correct. And the conditions
of supervision that the Government can impose are much
lengthier and could be even more onerous than the kinds of
supervision conditions after prison that the Government
could impose on its citizens.
In this case, Mr. Martinez and Mr. Zadvydas both
received permission to live here. Both committed crimes.
Both served their sentences and both were ordered removed.
Nothing in section 1231(a)(6) warrants making Mr. Martinez
wait for removal in a Federal prison perhaps for the rest
of his life, while Mr. Zadvydas awaits removal after
having been released --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I thought the other person
was named Benitez. I thought we had Zadvydas in the other
case. Do we have two, a Martinez and a Benitez, here?
MS. DAHL: Yes, Your Honor. I was drawing a
comparison between the situation with Mr. Zadvydas and Mr.
Martinez.
Detention, of course, needs to be reasonably
related to its purpose. Here removal cannot be achieved.
So detention for that purpose becomes arbitrary and
punitive, and we'd ask the Court to affirm the grant of
habeas corpus and Mr. Martinez's release on supervision
conditions.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Dahl.
Mr. Mills, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. MILLS
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BENITEZ
MR. MILLS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
I think that we have lost sight of the statutory
scheme that applies here. Section 1182(d)(5)(A) is not a
detention statute. It's clearly not preserved as an
initial matter. It was not in the answer to either habeas
petition. The justification given in the district court
in both cases was 1231(a)(6).
But, Justice Breyer, there is no need to remand
this case because a clear, simple reading of the
immigration statutes demonstrates that 1182 is not a
detention statute. You have to go through the process,
and I attempted to do this in my reply brief, but I think
I can do it a little bit more clearly for the Court this
morning.
When an alien first arrives, he's an applicant
for admission. Section 1225(b)(2)(A) of title 8, United
States Code says an applicant for admission -- any
applicant for admission shall be detained until the
removal proceeding unless it is clear, beyond any doubt,
that they are entitled to come in. So all aliens, when
they apply -- that's the detention statute that initially
applies, 1225(b)(2)(A). They are to be detained until
there is a removal proceeding. The removal proceeding,
which is governed by 1229(a)(1) -- I'm sorry -- 1226(a) --
it is 1229(a) -- is to determine whether the alien is
admissible or not, whether they should come in or whether
they must be removed. So 1225(b)(2)(A) says detain until
that point.
1182(d)(5)(A) then comes in to authorize the
Government to stop that process for humanitarian reasons
and parole an alien in. We won't have the removal
process. We're going to -- we -- we're going to get out
of the detention in 1225(b)(2)(A), and we're going to let
you out on parole, which is discretionary. That's
1182(d)(5)(A).
If at any time, we in our discretion think it is
no longer appropriate to keep you on parole, we can revoke
that parole, and the statute 1182(d)(5)(A) says once
parole is revoked, the alien is treated as, quote, any
other applicant for admission. So you go back to
1225(b)(2)(A), which says detain them until the removal
proceeding.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you -- you skipped a -- a
phrase. It says when the Attorney General is of the
opinion that the purposes of the parole justify nothing
more, the individual shall return or be returned to the
custody from which he began. And their argument is that
custody is different in these cases.
MR. MILLS: That custody is the custody under
1225(b)(2)(A). That is the statute that authorizes the
custody. That's what they're being returned to.
1225(b)(2)(A) is detention until the removal proceedings.
And in the Demore v. Kim case, this case -- this Court
said that even if it's a long time and there aren't other
procedures in place, you can be detained until your
removal order is entered because -- and -- and the
emphasis was there's an end date to that. So there's an
end date to detention under (b)(2)(A), 1225(b)(2)(A), and
it's the removal proceedings.
Section 1231 is the statute that governs removal
and says, okay, now what happens? It says you have to
remove within 90 days, but for certain aliens who've
committed crimes or are inadmissible or are otherwise
determined to be dangerous, we can detain them beyond. It
says may be detained beyond the period. That is the only
statute that authorizes any detention of an alien after a
removal order other than the specific terrorist statute,
1226(a), which was enacted, which does not authorize
indefinite detention. It says -- it has a paragraph
labeled indefinite detention, and it says the Government
shall not indefinitely detain a terrorist alien that it
cannot remove except that if the Government determines --
and -- and it appears to put the burden on the Government
-- that the person is a danger to national security or the
community, it can detain them for another 6 months. And
then you -- you could have indefinite detention, but each
time, each 6 months, the statute provides for review.
So not only do the sneakers, the aliens who
cross across the border in the -- in the dark of night
from Mexico or wherever -- not only do they under the
Government's own admission have the Zadvydas rights, so
too do terrorist aliens by statute. And to suggest that
by some implication Congress has intended to authorize the
indefinite detention of people that we thought we should
welcome into our country, even though we didn't have the
ability under our quota system and under our current
regulations in 1980 to let them in, somehow they have no
rights against indefinite detention.
For the Government to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you -- how do you
answer the Government's argument that this is necessary,
that the United States shouldn't effectively be punished
for being humanitarian, and if we can't hold these people,
if we're forced to let them in, then any rogue nation can
dump anyone it wants on the United States and we can't
stop it?
MR. MILLS: Yes, Your Honor. Justice Ginsburg,
that's their sole policy argument, and frankly, it doesn't
hold water. Just yesterday in the Jama case, the
Government took the position that if Mexico flooded --
flooded our borders with illegal aliens who we could not
detain, we know under their own regulations, if they snuck
in, we couldn't detain them, but if a new Mexican -- there
was a Mexican dictator and he flooded our borders, could
we forcibly repatriate them? And the Government said
absolutely we can. We can go down and put them back in
Mexico. We could do that with the Cubans. We could let
them out the gate at Guantanamo Bay.
If a -- a rogue nation truly invades our country
with its bad aliens, that is an infringement on our
sovereignty, and I think that's an act of war. And I
think the President has all kinds of options: trade
sanctions, go to the United Nations, diplomacy. If it's
really something bad that's going to be a -- a threat to
our national security, I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, you -- you might
wait a while if you went to the United Nations or --
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: -- or to -- I take it
the Government feels you need some sort of a rather
immediate recourse.
MR. MILLS: Sure, and our Government has
demonstrated that it believes in preemptive -- preemptive
action and we can go in and have regime change in Cuba if
it -- if it is such a threat. If it's a political
decision, the purely executive decision, that our national
security is so threatened, they have all kinds of tools.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But this -- this regime is not
sending, you know, an armed flotilla to Florida. They
just --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- they just open their jails
and say, hey, you know, go wherever you want. And these
people say I want to get out of here, and they go to
Florida. You -- you want us --
MR. MILLS: That was less than 1 percent --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to bomb Cuba because of
that.
MR. MILLS: That was less than 1 percent of the
Cubans who came in the Mariel boatlift. That did occur,
and we do have options for dealing with them. We can
return them forcibly. If they don't allow us, that's like
them sending a missile. It's -- we -- we can destroy the
missile. We can't destroy a human being. By punishing a
human being that Castro sends over, we're not sending a
message to Castro. We're not saying, ah, you sent your
prisoners over here and were going to indefinitely detain
them. Mental torture. That will teach you. That's --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What you -- what you mean when
you say we can forcibly return them is literally we can
take them to Guantanamo, take them to the gate, and push
them out?
MR. MILLS: That's one option. If there -- if
the Cuban army is there to prevent us, you know, maybe it
would require some military action that the administration
might decide is not advisable. But those are the options
depending on the size of the threat. So a judicial
interpretation that the statute means the same thing in
all contexts does not deprive the Government of anything.
And I'd like to go back to that if I could.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- maybe I -- I
misunderstood you, but I thought that one of your points
were even assuming that we couldn't send these people back
into Cuba without having a major conflagration, the rogue
dictator is not going to be deterred by our tossing even
into the sea the people that he doesn't want.
MR. MILLS: That -- that is my point. That's
the point that I -- I intend to make, that indefinitely
detaining these people -- that does nothing to a dictator.
That does nothing to deter a dictator. All it means is
we're going to be incurring the huge cost of incarcerating
a large number of people, and if anything, that may
encourage the dictator to do exactly that, or it may
encourage the dictator, instead of sending them to Key
West on boats -- on American boats, to sneak them up on
speed boats or take them through Mexico and sneak them
across the border that's --
JUSTICE BREYER: Anyway, it's a little drastic.
I -- I guess that before this happens, Congress might
enact a statute like the terrorist statute.
MR. MILLS: Exactly. That -- that is exactly
correct, Justice Breyer. And if they think -- whether a
-- a Cuban, a Mariel Cuban, can be put in jail -- and
these are in prison for the rest of their life -- is a
huge policy decision. And this Court should abstain from
putting its voice as -- on to the answer. That is a
decision for Congress in the first place.
In Zadvydas, this Court said the statute doesn't
clearly do that, so we're not going to -- we're not going
to answer that question as to whether it would be
constitutional.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's a policy decision
either way. I -- I suppose if Zadvydas had come out the
other way, the Congress could have responded as well.
MR. MILLS: That's correct. But in -- in this
case, because especially the Zadvydas aliens had clear
constitutional rights, we avoid the question. The
doctrine of constitutional avoidance says the Court
doesn't engage in that. The default is to stay away from
it. If Congress wants to do something that might be
unconstitutional, they can come back and do it and then
the Court will determine whether it's unconstitutional.
Back to the point of whether 1231(a)(6) can mean
something different for the two groups of aliens. Never
before has this Court taken a statute that --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: How do you explain,
Mr. Mills, the language that the Court used, pointing out
how different this kind of a case would have been from the
-- from the Zadvydas case?
MR. MILLS: Sure. My reading of that -- of that
decision, there were two parts of the decision. There was
part one, which examined whether there is a -- or it
determined whether the statute is ambiguous, and part two
is whether there's a constitutional error. It was only in
the part of the decision deciding whether there's a
constitutional problem that the distinction was made. The
distinction makes the difference in whether there's a
problem or not. And maybe there's not a problem for
inadmissible aliens.
So, the Court then concluded in Zadvydas that
because there's a problem, we look at the statute. This
statute could be interpreted to authorize indefinite
detention or not. It's ambiguous. Because we have a
problem, at least with one category, we're going to choose
the -- a safe route.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been a -- a means
of warning Congress off one area, but not the other. That
is to say, just because we think there's a constitutional
doubt here and therefore Congress might be sailing close
to the wind if they tried to overrule our opinion by
statute doesn't mean that Congress couldn't in this other
area alter the result in Zadvydas.
MR. MILLS: I think that that is absolutely a --
a conclusion that can be drawn that Congress --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, I dissented in that
case. So I'm not saying this was a good idea.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: But it -- it's interesting. In
-- in just my -- for my -- my own information, then
Congress did respond. And there were two areas in
Zadvydas that, you know, didn't warn Congress off. One is
the one we're talking about now. The other is terrorism.
And Congress responded in the terrorism matter. Is that
right? But they didn't do anything on the --
MR. MILLS: That's absolutely correct. And
they're responding right now. In the 9/11 Commission
bill, there is a section that's being negotiated as to
whether terrorist aliens who can't be removed because they
would be tortured -- whether they can be indefinitely
detained. And they're looking at the same limiting
language.
One point that I'd like to make that I did not
get to make directly in the brief, but it was raised.
Justice Scalia, you had a question yesterday in the Leocal
case, and it -- it raised an issue that I hadn't looked at
before on whether a statute can be interpreted differently
in a situation where the reason to interpret it is no
longer there. And that's the rule of lenity cases.
And I cited as a supplemental authority the
United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Company, 504 U.S.
505. It's a 1992 decision, and it involved a tax code
provision. And the question is, do we apply the rule of
lenity? And Justice Stevens, in dissent you said no,
because this is a civil case. The rule of lenity doesn't
apply. But a three-judge plurality, an opinion by Justice
Souter, and a two-justice -- two-judge concurrence by
Justice Scalia both agreed that the rule of lenity applied
because the statute applies both in criminal and civil
contexts. And you can't have one meaning in a criminal
context and another in civil.
For the same reason, the rule of constitutional
avoidance should not result in a statute being interpreted
one way when there would be a doubt and another way when
there would not.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the argument
that the statute, in effect, limits the -- our -- our
interpretation limits the -- the detention to a period
reasonably related to the Government's interest in
accomplishing that interest? That interest is different
in -- in the case of -- of aliens who are excluded, if we
accept that class as distinct from all excludables. And
-- and that may allow a much longer period of detention,
among other things, to deter dictators from -- from
dumping. You've given us an answer to what to do if they
dump, but we don't want them to dump in the first place.
That argument stops short of saying we can detain them for
life, but it would support the -- the position that on a
consistent interpretation of the statute, the Government
could detain them longer in the excluded cases than in
others. What's your answer to that?
MR. MILLS: My answer to that is that that might
be a -- a legislative policy decision to make that
distinction. But in 1996, IIRIRA abolished the
distinction between inadmissible and deportable aliens
after they've been ordered removed. Up until that time,
it makes a difference. It makes a difference under the
Constitution. But once they've been ordered removed --
and this was the Government's argument in Zadvydas. Once
they've been ordered removed, regardless of how they got
here in the first place, they no longer have any right to
be here at all and --
JUSTICE SOUTER: There is only one class of
excludables by the Government's own choice. That's --
that's basically your answer.
MR. MILLS: After a removal proceeding, there is
only one class. That is correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
MR. MILLS: If there are no more questions, I
would just ask that the Court reverse in this case.
If there are any mootness concerns about Mr.
Benitez, I would refer the Court to Friends of the
Environment which said that when a challenged practice has
stopped voluntarily, that does not moot a case out in the
Supreme Court unless there's some reason to believe they
won't go at it again. And the Government has asserted
that it can revoke his release at any time for any reason
and detain him indefinitely.
And the suggestion that the fact that he's been
released under the Cuban Review Panel shows that his --
he's been protected is -- is not well taken. He was
determined, when he first was detained in -- in 2001, that
he was eligible under the Cuban Review Panel to be
released. It took 3 years and the week before this case
was argued in the highest court of the land before the
Immigration Service did what its own regulations told it
it had to do.
Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Mills.
Mr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Justice Souter, you're exactly right in terms of
why the statutory construction or statutory application of
the terms in Zadvydas does not control here. The Court's
starting point -- again back to page 682 of its opinion,
it says, we deal here with aliens who were admitted. The
way the Court dealt in the opinion was a matter of
statutory construction, and it did it by reading into the
statute a reasonable time limitation. What is reasonable
for aliens who -- who have been admitted and are subject
to what were called deportation is different from aliens
who were stopped at the border. And in fact, in the -- in
the Court's statutory analysis, it looked to the point
that in the Witkovitz jurisdictional statement referring
to Congress' constitutional doubts about detention of more
than 6 months, those were constitutional doubts about
people who were being deported after having been allowed
to be here. There has never --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What's your -- what's your
answer to Mr. -- Mr. Mills' position that the Government
has, in fact, statutorily waived that distinction by
creating one class of excludables?
MR. KNEEDLER: It -- with respect -- with
respect, it has not. And -- and if I could -- if I could
explain this. This -- going back to Mezei, this Court
held and in fact rejected a very similar argument. The
rationale of the court of appeals in Mezei was that
deportable aliens are subject to an express, not an
implied, 6-month limitation. And the court of appeals
said the aliens in that -- the alien in that case, once he
couldn't be removed to another country, should be released
because the purpose of keeping him to return him to
another country was no longer being served. This Court
rejected that argument, even though there was a statutory
express limitation of 6 months for deportable aliens, held
that an alien who had been on Ellis Island for 2 years did
not have to be released.
In reliance on that decision, Congress passed
the parole statute to leave the release in -- excuse me --
Mezei was after it, but the -- the executive branch has
relied on that rationale.
The Cuban review regulations that are at issue
here have been in place for 15 years under the parole
statute. As Congress well knew, when it acted in 1996,
the -- this program was the subject of many hearings in
Congress. There were cases -- the Barrera case out of the
Ninth Circuit sustained a 10-year detention of a Mariel
Cuban. It is implausible to believe in 1996, when
Congress enacted IIRIRA, that it intended to cut back on
the longstanding power of the executive branch to prevent
hordes of aliens from coming into our country and to
impose an arbitrary 6-month limitation.
I -- I think there's no argument that if an
alien is detained before removal proceedings are begun,
that there is no 6-month limitation. His release is
entirely up to the Attorney General under the parole
regulations. It's -- it's implausible to believe that
once Congress actually enters a formal order of exclusion
or now removal against an alien, the person is no longer
in an ambiguous situation, the executive branch says
you're not eligible, that suddenly that person who has
been formerly found not eligible, would be subject to a 6-
month limitation that did not apply up until '96 and
doesn't even apply until these -- to these aliens until
removal proceedings have been begun.
So the right way to look at this statute as
what's a reasonable time under 1231(a)(6) has to take into
account that historic background of the United States
being able to protect its borders. And there is no
indication whatsoever that Congress intended to overrule
this longstanding program for Mariel Cubans, which has
operated, as I said, for 15 years.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
Kneedler.
The case is submitted.
