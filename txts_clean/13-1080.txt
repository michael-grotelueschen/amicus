CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
next this morning in Case 13-1080, Department of
Transportation v. Association of American Railroads.
Mr. Gannon.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The court of appeals held that Section 207
of PRIIA was unconstitutional because it believed that
the statute constituted an actual delegation of
regulatory authority to a private entity.  And none of
those three things is true about this statute.
First, under Lebron, Amtrak should not be
considered a private corporation for nondelegation
purposes.  Second, the metrics and standards are not
regulatory.  The regulatory effect here comes from the
longstanding statutory preference requirement, which was
enacted by Congress, not Amtrak, and is enforced by an
independent adjudicative agency, the Surface
Transportation Board.  And third --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Go ahead, please.
MR. GANNON:  And third, requiring Amtrak to
approve the metrics and standards before they went into
effect is not a delegation outside the government under
this Court's cases.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think the Lebron
argument, Marsh v. Alabama, the company town case, no
one says that it was a governmental agency.  It was just
exercising governmental-like powers which entitled the
person to exercise free speech.  That's all Lebron can
stand for.  You wouldn't say that Marsh v. Alabama, the
company town, was a governmental agency after reading
that opinion, would you?
MR. GANNON:  No.  I would say that after
reading the opinion in Lebron, that the Court concluded
that Amtrak is a governmental entity for things that
Congress doesn't have control over.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you could say the
same thing about Marsh v. Alabama.
MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that the
difference is that the Court recognized in Lebron that
Amtrak is a government-created corporation that is under
the government's control and that under the government's
control both because of the management control that it
has over it and because it created the purposes for
which Amtrak exists and the things that it has to do.
And then the Court there distinguished between whether Amtrak
is governmental for constitutional purposes that were
beyond Congress's control, but acknowledged that
Congress could control whether Amtrak was governmental
for other purposes, other powers and privileges of
government.
JUSTICE ALITO:  If Amtrak is governmental
for nondelegation purposes, is it also governmental for
appointments clause purposes?
MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that that follows
from the -- the way the Court approached the question
about the PCAOB and Free Enterprise Fund where Congress
had also enacted a statute that said the PCAOB was not
an agency or instrumentality of government, that no
board members or employees were going to be considered
officers or employees of the Federal government.  The
parties in that case, which included the United States,
did not dispute that the appointments clause and
separation of powers concerns that were at issue there
were applicable to the PCAOB, notwithstanding those
general statements by Congress.  And we do think here --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was just going to
say your argument that Amtrak is governmental for
purposes of -- that doesn't get you to the finish line,
right?  I mean, if you had a law that said the
Department of Defense and the Department of State will
consult and jointly issue regulations and if they don't,
this private individual resolved it for them, that would
still present the same problems.
MR. GANNON:  Well, I think,
Mr. Chief Justice, you are referring to the arbitrator
provision.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.
MR. GANNON:  Before we get to the arbitrator
provision, I do think that -- that this would resolve
the question.  And ultimately, if this is not regulatory
authority that cannot be conditioned --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it wouldn't resolve
the question.  Only -- only perhaps for delegation
purposes.  But -- but it doesn't resolve the -- the
other issue in the case, which is due process.  That is
to say, even if this is a governmental entity, there are
some things that governmental entities can't do.  And,
indeed, I think that the case law in this area relies on
the due process clause more than on the distinction
simply between public and private entities.
MR. GANNON:  Well, to be sure, the Carter
Coal case talked about both nondelegation ideas and also
due process issues.  We -- we would be surprised if
the Court wanted to decide the due process issue here
since it wasn't decided by the court of appeals.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It was raised.
MR. GANNON:  It certainty was raised.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it's -- and it's argued
here.
MR. GANNON:  It -- it has been argued in the
red brief here.  And we do think that we're correct on
the merits with respect to the due process issue and
that -- for two principal reasons.  One is that what is
at stake here is not the equivalent of what was going on
in the due process cases.  This is not like the
de-licensing of optometrists in the Gibson v. Berryhill
case.  It's not like the wage and hour requirements in
Carter Coal, because -- because the analogy to those
things here is the statutory preference requirement
rather than the antecedent metrics and standards.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  But the statutory
preference requirement requires -- would require
consideration of whatever is determined by this body,
right?
MR. GANNON:  The statutory preference
requirement is independent of the metrics and standards
and preexists them.  That is what the Surface
Transportation Board would be enforcing in a proceeding
under Section 24308(f).  The metrics and standards --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What must it consider?
MR. GANNON:  The metrics and standards play
a triggering and gatekeeping role.  The -- these
provisions are reprinted in the government's brief on
pages 15A and 16A of the appendix, that the -- the
investigation by the Surface Transportation Board is
triggered by their having been a failure by Amtrak to
satisfy the metrics and standards.  But I think that --
that -- that is -- and if we're talking about the due
process cases, that is not the prohibition that
the Court has been concerned about.  If you look at
cases like Roberge, which talked about Cusack, it said
that it's okay to have something that is presumptively
bad banned by the legislature.
Here, the analogy to that is the statutory
preference, and it's okay, then, to allow a private
party to relax its application in certain circumstances.
And we think that's the role that the metrics and
standards play here, because Congress could have allowed
Amtrak to ask for an STB investigation into violations
of the statute any time it wanted to.  And instead what
they said is that it is only -- you are only going to
get that investigation when you have failed to -- to
perform at an adequate level such that we think there's
been adequate injury.  And then in that investigation,
you are going to have to establish that the injury to
you was caused by the violation of the statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So in your -- in your
view, the case would come out the same way if Amtrak
could issue these metrics and standards entirely on its
own, without consultation with the -- or cooperation
with the government.  Same -- same case --
MR. GANNON:  One of the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- same result?
MR. GANNON:  One prong of our argument is,
yes, that because this is not regulatory in that sense,
this is more like the neighbors being able to veto the
billboard in the neighborhood in Cusack, which the Court
said was okay in Roberge, because the statutory
preference is presumptively bad.  Violations of the
statutory preference by the freight railroads were the
thing that Congress wanted to be enforceable here, and
the metrics and standards just cabin the circumstances
in which Amtrak can seek that type of enforcement.
If I could return to the Chief Justice's
question about the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You may.  You may.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That doesn't stop -- do
the metes and standards stop you from initiating or stop
the agency from initiating a review, even if a carrier
meets the metes and standard?
MR. GANNON:  Well, it's -- it's not the
carrier.  It's not the host railroad that would meet the
standards.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, it would be --
MR. GANNON:  It would be Amtrak's own
performance.
But there is -- there is -- that would
depend upon the reading of the beginning clause of
(f)(1) which refers to if on-time performance fails to
satisfy 80 percent for two consecutive quarters or the
service quality isn't complied with for two quarters,
then those are the circumstances in which an
investigation could be requested and -- in which
instance the STB would need to start the investigation
or the STB could initiate the investigation.
And there is an open question about that
first clause about whether the 80 percent on-time
performance reference is something that has to be
predicated upon the metrics and standards.  That's been
briefed before the Surface Transportation Board in the
proceeding brought against Canadian National, the
complaint of which is reprinted -- a snippet from which
is reprinted at the end of the joint appendix.  And so
the question there would be whether on-time performance
there depends upon a pre-PRIIA definition rather than
the ones that are included in the metrics and standards.
So there's a possibility that the agency
could --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we were -- if we were
to rule that this is not a regulatory action, would that
satisfy the entire case?  We wouldn't have to go to the
delegation issue or to whether it was public or private,
et cetera.
MR. GANNON:  I -- I think that that is
right.  And I think even in those circumstances, because
it -- because if it's not regulatory, it's okay for
private persons to have that power, and I think that
would cover even the question of whether -- if -- if the
arbitrator is assumed to be private.  That is not what
we think is the case.
And we also think that we don't have to win
on that agreement either on -- on the question of --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If the -- if the
actions are not regulatory, why -- why did Amtrak's
performance drop dramatically as soon as the Court
issued its decision in this case?
MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that's because of
the -- that had decreased the threat of enforcement of
the statutory preference.  I do think that the -- it is
the statutory preference that is having the regulatory
impact here.  The freight railroads are not going to be
held liable for Amtrak's failure to satisfy the metrics
and standards.  They're going to be held liable for
failing to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They're going to
be -- Amtrak can then force a proceeding at which the
freight carriers will have to defend, right?
MR. GANNON:  That -- that is correct.  And
the same thing --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's a
significant regulatory impact, to tell railroads I, a
private party, get to start a governmental proceeding
and you have to show up to defend it.
MR. GANNON:  Yes.  But that -- that
happens --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And, by the way, if
I don't -- it's triggered if I don't comply with
standards that I get to set.
MR. GANNON:  It's -- but we allow private
parties to initiate governmental investigations and
enforcement proceedings all the time, either before
administrative agencies or courts, and we don't think
that that is a delegation of legislative power --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Gannon --
MR. GANNON:  -- to the person who is
beginning the investigation.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is the -- is the government
able to award damages without the showing that there's
been a violation of the metrics and standards?
MR. GANNON:  No.  That is -- that is going
to be a threshold determination.  But as I said, that is
a -- it's serving as a threshold gatekeeping function
to -- of -- of limiting the circumstances in which the
investigation can begin and when there will be damages.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I would think if that's
the case, if the statutory preference does not get -- is
a -- if a violation of the statutory preference doesn't
get you all the way to damages, if there is essentially
a second requirement which is a violation of the metrics
and standards, I mean, in effect what the -- a statute
does is it says there are two things you need to show, a
violation of the preference and a violation of the
metrics and standards, in order to get to damages.  That
seems -- if -- if that's the case, it seems kind of
regulatory.
MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- I -- I understand
the impulse, but I think that seems -- it -- it also
seems like the ability of the neighbors to veto the
billboards in Cusack because what Amtrak -- all Amtrak
has done is relax certain circumstances in which the
freight railroads can be held liable for violating the
statutory preference.  A violation of the statutory
preference is presumptively a bad thing.
And what has happened here is Congress has
recognized that if it doesn't actually cause Amtrak to
be -- to have sufficiently subpar performance, then we
are not going to make a Federal case out of it and we're
not going to let Amtrak do so.  But -- and -- and there
aren't going to be damages at the end of the day.
But I do think that the real-world reason of
why the freight railroads had greater incentive to
cooperate and Amtrak believes that it was their
cooperation under the regime in which the metrics and
standards were in effect, and there was still the
possibility that there would be enforcement proceedings
before the STB to determine whether the freight
railroads had failed to comply with the statute --
JUSTICE ALITO:  The statute says that the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we -- can we get back
to the arbitrator?  I think the Chief asked that
question that -- and we passed it and assume it's
regulatory.
MR. GANNON:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The arbitrator, it's
argued, need not be a government officer.  It could be a
private officer.  I have a question to ask about that
provision.
Is it -- is this a one-time operation, that
is, the setting these metrics and standards?  In -- in
fact, there was no arbitrator in this picture.  Will
there be a renewal of this, a repetition where there
might be an arbitrator?
MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- I don't think that
the terms of 207(d) contemplate that the arbitrator will
come into effect again.  I think that because the
beginning of it says that it -- it is only triggered if
a development of the metrics and standard is not
completed within the 180-day period required by
subsection (a), which is the 180 days after PRIIA was
enacted in 2008.
And so the arbitration provision was, I
think, good for one time only.  It was never invoked.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but does that
matter?  I mean, the idea is that having the
arbitrator -- arbitration provision there affected the
issuance of the regulations.
MR. GANNON:  Yes, I -- I understand that
question, Mr. Chief Justice.  I -- I think that's --
it -- it mattered the first time around.  To the extent
that there may be any amendments to the metrics and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If --
MR. GANNON:  -- standards in the future --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.
MR. GANNON:  -- the arbitrator wouldn't be
applicable.  We do not think that the best reading of
the arbitrator reference is that that would be a private
person.  We think that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I know -- if I
could -- there's -- the issues are pretty intertwined
here, so I know it's a difficult thing to keep track of
for you.  But if -- if -- and for us.  But if we think
that the regulations have a regulations -- not to load
the question --
MR. GANNON:  The metrics and standards have
a regulatory affect.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Metrics and
standards are regulations.  And if we think there is
nothing in the statute that requires -- well, I guess it
doesn't -- doesn't -- doesn't really matter.
If that's the case, is the arbitrator an
officer of the United States?  In other words, if he is
the one that ends up issuing what we will hypothetically
conclude are regulations, I assume he has to be an
officer of the United States.
MR. GANNON:  I -- I think that would
constitute significant governmental authority under
Buckley against Valeo, and that would be --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you know, I'm quite
interested in the government's view of this case, and I
hope you will calm me down.
The reason that I find it interesting is
because it seems to me there are hundreds, maybe
thousands of organizations that set standards for the
industry.  And some of them operate under government
memoranda or authority that ask them to do it, the most
noted being ICANN which sets all the standards for the
internet.
Now, it also seems to me very possible that
a member of such an organization that fails to follow
the standard could run afoul of other government rules
or other agency rules or other laws, for example, by
stalling the internet delivery of services and being
delayed, and violating some FCC requirement.  And since
I know that there are about 2 or 300 international
organizations that we belong to, to do such things, I
just wonder what the implications would be if you lose
this case.  That is to say, if this Court held here that
if a government, say, Congress, agency, Commerce
Department, says to a group of private people set
standards, and then if they fail -- or if they do so and
a member fails to meet a standard, it runs afoul of a
different rule, such as a rule that you have to have a
certain speed on the Internet or some such thing.  Were
we to hold that unconstitutional, I have a feeling --
that this is what I want assurance on that I'm wrong -- that
it would work havoc, possibly with the Internet,
possibly with industry throughout the United States, I
know not where, possibly in communications, possibly
with the 200 or so organizations regulated by treaty.
Now, you've looked into this more than I
and, therefore, I want you to calm me down and say no,
this isn't a big-deal case.  Don't worry about it.
MR. GANNON:  I think it depends upon how
broad the Court's ruling is.  I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  The ruling is
narrow.  It just says the following.  It says, these are
standards which equal legislation and as a result of
these standards being legislated by this, I think,
Quango or something, or whatever, by -- by this
particular entity, bad things happen to freight trains
when they fail to meet the standards or something and
they violate some other law and that's all
unconstitutional.
MR. GANNON:  And I frankly --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Going back to Carter v.
Carter Coal.
MR. GANNON:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  We could go back to
Lochner.
MR. GANNON:  I don't think that -- that
Respondent is asking for a ruling of that nature.  And I
think that the question here would be because of the
role that the metrics and standards play in the STB
investigation.  I think that would be the only way in
which the Court would conclude that it is -- is
tantamount to regulations.  We don't believe that they
have that effect.  We don't think that other standards
that are conditions for application of -- of the law out
there in the world have necessarily the same effects
under even Respondent's view of the case.  But I -- and
so I -- I think that the one you want to get
reassurances from is actually Respondent, that the
nature of their challenge is -- is narrower than that.
But if I could return to the arbitrator --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thanks.
I know it's a -- if he is an officer, is the
government's issue a principal officer or an inferior
officer?
MR. GANNON:  I think that he would be an
inferior officer given the limited nature of the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Then who --
which principal officer supervises him?
MR. GANNON:  It -- it would be the STB that
appointed him.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But he's an
arbitrator.
MR. GANNON:  He's an arbitrator.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One of the parties
to the arbitration.
MR. GANNON:  I don't think the STB is a
party to the arbitration.  I think that the -- the two
parties who have to issue the -- their metrics and
standards are Amtrak and the Federal Railroad
Administration.  If they don't agree, then an
arbitration -- the arbitrator would be resolving a
dispute not -- the STB wouldn't be a party to that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if the STB
doesn't like the arbitrator's decision, can the STB
change it under the law?
MR. GANNON:  I doubt it because it's
supposed to be a binding arbitration.  But we think that
from the beginning, this is yet another reason to
construe the arbitrator as being somebody who is
governmental, probably somebody who is actually at the
STB.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I don't see how
you can say he's an inferior officer.  He's supervised
by nobody.  That's what we have held to be the -- the
touchstone of principal versus inferior.
MR. GANNON:  He's appointed by the super --
the Surface Transportation Board --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's it.  And supervised
by nobody.
MR. GANNON:  -- to perform a limited task.
He could be removed by the STB.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  A limited task is -- is not
the touchstone.  I mean, that's what we said in Morrison
and we repudiated it in a later case, which said the
touchstone of a -- of a principal officer is whether
that person is not subject to control by somebody else.
And I don't see how this person is subject to any
control in -- in the task that he's assigned.
MR. GANNON:  Well, in that sense, it's
consistent with Morrison, and it is not consistent with
what the Court said was sufficient to enter the question
in Edmund, but did not say was necessary to answer the
question in Edmund about there being review within the
Executive Branch of the decisions being made by the
Coast Guard judges there.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let me -- let me talk about
regulatory effect.  As I understand it, once these --
what do you call them?
MR. GANNON:  The metrics and standards.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Metrics and standards.
Once they were issued, wow, the -- the on-time record of
Amtrak went way, way up.  So they had a very immediate
and clear effect on the behavior of -- of the parties.
Now, do you think that because the
sentencing guidelines are now just advisory that we
could have the sentencing guidelines issued by some
private party that -- that is not appointed pursuant to
the requirements of the Constitution?  Because after
all, they're just advisory.  Now, the reality is, they
have a significant effect on -- on the behavior of -- of
lower courts.  And I think it's the same thing here.
There's a significant effect.  I don't know --
MR. GANNON:  I -- I don't think that this is
the same as the sentencing guidelines, the effect that
it has on the judges, because those are advice to the
judges.  Here, what the metrics and standards do is they
satisfy conditions in the world when -- when the Federal
statute is going to be applicable.  It's in that sense,
just like the Court contemplated in JW Hampton or indeed
in cases like Currin v. Wallace and Rock Royal
Cooperative, where the policy was established by the
Federal government, the Secretary of Agriculture wanted
to put a price order in effect or to say that a
particular tobacco market would be subject to a Federal
inspection regime and that could not occur until --
until there was approval from private entities.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why did the record improve
so -- so rapidly and so promptly?
MR. GANNON:  Because for the first time in
decades there was a meaningful threat that there would
be an enforcement proceeding, not to enforce the metrics
and standards, but to enforce the statutory preference
requirement, which is not challenged here, which was not
written by Amtrak, and which would be enforced by the
Surface Transportation Board in an independent
adjudication in which they would take evidence from both
sides and determine what the real story was.  There's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can -- can I go back to
my question, okay?  Can the STB on its own start an
investigation?
MR. GANNON:  I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If -- if it gets --
MR. GANNON:  That depends, Justice
Sotomayor, on -- on the answer to as I said is an
unresolved question about whether the 80 percent on-time
performance trigger at the beginning of 24308(f)(1)
is -- is read as being confines to the on-time
performance metrics and standards that were adopted
under PRIIA or whether that can be a reference to a
pre-PRIIA, on-time performance metric.  And so for
decades, Amtrak, pursuant to ICC -- originally pursuant
to an ICC order used endpoint on-time performance
metrics that looked very much like the ones that were
ultimately adopted --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So doesn't this show
something?  Actually, the sentencing guidelines are a
pretty good example.  You do have the Model Penal Code.
We have law professors telling judges what to do all the
time.  We have judges who receive information in briefs.
We had lots of guidelines promulgated by the states.
There are all kinds of systems, and judges do use them,
and some of them do have a practical effect and make a
difference.
But once this Court starts down the road --
and it would be starting, because I am aware of no
precedent -- once we start down the road of saying
Congress cannot tell even a private agency to go and
make some standards, which we all know will be followed,
once we start down that road there is no stopping place
and, therefore, the measure has nothing to do with
separation of powers.  It is exactly what Justices
Cardozo, Hughes, Brandeis and Stone said in Carter Coal,
the measure is the due process clause, and we're all off
on something of a wild goose chase in this case.  That's
what is suggested to me by the sentencing guideline
analogy.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wow, I didn't mean that.
(Laughter.)
MR. GANNON:  To the extent that Justice
Scalia also doesn't see a nondelegation problem in
Carter Coal, then I -- I take it that you are agreeing, but I
think here that -- that the criminal sentencing context
may present different issues.  And I do think that the
basic -- the basic reasons why the due process issue is
not one where we would have a problem is both because of
the -- what we think is the -- the fact that this is
relaxing the regulatory effect of -- of the statutory
preference.  And secondly, because those cases about
bias in the due process context involve the entity
that's actually doing the adjudication.  And here the
analogy is that's the STB is acting as the Board of
Optometrists in -- in the Gibson v. Berryhill.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think it was the
Respondent's brief in which they gave the hypothetical.
Suppose that the government together with auto
manufacturer A made standards, but then auto
manufacturers B and C had to follow them.  That seems
wrong.  Why is this different?
MR. GANNON:  I take the point that that
seems wrong.  We don't think that this is the equivalent
of regulating the automotive industry because Congress
has put the regulation in place.  That's the statutory
preference requirement.  This is something in which
automobile manufacturer A would be, in advance, saying,
I, automobile manufacturer --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose Congress put that
in place?  Suppose Congress said, and once this is
promulgated, all manufacturers have to obey it.
MR. GANNON:  I think that that would --
without the federal agreement that we also have here,
the federal railroad administration’s contemporaneous
agreement with the standards, that would present non
delegation problems.
But, if I could reserve the remainder of my
time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Dupree.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DUPREE, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DUPREE:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court:
The constitution does not permit Congress to
create a corporation, deem it nongovernmental, and then
launch it into the commercial sphere with a for-profit
mandate and then vest it with regulatory authority over
other companies in the same industry.
The text of the constitution places all
legislative power in the Congress.  Although this Court
has approved grants of rulemaking authority to executive
branch agencies or judicial branch agencies, it has
never approved a grant of regulatory power to a private
corporation.
JUSTICE GINSBERG:  What do you do about --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the big problem
here, regulatory authority.  As far as I'm concerned,
that's the big difficulty.  Why is this an exercise of
regulatory authority when all it does is enable an
investigation?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, Justice Scalia, I don't
think it's quite correct to say all it does is enable an
investigation.  For one thing, there is the provision in
Section 207 (c) that requires the freight railroads to
amend their contracts with Amtrak to the extent
practicable to incorporate the metrics and standards.
So there is a direct regulatory command on the freight
railroad.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but to the extent
practicable, I mean, what does that mean?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, unless it's a null set,
Justice Kagan, it has to mean something.  And I don't
think the government has ever said that the freight
railroads --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So instead you want a
rule that lets the STB investigate even when you have
one failure to accommodate?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, I'm not sure that's the
rule we want, Justice Sotomayor, but at least that would
have the merit --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you would prefer
that?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, it would at least have
the merit of being constitutional.  In other words, the
problem here is not necessarily the scope of the
investigatory power.  It's the fact that Congress gave
Amtrak the pen or co-authorship of the regulation.
That's the constitutional vice here --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Just like the Department of
Commerce acting under authority from Congress gave ICANN
the power to write standards for the internet.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, and, Justice Breyer, let
me address your concern head on.  Because we've been
litigating this case against the government for several
years now and to my knowledge no party involved -- the
parties, the amici have foreseen the dire consequences
that you honor posits --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not saying it's a dire
consequence.  By coincidence, I happen to be reading
about the internet.  I'm trying to learn about
something.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, Justice Breyer, I can
make a few points in response.  One is that in the ICANN
case that's not a situation where you have a company
trying to regulate other competitors in the market.
That is one difference.  Another difference is that a
lot of these organizations tender their proposed
standards to the agency for approval.  So at the end of
the day, it's the agency that has the final say in many
cases.  That's this model that Congress enacted.
And here, Congress plainly could have given
Amtrak an advisory role, Section 207 (a) gives all sorts
of entities and participants with a stake in these rules
an advisory role.  And there is absolutely no reason
that Congress could not easily have drafted that statute
to give Amtrak an advisory role.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if the government
agency, the FRA, it says, you know, what Amtrak
proposes, the government's assent is essential to this
scheme, right?
MR. DUPREE:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.  But
I think the key point here is that Amtrak's assent is
also essential.  So, to be sure, the government could
halt a regulation that Amtrak wanted to put in effect, but the
constitutional advice here is that Amtrak has the same
power.  It could prevent the government from putting the
government's preferred regulation in place.  And that's
giving too much power to a private entity to be able to
dictate to the federal government what regulations will
be issued --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You don't have to answer
this question, but have you thought through what this
means -- what I think is called the Baal conference
where you have groups of regulators and banks meeting
together to determine what they are going to do about
interest rates, money supplied, et cetera.  You have
not, is the answer, and I don't know enough about it, so
skip it.
MR. DUPREE:  Very good.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but then, how do
you -- do you say that we were just plain wrong when we
let the tobacco industry and milk producers veto
regulations in our two prior cases Currin and Rock
Royal?
MR. DUPREE:  Yes, the difference in those
cases, Justice Sotomayor, is that in those cases it was
a federal government that drafted the regulation.  And
what happened at that point was that Congress gave the
industry -- or in those cases a super majority of the
industry the power to vote whether to subject themselves
to the regulation.  And the distinction there is between
the government exercising the legislative authority and
the private company determining when that
authority becomes effective.  That's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's -- that line is
too thin for me.  Because consent to me means it has to
satisfy both parties.  And that's no different than a
veto.  This is the STB saying, this satisfies us, this
is what we would like to do.  Amtrak is this -- are you
willing to be regulated, just like the tobacco produce
-- the tobacco industry and the milk producers.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, for one thing my clients,
the regulated parties, were not given a say in this.  So
to say Amtrak, is this what you want --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the due process.
That's the due process.
MR. DUPREE:  Fair enough.  Then, with regard
to Your Honor's point --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that's fair enough
by the way.  That's an issue that's fair enough.  But --
and subject to more talk.  But I'm not quite sure why
this becomes --
MR. DUPREE:  With regard to Your Honor's
earlier point about that being a thin line, I understand
that but at the same time that is the line, the precise
line that this Court explicitly drew both in Curran and
in J.W. Hampton where it said that allowing this vote of
the regulated parties, that doesn't amount to
legislative action.  Agreed it may be a fine line but it
is the line that this Court has reverted to time and
again.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know what they
meant because they were subjecting themselves to
standards.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, and I would simply go
back to our point that we never had a vote in this
process.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you make of the
provision to which you referred earlier that says that
the metrics and standards shall be incorporated into the
operating agreements to the greatest extent practicable
or to the extent practicable.  If a particular railroad
took the position that it will never agree to the
incorporation of the metrics and standards into an
operating agreement, is there anything that the federal
government could do?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, Justice Alito, I think in
that situation what would likely happen if Amtrak and
the freight railroad could not reach agreement and
therefore there was no agreement on the terms of the
operating agreement, is that the Surface Transportation
Board ultimately would be called upon to step in and
essentially dictate terms or help the parties reach
terms and proscribe the terms of the operating
agreement.  And I think in that situation -- again, it
hasn't yet arisen but it would not surprise me in the
slightest if Amtrak's argument at that point to the
Surface Transportation Board was pointing to the
language of 207 (c) and saying, this freight railroad is
under a statutory mandate that it shall amend its
agreements to the extent practicable.  And nothing in
the statute suggests that the determination as to
practicability is something that falls within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the freight railroads.  The
statutory language doesn't suggest that.  If this Court
were to hold that, I certainly wouldn't quarrel with it,
but I'm not quite sure the statutory language gets you
there.
I think one fundamental flaw with the
statute which we've not yet touched on, an additional
flaw, is the problem of accountability.  That, of
course, is the concern that has animated this Court's
non delegation and due process jurisprudence.  And here
you have a situation where Congress, the President and
Amtrak itself have repeatedly declared to the public in
explicit terms that Amtrak is not the government.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think that's
dispositive?  Because I've always thought that the
labels that Congress decides to put on these things is
not of particular relevance.
MR. DUPREE:  I'm not so sure I would go so
far as to say it's dispositive, Justice Kagan.  But I do
think it's highly relevant.  I think when this Court has
spoken about transparency and accountability in the
legislative process, what it's been talking about is the
ability of the public to look at a regulation or a law
and make a judgment as to where to assign blame.  And
when you have all parties involved assuring the public
that Amtrak is not a government actor, I think the
public is entitled to take the President and the
Congress at their word and say that this is not the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And not look at the
animal as it exists?  Lebron said that the government
exerts control over Amtrak as a policy maker.  This --
Amtrak, you will agree, is not like a private
corporation.  It's -- there's a great deal of federal
involvement in Amtrak, right?
MR. DUPREE:  I agree.  I agree.  But I think
what resolves this case is the fact that Amtrak operates
under a statutory mandate to conduct its affairs as
though it were a non-governmental entity and a
for-profit corporation.  In fact, in the briefing --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the post office is
supposed to be a for-profit corporation, too, to the
same extent, right?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, yes, Justice Kagan, keep
in mind the post office is expressly created as a
federal entity, it's in our Constitution and in Federal
statutory law it says the post office is an agency or an
entity within the executive branch.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But then that all goes back
to labels.  I mean, I guess I'm just wondering what
about Amtrak is not governmental other than the label.
MR. DUPREE:  Well --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Subject to the policy
control of Congress, which Congress exercises pretty
much on a routine basis, it's entirely funded by
Congress, all the members of the board are appointed by
the President with the advice and consent of the Senate,
save the -- save one.
You know, I guess I'm just wondering other
than this label, what suggests that this is not the
government?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, first, I would take issue
with just the label.  In other words, the organic
statute of Amtrak in the US Code says it is not the
government.  So it may be a little more than just a
label.
But taking Your Honor's point, I think what
makes Amtrak not the government for nondelegation
purposes is that Amtrak's officers and employees are not
Federal employees, they don't take an oath of office and
they are constrained by various financial incentives and
statutory mandates to operate Amtrak not in the common
good, not as a neutral, disinterested regulator would,
but as a for-profit commercial actor.
That's actually the very point that Amtrak
made to this Court in its Lebron brief where it said
keep in mind, we are not neutral government regulators,
we are hungry capitalists.  That's how we run Amtrak.
We have a --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  We rejected that
argument.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, it rejected the ultimate
constitutional conclusion for purposes of the First
Amendment claim, but I don't think this Court took issue
with the fact that Amtrak's officers and directors have
said from day one very publicly that we don't govern in
any sense.  We are not neutral, disinterested
regulators.  We are a for-profit business.  And that's
what makes this case different, Justice Kagan.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So for -- I mean, for that
purpose, what difference does it make whether it's a
governmental entity or not, so long as it is operating
on a for-profit basis and is giving -- is given the last
word on some regulatory matters that disadvantage its
competitors, there's a violation of due process.  I -- I
don't see how it makes any difference whether you call
it governmental or not.
MR. DUPREE:  Justice Scalia, I certainly
agree a hundred percent with you on the due process
point.  I think that whether it is government or
nongovernmental may play a role if this Court were to
approach this case through the lens of nondelegation,
but as far as due process goes, Your Honor is exactly
correct.  No matter what we call Amtrak, the question
ultimately at the end of the day is whether this
Federally-chartered corporation with all of the various
financial incentives, statutory mandates and commands,
can exercise regulatory power over other commercial
actors in the marketplace.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The due process question
wasn't -- the due process question wasn't aired below at
all; isn't that so?
MR. DUPREE:  It was aired below, Justice
Ginsburg.  We have fully briefed due process at every
stage of this case, as has the government.  The district
court resolved it on the merits and the D.C. Circuit
didn't need to reach it because it resolved it on
nondelegation grounds, but it did drop a footnote and
said, nondelegation and due process are so closely
intertwined in this context and, frankly, we're not
sure, as Justice Scalia suggested, whether ultimately it
would make a difference.  So that's why I took the
nondelegation route.  But there's no question that due
process is fully briefed, fully teed up for this Court's
review.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And not decided by the
D.C. Circuit.
MR. DUPREE:  I beg your pardon?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And not decided --
MR. DUPREE:  That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- because the D.C.
Circuit went on a delegation.
MR. DUPREE:  That's correct.  But as I said,
they said in the footnote, Footnote 3 toward the
beginning of the opinion, that they didn't see much of a
difference in this context because Carter Coal speaks
both to nondelegation and due process and it did an
analysis under Carter Coal.
So regardless if this Court thinks that
Carter Coal is more properly characterized as
nondelegation of due process, the merits of that
question are squarely before this Court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So are you attacking the
statute that says that competitors have to accommodate
Amtrak?  Is that what you're saying is the due process
violation?
MR. DUPREE:  It's not, Justice Sotomayor.
The statute that we're attacking is Section 207 of
PRIIA.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the -- but the
investigation is only going to determine whether you
violated the statute's failure to accommodate Amtrak.
MR. DUPREE:  I don't think that's quite
right, Your Honor.  In other words, the -- a necessary
predicate for liability is not just violation of the
preference statute, but also a violation of the metrics
and standards.  The government needs to prove both.  It
needs to prove violation of the metrics and standards
and violation of the preference requirement.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Can the government -- what
is the due process violation?  That is to say, if the
Department of Energy under delegated authority says that
the makers of the bulbs that are energy efficient must
use, and they may choose any one of the five methods
that produces green light or white light or whatever it
is, and they are -- they are to choose the method, and
that's just it.  Now, that puts at a disadvantage those
competitors who do not use energy-efficient bulbs.  Is
that a violation of due process?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, if I'm understanding Your
Honor's hypothetical, it doesn't sound like it because
you have a situation where it's the government that's
prescribing the regulations.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  It gives them
considerable leeway as to make subsidiary decisions.  I
was trying to make it realistic.  They make subsidiary
decisions as to how they go about fulfilling the basic
energy efficiency mandate.
MR. DUPREE:  Right.  It -- it -- the way
Your Honor described that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I just described it
now.
MR. DUPREE:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  They have broad authority,
but they have to meet certain energy-efficient mandates
and they can prescribe standards and so forth that will
allow them to do it.  Does that violate due process
because it hurts the manufacturers of ordinary energy
bulbs?
MR. DUPREE:  If -- when you say "prescribe
standards," it would pose a problem if the standards
they're prescribing apply to others in the industry.  If
the way Your Honor posited it originally, it sounded as
though Congress was essentially giving --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It applies.  They don't
have to meet it.  What happens is it gives them an
advantage the way they choose over non-energy efficient
bulbs.
MR. DUPREE:  That doesn't sound like a due
process violation.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Then what is your violation
here?  I'm trying to figure out what your violation --
MR. DUPREE:  The violation here is that
Congress has given Amtrak the pen.
JUSTICE BREYER:  The what?
MR. DUPREE:  The pen.  To write the Federal
regulations.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have to posit that the
energy department manufactures bulbs.
MR. DUPREE:  No.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that it keeps the
profit from the bulbs on its own.  It doesn't have to go
deposit it in the treasury.  So the -- so the -- it is a
profit-making entity and it prescribes standards, as
Justice Breyer suggested, that harms other people.  That
would be a parallel to this.
MR. DUPREE:  Well -- and if that's the
situation where the government is both acting in the
marketplace as a commercial actor and as a regulator of
the industry, that's a problem.
But what makes this case, I think, so
difficult is that being a commercial for-profit actor is
fundamentally incompatible with the notion of being a
disinterested government regulator.  That's because the
essence of a --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what I was -- I'm
trying to get at -- I started with the statement, I
think, that due process -- your argument -- it didn't
matter whether you called them private or public; am I
right?
MR. DUPREE:  That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, let's imagine
they're just a company, not the Department of Energy.
The Department of Energy has a broad energy efficient
standard.  It delegates to the people who make that kind
of bulb all kinds of minor interstitial standards to
make.  They make them.  They hurt the energy bulbs, the
ordinary energy bulbs.  Is that a violation of due
process?  If so, why?  If not, how is yours different?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, that -- I think that
might be a violation of due process because in that
situation what happens is that the Department of Energy
is giving authority to private corporations to set
rules, standards that govern the conduct of other
private corporations.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It will hurt the other
private organizations.
MR. DUPREE:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  My reaction was the way you
deal with that normally is the statute would be
interpreted not to give them the authority to write
anticompetitive regulations and you'd attack it under
the antitrust laws.  There may be other ways to do it.
I've never heard of an example where the due process
problem really was a constitutional problem under due
process.
Now -- now, maybe there's some cases I've
overlooked.  The only one coming close, it seemed to me,
is Carter v. Carter Coal, which I always put in the same
box as Lochner.  Now -- now, are we supposed to
resurrect that?  Is there other authority for that
proposition?  What is it?
MR. DUPREE:  Well, Justice Breyer, I do
believe that this Court on multiple occasions subsequent
to the Lochner era has reaffirmed the core holding of
Carter Coal about delegations to private parties are
forbidden.  This Court said that in Mistretta.  A number
of justices have said in separate opinions that that
holding remains --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But your due process, I
want some authority for your due process point on the
private agencies.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, our -- the foundational
case we have for due process in this context is Carter
Coal.  Absolutely.  But again, I simply take issue with
Your Honor's suggestion that it's a remnant of the
Lochner era.  I think it retains its vitality today as
many subsequent opinions of this Court have recognized.
Let me address Mr. Gannon's point very
briefly, if I may, on the notion that it was somehow the
preference requirement that was driving the dramatic
change in Amtrak's performance.  The preference
requirement was enacted in the early 1970s.  So Mr.
Gannon is unable to explain why this magical change
didn't occur until the metrics and standards came into
effect.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, he said the metrics
and standards for the first time made it realistic that
there would be enforcement of that requirement.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, first, I would say if
that's true, that, to me, strikes me as a pretty plain
regulatory effect in that the metrics and standards are
on the books and the freight railroads know that they
now need to comply or they're going to face enforcement
actions.  The government --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  I think -- I think you
can allow a private party to bring an enforcement
action.
MR. DUPREE:  You can allow a private
party --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, even if they just
said an enforcement action shall be commenced if Amtrak
requests it.  I think that would be perfectly
constitutional.
MR. DUPREE:  I agree, Justice Scalia, but at
the same time the problem here is that Congress has
given Amtrak the power to define the terms and to draft
the regulations in which it may bring an enforcement
action.  If --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Dupree, I mean, one way
to look at this on the delegation question, not on the
due process question but on the delegation question, is
that there is government all over this at every step,
that there is all kinds of supervision of Amtrak itself,
no matter what Amtrak does that; but with respect to the
metrics and standards, particularly, that there is no
way Amtrak is actually going to be able to get anything
unless the FRA comes aboard, and that furthermore, that
even those metrics and standards are useless unless the
Surface Transportation Board decides to enforce the
preference requirement.
So there is, like, no place at which a
private actor can do something itself in this scheme, it
would seem to me.
MR. DUPREE:  Well, I -- I take the point
that the FRA is involved in the development of the
standards, but I don't think it follows from -- from
that premise to say that Congress can give a private
company and the Federal government joint ownership of
the pen in drafting the regulations.  That's the
problem.
And with regard to the issue of government
control over Amtrak, the government conceded in the D.C.
Circuit that it did not control Amtrak on a day-to-day
basis and that includes, for present purposes, the
rulemaking at issue.  In fact, Congress certainly did
not view the Federal government as controlling Amtrak in
the rulemaking, because if it did, it would not have
inserted the arbitration provision.
Congress clearly understood that in the
context of this rulemaking, the Federal government did
not control Amtrak.  That is why the arbitration
provision is in there.
Unless there are further questions, we’ll
ask that the judgment below be affirmed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Gannon, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. GANNON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. Dupree stressed the question of
accountability, and I think as Justice Kagan was just
pointing out that there is plenty of accountability here
for the Federal government.  The Federal government's
fingerprints are all over not just Amtrak but also the
metrics and standards because the FRA had to approve
them.
On the Amtrak side here, the metrics and
standards were approved by Amtrak's president who is
somebody who is appointed by the eight presidential
appointees and serves at their pleasure.  And so the
notion that this is just somebody down in the bowels
of -- of a corporation's day-to-day operations that the
Federal government had no connection with, I think, is
misguided.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would you talk about the
contract provision?
MR. GANNON:  Yes, we think that  --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You should have raised that
in your -- I should have raised it in your principal.
MR. GANNON:  We think that the contract's
provisions are -- the statutory provision there in 207
does require the contracts to be incorporated to the
extent practicable.  We have actually said in our brief
that we think that that is something that is largely due
to negotiation between the parties.  There are certain
aspects of the metrics and standards that it would not
make sense to incorporate in the contracts, and what the
statute --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But if they can't come to
an agreement, who decides what the contract --
MR. GANNON:  As Mr. Dupree said, that the --
then the dispute goes before the surface transportation
board, this is  in 24308 --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the STB --
MR. GANNON:  Will determine what are, quote,
"reasonable terms and conditions."
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which would include --
which would include the requirement that, to the extent
practicable, the standards set forth by Amtrak be
followed.
MR. GANNON:  But we -- we don't think that
that requires they be -- they are not things that would
be binding on the freight railroads.  The statute
provides that there needs to be an incentive payment.
For instance, the statute provides that there needs to
be an incentive payment in the contracts.  But it
doesn't mean that that -- that the incentive payment now
has to correspond precisely to what the metrics and
standards are.  That is something that's subject to
negotiation between the parties, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, as -- as your friend
said, to the extent practicable, unless the whole thing
is nugatory, certainly does not wash out the whole
provision.
MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It must have some bite.
What bite does it have?
MR. GANNON:  I think it was to encourage the
parties to ensure that they are now collecting data in
systematic ways, that they can nationalize things,
that -- that they now measure things in the same
fashion, they use minutes instead of seconds or
whatever, and also that there are some parts of the
metrics and standards that wouldn't make sense to go in
the contracts at all, things that have to do with
customer service surveys about -- satisfaction surveys
about the cleanliness of the cars.  And so -- and
ultimately even the canon of constitutional avoidance
could be used to prevent that from doing the work that
would -- that would make it regulatory in this context
if that were to make it a problem here.
I think that it's also the case that
Mr. Dupree is talking about Amtrak as a competitor of
the freight railroads, and we think that that's the
wrong analogy, that Amtrak is effectively like a
customer of a common carrier that is entitled to get
services from the railroads at a particular rate.  And
that's the way it's always been.  And under Respondent's
approach, there would be both nondelegation problems and
due process problems, apparently, with the type of thing
that occurred in Boston against Maine, where this Court
held that Amtrak was able to initiate a condemnation
proceeding for rail property before the ICC, and its
determination that it needed that particular property
had a strong presumption that it was going to be true
and governing in that proceeding.  This Court held that
that was not an impermissible delegation of eminent
domain authority, because the ICC made the ultimate
determination there, notwithstanding the fact that
Amtrak had to trigger the proceeding and Amtrak's
decision to do so created a statutory presumption that
there would be need.
I think that Mr. Dupree also is concerned
about the need for Amtrak's consent here.  This goes
back to the very  first argument that we have in our
brief that under cases like Currin and Rock Royal
Cooperative, the fact that the government needed to
secure the consent of Amtrak is not something that makes
that a delegation outside the government.  Even though
they had the pen along the way, the veto power is what
is most important, and we think it's especially easy to
get there in the context of an entity like Amtrak which
is, at worst, for us quasi-private rather than entirely
private.
And we think if you take that into account
here, also the limited effect that the metrics and
standards have, that this is not a non-delegation
problem for any of the three problems the court of
appeals believed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the
