CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

Clarke.
Ms. Harrington.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MS. HARRINGTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
In this case, the Eleventh Circuit
unambiguously held that a district court always abuses
its discretion when it denies a summons opponent's
request to examine IRS officials based on an unsupported
allegation of improper purpose.  That holding was wrong
for at least three reasons, and even Respondents don't
defend it at this point.
The three reasons are:  First, the Eleventh
Circuit's rule ignores Congress's intent that IRS
summons enforcement proceedings be summary in nature.
Second, the automatic examination rule is inconsistent
with this Court's treatment of analogous,
administrative, and grand jury subpoenas in other
contexts.  And the third, the rule fails to respect the
district courts' core discretion to govern its own
proceedings, including governing when and how evidence
should be developed.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  As you say, the Respondent
concedes all that.  So why don't -- why don't you talk
about what the difference is between you and the
Respondent?  Nobody defends what the lower court said
here, right?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I'm happy to.  The
Respondent suggests two what we think of as unworkable
limitations or potential limitations on the rule.  The
first is that there be a requirement that the allegation
be plausible, though, totally unsupported by evidence.
And in our view, any plausibility requirement that is
untethered to a requirement that a summons opponent
actually point to some evidence that would substantiate
the allegation is really not a limitation at all.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is -- is there really a
difference between those two?  Can it be plausible if
there is -- if there is no evidence that suggests that
it's true?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, in our view, no.  I
mean, I think that's the question that you might want to
direct to Respondents.  They seem to suggest that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It may well be that the two
of you agree in other words, depending on what they
think.
MS. HARRINGTON:  And if that's true, then we
invite the Court to reverse the Eleventh Circuit.  I
mean, the rule we want --
(Laughter.)
MS. HARRINGTON:  What we would like is that
there -- that before a district court is actually
required to allow examination of IRS officials, a
summons opponent has to put in enough evidence to at
least raise an inference of --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It all depends on what -- it
all depends on what you mean by "evidence."  Do you mean
direct evidence?  Is circumstantial evidence enough?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Circumstantial evidence is
enough.  And -- and, again, what we're asking for is
really a modest rule.  A district court, in our view,
has discretion to allow examination of an IRS official.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could you -- could you
apply your rule, district court discretion in this
particular case?  There were two allegations, I think,
that -- the first one was that the -- this was in
retaliation for the taxpayers' refusal for the third
time to extend the limitation period.  And the other was
this was an effort to circumvent the limited discovery
that's allowed in the tax court.
Now, those were the allegations.  What would
the taxpayer have to say in addition to those two
allegations to pass your test?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, so I think there --
there are sort of two threshold questions that the
district court would consider.  The first is whether
those would actually be improper purposes.  And the
second is whether if they would be, they were actually
the motivating purposes in this case.  The district
court -- the court of appeals in this case only
considered the statute of limitations question, and it
found that -- that issuing a summonses after a taxpayer
declined to extend a statute of limitations would be an
improper purpose.  We disagree with that legal holding,
but that's not the question on which we sought this
Court's review --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let -- let's assume
that it is inappropriate for the IRS to avoid
taxpayer -- tax court limitations on discovery.  Let's
assume that a subpoena cannot do that.  The Supinski
declaration, it seems to me, is quite sufficient to make
that showing.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I would just say --
so there's a case we cited in our reply brief called Ash
v. Commissioner, which is a tax court case, which says
that in the tax's court view, there's no problem with
enforcing a summons that was issued before  tax court
proceedings were initiated, as was the case here, that
there's no problem -- there's no interference with the
tax court discovery rule when we need to do that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But my supposition was
that assume that you cannot avoid taxpayer -- or tax
court discovery limits.  If -- if that is so, it seems
to me the Supinski affidavit is quite sufficient.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, it may or may not be.
And, again, if this Court corrects the -- the Eleventh
Circuit didn't consider that because in the Eleventh
Circuit's view, there didn't need to be any evidence.
And so the Eleventh Circuit did not examine the
sufficiency of the evidence that the Respondents
presented.  And so if this Court corrects that legal
rule, Respondents can make these arguments on remand to
the Eleventh Circuit.
But I would just point out with respect to
that -- that proposed improper purpose that the -- the
validity of a summons is judged at the time that the
summons was issued.  And in this case, the summonses
were issued before there was any tax court litigation.
There's always the possibility, when a summons is
issued, that there's going to be tax court litigation
down the road after the IRS makes its determination of
the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is that?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a point -- that's a
point for argument.  I mean, you can argue that to
the -- to the district court.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't want us to
resolve that here.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, you can easily
imagine circumstances where there's a subpoena, an
administrative subpoena issued against Mr. Smith.  By
the time he comes around to enforcing it, where there's
very little reason to enforce it, Mr. Smith is suffering
an incurable disease and the district court would say,
no, it's oppressive.  Right?  I mean, I've never heard
of this rule that you -- a district court would be
forbidden to look at the circumstances in which the -- a
subpoena or any other discovery document is being asked
to enforce it now.  I mean, where does this rule come
from that the district court can't look at the
circumstances now?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I'm not saying the district
court can't look at the circumstances at the time of
enforcement.  There may be circumstances where --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Very well.  Once we say
that, they've asked this question on the merits here.
They say, why in heaven's name have they issued -- why
have they asked this enforcement?  There are only two
possible reasons.  One is to get some information in the
years 2005, 2007 that would show that they owe more
money than you claim they do owe, since you issued a
final thing, which would be impossible because the
statute of limitations has run.
And the other possible reason is that you want to
obtain information to put in the tax court proceeding,
which, in fact, is supported by the fact that the agents
who came to enforce it were tax court lawyers and not
the regular lawyers.  And, in fact, it would be
absolutely illegal under the law -- the rules of the
tax court.  So they said, that's our information.
That's why we think this is oppressive.  And your
response to that is if they're wrong, why do you want
this information?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, we think they're sort
of wrong, wrong, wrong, and wrong.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Very good.  Then you will
explain to me why is it -- why is it that the government
wants this information?  To do what?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Because so -- just to take
a step back.  The courts have upheld that the inquiry is
whether the summonses were issued for a proper purpose.
This Court said in Couch that the legal parties -- the
parties' legal duties are fixed at the time that the
summons was issued.  So if you adopt the type of
approach that they're asking for, what you're going to
do is give taxpayers an incentive not to comply with the
legal duty that's imposed on them by operation of law,
which is to disclose information related to their tax
liabilities, and then to comply with summonses that are
validly issued.  You give them incentive to drag
things out until the statute of limitations is about to
run and they file a tax court --
JUSTICE BREYER:  My question was:  Why do
you want the information?
MS. HARRINGTON:  We want the information
because the IRS wants to make a determination of their
tax liability.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait, wait.  Now, explain
that one to me.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Okay.  So that's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, when you say
information, isn't the final partnership
determination -- the final partnership for the years
2005, 2007, is it you want the information to revise
that?  Is that why you want it?
MS. HARRINGTON:  That is -- I mean, yes.
So --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  So you want the
information --
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, that's a -- that's
one possibility.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to know yes or no.
What are the reasons you want this information?  One is
you want to change the number on the final partnership
assessment of liability.  Is that one of the reasons?
MS. HARRINGTON:  It could be.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes or no, please.
MS. HARRINGTON:  We want the right answer.
And if the right answer is that we were wrong in the
FPAA, then we would revise the FPAA.
JUSTICE BREYER:  You want -- in other words,
I want to be quite precise.  I've asked the question, do
you want the information with the idea in mind that it
might show you should change the final number?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
reason you want the information?
MS. HARRINGTON:  No.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
Is there any other
Thank you.
Justice --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, can I ask you this --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I just go back to
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you this on a
related point.  The IRS has to, as an initial step,
if -- if the person who's subpoenaed resists
enforcement, the IRS has to submit an affidavit saying
it has a proper purpose.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Right?  Suppose that that
affidavit says:  We have a proper purpose and our proper
purpose is solely this:  We want discovery for the Tax
Court case.  In your view -- in your view, is that a
proper purpose?
MS. HARRINGTON:  So I guess -- so the
premise of your question assumes that there is already a
Tax Court proceeding underway?
JUSTICE ALITO:  Right.
MS. HARRINGTON:  And so that may -- that
might not be a proper purpose because the IRS has said
you need extraordinary circumstances -- the internal IRS
guidelines say you need extraordinary circumstances to
issue a summons after Tax Court proceedings are
underway.  And the Tax Court has similarly said you can
only use evidence obtained through those summons in
extraordinary circumstances.  But in almost every case,
a summons is issued long before or at least somewhat
before a Tax Court proceeding is initiated because
it's -- the IRS is trying to get information to make a
determination about the taxpayer's liability.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Well -- so
suppose the -- the answer is this:  We have a proper
purpose.  We have no interest whatsoever in changing our
assessment.  However, we anticipate that there's going
to be a Tax Court proceeding and we want to get
discovery for the Tax Court proceeding.  Is that a
proper purpose?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I think that would be a
question that would need to be decided in a particular
case.  The reason I'm hesitating to give you a straight
answer is because I -- that's just not the way the IRS
works.  The IRS is trying to get the right answer.  And
believe it or not, sometimes when the IRS gets more
information, it will actually give money back to a
taxpayer.  It might -- if it gets information that might
exonerate the IRS's finding of improper liability or it
might actually bring to light to the IRS the fact that
the taxpayer has overpaid.  And there are some case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I go -- interrupt
now, just to get back to the question that Justice Alito
started with earlier and finish it.  What do you mean by
"evidence"?  And -- and I ask this because I'm trying to
figure out whether we're in the Iqbal-Twombly world,
where what you mean by "evidence" is sort of a sworn
complaint that points to facts from which a plausible
inference can be drawn, or whether you're talking about
evidence as a summary judgment standard where they have
to proffer affidavits and show documents and sort of go
through a summary judgment standard.  Because
evidence --
MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- is a -- it -- it has
a lot of meaning and I'm not quite sure which one --
MS. HARRINGTON:  So it's more like summary
judgment than Iqbal.  You know, I don't think summons
enforcement standards exactly map onto any other civil
standard like this.  I'll tell you why we think the
Iqbal standard does not apply.  There's a couple
reasons.
First, the Iqbal-Twombly standard is a
pleading standard, it’s not about what kind of
evidence.  It's -- it's not about production of evidence
to support your pleadings.  And so in this case what
we're saying is it doesn't matter how artfully you plead
that there is an improper purpose; you need to be able
to point to some kind of evidence to support that to
raise an inference of improper purpose.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that -- that means
point to some facts, point to some facts that --
that --
MS. HARRINGTON:  It certainly --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's -- that's why I'm
saying -- I don't know that --
MS. HARRINGTON:  But you can't just allege
things --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let me tell you what I
would have done if I had gotten this.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  If I had
gotten their information, I would have looked at the
government and said:  Explain to me why you need this --
I would have done what Justice Breyer did.  And then I
would have figured out and asked you enough questions,
without holding a hearing, just through your attorney,
until I got to a point where I decided whether or not
your answers, like the district court did here, made
sense or not.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And if they didn't make
sense, then I would say, no, let's go a little further.
MS. HARRINGTON:  And absolutely, we would
say you would have discretion to do that as the district
court.  We -- we're not looking to constrain the
district court's discretion here.  And I think it's
important to keep in mind, another reason that the Iqbal
standard really doesn't work here is that by the time
you're getting to this question about whether there's an
improper purpose, as our opponent has alleged, the
government has already made a substantial showing of
good faith.  The government has filed the Powell
affidavit, a district court has satisfied itself that
the government has established a proper purpose.  And
then the presumption is that the government's acting in
good faith and for a proper purpose.
And so when you're -- in the Iqbal context,
the person who files a complaint is entitled to the
presumption that what they say is true.  It's the
opposite here.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why not -- why not
make life very simple -- and I think that's what your
counterpart -- simply to say you have to point to facts
from which a reasonable inference of improper motive can
be drawn.
MS. HARRINGTON:  That's what we're saying.
That's exactly the standard that we think should have
been applied.  And if it -- and as long as an opponent,
a summons opponent, can do that, can point to facts that
raise an inference of improper purpose, then a district
court needs to allow examination of IRS --
JUSTICE ALITO:  But that doesn't -- that's
doesn't really seem very helpful because there are
inferences and there are inferences.  There are weak
inferences and there are strong inferences.  I don't
think it's very helpful to a district judge for us to
send this back and say:  Figure out whether there is an
inference here of -- of some unspecified strength.
Take the retaliation issue.  You have --
let's say these are the facts.  The -- the IRS asks for
a further extension of the statute of limitations, the
taxpayer says no:  I'm not going to agree to any further
extensions, and then a half an hour later the summons
are served.  So you have one thing happening shortly
after another.  That gives rise to an inference of
retaliation.  Maybe it's a very weak inference; maybe
it's a stronger inference.  Do you see what I'm saying?
We have to specify something other than it gives rise to
an inference of some unspecified strength.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, with respect, Your
Honor, that -- that's the rule that's applied in the 11
other courts of appeals that have jurisdiction over
these matters and it really has not been a problem in
the district courts in those courts of appeals.  It's
only the Eleventh Circuit that has held you don't have
to point to any evidence, you don't have to raise an
inference, a district court has no discretions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, could I --
we hear that argument a lot, that there's never been any
showing of any problem in these other circuits.  But do
you have any study to support that?  I mean, is it -- I
don't know that we -- how you would tell.  I mean,
because these -- these proceedings, not everybody is
going to say I'm going to appeal, particularly facing
the IRS, and go forward.  Do you have any basis for the
argument that this has not been a problem in the other
circuits other than the fact that what, we haven't had a
case yet or the courts of appeals haven't had a case?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I can't point to any study,
but I have to think that if there were serious problems,
you would see a lot more litigation about this issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what do you mean
about a problem?  I mean, some of them are applying a
requirement of a strong inference and others are
applying a requirement of a weak inference.  How is that
a problem?  I mean, you could say no problem, they're
just doing what they want to do.
MS. HARRINGTON:  But none of them is
applying the rule that the Eleven Circuit applies, which
is you don't have to have -- you can just have an
unsupported allegation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh.  We're -- we're way
beyond that.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Okay.  Great.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, not
necessarily great.  One thing that -- when we articulate
a new standard, sometimes we like to apply it to the
particular case to give clearer guidance over exactly
what we mean.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Okay.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And in this case --
and particularly here when we're not being asked to
resolve a legal question in the particular case, we're
just trying to say what do you need to show a hearing --
require a hearing.  They've got more -- you know,
they've got more than just a bare allegation.  They've
got the summons -- first of all, it's the third request
for an extension.  They've got the summons immediately
after they refuse to grant it.  They've got a contention
that this is to circumvent the Tax Court's limits.  They
support that by the fact that when Moog came for the
deposition, you only had the Tax Court lawyers there,
not Mr. Freefielder who was -- Frierfielder, who was
running the investigation.  That's more than just a bare
allegation.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, if I can separate the
two allegations.  On the -- on the statute of
limitations issue --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There were -- there
were three or four, not two.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I'm sorry.  There are
different allegations, but they're sort of two reasons.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Maybe
because it's a tax case, if you could slow down just a
little bit.
MS. HARRINGTON:  I'm sorry.
(Laughter.)
MS. HARRINGTON:  I'm with you.
So the two purposes, improper purposes that
they discussed before this Court, are:  First,
retaliation for refusing to extend the statute of
limitations; and second, circumvention of Tax Court
discovery rules.  So as to the first, again, I think you
need to step back and ask:  Well, would it be an
improper purpose for the IRS to issue a summons after a
taxpayer declines to extend the statute of limitations.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  It's a little
bit more than that.  It's the third request for an
extension.  And how often does the IRS request the
taxpayers to waive the statute of limitations?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I can't give you
statistics, but my understanding is that the IRS does
everything it can to get the information voluntarily and
in a cooperative way from taxpayers before it has to
resort to a summons.  And so that often involves asking
for extensions of the statute of limitations.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I know.  But
Congress has established these statutes of limitations,
and the IRS has enormous leverage.  They're sitting here
saying, well, we could file this thing saying you owe
$150,000 in taxes or you might -- or you could give us
more time and we'll think about it longer.
And my sense, just from looking at the cases
that come in and cert petitions, that happens almost
always.  They're always saying give us more time, give
us more time.  And I don't know how many times it
happens three different times -- I mean three
successive --
MS. HARRINGTON:  To be honest, I don't know
how often that happens either.  I don't think it's
infrequent.  But I think you have to understand it
within the context of the tax system.  This isn't a
system where the obligation is on the IRS to figure out
how much each of us owes and to come after us for that
amount.  The obligation -- Congress has put it on the
taxpayer to determine.  Everyone has to do their own
taxes, figure out how much they owe, and to give
documentary evidence supporting their determination of
how much they owe.  And Congress has also told the IRS,
we want you to go out and inquire into the liabilities
of taxpayers with respect to any tax and figure out if
people are doing this correctly.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And we want you to
do it within whatever the statute of limitations period
is.
MS. HARRINGTON:  That's right.  But if the
-- if the IRS goes to taxpayers, they don't -- they
don't just go to a taxpayer and issue a summons right
off the bat.  They go to a taxpayer, in this case the
partnership.  They made two deductions, questionable
interest deductions totaling $34 million.  The IRS said
we're not sure about this.  They asked for information
that would allow the IRS to determine whether the
deductions were correct.  Now keep in mind--
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just so -- just so I -- I
know what your position is in this case and your answer
to the Chief Justice, is it your contention that on this
showing, that on these affidavits, a district court may
not order a hearing?
MS. HARRINGTON:  No.  We're not offering a
line that a district court would not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  So you say
that the district court -- that there is a sufficient
showing here so that a district court, in the exercise
of its discretion, could order a further hearing.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  I mean, we think
almost any time a district court thinks there's a reason
to hold the hearing, that it would allow examination by
IRS officials --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the problem is, you
say the district court could say, yes, I'm going to --
I'm going to require this agent to testify or no, I'm
not going to.
You're using a discretion test, but you're
not giving the district judges all over the country a
clue about appropriate exercise of that question.  And
if I understand your most recent answer, you're saying
it could go either way, it's up to the district judge.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I mean, I think any
time you're talking about the district court's exercise
of its discretion, you're going to have a range of
situations in which the district court could do A or it
could do the opposite of A, and it wouldn't be an abuse
of discretion either way.  That's the nature of
discretion.
In our view, in this case, if a district
court sees a reason to hold the hearing and allow
examination, it should do that, and the IRS, the
government may argue --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I -- can I ask,
Ms. Harrington, in the 11 circuits that follow what you
think is the right approach, what actually happens?  How
often do courts ask IRS agents to come in and to give
testimony about why they're -- why they've issued a
summons?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I don't have statistics.
It's really hard to get numbers on all of these sort of
numbers-based questions and I apologize for that.  But
my sense is it doesn't happen very often.  But
sometimes --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there was a time when
the government thought that was the right procedure.
The Salter case has been mentioned and there the
government itself made the suggestion that if there's an
allegation, an allegation of improper purpose, the court
should have a hearing at which the taxpayer gets an
opportunity to question the agent.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, Justice Ginsburg,
it's not quite right that -- first of all, we offered
testimony just in that case.  I don't think we offered
that as a rule to govern all cases.  But also, it wasn't
just about any allegation of improper purpose.  It was
about a particular type of purpose that was -- that was
relevant then, which is that an allegation that the IRS
had a criminal investigation only purpose.  And when
Congress enacted TEFRA in 1982, it took that allegation
of improper purpose off the table by sort of drawing --
making irrelevant whether the IRS -- whatever its
internal motivation was, whether it was looking at
criminal or civil liability, it took that off the table.
And so all the courts of appeals from the
'70s and '80s that allowed examination of IRS officials,
as a matter of course or more frequently, all of those
courts of appeals except the Eleventh Circuit changed
their rule after TEFRA was enacted because all of those
holdings were really just about whether the IRS had a
solely criminal investigation purpose.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Harrington, can I go
back?  You said it's rare.  Does that mean it's
really -- it never happens?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I think it happens
sometimes.  It doesn't happen very often.  And again, I
think that's because before you even get to the
question, the IRS has already made a significant showing
through the Powell affidavit.  It has established that
it has a proper purpose.  And the IRS doesn't just say,
we have a proper purpose.  They have to identify the
purpose.  And if you look on pages 24 and 25 of the
Joint Appendix, you will see the purpose that's alleged
in this case, which is looking into these questionable
interest deductions.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  But there's more --
that's why -- what I don't have clear in my mind is how
to write the facts into this.  I mean, before we had our
previous colloquy, I guess they had no idea why you
wanted this information more specifically than you're
saying.  And then you say, quite truthfully -- it only
took three seconds -- and you said no, we want it
because we might want to revise the -- the final
partnership -- final partnership administrative
adjustment.  And then what perhaps they'll say next --
I'm just getting this out of their brief, they’ll say -- in your own
handbook you say, once that's issued, "The examination
has been concluded and the Service should no longer be
in the process of gathering data to support a
determination."
And then they have a whole paragraph full of
similar things from the IRS.  So they'll read them to
you, not you, but the lawyer, and they'll say, well,
what was special about this that you decided to have
this extra examination?  And there'll have to be an
answer to that.  Well, as a -- as a sort of lay person
in this area reading that, that sounds like a good set
of questions to ask.  You'd be interested in what the
answer is and they should be able to ask them.
Now, am I missing something?  Can I say --
would I cause some kind of big problem for something or
it's -- if I were to say in an opinion, look, this is
the kind of thing that they want to know, and it sounds
as if, since we don't know your side of it, but it
sounds as if this is the situation, and they should be
able to find out.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, the problem is that
the IRS seeks the information when it issues the summons
and that happens before the FPAA was issued.  It
happened before there's tax court proceedings.  And so
if you write an opinion that says, well, if you -- you
know, if the -- if the summonses don't get enforced
until after the FPAA is issued and at that point, the
taxpayer is entitled to examine IRS officials, then
you're giving taxpayers an incentive not to comply with
summonses that are validly issued.
Now, the order to show cause was issued by
the district -- excuse me -- that was issued afterwards.  But
the taxpayer has an obligation even before the summonses
are issued to provide information to the IRS to support
its tax liability.  Once the summonses are issued, it
certainly has an even stronger obligation, and just
because that hasn't yet been enforced through the
district court, just because the Respondents refuse to
comply with their obligation --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I am trying to figure out
the difference between the two sides here.  And I guess
you can only answer for half of it.  But I suspect the
difference is you are saying that there is enough
evidence here to allow a district court to exercise its
discretion, but not enough to reverse a district court
if it did not exercise its discretion in favor of
allowing the hearing.  Is that right?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  That's exactly what I
was --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I suspect the other
side will be saying there is not only enough to enable
the district court to make the finding of -- of a
hearing, but there's enough to compel the district court
to do that.  We'll -- we'll see what they say about
that.
MS. HARRINGTON:  If I could reserve the
balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Marod.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD A. MAROD
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MAROD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
A taxpayer is entitled to an
evidentiary -- a limited evidentiary hearing when he
presents specific facts from which an improper purpose
in issuance or enforcement of a summons may plausibly be
inferred from those facts.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you would reverse the
district court here if the district court -- you're --
you're not defending what -- what the court of appeals
said, that you're entitled to a hearing in every case
whenever you -- you say improper motive.  Yes, you
have -- you don't defend that.
MR. MAROD:  If we read the case that
way, I don't defend it.  I read it to say that you look
at pleading standards, including Iqbal, you look at all
of the other cases that it relied upon.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where do we have the --
we have the opinion of the Eleventh Circuit.  Where does
it say that?
MR. MAROD:  It doesn't say those words.  It
says, we made a complete and detailed review of the
entire record.  We are applying pleading standards in
the course of this and we are relying on Nero and -- and
its predecessors, all of which say, for instance, you
can't get this hearing by just saying denied or just
saying I think they were acting with an improper
purpose.  And so therefore, if you put all these things
together in an unpublished opinion that's deciding my
case, we think that that's what the result was of what
they were doing.  But the rule --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I'm -- you
know, what the Eleventh Circuit is doing is a little
confusing to me.  I understand what motivated it.  You
use the word "evidentiary hearing."  In my mind,
evidentiary hearing by definition is live witnesses.  Is
that your definition?
MR. MAROD:  What I'm talking about is a
limited evidentiary hearing and at that hearing there
would be --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So define what "hearing"
means to you.
MR. MAROD:  It could very well be live
witnesses.  It would be up to the discretion of
the court, based on what allegations were made in that
particular case.  But the typical case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's the problem.
I think the Eleventh Circuit means a live hearing
because of its jurisprudence in this area, which has
barred any other kind of evidence to be sought from the
IRS.  It has a case that says you can't have
depositions, you can't have discovery, discovery in its
traditional sense, documents or other things.  But I
don't know; has it also said you can't have affidavits.
MR. MAROD:  No.  It doesn't say you can't
have affidavits, and we have provided affidavits --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not you.  Them, the IRS.
MR. MAROD:  Right.  No, the Eleventh Circuit
has not said you can't present evidence by means of
affidavits in order to try and support your position.
What it has said --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not you.  I'm talking
about the government, because I started by asking you,
are you looking to cross-examine IRS agents.
MR. MAROD:  We believe that what the
Eleventh Circuit says we have the right to do and what
we want to do is to get at least Mary Frierfelder in so
that we can cross-examine her --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what I thought
you --
MR. MAROD:  -- with respect to her
affidavit, which we have serious doubts about.
Now, as Ms. Harrington indicates, the
taxpayer does have a duty to provide information to the
IRS, but in this particular case what doesn't appear in
the record is that the IRS lived at Dynamo for 2 years
before these requests for enlargement of time.  They
weren't doing anything for a long period of time.  As we
indicated in our submissions, our allegations, our
affidavits, they didn't do anything for a long period of
time.  Then they suddenly asked for a new extension of
the statute of limitations.  Then when we denied it,
they promptly filed these summonses and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In Powell we said
similar allegations weren't enough.  The fact that the
documents had already been reviewed or that the statute
of limitations has passed, that that wasn't enough.  So
what have you given us that -- here, what have you
alleged that's greater than Powell?
MR. MAROD:  All right.  We're not saying
it's because the statute of limitations has passed.
We're saying it's because the FPAA has been issued; and
the FPAA, according to the statute, you are only
permitted one FPAA.  You can't go back and modify or
amend the FPAA.  Once you've done that, as Justice
Breyer indicates, the matter is completed in terms of
the examination.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's just the opposite
of what Ms. Harrington told us.  She said the only
purpose of enforcing these subpoenas was the possibility
of amending the FPAA.  I thought I understood her to
have said that.
MR. MAROD:  Ms. Harrington said that that
was what she thought one possibility might be.
We contend they cannot amend the FPAA.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I think she said it was the
possibility.  I asked her. If there were others, she didn't
say any others.
MR. MAROD:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But there will be an
argument whether they can or can't.
MR. MAROD:  Right.  We believe the law makes
it clear that they can't amend the FPAA and that once
the FPAA is issued, the possibility of amendment of
what's in there moves to a court.  It either moves to
the Federal Court of Claims or it moves to a district
court, a bankruptcy court or the Tax Court.  And when
someone is asked to pay as much money as was asked for
in this case, the Tax Court is the logical place to go
because it's the only one you can go to without first
paying all the money and try to challenge --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could you have said in
the Tax Court -- now that the proceeding has begun in
the Tax Court -- say, Tax Court, there is -- the
subpoenas, they are attempting to get information that
they could not have gotten from this court through
discovery.  So, court, say no enforcement.
MR. MAROD:  Correct.  We're saying --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did you ask -- I mean,
that would be a possibility.  You're saying that once
the case shifts to the Tax Court, it should be the Tax
Court judgment, not a district court reviewing the
subpoena.
MR. MAROD:  I understand.  We can't ask the
Tax Court to not enforce the summonses, because Congress
has given exclusive jurisdiction to enforce or not
enforce summonses to the district court and, in fact,
the Ash case that Ms. Harrington referenced actually
held, we don't have jurisdiction to determine whether
these should be enforced or shouldn't be enforced.  If
they go ahead and allow them to be enforced and the
information is gathered, we will then consider the
information that is gathered for whether it is
admissible or not admissible under rules of evidence in
a particular case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The "we" is who?  The "we"
is the Tax Court?
MR. MAROD:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whose words are you
repeating?
MR. MAROD:  The words of the Ash case from
the Tax Court.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So it's the Tax
Court that's talking?
MR. MAROD:  Correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you know offhand what is
the provision of law in which you rely for the
proposition that the FPAA cannot be amended?
MR. MAROD:  It's 26 U.S.C. 6223 sub (f).
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you say that again?
MR. MAROD:  Yes.  6223 sub (f).
JUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you.
MR. MAROD:  So our belief is that once the
Tax Court case has begun, all discovery in that case
should be there, and we have already said that when --
that once that case started was the first time they
tried to enforce these summonses.  The summonses were
issued back in October and September of 2010.  They
weren't obeyed back in 2010.  The IRS manual says, and I
know it's not the force of law, but it does say what the
IRS says, which is, if they don't perform the summonses,
you must come in and seek enforcement of that summons
within 3 days, and then it moves up the channel and then
you must pursue that as quickly as you can, and they
didn't do that.
Nothing happened in terms of trying to
enforce these summonses at any time until the FPAA was
issued.  In addition to that, we know that the FPAA that
was issued on December 28 of 2010 was actually signed by
this agent on August 11th of 2010 and was issued without
any change.
And so what we're looking at here is an
agent who has finished the FPAA in August, suddenly
issues summonses in September and October; when they're
not performed, doesn't try to get them enforced because
if she had wanted that information for the purpose of
completing her FPAA, which she had already completed and
might be considering revising, she didn't do that and
she had the opportunity to do that, and she was implored
by the IRS manual to do those things and she didn't do
those things.
Then the FPAA goes out, we file a Tax Court
case, they answer.  A month later is the first time that
we get any indication from them that they want to try
and enforce these summonses, and what they are looking
for is documentation that they could easily get through
a request for production of documents in the Tax Court.
The only problem in the Tax Court with getting those
documents would be it would be subject to a scope
objection with respect to discovery; whereas, under a
summons there is no objection to scope.  They can ask
for anything that they want that has anything to do with
the finances of the particular taxpayer, and that's why
we make the analogy to Rule 2004 of the Bankruptcy Court
Rules, where trustees and creditors and other parties in
interest can ask for information about the finances of
the debtor without any limitations on what they can ask.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just want to make sure I
understand.  The district court has in front of it a
request to enforce a subpoena.  The district court has
no authority at all, either on its own motion or by
request from the taxpayer, to limit that scope, the
scope of discovery?  Millions of documents, he just has
to sign it?  Is that what I'm hearing?
MR. MAROD:  There are cases in which
district courts have, in fact, limited the scope of
summonses.  In the typical enforcement of a summons, if
they serve you with a summons, you are not entitled even
to have a lawyer at the examination.  You have to give
them everything.  If you don't give them everything or
make an excuse why there isn't -- that something doesn't
exist, then you are into these enforcement proceedings
and then you have to go into that litigation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You are in the litigation,
in that litigation in the district court.  Once you are
before the district court, you can make an objection as
to excessive scope.
MR. MAROD:  Yes.  We didn't make an
objection as to scope because they made such a broad
FPAA -- or they were making such broad allegations at
the time these summonses initially came out, and they
were making such broad allegations in the Tax Court,
that that would not be successful, and we don't think
that the district court should be deciding what the
correct scope is.  That is something that the Tax Court
should be deciding based on what the issues are in the
Tax Court.  The Tax Court was designed to especially
know about all of these issues that come up relating to
tax returns and examination of tax returns and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But at the point where
the summons is sought to be enforced, it may be that
there is no Tax Court proceeding yet, and there may be
never any Tax Court proceeding.  So how can the district
judge make the ruling predicting the future course?
MR. MAROD:  I don't think it can, Your
Honor.  I -- I don't believe that if -- if these
summonses had been -- if enforcement proceedings had
been begun in 2010 before the FPAA had been issued,
before any tax court proceeding had begun, that we could
at that time in good faith have signed the paper under
Rule 11 saying they're only going to use this for the
use in the tax court, they're not going to use it for
the FPAA.  We haven't -- we hadn't seen the August 11th
FPAA that was signed by Ms. Frierfelder until after it
was issued in December of 2010.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is it that you
want to ask -- I suspect at this hearing you want to
call her?
MR. MAROD:  Absolutely.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you want to
ask her?
MR. MAROD:  I want to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Without -- without
giving up your --
MR. MAROD:  No.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Without giving up
the element of surprise.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what general
areas of inquiry would you like to explore?
MR. MAROD:  I'm pretty sure the surprise is
gone at this point, Your Honor.  But why did you delay
in issuing these summonses until the very end of this
case, of the statute of limitations period, when you had
had people in the store for two years looking at
everything that was available.  Why did you delay?
Why did you sign the FPAA, which is your
Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment, on August
11th of 2010, if you hadn't completed your examination
already?  When did you send this Final Partnership
Administrative Adjustment up to be issued? The way I
understand this works, it has to go up through the
ranks, she can't just issue the FPAA herself, it has to
be issued out of Washington, D.C.
And, of course, the last one would be
questions related to and what role would the enforcement
of these summonses have in helping your examination,
which is one of the two purposes that might possibly
apply to this case, in view of the fact that there's a
tax court case pending and an FPAA has already been
filed.  What could you possibly use this for in the course
of your examination of these tax returns for 2005 to
2000 --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that if
those are the questions you're going to ask, that almost
every taxpayer's lawyer could ask those questions in
almost every subpoena case.  I'm -- I'm now concerned, I
thought that there was agreement.  I now think there's
much more to the government's position than I had
thought with reference to harassment.  I think you can
ask that in any tax case I've ever heard of.
MR. MAROD:  Well, until the FPAA has already
been issued, I'm sure you can't ask it.  And in most of
these cases, the summonses are being enforced long
before the statute of limitations comes.  If -- if you
look even at the tax advocate report that is included in
the reply brief of the -- referenced in the reply brief
of the government in this case, you see that there were
117 cases that were -- had reported decisions over the
last year.  And it lists who was represented and who
wasn't, and almost no one was represented.  It simply
was 12 people had lawyers, and only a couple of them
resulted in IRS -- in the IRS losing.  They said we
lost, that they lost in this case.  We're not sure that
they've lost yet.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just to be clear on what
you're -- what you're asking us to do.  You want us to
affirm the judgment on -- but on a different basis --
well, on -- you do not concede it's a different basis.
But the reason you want us to confirm the judgment --
affirm the judgment below is that, in your view, it
would be an abuse of discretion for the district court
not to have the -- the hearing.
MR. MAROD:  The preliminary hearing,
correct.  The limited --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It would be an abuse of
discretion not to do it on the facts of this case.
MR. MAROD:  We believe it would be an abuse
of discretion not to do it on the facts of this case
because on the pleading standards established in Iqbal
and Twombly, we did it in allegations and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If I look at the statute
you cited and come to a contrary conclusion, you're
right, it takes a showing of fraud -- what's the
words -- fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation of a
material fact --
MR. MAROD:  That's correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- to amend a Final
Partnership Administrative Adjustment notice.
MR. MAROD:  And I apologize.  That's true.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But since -- yes, but
that's a really big issue, because I think an IRS agent
who says I want to make sure there's none of those
things and that's why I'm issuing the subpoena has a
legitimate basis.  So if I don't think it's an abuse of
discretion or that you showed me much with respect to
that issue, what's left for you?  What -- what other
fact would you -- could you plausibly have stated?
Because we already said in Powell that the expiration of
the statute of limitations doesn't make a difference.
MR. MAROD:  Correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They can always have a
legitimate statement of wanting to make sure that none
of those three things happened.  So what else in your
allegations stands up?
MR. MAROD:  Well, I'm not sure it's in my
allegation.  I think it's in the affidavit.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In the facts.  Yes, all
right.  So what -- I'm sorry.
MR. MAROD:  The affidavit that was
submitted --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  The evidence
that was submitted.
MR. MAROD:  -- by Frierfelder --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What else?
MR. MAROD:  -- which said -- which said I
wanted to complete this examination and never mentioned
anything about fraud or malfeasance, none of which have
been even hinted about or suggested in this case as far
as we're aware.
Now, that would be something -- there's this
-- always this dual purpose problem that we have with
the enforcement of these summonses.  If a summons has a
proper purpose and an improper purpose, I'm not sure we
can possibly win in that situation.  When we go to this
preliminary hearing, we're trying to develop what
evidence we can from the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's an IRS
regulation that says they can't use it in the
criminal -- in a criminal prosecution.
MR. MAROD:  Correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So even if it was a dual
purpose, what difference does it make since they can't
use it?
MR. MAROD:  Well, it's not the dual purpose
-- that's not the dual purpose I'm talking about.  The
dual purpose that I'm talking about is, for instance, to
use this evidence solely in the tax court after the tax
court case has been filed, after the FPAA has been
issued.  Just -- Mary Frierfelder did not say that she
was going to use this to try and investigate a fraud or
a malfeasance or anything else like that.  She only said
she wanted it -- she didn't say why she wanted it.  She
said she had examined the tax returns and she had issued
the FPAA and a tax court case is underway and seems to
be just buying into the idea that the IRS has, which is
that as long as you issue your summons before the FPAA
comes out and a tax court case starts, you can enforce
it no matter what.  There's no --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In your -- in your
experience, how often does the IRS ask a taxpayer to
waive the statute of limitations?
MR. MAROD:  Too much.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suspect that's
your judgment.  But in your experience, how often do
they do it?
MR. MAROD:  I'd have to confer with my tax
counsel, but in almost every significant case, they will
ask for at least one extension of the statute of
limitations.  They -- all right.
Now, going back to Powell, which --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And what normally happens
if you say no?
MR. MAROD:  Usually they go forward and
issue their Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment
or their statutory notice of deficiency within the time
that's permitted.  Or if they don't think they've got a
problem, they let it go.  That almost never happens, but
the statutory notice of deficiency or the FPAA will come
out.  You usually don't get, when you're nearing the end
of the statute of limitations, a raft of summonses like
this, except apparently in this case and in this
particular district where it happens quite a bit.
We think that the rules set forth relating
to grand jury subpoenas not being able to be used to
bolster a criminal case after an indictment has already
been issued is universally accepted.  We think that the
Rule 2004 rule relating to bankruptcy subpoenas, which
says that the bankruptcy subpoena can no longer be
enforced once litigation is underway between the
discovering party and the non-discovering party about
the subject of the actual subpoena is universally
accepted.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you told me before, I
think, that the tax court can stop it.  I asked you a
question, could the tax court say now we're in court,
any information has to be in compliance with the scope
of discovery we allow.  You said because there's a
separation and the summons is enforced by the district
court, the tax court will do nothing and indeed will
accept the information that is made available as a
result of the summons.
MR. MAROD:  We believe that that is
ordinarily true.  We can always make an argument to try
and prevent particular evidence from coming in in the
tax court, but we can't absolutely know that we're going
to be able to stop it in the tax court.  It's going to
be up to them to decide whether to accept the
information.
The real issue in this case isn't the documents; it's the
examination.  The examination that the IRS wants to take
is an examination that basically has no strictures.  It
has no absolute right for counsel to be in attendance.
It has no right for cross-examination.  It has no limits
on what the scope of the examination can be.  It can be
what is referenced in a lot of the cases about IRS
summonses, a fishing expedition.
And that's what the IRS wants to do here.
And we're positive about that because of the way they've
been pursuing this, including the deposition taken of
Ms. Moog by -- that Mr. Supinski attended.  He was
permitted to attend.  We weren't invited to attend.
The matter was -- ultimately came out that
they didn't get much from Ms. Moog.  I'm sure that's why
she agreed to go ahead and give that deposition.  But we
couldn't insist on being there.  We couldn't have
insisted on cross-examining her.  And what the IRS
attorney who's handling the Tax Court case we're
positive wants to do, from all the things that have
happened in that case, is to get the examinations of the
individuals who were summoned without us being able to
control it and without us being able to examine at
those -- at those examinations.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you agree with
Ms. Harrington that the Salter case, where the
government said in Salter, the First Circuit case, that
the way to proceed is call -- call the agent?
Ms. Harrington said, if I remember correctly, that the
Salter decision became academic when TEFRA passed.
Do you agree with that?
MR. MAROD:  I do not agree with that.  We
believe that, as Nero said, and I believe it was
footnote 4 of Nero, that the TEFRA enactment only
affected issues relating to potential abuse of process
relating to criminal prosecutions, and -- and it was to
resolve a problem that was created by the decision
that you couldn't go based on the intention of a single
agent having an intention of pursuing criminal
prosecution.  You had to look at the institutional
intention of the IRS.  And that meant you had to take
the testimony of everybody in the IRS to establish what
the institutional intention was.
That got eliminated by TEFRA, because now it
has to be -- there's a referral or there is not a
referral, and otherwise that issue doesn't come up.  But
it doesn't deal with the situation in which Powell says
we're entitled to show at a meaningful adversary hearing
anything else showing abuse of the court process.  And
that means abuse of the district court's process.
And to us, the use of the district court's
process in enforcing an IRS summons that's supposed to
be used only for examinations, one of which has already
been completed, solely for the purpose of evading the
rules of the -- of the Tax Court that control discovery
is an abuse of process.  And we believe that that's what
all the 2004 cases talk about, the Rule 2004 cases,
Szadkowski, Bennett Funding, and Snyder, which I believe
we've -- we've cited in our briefs.
We believe that if we don't get the ability
to come forward with allegations that under Iqbal and
Twombly would pass muster to support our allegations,
that we're going to go back into the impermissible
Catch-22 that the -- that the Eleventh Circuit talks
about, and there'll be an unreasonable circular burden
because we have to have evidence to get evidence, and we
can't get the evidence without already having the evidence.
In our case, with respect to the evasion of
the Tax Court rules, we believe that we already
presented enough evidence, but the trial court judge
didn't even look at that evidence and said that you
absolutely -- that's -- as a matter of law, that can't
possibly be a defense to these summonses.
Congress intended the courts to be a check
on abusive use of administrative summonses.  We believe
that these -- that we have shown by allegations and by
our evidence that these were abusive attempts to use
these administrative summonses.  We believe that the
judgment of the Eleventh Circuit should be affirmed, and
if necessary to clarify what appears that -- a rule
clarifying it as I've indicated with requiring pleadings
that would pass muster under Iqbal would get you the
entitlement of a preliminary hearing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
4 minutes, Ms. Harrington.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. HARRINGTON:  Thank you.  If I just --
I'd like to start by clarifying the finality of the FPAA
issue.  I tried to be very careful in my answer to
Justice Breyer, and if I misspoke I apologize.  What I
intended to say or what I wanted to say was that the
ongoing issue for the IRS is -- it might amend its final
determination of liability for the taxpayer.  Once
you're in the Tax Court, that happens in the Tax Court,
not by amending the FPAA, and I didn't mean to suggest
otherwise.
But -- so thinking about the Tax Court --
Tax Court, once you have the proceedings going there,
the Tax Court itself has said that if you have a summons
that was issued before the FPAA, it can be helpful to
have that summons enforced because the information that
would be acquired through enforcing that summons would
be relevant to the ultimate question in the Tax Court.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean, if you change it to that,
the only reason there that she in her affidavit, the
agent, just says she wants the information to help
decide the tax liability.  She doesn't say anything
specific.  So you're saying the reason we wanted it is
we wanted to change the tax liability possibly.  That's
a matter in the Tax Court.  And therefore, you wanted it
for the Tax Court.
So now there's a question.  Can you use a
subpoena enforced through a court to get information
that you, I think, are saying -- correct me if I'm not
right -- has no purpose other than to change, modify, or
help our case in the Tax Court.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, that is the reason
for enforcing the summons.  That was not the reason for
issuing the summons.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I realize that.
MS. HARRINGTON:  And Powell has pointed to
the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So if that is the only
reason for enforcing the summons, I don't know, is there
any more need for a hearing?  I mean, it's a legal
question.
MS. HARRINGTON:  And the Tax Court has said
that issuing a summons in that circumstance doesn't
offend anything that's happening in the Tax Court.  As
Justice Ginsburg said --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You said you can get
information to help their case or change the liability
in the Tax Court.  And they say you can't.
MS. HARRINGTON:  And they can go, as Justice
Ginsburg suggested, they can go to the tax --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't think we can decide
that, can we?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, they can go to the
Tax Court and say:  Look, we don't think this
information should be included.  That's what happens in
the grand jury cases they cite.  They don't try -- you
don't go and quash a grand jury subpoena.  What you do
is you go in your criminal case in the district court
and say:  You shouldn't use that information because it
was obtained pursuant to a subpoena that was improperly
issued.
Now, the taxpayer -- it's the taxpayer's
duty to establish that the deductions it's taking are
justified.  And in this case, the IRS didn't have enough
information to make its own determination about that.
And so what it decided was the taxpayer hadn't met its
burden, and it issued the FPAA.  And the IRS is entitled
to take that protective step if the -- if the taxpayer
is refusing to turn over information.
Now, Respondents sort of pointed to several
questions that they might want to ask the IRS agent who
issued the summons.  Those questions are clearly not
relevant to the purpose for issuing the summons.  Again,
they just go to the purpose for enforcing the summons.
And just one last point on Iqbal.  We really
don't think Iqbal applies here, because in this -- in
this instance, what you are talking about is you already
have a showing by the IRS that it has a proper purpose.
And a district court is not going to issue an order to
show cause unless the district court is satisfied that
the IRS has established a proper purpose.
And so the presumptions shift, are the
opposite of Iqbal in that context.  In that context,
there's a presumption that the IRS has a proper purpose.
And this Court said in the LaSalle National Bank case
that then the duty is on the summons opponent to
disprove a proper purpose.  And so the opponent isn't
entitled to a presumption that what they say is correct.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So could you say a little
bit more, Ms. Harrington, about what -- what kind of
evidence would overcome the presumption in a particular
case?
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, so this Court
identified in Powell two potential improper purposes:
One would be harassment and one is an attempt to kind of
leverage a settlement in a collateral matter.  And I
think to take the second one, if the IRS were really
trying to pressure a taxpayer into settling a collateral
matter, the IRS would have some evidence of that;
otherwise, it would be a pretty ineffective attempt to
leverage a settlement.  So they're going to have some
communications from the IRS or something like that, and
the taxpayer can submit affidavits or any kind of
documentary evidence that's in the taxpayer's possession
or the summons recipient's position to the district
court and then the district court has discretion if it
wants to hear more from the IRS, to ask for that more
information in whatever way it deems appropriate.
Thank you.
