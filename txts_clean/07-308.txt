CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Elkhorn Mining Company.
Mr. Jay.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Respondent sought and received a full refund
of the tax they paid on exported coal for the full
three-year period permitted them by the tax-refund
statute. What the court of appeals' decision permitted
them to do was to bring an additional action for
indistinguishable relief, but for a three-year period
beyond what the tax-refund statute permits.
We submit that that decision was erroneous
for two principal reasons: First, the plaintiff --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It might help if you
raise that lectern a bit.
MR. JAY: Hang on.
Is that better, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, thank you.
MR. JAY: Thank you.
The plain and unabiguous terms of the
tax-refund statute, section 7422(a), expressly provide
that any claimant who alleges that a tax has been
illegally assessed, no matter the reason, must before
proceeding to court file a refund claim with the
Internal Revenue Service within three years after filing
the tax return on which the illegal tax was paid.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jay, is the government
running with the fox and chasing with the hounds? You
want us to apply the provisions governing the Internal
Revenue Code with regard to whether the statute has
expired, but when it comes to interest you say oh, no,
no, no, that doesn't apply. Why? Why shouldn't the two
go pari passu, as we say?
MR. JAY: Well, we think, Your Honor, that
the interest provision is in fact a key part of the
tax-refund statute and so Respondent's attempt to invoke
the tax-refund judgment interest provision is
inconsistent with their theory, that they're proceeding
outside the scope of the tax ---
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, they make the same
mistake, but that doesn't justify your making the same,
the same mistake.
MR. JAY: Well, we think, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's either, you
know, they're both in one pot or they're both in the
other pot. And both sides want to -- want to split them
up, but why don't they go together?
MR. JAY: Well, we think the whole case is
in the Title 26 pot, Your Honor, that the whole case
should proceed under the provisions of Title 26, meaning
that Respondents have already received the full tax
refund to which they are entitled. And to be sure, they
received interest on that refund. And had they to sue
for it, they would have received interest under section
11. But because they are -- because they are no
longer able to proceed under the exclusive tax-refund
procedure, of course we think that they -- that they
can't plead around that by claiming constitutional
damages instead.
But if the Court were to agree with them and
agree that they could pursue damages for a violation of
the Export Clause, section 2411 does not apply to such a
claim because it's not a claim for an overpayment of
tax. The term "overpayment" in the interest statute
ties back to the section 6402, which is the linchpin of
the tax-refund statute. And the -- when a taxpayer has
made an overpayment, that triggers the obligation of the
IRS to provide a tax refund if one is timely sought, and
if one isn't timely sought, as this Court recognized in
the Brockamp case, the Congress has provided an
unusually emphatic limitation on the Commissioner's
ability to refund.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can you explain one thing
to me? I take it that they -- everybody says they went
through all the right IRS hoops to get back three years'
worth of damages, i.e., they get their payments back and
they get interest.
MR. JAY: That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what they want is they
want three years before that.
MR. JAY: That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER: And they're too late under
Title 26. So what you're saying is, one, you can't get
any interest and, two, you can't get your money back at
all.
MR. JAY: Well, on the interest, Your Honor,
we're saying that they were entitled to the interest on
the three years.
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying for three years
they're home-free. They get their payment back and they
get their interest. Now let's go to the three preceding
years. I'm a little confused about that because I can't
work out -- I suppose that the government is saying:
You get nothing, you don't get your money back, and you
don't get your interest. Or is the government saying:
You get your money back; you just don't get the
interest? Which is it? And I don't see how it could be
the latter.
MR. JAY: It is the former, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MR. JAY: -- because we're saying that
because Respondents waited for 21 years while paying the
tax without -- without filing a refund claim, that
they're limited to the three years immediately preceding
the refund claim --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. I thought you were
making a second argument, that even if they were
entitled to it despite the statute, they wouldn't be
entitled to interest. You don't make that claim?
MR. JAY: No. If they were entitled to sue,
not under the tax -- under the tax code at all, but on
the theory countenanced by the court of appeals, that
this is not a suit for a tax refund at all, but a suit
for damages arising directly under the Constitution --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.
MR. JAY: -- then there is no provision in
Title 28 or anywhere else that provides the required
express provision --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. JAY: -- of interest that's necessary to
award interest against the government.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right. Okay.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why shouldn't it be a
suit contesting the constitutionality? I mean, in the
usual case where you seek a refund, there are
adjustments that have to be made. But here, if the only
question is the constitutionality of the tax, then what
is the point of going through any kind of administrative
process of the refund route?
MR. JAY: In the context of the coal tax,
Your Honor, and the Export Clause claim, the purpose of
requiring exhaustion, requiring Respondents to proceed
before the IRS, is that the coal tax is exempt from
taxation under the Constitution only if the coal at the
moment the tax is imposed, which in this case is when
it's first sold by the manufacturer, the mining company,
if at that moment, the coal was in the stream of export.
And in the context of the coal industry that can be a
fairly fact-specific question, and the IRS technical
advice memorandum that we've cited on page 11 of our
reply brief explains that to some degree. So it's
possible for a timely refund claim to allow the IRS to
examine the facts and circumstances of the transaction
and determine whether in fact the coal was in the stream
of export at all.
Further, the IRS -- if it has only an excise
tax return from the taxpayer, IRS has no idea what
percentage of that coal was exported. Well over 90
percent of the coal mined in the United States remains
in the United States and there's nothing on Form 720,
the excite tax return, that specifies how much of that
coal is exported. So effectively by filing the two-page
refund claim the taxpayer puts the IRS on notice of what
percentage of coal in the given years was in fact in the
stream of export when it was sold, whether in fact the
broker or whoever purchased it actually purchased it,
actually exported it from the country, and also how --
what the dollar amount of tax refund is being sought.
So all of those, we think, are perfectly
valid purposes for requiring a short but reasonable time
to proceed before the IRS. And if the IRS denies the
claim, then of course Respondents could have proceeded
directly to court.
The IRS did not in fact deny their claim,
and the IRS has issued a notice of acquiescence
specifying that the coal tax -- coal taxpayers who paid
this coal tax and filed timely refund claims will
receive a refund to the full extent that Congress has
permitted the IRS to grant refunds.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Plus interest.
MR. JAY: Plus interest, that's right, Your
Honor. Under section 6611, interest is fully available
on refunds. And again, if the -- if the IRS had denied
the claims and Respondents had been forced to go to
court, they would have received interest accounting for
that time delay as well.
So we think that Section 7422 is the
exclusive means of bringing a claim that a tax was
illegally or erroneously assessed or collected. The
terms of the statute are clear; they're unambiguous; and
they're exclusive. 7422(a) simply is the only way of
bringing this claim.
And we think that whether Respondents
denominate their claim as a statutory-refund claim or a
constitutional claim, the terms of section 7244(a)
plainly cover it. So we think that the Court need not
necessarily answer the question of whether the Export
Clause creates a self-enforcing cause of action at all.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could the IRS say
that the statute -- or Congress, I guess, say the
statute of limitations is one month?
MR. JAY: To file a timely refund claim,
Your Honor?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, and anything
after that, any constitutional violation after that, is
just not remediable?
MR. JAY: Well, the constitutional violation
would have taken place before in Your Honor's
hypothetical.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Five weeks before.
MR. JAY: In the McKesson case, Your Honor,
the Court outlined a number of the options that taxing
authorities have to respect their strong fiscal interest
in the stability of their tax revenues while providing
appropriate relief. And the Court listed as one way in
which States can -- States and other taxing authorities
can protect that by providing a short statute of
limitations. The Court also suggested that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're talking about
-- we're talking about the Constitution here. And in
effect -- I mean, I assume I could run through the usual
routine. I mean, you wouldn't say they could have a
statute of limitations of two days, right?
MR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, in McKesson the
Court pointed to another alternative, which is requiring
that the tax be paid under protest. And that
effectively is a statute of limitations of zero days, in
that when -- you know, that when the tax is paid, the
taxpayer has to identify the basis of the constitutional
challenge and the amount being paid under protest.
And under -- and before the Tucker Act, and
indeed in the early years of the Tucker Act, taxes had
to be paid under protest or the taxpayer was out, was
out the remedy against the collector. And Congress has
since provided that in general taxpayers don't have to
pay their taxes under protest. Instead, they can bring
a refund claim within three years afterwards.  But that
three-year limitation period, while relatively generous,
is absolute.
And the Court held in the Brockamp case that
the three years can't be extended, not even for an
individual taxpayer suffering from senile dementia for
the entire time period.
JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think there are any
circumstances in which a taxpayer can bring a claim
under the Tucker Act for the refund of an
unconstitutional tax?
MR. JAY: Well, we think -- I want to
clarify, Your Honor, that any lawsuit, whether it's on
Respondent's theory or on our theory, any lawsuit that's
filed is in fact under the Tucker Act.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, any situation in which
such a suit can be brought without having filed a claim
previously with the IRS?
MR. JAY: If the only -- if the only basis
for the taxpayers' recovery is that the taxpayer has
paid a tax and the tax was illegally or erroneously
assessed because it was unconstitutional, we think that
section 7422(a) and the associated time limits provide
the procedure for recovering under the Tucker Act.
Section 2501, which is what Respondents
contend is the only procedure that applies to the claims
that they have brought, section 2501, as the Court
recognized --
JUSTICE ALITO: Just to be clear, so your
argument is not limited to the Export Clause. It
doesn't matter what provision of the Constitution the
tax violates. The same rule would apply?
MR. JAY: Well, the Congress has made no
distinction in the statute between one type of
constitutional claim and another, or indeed one type of
illegality or another. And we've cited some -- some
examples in our opening brief of numerous constitutional
provisions that taxpayers may bring challenges under.
And there are at least five clauses in the original
Constitution that regulate the Federal Government's
taxing authority. There are at least four more that
regulate the States, and, you know, not to mention the
Bill of Rights.
So constitutional claims are commonly
brought by taxpayers against Federal taxes, and the
tax-refund procedure provides a full -- a fully
effective, fully adequate way of vindicating that right.
The only requirement is that it be submitted in writing
to the IRS within three years after filing the tax
return in question.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you know, what happened
before the Tucker Act with inverse condemnation claims?
The government violates the Fifth Amendment Takings
Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment Takings Clause
applied to the Fifth by inverse condemnation, and there
is no Tucker Act. Was there a constitutional cause of
action for damages?
MR. JAY: Before there was the Tucker Act,
Your Honor, when the government took property and was
obliged to pay compensation, the claim was presented to
Congress; and Congress could legislative relief by a
private bill.
Eventually, Congress created the Court of
Claims purely as an Article I tribunal. There was no
judicial review because the decisions were always
subject to revision by Congress. And eventually
Congress, having tired of adjudicating all these claims
in a legislative manner, gave the Court of Claims
independent status with its decisions reviewable in
Article III courts. And so, by enacting the Tucker Act,
takings claims became brought in the Court of Federal
Claims.
So, because we think Section 7422(a) is a
completely adequate remedy for any constitutional claim
that Respondents might bring, we submit that this
Court's Bivens cases and this Court's unlawful-tax cases
show that there is no warrant to create a new cause of
action directly under the Constitution in circumstances
like this where the taxpayer has a fully effective
remedy, allows that remedy to become time-barred, but
instead brings a claim, purportedly under the
Constitution, against the identical defendant, in the
identical forum seeking the identical relief. Under
those circumstances, this Court has never fashioned a
Bivens-type implied cause of action for a violation of
the Constitution.
Indeed, in Bush versus Lucas, Schweiker
versus Chilicky, and other cases, the Court has
recognized that when Congress has legislated a remedial
scheme, it doesn't -- this Court will still stay its
hand before creating a new Bivens action, even if that
remedial scheme has very short time limits, such as the
-day time limit, the civil service remedies that were
at issue in Bush, or the exhaustion requirement of Title
VII which substitutes for an equal-protection claim for
Federal employees.
Even in those circumstances, and even if the
remedies that are available are equitable and not money
damages, even in those circumstances this Court will not
create a new cause of action for money damages. And in
this case, if Respondents had filed in a timely way in
this -- referring to the relief that they're seeking in
this case, they're seeking relief for 1994, 1995 and
96. If they had filed by April 30th, 1997, by which
point Cyprus Amex Coal Company was already vigorously
litigating the constitutionality of the Cole excise tax
in the Court of Federal Claims, if they had filed by
that time, they could have received full relief.
So their failure to assert their rights in a
timely way certainly didn't give the court of appeals
warrant to create a new Bivens-type implied right of
action.
If the Court has no further questions at
this time, I'll reserve.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. JAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This is a question of statutory construction
and the problem, as this Court's precedent has made
clear in Enochs versus Williams Packing, is that if
government -- if the government wants to enjoy the
special, extraordinary protections of the tax-refund
scheme, it has to assert a plausible basis for tax
liability. It hasn't done that here. There was never
any claim that they have any legitimate right to this
revenue as a source, as a basis, for taxes; that they
have any legitimate tax regulatory power over this
export process; or that they have any legitimate basis
for defending the statute as constitutional under any
circumstances of the law --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Millett, if it was --
if it was that obvious, why did it take so long for the
coal companies to realize that the government owed them
money?
MS. MILLETT: Justice Stevens, that's
because my clients are not Fortune 100 companies, and I
don't think the Constitution or the Congress imposes a
tax or tax code that require that sort of level of
scrutiny.
I've got -- we've clients here that are
small. They have no in-house lawyers and they had
accountants who paid the taxes. And so the short answer
is they didn't notice.
It's not that they looked at it and thought
it was constitutional. One thing that is clear is that
as soon as anybody looked at this statute, as soon as
anybody -- the courts, the government that collected the
tax for 20 years and did have a constitutional duty to
look at the Constitution, as soon as anyone looked at
it, there was no defense offered. This is an
extraordinary case, where the government made no effort
to defend this tax whatsoever in district court.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there any other cases
where they said, well, it's not in the stream of
commerce yet, and there was an intermediate broker, or
anything like that? Are there any complexities like
that?
MS. MILLETT: Justice Kennedy, there is a
statutory definition, 26 U.S.C. 1421, that deals with
stream of commerce and it mirrors this Court's decision
in the A.G. Spalding case, which says that either the
direct sales or if your manufacturer doesn't sell
directly to the exporter or it has the broker, so one or
two steps, is stream of commerce, and after that it's
not going to be. That's the same thing this Court did
in A.G. Spaulding.
If someone wanted to fight about that
statutory application, they wouldn't be raising a
constitutional claim like we are here. What happened --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in none of these cases
did they have those sorts of problems?
MS. MILLETT: Not in these cases. My
clients -- I think almost in all of the claims they
directly exported it themselves. There was no dispute
whatsoever.
If there's a debate, factually or legally,
about whether this is the stream -- if it's not in the
export stream. If it's not in the export stream, it's
not an export or a violation. If there is a factual
debate, it wouldn't fall within the Enochs versus
Williams Packing exception. There was no factual
debate. There is a stipulated judgment in this case.
What Enochs tells us, again, is that the
government can't have a tax be a tax solely for the
purpose of curtailing constitutional recovery. That's
the only way that this was a legitimate tax in their
view, not to collect revenue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If 7422(a) had said
any -- any Internal Revenue tax, including a tax imposed
in alleged violation of the Export Clause, that would
cut -- cut out the six-year statute of limitations,
right? If it said the refund procedure applies to any
Internal Revenue tax including one imposed in alleged
violation of the Export Clause?
MS. MILLETT: I think it would clear up an
awful lot. If I could just clarify, though. What this
court held in Enochs versus William Packing is that the
phrase "any tax" only applies if the government is at
least willing to assert a plausible defense for the tax.
And so it would depend on whether any tax would still
include that limitation in your scenario, if they are
willing to assert a plausible Export Clause.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Nothing different from
what it is now, but just Congress makes clear that a tax
and alleged violation of the Export Clause falls within
the term "any Internal Revenue tax"?
MS. MILLETT: Then I think my position would
be that it does not, because this Court has held for
half a century without Congress changing it that any tax
means a tax that the government asserts is valid. It
doesn't have to be correct. It has to assert that it's
valid. Otherwise it's in the guise of a tax and it
doesn't fall --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not certain it was
valid if this coal was not shipped overseas. You're
putting an awful burden on the government to know when
the coal is severed and shipped. You're saying if they
mistake a shipment as being only for domestic use rather
than for shipment abroad, they don't have any basis
whatever for the tax claim. I'm not sure I agree with.
MS. MILLETT: The problem in this case,
Justice Scalia, is that there were two statutes. There
was a statute imposing the coal tax, 26 U.S.C. 4121 --
this is all on the first page of our brief -- and then
there was an amendment to the exemption for exports in
U.S.C. 4221 that specifically said the general tax
exemption for exports does not apply to this coal tax,
and that provision captured nothing but exports of coal.
JUSTICE BREYER: Your point is that you
don't have to go through the refund requirements of 7422
if the government was -- although it did ask for the
money as a tax, they are really out to lunch? I mean,
the trouble -- is there any authority for an argument
like that? I mean, the trouble I guess that I would
have that argument is, one is linguistic, because it
goes on to say "or of any sum alleged to have been
excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected."
And then the other thing is just common
sense: Suppose you have an insane tax collector. You
know, I mean, that could happen. And the insane tax
collector they discover some years later has been
assessing all these penalties for no reason and people
have been paying some of them because, terrible tragedy,
terrible thing. But I guess they'd be stuck, I'd always
thought, with the three-year statute of limitations, so
even those it's really nuts.
Now, is there -- is there any authority for
us making a distinction between an insane -- to get an
extreme, an insane assessment of a tax and just a
wrongful assessment of a tax?
MS. MILLETT: The authority is this Court's
unanimous opinion in Enochs versus Williams --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MS. MILLETT: -- which said that if -- we
are dealing with the same language -- no suit shall be
maintained for any tax in any court. And it said in
that, that statutory language, "any tax" means something
that the government can plausibly defend as a tax.
JUSTICE BREYER: What about the "any sum,"
"in any manner"? You know, what about that language?
MS. MILLETT: Again, the key language --
JUSTICE BREYER: "Any sum in any manner
wrongfully collected."
MS. MILLETT: Right. This Court dealt with
that, I think it's in -- I think in Dalm, and sometimes
it has its own rules in the taxing, but this is -- the
question is any tax, and any tax doesn't mean something
that's just in the guise of tax, whether the guy is
insane or Congress just forgot to read the Export
Clause. But as soon as we look, everyone knows this is
unconstitutional, then understand what the impact of
that is. That means the only way this is a legitimate
tax under the government's rule, the only legitimate tax
function that this serves is to cut off constitutional
remedies. That's its only role.
JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. Their argument
is, I'm terribly sorry, that if the way you're hurt is
you paid a tax you shouldn't pay and you want to get a
refund, go through the administrative procedure.
MS. MILLETT: This Court said in Enochs that
you don't -- that tax -- the whole point of the Tax
Exemption Act is to funnel everybody in for tax refund
procedure. And this court said you don't have to go if
it is not a tax. And what they mean by not a tax, is
that it can't plausibly be defended by the government as
a tax. This doesn't happen often. This is an
extraordinary exception. But this is the case where it
did. And if the government --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why do you -- I
take it, though, that you concede the six-year statute
of limitations under the Tucker Act, right? I mean,
your brief says this is an unbending and unqualified
prohibition on the use of exports except up to -- if
it's before six years and one day. You are taking an
adamant position with respect to three years but you
give up six years.
MS. MILLETT: No. It's unbending and wrong
whether it's within six years or ten years. But we
agree that a constitutional right can have a statute of
limitation -- if there is a constitutional right that
doesn't have any statute of limitations, I don't know
what it is and it's not this one. The question is --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why aren't three years
enough?
MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why aren't three years
enough?
MS. MILLETT: Because it's a question of
statutory construction. And Congress determined what
the right statute of limitation is for a constitutional
claim, and that's six years. If Congress had a
three-year statute of limitations under the Tucker Act
for all constitutional claims, we wouldn't be here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so, the
rhetoric in your brief how this is a constitutionally
based prohibition is not pertinent? You're saying if
the statute was clear and it said three years, that
would be fine, even though it's a claim under the Export
Clause?
MS. MILLETT: We don't -- to the Export
Clause, right, distinguishes between three years and six
years in its own right. What the Export Clause does,
though, there is the statutory construction argument and
we have the Enochs argument, but we also think there are
substantial constitutional concerns here. And the
Export Clause makes it most imperative for this Court to
continue to adhere to its definition of any tax, and
that's because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is the Export Clause
so, so significant? The only other self-executing
constitutional clause that provides for damages
automatically that comes to mind is the Takings Clause.
And we have allowed the states to require claimants to
jump through innumerable hoops. They have to exhaust
all their administrative remedies before they can bring
a suit here. Why -- why is the Export Clause any -- any
more sacrosanct?
MS. MILLETT: Because we don't -- under the
Constitution the government hasn't done anything wrong
unless -- until -- unless and until it actually effects
a taking and doesn't pay for it through process.  Those
processes are how we determine -- get to the point where
there has been an actual constitutional violation here.
No administrative process is necessary to
have -- to know that tax has been posed on exports. And
what's distinct about the Export Clause, to get back to
Chief Justice Roberts' question, is that it is -- this
Court said unanimously in U.S. Shoe, a simple, direct,
unqualified prohibition on congressional tax power in
terms, and it disallows any effort to raise revenue
through the Tax Power Act.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Volenti non fit injuria.
If indeed the taxpayer pays out the money for an
unconstitutional export tax, it seems to me that person
has no claim until he complies with the administrative
procedures that render that tax unconstitutional. But
up until the point where he is paying it voluntarily, it
seems to me there is no constitutional violation.
MS. MILLETT: Congress eliminated in the
early 1920s any prepayment protest requirement under the
tax law. And the tax law -- the Internal Revenue Code
applies sweepingly to Americans across this country,
vast majority of whom are not equipped with tax lawyers
at their side to make protests at the moment they pay
their taxes. That's never been required.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not saying it has to be
made at the moment they pay their taxes. I'm just
saying until it's made there is no unconstitutional,
unconstitutional export tax.
MS. MILLETT: That's right. Until the tax
-- well, it would be an unconstitutional statute on the
books. No one has been injured by it or affected by it
until somebody actually pays it or is required by the
government to pay it. I don't dispute that, but keep in
mind we're dealing with a tax refund scheme. The tax
refund scheme is an extraordinary creature in the law
for many good reasons but that -- that reverses the
order of everything. It makes you pay before any
entitlement has been shown to that money by the
government.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you didn't have
to pay --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Here there was a payment.
Here there was a payment.
MS. MILLETT: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's different than if you
try to enjoin the collection at the outset.
MS. MILLETT: It's only --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that argument doesn't
work.
MS. MILLETT: It's only different in the
sense that government's interests are less, and the
government's interests are most acute in having people
pointed to the tax-refund scheme, this Court has said
time and again, before -- to pay first and fight later.
And as a result -- I mean, if it's most acute --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about the
deficiency procedure? And I don't know if that applies
with excise taxes, but suppose they didn't pay this tax
and they get a notice of deficiency. Where would they
MS. MILLETT: There -- there's nowhere for
them to go for this particular tax. You can't go to tax
court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not?
MS. MILLETT: Because tax court doesn't
apply to excise taxes for the most part. There may be a
few exceptions. It essentially applies to income gift
and estate taxes, and it certainly didn't apply to this
provision here. They could have -- they could have
gotten the assessment and gotten on the phone with an
IRS. Otherwise they'd have to wait for a lien or levy.
Now, the government, by the way, has --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if we -- if we
accept your view in this case, they can go in a district
court and enjoin them. It's not a tax. The Tax
Injunction Act doesn't apply.
MS. MILLETT: The -- the
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- which is just what
Justice Ginsburg's questions point out. And earlier I
had indicated that in this case they did pay the tax.
MS. MILLETT: I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me there is
a distinction. It may be that you would prevail in your
argument.
MS. MILLETT: I know. We couldn't have --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If they tried -- if they
tried -- do you think they could enjoin the collection
of a tax refund?
MS. MILLETT: No, they couldn't because in
addition to showing the government's imposition of the
tax is legally indefensible, you still have to show
entitlement to an injunction, and unless you can
establish irreparable harm just by paying money, which
I'm not aware of any coal company that could have, you
could have gotten an injunction. And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, I mean, in your
argument you say it is absolutely -- that it doesn't
apply. Just get an injunction.
MS. MILLETT: You can't get an injunction
just because something is unlawful. That's never been
allowed under equity. You also have to show irreparable
harm.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then we'll invent
the hypothetical company that is going to go broke and
all that stuff.
MS. MILLETT: But I mean, it's not a
question of inventing. This Court dealt with exactly
that question in Enochs, where -- Enochs versus Williams
Packing, and later again in South Carolina versus Regan,
and Commissioner versus Shapiro -- that you can't just
come in and say it's unlawful, that you actually have to
then establish irreparable harm. Everything in the tax
scheme points to taxpayers with enormous penalties and
enormous risks to pay first, fight later. And when a
taxpayer does that, it's also --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you can't have it both
ways. You're saying it isn't a tax for your purposes,
and then in my hypothetical case you say you have to go
through the tax law.
MS. MILLETT: It's the government that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the same with your
answer, what I thought was your answer to Justice
Ginsburg's question.
MS. MILLETT: It's the government that wants
to have it both ways. It wants to say it is a tax just
for purposes of making it a nonconstitutional case under
the Tucker Act and to make it the tax scheme, but in no
way is this defensible as a tax.
JUSTICE BREYER: In looking at your
argument, I see it now, I think, if I'm right. You're
-- that it would have very broad reach. It would reach
-- it doesn't just concern the constitutional claim; it
concerns any claim you'd have against the IRS. And
there's authority that says if the IRS' position is too
far out, you can go get an injunction. That's what
you're pointing to. And then you're argument is,
because of that authority, that kind of an exception for
the far out IRS claim also applies to the statute of
limitation and administrative requirement. And your
problem is the latter has never been held. And the
reason that that's a problem, I take it, is because when
you're talking about injunctions, you're talking about
basic equity, but when you're talking about later on
administrative requirements, there's really no reason
they couldn't have filed the claim. And if we were to
accept an argument on the -- to the contrary and
analogize it, it's going to cut through rules,
regulations, statutes, constitutional claims,
everything, really making a hash of their provision
there -- of the administrative provision. So, what is
your response to that thought which --
MS. MILLETT: I have two responses: One,
it's going to have far less effect on this situation, in
the post-payment situation, than it did in Enochs, where
it wasn't limited to the Export Clause. This situation
is only going to work where you not only establish the
government has no basis for this tax, a hard thing to
do, but that you have a money-mandating constitutional
provision. There aren't many of them. If you don't
have a money-mandating position, you've got nowhere else
to go but the tax scheme.
So it's extremely limited, but I want to get
back -- this is not about an equity rule. This Court
was specific in Enochs versus Williams Packing, when it
said, our prior decision under Miller versus Standard
Nut, in which you had done a more generous view of this
get around the Tax Injunction Act, was wrong, because
the Tax Injunction Act is not an equitable rule. Enochs
was a statutory construction rule. Pages 6, 7, and 8 of
that decision make it plain in terms -- you talk about
what the act requires, and the language of this Court is
construing is the phrase "any tax." And if it has no
legitimate basis, then it's in the guise of a tax.
That same language has been on the books for
almost half a century. Congress went back from the Tax
Injunction Act eight times without changing it in
response to this Court's decisions. Enochs has been
reaffirmed by this Court five times. Congress enacted
an entirely new Internal Revenue Code in 1986 that used
that "any tax" language in 7422, with this Court's five
decisions on the book and kept that language. And it
makes sense. Congress doesn't -- doesn't enact a tax
where it's only tax function --
JUSTICE BREYER: What do you want to do
about your argument, as I hear it, has nothing to do
with the nature of the claim that you're asserting to
get the money back. It has to do with the nature of the
IRS's defense and -- well, can you do it that way? Can
you say the word "any tax" or "any claim" -- I can't
remember that other. What was it? It was any -- "any
sum" -- "any sum" or "any tax." Can you say, well, it
means one thing if they are saying that the reason they
want it back is that it violates the Constitution, and
those words mean a different thing if the reason that
you want it back is it violates an IRS reg; it violates
an IRS statute.
MS. MILLETT: I'm not saying that "any tax"
means anything different. I'm just pointing out that if
you succeed --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it doesn't mean
anything different and then if the very far-out claim to
a tax is so far out it isn't a tax, that would be true
in the regulation context, in the statutory context as
well as the constitutional context. Am I missing
something?
MS. MILLETT: No, because you have to have a
money-mandating claim under the Constitution to fall
within the Tucker Act. The -- this Court said, the
Tucker Act for purposes of the statutory claims under
the Internal Revenue Code, as this court said in
Kreider, takes three years to the statute of
limitations. So I don't think, after Kreider, that you
would still have a six-year statute of limitations under
the Tucker Act for a statutory tax claim.
The difference is constitutional
enforcement, and this is fundamentally a constitutional
right that's being enforced. And the question is, would
Congress had thought -- this is all a question of
statutory construction -- would Congress have thought
this is more a constitutional claim or a tax claim? And
they've made the sensible decision, at least as this
Court construed it in Enochs, in South Carolina versus
Regan -- addressed it in Janis and Bob Jones University
and the Americans United case, all of which are in our
brief --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're saying it's
both. You're not saying it's "either/or" because for
three years you did use the refund procedure. So you
used the refund procedure for the years that were within
the three-year period, and then for the years that were
outside the three-year period, you have this other
theory. So you're not saying this is not for refund.
That route is closed. The only route is this
constitutional -- this claim directly under the Export
Clause. But your own conduct seems to have been it's
our option. We can treat it as a refund claim or we can
treat it as a constitutional claim.
MS. MILLETT: One can get -- there is
nothing in the tax administrative scheme where one when
shows up to file a tax refund where you say if I go by
this route, I'm waiving all others. It's not like I'm
agreeing to go go through arbitration and forgoing my
rights to go through a court procedure. Congress has --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In other words, what were
you just telling us is that this is not a refund claim;
this is a constitutional claim. But you are now saying,
I think, that it's both; it's whatever the taxpayer or
the plaintiff wants it to be.
MS. MILLETT: It's a constitutional claim to
get your tax money back. That's right. And the
administrative scheme is fully amenable to that. That's
certainly the government's position, and we don't
disagree. The question is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Plus you get
interest.
MS. MILLETT: Yes. Absolutely. We could
get it on both grounds, but you get --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're saying you get
interest too in either way. You're saying -- I thought
you said for the three years that are within the
three-year refund limit, you get interest and then
you're also saying, going back six years, you also get
interest. You're not saying that if you -- if you're
outside the refund procedure you don't get interest.
MS. MILLETT: Right. But that's because
we're -- I mean, there's a -- there's a separate
interest provision in the tax code for the
administrative refund procedure. They don't really an
U.S.C. 2411. I think it's 26 U.S.C. 6511. But
there's a specific administrative brief on tax -- I'm
sorry, interest provision for the administrative refund
scheme. And so, under that, when you're in the
administrative scheme, you get what the administrative
scheme's interest provision gives you. We don't dispute
that.
And then the question is, once you've gone
to court, the relevant interest provision is the one in
U.S.C., not in the tax code, by the way, but in 28
U.S.C., providing them -- providing for interest when
you've recovered an overpayment of taxes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the interest the same
in amount in either case?
MS. MILLETT: Yes, because in 2411 it
cross-references the -- well, let me clarify. There is
one potential wrinkle, but generally speaking 2411 if
you look at it, and it's at the end of the
cross-references --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: 2411 -- 2411 is what you
use in the court when you have a straight tax refund
claim. It's not as though 2411 is there for some other
claim. It's what you get when you go to court and
you're suing for a refund. That's 2411. That's
applicable if you get a judgment for an overpayment in
respect of any Internal Revenue tax. That's what --
it's in Title 28, but that's what it's for. It's for an
overpayment in respect of any Internal Revenue tax.
MS. MILLETT: This is all on page 4a of the
Government's brief if you want to see where it
cross-references the Internal Revenue interest
provisions.
No, there's nothing there that says you have
to have gone through the administrative scheme. All you
have to have is an overpayment. If you have an
overpayment, under Bonwit Teller --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- the use of any
Internal Revenue tax, and your whole argument is this
isn't an Internal Revenue tax. So it's clearly not an
Internal Revenue tax that you have a constitutional
claim directly under the Constitution, so how does it
become for purposes of 2411 an Internal Revenue tax?
MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry, I misunderstood
your question, Justice Ginsburg. But I want to make
clear that you don't have to go through the refund
scheme to get this. This interest would apply in Bonwit
Teller for accounts stated, in the Rosenman case for
deposit on taxes. That's how we read it.
Your second point, yes, that if we say this
is not a plausible tax under Enochs versus Williams,
that I think, and if this Court agrees, that this is not
a tax under Enochs versus Williams, so that we're not
bound by 7422, then I agree that our interest argument
becomes harder at that point textually.
I will tell you that I still think the fact
that they say "in respect of any Internal Revenue tax"
gives us room to say that where the government has at
least treated it and collected the money as though it
were an Internal Revenue tax, that might be a way to get
interest. If this Court agrees, though, that it's
not --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't agree in
your basic claim that if the government is treating it
as an Internal Revenue tax, which it certainly didn't,
you'd say that works only for the interest, not --
MS. MILLETT: Only -- I'm sorry. Only
because we have the "in respect of language." That's
the only -- but if this Court disagrees with that, and
we recognize it's harder if this Court agreed, we have a
separate constitutional argument that the Export Clause,
just like the Just Compensation Clause requires interest
paid in its own right. And so that's the alternative
basis.
And this Court, of course, can affirm the
judgment on any basis supported by the record.
But I want to get back. Very clearly that
there is, the bottom -- I mean, Justice Scalia, you
talked about, you know, which pot you want to put this
in. The rarity of this case and what's unique about it
is that the government came in agreeing up front,
stipulated judgment, no fact dispute, no law disputes,
this is in the pot of no legitimate status of the tax.
No claim whatsoever. The government couldn't think of
anything.
But for purposes of limiting your
constitutional relief, then it's in the pot of a
legitimate. Tax and we think they can't have it both,
ways and particularly as a matter of statutory
construction. This is ultimately a question of which
scheme is better fitted to vindicating the Constitution.
And Congress said any tax, just like it said in the Tax
Injunction Act. This court has said what any tax means.
It said it five times after Enochs. And Congress has
not reacted to it.
Stare decisis applies most powerfully in the
statutory construction Congress -- context, and if
Congress thought there were a problem with what -- with
how this Court defined any tax, it would have said so.
It could have done so. It's had half a century to do
something.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You give all of this
up when it comes to the statute of limitations. I mean,
the government's argument could be just as implausible
as you suggested it is here. But if it involves a claim
six years and one day out, it's just too bad. It
doesn't matter that it's a constitutional claim. It
doesn't matter how erroneous the government's position
was, because the government can impose limitations like
that even on the assertion of constitutional claims.
That's all they are doing here.
MS. MILLETT: But the Tucker Act doesn't use
the "word any tax" in defining the statute of
limitations. It's a statute of limitations for
constitutional claims.
Our argument is what the word "any tax"
means in 7422 and does it force us to go through the tax
refund scheme. Our argument is, as this Court said
unanimously in Enochs -- the decision has never been
questioned by any justice of this court -- that any tax
does not apply if it had no tax status for any other
purpose. It can't be just to limit --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We say just as
unanimously a couple of things last year on -- term as
well in Jencks and certainly the Federal circuit's
decision wouldn't have come out the same if they had had
Hinck's term of trust on the books.
MS. MILLETT: I'm not sure -- I'm not sure
it would have come out differently. Maybe they would
have explained things differently. But this Court said
in most cases the question is which statutory scheme is
better fitted. And at two levels we think the Tucker
Act is better fitted for this claim.
One, because any tax only applies when there
is asserted legitimate basis for the tax; and two, the
Export Clause is a unique limitation, specifically
denies the government any authority to use exports as a
source of revenue. And you have a refund scheme here
that has been designed over the years specifically to
protect revenue interest, to make you pay the revenue
first and have them hold it.
It's not just holding them for six months.
They had to pay every two weeks. But, of course, the
government didn't treat that as paid for purposes of
interest until the end of the quarter when a return was
filed. That's one way why the interest calculation
might be different under the Tucker Act than it would be
under the refund scheme, just the timing of whether it's
the deposit or the actual return.
Justice Kennedy, I forgot to get back to you
on that.
But the question here is whether the Export
Clause can be fully enforced by -- which it's -- it's
not a suggestion and it doesn't say when you're doing
your tax stuff, it's okay if you slop on on exports a
little bit. Exports are completely off limits to the
tax power. And Congress using its tax power to create a
tax scheme that specifically preserves and protects
revenue and is not a revenue neutral system is not the
best scheme for vindicating the Export Clause. It's not
better for that. It is at cross purposes with the
Export Clause.
But the bottom is this Court doesn't need to
get to that constitutional question. We think it
certainly informs the analysis. It certainly is enough
of a constitutional concern or doubt to conclude that
Enochs still applies any tax in the tax injunction --
any tax in any court. No suit shall be maintained for
any tax in any court means the same thing in 7422 that
it means in the Tax Injunction Act. If Congress thought
it meant something different, it has had half -- almost
half a century to tell us.
It hasn't done that, and the Export Clause
can't serve its unique historical function of keeping
government's tax regulatory hands off -- hands off the
tax export process and the revenue out of the Federal
Fiske unless this is treated as a constitutional claim.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Ms. Millett. Mr. Jay, you have 15 minutes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jay, I hope in the 15
minutes, you will state what the government's position
is on this Enochs case that's been mentioned at least a
dozen times.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JAY: I'll be glad to, Your Honor.
Enochs case construed not Section 7422, but Section
21, the Injunction Act provision of the tax code. And
the question in Enochs was whether the taxpayer simply
by alleging that the tax was so -- so invalidly applied
that it was only in the guise of the tax could avoid
paying the tax and bring an injunctive claim.
The court in Enochs held that it could not
because the taxpayer had not, in fact, satisfied the
basic requirement of all claims for injunctive relief as
irreparable injury. And the court also held that
whether a tax is defensible for purposes of this very
narrow exception is to be determined on the basis of the
information to the government at the time of suit. So
in this --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait what very narrow
exception? It didn't apply the exception.
MR. JAY: As the Court was preserving, I
think, in Dick, though, because -- because the Court
ultimately denied the exception in that case and in each
case since, preserving the holding in Standard Nut and
Margarine, a case from the 1920's. Justice Breyer
alluded to this when he asked my friend, Ms. Millett,
about whether this exception is geared primarily to
factual issues or to legal issues. In Standard Nut and
Margarine the government had decided to attempt to
impose a tax meant for oleomargarine on a product made
entirely from nuts. And this Court, you know, without
construing the tax-injunctive provision, simply
referring to principles of equity, this Court held that
the government's theory of assessing the tax was simply
in the guise of a tax and it permitted the injunctive
claim to proceed.
In Williams Packing the government's -- the
government had a collateral basis for assessing the tax,
and so the taxpayer was remitted to the same remedy that
any taxpayer who wants to challenge a tax as having been
unlawfully assessed or collected is subject to; that is,
to pay the tax, file a refund claim, and if the refund
claim is upheld either by the IRS or subsequently in
court, to receive a full refund with interest.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't the two go together?
If you could bring an injunction action, surely you
don't have to pay the tax.
MR. JAY: Well, if you can satisfy the
requirements for injunctive relief -- and Williams
Packing, the taxpayer, couldn't; and in the cases since
the taxpayer couldn't -- then the court can enjoin the
collection of the taxes applied to you.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what she is
saying. She is saying that those conditions exist here.
That this is not -- not a plausible tax; and, therefore,
she could have gotten an injunction; and, therefore, by
a parity of reasoning, she doesn't have to go through
the tax provisions.
MR. JAY: I think I have three responses to
that.
One is that we don't think that a -- an
exception to the -- to 7421 should carry over into
Section 7422. But even in the circumstances of this
case, this is a facially constitutional tax. The tax is
imposed on coal mined in the United States. And if no
-- if none of the coal that is subject to the tax is
ever in the stream of export when the tax is imposed,
then the tax is perfectly constitutional. And that is
why Section 4121 remains on the books today.
The tax is unconstitutional only in certain
narrow circumstances when the coal actually is is in the
stream of export. As I explained --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you could say the
same about the tax on oleomargarine. It is a perfectly
valid tax but not when you impose it on nuts. And here
the tax on coal is a perfectly valid tax, but not when
you impose it on coal that's in the stream of export.
MR. JAY: But if one of these coal companies
had sought to enjoin the tax, the government would have
pointed to the provision in Williams Packing that says
that whether the tax is defensible is to be determined
on the basis of the information available to the
government at the time of suit until the taxpayer
demonstrates that the coal is actually in the stream of
export, which is precisely what's done during the refund
process that the taxpayers used in this case to show
that their coal was in the stream of export when they
obtained the refund. That's what -- that's how they
obtained a full -- full relief.
But, in any event, the history of this
litigation shows that this is not -- this is not a claim
about the facial unconstitutionality of the tax because
the tax continued to be collected without protest in the
case of the Respondents here for 21 consecutive years.
And by the time they filed for a refund this
Court had decided IBM. It had decided U.S. shoe. The
district court had decided Ranger Fuel, and the
government had announced that it would not appeal the
decision in Ranger Fuel striking down the coal tax.
But that doesn't mean that for that -- for
that entire time the government had no basis on which to
defend the tax. I mean the government had colorful
arguments to defend the tax at issue in U.S. Shoe in
June 1996. Shoe was in 1996. And it had colorful
arguments to defend the harbor maintenance tax in U.S.
Shoe. I may have misspoke. IBM in 1996, and U.S. Shoe
in 1998.
So to say that during the period at issue in
this case, 1994 through 1996, the tax was so facially
invalid that the narrow Williams Packing exception to
another statutory provision justifies Respondents'
attempt to circumvent the tax refund statute, we just
think is not correct.
In the case of a taxpayer who -- who can
satisfy the exception, you know, the Tax Code does,
indeed, put that taxpayer to the choice. It gives them
a fully effective post- payment refund remedy where they
can avoid any penalties and interest by paying the tax
and litigating for a full refund.
JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Is the government's
view that the money that they are seeking here, if you
look at 7422, that it falls within the language of any
Internal Revenue tax alleged to be erroneously or
illegally assessed or the language "any sum alleged to
have been in any manner wrongfully collected," or both?
MR. JAY: I don't think that we need to go
beyond the first clause, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: So when I decide this case,
I should forget the words "any sum"?
MR. JAY: I mean the Court construed a
similar provision in Flora versus United States in 1960,
which explained that "any sum" is a cumulative
provision. So that if something is within the scope of
an Internal Revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously
or illegally collected or assessed, that's as far as you
need to go.
JUSTICE BREYER: But it means that if, in
fact, it is not within the scope of the word "tax," then
it is not within "any sum"?
MR. JAY: No. To the contrary, Your Honor.
I think that the holding in Flora is that if it's not
within the scope of the first provision, then you would
need to look at the second -- actually the third
provision, the "any sum" language.
JUSTICE BREYER: In Enochs -- she is quite
right, your opposing lawyer -- it says the exaction is
merely in the guise of a tax. And when it says it is
within the guise of a tax, then it doesn't fall within
the Tax Injunction Act.
And there it says if it is clear that under
no circumstances could the government ultimately
prevail, the central purpose of the Tax Injunction Act
is inapplicable. And then it's just in the guise of a
tax. And that, she says, is the test we should apply
here. So that's where I think Justice Ginsburg began.
What is your specific response to that?
MR. JAY: Well, my specific response, Your
Honor, first is that in this case the tax simply was not
in the guise of a tax. But even if, you know, today, if
the taxpayer were -- if a taxpayer were alleging that
the coal tax were in the guise of a tax and that it,
therefore, could bring a prepayment -- a prepayment
action, it does not then follow that the taxpayer could
still after the fact, if it opted not to bring that
prepayment action, the taxpayer could then escape the
three-year, nontollable, unusually emphatic limitation
period that applies to a claim for a postpayment remedy,
which is the exclusive means of obtaining a postpayment
remedy.
And, you know, the courts recognized time
and again that taxing authorities have a strong interest
in fiscal stability, and it effectively closes the books
on a particular tax year. So that taxpayers, after the
tax is paid, if they want to protest the tax, they have
three years in which to put the government on notice.
That, you know, even if the claim is this tax is so
beyond the pale that it can't be defended, they have to
put the government on notice of that claim.
And if they do, then the IRS considers it;
and if the IRS turns them down, then they can proceed to
district court or to the Court of Federal Claims.
In addition, I think I just wanted to
clarify one point about the availability of prepayment
remedies in this case. I think, Justice Ginsburg, my
friend, Miss Millett, was correct about the fact that
this excise tax does not -- is not susceptible to the
deficiency proceeding in tax court.
And we have cited in footnote 7 of our reply
brief at page 16 the possibility that there may be
another route if the taxpayer feels strongly about the
unconstitutionality of the tax and is willing to take
the chance that if the taxpayer's position is rejected,
that the taxpayer may be liable for penalties and
interest for not paying the tax.
I mean, of course, the general rule is that
the taxpayer is expected to pay the tax and proceed
postpayment by putting the IRS on notice of the claim.
But Congress, in Section 6330(c)(2)(B) of Title 26, has
provided some limited ability, if a taxpayer has not
previously been able to litigate the merits of the tax,
the taxpayer has a limited opportunity to do so first
before the IRS, then in Tax Court, and then before the
Court of Appeals.
And, again, on Miss Millett's supposition
that this is a completely, clearly unconstitutional tax,
then the taxpayer would have the option of doing that.
Again, the refund scheme is set up so that if the
taxpayer doesn't want to take the chance that its
argument will not be accepted, the taxpayer has a
simple, open remedy: To file a refund claim at any
point within three years.
That's exactly what Respondents did not do
for the 21 consecutive years that they paid this tax
without complaint.
If the Court has no further questions?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted. We'll hear the third case
beginning this afternoon.
(Whereupon, at 11:38 a.m., the case in the
