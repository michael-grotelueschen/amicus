CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this term in Altria Group v. Stephanie Good.
Mr. Olson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Respondents' state law claims track nearly
verbatim the Cigarette Labeling Act's pre-emption
provision. For example, the complaint challenges
promotions of light cigarettes as less harmful and safer
to smokers than regular cigarettes. But the statute,
Congress, explicitly preempted any requirement
respecting the promotion of cigarettes based upon
smoking and health. In short, the Respondents are
seeking in state court precisely what Congress
pre-empted. There is no space --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, what if
the state law claim did not require any inquiry into the
relationship between smoking and health? Something
along the lines of saying our studies show that light
cigarettes are healthier for you, and in fact their
studies show the opposite. So all you, all the
plaintiff would have to show is that there was a
deception, a disconnect between the studies and the ad.
It wouldn't matter whether light cigarettes were
healthier or not healthier. Is that the type of action
that could be brought?
MR. OLSON: Well, I think the facts could
differ from case to case, Mr. Chief Justice. But the
inquiry is going to be generally, I think, simple: Is
there a requirement? Is it based upon smoking and
health, and does it appear in an advertising or
promotion of a cigarette. Now, I suppose there might be
conceivably circumstances where it's impossible to tell
that the requirement is not connected in some way with
smoking and health, but it's certainly clear here.
The complaint specifically talks in terms of
promoting cigarettes, purporting to be less harmful or
safer, despite serious health problems associated with
smoking. These appear at the beginning in paragraph 2
of the amended complaint which is at pages, beginning
Joint Appendix pages 26 through 28. I invite the
Court's attention to paragraph 2 of the amended
complaint and paragraphs 15 and 18 of the amended
complaint. In fact, the words "promotion,"
"cigarettes," "smoking," "safety," and "health," the
very words that appear in the Labeling Act statute,
appear, I counted at least 12 times in the amended
complaint.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it a question of just
how you phrase it, Mr. Olson? Is there any scope --
does your argument leave any scope for attorney general,
state attorney general imposition of state law remedies
against a deceptive practice involving advertising
cigarettes. To give you concrete examples, suppose a
state attorney general said in every - suppose the
practice were in every carton of cigarettes the
cigarette manufacturer includes an insert that says: If
you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes; if
you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes.
And the state attorney general goes after that statement
in the carton as false and deceptive advertising. Would
there be any scope for that?
MR. OLSON: I think that there is. In
answer to the general question that you ask, Justice
Gins burg, there is plenty of room for an attorney
general to pursue deceptive advertising. Another
example -- and I'll come to the one you mentioned -- is
that someone might misrepresent the number of cigarettes
in a package or other things having to do with
cigarettes. That would not necessarily be related to
smoking and health. So there is not a pre-emption if
there is not a relationship between the prohibition and
smoking and health. The example you gave might require
some sort of inquiry as to what is motivating the
attorney general. The motivation is what you referred
to, your Court referred to in the Reilly case and I
would say --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Olson, doesn't your
answer in effect, in practical terms, exclude the
possibility of inserts like that? I mean, what else
would they be addressing except smoking and health?
That's the only subject on the table.
MR. OLSON: I think that's probably true in
most cases, Justice Souter, that the reason why there
might be regulations at the State level having to do
with cigarettes and advertising by and large is going to
have to do with smoking and health. The Court went
through the same inquiry in the Reilly case where it had
to do with billboards and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your answer then to my
specific example would be the attorney general could not
go after such a statement, "If you want to ingest less
nicotine, buy our cigarettes"?
MR. OLSON: If -- if the courts were to
conclude that it had a relationship with smoking and
health, the answer is yes, Justice Ginsburg, but there
might be some case in which someone said, well, the
issue about nicotine and content of nicotine is being
regulated because it doesn't have anything to do with
smoking and health, but in the environment in which this
-- this statute was passed and this litigation was
pursued, there certainly isn't any question here. Now,
I think Justice Stevens, even in his dissenting opinion
in the Reilly case, focused on the content. He said and
the -- your dissenting opinion in that case said, as
opposed to location, that the Labeling Act was focusing
on the content of advertising.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose that a new
drug is found for the treatment of a condition, glaucoma
-- hypothetical -- and the evidence is stunningly clear
that smoking with this new drug causes a severe allergic
reaction. Does the cigarette manufacturer have any duty
to disclose this on the label or in promotions?
MR. OLSON: No, Justice Kennedy, to the --
the Federal Trade Commission, by the way, has full
authority to regulate deceptive --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I -- they've just
found this out last week. Do they have any -- there can
be no -- I take it under your position there can be no
suit based on misleading or false promotion or labeling,
and there can be no suit even for the sale of an unsafe
item?
MR. OLSON: Well, there could be -- the
States may regulate the sale of items. The Labeling Act
provision only relates to promotion, marketing,
advertising, and that sort of thing. The State can
prohibit the sale of cigarettes. States and
municipalities have done that sort of thing. This
statute has three provisions in it: Is what the State
is attempting to do a requirement or prohibition.
There's no question that that's involved here. Does it
have to do with the advertising or promotion of
cigarettes? There's no question that this complaint is
aimed at the advertising and promotion of cigarettes.
And does the advertising or promotion have to do with
smoking and health?
JUSTICE BREYER: So, in your view, it says
in Cipollone that this -- that the four people said in
Cipollone that this statute does not pre-empt State law
where it's based on a prohibition of making a false
statement of material fact. For example, to make a
funny example, somebody could advertise smoking 42
cigarettes a day will grow back your hair.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: That's totally false, and
in your view, that would be pre-empted, if Congress
attempted to pre-empt a state law that says you cannot
make a completely false statement of material fact --
MR. OLSON: I don't --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- if it's based on -- has
something to do with smoking and health.
MR. OLSON: I don't mean to be whimsical,
but I think that, to the extent there's a representation
with respect to growing hair or something like that,
that may not -- it probably isn't -- have to do with
smoking and health.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I was trying to
produce an -- I mean, it will build strong bodies eight
ways.
(Laughter.)
MR. OLSON: Yes. And let me say with
respect to the Cipollone plurality opinion, which was
found to be baffling, confusing, litigation- generating,
easily abated by the labeling of the complaint, and
superseded by a number of subsequent decisions by this
Court, it should be set aside and restated. However,
the very case that the Cipollone decision in the
plurality did decide was pre-empted even under that
plurality opinion, and this is at page 527 of the
opinion, is an advertising that purported to neutralize,
minimize, down-play, negate, or disclaim the warning
label on the packages. This complaint is precisely that
claim. You could probably not have written a claim more
squarely --
JUSTICE BREYER: Excuse me. The reason I
think the plurality wrote this, I'm guessing, is that
when you read through this statute it seems as if what
Congress had in mind in the statute was not setting
aside State law, which is tradition, about not making
false statements, false and deceptive advertising law.
It was concerned with a different thing. They said, to
the cigarette companies: You have to put on the label
"Smoking is dangerous to your health." We don't want
States telling you to put other things like that on the
label, and we don't want States forbidding you to put a
picture of the Marlboro man or Lauren Bacall with her
cigarette. We don't want States to tell you that you
can't do that. That would be focused on the object of
the statute, which no one said had as its objective
setting aside traditional unfair and deceptive
advertising law. I think that's the argument.
MR. OLSON: That is the argument, and the
Respondents are making that argument. I submit that
that argument is squarely answered by the text of the
statute, which this Court has said again and again you
have to turn to. The text of the statute says no
requirement or prohibition; it doesn't say no
requirement or prohibition except one which is expressly
misleading. And the reason you mentioned, Justice
Breyer, what was the background for the statute or what
was Congress intending to do, well, fortunately on
section 1331 of the Labeling Act, which is on 1A of the
blue brief, Congress declares its policy and purpose
squarely, unequivocally, and in what this Court said in
Reilly was sweeping language: Any relationship between
smoking and health. And then Congress went on to point
out that with the labeling requirements, it intended for
consumers to receive certain information about the
smoking of cigarettes with specific labels, and then
went on to say, without hurting the commerce and the
national economy to be protected from confusing
cigarette labeling and advertising regulations that
might be "non-uniform, confusing, or diverse."
Now, Justice Stevens again in the Reilly
opinion when he was distinguishing in his concurring
opinion -- I can't recall whether it's a concurring or
dissenting opinion -- focused on the fact that different
requirements by different States might cause those very
diverse, confusing advertising. If one State says,
you've got to put something else in there about this;
one State says that so-called descriptors are
misleading, as was the case under this case, and another
State says, like Illinois said in another case, that
they are not misleading; that national advertising
becomes impossible. That's inconsistent and Congress
expressed what its policy was.
And, Justice Breyer, the Court went through
the same process in the Morales case and the Wolens case
in connection with airline and deregulation and whether
or not misleading advertising might be expressly
pre-empted. The Court went through the same sort of
process in the Riegel case with respect to medical
devices. The Court went through the same process in the
Rowe case, decided on the same day as Riegel in
connection with another context. And again, with
respect to the Reilly case, the Court --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, you're relying
on 1334(b), I take it, specifically.
MR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Stevens. Not just
34(b) but 1331, which it helps explain.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the prohibition you're
talking about is in 13 -- in your express pre-emption
argument -- 1334(b). And I was just going to ask you,
is a State requirement prohibiting false statements
about smoking and health a requirement based on smoking
and health?
MR. OLSON: I think it is, unless I
misunderstood your question. If a State decides what
may be in the advertising or promotion --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The predicate for "based
on smoking" is the word "requirement." And a
requirement that you may not make any false statements,
would that be a requirement based on smoking and health?
MR. OLSON: Well, the statute contains the
words both "requirement" and "prohibition." And in your
plurality opinion in Cipollone on page 527, the same
page I mentioned before, you made the point that a
prohibition is merely the converse of a requirement.
And either a prohibition or a requirement with respect
to advertising if it relates to smoking and health is
pre-empted.
JUSTICE STEVENS: The question I'm asking,
though, is a requirement that you make no false
statements a requirement based on smoking and health?
MR. OLSON: Yes. And to the extent -- no,
we are not saying that the Massachusetts unfair-
practices statute is preempted in all respects. It's
only when the statute, like a common law tort provision
which the Court considered in Riegel, has application to
the context of smoking and health.
If the Court starts with the Morales case
through the Wolens case, through the Bates case, through
the Riegel case, through the Reilly case, it's the
application of the statute in the Reilly case. It was a
-- it was a statute of Massachusetts very much
identical, virtually identical, to the Maine statute
here. And in the -- in the Reilly case the attorney
general was attempting to apply the generalized,
unfair-practice statute to the advertising of smoking
and cigarettes near schools.
This is a similar statute, which is
attempted to be applied in the context of these labels
and the advertising of cigarettes. It's the application
of a generalized statute. This Court repeatedly said,
and specifically said in the Riegel case, there is
hardly any common law requirements which are
requirements, the Court has repeatedly held -- and the
Respondents don't dispute that; they specifically
acknowledge it -- when it's the application of a general
standard to the circumstances of the case. That's where
the pre-emption occurs.
Congress didn't want to pre-empt general
common law standards about fraud or misrepresentation or
anything like that except in the context of the
marketing --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why -- why would
Congress -- I mean the difficulty that the other side
raises here is just what Cipollone said. I can
understand totally why Congress would not want 50 States
telling cigarette companies what to say about health and
smoking or taking off pictures of the Marlboro ad. I
can understand that.
What I can't understand is why Congress
would want to get rid of, in this area, the traditional
rule that advertising has to tell the truth.
Now, what you said was you could end up with
different applications of that in different States. Of
course, every national advertiser faces that situation
at the moment. Everyone who advertises across the
nation could find deceptive -- anti-deception laws
differently administered in different States. Yet,
they'd survive. There is no evidence even that there is
a problem. So why would Congress want to get rid of
that particular statute?
MR. OLSON: Well, the Court -- and this
Court recently in Aetna v. Davila specifically said that
pre-emption can't be decided based upon the label that
the plaintiff puts in the complaint.
Now, as I think every member of this Court
would know, a creative plaintiff's lawyer can call a
claim misrepresentation, willful misrepresentation,
concealment, failure to warn, and so on and so forth.
It's just a matter of how they change the label on the
complaint.
Now, what Congress didn't want -- and I just
gave an example of a situation where Illinois decided
that the descriptors, which are an issue in this case
were not misleading; and it was not -- and they could
continue to be used.
What happened in this case in applying the
Maine statute is a court decided that they were
misleading and -- and couldn't be used.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But did the Illinois --
Illinois court reach the question whether the claim was
pre -- pre-empted? I think it firmly decided on the
merits there was no fraud, if I understand what you
said.
MR. OLSON: That's correct, and I'm not
saying --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So we must assume there
was no pre-emption, because it wouldn't have reached the
merits otherwise.
MR. OLSON: I -- I haven't got all of the
specifics of that case; but what I felt -- I just simply
meant -- but I think it's an example of what you said in
your concurring opinion in Reilly: That if you're going
to conduct a national advertising campaign, it can't be
governed by what a jury might decide in Des Moines
versus what a jury might decide in Birmingham, Alabama.
And --
JUSTICE STEVENS: When it's not --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it the jury fracture?
You said the attorney general could not stop, my
example, "If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our
lights." The attorney general could not proscribe that.
So nothing that you're saying turns on it being the jury
rather than the attorney general, does it?
MR. OLSON: Well, no, that's absolutely --
absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg. In fact, the
panoply of this Court's decisions say that it doesn't
matter whether it's a statute -- a generalized statute
that's being applied or a common law standard that's
being applied, and it does not matter whether it's an
attorney general interpreting and enforcing general
provisions -- I give you Morales and the Wolens
situation -- or it's whether it's a common law tort
action being brought by a plaintiff to submit a case to
a jury a la Riegel.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your position is
essentially that Congress, as -- as far as the
advertising of low or light, Congress empowered one
decisionmaker only and that's the FTC, and if they don't
act then the cigarette companies can say anything they
want about low tar and low nicotine?
MR. OLSON: Well, there is also -- I -- I
think it doesn't -- it's not dispositive of the
pre-emption case, but there's also the master settlement
agreement that the tobacco companies entered into with
the States, which gives the States a lot of power to
enforce various different things.
But I think that the point here is that,
yes, Congress decided that it wanted one uniform source
of regulation of advertising of cigarettes with respect
to smoking and health. Now --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the -- does the
consent decree say anything about advertising low,
light, those specifics?
MR. OLSON: The master settlement agreement?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. OLSON: I -- I don't -- I can't answer
that question. I don't know the answer to that
question, but what I -- I believe that it would allow
broad powers by the attorney generals. But I have --
hasten to say, as I did at the beginning, because some
parties entered into that master settlement agreement I
don't think changes the Federal -- the congressional
intent is very clear. It wanted the -- the statement --
Congress wanted the statements, certain statements, on
cigarette packages. It didn't want any confusion about
what the marketing or promotion of cigarettes would be.
I can't imagine, Justice Ginsburg, a clearer
statement. It says no requirement or prohibition in
section 1334(b). And in 1331 it says "comprehensive
Federal programs that deal with cigarette labeling and
advertising with respect to any relationship between
smoking and health."
JUSTICE SOUTER: But, Mr. Olson, isn't the
problem that Congress was equally clear, or has at least
been assumed to be equally clear, in a contrary line of
reasoning that holds against you? And that line of
reasoning is this: You agree -- everybody agrees --
that the FTC can represent -- it can regulate
advertising and -- and supposed deception on matters
that do affect -- relate to smoking and health.
It is pretty much hornbook law at this stage
of the game that the -- that the FTC's regulation of
deceptive advertising does not exclude State regulation
of deceptive advertising as a general proposition. In
fact, the FTC is very happy to have complementary State
regimes. That state of the law is just as clear. It is
at least as clear as you say the language is here.
Now, given the fact that the FTC can
regulate advertising of cigarettes in -- in the -- in
the respect that matters here, why don't we have to give
some recognition to this complementary regime of State
regulation, which, as a general proposition, survives
MR. OLSON: Well, the point --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And all I'm saying is what
we have here is, you say, a clear preemption provision.
But we also have a clear regulatory regime which is at
odds with that preemption provision, and presumably
we've got to give some effect to that, too.
MR. OLSON: Well, the -- the statute deals
with this to a degree in section 1336 by saving certain
responsibilities. But I think the more powerful answer
is that the background principle, the Federal Trade
Commission Act and Federal and State Trade -- Fair
Practices Act, are a part of a national scheme just
exactly as you said. It's a background --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's part of a
national scheme, but in practical terms you can say that
on any subject matter that the FTC regulates. And,
nonetheless, the complementary State regimes of -- of
regulating deception survive.
So that the argument you are making here is
an argument that can be made, I suppose, on every
subject that the FTC touches.
MR. OLSON: Well, no. As a matter of fact,
I could not disagree more, Justice Souter.  That's the
general background scheme. Then Congress specifically
addresses smoking and health in the advertising of
cigarettes. The same --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Your implied -- your
implied preemption argument would certainly fall prey to
that -- to that point.
MR. OLSON: Well, it -- we have -- I'd like
to spend no time on the implied preemption argument --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Good idea.
MR. OLSON: -- because I think -- I think
this is the -- the -- that Congress could not have been
more clear. And another answer to your question,
Justice Souter, is the Airline Deregulation Act.
You dealt -- you Court dealt with this in
the Morales case and the Wolens case. The -- you could
have said the same thing there: That there is a
background principle against unfair --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Perhaps we did not think of
MR. OLSON: I don't -- I think that it's
clear that, looking at the briefs in that case, that
those very same arguments were made. The same argument
could have been made in the Riegel case with respect to
devices. The general principle that I'm making that I
think Congress understands, and this Court has clearly
understood, is that there is a background principle that
the Federal Government is not pre-empting deceptive
practice regulations except when Congress specifically
says so.
Now, one more point because I think the
white light will come on: the United States Government
did not address in this case the express pre-emption
argument. But a few years ago, in the Reilly case,
having to do with the very same statute, the Cigarette
Labeling Act, the United States Government said that the
labeling act pre-empted State laws concerning the
content of cigarette advertising, the content of
cigarette advertising. That's what the government said
then and the Acting Solicitor General during the
argument in that case, in response to a question by one
of your members of this Court, specifically said the --
the statute would pre-empt State laws about filters or
the safety of a particular cigarette. That was the
position of the United States Government a couple of
years ago and they have not changed.
Mr. Chief Justice, if I may reserve the
balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Olson.
Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice
and may it please the Court:
When Congress enacted the Labeling Act, the
69 Labeling Act, it gave no intention whatsoever to
immunize cigarette makers for the false statements that
they made in violation of anti-deception in the
marketplace rules. They didn't empower the FTC with any
special rulemaking authority that applied industrywide,
and in fact the FTC's enforcement authority with respect
to individual companies was quite limited. The argument
that Philip --
JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Frederick, suppose that
the FTC had adopted the rule that it considered in 1970
and required that the tar and nicotine figures that were
produced by the particular testing method that is at
issue here to be placed on all cigarette ads and
promotions; and then suppose that Maine issued a
regulation requiring that all ads and promotions in the
State of Maine state that the Federal figures are
misleading and should be disregarded. Would that
regulation be pre-empted?
MR. FREDERICK: That would be implied
conflict pre-emption, and we would acknowledge that
would be pre-empted. The difference here --
JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference
between that situation and this situation?
MR. FREDERICK: The difference here is that
between a generally applicable rule that is specially
targeted at the cigarette industry and a generally
applicable rule against deception, upon which a fact
finder would not need to make any special inquiry about
smoking and health.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that
consistent with what the Court said in the Riegel case
where they said, and I'll quote: "We have held that a
provision pre-empting State requirements pre-empted
common law duties"? That's no suggestion that this is a
distinction between a focused common law duty, which
would be unusual anyway, and general common law duty.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, I have three
responses, Mr. Chief Justice. The first is that the
text in Riegel was different; the purposes behind what
Congress enacted in the medical device amendments were
different; and third, this Court twice, in both Reilly
and in Cipollone, has looked at this exact statute and
come to the opposite conclusion.
First with respect to the text of the
medical device amendments, there are several provisions
of that act that are quite a bit broader than what the
69 Labeling Act --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say Riegel
wasn't referring to the particular text of any statue.
It was making a general point. The Court said: We have
held that a provision pre-empting State requirements,
which is exactly what this one does, pre-empted common
law duties.
MR. FREDERICK: And the result, Mr. Chief
Justice, of virtually every one of this Court's
pre-emption cases has been to look at the particular
words of the statute to determine the scope of the
pre-emption. The Court did that in Bates. It did that
in Morales. It did --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So as a general
proposition -- I understand your position to be that
this particular statute doesn't pre-empt the common law
duties, but the distinction I thought you articulated in
response to Justice Alito's question was that general
common law duties are not pre-empted; specific tailored
ones are.
MR. FREDERICK: No.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree that a
general common law duty can be pre-empted by a
particular statute?
MR. FREDERICK: I do acknowledge that,
Mr. Chief Justice. But my point is that in the medical
device amendments what Congress was getting at were
things that were quite a bit broader and it had sweeping
language. It said not only to establish but also to
continue in effect, with respect to a device, which
relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device, or
"to any other matter included in a requirement
applicable to the device."
By contrast --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're -- so
you're saying that we should -- the difference in your
case is that the language here is narrower. It says "no
statement relating to smoking or health." I don't see
how that language is narrower.
MR. FREDERICK: No, I think you're quoting
34(a) and the pre-emption provision at issue here, Mr.
Chief Justice, is 1334(b) which says --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So 1334(b)
says "no requirement or prohibition with respect to."
Isn't that just as broad?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, no, it isn't, because
the modifying term that's at issue in this case comes
between the two points that you quoted, and that's the
phrase "based on smoking and health." Our contention
here is that a generalized duty not to deceive is not a
requirement based on smoking and health. It's based on
a duty not to deceive.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you tell --
how do you tell whether it's deceptive or not if you
don't look at what the relationship is between smoking
and health? They have an advertisement that says light
cigarettes are better for you than regular cigarettes.
You have to know what the relationship is between
smoking and health to determine whether that's
deceptive.
MR. FREDERICK: No, you don't. You have to
look at two products and determine whether or not they
are achieving the same yield of tar and nicotine that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the
relationship between smoking and health.
MR. FREDERICK: And the word "relate" does
not appear in 1334(b), and that is crucial because this
Court in Safeco v. Burr defined the phrase "based upon"
to mean but-for causation: But for smoking and health,
is there a requirement? The words "related to" have
been defined by this Court in numerous pre-emption
cases, including Morales, Wolens, ERISA cases, to be
among the most sweeping language that Congress can use
to denote a connection.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you have -- would
have you been satisfied if your complaint said this
complaint does not seek any damages based on the link
between smoking and health?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, the damages here, Mr.
Justice Kennedy, are -- concern getting two products
that are not different. It's just like going to a car
dealer and saying, I want a Ford and they --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you accept that
amendment to your complaint, that the plaintiff does not
seek any damages based on some link between smoking and
health?
MR. FREDERICK: I think we would accept
that, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE SOUTER: How can you accept that and
then expect to prove damages in the case? You can
accept it to this extent, it seems to me. You can
accept it in saying that what we are going to prove at
step number one is that it is false to indicate that
smoking light cigarettes will result in the ingestion of
less tar and nicotine; and we know why you're saying
that. But in order to prove damages in your case, you
would have to say: People get hurt because there is a
relationship between the ingestion of tar and nicotine
and their health; and the same cause -- the same causal
connection is therefore appropriate for -- for -- is
therefore necessary in order to prove that people were
hurt.
MR. FREDERICK: In fact in our case we are
not proving health-related damages.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're asking for
injunctive relief, I guess.
MR. FREDERICK: No, we are not asking for
injunctive relief. We are asking damages for the
difference in value between a product we thought we were
buying and a product we actually bought.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And the reason -- and the
reason the product is of different value is that in fact
it is dangerous to health, as opposed to -- or more
dangerous or equally dangerous to health as opposed to
less dangerous to health; so that at the causation stage
you've still got to prove the link between causation and
health.
MR. FREDERICK: I don't think so, Justice
Souter. I think all we have to prove is that the
products were different and that we relied materially on
a misrepresentation about what product to use.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you think you could
recover if the evidence showed simply that all your
clients had the health of Olympic athletes?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: You do?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes, I do, because our
damages here, Justice Souter --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What would the harm be,
sort of aesthetic?
MR. FREDERICK: If we bought a product
thinking that it would be a safer product and it was
not, and we would have quit smoking.
JUSTICE SOUTER: If they are healthy as
horses, you have no proof that it is not.
MR. FREDERICK: We're -- yes, we do, because
the product is different. If you buy a car thinking
it's a Ford and it's a Yugo but it still drives, you
still have a claim under the lemon laws for deceptive
advertising.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But what if Yugos and Fords
are worth the same amount of money?
MR. FREDERICK: That is an economic proof --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's the thing here.
Unless you show that for some -- for some reason -- were
light cigarettes sold as a premium? Did they charge
more for light cigarettes?
MR. FREDERICK: There is economic evidence,
Justice Scalia, of a difference in value, and of course
the pre-emption -- the issue here is not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Answer my question. Did
they charge more for light cigarettes?
MR. FREDERICK: They did not charge more for
light cigarettes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So what are your damages?
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, what's the difference
in value?
MR. FREDERICK: Economists have projected
that if a person would have quit smoking and, therefore,
not purchased light cigarettes or would have paid a
different amount of money thinking it was getting a
safer cigarette, there is an economic value --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why would the person have
decided to quit or not to quit? The person would have
made that decision based upon the health consequences.
MR. FREDERICK: Certainly. And the point
here about the advertising --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- you are proving a
point which depends upon the relationship between
smoking and health.
MR. FREDERICK: Justice Souter, I don't
think that the liability requirement here, the rule of
law that is being imposed under Bates -- what Bates said
was that you look at the elements of the claim to
determine whether or not the requirements are imposed by
State law. The requirement that we seek to impose here
is the duty not to deceive --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why couldn't you say
exactly the same thing about a State mode seeks to
protect consumers, and they have a -- they have a rule,
and the rule is not only the cigarette company do you
have to say cigarettes are dangerous to your health, you
have to put skull and crossbones? That's the state law.
And you say why? They say because we are
trying to protect consumers. And then you would be up
here saying, they are not trying -- the duty there is
not the duty to put the skull and crossbones. It's the
duty to protect consumers.
Now, that argument would get nowhere, as you
understand. And they are saying you're making just that
kind of argument here, except substitute the word
"deception".
MR. FREDERICK: We are not making the same
argument here for two reasons: One is that the main
statute is not specially targeted at cigarette smoking.
It's specially targeted at deception in the marketplace.
Under your hypothetical it would be specially targeted
at cigarette companies. Under Reilly that would be
preempted.
Secondly, skull and crossbones I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me before you go. I
don't understand that. It is not specially targeted at
cigarettes and at the harmful health effects of
cigarettes?
MR. FREDERICK: The statute we seek to
invoke is a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a general statute but
in Riegel we -- we took a general statute and looked at
what its specific application in the case was.
MR. FREDERICK: Because the statute --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't get away with
just coming in and saying the general statute is an
anti-deception statute. Didn't we look at what the
application of it was in the case?
MR. FREDERICK: You looked at it because the
statute required you to look at it as applicable, and
the purposes behind that Act were to give the FDA
authority at the premarketing -- and purposes behind the
medical device amendment were completely different. The
FTC does not look at these marketing materials before
the cigarette companies do that.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I want you to
get you to talk about just for me for 30 seconds. I
can't deal with this conceptual thing. It was hard for
me to see it conceptually. I can't understand -- and
that may be enough to any other person here, but I can't
understand somebody saying yes, this language is very
absolute but it doesn't mean to cover everything that it
literally applies to. For example, it probably doesn't
cover a requirement about workers smoking who put up
billboards. And another thing you say it doesn't cover
is traditional anti-deception law. That would have to
do with the purpose of the statute not the text.
I'm not making your argument for you. I'm
giving you an introduction, and I want you to give 30
seconds dealing with the purposes that either says there
is something to that line or there isn't.
MR. FREDERICK: Prior to the enactment of
the 1969 Labeling Act, Congress confronted the spectra
of states imposing warning requirements. And the
tobacco companies went to Congress and said, we do not
want special burdens imposed on us. We don't want
special advantages, but please don't impose special
burdens on the cigarette industry.
And Congress said, we will wipe away the
prospect of state imposing warnings by having a
congressionally mandated warning on the cigarette packs
and in cigarette advertising. The Congress said nothing
about having anti-deception laws be displaced by States.
So that in, in the hair hypo that you gave,
I think Mr. Olson would have to acknowledge that the
cigarette companies were not asking at the time of the
'69 Labeling Act to be free of anti-deception laws.
They had been out for decades saying cigarette smoking
cures the common cold, it makes the throat feel better,
all sorts of health-related claims that were deceptive.
And Congress was not trying to wipe that away.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frederick, did I
understand you earlier to say that your complaint did
not seek injunctive relief?
MR. FREDERICK: We are not here seeking
injunctive relief for this --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Page 42A of your
amended complaint says you ask the Court to grant such
injunctive relief as may be appropriate.
MR. FREDERICK: I misspoke, Mr. Chief
Justice, with apologies to the Court. Our claim here,
though, principally is for damages. And I would also
point out that any injunction that would have been
ordered here would be superseded by the United States
RICO case, where the District Court of the District of
Columbia has already issued an injunction for the use of
light cigarettes because Judge Kessler found in more
than 4,000 findings of fact that Philip Morris had
engaged in deception in the marketplace and findings of
fact, beginning 2023 and following --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, are you
saying that the consent decree -- because we have
overtaken Judge Kessler's decision by consent decree,
right and it has terms? Does a -- does a consent decree
terms allow state attorney generals to say don't
advertise low?
MR. FREDERICK: The consent decree in the
master settlement agreement does not address itself to
specific issues with regard to light and low tar, to my
knowledge. The Kessler order does address the deception
by lights and low tar, and the reason is temporal.
When the master settlement agreement was
entered into in the late '90s, the tobacco companies had
not yet acknowledged publicly that they had been engaged
in deception with respect to studies regarding low tar
and light cigarette. That came to light in 2002, and as
a result of the discovery that occurred in the
government's case and in State cases, the studies that
the cigarette companies knew for decades that there was
no difference in the yield for low tar and light
cigarettes came to light.
And so, the master settlement agreement was
not -- it had certain provisions about the way
cigarettes could be marketed but -- but the Judge
Kessler opinion, in the government's RICO case, actually
makes findings of fact on this score. And the complaint
here essentially tracks the allegations in the
government's. All we seek to do is to provide a remedy
to consumers that have been defrauded by Philip Morris
over these many decades.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could a state attorney
general say under my authority to check against false
and deceptive advertising, no cigarette company can
advertise in this State low or light?
MR. FREDERICK: I think that would fall into
the Reilly line of being preempted, because it would be
specially targeted and there would be no room for a
cigarette maker to say truthfully our product actually
does yield lower and light. So, it could not be a
requirement based on deception. It would have to be a
requirement based on smoking and health under your
hypothetical.
JUSTICE ALITO: Weren't the claims that were
held to be preempted in Cipollone based on general
common law duties?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes, they were. Those --
the fraudulent neutralization of warning claim and the
failure to warn claim were common law claims, Justice
Alito, but the difference here is that in Cipollone the
plurality plus the three Justices who joined Justice
Blackmun's opinion and would have found no common law
claims preempted. Seven Justices found fraud claims
that are virtually identical to ours not to be preempted
because Congress lacked any intent to displace State
laws concerning deception.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Frederick, if I take
away from your oral argument that it is your position
that this suit is not based on a link between smoking
and health, I'm going to have difficulty in accepting
your position in this entire case. Do you have a
secondary position that it is based on a link between
smoking and health but it is subject to a general duty,
that is, that supersedes or is quite in addition to
labeling?
MR. FREDERICK: The requirement is what I
would urge you to focus on, Justice Kennedy. And the
requirement that is being imposed here is not a
requirement that has to do specifically with smoking and
health.
There is a second argument, which is that
even under the application of that generalized duty, the
jury here or the trial court would not be asked to look
at the linkage between smoking and health. It could
simply say, have a scientist up there who says the yield
of a light cigarette is no different than the yield of a
regular cigarette.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do I understand your basic
argument to be that this statute is a prohibition
against State warnings in either promotion or
advertising different from the Federal one?
MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. That was
the general purpose of the statute. There is language,
of course, that --
JUSTICE STEVENS: This specific quotation
deals only with the contents of the advertising that
might be described as warnings different from those in
the Federal scheme.
MR. FREDERICK: That's absolutely correct,
Justice Stevens. And here what we are talking about
with these light descriptors are comparisons between two
products that, in fact, are not different.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your answer to Justice
Ginsburg's question was that the state attorney general
could not impose a regulation that said you must say
that low tar cigarettes have as much nicotine as regular
cigarettes. If the attorney general couldn't do that,
why could the plaintiff do it in his lawsuit?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, the attorney general
could bring the same suit that we bring here, Justice
Kennedy. The difference is between a --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. The hypothetical was
the attorney general requires this as a regulation under
his authority.
MR. FREDERICK: And let me answer the
hypothetical this way: The attorney general can bring
the lawsuit under the State deceptive practices act but
cannot issue a generalized regulation targeted at the
cigarette industry that takes truth completely out of
the equation, because if another cigarette company comes
up and says, "We actually have a light cigarette that is
lower in tar," and we can prove it --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose he wins the
lawsuit -- he wins the lawsuit that it's false and
deceptive to say "low." Could he then have a regulation
that says cigarette companies don't advertise "low" or
"light"?
MR. FREDERICK: I think that's a much more
difficult hypo, but I think the answer is the same and
that would be no, because a regulation would be -- would
be specifically targeted at the industry and it would be
based on smoking and health, not deception.
In an injunctive situation, adjudicatory
facts can evolve. A company can come forward and say
the facts have changed, circumstances have changed,
please modify the injunction. That can't happen when a
generalized regulation is imposed that is specifically
targeted at facts regardless of their truth or veracity.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, can you make that
concrete? What would change about the label "low" or
"light"?
MR. FREDERICK: If the -- if the company
came forward and said, "we redesigned our cigarette,"
and it in fact does yield less tar and nicotine under a
scientifically verifiable test, that would be -- that
would run afoul of the regulation, but it would not run
afoul of the general duty not to deceive.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Frederick.
MR. FREDERICK: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It will not surprise
you that my first question is, why did the United States
not address the express pre-emption argument and,
second, what is the position of the United States on the
express pre-emption argument?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Your Honor, the
United States did not participate on the question of the
scope of the express pre-emption provision in Cipollone,
and to a large extent the express pre-emption question
in this case is what was the meaning of the decision in
Cipollone. And so that is of less interest to the
United States than certainly the second question
presented, which has to do with the FTC's own authority
and its exercise of that authority.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Well,
that's why you didn't address it. Now, what is the
position of the United States? It's a statute that is
directed to an area in which the Federal Government has
an extensive interest in regulation, and I would have
thought there'd be a position on that. It is logically
antecedent to the implied pre-emption. You would
consider whether there is express pre-emption before
implied pre-emption.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Your Honor, the
United States has not taken a position on the bottom
line of the first question presented.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Petitioner says you have in
an earlier case.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I don't believe
that the position that the United States stated in
Reilly is dispositive of the first question presented in
this case. But, again, that doesn't mean that the brief
that the United States has filed with respect to implied
pre-emption is not relevant.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's not
anymore. I understood -- I understood Mr. Olson to give
up on implied pre-emption in his opening argument.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Implied pre-emption
is all that you address, right?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But we --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it should be
pretty easy for you to win on that.
(Laughter.)
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I would hope so.
Thank you.
But we also address a question that is
common to the two questions presented, and that is an
argument that the Petitioners make with respect to
implied pre-emption, but they also make it with respect
to express pre-emption, and that is -- and, Justice
Ginsburg --
JUSTICE ALITO: Does the FTC at this point
in 2008 have an opinion about whether the tar and
nicotine figures that are produced by this testing
method are meaningful or misleading?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, as Your Honor
is aware, we submitted a -- a supplemental authority
letter that in July of this year the Commission issued a
request for comment on a proposal to rescind its
guidance with respect to the tar and nicotine test
results, precisely because of concern that they are
misleading due to the evidence that has developed about
the incidence of compensation. That was not believed at
the time that the Commission issued its guidance back in
66 and '67 to present a significant problem. But it
is evident now. The scientific community indicates and
certainly the findings of fact in the RICO case are that
the -- that the tobacco companies have known since 1967
that in fact compensation is nearly complete, and for
that reason, the tar and nicotine yields via the
Cambridge test method are not indicative of the yield to
a true human smoker. And for that reason, it proposed
to withdraw.
JUSTICE ALITO: Would it be -- would it be
unfair to say that for quite sometime now, nearly 40
years, the FTC has passively approved the placement of
these tar and nicotine figures in advertisement?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: With respect to the
-- I want first to take issue with the question of
"approved," because I think that it -- it draws an
analogy to the FDA context, to Riegel and the like, and
that is not the nature of what the Federal Trade
Commission does. It doesn't stand --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you passed a rule to
require it, did you not?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: We proposed a rule
to require the disclosure of tar and nicotine --
JUSTICE ALITO: And you withdrew that after
the companies voluntarily agreed to place the
information on the ads --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's correct.
JUSTICE ALITO: -- and entered into consent
decrees with other companies requiring them to put
information in their ads.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. The consent
decrees did not require them to put the information in
their ads. It said that it would be deceptive to make
claims about the tar and nicotine content of the
cigarettes without expressing, in milligrams, what the
yield was per the Cambridge test method. But that's a
very different thing. It's a prohibition. They were
ordered to cease and desist making claims about tar and
nicotine content without giving the consumer the benefit
of the yield figures. But the Commission has never --
specifically at issue in this case are the descriptors
"light" or "lower in tar." In 1987, the Commission
issued a notice in which it said these terms are are not
defined by Federal law. They asked whether there should
be --
JUSTICE ALITO: Was there a different
between saying "light" and saying "lower in tar" in
accordance with the Cambridge testing method?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes, Your Honor,
because the -- the "light," on its own, much more
conveys the impression to the consumer that this is the
yield to the consumer himself, the actual human smoker,
and in fact that was why the --
JUSTICE ALITO: The FTC's position seems to
me incomprehensible. If these figures are meaningless,
then you should have prohibited them -- are misleading,
you should have prohibited them a long time ago. And
you've created this whole problem by, I think, passively
approving the placement of these figures on the -- on --
in the advertisements. And if they are misleading, then
you have misled everybody who's bought those cigarette
for a long time.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: They -- whether
they are or are not misleading depends upon the
incidence of compensation. At the time the Commission
issued its guidance in 1966 and '67, the HEW report was
that compensation was not expected to be a problem. It
was not believed to be a problem. Beginning in 1983,
when in light of the Barclay's case in which it was
determined that a particular cigarette, the yield
according to the test method had nothing to do with
yield to an actual consumer, the FTC started to inquire
about this.
But the Petitioners, although they have
known since 1967 about the incidence of compensation,
failed to disclose that information to the Commission.
They have failed to -- they have refused to give them
the benefit of their insights, their own studies. The
Commission has asked --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The Commission -- when did
the Commission know of this stuff? I had a case when I
was on the Court of Appeals, so it had to be before 1984
involving so-called lip drape --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: You're right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- by which the smoker
covers up the little holes that bring in some fresh air.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In 1978 --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's been general knowledge
for a long time, and the FTC has done nothing about it.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There has been a
question. In 1978, the Commission issued a notice
requesting comment about whether lip drape in fact
occluded the holes that dilute the concentration of the
air, and the tobacco companies did not respond to that,
even though they had their own studies showing that it
was a problem. So it is -- it is true that the
Commission has only now issued the notice proposing to
withdraw its earlier guidance; but the Petitioners
themselves should not be able to benefit from their own
misleading of the Commission.
But again, I think it's more fundamental
than that, is that their arguments rely upon a
misconception of what the Commission does. As Justice
Souter noted, it is Supreme Court law the Commission
does not supplant State law; it acts cooperatively with
State law. The Commission does not act as a gatekeeper
like FDA in approving things. It acts as a law
enforcement agency. It goes after fraud when it is
--
aware of it. But that is not to the exclusion of State
law enforcement agencies or other Federal law
enforcement agencies.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask a question? I
plan to go back and see what the Government said in
the -- in the case that Petitioner asserts you have
effectively supported his position on -- on express
pre-emption. I plan to go back and read it. Assuming I
agree with him rather than you, has the government's
position changed from what it was then? As far as you
know, is the government's position still the same, the
position that you delicately did not bring to our
attention?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is in the Reilly
case.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The Reilly case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. In Reilly. I haven't
read the brief there, I must say. But suppose I agree
with Petitioner. Can I assume --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Of course --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And do you assume that it's
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The position of the
United States as stated in the Reilly case was that the
express guarantee provision did not pre-empt a
regulation of the nature in that case. It was our
position that that, because it was --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm not asking about --
I'll figure that out on my own. Trust me. I can
probably figure that out. But once I have figured it
out, can I assume that that is still the government's
position --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- whatever it is?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I would think
that we would need to revisit the question in light of
this Court's holding in Reilly, in light of the
additional precedents that there have been over the last
decade or whatever it's been since that decision was
issued. So --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You have no idea which
direction that would lead?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: We have not taken a
position on the first -- on the bottom line of the first
question presented. Although as I say --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm going to hold you to
your last position, just -- just for fun.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Olson, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
We haven't given up the implied pre-emption argument,
but I --
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You just didn't want
to argue it.
MR. OLSON: I -- we feel that we explained
it very thoroughly in our briefs, and I thought knowing
that the time was limited I thought we should focus on
the strongest argument I think by any stretch of the
imagination, when Congress has spoken directly.
Now, first of all, with respect to what the
Solicitor General on behalf of the United States says,
and this is in response to the point that Justice Scalia
was just addressing -- page 1 of the Reilly brief, the
Attorney General is responsible for enforcing the
Labeling Act. So it is the government's responsibility,
according to them, to enforce the Labeling Act.
Then on pages 8 and 9 of their brief,
distinguishing between the location of the billboards in
that case and other things that would be pre-empted,
pages 8 and 9, the Government said the Labeling Act
preempts State laws concerning the content of cigarette
advertising with respect to smoking and health. And the
Acting Solicitor General on page 25 of the transcript of
the argument that day in this case was asked that
question, what is pre-empted? And she said it pre-empts
State law claims about filters or the safety of a
particular cigarette. That is this case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't the point, it doesn't
pre-empt rules about location; it pre-empts rules about
content?
MR. OLSON: That was the government's point.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the government's
position. Now, if that's their position, isn't it just
one additional step to say depending on what the history
of the statute is, that it pre-empts regulations about
content that don't have to do with lying about the
content?
MR. OLSON: It has to do according to what
Congress said about the content of the advertising and
the promotion of cigarettes; that's what this case is
about when it has to do with smoking and health.
Now, my opponent seems to run away, in
answer to your question, about what if we take out
smoking and health from their complaint? Well, they
can't take out smoking. That is everywhere in the
complaint. I asked the Court to sit down and compare
the labeling statute with the complaint. And the words
are indistinguishable, and they say over and over again
and on page 4A of -- then Mr. Frederick's saying well,
all they want is economic damages. They are really
not -- they are just concerned about they got one
cigarette and they wanted to get another cigarette.
Page 4A, this is the way the Court of Appeals understood
it. This is page 4A of the petition appendix: the
plaintiffs explain that the relative levels of these
substances bear on a reasonable consumer's decision on
which cigarette to purchase, because consumers
understand that reducing the quantities of tar and
nicotine in cigarettes reduces their adverse health
effects. That is what this case is all about.
Now, I will just conclude in this way. The
statute in the language of this Court in the Reilly
case, uses "sweeping language." The language is every
bit as sweeping as the language in the airline
deregulation act that uses the phrase relates to, I
submit.
So there is three requirements. Either --
the statute prohibits, any and it uses the phrase "any,"
you can't get more expansive than that; and it uses the
word "no" requirements or prohibition. The Court has
dealt with requirements and prohibition in Reilly,
Cipollone, Bates, Wolens, Riegel. The statute that we
are talking about here in this case is the same statute
essentially that it was dealing with in Reilly. It's
the State Unfair Practices Act. It was
Massachusetts/Maine; but I compared the statutes side by
side. They essentially the same.
Is the requirement based upon smoking and
health? Well, the complaint specifically says so. The
relief is based upon the relationship between smoking
and health and is it in promotion or advertising of
tobacco? Again, they've said that over and over again.
I submit that the statute could not be more clear. This
particular complaint seeks to impose a regulation --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it correct that your
argument requires us to reject the fraud analysis in
Cipollone?
MR. OLSON: Yes. I believe it does.
However, Justice Stevens, I believe when you talked
about in that -- the plurality opinion, you talked about
minimizing, reducing, negating the effect of the warning
labels. That's also this complaint. This as a
complaint is identical so what you were referring to on
page 527 of Cipollone.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Olson. The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the
