Mr. Goldstein.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
As this case comes to the Court, two things
I think are uncontested. The first is that at this
trial, the prosecution suppressed all of the evidence in
its files that went to the single most important
contested issue of the case, and that's whether the
defendant was a drug addict and committed the crimes in
an amphetamine psychosis.
And the second is that as soon as the
Petitioner found out about the suppression, he presented
his Brady claim to the State courts. In this --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is also a
third thing that's uncontested, which is there is no
Brady claim on the merits. That's not at all included
in your question presented. The district court and the
court of appeals concluded that there was no Brady
violation on the merits. I don't know what would happen
if we sent this case back. They would conclude it
again.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice,
there are a couple issues that you've raised. Can I
first address the question of whether it's encompassed
within the question presented on the merits, because the
question is, well, is this all just an academic exercise
because the procedural default holding wouldn't change
the ultimate outcome in the case?
The answer is that it is, we think, fairly
encompassed within the question presented, and I can
explain why, including with respect to the text of the
question presented.
The court of appeals in this case disavowed
deciding the merits of the Brady claim. And let me take
you to the petition appendix, and that is at page 22a
and again at 24a. So I'm just trying to walk you
through what the court of appeals said at the very top
of 22a: "We, therefore, will not disturb our decision
that Cone's Brady claims are procedurally defaulted and
not before this court."
And then on 24a, at the bottom of the first
full paragraph, the last sentence: "We again find that
Cone's claims are procedurally defaulted and we reject
Cone's request to reconsider his Brady claims."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but don't stop
there. On page 25a, they've been talking about those
federalism issues. They say: "We need not be delayed
by these interesting questions of federalism, however,
because in all events the documents discussed in the
dissenting opinion that were allegedly withheld are not
Brady material."
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. I
was not going to stop, and I was going to just point out
the dilemma that I faced when I wrote the cert petition.
So, on the one hand, they disavowed deciding
it, and then quite clearly there are some -- there are a
couple paragraphs there, you've start -- you've stated
one, the next paragraph says the same thing -- talking
about the merits of the Brady claim. So here's the
dilemma that I faced in writing the cert petition. They
say they're not deciding the Brady claim, but then they
talk quite clearly about it. So I expressed --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but don't --
you've resolved your dilemma by not raising anything at
all about the merits in the question presented?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I
disagree, and let me explain why. If you go to the cert
petition, of course, which you have in front of you,
starting on page 26 --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's start on
page Roman xi, where the questions presented are.
There's nothing in there about the merits of the Brady
claim. It's all about the procedural objections that
you have.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and I --
the document, of course -- let's -- let's talk about the
text of the question presented, and then I'll give my
explanation. So, the question presented it says is
"Whether Petitioner is entitled to Federal habeas review
of his claim that the State suppressed material evidence
in violation of Brady v. Maryland?" We thought --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I guess what I
would say is you've got - habeas review of that claim
because the district court decided it on the merits and
the court of appeals decided it on the merits.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I
have explained why it is, and if I can then take you to
the rest of the body of the cert petition. The doctrine
that I'm going to rely on is the question -- the issue
is, is it fairly encompassed within the question
presented? So the dilemma I have described to you is
the one I faced. The court of appeals said it wasn't
deciding the Brady claim, then it talked about it.
Then -- so, in the body of the cert
petition, which you all looked to in my experience in
determining what's fairly encompassed, there are two
headings for the reasons for granting the writ. The one
is the procedural one. Then starting on page 26, we
present the merits question of the merits of the Brady
claim.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. It seems to
me you either did not raise the question or you did.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you did not, then
we don't address the procedural issues that you raised.
If you did, then also we have to resolve the question on
the merits, a very fact-specific Brady claim that we
would not normally take without reaching those
procedural issues. So, I don't see why the procedural
issues are before us.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, can
I -- can I answer the -- finish answering my question
about the body of the cert petition and then come to
this? I'm glad to do it in whichever order. I do have
a couple of important points to make on your very
understandable question about what's fairly encompassed
within the question presented.
The particular place that I want to point
the Court to, so starting on 26, we lay out our argument
about the merits, and then footnote 6 explains quite
clearly to the Court -- the Court sometimes has a
concern that parties are smuggling questions into the
case in front of it, and that's clearly what did not
happen here. We explain our dilemma about the Sixth
Circuit saying it wasn't deciding the merits, and then
footnote 6, because the panel -- this is on page --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where am I going to find
footnote 6?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Footnote 6 at page 30 of the
cert petition, sir.
"Because the panel disavowed deciding the
merits of Petitioner's Brady claim in the language that
I quoted you to, and discussed the question only in
dictum, Petitioner's counsel have concluded that it
would not be permissible to state that issue as a
distinct question presented."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our -- our cases
clearly hold that when you have alternate holdings,
neither one is dicta.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sir, the -- but it was
disavowing it, I think, as an alternate holding. The
court of appeals opinion is not clear. It disclaims the
power even to decide the Brady claim.
And if I can just finish the footnote, it
really is only two sentences long: "This Court could,
of course, reach the issue either by directing the
parties to brief it or by recognizing that it is fairly
encompassed within the question as described in the
petition."
Then the brief in opposition to cert is only
about the merits of the claim, and our reply brief on
cert, if you go to page 4 of the cert reply brief, then
clearly identifies this question for the Court again.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's fair
for the Respondents to say, look, there's no reason to
take this procedural -- complicated procedural issue,
because we win on the merits. And the court, as their
view articulates, the court decided that question.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I agree it was
perfectly fair for them. But the question that I'm
trying to address, and I apologize if I've misunderstood
the question, is did we sufficiently identify for you
all in the question that we presented the Court what the
issues were, and so that you were agreeing to decide the
procedural question, the merits question, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How -- how long has this
case been going on? When -- when was -- when was the
crime?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: In 1980, August of 1980.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The crime was committed in
80, 28 years ago.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And when was the -- when
was the conviction and the sentence of death pronounced?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Very soon thereafter, within
a couple of years.  This -- let me answer that and make
sure that I've resolved --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you want to go back
down again, for another --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SCALIA: How old is this -- is this
defendant?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: He's around 50 years old
now.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And when -- when did the
court indicate in -- in Tennessee that you had access to
the file?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. In the Woodall case,
years after the crime, Justice Scalia, so all the
evidence was suppressed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I thought that was
00 -- when was that?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: In 1992.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: 1992.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: In 1992 he was granted
access to the files. He immediately stated, right away
- it's uncontested -- his Brady claim. And then Justice
Scalia, the case went on --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the Brady claim has
been pending in the Federal courts but just not decided
since about 2001?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, sir. So there's no
question about timeliness. Justice Scalia, your
frustration about how long in this case is perfectly
understandable, how long they take. But let me just be
clear that this --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was -- it was
decided. It was decided -- wasn't it decided the first
time around? I mean, the Chief Justice calls your
attention to page 25a. The reason the court said
they're not Brady material -- we said it before, we said
it the last time the case was before the court.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I took Justice
Kennedy's question to be that this has been in the case
all along and hasn't been finally resolved, there isn't
a final judgment. You're quite right that, as the Chief
Justice pointed out, there is language in the court of
appeals' very first opinion in the case. There is
unfortunately only one sentence, but to be fair there is
a sentence in the first opinion saying that it's not --
that Brady evidence is not material.
But I -- I did want to come back to why this
has been in the courts for so long. When he presented
it immediately, Justice Kennedy, to the State courts,
the State told the State courts that it had been
previously determined. It -- it no longer defends that.
It just wasn't true. And that caused the whole thing to
go off the rails, because we have been trying ever since
the day that we got access to the materials to get one
full adjudication of the claim.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess it's -- my
questions and the questions and the points --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that was raised
about the time are related, because one reason these
things drag on interminably is that you are -- exactly
why you're raising this issue here, it's a procedural
nicety or a procedural difficulty that arose some time
ago in the State courts. But since then the Federal
courts, both the district court and the court of appeals
have addressed it, and -- and that that's a good
jurisprudential approach to say, particularly in a
complicated case like this that is 26 years old, here's
our answer on this, but so that we don't have to go
through this again, if we're reversed on that, here's
our -- our alternative holding; and they said right
after the sentence I quoted, we said this before, and we
now say it again: This is not Brady material.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. So, Mr. Chief
Justice, it seems to me, though you and I might disagree
on what's fairly encompassed, we might have one piece of
common ground, and that is it's time to bring this all
to a close; that there really isn't a big benefit to
having Cone 4 and 5, and that's actually what we have
asked the Court to do. Now we are not --
JUSTICE ALITO: I thought what you asked us
to do was to reverse on the procedural default issue and
remand the case.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: We -- we do do that. We
also say, however, that if the Court believes that the
Sixth Circuit has reached the merits, then this Court
should address what are the undefended -- the -- what
the Sixth -- the State does not contest are legal errors
in its assessment of the merits. The Kyles --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would -- that
would then depend on us agreeing to review a very
fact-bound, necessarily fact-bound, Brady question when
the questions presented focused on a procedural issue.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, first of all, Mr.
Chief Justice, there -- we have two different sets of
errors that we think exist with respect to the Brady
claim. I'm not avoiding the question of whether it's
encompassed, and I'll come back to it. But to your
first point, we do identify what we think are clear
legal mistakes by the lower courts in -- whether it's a
holding or dictum, not to get into -- enter into that
debate, we explain that the Sixth Circuit avowedly split
the evidence into sort of four different silos or
categories, and we think inconsistently with Kyles v
Whitley, and we think the lower courts were wrong not to
hold an evidentiary hearing.
Now, those aren't fact-bound points; those
are questions of law, so we believe that it would be
perfectly appropriate for this Court to decide the
procedural question. The procedural holding of the
Sixth Circuit is not defended here, the idea that
previous determination amounts to a procedural default.
And then on the question of the merits, the Court could
decide those two limited legal questions and leave it to
the lower courts to decide the more fact-bound
questions.
But we do think that the Court -- it is
actually quite sensible for this Court to not justify
the procedural question, given that it's a very weak --
call it holding, call it dictum -- the Sixth Circuit has
sent strong signals about what it views regarding the
merits of the Brady claim.
JUSTICE ALITO: That seems to me to be
directly contrary to what you say in your brief. The
last sentence of your brief: "This case can accordingly
be properly resolved more narrowly by remanding the case
to the district court for consideration of the merits of
the Brady claim in the first instance."
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, sir, that -- that is
something that the Court can do. We explained in the
preceding pages what would happen in the district court,
and that is we think that there needs to be an
evidentiary hearing and that the -- the Court should
point out the Kyles error. But in all events, that
would still be a sufficient ground for reversal. But I
think we could all agree --
JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a question
about -- on the procedural default issue?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO: Could you -- could you put
yourself in the position of the Tennessee Court of
Criminal Appeals? In light of the briefing that they
received, if you had been on that court, would you have
understood that Petitioner was asserting that he had a
valid reason for not raising the Brady claim earlier,
because he had not -- at the time when he could have, at
the time of the prior proceedings, he had not had access
to the State records? Would you have understood that
from the briefing that they got?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: I would have, although I
would have -- I understand your concern about whether it
was fully elaborated and sufficiently so. This of
course was not the procedural default theory that has
been argued in this case before now.
JUSTICE ALITO: Was that mentioned in -- in
either the principal brief or the -- or the reply brief,
the reason why it wasn't raised earlier?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Insofar as the defendant,
Mr. Cone, told the court of appeals as to paragraph 35
and 41, the court of appeals should look at the
affidavit. It did not say what the contents of the
affidavit was as to the Brady claim.
Now, I will point you to one particular
point, Justice Alito, on the question of whether we
fairly preserved this in the State Court of Criminal
Appeals -- I guess two points that hopefully will give
you some comfort there.
The first is that in the entire long course
of this litigation, the State has never before made this
argument; and the second is in the Tennessee Supreme
Court -- the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals decides
the case. We take the Brady claim up to the Tennessee
Supreme Court. And even there the State doesn't say
that it was insufficiently preserved. They file a
response to our application and they address it as to
its substance.
They never made this argument even in the
State courts. So I think it -- it could have been
better briefed. The reason -- by the way, let me just
explain to you why --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How many claims were -- was
this a case where there, what, 81 separate claim counts?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- it -- I don't think
there were --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I can understand
giving a lick and a promise to -- to each one if you
come up with 81.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: 52.
JUSTICE SCALIA: 52. Close enough. I'll
say the same for 52.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- but when we got to my
point in the Tennessee Supreme Court, there was much
less action in the case. The Brady claim was point
three, there was a lot less that was presented in the
case.
Look, I don't think -- my point is not to
say that the State, you know, inexplicably behaved
horribly here. There could have been better briefing on
both sides of this thing. What I'm saying here, though,
is that the Petitioner right away presented what is a
very serious Brady claim to the State courts. He didn't
abandon it; he fully presented it; and what he wants is
one shot.
There is a footnote in the district court's
opinion. There are two, three sentences in the second
opinion and one sentence in the first opinion of the
Sixth Circuit. But nobody has sat down and done this
and disposed of the merits of this claim as anything
other than a -- an aside, and it is a very serious
claim.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what --
can you tell me what is this -- let's suppose that --
that you have -- had an initial Brady claim that there
was one part of the file that you were entitled to see
that said that there is some evidence that he's a drug
addict -- user. And you take that Brady claim up.
Later you find out -- you have access to a
new file and you find cumulative information plus the
information that he was dazed or something, which may
not be very -- what's our test to determine whether the
Brady claim has been exhausted?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Uh --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or have we talked about
that?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, this is, I think,
similar to the Bell v. Kelly question, the case that the
Court did on when you present a Brady claim and the
State courts evaluate the merits of that Brady claim,
and then you find out other material later, and the
question becomes, how much deference you owe to the
State courts the first go-around.
This is a very different case. The -- all
of this evidence in the file appeared at one time.
There weren't -- it wasn't split, and the only time a
Brady claim was disposed of was at the time this Brady
claim was disposed of. After the Woodall files that you
mentioned became available to the Petitioner, right then
and there, he added -- there was paragraph 35 and
paragraph 41 of his post-conviction application that
were added within a couple months of each other. The
State court right away, at the urging of the State,
said, oh, that's been previously determined, and I won't
consider the merits.
So this is not a case in which the State
court has assessed a Brady claim and said we don't think
there's any Brady issue here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your proposal would
be that they would never do it because you want to send
it back to the Federal district court, and it's -- and
if the State was laboring under misapprehension, it
thought that, because he brought up the issue twice, he
had somehow been defaulted, everyone can agree that that
didn't make sense.
But now you're proposing that the State
court will not be the one to look at these materials;
instead it will be the Federal court. I think there was
something that Judge Merritt said in his dissent that
indicated he thought that the State court ought to be
the one to do this close examination. Didn't -- didn't
he propose a stay of the Brady claim in the Federal
court pending exhaustion of that claim in the State
court?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't know that he made a
concrete proposal. I think he would prefer -- I think
the court system would prefer it, and I think everyone
would prefer it. The dilemma is that it can't happen.
As we explain in footnote 3 at page 26 of our reply
brief, there is no window of opportunity to send the
State -- the case back to the State. It's been
dismissed there. The statute of limitations has run.
And in a case called Harris v. State, the Tennessee
Supreme Court said that you couldn't reopen it.
And so we -- we're not saying we want a
Federal judge rather than a State judge. We're just
saying we want a judge, and our problem is that,
understanding that there has been some discussion of the
merits, it has been very thin --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I didn't look,
counsel, at your -- I don't know if it's yours or your
predecessor counsel's brief in the -- appealing from the
district court here to the court of appeals. Did that
raise a discussion of the Brady claim on the merits,
saying that the district court was wrong?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, it did. And so we have
-- we did try to present it to the Sixth Circuit. The
Sixth Circuit accepted a finding of procedural default
that is undefended in this court, and I did want to -- I
had just started to get to this --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was -- that was
not a friendly question. My point is that you argued
the merits of the Brady claim not only in the district
court but specifically on appeal as well.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: It wasn't a friendly
question --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this wasn't sort
of sua sponte addressing --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the Brady claim
as kind of a safety net on the procedural --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: It wasn't a friendly
question, but it was an honest answer.
(Laughter.)
MR. GOLDSTEIN: And we did present the
question to the court of appeals. We think when it said
we don't have the power, it was disavowing it. But even
-- Mr. Chief Justice, even assuming that the court of
appeals had a whole section in its opinion saying, we're
deciding the merits of the Brady claim, my constraint
was, in framing the question presented, as I explained
in that footnote in the cert petition -- and I would
also encourage you to read, I didn't get to the language
in it, in our reply brief. We have a whole paragraph
that explains -- this is at page 4 -- "First, even if
this Court were to conclude that the court of appeals
had reached the merits of Petitioner's Brady claim,
notwithstanding the Sixth Circuit's own repeated
disavowals of doing so, then the merits of that Brady
claim ruling would be properly before this Court, not
immunized from review. Indeed, the Brady issue, as
encompassed within the questions presented, would be
properly briefed by the parties if certiorari were
granted."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. No, my -- my
concern is not that you didn't brief the Brady claim; it
is that -- whatever the non-pejorative synonym for
"smuggled" it in -- is you smuggled it in on a case that
purportedly presented a procedural objection and a
conflict on a procedural issue.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's -- I don't think,
pejorative or not, that it's fair to accuse us of
smuggling it. There's a big section in the cert
petition about it. It's not -- it was not hidden from
-- I don't -- I don't purport to tell the Court what it
was thinking when it granted cert in this case, but I
tried to be as clear as absolutely possible.
I was turning to the question of whether we
have a serious Brady claim and so the Court should have
some concerns here, and I really do think that we do and
that the passing observations about the lower courts
don't fulfill the duty to assess the merits of the Brady
claim fairly. There was one -- the action in this case,
the whole reason that there was effectively a trial, was
the question of whether the defendant committed these
acts in an amphetamine psychosis. He had two experts
that explained, because of his post-traumatic stress
disorder and his very heavy drug issue, that he did not
understand the consequences of his action. He was
completely paranoid.
And the State went after those experts by
saying he is not a drug user at all; he's a drug dealer;
when all the while in their files, there were -- Justice
Kennedy, to distinguish the hypothetical you gave -- FBI
teletypes, police reports, witness statements from
before the day of the robbery, soon thereafter in
Florida, explaining that he was not just a heavy drug
user, but was acting -- the witness was asked, Did he
act like he was on drugs? And the witness said, yes, he
did. That that really would have made a difference in
at the very least the sentencing phase in this case to
at least --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that colloquy?
I remember witnesses saying he looked weird, he looked
wild-eyed. Where was the answer that he looked --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, this is in
the yellow brief, our merits reply brief. It starts at
the very bottom of 21, but you can just start at the top
of 22.
And as to this question -- so we're talking
here about the evidence, not just that he was a drug
user, which, I think, would have been relevant to the
jury, but that he actually was on drugs in August of
80 at the time all this was happening. There's a
robbery -- there are two robberies here that precede
these killings, and there's a -- the first one, there's
a statement about the robbery right before the murders
confirming that the Petitioner -- he was asked, Did he
appear to be drunk or high? And the witness said, yes,
he did because "he acted real weird."
The next one is that the day of the -- at
the jewelry store robbery that immediately preceded the
killings, that the Petitioner looked wild-eyed, and then
soon thereafter a police officer reports in Florida that
he looks "agitated" and "looking about in a frenzied
manner."
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know, I'll give
you the first, that he appeared drunk or high. That's
pretty clear, but I think you tend to look wild-eyed
after you're running out after a jewelry store robbery,
and I think you're -- you're certainly inclined to look
"agitated" and "looking about in a frenzied manner" when
you've just committed two brutal murders. I don't think
that's evidence of drug addiction at all, of being under
the influence of drugs.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I don't doubt for a
second that that's exactly the argument that the
prosecution would have made. The question is whether a
juror, in the context of the expert testimony and the
evidence about drug addiction, could have also found
that it was consistent with the idea that he was high on
drugs, whether you can have confidence in saying now --
particularly if you'll give me the first statement. And
all the FBI teletypes and the police reports that said
-- remember this is not just a case about suppression of
evidence. This is a case where the prosecution, with
all this stuff in its files, goes after the experts and
argues to the jury that he's a drug dealer, not a drug
user.
JUSTICE ALITO: This is a very complicated
factual question, isn't it? We're dealing with numerous
documents, isn't that right, that you claim are --
MR. GOLDSTEIN: There are key witness
statements, and there are a series of police reports and
FBI --
JUSTICE ALITO: And so you would have to
evaluate all of those and evaluate the prejudice against
what was in the record, and you're suggesting now that
this is something we should decide?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Two points, Justice Alito.
The first is that we say at the very least the Court
should make the Kyles point and the evidentiary hearing
point. And the second is, I think to be fair to us,
given your point about this is so complicated, there is
a lot of evidence here, one ought to compare that in
fairness to what the Sixth Circuit did, and the one
footnote that the Chief Justice has talked about with
the district court and whether they really did take a
hard look at the claim. I think it would be fair to us
to say, look, there are some legal errors here that this
Court can correct, and then the district court would be
the proper place, if it decides to have an evidentiary
hearing, to resolve the remainder of the claim.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask just one quick
question: Is it your view that the evidence was
deliberately suppressed or negligently suppressed?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Deliberately suppressed,
although it doesn't matter under Brady. There was --
they turned over almost nothing, and this was the heart
of our case. They knew that we were conceding that the
acts had been committed, and our defense was one of
insanity, and it was our only argument in mitigation of
the death penalty.
If I could --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You recognize that a -- a
defense like this, that the defendant was high on drugs,
that isn't ambivalent? I mean, a jury, just like it
might react adversely to the defendant if he says I was
drunk on alcohol, that they might say this is a person
who put himself in this condition where his will could
be overpowered, this is a voluntary act, why should we
consider it, why should we consider it mitigating, we --
we could just as well consider it aggravating?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: It -- it could, and that's
why I think it's very important that our defense was
amphetamine psychosis brought on by post traumatic
stress disorder from honorable service in Vietnam, not
just that he was a target.
If I could reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Smith.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER L. SMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
As the Court has alluded in a number of
questions, both the district court and the Sixth Circuit
now twice have resolved -- have rejected Cone's Brady
claim on the merits, and we believe correctly so in
light of Cone's actions in the day surrounding the
murder, his statements about what he did and why he did
it, and more importantly the lower court's recognition
that additional evidence --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- let me get
something on the table. Do you agree that the evidence
shows that this evidence was deliberately suppressed?
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I don't think
there's been any -- any finding about the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But is there any
explanation for -- was there any explanation for it
other than the tactical explanation?
MS. SMITH: There's no explanation in the
record, there has been no finding about whether the
evidence has been suppressed at all in this case because
both the district court and the Sixth Circuit decided as
a matter of law that the materials --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to be relevant
because if it was suppressed for tactical reasons, it
seems to me hard to say that the prosecution thought it
didn't make any difference.
MS. SMITH: Well, again, there has --
there's been no finding on that, because each court, and
I think more than just in a passing statement, each
court that looked at it, both the district court and the
Sixth Circuit, have looked point by point, especially in
the district court --
JUSTICE STEVENS: What they -- one of the
first questions always troubles me in a Brady case is
the conduct of the prosecutor and the ethics of the
profession, the whole -- whole importance of the rule is
to be sure prosecutors perform their public function.
And I'm just wondering if there is any -- if this was a
case of just an honest mistake, it would be one thing,
but if it appears to have been a tactical decision and a
tactical program, it seems to me very difficult to
assume that the prosecutor thought it was really not
important evidence.
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I certainly
understand the Court's concern, and I'll just -- and
again reiterate, there has not been any finding on that,
but there is at least a suggestion in the record that
some of the evidence on which the Petitioner is relying
at this point actually wasn't suppressed. And we noted
this in our brief, specifically as to the witness Ilene
Blankman.
All of the individual items on which the
Petitioner is traveling now were the subject of
cross-examination, so that at least raises the question
about whether --
JUSTICE BREYER: Blankman, that isn't the
concern. The concern is simply this: If they're
correct, that this whole trial revolves around whether
this individual is suffering post traumatic stress
disorder with these amphetamines.
They have two expert witnesses who say that
he's in very bad shape, everything the defense wanted
them to say; that's it. That's their evidence.
On cross, the prosecutor gets both of them
to admit that they're basing their testimony on what the
defendant told them about his drug use. At which point
the prosecutor says, let's talk to Mr. Roby, who is the
arresting officer, did you see he was on -- when you
arrested him, was he on -- did he look like he was on
drugs? No.
Let's talk to Mr. Flynn. When you processed
him, did he look like he was on drugs? No. And then
let's talk to Ms. Blankman, okay?
So, now the case is submitted, and at that
point the prosecutor says, there is no evidence that he
was on drugs. He said that. Two, those two expert
witnesses, and it's baloney. There's your case.
Now, in fact in the files is evidence that
Mr. Roby, that very day of the crime and the next day,
sent out all-points bulletins saying he was a dangerous
drug user. There is evidence in the files that Mr. --
that the FBI man sent out similar all-point bulletins.
There are three witnesses who have described the
behavior of the day as frenzied, and we have heard the
descriptions.
And you're saying that the lawyer, the
trained lawyer for the government, who knew this
information and knew the defense just what? Just
overlooked it by accident? Just what?
MS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I can't speak
for the prosecutor's state of mind at the time, but I
will -- will state that the central question in the case
was not whether the Petitioner used drugs. There was
evidence in the record from his mother, there was
evidence in the record from his own mouth --
JUSTICE SCALIA: He was conceded that he was
a drug user.
MS. SMITH: That's exactly right. It came
through the State's own --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that he was dangerous
because he admitted the murders.
MS. SMITH: It came -- some of that came
through the State's own witnesses. And -- and the
argument the State made about him being a drug user
versus a drug seller was not the only argument the State
made. The State specifically said look at -- to the
jury, look at what he did on the day of the murders,
look at what he did on Saturday and Sunday to go to his
state of mind. And the State focused on the -- the goal
oriented, the purposeful behavior and the very direct
behavior --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that the
material described by Justice Breyer would have been
excluded by the trial court as irrelevant if it had been
introduced, or cumulative as --
MS. SMITH: I don't think it would have been
excluded. I think it could have been used to attempt to
cross-examine certainly Agent Roby. But Agent Roby's
testimony didn't -- didn't state that Mr. Cone was not a
drug user. Mr. Roby -- Agent Roby's testimony was that
at the time that he observed him, four days after the
murders, he didn't appear to be on -- under the
influence of drugs, and when he saw him eight days after
the murder, he examined his body and there were no
needle marks.
The testimony was very specific as to his
observations on the four-day point and the eight-day
point as to the murders.
Same with Agent Flynn --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think the
prosecutor had an ethical duty to turn over this
material?
MS. SMITH: I think that the material -- if
the material -- if the subject was immaterial --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It's a simple question,
yes or no?
MS. SMITH: I think that as a legal matter
there was no -- no need to turn it over because it was
immaterial.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not my question.
Can you answer my question? Did he have an ethical duty
to turn this material over?
MS. SMITH: I'm unaware of any ethical
requirement that he turn it over, and I don't think
that -- and certainly under Brady if it's not material,
we don't think it was material, then it's certainly not
required as a constitutional matter. And the reason is
not --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You believe that the
materiality judgment is yours to make, the State's to
make as sort of a gate keeping measure? Isn't the
materiality an issue for the fact finder?
MS. SMITH: Well, I think it's -- it's --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You exclude -- do you
believe that you can, in effect, suppress any piece of
evidence on -- on -- on the State's judgment that it
will not prove to be material in the context of the
whole case?
MS. SMITH: I think prosecutors make those
kind of judgment calls all the time.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you think that's a
proper judgment for the prosecution to make?
MS. SMITH: Well, I think that probably a
prudent prosecutor would err on the side of turning over
matters that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And --
MS. SMITH: -- have some relevance.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't -- wouldn't he err
on the side of turning over the matters because Brady
leaves the materiality judgment, like all materiality
judgments, ultimately, to the fact finder?
MS. SMITH: Certainly ultimately it's left
to the fact finder, but the prosecutor is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, initially Brady
leaves the judgment for, furthering Justice Souter's
point, to the attorney for the defense. You're saying
that the prosecutor can preempt the role of the attorney
for the defense in deciding what to offer to the court
as material? And if -- and if -- and if -- even if the
evidence is in a gray area, that's for the defense
attorney to decide under -- under our Brady
jurisprudence, as I understand it. Correct me if that's
wrong.
MS. SMITH: Well, I think -- yes, I think
the defense ultimately would make the decision how to
use the evidence that comes into his possession. But
obviously, the prosecutor has to make an initial
judgment call about whether or not the evidence is going
to be material, given what he knows about -- about the
defense.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the prosecutor's
obligation to make an initial assessment as to whether
the evidence tends to be mitigating evidence or
favorable to the defendant? Isn't that the prosecutor's
judgment?
MS. SMITH: I think that -- that falls
within that -- the prosecutor's judgment. But I think
if we look -- look at the evidence in --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't this evidence clearly
of a mitigating character?
MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: You don't think -- you
don't think it would be favorable to the defendant
getting the evidence that Justice Breyer summarized a
moment ago?
MS. SMITH: No, sir, I do not. There was
already evidence before the jury that the defendant was
a drug addict, that he was a drug user, that he was
changed after Vietnam. This Court's own opinion in 2002
noted that he was a drug addict.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe I'm being -- but
Justice Breyer made the point, and made it, I think very
clearly, that although that evidence was in, the
argument here -- the argument that was made before the
jury in this case is that the witnesses upon whom the
defense was specifically relying, were witnesses whose
account of the defendant's drug use came solely from the
defendant himself.
Given that fact, wouldn't it have been
mitigating evidence to learn that other people, at times
relatively close to the events in question, without
being coached by the defendant, had concluded that he
was a drug user? Wouldn't that have been mitigating
evidence?
MS. SMITH: I don't think that it would have
been material to --
JUSTICE SOUTER: We are not asking about
materiality at this point. We are asking about the
mitigating character of the evidence. Would it have
been favorable to the defendant? Would that have been
its tendency?
MS. SMITH: I think it added no more than --
than what was already before the jury.
JUSTICE SOUTER: That was not my question.
Was it favorable evidence? Did it have a tendency to
favor the defendant?
MS. SMITH: No, not under his theory, and
the reason is --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I will be candid with
you that I simply cannot follow your argument because I
believe you have just made a statement to me that is
utterly irrational.
MS. SMITH: Well, let me explain if I -- if
I may, and the reason I say that it is not mitigating is
because the -- the entire question in the defense and
for mitigation purposes is the defendant's state of mind
at the time of the murder.
There was already evidence that there was --
that he was a drug user. The fact that he was a drug
user doesn't say anything more -- or additional evidence
of drug use says nothing more about his state of mind at
the time of the crime than what was already presented.
The question is not whether he was a drug user. The
record showed it. It came out of the mouths of the
State's own witness.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the
prosecutor who said "baloney." He said the prosecutor
-- the prosecutor says: The defendant tells you he was
a drug user.  Baloney, he was a drug dealer.
The prosecutor deliberately tried to paint
this man as somebody who had a huge quantity of drugs,
which he did, and he was dealing in them. I mean the --
the prosecutor tried to portray a man who was a cold-
blooded killer, who didn't have any blurred vision.
And that line to the jury, "baloney" -- he
says he was a drug user -- that, it seems to me, is
exactly what the prosecutor wanted to do, which is to
tell this jury this guy's a dealer; he's not a drug
abuser.
MS. SMITH: I think that the prosecutor
overstated in that portion of his argument, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: You also had cross-examined
the two expert witnesses in order to show that they
didn't really know that this man was a drug user,
because their only basis for that was he told them. So
as I've read these briefs, I've come away concluding
yours with a strong impression that this was a relevant
issue. That the prosecution did not concede that he was
on drugs at the time of the murder. Indeed, that that
was all that was at issue.
And so I just don't see, like Justice
Souter, how you can say that this wouldn't at least be
useful information if -- even for cross-examination, and
I think more than that since you have three direct
witnesses.
But leaving that aside, there's another part
of this case that equally bothers me. It seems to me
there was a lawyer for the State here that twice told
the courts that this matter had never been raised. Is
that so? Or maybe he said that the courts had decided
it because the State has taken absolutely inconsistent
positions, first saying that the trial courts decided
it, and they did decide it, but by accident. They
thought that paragraph 41 referred to this claim when it
referred to an earlier claim.
So first they tell the courts -- and you
wouldn't know that unless you are pretty familiar
because there were a lot of words written. They tell
the courts: It's been decided, judge. Don't worry.
They decided it: Adequate State ground. And next they
wake up to the fact that it wasn't decided, and then
they announce: Oh, he waived it, despite the fact that
there's a case called Swanson in Tennessee that says
that you can raise a later claim if you have grounds for
not knowing of it in the first place. And he didn't
know of it until 1993.
So I see the State taking opposite
positions, and -- and what seems from the briefs
inconsistent with the State law, and I'm confused. What
is it that happened in this case?
MS. SMITH: Well, I -- I want to answer your
question, and I will answer your question, Your Honor,
if I could just say one thing about the Brady. We don't
dispute that the material in question is relevant to the
defense and is relevant to the sentence.
We dispute that it's material. We don't
think it's material in every court where the district
court and the sixth circuit have found it immaterial.
But on the -- on the -- the -- what has happened in
terms of the procedural defense, we have confessed that
there was an error by the State in the -- in the post-
conviction court.
We agree that Tennessee law does allow -- it
certainly at -- at this time did allow a petitioner to
raise -- to -- to file successive petitions if that
petitioner could establish cause. Now, the prosecutor
in the course of responding to some 80 claims, both
parts and subparts, made a mistake and read paragraph 35
as being similar to -- to a claim that had been raised
on direct appeal and argued that it appeared to be the
same. That was an error.
--
Likewise, the trial court erroneously ruled
that both paragraph 35 and paragraph 41, both Brady
claims, had been previously determined on direct appeal
or post-conviction. That was an error. We have
confessed that in our brief and -- and do at this point.
Now, in the appeal the petitioner doesn't
again raise the Brady claim. In his principal brief he
never mentions the Brady claim. He never even reaches
JUSTICE ALITO: If we read the -- can I ask
you this: If we read the decision of the Court of
Criminal Appeals as having ratified the -- the district
court's -- the -- the lower court's treatment of the
procedural default issues, having rejected it on the
ground that it was previously decided, that would be an
instance in which a State court applied a procedural
default rule based on an undisputed error of fact.
In that situation, would it not -- wouldn't
it be clear that there was not an adequate, independent
State ground for the decision; and, therefore, no
procedural default? And if we were to find that,
wouldn't the appropriate step be on this very factual
Brady issue to send it back to the lower federal courts?
MS. SMITH: In answer to your first
question, yes, we don't disagree with the proposition
that if a trial -- that if a State court refuses to
consider a claim on the basis that that claim has been
determined previously, that that would not be an
adequate basis for a procedural default in Federal
Court.
But we don't -- I don't think that this case
presents that scenario, and every court that has looked
at the Court of Criminal Appeals's decision has read
that decision as applying a waiver. The District Court
read that decision as applying a waiver. If you look at
-- at page 112-A of the petition appendix, not only does
the District Court read it as a waiver, but the
Petitioner read it as a applying a waiver. Because as
you note in that first sentence, as to the Brady claim
to the district court, Cone also attempts to argue that
those claims were improperly held waived by the court.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, "waiver," my
goodness. First, I don't think it's impossible to say
"waiver" since he wrote the words in paragraph 41 that
make absolutely clear that they aren't waiving it. He
is raising it.
Then, aside from that, the paragraph of the
district -- of the court of appeals's opinion says they
were already decided or waived. So it's ambiguous, at
best, for you.
So let's go back and see what the State
district court held, and I think that the State district
court held that it had been decided, not that it had
been waived. Am I right?
MS. SMITH: The trial court --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MS. SMITH: -- held that.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So there the cases
in this Court would say if a State appeals court writes
a matter -- something -- a sentence that is ambiguous so
you don't know whether it was decided: For example,
they mean it was waived or mean that it was decided,
then the next best thing to do, which makes sense, is
look to the lower court to see what they actually did.
So we follow that rule, and we get to
exactly what justice Alito said: That what they did was
they were holding that this has already been decided.
MS. SMITH: I think that rule holds if the
petitioner has made the argument to the appellate court.
Here the Petitioner didn't make the argument to the
appellate court.
JUSTICE BREYER: Don't you think at this
point the Petitioner is saying in -- in his briefs:
I've been getting the runaround. First, they tell me
it's one thing; then they tell me another. All I can
tell you is this: No one has ever passed on the merits
of this Brady claim, which is a substantial claim.
MS. SMITH: Well, I --
JUSTICE BREYER: So you choose the
procedures, but be sure that that's the outcome.
MS. SMITH: Well, first of all, Your Honor,
I don't think the Petitioner has been getting the
runaround. The Petitioner has always throughout this
litigation proceeded on the premise that the CCA -- the
Court of Criminal Appeals's decision in Tennessee was
based on a waiver. All of his briefs in the lower court
and in the -- the sixth circuit reflect that.
The District Court proceeded as if that
ruling was a waiver. The sixth circuit in its 2001
decision, if you look at page 62-A and 62 -- 63-A at the
bottom, the -- the sixth circuit specifically said the
Tennessee waiver rule is plainly applicable to the Brady
claim. And the Tennessee courts explicitly relied on
the waiver rule.
It wasn't until the 2007 opinion that the --
the sixth circuit even discussed this notion of previous
determination, and only then in response to what I think
was a red herring injected by the dissenting opinion
that somehow the -- the Court of Criminal Appeals's
decision stood for something different than what the
parties and the courts had been reading it all along.
The Court of Criminal Appeals --
JUSTICE BREYER: Could the explanation of
this language in the opinion be due to the fact that the
State first argued that it had already been decided;
then in later courts the State changed its theory and
announced that it had been waived?
MS. SMITH: The State --
JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that why they're
writing about waiver?
MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. The State has
consistently maintained throughout the habeas that the
-- that the Brady claim was either defaulted or waived.
In the answer to the petition, the State presented the
very argument that they're presenting today, that the
Court of Criminal Appeals relied on a waiver. In the --
in the brief to the Sixth Circuit --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Spell out the waiver in
light of what he said. The first time he learns that
these -- cases, other cases cited and he has access to
the district attorney's file, he then files a habeas,
State habeas petition in which he said that the facts on
which his Brady claim rests have been revealed through
disclosure of the State's files which occurred after the
first conviction proceeding. Those words are in the
affidavit -- right -- that came with the second
petition. So how could he possibly have waived this
when he has explained it wasn't available to him?
MS. SMITH: Well, I think to understand how
this -- how this could happen, the bottom line is that
he failed to demonstrate to the State courts why he
should -- he was properly before the court to begin
with; and when you -- when you raise a claim -- he
buried his claim among a hundred other parts and
subparts. If --if he had a legitimate claim, he
certainly didn't highlight it as such, and then he -- he
buried even further his explanation for a waiver in a
-page affidavit filed six days before the State
court's ruling in this case.
It was the first time in the entire case
that he mentioned anything at all about access to the
prosecutor's files. Then when he got an adverse
judgment in the trial court he never even made the
argument in the Court of Criminal Appeals. He took a
completely different theory about waiver, said that
waiver was personal, and should be -- should be judged
on a subjective standard rather than objective -- never
mentioned to the Court of Criminal Appeals any argument
whatsoever about access to the prosecutor's files.
It was on the basis of that argument that
the Court of Criminal Appeals held that the Petitioner
had failed to rebut the presumption of waiver as a
matter of law as to all claims that had not been
previously determined.
So that holding is an overarching holding,
it applies to every claim that was raised in the first
term and in the successive habeas position, and we think
justified the district -- it certainly was the basis of
the district court's default and as well, in 2001 was
the basis of the Sixth Circuit's decision.
Now, regarding the 2007 decision, we concede
that that decision could be read as presenting the
question 1, where this Court relies on a finding of
previous determination, but we don't think that's what
the court did in 2007. In 2007 the court specifically
ruled that it was not revisiting the Brady claim. That
was a decision based on law of the case principles, and
to the extent that it discussed previous determination,
we don't think it in any way intended to modify its
earlier holding.
In 2001 the Sixth Circuit clearly relied on
the waiver bar, and that's very evident on pages 62 and
a in the petition appendix, and that's the basis of
the waiver. So we don't even think that the -- that the
situation in question 1 is even presented, although
if -- to answer a question, in response to Justice
Alito's question, I think it would be -- would be an
absurd result that something that has been previously
determined is defaulted, but that's not the situation
here. The record shows it's not previously determined.
The Petitioner has never argued that it's previously
determined, and no court until this point has ever even
read the Court of Criminal Appeals decision as making a
previous determination finding. Everyone has accepted
the fact that that holding was a waiver holding.
So on that -- that's the basis of the
default, and the reason that he has defaulted is that he
failed to make that argument when he had -- when he the
opportunity to make it. He could have made it, and he
didn't make it. He buried all his good arguments, even
on his waiver argument, he was making inconsistent
arguments. On the one hand, he was saying the claim was
novel, the claim that my post-conviction counsel didn't
discuss it with me. On the other hand, he says that I'm
just now finding out about it. Those are completely
inconsistent theories, and the theory that he actually
presented in the Court of Criminal Appeals bears no
resemblance to the argument that he is making now or
that he made in the district court.
But all of this aside, it really is -- is
beside the point because at the end of the day, the
district court very clearly addressed -- and
specifically, not just in passing, but specifically at
various points in its -- in its opinion, the materiality
of each and every item of evidence.
He went through in detail a discussion of
the police teletypes, stating that -- that the jury
already was aware that he was a drug user. It really
wasn't any question whether he was a drug user; the
evidence clearly showed that he was. The question was
what was his State of mind at the time evidence was what
was his state of mind at the time of the murders.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you say to
the argument on the other side, that these various items
of -- of Brady material were averted to and were
discussed on a purely isolated basis; they were not
discussed in terms of their cumulative effect, which
Kyles v Whitley says is the standard. What's your
response to that?
MS. SMITH: Well, I think if you look at the
-- at the district court's opinion, I could that
argument could be made based upon the way the district
court treated the items. The district court certainly
did look at them in categories and separated them; but I
think if you look at the Sixth Circuit's opinion,
certainly in 2007 where the court -- the court looked at
it in more detail, I think that it is clear that the
court cumulated the items and said as a whole that the
Brady materials don't undermine -- do not undermine
confidence in the verdict. So I disagree that -- that
the Sixth Circuit treated them incorrectly, and -- and I
would note --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do you agree the
prosecutor was arguing, when he said that he's a drug
dealer, that he was not a drug user? Was it -- was it
conceded that he was a drug user? I suspect it was not.
I said earlier it was, and it seems that it
was not, because he introduced one witness to say that
there were no -- no needle marks on his body, which
would suggest that he's trying to make the point to the
jury that this person doesn't even use drugs.
MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I -- I think I've
noted earlier, I think that the prosecutor overstated
his case on that point, no question about it; but I
think there was ample evidence in the record indicating
that he was a drug user. This Court even noted that,
even noted there was proof of the fact that he was a
drug addict, that he was a drug user, that the evidence
was strong that he was -- that he was under the
influence of an amphetamine psychosis. There were two
experts that testified to that. On the other hand,
there were two experts for the State that said that that
-- that defense couldn't be supported.
So the question of whether he was a drug
user or not a drug user was really beside the point. I
think the prosecutor eventually got around to that in
his argument. When you look at the argument of the
whole, the bottom line of the argument was, and we
quoted it in our brief, "look at what he did, look at
his actions around this murder, and let that go to his
state of mind," because that was the best evidence. Not
only is that -- he said, he specifically said he went
into this individual's home with the purpose of getting
fed, getting cleaned up and getting out of town, and
when the Todds ceased to cooperate with him, he had to
control them physically. That's code I suppose for
beating them to death because that's exactly what he
did.
He explained what he did and why he did it.
His actions are very calculated from -- from beginning
to end. So whether he used drugs or didn't use drugs,
the question is what was going on at the time of this
murder, and by his own admission the reason that the
Todds are -- are not with us today is because they
ceased to cooperate; they became frightened; and he had
to control them physically. I think that's the best
evidence of his state of mind at the time. Those are
words out of his own mouth, and I think that that
certainly supports the finding of both the district
court and the Sixth Circuit on materiality.
I agree with the Chief Justice's assessment;
we do not think that the Brady claim is fairly included
within the question. The merits issue is not a
predicate to the default question. I certainly
understand Petitioner's dilemma in this case, but I
think faced with that dilemma, he should have squarely
presented that question among the questions presented
and not dropped it in a footnote in argument 2. We
don't think it's fairly presented; but -- but in any
event, it certainly justifies affirmance of the judgment
or at a minimum the dismissal of the appeal.
And for all these reasons, if there are no
further questions, we ask this Court to affirm the
judgment of the district court -- of the Sixth Circuit.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's outside the record
and not really relevant to the case. Has he been on
death row since 1984 or so? And if so, is that solitary
confinement? Is he not allowed -- if you know?
MS. SMITH: I don't know. I'm not aware
that he's in any sort of heightened level of security.
I would assume he's just at a standard level.  I don't
know his security level, but he has been on death row
for the entire period, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Goldstein, you have three minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice.
Justice Kennedy, he has been on death row;
he is not in solitary confinement.
Here's the dilemma I think about how the
Court needs to dispose of the case. On the one hand, we
have the State, which is unapologetic about having
suppressed a whole bunch of evidence and about having
misstated the procedural history to the State court and
then to the Sixth Circuit. On the other hand, the
Court's business is usually not to get into the weeds,
things like fact-bound Brady claims, and I think that
the Court can accommodate both the concern of the signal
that it would send in affirming the judgment in this
case and also the -- the bad precedent it might set by
getting into the Johnson pitfalls of this witness
statement and that witness statement, by resolving the
case as follows:
On page 22 and 24a of the petition appendix,
the court of appeals says the claim was procedurally
defaulted because it was previously determined. That's
wrong. That is the argument that was passed upon by the
court of appeals, and that should be reversed on
procedural grounds.
On the Brady claim, it seems to me that the
court of appeals, when it did discuss the claim, made a
couple of big mistakes the Court could identify and send
the case back. The first is, when it talked about the
merits, it said we don't think this evidence would have
mattered because there was a lot of evidence at trial
that he was a drug user. But as has been discussed, I
think in detail, the court of appeals, because its
assessment was kind of passing here, misunderstood that
when the experts said that, when the prosecutor turned
around and completely discredited that. And so I think
that colors the Sixth Circuit's assessment incorrectly.
The second is the Kyles point, and the third
is the possibility that we're entitled to an evidentiary
hearing.
And so I think an opinion of this Court that
simply dealt with the undefended procedural default
ruling and then went to the merits and only made those
three points and then left it to the lower courts to
resolve the Brady claim ultimately would balance the
concern about the Court's institutional interests in not
sending a signal of affirming this judgment in light of
what the State has done here and not getting into the
weeds of the claim.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there anything in
the court of appeals' treatment of the Brady claim on
the merits that suggests it also treated them separately
in the different silos, as you put it?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. We
point out that the court of appeals twice said, "We
consider the four different categories of Brady evidence
separately." And then when it did discuss them -- it's
very hard to tell, its discussion is so passing here --
but it does go through this kind of evidence, say, the
FBI files or the police teletypes from Agent Roby, and
it says that wouldn't have been persuasive, and then it
turns to the witness statements. But I would also say
that its overarching point --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where do they say
that they're only considering the categories separately?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: On page 57a. "We take" --
"We will take up each category of documents separately
and discuss whether they are" --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the 2001
opinion. Do they do that in the 2007 opinion?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: No. The -- in the 2007
opinion, that discussion happens at 25a, and here is
their explanation. It goes to my first point. And they
do sort of then turn around and treat them more
generally. "It would not have been news to the jurors
that Cone was a drug user. They had already heard
substantial direct evidence that he was a drug user,
including the opinion of the two expert witnesses,
Cone's mother, the drugs found in Cone's car, and
photographic evidence." And that's our point, that that
was discredited because it came out of his mouth.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What was the photographic
evidence?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: There was one photo. It
actually points in the opposite direction. The State
cites it in its merit brief. They have a picture of
Cone as not having any needle marks, to your point,
Justice Scalia, that they tried to prove he wasn't a
drug user at all.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
I'm sorry, Mr. Goldstein, one moment.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did you raise --
cite Kyles in your petition for cert?
MR. GOLDSTEIN: I can tell that you quickly,
Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I see it. Yes.
Pages 30 and 32. Okay.
MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
