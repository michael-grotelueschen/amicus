CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
now in No. 03-1488, Ulysses Tory v. Johnnie L. Cochran.
Mr. Chemerinsky.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Good morning. Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
The injunction in this case violates the most
basic principles of the First Amendment. It's a prior
restraint. It's a content-based restriction on speech.
It's vastly overbroad. It even restricts the speech of
those who are not a party to the lawsuit, such as
Petitioner Ruth Craft.
The injunction in this case is inconsistent with
this country's unique and profound commitment that speech
by public officials and public figures be open, robust,
and uninhibited.
One way in which the injunction is clearly
unconstitutional is in restricting the speech of those who
are not a party to the lawsuit. For example, Ruth Craft
is expressly restrained from ever speaking again about
Johnnie Cochran even though she was never named as a party
to the lawsuit. And, in fact, Cochran's attorney admitted
at the beginning of trial, she wasn't a part of the
lawsuit.
JUSTICE SOUTER: How about you? You're in
trouble too, aren't you?
(Laughter.)
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, I am, Your Honor. This
injunction is so broad that if I talk about Johnnie
Cochran or this case on the sidewalk in front of this
Court or pass out copies of the brief or speak to any
reporter, I am violating the terms of the injunction and I
could be held in contempt of court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Chemerinsky, you speak
about the injunction, and the injunction has three parts.
I thought that you were not challenging -- at least the
question presented doesn't suggest you're challenging --
the first one that concerns distance, the 300 yard from
Cochran or his place of business, and the third one, which
is an anti-harassment provision. Do I understand
correctly that it is only the second one that you're
challenging?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. The question
presented is that the injunction is unconstitutional.
One of the reasons why the injunction is
unconstitutional is that it's based on speech that's
protected by the First Amendment. All of the statements
that were uttered by Mr. Tory are opinion protected by the
First Amendment. There is not the requisite actual
malice. And so it's our position that the injunction
itself is unconstitutional.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your question is
preventing all future speech about an admitted public
figure, and the first and third provisions of this
injunction do not prohibit all future speech.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, that's
correct. It's our position, though, that the injunction
is based on speech that's protected by the First
Amendment, and we believe that the question presented is
that the injunction is impermissible in its restriction of
speech.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But that isn't what you've
said in the question presented. Why shouldn't we be
limited to answering the question presented? And that
would leave the other parts there.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, of course, you're
limited to the question presented. Our position, though,
is that the injunction in its restriction of speech is
unconstitutional. And one of the reasons why the
injunction is unconstitutional is that all of the speech
that occurred in this case is speech that's protected by
the First Amendment.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but you understand
Justice Ginsburg's question surely, and I would imagine
that even if you prevail, nothing we would order would
affect the first and third parts.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, Your Honor, certainly we
believe that the injunction is most clearly
unconstitutional in its overbreadth.
We believe also and separately the injunction is
unconstitutional because injunctions are not a permissible
remedy in a defamation case, especially concerning public
officials and public figures.
But it's also our position that the injunction
is based on speech that's protected by the First
Amendment, and thus, the injunction violates the First
Amendment.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that doesn't --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Chemerinsky, is it true
that your client intends to go on defaming Mr. Cochran?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. We don't
believe our client has ever defamed Mr. Cochran. We
believe that all of his speech is just opinion.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does he intend to continue
making the same comments that he made before?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: His exact words were that
perhaps he would continue to express his view that Mr.
Cochran owes him money.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. Now, let me ask
you this. Under your theory, if -- if the defendant is
judgment-proof, does respondent have any remedy at all if
the statements are defamatory?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What is it?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: There is, of course, a remedy.
Since we're dealing here with a public figure, there is
the remedy of expressing views which this Court has said
in Gertz v. Welch is available to a public figure. There
is a damage judgment that's available. Certainly, Your
Honor, there can't be a different rule --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But if -- if the defendant is
judgment-proof, what good does that do?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, there is a damage
judgment that forever would be available against the
person. And it cannot be, Your Honor, that those who are
poor will have injunctions --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, your -- your
answer should be to Justice O'Connor there is no effective
legal remedy under your theory of the case.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, I disagree
with that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you -- you say he has
the remedy of -- of counter-speech. We're talking --
that's really that doesn't answer the question. The
question is, is there anything he can get from the courts
other than a damage remedy, and your answer I think is no.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: That's correct, Your Honor.
From the courts, he can get a damage remedy but I don't
accept that a damage remedy is inadequate just because a
person may be poor. The damage remedy will be that they'd
be collected for the person who gets assets in the future.
Also, as I was saying to Justice O'Connor, it
can't be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it -- it seems to me
that that really avoids the problem -- the problem.
So suppose we disagree with you about that.
Then it's true that there is no -- there is no legal
remedy that he can get.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: But then, Justice Kennedy, it
can't be the rule that poor people have their speech
enjoined, but those with assets can continue to speak in
the future.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it also can't be the rule
that poor people can defame ad libitum and -- and people
who have money cannot. I mean, that's -- that's not a
fair rule either.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, but that's why
there would be, of course, the ability of a court to issue
a damage judgment. There are many instances in which
damage judgments can't be collected.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's worthless against a --
against a person who has no assets.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: But that's true everywhere in
the legal system, Your Honor.
And I would also argue here that none of Mr.
Tory's statements were defamatory. I would point --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now that's another one that
is in your brief. You say that these were statements of
opinion not fact. But that surely is not presented in
your question. You -- you don't -- there were findings
made that these statements were defamatory, and your
question presented does not seem to me to encompass at
all the question whether these statements were defamatory.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: I would disagree, Your Honor.
The question presented is whether this injunction, that
forever stops speech, violates the First Amendment. One
reason why --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not this injunction.
The question presented is whether a permanent injunction
as a remedy in a defamation -- in a defamation action,
preventing all future speech about an admitted public
figure, violates the First Amendment. There's no
suggestion in that that you claim that in this particular
case there was no defamation. I -- I just don't think
it's fairly included within the question.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, what I am saying
is that the question presented does ask whether this
injunction, which permanently restricts speech --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't. It says
whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation
action preventing all future speech about an admitted
public figure violates the First Amendment.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: We would argue --
JUSTICE SCALIA: There's nothing about this
particular injunction which is based upon speech that is
not defamation. There's nothing in there about that.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, our position is
that question asks whether an injunction violates the
First Amendment, and certainly it is about this case. And
our position is that all of the speech that was expressed
in this case is opinion. And it's important --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if that's
so --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, there really --
there are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer
is a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell
us that that's not defamatory, I mean, I -- I think we
should just proceed on -- on some other basis for this
argument. We have other questions to discuss.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Sure. But, Your Honor, I want
to just respond to that. The exact statement there was --
and I'll quote it for you and it is on page 54 of the
joint appendix. Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief.
Can a lawyer go to heaven? Luke 11:46. Your Honor, this
Court has said, for example, in Greenbelt Cooperative that
charging somebody with blackmail is expressing opinion.
In Letter Carriers v. Austin this Court said calling
somebody a traitor is opinion.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. That -- that --
what you've quoted many -- much of this I wouldn't repeat
in polite company. You've reported one of the most mild,
and in fact there are two findings. One, this is not just
defamation. It was an action for defamation, as well as a
tort of invasion of privacy. And there is a finding,
first, that this was done intentionally to create a
negatively charged and ominous environment, and this is
not a matter of speech-related issues. It is simply the
use of false and defamatory and privacy-invading
communications, or worse, or attempt to improperly coerce
payment of money in tribute for -- for desisting from that
type of activity. All right. Now, those are the
findings against you.
So suppose I agreed with you hypothetically that
that, with all these findings, is nonetheless protected by
the First Amendment. All right? Now, suppose, in other
words, you convince me of that. Now, I want to know how
to write my opinion on that assumption to protect what I
was worried about yesterday, that a woman who has a
boyfriend or a husband is being continuously harassed in
-- with methods similar to this one. See, it's easy to
transpose those two cases which are both on my mind.
And I want to know if in your opinion that these
restraining orders, which try to prevent this kind of
thing, among others, are unconstitutional, if there's a
way of distinguishing them, if you could possibly win on
what theory. And what I'm trying to get you to do is to
say is it absolute. Are there limits? If so, what?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: I would suggest three
different ways in which you could write the opinion that
distinguished the case.
The first is that this injunction is vastly
overbroad, that even if there can be an injunction to say
that Ulysses Tory and Ruth Craft can never again say
anything about Johnnie Cochran in any public forum, that I
can never speak about Johnnie Cochran would violate the
First Amendment.
A second way of distinguishing is that
defamation is different, that when the First Amendment was
adopted, the clear history was that above all it was to
prevent prior restraints, and that injunctions were not
permitted in defamation actions. That's quite different
than a harassment action.
And third, as I've argued, what makes this
different is the basis for this injunction is speech
protected by the First Amendment.
With regard to the findings that you referred
to, you mentioned two.
The first is invasion of privacy. Your Honor,
the only privacy claim in this case was false light
invasion of privacy. California law is clear. When there
is a defamation action and a false light claim, the false
light claim is automatically dismissed as duplicative when
it's based on the same fact.
The second basis you pointed --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Chemerinsky, this
case comes up to us from a California appellate court.
Surely they know California law better than we do.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, but they did
not base their decision on the privacy claim because
California law is clear that when it's false light
invasion of privacy brought together with a defamation
action, the false light claim is dismissed. That's a
California case, Couch v. San Jose Unified School
District.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, we're not going
to debate among ourselves over what California law is.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. All I'm
saying is it's important to be clear about what the
privacy claim is. As I was saying to Justice Breyer,
there may be privacy claims that give rise to injunctions.
Harassment claims may give rise to injunctions, but not
the privacy claim in this case which was just about false
light, which even the California Court of Appeal admitted
is treated together with defamation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose this picketing had
taken place in front of his house, every day in front of
his house.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, under Frisby v.
Schultz, that would be a different situation. Under
Frisby v. Schultz, this Court said --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well -- well, then
this -- this argument you're making, oh, never, never, the
sky is falling and so forth, I -- I think we have to be
more precise here. I think if it were in front of his
house, it would be different.
If he had alleged $10 worth of monetary damages,
it would be disparaging the quality of his services, which
would be a trade libel, and the Restatement at least -- I
don't know California law -- says that you -- would you
agree that you can enjoin a trade libel --
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that disparages quality of
goods to the serious injury of a -- of a business?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Actually, Your Honor, the vast
majority of cases have held that you cannot have an
injunction for product defamation. And so I think while
that's a different and more difficult question, most
courts have said no even there.
And Your Honor, I'm not saying there can never
be injunctions. But I am saying that this Court has said
there's a very strong and heavy presumption against
injunctions, and that never, not once in the 214-year
history of the First Amendment, has this Court ever upheld
an injunction as a remedy in a defamation action.
And, Your Honor --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if -- if this under --
the underlying claim seems to be that Mr. Cochran is
essentially being blackmailed; that is, this -- this --
your client wants tribute to go away. And you say, yes,
but it's defamation. It's a defamation action.
Therefore, damages is the only remedy.
Is there nothing that one can do to stop another
from engaging in blackmail?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, there is. If
this was blackmail or extortion, Johnnie Cochran could
have filed a criminal complaint with the police. He could
have civilly sued for blackmail or extortion. But, Your
Honor, this wasn't extortion.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What kind of a jurisprudence
is it that a person can go to jail but that he's freed
from an injunction? I mean, why -- why do we do this?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: But Your Honor, that's
because this Court has said that injunctions of speech are
even worse than criminal penalties. I would refer this
Court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but why -- is that true
in every case? I mean, take the timid person who's not
sure -- I know the law doesn't protect the timid person in
the first area, but let's -- let's assume the timid person
is not sure. So he wants -- he wants to get an equitable
ruling first, declaratory judgment. He -- and he would
take an injunction. That's certainly much easier than
going to jail.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, I'd remind
you of this Court's language in the Vance v. Universal
Amusement where the Court said presumption against prior
restraints is heavier and the degree of protection broader
than against limits on criminal penalties.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know, but I'm asking you why
that -- why that should be. If -- if you asked a person
not familiar with our jurisprudence, which is worse,
having an injunction that you can argue about or going to
jail, I -- I think they would say that going to jail is
worse.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, in terms of
the First Amendment, there are reasons why an injunction
has always been regarded as worse.
JUSTICE BREYER: Always? Do you want to apply
that to an harassment action too against a woman who has
the restraining order? No restraining orders in divorce
cases in case they're against speech because even if
violence is threatened, even if -- et cetera. I mean, how
-- how far do you want to push that principle?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, I don't want to
push the principle at all to harassment. I believe that
injunctions are completely appropriate in harassment
actions. I think it is quite important to note that the
California harassment statute expressly excludes speech
which is protected by the First Amendment as being a basis
for harassment.
The history of the First Amendment is different.
To go back to Justice Kennedy's question, it's always been
thought that an injunction strikes at the very heart of
the First Amendment because, as Justice Scalia pointed
out --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't we say that speech
that is -- is being used for extortion is different, just
as speech which is being used for harassment is different?
And just as you can get an injunction for the latter, you
ought to be able to get an injunction for the former. Not
all speech, but only when speech is being used to -- to
extort money.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, there can be
an injunction for extortion, but this was not extortion.
There was never the criminal complaint. There was never
the civil action. And it didn't meet the requirements for
extortion. Your Honor, California law, Penal Code section
8, defines extortion as, quote, the obtaining of
property from another with his consent induced by a
wrongful use of force or fear. There wasn't the wrongful
use of force or fear.
Now, it may be that Ulysses Tory was speaking --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Here I think there was -- why
isn't there a use of fear when, you know, you're afraid of
this person destroying your business by calling you a liar
and a cheat? Wasn't Mr. Cochran afraid of that -- of that
happening?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, this Court is
required to do an independent review of the record under
Bose v. Consumers Union. There's no indication that Mr.
Cochran suffered that fear from Mr. Tory being outside.
It's true that Mr. Tory may have believed that he was owed
money by Johnnie Cochran and was also trying to encourage
Mr. Cochran to pay. But this Court has said in cases like
NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware speech does not lose its
protective character simply because it may embarrass
others or coerce them into action.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Chemerinsky, the district
-- I mean, the trial court made certain findings and I'm
looking at page 42 of the joint appendix. The first is
that these statements were actually made for the purpose
of inducing Cochran to pay Tory amounts of money which
Tory was not entitled. That's one finding. And then
finding 24, despite repeated requests, Tory has refused to
cease picketing unless he was paid money -- a monetary
settlement by Cochran. And then 27 that says this is
simply use of false and privacy-invading communications to
coerce or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in
tribute for desisting from that type of activity. And
those sound like findings.
It's true that the label of extortion has been
put on it, but it certainly does sound like the -- that
the purpose of the speech was to extract money not owed.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, since this is
a defamation action, not an extortion action, the rules
under the First Amendment for defamation have to apply.
Under the rules of the First Amendment for defamation,
injunctions are not available to public officials or
public figures.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so this finding -- the
court shouldn't have made these findings? It was
irrelevant?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, Your Honor, I believe
that the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there an objection to the
testimony that established this?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Tory,
who was appearing pro se in the trial court, from the very
outset objected that he was being held liable for speech
protected by the First Amendment.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it seems to me -- and I
think what bothers me is -- is what bothers Justice
Kennedy. It seems to me that the argument you just made
is an argument that given the pleadings in this case, the
findings that Justice Ginsburg just quoted really were
irrelevant findings, that they should not have gotten --
that the court should not have gotten into extortion and
so on and should not have provided a remedy for extortion,
quite apart from the fact of whether it's an appropriate
remedy, constitutional or otherwise. And that, it seems
to me, is -- is something that we -- we are not here to
touch. That's a question of California law.
What we are here to touch is, number one,
whether the injunction is overbroad with respect to pure
speech, and maybe we are here -- that we have a question
about the -- the breadth of the case we took. But maybe
we are here to determine whether there can be an
injunction against blackmail or harassing activities.
But I -- I think we're not here to decide
whether California could have gotten to the question of
blackmail, harassment, and injunction for that. Do you
agree with that?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. I certainly
agree with the first point. One issue before this Court
is whether this injunction is overbroad, and it clearly is
in terms of the breadth of speech that's regulated and
whose regulated.
But as to the second point that you make, this
is a defamation action, and thus the issue before this
Court, clearly presented in the question presented, is
whether a permanent injunction can be issued in a
defamation case remedy when the plaintiff is a public
figure.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it can certainly -- the
-- the issue is certainly before us as to whether such an
injunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure
and simple. But the findings that Justice Ginsburg has --
has read and part of the order in question here seems to
go beyond pure defamation. It goes to the kind of
demonstrative activity which plausibly is found to have
been in aid of extortion. And that, it seems to me, is an
entirely different question.
We may -- I'm not saying we will, but we may
agree with you that it's overbroad. We may agree with you
that as to pure speech, you can't enjoin it. But that
doesn't necessarily mean that every part of this
injunction is wrong, and it seems to me it is irrelevant
as to whether the -- the State of -- the courts of
California should have reached extortion.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: I would disagree in this way,
Your Honor. Bose v. Consumers Union makes clear that when
it is a defamation action, this Court and every appellate
court has to do an independent review of the record.
JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to the defamation,
pure and simple. I agree with you. We -- there is a
heightened standard of review, but I don't think that
addresses one way or the other what the standard should be
when an action in the State courts has been treated as an
action both for defamation and for extortion or
harassment.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, it was not
treated here as an action for extortion or harassment --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. Mr. Chemerinsky,
let me put the question this way. Suppose a State does
not have a civil action for extortion. It provides
criminal remedies but no civil action for extortion. Why
does the Constitution not permit us to treat, in that
State at least, a civil action for defamation which has
within it elements of distortion differently from pure
defamation?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, I would say the
history of the First Amendment is different. A State can
create a civil action then for extortion at the urging of
this Court, but if you open the door to injunctions in
defamation cases, then there's the possibility that in any
defamation case, somebody might plead something about
extortion, and injunctions will not be rare but will be
the norm.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this -- may I ask
this question? Supposing the only thing he did was to
carry a sign that said Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a
thief, and the trial judge finds that is false, and he's
carrying it in a sign, could the trial judge enjoin him
from carrying that sign in front of Johnnie Cochran's
office?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, because the
law is clear that injunctions are not a permissible remedy
in defamation cases.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What's the best authority you
have for that proposition?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Near v. Minnesota would be the
best authority where this Court said clearly that
injunctive relief should not be awarded in a defamation
case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Add to Justice Stevens' -- add
to Justice Stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he's
losing some clients.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, even -- yes,
Your Honor. But I don't think that changes the
hypothetical in terms of enjoining the defamatory speech.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Would you add too that
he's judgment-proof?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, again, as I said to
Justice O'Connor, I don't think it can matter whether he's
judgment-proof because we can't have a different rule that
we allow poor people's speech to enjoin and not wealthy
people.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying -- you're saying
that a State cannot constitutionally prohibit someone from
making false statements in front of the business that
causes the business to lose money.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, Your Honor, there are
other causes of action that may allow that. If it could
be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So I'm -- my question is, is
this constitutional to prohibit this conduct?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Not in a defamation action,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's not the question.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But what is your authority for
that proposition?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, I would say that the
authority comes from the fact that never in 214 years has
this Court ever upheld an injunction in a defamation case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Have we ever set aside an
injunction that did that?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, not under those facts.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Have we done it either way?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: No. That's correct, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Have we ever -- have we ever
considered a case where there's a strong element of
extortion involved?
MR. CHEMERINSKY: I would say yes, extortion for
Austin v. Keith. There was speech to pressure, and yet
this Court said even though the speech was to pressure,
it's still protected by the First Amendment.
I'd like to save the rest of the time for
rebuttal, if that's permissible.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.
Chemerinsky.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Cole, we'll hear
from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN B. COLE
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may
it please the Court:
For years, Mr. Tory has relentlessly targeted
Johnnie Cochran with a pattern of defamatory speech in a
public forum for purpose of causing Mr. Cochran to pay Mr.
Tory money in tribute for ceasing from this unprotected
activity. He admitted at trial he intended to engage in
this conduct. He was doing it just so he could be paid
money, and when asked if he would continue to do so, he
stated he would.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you defend
the injunction in its entirety?
MR. COLE: Yes --
JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, the -- the --
Mr. Chemerinsky didn't have too much chance to -- to get
very far into it, but one of his points was that there was
-- quite apart from any injunction against picketing,
harassment, et cetera, there was an injunction simply
against speech on a given subject directed to a lot of
people with no limit of time. With respect to that last
aspect, do you defend the injunction?
MR. COLE: Yes. First of all, I don't believe
it was directed to a lot of people. As this --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it was directed, number
one, to a named person who was not a party to the case,
and it was directed to agents and employees of -- of the
named party. So, I -- I assume that Mr. Cochran probably
has a fair number of agents and employees, so it does seem
like a large number of people.
MR. COLE: I believe this Court said in Madsen
that that would raise an abstract controversy that Mr.
Tory doesn't have standing to attack the injunction for
other persons who are not before the court. No aider or
abetter has ever been served with this injunction. Ms.
Craft has never been served with this injunction. Only
Mr. Tory. So I don't believe --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me ask you a law
school question. In -- given the injunction on its face,
with that breadth, is that injunction defensible with
respect not to picketing, not to harassment, simply to
speech in a public place?
MR. COLE: I defend the injunction, and
respondent defends the injunction on the ground that it is
conduct that was being enjoined --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I asked you --
MR. COLE: -- from the use of unprotected
speech.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- to exclude the -- the issue
of conduct. I said forget the injunction for a moment
with respect to picketing, with respect to harassment, and
we'll say with respect to blackmail, since that has come
up. Forget that. Simply take the portion of the
injunction that enjoins speech by these people,
associates, agents, et cetera. On the subject matter of
the injunction for all time, do you defend that
injunction?
MR. COLE: Yes, we defend the injunction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's take specifically the
words of the injunction. It's against orally uttering
statements about Cochran, just orally uttering statements
about Cochran.
MR. COLE: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say that someone can be
enjoined --
MR. COLE: Based upon the unique facts of this
case, Justice Ginsburg, I say somebody can be enjoined. I
don't say that in the abstract.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you can't square that
with the Near case at all. I -- I mean, the -- the
injunction on its face in part 2 has the appearance of
being overly broad.
MR. COLE: But in Near, they set forth certain
factors, and those factors included that it was not a
private redress of private wrongs. The information was of
legitimate public concern. Neither of those elements are
present in this action.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know that.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You don't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know what future
speech is going to be. His future thing may be, you know,
Johnnie Cochran shouldn't be elected mayor of San
Francisco. That would be a -- a question of public
concern.
MR. COLE: But, Justice Scalia, what I'm relying
on is the fact that he has engaged in 3 years in a pattern
of continuing, repetitive conduct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what -- what you're
saying is that an -- an injunction can be overbroad based
on past wrongful conduct. And there is simply no
authority for that proposition.
MR. COLE: I'm not suggesting that this
injunction is necessarily overboard based upon that
proposition because I believe there are --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we have just pointed out
that it -- that it -- it prohibits lawful, harmless,
truthful speech.
MR. COLE: I disagree with that, Justice
Kennedy.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it does on its face. I
mean, it is clearly overbroad. Now, what should we do
about that?
MR. COLE: Well, if you're asking me, based upon
the breadth of the injunction, what I -- if -- if there
was -- are you asking me what I would do to modify the
injunction? You could merely strike -- you could leave
intact paragraph 2 and you could strike simply subsections
(ii) and (iii) as being unconstitutionally overbroad.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, let -- let me ask you
about that. 	 Let's -- let's assume, for the moment, that a
majority of the Court would find that some of these
provisions are overly broad. Is there any authority that
tells us what to do next? This is not like a statute
where we have to save the statute. Do we have any
obligation to save the injunction? Send it back and let
it be done. Let it be done all over again. I mean, why
-- why should we rewrite it up here? Do you have any
authority that requires us or permits us to do that?
MR. COLE: Yes. In -- in Madsen, Justice
Kennedy, you struck -- the Court struck certain provisions
as being unconstitutionally overbroad and left certain
intact. So there's no reason why you can't look at this
injunction, which clearly does not attack paragraph 1.
The -- they do not attack paragraph 1. They do not attack
paragraph 3. They only level their attack at paragraph 2,
and paragraph 2, by striking subsections (ii) and (iii),
would then be limited to the exact conduct in issue, which
is picketing.
JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so if -- before leaving
that point, what the injunction prohibits is that Tory and
those acting in concert, cooperation, or participation
with him from, in a public forum, orally uttering
statements about Cochran. All right. That's what it
says.
Now, do you think that if Tory or someone acting
in cooperation with him says, I've had a change of heart,
Johnnie Cochran is a marvelous person, and he says that on
television -- do you think that individual at that time
has violated this injunction?
MR. COLE: Absolutely not.
JUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely not. Because?
Because?
MR. COLE: First of all, that's --
JUSTICE BREYER: It said the words. They
violated the words. It was a statement, but he has not
violated the injunction because?
MR. COLE: Because I don't believe that's a
public forum.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, no. He does it in a
public forum. In fact, he hires Disney Hall.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: And moreover, he gets on stage
and announces it. Okay? There's no problem about a
public forum. So, now, why doesn't it violate the
injunction?
MR. COLE: Your -- Your Honor, I believe there
are alternative channels of communication here.
JUSTICE BREYER: No. I thought what you were
going to say -- but you're not. So I'm very interested in
that, and I'm glad I asked. I thought you were going to
say when it says uttering statements, it means statements
of the kind or identical to those we have identified
earlier in this opinion.
MR. COLE: Well, I was --
JUSTICE BREYER: But, now, you haven't said
that. I said it, and I think it's too late for you to say
(Laughter.)
MR. COLE: I think I said it when I said there
was a continuing pattern of repetitive conduct under
Pittsburgh Press, over 3 years that that was the conduct
that he has engaged in. And that was clearly the purpose
of this injunction, Justice Breyer. We know that. And
the purpose of the injunction is to enjoin conduct that's
designed to extort money from Mr. Cochran.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: In more than one case,
we've said that an injunction has to be precise and clear
and not leaving things to the imagination.
MR. COLE: Well, I think this is precise and
clear. Based upon the breadth of the injunction, it's
very clear. Based upon this man's prior repetitive
conduct of defaming Mr. Cochran with unprotected speech
for the purpose of attempting to extort money from him --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's -- it's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But nothing in the injunction
refers to prior conduct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. It's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The injunction just speaks for
itself. It doesn't say what -- doing what you used to do
or anything like that.
MR. COLE: The injunction --
JUSTICE STEVENS: You cannot picket Cochran or
Cochran's law firm. Period.
MR. COLE: If we restricted the injunction to
specific words used such as you cannot picket Johnnie
Cochran's law firm and say he's a crook, liar, and thief,
the response will be that he'll come up with five new
words to defame Mr. Cochran for purposes of extorting --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe there are
different grades of specificity. Maybe it doesn't meet
precisely the same words, but I think there are other ways
to draft it that say no picketing. Period.
MR. COLE: Well, there could be no picketing for
purposes of -- no -- which contains defamatory speech for
purposes of extorting Mr. Cochran. But --
JUSTICE STEVENS: All I'm suggesting is just
draft it -- just excising (ii) and (iii) from paragraph 2
would not necessarily solve the problem completely.
Because subparagraph (i) says picketing Cochran or
Cochran's law firm, which is a pretty broad prohibition.
MR. COLE: Well, I would disagree based upon the
prior -- continuing course of -- of repetitive conduct and
the fact that this -- over a period 3 years, once a week,
this man spent 3 to 4 hours a day of his time defaming Mr.
Cochran at his law office. When we enjoined him from
doing so at his law office, he moved it to the Los Angeles
Superior Court.
And I think the fact that Mr. Cochran is a
public figure actually favors the breadth of this
injunction. If this was not a public figure, then the
public forum issue would not be as effective. But because
Mr. Cochran is a public figure, the only way he gets
protection is in the public forum because this gentleman
could move his picketing down to west L.A., Santa Monica
Boulevard, nowhere near a courthouse, and to a public
figure he can inflict the same damage to reputation. And
that is the problem we were contending with in attempting
to draft an injunction that was not overbroad and yet
could control Mr. Tory --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you did draft this
injunction. It wasn't the -- an inspiration from the
judge unaided by your advocacy. Is that so?
MR. COLE: It --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- the terms of this
injunction.
MR. COLE: Were aided -- were aided by my
advocacy, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Aided and abetted.
MR. COLE: Well said, Justice Rehnquist.
What I'm suggesting here is Mr. Cochran would
have been faced with -- he has no remedy. Injunctive
relief is the only remedy. And he would be faced with a
multiplicity of actions --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why couldn't he just be
enjoined from -- from similar defamation? I mean, this --
this enjoins him from -- from true speech. At least he
could -- he could have been enjoined from in the future
defaming Cochran in the same manner. And if he did that,
then -- then he could be punished.
MR. COLE: I think we would be -- that
injunction then would be attacked on being vague or
ambiguous, that Mr. Tory wouldn't have sufficient notice
as to what he was allowed to say and not allowed to say.
I guarantee you that was --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if that's so, then
maybe Mr. Chemerinsky is right. We -- we shouldn't have
injunctions. If you're saying that injunctions can't be
narrowly tailored, it seems to me that you're playing
right into the argument that the petitioner is making.
MR. COLE: No. I think they can be tailored. I
just don't think they can be that narrowly tailored. And
I don't think in this case, which I believe that the test
we should be applying if we're going to balance, is this
-- there's no need for this injunction to be drafted in
the least restrictive means.
I also continue to advance the argument that
this -- the facts of this case are unique. It's the use
of speech to engage in unprotected conduct. This -- this
conduct is not protected by the First Amendment. The
conduct of attempting to extort money from Mr. Cochran is
not protected. If that is not protected, then I believe
we can craft --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You can -- you can
certainly have, you know, some unprotected speech in
connection with extortion, like give me $5 million or I'll
shoot you. But that -- this was a far cry from that. In
other words, it isn't just addressing the victim and
saying give me something. It's denouncing the victim,
which gets into free speech here.
MR. COLE: It certainly does, Justice Rehnquist.
But what I am suggesting is there was no remedy for Mr.
Cochran that would have avoided a multiplicity of actions
other than to draft the injunction in a form that would
preclude Mr. Tory from engaging in the same conduct
without regard to whether it was -- and to let him know
clearly -- give him a safe harbor as to what he could and
could not say.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But the injunction
isn't limited to the same conduct.
MR. COLE: But I don't think it needs to be
because of the pattern and practice that this man has
engaged in over 3 years.
And if we take the example, which is so he has a
change of heart and suddenly he now wants to praise Mr.
Cochran and that's become his -- and he's going to promote
him as mayor of San Francisco, he can certainly go into
the court and modify the injunction.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I thought he lived in
L.A.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think he'd like to get him up
to San Francisco.
(Laughter.)
MR. COLE: He can certainly seek to modify the
injunction, and that, as I pointed out in a subsequent
letter brief, there's -- California doesn't adopt the
collateral bar rule. And therefore, he has a check and
balance in this case. Under People v. Gonzales, 12
Cal.4th 805, the collateral bar rule has no application in
the State of California. So in the unlikely event that
Mr. Tory was engaged in speech praising Mr. Cochran, one,
and two, in the -- in the more unlikely event that someone
was going to attempt to cite him for contempt for engaging
in protected speech, he could contest, under First
Amendment grounds, the enforcement of this injunction in
the State of California because the collateral bar rule
has no impact.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm baffled by
that. What you're saying is that the injunction -- we're
just all wasting our time? The injunction doesn't mean
anything?
MR. COLE: No, no, no, no. Justice Kennedy, all
I'm saying is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I fell off the track
here.
MR. COLE: All I'm -- all I'm saying is that if
the collateral bar rule was in effect, you would waive
your right to contest. You don't have a right to contest
the constitutionality of the injunction on First Amendment
grounds or constitutional grounds when it's seek to be
enforced against you. That's not a defense in a contempt
proceeding. California does not adopt that rule.
Therefore, Mr. Tory can always -- if he is engaged in
protected speech, he can easily contend --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, yes, but he's different
from other citizens because he's at -- he's at risk of a
contempt citation.
MR. COLE: I don't dispute that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, his speech is being
chilled with -- with respect to protected speech.
MR. COLE: But there's nothing unusual --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the collateral bar rule
doesn't help you at all because he's subject to a contempt
citation.
MR. COLE: He's subject to it, but there's a
check and balance there in terms of when you balance, the
potential remedy for Mr. Cochran -- what -- what is going
to give Mr. Cochran the remedy he needs? And if we
balance that against the -- the breadth of this
injunction, I think we have to look at -- one of the
biggest concerns about prior restraints, when analyzed in
terms of injunctions, is the collateral bar rule.
JUSTICE BREYER: But it would be so easy. I
mean, it's virtually no burden. I take it what you're
saying is that this injunction in paragraph 2 at its heart
is aimed at in public forums, keeping insults suggesting
he was a crook against Johnnie Cochran unless you pay me
$10,000. Then I'll stop. Okay? Now, at its heart,
that's what it's aimed at.
MR. COLE: That's exactly --
JUSTICE BREYER: And you are saying if in fact
it's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a
defense. It would violate the First Amendment.
But since it's so easy just to write those words
we just said right in paragraph 2, why shouldn't the judge
have to do it? It's so easy. Say this is aimed at the
heartland just as I said it and you said it, and it
doesn't apply outside of it.
MR. COLE: And I have no dispute with that,
Justice Breyer. I agree that was the whole purpose for
the injunction. That's the basis of the injunction. And
you could always remand for further proceedings,
consistent with any opinion you would write, that the
injunction has to be tailored to -- to deal with
defamatory conduct, which is designed to extort or with
the intent to extort. And I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what he's arguing.
You're -- you're conceding that it's overbroad.
MR. COLE: I'm saying if this Court -- well, I'm
gleaning the impression that this Court thinks it's
overbroad.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ah, you're very perceptive.
(Laughter.)
MR. COLE: And having gleaned that perception,
I'm trying to suggest that, number one, there was no
attack on paragraphs 1 and 3, and now we're focused on
paragraph 2. And paragraph 2 can be tailored, as you have
indicated, Justice Scalia, I think consistent with First
Amendment issues.
And I think it's important to point out that if
we take away injunctive relief in a defamation action in
this day -- modern age --
JUSTICE STEVENS: You're sort of saying the
opposite of what your opponent said. If we take it away,
has it ever been there?
MR. COLE: It's never been there.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What are we taking away?
MR. COLE: I -- I agree it's never -- you've
never found it there and you've never said it can't be
there.
JUSTICE BREYER: How does California work in
that respect? Because what I've been thinking of in my
mind is that maybe we shouldn't decide this in terms of
State law boxes, that California seems to have an action.
Let's call it a buzz action to get away from words. And
what that action is it's a defamation but a certain kind.
It's defamation accompanied by extortion. And when you
have defamation accompanied by extortion -- call it
whatever you want -- an injunction is proper in these
circumstances.
Now, can we decide it in such a way that we're
not talking about all defamation actions? We are talking
about this beast in California which uses the word
defamation but also finds injunction and therefore issues
-- also finds extortion and therefore issues an
injunction.
MR. COLE: Yes, I think that you could limit the
injunction to defamatory speech of a similar nature
designed to extort.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would that make Mr.
Cochran happy? What -- what's the big deal about
extortion? I mean, suppose this same conduct occurs in
the future, but he doesn't say I'll stop if you give me a
lot of money. He just pickets every day and says Cochran
is a shyster, don't do any business with Cochran. Do you
think Mr. Cochran would be any -- any happier simply
because the guy says I'll -- hasn't said I'll stop if you
pay me $10,000?
MR. COLE: No, and I think that would be subject
to the same injunctive relief. I think this case is
unique with the extortion element, but I don't disagree,
Justice Scalia, that that is why any decision that says
injunctions in defamation actions would be improper. I
think people would start defaming with impunity.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You've got to give us some
line. I mean, the only reason we're grabbing onto
extortion is that -- that there's reluctance to say you
can issue injunctions in all defamation actions. Now,
what -- what limitation do you want to place upon the
ability to issue an injunction if it is not defamation
combined with extortion?
MR. COLE: I don't think you need to place a
limitation other than you can enjoin the defamatory
conduct. Take, for example, the Internet. A posting goes
on of a -- of a business that -- a startup company. It
can't -- damages of -- for a startup company -- they're
very difficult to prove.
JUSTICE BREYER: But then you run into the
public figure. I mean, that's a much more dangerous kind
of rule of law, isn't it? I mean, a pure defamation
action against a public figure, which they want to say
this is. You can write all kinds of things about public
figures. People can and do, for better or for worse. Do
-- is there any authority for issuing in a pure defamation
action an injunction?
MR. COLE: There's no authority, but there's no
authority that says you can't do it.
But what I am suggesting is in -- is in a pure
defamation action that's not tied to any specific wrongful
conduct, there's no reason why you couldn't enjoin. For
example, if you found that a specific item was defamatory
on its face, such as a posting on the Internet, the only
way to get that posting off the Internet would be to
enjoin it because damages aren't going to solve the
problem. And if it's -- even if it's purely defamatory,
you could restrict it to that purely defamatory posting,
similar to -- to the obscenity cases where you've reviewed
a film, you found it to be obscene, and then you preclude
it. There are procedural safeguards and you preclude it
in the future.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you've just said
something that I think that's inconsistent with your
earlier presentation. You said you could enjoin that
posting. Here you said it wouldn't be effective just to
enjoin the particular placards that were used, the
particular words because then there would be other words.
So the same question could come up with an Internet
posting if you had an injunction not simply on what was
posted but anything about this particular individual that
might be posted in the future.
MR. COLE: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think where
that leaves us is you'd have to engage in some sort of
balancing about the -- how narrowly tailored the
injunction is and does it provide a sufficient remedy and,
you know -- and -- and in this -- and what test we would
analyze it under, strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny,
or the Ward test. And -- and I think that in applying
those tests, you'd have to come to a balance, and if the
balance is that you're going to limit it to a specific
type of speech or -- then that -- that would be a -- a
reasonable limit, and if it creates a multiplicity of
actions, well, so be it. But at least there's a remedy
for that posting or postings of a similar nature. So --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, you -- you -- to the
extent that you're complaining about extortion-like
conduct, something else that you drafted -- I'm looking at
the complaint on page 7 of the joint appendix. You have
identified all defamatory, including with the false light
invasion of privacy, but you don't have any claim that
looks like blackmail.
MR. COLE: If you'd -- if I could direct you,
Justice Ginsburg, to page 12 of the joint appendix at
paragraphs (j) and (k) of the verified complaint, you will
see that we alleged in a verified complaint that he'd
engaged in three previous efforts of this same type of
conduct, one. And two, paragraph (k), that Tory is in the
business of professionally extorting monies from innocent
persons and business --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I was going to ask you
about that. Were there findings to substantiate the
allegations?
MR. COLE: Findings to substantiate --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Specifically about the
extorting money from the bank and the oil company.
MR. COLE: No, Justice Kennedy, there were not.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No findings.
MR. COLE: There was some testimony only on one
of those issues, which was the oil company. There was no
findings on this issue.
But then I would refer you to paragraph (k)
which specifically refers to extorting of monies. And
also in my opening statement, as is reflected in the
trial's transcript, the -- the first thing I said is this
is speech designed for an improper purpose. It's
unprotected speech designed to extort money from Mr.
Cochran. That was the whole theme --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what -- what I mean is
could you have -- without using the label defamation, have
stated a claim for extortion or blackmail? I'm not
looking at your particular allegations but how you
described on page 1 of the complaint what you were suing
for: libel, libel per se, slander, slander per se, and
invasion of privacy.
MR. COLE: I think we could have pled extortion
had we chose to. We could have pled inference with
advantageous business relations. We probably could have
pled California's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does California law require
you to label the type of the cause of action or is it
notice pleading based on facts?
MR. COLE: Notice pleading based on facts, but
we do label the causes of action. The -- the point I'm
trying to make is whether every cause of action was pled,
if the conduct is extortion, which is what the judge
implicitly found by findings 20 and 27, that conduct is
not protected. And whether we named the cause of action
correct in the complaint or we sued for that specified
cause of action, doesn't change what it is that we were
seeking relief for, which is stopping this man from
defaming Mr. Cochran until he was paid money.
We attempted to achieve that. We thought we did
a fair job in paragraphs 1 and 3, which they don't attack
and I agree is not fairly included within the question
which has been certified here, nor is an attack on the
underlying finding.
But we attempted in paragraph 2, broadly I
agree, to avoid a multiplicity of actions and to give Mr.
Tory other channels of communication other than the public
forum where he is engaged in a continuing course of
repetitive conduct to defame Mr. Cochran.
He -- and -- and this is -- one point that I
want to stress. We don't view this injunction as being
violated if he went on TV, he went on the radio, he went
in the newspapers. We don't view those as public forums
under the definition that this Court has provided. Those
are not public forums. We are not concerned about that.
We do not believe that those events will occur. We did
not seek to protect them. So we have given Mr. Tory an
unlimited venue to speak, but we said you can't do this in
the public forum because of your continuing course of
repetitive conduct, 3 years, once a week, 52 times a year,
over 150 times, 4 hours a day.
And with that, I would submit that while the
injunction is broad, I don't believe it's a
unconstitutional prior restraint, and to the extent this
Court believes it is overbroad, I believe striking
subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 2 would solve
the problem, or alternatively, that in conjunction with a
suggestion that it needs to be narrowed to deal with the
speech and conduct in issue.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cole.
Mr. Chemerinsky, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Thank you.
Justice Breyer kindly invited my thoughts about
how an opinion might be written, and there are three
different ways not mutually exclusive.
One is that this injunction is vastly overbroad
for all the reasons that have been identified. Mr. Cole
said a couple of things. One, he said that Mr. Tory can
go to court and ask for modification of the injunction,
but that's what makes this a prior restraint, that Mr.
Tory can only speak again if he goes to court and gets
permission.
Also, he said at the end that Mr. Tory can go
before the media. However, under California law, under
Damon v. Ocean Hill, the media is defined as a public
forum.
A second way the opinion could be written is
that this for speech protected by the First Amendment.
Justice Ginsburg, you asked me at the outset whether
that's in the scope of the question presented. Well, it
is directly relevant to what Mr. Cole was saying. Because
it's all opinion, all hyperbole it is protected by the
First Amendment and can't be the basis for an extortion
claim.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you're asking us now
to -- the -- the trial court found there was defamation,
and now you want to argue, no, it wasn't defamation. It
was mere opinion. I really don't see how that's included
in the question presented.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: I think it is because it goes
to the question whether the injunction is permissible.
But I go on to the third way that the opinion
could be written, and that's that injunctions are not
permissible as a remedy in a defamation case. We agree
that if there is a cause of action for extortion, it can
have an injunction as a remedy. We agree if the cause of
action is for harassment, there can be an injunction as a
remedy. But those have specific elements that have to be
met. Those elements weren't met in this case.
History is clear that injunctions aren't allowed
in defamation cases, and also, Your Honor, it's quite
important that Mr. Cole even said you can't craft a narrow
injunction in a defamation case. Any injunction is either
too narrow or too broad.
In Near v. Minnesota, this Court said that it
was telling that in 150 years of the history of the First
Amendment, there had never been an injunction approved by
this Court in a defamation case. We're now 70 years later
than that. To approve an injunction in a case like this,
even though it's called defamation plus extortion, will
open the door to injunctions as a routine matter in
defamation cases across the country. No --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There have been -- there have
been injunctions against harassing conduct, threatening,
stalking.
MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, and we have
no objection to injunctions of that sort. What we object
to is an injunction as a remedy in a defamation case and
an injunction that is directed at speech. That's what the
First Amendment prohibits.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
Chemerinsky.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:11 a.m., the case in the
