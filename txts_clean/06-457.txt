CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
this morning in case 06-457, Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor
Transport Association.
Mr. Stern.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL STERN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STERN: Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
Congress has left to the States and
encouraged them to deal with the significant public
health problem of youth access to tobacco. The question
presented is whether the FAAA Act nonetheless preempts
the two State laws before the Court and those laws that
ensure that tobacco shipped into the State of Maine does
not end up in the hands of our children.
It is not contested that Maine can and, in
fact, has banned the retail sale of tobacco unless the
seller verifies the age of the buyer. Section
55-C(3)(C) regulates the seller and not a carrier. It
requires that a -- in the context of a delivery sale, a
seller cannot engage in that sale in the State of Maine
unless the seller ensures that the person delivering the
tobacco actually verifies the age of the buyer. This
law does not relate to the services of the carrier, but
rather relates to a dangerous substance that Congress
has asked the States and left to the States and
encouraged the States to deal with.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, certainly that
may be true, but it certainly relates to the service of
a carrier.  I understood your argument to be that we
can't read that language literally.
MR. STERN: Exactly --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It talks about what
carriers have to do, so -- in connection with delivery,
so it relates to the service of the motor carrier.
MR. STERN: Well, Your Honor, section 1555-C
(3)(C) does not dictate at all what a carrier has to do.
It is an incentive that permits a carrier, if the
carrier wishes to compete on a level playing field for
the legal tobacco delivery market --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't dictate
what they have to do. They can get out of the business.
MR. STERN: They can get out of the business
or compete for the business, Your Honor. But the point
is that the law regulates the retailer and not the
carrier and, in doing so, similar to the situation in
Travelers, allows for a market to be created.
In particular, however, with respect to this
particular situation, Congress has spoken directly to it
and this Court has considered in the context of its
ERISA cases how Congress has dealt specifically with the
problem before the Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we also
considered it in Morales, and I thought this law was
enacted in the immediate wake of Morales, which adopted
a much broader reading of "relates to" than the
subsequent ERISA cases.
MR. STERN: We don't agree that it adopted
such a broad view because in Morales the Court was very
careful in the opinion to make clear that it was not
drawing a line which would bring potentially such laws
dealing with gambling or prostitution within the
preemptive ambit of the ADA. Similarly, in -- with
respect to the FAA Act, particularly looking at the
legislative history, there is no indication that
Congress intended in any way to deal with the State's
controlling and regulating dangerous substances such as
tobacco.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that answering
the wrong question? I'll be candid with you. I'm not
sure that whatever Morales-Travelers distinction there
is really counts here, because the issue here is
different from the issue in some of the -- in most of
the preemption cases, because the issue here starts with
the, I think, the agreed assumption that Congress wanted
to end a certain category of regulation.
And the question is would Congress have
wanted, in effect, to permit a degree of State
regulation when it was for a particular purpose?
And the question then is not whether
Congress intended or had as an object when it passed
this statute an interference with the State's regulation
of juvenile contraband. The question is whether it
intended to permit any regulation with respect to
delivery services to survive; and isn't that the tough
question that you've got to face?
MR. STERN: Your Honor, looking at the
objectives of Congress as explained by Congress in the
legislative record, it's very clear that Congress was
concerned, the committee was concerned with, the
proponents such as the Federal Department of
Transportation, were concerned with the effects of the
particular category of regulation, State economic
regulation. The committee mentioned that nine times.
The United States --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's because most
regulation, you know, has an economic purpose involved.
But the ultimate object, it seems to me, was to end the
economic effects of State patchwork transportation
regulation.
And therefore I think the question you've
got to address is why would they have allowed a certain
category of regulation that clearly affects the way
these companies perform their services to survive solely
on the ground that the regulation was entailed at the
State level by the State's choice to go against youthful
tobacco use?
MR. STERN: Well, Your Honor, we suggest
that the Court looks at the FAA Act and its legislative
history, as well as what immediately preceded it, which
was the Synar Amendment. The Synar Amendment encouraged
the States to deal with this problem. The Federal
Government --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But the Synar -- I don't
have it in front of me, but the Synar Amendment refers
to -- to a number of objects of State legislation that
would be required, but it doesn't say anything about
regulating transportation.
MR. STERN: It states quite clearly that the
intent is to encourage the States to prohibit -- or to
enforce/enact laws that prohibit retailers and
distributors from getting tobacco to children.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And we don't
normally think of a delivery service as a distributor of
goods. I mean, we -- in the sense, I think, that the
statute meant.
I -- I read the Synar Amendment reference to
distributors as being wholesalers, people within the
industry who get the cigarettes from, you know, the
manufacturing point to the corner store, as opposed
simply to a delivery service that delivers all kinds of
goods.
MR. STERN: Well, a sale consists of several
components, Your Honor: Order, payment, and delivery.
Handing it over, handing the tobacco over physically to
the buyer, from the standpoint of the buyer's standpoint
and from the standpoint of public health perspective, is
the most important aspect of the transaction.
It is the seller who has the responsibility
to comply with the law with respect to each one of those
steps.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stern, at the time
that the motor carrier deregulation came into effect,
were there any products where Maine told the retailer,
if you want to sell not face-to-face, you must choose a
carrier that will provide X, Y, and Z services? Was
there any -- is tobacco alone or were there other
commodities?
MR. STERN: Interestingly, there -- Maine
being a hunting State, there was a law on the books
which required the common carrier -- it specifically
referred to the common carrier -- to verify that the
person shipping it was the hunter with the appropriate
license, required the common carrier to affix
identification tags to the hunting -- the hunting
reward, so to speak, and also to make a return or
provide notice to the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries
and Wildlife.
So Maine had a variety of those sorts of
laws on the books that required carriers to actually do
something with respect to a particular type of
commodity.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the Postal Service
adhere to -- or I don't know if the Postal Service is
used to ship cigarettes, tobacco products. But if it
is, does the Postal Service adhere to Maine's
requirement?
MR. STERN: Two points, Your Honor. First,
the Postal Service has immunity from Maine laws. And
second, the Postal Service, interestingly, does have an
addressee verification service for $4.10.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does the Post Office
have immunity from Maine laws? Really?
MR. STERN: I believe there --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You could kill people and
all sorts of stuff. I mean --
(Laughter.)
MR. STERN: I hope not, Your Honor. But
with respect to a variety of civil regulatory matters, I
believe the courts have concluded that the United States
Postal Service has immunity from Maine -- from Maine and
other State laws.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it does -- you say
the Postal Service provides something that conforms,
that they have the -- you must deliver it to the person,
to the addressee herself?
MR. STERN: Yes, Your Honor. It is not
exactly conforming because -- it's sort of interesting.
Different carrier services or the Postal Service have
different sort of options that seem to make clear that
this is not a real problem to provide. The U.S. Postal
Service provides an addressee verification service, but
not an age verification service. UPS provides an age
verification service, but not an addressee verification
service.
Since one costs $2.75 and the other one
costs $4.10, this does not seem to be an acute problem
to -- for a carrier, if it wishes to compete for the
market, to actually compete for it and price it
appropriately.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But why aren't you just
driving all this business to the Postal Service? I
mean, you know, what have you accomplished? You'd drive
FedEx out of business if they choose not to incur the
additional expense. And so, you know, all these people
just ship it through the Postal Service.
MR. STERN: There have been efforts to deal
with the Postal Service loophole, Your Honor, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't do it. I mean,
they're exempt from Maine laws. Didn't you know that?
(Laughter.)
MR. STERN: I think I heard somebody mention
that, Your Honor.
(Laughter.)
MR. STERN: Certainly, in another branch of
government, that -- there's an effort to deal with that
problem. But, with respect to the suggestion we've
driven FedEx out of business, there's no suggestion --
well, first of all, we have no evidence with respect to
what this effect has had on FedEx. With respect to UPS,
UPS continues to ship tobacco to licensees and has not
shown in the record that they lost any business with any
of their customers, obtained licenses from the State of
Maine, and therefore it could actually ship into the
State of Maine.
JUSTICE ALITO: But what if every -- what if
every State enacted a slightly different law relating to
this and a slightly different law relating to every
other product that they might want to restrict for
health or safety reasons? Would you -- would you agree
then with the Respondent that there would be just the
kind of patchwork of regulation at the State level that
this statute was intended to stop?
MR. STERN: Well, Your Honor, the
Respondent's arguments do not guarantee uniform
regulation. In fact, they guarantee exactly the
opposite. They don't dispute that Maine and other
States can ban the transport and delivery of what we can
call unlicensed tobacco, tobacco from unlicensed
retailers, to unlicensed entities. Different States can
have different licensing requirements and certainly
different licensees. So a patchwork is created.
In addition, Respondents agree that States
can outright ban the furnishing of a variety of
commodities or contraband, including in particular
tobacco or alcohol --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that wasn't
clear from their brief. I thought they had a footnote
that said they weren't arguing the point in this case,
but I thought they didn't concede the total ban.
MR. STERN: I believe if one looks at --
it's either page 24 or 44 of the brief -- they concede
that Maine and other States can ban the furnishing of
tobacco.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they --
JUSTICE SOUTER: They concede that they can
do it beyond the requirement, beyond the force of the
statute that precludes the knowing distribution. In
other words, they -- they're not appealing the one
provision of subsection D that makes it a crime
knowingly to get the tobacco into the hands of minors
and so on, but do they concede anything beyond that?
MR. STERN: I believe they do, Your Honor.
I believe -- I think it's at page 44 -- they concede
that Maine can ban the furnishing of tobacco by anyone,
including a carrier.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I think that the
reason they make that concession is that they say you
must prove knowledge, and they're -- they're not
concerned about the -- about intentionally transgressing
Maine's law. What they're concerned about is the
additional steps that you require them to go through to
make sure that there is no tobacco.
So they're not really worried about it so
long as you have a knowledge requirement.
MR. STERN: Well, there is a knowledge
requirement in the first part of section 1555-D. And
Your Honor's question gets right to the nub of the
problem with respect to the lower court's decision on
55-D, which is: How does Maine or any other State go
about proving knowing delivery of an unlicensed product
such as this?
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you prove it without
a presumption to start with. That's what the -- that's
way the issue was left by the district court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's why they're not
worried about it, because it's hard to prove.
MR. STERN: Without the evidentiary
assumption, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to
prove, which essentially makes the first part of the
court's decision with respect to 1555 --
JUSTICE BREYER: The answer to that is it
may be a very good idea, so convince Congress to pass a
law. It's just that if every State does it differently
it's going to be a nightmare. And I don't know what the
answer to that point is.
And I don't know what the answer to the
point is about banning things. I'm amazed if that's
what you mean. I'm not sure what you mean. I mean,
North Carolina could pass a statute that says the
following: Everybody in North Carolina over the age 16,
say, or maybe everybody including small children -- I
don't know what they want to pass -- can smoke to their
heart's delight, can buy as many cigarettes as they
like, but you can't ship in a single cigarette from out
of State.
You think that wouldn't cause -- raise a
Commerce Clause problem?
MR. STERN: A Commerce Clause problem?
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. STERN: It depends upon how the statute
is written. If it banned --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's why I'm just
not certain about bans that forbid people to ship things
inside from outside the State, while allowing people to
buy those things produced by people inside the State.
That's why I'm uncertain about the concession you're
talking about.
MR. STERN: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what is this New
York law that does this?
MR. STERN: The New York law banned the
delivery and sale of tobacco -- delivery and sales of
cigarettes to B(2) --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't that the result
of a settlement?
MR. STERN: The -- the law was -- existed
before the settlement, and the settlement which we have
referred to is a situation where UPS and a number of
other carriers have agreed to conform with it, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And nationwide, not just
in New York; isn't that so?
MR. STERN: Yes, Your Honor. And it -- it
reveals, we think, that the -- that the nature of the
laws here are not so burdensome as to run afoul of this
Court's concerns --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, then, practically,
you don't have a problem with cigarettes because the New
York settlement takes care of it. You're just talking
about other tobacco products?
MR. STERN: Well, there are other tobacco
products, but in the New York settlement -- we can't
enforce the New York settlement, Your Honor. We have
our own separate law, particularly section --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought, as a
result of the New York settlement, carriers are no
longer shipping directly to consumers anyplace
cigarettes.
MR. STERN: That is the intent of that, Your
Honor. I'm not sure how effective it has been. But by
doing that, they have agreed and put in place a system
where tobacco products can only be shipped from a
licensee.
JUSTICE BREYER: But the thing I'm concerned
about is -- is assume it's perfectly legal to do what
you said. I guess it still wouldn't be legal for Maine
or New York to say the following: We really want to
discourage people from smoking, a noble goal. And,
therefore, whenever an interstate shipper ships tobacco
into the State, he has to charge double the price, just
double the shipment price or ten times the shipment
price. Could they say that?
MR. STERN: That would seem to clearly run
afoul of the --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right.
MR. STERN: -- Commerce Clause.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But could they
say you have to carry it in special packages which the
sticker -- which maybe you should do, but which the
sticker puts skull and crossbones on each of the
packages? Could they say that?
MR. STERN: I don't think --
JUSTICE BREYER: No. All right.
MR. STERN: -- they necessarily could, Your
Honor.
JUDGE BREYER: If they cannot say either of
those things because of the statute, why can they say:
What you have to do is you have to ship it in a way that
makes certain that the person who receives it, the
addressee, is the person who bought it?
MR. STERN: The reason, Your Honor, is the
difference between the hypothetical you proposed at the
beginning of your question and what's going on in Maine
with respect to 1555-C(3)(C), which is a mouthful.
At the time the FAAA Act was enacted, it was
illegal for anyone to -- an unlicensed retailer, to sell
tobacco in the State of Maine, and it was illegal to
sell tobacco without verifying the age of the buyer.
That's the generally applicable law that was -- a
judicial sort of law that was on the books in 1994.
The skull and crossbones requirement is not
a judicial type of law, and what this Court has done in
the ERISA cases is look to see the -- the purpose and
type of law that is before it to determine whether it
was a type of law that was in existence and whether
there was any positive indication that -- that that sort
of law was supposed to be pre-empted or not.
--
Here these sorts of age verification laws
were on the books. We have identified the problem and
everybody understands the problem with respect to
delivery and sales.
It would be absurd for an over-the-counter
clerk to take money from someone --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stern, can I ask you
this question: To what extent are we dealing with a
tobacco problem or a broader problem? Do you have other
products that are contraband such as -- or have special
restrictions on who can ship wild animals, prescription
drugs, firearms; or are there other products that you
regulate in the same way?
MR. STERN: There are no -- I'm not aware of
any that we -- we regulate in the same way. In similar
JUSTICE STEVENS: You allow shippers to ship
firearms and poisonous substances without having this
kind of restriction on it, do you?
MR. STERN: There are not exactly the same
restrictions. But, with respect to alcohol, we have a
law on the books which prohibits the knowing sale or
transfer of alcohol to somebody who is underage.
Because of the -- the unique situation we
found with respect to delivery and sales of tobacco,
we've put this in place to make it clear how a seller
goes about conforming with Maine's generally applicable
law.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But I don't really see why
the States have -- have a different interest in
regulating shipment of tobacco to minors than they would
a variety of other substances that could be harmful to
minors or contraband in general. And you don't try to
regulate any of those?
MR. STERN: Well, Your Honor, we do try to
regulate those. I misunderstood your question.
JUSTICE STEVENS: By -- by regulating how
they may be shipped, I mean.
MR. STERN: There is no law exactly like
this one with respect to the other types of -- of
dangerous substances. There is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stern, you told me in
-- in response to my question earlier, you mentioned
only, I think, game; and you said that those
prohibitions were directly on the carrier --
MR. STERN: That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that is, prohibitions
and instructions for how you can ship game. And I don't
know if that -- if there are other food products. You
mentioned only that one.
And is it not the case that explosives --
that that's Federal regulation?
MR. STERN: The Federal Government has a
role with respect to the shipment of explosives, but it
has no role with respect to the shipment of tobacco.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is there -- in
addition to the Federal regulation, which I take it
would cover various dangerous substances, does Maine add
to what the Federal regulation is, say, for sending
fireworks, firearms?
MR. STERN: With respect to fireworks, Maine
in its discretion has adopted the Federal role -- the
Federal view, which, I think, emphasizes and -- and
highlights the different situation we have here.
When the Federal Government believed there
should be some sort of uniform regulation of a
particular dangerous item, be it fireworks, for example,
or hazardous material, it does so. Otherwise, it leaves
it to the States.
And this is a situation where if the State
doesn't act to deal with the problem of delivery and
sales, we have a regulatory void and nobody deals with
this problem.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe because
Congress wanted the regulatory void. Maybe Congress
didn't want these things to be enforced by regulating
the transporter, as opposed to regulating the shipper
and the receiver.
As far as the game regulation is concerned,
isn't it the case that UPS won't carry any game now
because of the -- because of your game regulations?
MR. STERN: In their policies, they have
indicated that they do not carry game, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's too onerous.
MR. STERN: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you've sort of driven
them out of the business.
MR. STERN: No. Your Honor, UPS has a
variety of options such as a cash-on-delivery option
which requires them to run around and find somebody with
a check, money order, or credit card. So they can price
these. It's just a matter of whether they want to
compete for them.
And, again, with respect to C(3)(C), which
I'd like to focus on for a moment, it would be absurd,
we think, to have a situation where a clerk in an
over-the-counter sale could accept money from a buyer,
verify the age of the buyer, and then turn to a third
person and hand the tobacco to that person without the
buyer being present.
That is exactly the situation that
Respondents ask this Court to embrace as the intent of
Congress. And with respect to Your Honor's--
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, as long as the buyer
is not an interstate carrier, there is really no -- no
problem of conflicting with Federal law.
MR. STERN: Well, there is no conflict with
Federal law under our reading of the FAAA Act and the
Synar Amendment because the -- the intent of Congress
has to be one which does not end up in an absurd result.
And we suggest that having this gaping conduit of
tobacco to children is just such an absurd result.
If the Court has no further questions now,
I'd like to reserve my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Stern.
Ms. Brinkmann.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
If Maine's tobacco delivery law is not
preempted, Congress's core purpose for the FAAAA will be
defeated. There will be different delivery laws in
States across the country, and that patchwork will
eliminate the efficiency and the cost savings that was
Congress's intent in the FAAAA when it enacted it to
deregulate the industry.
If I could, I'd like to try and quantify for
you the enormous impact and effect that these two
provisions have on carrier services.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you do that,
Ms. Brinkmann, would you tell us how alcohol is handled,
because that is, as I understand it, that's by virtue of
the 24th Amendment State regulation. Does UPS carry
alcohol packages from one State to another?
MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, alcohol is, of course,
governed by a different legal regime because of the 21st
Amendment. And yes, they do provide services for wine
and beer only, and that service has to be pursuant to a
contract. It is a special contract with the shipper,
and the shipper has to be licensed.
And UPS and the other carriers have uniform
procedures for doing that, so they are not subject to a
patchwork of regulation, unless there are laws in the
States that are allowed because of the 21st Amendment.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I asked the question
only in response to your impossibility argument that you
couldn't cope with such State regulations with respect
to tobacco, when it seems you are with respect to
alcohol.
MS. BRINKMANN: I think it would be useful
to give the quantification, I think, about the impact of
these provisions. I would first point out that the
services that are provided right now are in response to
the market and market competition, which was Congress's
intent. And these, of course, would be services that
were created in response to a State dictate, which is at
the core of the problem.
But just to give you an idea about the
C(3)(C), which is the delivery confirmation --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Before you leave the
alcohol point, I don't quite understand the relevance of
the 21st Amendment. It seems to me if you can
pre-empt -- if Federal law can pre-empt State laws that
are authorized by the 21st Amendment, I don't understand
how that has anything to do with the preemption issue.
MS. BRINKMANN: I think it involves much
more complicated constitutional issues that reach the
st Amendment. I think even in light of this Court's
opinion in Granholm v. Heald, there would be more
complex issues to analyze --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't it still a State
regulation of shipping, even if it's a law that's
authorized by the 21st Amendment? I don't see the
difference.
MS. BRINKMANN: Well, it may be not be, Your
Honor. The problem has been taken care of by this
uniform service, and I have to say that is at the age of
. That is an adult confirmation. And that is not an
addressee-specific requirement.
Here under C(3)(C), it would be a new
service that required the actual addressee to sign for
it. And I should comment, my understanding of U.S.
Postal Service is it doesn't have to be the addressee
who signs. They can designate someone else to sign for
it, and there is no age verification. But here it has
to be the addressee, and there has to be photo
government ID for anyone between 18 and 27. And if I
could just for --
JUSTICE STEVENS: What if a new carrier
said, well, I'd like to get into the business of
shipping tobacco products, none of the other companies
want to do it, I want to form -- I'll form my own
company. It will meet all these requirements. Would it
-- would it then be pre-empted?
MS. BRINKMANN: If the State was dictating a
service that made --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they're saying the
retailer must use a service that fulfills these
qualifications. And if there are services out there,
why would the law be pre-empted?
MS. BRINKMANN: It would depend on the
effect on the carriers. And if I could --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that the purpose
of the Federal law was not to enable services which
would not otherwise be provided at all, but rather to
enable services to be provided more economically, to
reduce the cost, the cost of interstate transportation.
MS. BRINKMANN: Driven by market
competition, Your Honor. The evidence --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. Somebody would come
in to occupy the void, but he would charge a heck of a
lot more.
MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, in this case the
evidence demonstrates -- in the court of appeals
appendix there's the deposition by Ms. Meisel, which
explains on pages 163 and 189 that it's not flipping a
switch to create a new service like this. Many systems
would have to be completely reengineered to take in new
data about age and addressee. There would have to be a
new system for the alert. There would have to be a new
system for reading the alert. That takes one
and-a-half years, 18 months, for that modification to
occur. That's an enormous effect.
And I would also like just to look at --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's the effect on
UPS; is that not right?
MS. BRINKMANN: On the carrier services.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that foreclose the
possibility that somebody else might just specialize in
delivering tobacco products, for example?
MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, if there were a
requirement or Maine law, for example, for a widely
already established adult signature requirement, that
may have a different preemption analysis. There
certainly would not be the problems of uniformity. But
I don't think it could be something that's dictated.
And if a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't there would be
a problem? I don't understand that. There would still
be a problem with uniformity from State to State.
MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think if Maine did
it for all products it would be okay? It's only they're
doing it for tobacco that makes it bad?
MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think so.
MS. BRINKMANN: That cost that I just
described has to be multiplied for 50 States and many
commodities.
And also, if you look at the 1555-D, the
prohibition on unlicensed tobacco retailers sending to a
consume and the imputed knowledge, the law that has
strict liability on the carrier, if there is a box that
has a shipper's name from the attorney general's list,
that imputed knowledge would require that every one of
the 65,000 or 16 million packages going to Maine every
year be examined for the shipper identification.
And in the record, there is -- the State has
admitted at J-96 that that kind of research to look
into -- in this case it was looking at the sender, but
it would be the same for the shipper -- I mean, it was
looking for the addressee; this would be for the shipper
-- is two dollars per package.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How did they deal with
under the New York settlement? I take it this would be
a problem under that settlement, because it doesn't
touch selling from a duly licensed dealer. And so,
under the New York settlement, which operates
nationwide, what does the carrier do to make sure that
the recipient is a licensed dealer?
MS. BRINKMANN: Under the New York
settlement there's a very complex structure that the
carriers have agreed to, first of all forbidding all
delivery of cigarettes to consumers.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does that appear in
the materials? Do you remember where it is?
MS. BRINKMANN: There is a citation to it in
the Petitioner's brief, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But there's no text,
though?
MS. BRINKMANN: It's available, I believe,
on the attorney general of New York's web site. There's
a very -- for example, in the UPS assurance of
discontinuance, there's a three-tier disciplinary scheme
against shippers that are found to violate that.
And the carriers entered into these
agreements under threat of criminal sanctions. The New
York statute made one offense a misdemeanor and a second
offense a felony. And the carriers, who had been trying
to abide by those laws, were faced with subpoenas and
the threat of prosecution. And so their solution was a
uniform nationwide policy, no cigarettes to consumers.
But of course --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Ms. Brinkmann, I'm
interested in two things. Number one, I want to make
sure you completed the quantification point that you
made, and you pointed us to someplace in the record,
because the Petitioner said, oh, it just costs a penny a
package or something like that.
And then the second point, I think probably
not related, is the question of knowledge. I take it
you're not contesting if there's actual knowledge that
it's a minor that there can be a prosecution. I'm not
sure how that works if the company -- because of the
imputed knowledge. Suppose an officer of the company or
some shipping clerk knows it. Wouldn't the company be
liable if the company were subject to -- those are two
different questions.
MS. BRINKMANN: To your first question, just
to complete it, Your Honor, at JA-96 there's an
admission that it's a two-dollar cost to research a
package. There it's for the addressee, but it would be
the same for the shipper. And if you had to do that for
the 16 million packages going to Maine a year just
through UPS, it would be $32 million a year.
Turning to your knowledge point, I think
this is a very important point that the Court was
discussing earlier and, Justice Scalia, I think you were
discussing about the general ban. Justice Ginsburg, you
mentioned our footnote.
You have to know that the details of the ban
are to figure out whether or not it is pre-empted. In
this case, the First Circuit at Pet. App. 29 explains
why its construction of the first sentence of 1555-D,
which prohibits any person from knowingly transporting
contraband tobacco, is now pre-empted. But it makes
very clear that the State law is pre-empted, Pet. App.
, to the extent that Maine's tobacco delivery law
requires or has the effect of requiring carriers to
implement State-mandated procedures in the processing or
delivery of packages as pre-empted by the FAAAA.
So to the extent there is a general ban
against knowing transportation that does not require --
that does not impose a strict liability requirement --
it's a strict liability that says it's not just knowing,
you have to look at every shipper's name. You have to
look at every side of that box. And then you have to
decide who the recipient is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Brinkmann, I'm
fascinated by this New York settlement. You -- you say
that -- that Maine can't do this. But you say if a
bunch of States do it, and they twist the carriers' arms
hard enough by threatening criminal penalties, so that
the carriers say, okay, I give up; and then they agree
to limit their transport, that's okay?
MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor. I'm sorry
if I gave that impression. That was a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean you're
speaking about the New York settlement as though that's
hunky-dory.
MS. BRINKMANN: No, it isn't. This --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that if this
-- if this Federal act means what it says, that that
kind of settlement isn't the kind of thing the act did
not want to happen.
MS. BRINKMANN: Well, it's a voluntary
agreement in which --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Voluntary under threat of
criminal penalty.
MS. BRINKMANN: -- in which the carriers
adopted a uniform approach.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's -- that's
nice. But what about the consumer? The act was not
just for the convenience of the carriers. It was meant
to -- to serve the convenience and the economic benefit
of the consumer.
I -- I expect a consumer might be able to
challenge that -- that New York settlement. I'm
surprised you accepted it as, well, you know, so long as
the carrier coughs it up, it's okay.
MS. BRINKMANN: No, the assurances of
discontinuance -- specifically, I know that Federal
Express and UPS have reserved the right and do not
--
concede that the New York law is not preempted under
FAAAA. There is no concession there, Your Honor. I
want to make that abundantly clear.
I also wanted to address the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just on the knowledge
point, I'm still not sure. I don't want to ask you if
you concede that knowing delivery would make you liable.
That's what the First Circuit said. I suppose that's
not before us, so I have to take that as a premise, as a
given.
MS. BRINKMANN: I think, though, if I could
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little bit hard to
write the opinion your way with that, with that
concession. That's my problem. Or with that premise.
MS. BRINKMANN: I think if you understand
what the First Circuit was saying, this is a total ban
on knowing delivery. It doesn't require the carrier to
change their services. So we -- the carriers don't have
to go out and in the hundreds of countries that they
operate change the intake procedure for shipments to be
able to have all the data and all the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but they are presumed
to have read the label, the stamp on the label; isn't
that correct?
MS. BRINKMANN: You go to the end of the
system, is where the knowledge would come into place.
In reality, under the current operating services that
are provided --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you answer my
question? May they presume that if the package is
labeled cigarettes, that the delivery -- the delivery
person knows that?
MS. BRINKMANN: I wouldn't necessarily say a
presumption, Your Honor. It is evidence that can be
used.
That -- we recognize that. I think some of
the amici suggest that we say it cannot. It can be
used. It's not a presumption. It is not something that
deems knowledge. I can just give you some examples of
practicality.
The two employees who actually see the box,
loaders and sorters, it's going by so fast, they don't
-- aren't reading anything. The preloader who puts it
into the truck --
JUSTICE STEVENS: When they pick up the
package, they don't look at the labels?
MS. BRINKMANN: -- and the driver.
But what you have to understand is sometimes
they're packed four high. Some deliveries are ten to
one business and each side of each box is not viewed.
Oftentimes the scan on the bar code is done from a
distance. They don't -- what the loaders look at is the
ZIP-code, and actually with increased automation -- and
Mr. Butler's deposition, which was filed on -- back in
June of 2004, he talked about even greater automation
where they won't even be reading the ZIP-code.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the way -- I'm
telling you I assume the way it works is that the UPS
truck goes out to the tobacco warehouse and picks up
,000 boxes, all registered tobacco. He certainly knows
it's tobacco at that point.
MS. BRINKMANN: That's not my understanding.
That's not the evidence in this case. There are many
ways in which the system comes in; and I certainly think
that could be a different question of knowing and that
would be a question of proof.
And it can be evidence. But I'll tell you,
if there was a driver who for the past month had found
three boxes of tobacco and turned them in and said, you
know, these can't be delivered, and one day one box got
through and he didn't see it written, or it was written
in light marker or it had, you know, bled, because they
used the wrong thing -- there's no uniformity of size or
anything -- no, I think that would be a question for a
jury to decide about knowledge, and it can't be a
presumption and it can't be deemed. It is a question of
knowledge.
JUSTICE BREYER: May I ask you this
question, which is where I'm having a little trouble on
your side. I think I would agree and you would agree
that if the State were to say, to protect the consumers
in our State, anyone who ships in goods must do so in
special padded cars -- use whatever shipper you want,
but you have to have special -- that would be illegal.
MS. BRINKMANN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can California say, anybody
who ships lettuces into our State has to use
refrigerated equipment? One product, not all products,
and a good public health reason?
MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, that would be
for Congress, and it would have --
JUSTICE BREYER: So you'd say that would
also be preempted?
MS. BRINKMANN: I think you have to look at
the specific statute. And we went through and really
looked at the statutes that the State cited, and you can
see in our brief we set out, a third of them have
knowledge requirements. Another group -- for example
Maine's fireworks, when you trace it down, it looks like
a local commissioner does it, and then they adopt these
standards for an association. And what is it? It's a
Federal standard. So I think you really have to bore
into that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is it that knowledge
requirements have a different preemption analysis?
That's what I'm finding that difficult to understand.
MS. BRINKMANN: Because the way in which the
First Circuit construed the first sentence is just to be
a ban on knowing transportation delivery, and said it
can't require -- on pages 26 and 27, it says it
different ways -- that if a liability standard of a
State is preempted, if, for example, it required
modification of the delivery methods, other than
declining the package; if in the normal course of the
services that are already provided, if there is
knowledge that is evidence --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then that's clear
preemption in Justice Breyer's example. If California
says you must ship certain products in refrigerated
containers, that is definitely preempted under your
analysis.
MS. BRINKMANN: If there is no Federal
regulatory -- yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That statute is definitely
preemptive. A State cannot insist on that. Could they
insist on firearms being slipped only in labeled
packages?
MS. BRINKMANN: There are many Federal
regulations about the transportation --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Could the State do it
beyond the Federal requirement?
MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, it would
have to be uniform, and I think that's a great example.
The -- the Federal scheme for hazardous materials are
extensive, and that is what carriers are focused on, on
uniformity, on the best way in which to provide these
services.
If I could, I just wanted to discuss for a
moment why we really would urge that there is no health
and safety exception or that this can be read to be
limited to economics. First of all --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get into that,
do we have to hold -- assuming we agree with you -- do
we have to hold that the knowing requirement of the
first sentence is okay?
MS. BRINKMANN: No, I don't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- even though the other
provisions are not okay?
MS. BRINKMANN: We did not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: : Okay. I have a lot of
trouble with the knowing requirement.
MS. BRINKMANN: We do not cross-petition on
that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Fifty different States
having a knowing requirement for a hundred different
products -- I don't know that that complies with the
Federal law.
MS. BRINKMANN: What we are responding to is
the cert petition from the State here. I would point
out that -- an example that the Court itself gave is
under their health and safety exemption, that means that
the State could come and just put a surcharge, whether
it would be on tobacco or junk food. There is no line
to draw between the position they take here and that
kind of situation. We point to the text of the statute,
of course, and the findings about the burdens on
interstate commerce of the interstate regulation. The
structure -- there is a facie exemption for motor
vehicles and even that has a Department of
Transportation Federal backdrop against it. And in the
Morales opinion from this Court, they pointed to the
Airline Deregulation Act, which is very important here
because that statute is construed just as this is. And
in the Morales the Court pointed out that an earlier
bill had had the kind of economic regulation that the
State here seeks and it was rejected. Then of course in
this very case, the Congress -- conference report
embraced the Morales standard and in fact described it
as a broad preemptive standard they intended apply here.
So we believe that that is the standard that should
really apply, but in light of the effect that this has
on the carrier services, we suggest it means any
standard of or are related to.
There's certainly an immediate connection
with -- and there are express references in these
provisions that we suggest means any preemption
standard.
If there's -- one other thing I would say,
up the C(3)(C), the provision which the State suggests
does not directly dictate services, first of all the
Solicitor General reads the statute anew and suggests
that there may be direct enforcement against the
carriers, which certainly would changes our view of
that, because there is an instruction requirement that
the shipper give to the carrier and say, State law
mandates this.
Moreover, we would like to point out, for
example, in the Wolens case, the frequent flyers program
that was at issue there was not a mandatory aspect of
the services, and also in the Court's own recent Clean
Air Act case, where there's also the "relating to"
language used. Engine manufacturers realize this, that
you can't regulate the seller through the purchaser.
Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Ms. Brinkmann.
Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER,
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
I think there's no question that the
State of Maine could not require carriers to obtain a
license to deliver tobacco products and condition that
upon the carrier's service complying with the mandates
of State law, that that would be a law that relates to
the carrier's service.
Now, Maine maintains that its law is
saved from preemption because of two distinctions: One,
it that is adopted with a health rather than economic
purpose, and because it operates directly on the shipper
rather than the carrier.
And we don't think that either of those
arguments is consistent with the text, structure, or
legislative history of the Act. But I would want to
point --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about
the Federal act or the Maine act?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The Federal act.
That's right. But it's worth noting that those
arguments, in any event, only go to the provision in
C(3)(C). The provision that is under dispute in section
D does not have either of those characteristics. It
operates directly on the carrier, and it is not adopted
for the health concern but rather to support the State's
licensing and tax purposes.
But if I could go back to the reasons why
their argument is inconsistent with the text, structure,
and history of the Federal act, as Respondents' counsel
noted, Congress did consider an alternative version of
this bill, one that was limited to economic regulation,
and the Congress rejected the Senate version and adopted
instead the House version that much more broadly
pre-empted State regulation related to carrier services.
It added the provision of services and adopted the
"related to" standard rather than regulation.
And so it has rejected this limitation that
Petitioners urge. Moreover, the argument that there is
a general health exception to the pre-emptive force of
the FAAAA is inconsistent with the structure of the Act.
There are specific exceptions in the Act related, for
example, to motor carrier safety, but those exceptions
correspond to other grants of authority to the Secretary
of Transportation to adopt regulations and to pre-empt
State regulations that would interfere with interstate
commerce or impose too much of a burden on interstate
commerce.
There is no similar back top, if the court
reads into the FAAAA a textual general exception for any
act adopted with a health purpose by the States.
JUSTICE ALITO: If one of the big carriers
decides for its own business purposes to offer a service
that complied with the Maine law, would that have the
effect of "un-pre-empting" the Maine law?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, what Congress
-- what Congress had in mind in the Act was that
carriers would respond to the marketplace, not State
regulation. And where a service is widely available in
response to the marketplace, for a State to dictate to
shippers that they should use one service as opposed to
another, we think would have -- it would be a different
analysis under Morales. The Court in Morales said that
the test was whether there was a significant effect on
the carriers.
And where, as here, we have the three major
carriers all providing, for example, an
adult-signature-required service, for the -- for a State
to say, well, when you ship alcohol, you have to use
that available service, that would not have much of an
effect at all on the carriers.
JUSTICE ALITO: Even if the law --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In fact, the
Federal law --
JUSTICE ALITO: Even if they all now decided
they wanted to go into this business, that would have no
effect because they would have done that to comply with
the Maine law rather than as -- in response to the
marketplace?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. We
don't think the State can adopt a law and in a sense
force the carriers to conform their services to the
State law and then say, oh, but now they have it. We
don't think that would be conducive --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me rather odd
that major carriers can determine the scope of
pre-emption. Suppose there are smaller carriers that
say we don't want to do this. Take the New York
settlement example. If the New York settlement example,
in effect, opens up a new kind of service, all other
carriers have to follow that? That's a -- there's no
authority in our cases for that kind of pre-emption
analysis, is there?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I think with
respect to this particular example about the adult
signature required, the Court probably would need to go
no farther than the fact that the Federal government has
itself recognized the existence of that service and
required it in a law that relates to the shipping of
wine when one is prohibited by safety regulations from
taking it on the airplane with them. So the existence
in the marketplace of this service has already
recognized in Federal law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I follow up on
Justice Kennedy's question, though, and specifically, do
you think the New York settlement, if the carriers did
not agree to it, that they would nonetheless prevail
because the terms of it are pre-emptive?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I have not studied
the New York statute sufficiently to speak to that, and
I don't think the government has a position about that.
We do believe -- the settlement agreement, though, is
distinct from the Maine law in some very significant
respects.
And the most important of those is that
under the settlement agreement, the carriers agree to
use reasonable best efforts; whereas the Maine
provision -- this is the second sentence of D -- deems
the carrier to have knowledge --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, see, you are
-- you are pretty familiar with the New York settlement
then.
(Laughter.)
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I have some
familiarity with it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then I think
you ought to be able to tell me whether you think it's
pre-empted by the Federal law under your theory or not.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I -- Your
Honor, we have not taken a position on whether the
settlement is and, with respect -- although I have
familiarity with the settlement, I have less familiarity
with the underlying New York statute that it was agreed
to, in response to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you have
familiarity with the knowing delivery requirement here.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that pre-emptive
under your view?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In our view, where,
as construed by the First Circuit -- and we sort of
accept that view -- the First Circuit, on page 26 of the
Pet. App., construed the first sentence of D as
requiring that carriers do not act as knowing
accomplices in the illegal sale of tobacco products. So
construed, we don't believe that that provision is
pre-emptive. It is akin to the general prohibition on
furnishing tobacco to minors in 1555-B(2), and we don't
think that that provision is pre-emptive.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You mean it's akin to the
health exception.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Excuse me.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You say it's akin to a
health exception.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. I -- I say
that it is a law of general applicability, and it does
not require any change in the carriers' practices. What
-- what the imputation of knowledge does, however, is
require the carriers to change their practices so that
they will get the knowledge when they can. For example,
take another example. If Maine said that it would
impute knowledge to the carriers of the tobacco contents
if an X-ray scan would reveal the cigarette contents, it
would in effect be requiring the carriers to install
X-ray machines and pass every package that they get
through those X-ray machines. That's how an
imputation of knowledge can be used to direct the
conduct of the carrier, and that's what is so
problematic about the second sentence of D. They impute
knowledge based upon whether the name of the shipper
appears on a confidential list that the attorney general
has provided. In other words, even though, in their
normal practices, they don't pay attention whatsoever to
the shipper's name, they have to incorporate that into
their practices in order to avoid the imputation of
knowledge.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the first condition,
and the package is clearly labeled, aren't there some
commodities where UPS does have to pay attention to the
label?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, yes, Your
Honor. A Federal law -- there is Federal law with
respect to shipment of hazardous substances. There are
uniform requirements with respect to how one must label
hazardous substances, but --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It can't be --
Ms. Brinkmann told us that they've got these -- so many
packages and it's going to cost millions. But they do
have to do it for a package that's labeled hazardous.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, as I
understand it, the -- the uniformity of the symbol for
hazardous substance is something that the handlers are
trained to scan for.
JUSTICE ALITO: But won't the name of the
shipper be in their computer program? I mean, the
shipper has to pay, right? Well, they know the name of
the shipper --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well --
JUSTICE ALITO -- and they have a
supercomputer so I don't understand why not
necessarily --
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Not necessarily, as
I understand the service. Some of -- many, many of the
packages are delivered to a company with which UPS has a
contract, such as a Staples or some other kind of store.
And it becomes -- the Staples store becomes the shipper.
They are the ones with the contract with UPS, not
whoever it was that brought to it Staples. So it is not
necessarily part of their practice that they would have
that information at all.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.
Mr. Stern, you have five minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL STERN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STERN: Thank you, Your Honor.
Beginning with the last series of questions,
if the Court looks at pages 100 to 102 of the joint
appendix, the Court will see that UPS has a computer
dial-up system which allows it to keep track of, and
provide alerts for, shippers' addresses and consignees,
as well as they can keep track of what is called an SIC
code which is with respect to commodities. And they can
keep track of tobacco commodities.
There seems to be a misconception here, and
I apologize for that. Maine's law is not a criminal
law. It provides for civil violations between $50 and,
I think, $1500.
Regarding quantification, the only hard
evidence in the record is that it costs UPS less than
one cents a -- one cent a package to look at the label
to determine whether a -- a particular name is
problematic or not.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Times 50.
MR. STERN: Excuse me.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Times 50, because 49 other
States would have different requirements, and all those
requirements might -- might cost only a penny to comply
with. But you add them all up, and it is half a buck.
MR. STERN: No, it is not, Your Honor.
Because, as Ms. Brinkmann explained, the -- the looking
at the label is done usually in UPS's situation by a
preloader. And the preloader is in the particular
State. So it still would be less than one cent a State
for each State it happened to be in.
The $2 a package is for the actual
intercepted packages. In a five-month period, there
were a total of 33 intercepted packages, and the
citation to the record is at page 106.
By no stretch of the imagination is there
any proof in this record that it costs $32 million a
year to comply with Maine's law.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Stern, when you say
that it takes one second to -- I forget whether you said
scan or -- or examine a label, do you -- are you
describing simply the physical act of a human being
looking at the label?
MR. STERN: According to the testimony of
Mr. Butler, who provided a document on this, it is
looking at the label and determining whether it appears
to be from a tobacco retailer.
JUSTICE SOUTER: You can't tell unless you
have an extraordinary memory for all the names on the
Attorney General's list. You can't do that simply by
looking at the label.
And I -- I thought maybe what you meant by
the one second was that the list was -- was in a
computer, and you had a mechanical device that scanned
the -- the name on the label and -- and it either
matched something in the computer, or it didn't.
But I take it you are talking about
physical, visual inspection.
MR. STERN: Yes. Your Honor's question
raises two points. First, with respect to the names,
if one goes and looks at the list of unlicensed tobacco
retailers, virtually all of them have something like
"tobacco" or "smokes" or something in it, because their
goal is to be picked up by a Google search for somebody
who is looking for cheap cigarettes and cheap tobacco.
With respect to the computer system -- and
the record is full of citations to it, for example, at
pages 92 and 95 -- they have done a study of their
computer system. They have not attempted in any way to
research whether any of the companies on the list of
unlicensed retailers is actually in their system so they
can be picked up by the system.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I -- I just wanted to
know what you meant by the "one second." I take it what
you mean is there is a physical, visual inspection of
the label. And in that one second, in practical terms,
the person looking can tell whether the name is on the
Attorney General's list, because there will be some
tipoff in the -- in the name of the company that -- that
will alert him?
MR. STERN: Yes. And if it is, it is put
aside. And those are the 33 packages that were
intercepted in a five-month period that cost --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But --
MR. STERN: -- UPS $2 a package.
JUSTICE SOUTER: If someone on the
unapproved list wants to -- for whatever reason, wants
to avoid a tipoff term like incorporating the term
"tobacco" on to their label, then the person making the
one-second inspection is not going to pick it up.
And the only way the company is going to be
able to protect itself against the imputed knowledge is
either by a visual inspection of the Attorney General's
list to see whether it matches what the person is
looking at or by some computer scan, right?
MR. STERN: The short answer is yes. If I
can explain?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.
MR. STERN: The -- the way UPS goes about
dealing with this law was to put together a system which
Ms. Brinkmann and I have described. They did not study
in any way, shape, or form how their computer system
could streamline this and make it effective.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stern, I'd be
interested in whether you have any response to the
Government's point that, at least as far as 1555-D is
concerned, that is a direct regulation of -- of the --
the shipper -- not the shipper, of the transporter. So
that -- so that your point that this is not a regulation
of -- of transport is simply -- is simply wrong as far
as 1555-D is concerned. Do you acknowledge that?
MR. STERN: Yes. We made that point with
respect to 1555-C (3)(C).
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.
MR. STERN: With respect to 1555-D, it is a
direct regulation of the carrier services or any other
