CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 12-398, Association for
Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics.
Mr. Hansen?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER A. HANSEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HANSEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
One way to address the question presented by
this case is what exactly did Myriad invent? And the
answer is nothing.
Myriad unlocked the secrets of two human
genes. These are genes that correlate with an increased
risk of breast or ovarian cancer. But the genes
themselves, their -- where they start and stop, what
they do, what they are made of, and what happens when
they go wrong are all decisions that were made by
nature, not by Myriad.
Now, Myriad deserves credit for having
unlocked these secrets. Myriad does not deserve a
patent for it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hansen, Respondents
say that isolating or extracting natural products, that
has long been considered patentable, and give --
examples were aspirin and whooping cough vaccine. How
is this different from -- those start with natural --
natural products.
MR. HANSEN: Well, in -- in essence, Your
Honor, everything starts with a natural product. And
this Court has said repeatedly that just extracting a
natural product is insufficient. For example, this
Court has used the example of gold. You can't patent
gold because it's a natural product.
The examples that you cite all involve
further manipulation of a product of nature, so that the
product of nature is no longer what it was in nature;
it's become something different. And in many instances
has taken on a new function.
But --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you dispute that
you can patent, however, a process for extracting
naturally-occurring things?
MR. HANSEN: Of course. I think that is
totally acceptable. And what's interesting in this case
is, the process that Myriad uses to extract the genes is
not at issue in this case. It's a process that's used
by geneticists every day all over this country. It is
routine, conventional science.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So isn't that -- why
isn't that a way to, in effect, have patent protection
for the product? Does somebody who wants to use the
product, the DNA -- extracted DNA in this case, have to
find a new process from -- to extract it if they want to
have it available?
MR. HANSEN: Well, the -- the process by
which it's extracted is now very routine.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no -- yes, I
know. I'm assuming it isn't, that they discover this
process and it leads to a -- a particular product. Does
anybody who wants to use the product either have to get
a license for the process or find a different way of
extracting it?
MR. HANSEN: I think they have to find a
different way of extracting it, in the same way that
finding a method of extracting gold does entitle you to
a patent on the method of extracting gold, it may also
entitle you to a patent on the use of gold. For
example, if you find a new way of using gold to make
earrings, or if you find a new way of using DNA to do
something, you may be entitled to a patent on that
because --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me why
their test wasn't given a patent? I know the method of
extraction wasn't, and why. Why would the tests --
would the tests be subject to a patent?
MR. HANSEN: The tests are also routine and
conventional science, but in this particular case, there
were some method claims that we challenged. The method
claims in this case involved taking the genes that you
extracted from the woman and the gene that you -- the
way you think it should be, and simply looking back and
forth to see if they're the same or different. And the
Federal Circuit that -- found that that was an abstract
idea and not patentable.
And, in fact, that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm curious as to why
the methodology of extracting the gene has not been
patented. You say everybody -- everybody uses it. Why
wasn't that patented?
MR. HANSEN: The original -- the original
methodology was patented, and is -- is patentable. In
fact, if they came up with a new process, it would be
patentable. But it has -- but that -- it has been very
freely licensed. In fact, the patent may now have
expired. And so it's used all over the country every
day.
JUSTICE ALITO: Can I take you back to -- to
Justice Ginsburg's question because I'm -- I don't --
I'm not sure you got at what troubles me about that.
Suppose there is a substance, a -- a
chemical, a molecule in the -- the leaf -- the leaves of
a plant that grows in the Amazon, and it's discovered
that this has tremendous medicinal purposes. Let's say
it -- it treats breast cancer.
A new discovery, a new way -- a way is
found, previously unknown, to extract that. You make a
drug out of that. Your answer is that cannot be
patent -- patented, it's not eligible for patenting
because the chemical composition of the -- of the drug
is the same as the chemical that exists in the leaves of
the plant.
MR. HANSEN: If there is no alteration, if
we simply pick the leaf off of the tree and swallow it
and it has some additional value, then I think it is not
patentable. You might be able to get a method patent on
it, you might be able to get a use patent on it, but you
can't get a composition patent.
But as --
JUSTICE ALITO: But you're making -- you
keep making the hypotheticals easier than they're
intended to be. It's not just the case of taking the
leaf off the tree and chewing it. Let's say if you do
that, you'd have to eat a whole forest to get the -- the
value of this. But it's extracted and -- and reduced to
a concentrated form. That's not patent -- that's not
eligible?
MR. HANSEN: No, that may well be eligible
because you have now taken what was in nature and you've
transformed it in two ways. First of all, you've made
it substantially more concentrated than it was in
nature; and second, you've given it a function. If it
doesn't work in the diluted form but does work in a
concentrated form, you've given it a new function. And
the -- by both changing its nature and by giving it a
new function, you may well have patent --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, when you concede that,
then I'm not sure how you distinguish the isolated DNA
here because it has a different function. Will you
dispute that? Isolated DNA has a very different
function from the DNA as it exists in nature. And
although the chemical composition may not be different,
it -- it certainly is in a different form. So what is
the distinction?
MR. HANSEN: Well, I don't think it has a
new function, Your Honor, with respect. I believe that
what -- Myriad has proffered essentially three functions
for the DNA outside the body as opposed to inside the
body. The first is we can look at it. And that's true,
but that's not really a new function. That's simply the
nature of when you extract something you can look at it
better.
The second two rationales that Myriad has
proffered are that it can be used as probes and primers.
Three of the -- three of lower court judges found that
full-length DNA, which all of these patent claims
include, cannot be used as probes and primers. But more
important, finding a new use for a product of nature, if
you don't change the product of nature, is not
patentable. If I find a new way of taking gold and
making earrings out of it, that doesn't entitle me to a
patent on gold. If I find a new way of using lead, it
doesn't entitle me to a new -- to a patent on lead.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: From what you know and
from what the record shows, would the process of tagging
the isolated DNA be patentable? The process of tagging,
we just don't know about that or is there a patent on
that?
MR. HANSEN: The very patents in this case
include claims on -- on DNA that is tagged so that it
can be used as a probe. We have not challenged that.
We are not asking the Court to strike down that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under our -- our law, is a
patent ever divisible so that if it's valid in part but
invalid in another part, it can still stand as to the
part?
MR. HANSEN: No, it is not permissible under
patent law to do essentially a narrowing -- narrowing
construction of the -- of the claim.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you haven't
challenged this, then -- then where are we with respect
to the tagging? I don't quite understand. Because
the -- the entire patent, which includes tagging, would
fail under your argument.
MR. HANSEN: Oh, I'm sorry, no. I
misunderstood. The claims that we are challenging do
not -- are not limited to tagging, are not limited to
use as probes. There are other claims that we are not
challenging that are limited to probes. Those would
remain, but the -- but the claims that we're challenging
would in fact be struck down because they're not so
limited. In fact --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then -- then explain
when you said you can't narrow. You said earlier you
can't narrow.
MR. HANSEN: Yes. If a claim reaches
something that is both impermissible and permissible,
it -- the claim is invalid, period.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right, that
individual claim is invalid.
MR. HANSEN: That individual claim.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the patent with
respect to claims that are not invalid would still
stand.
MR. HANSEN: That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The primers and probes
stand.
MR. HANSEN: Would -- would still remain.
Even if you were to rule for Petitioners, you would not
have to rule concerning the use of DNA as a probe or a
primer.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Hansen, could you tell
me what you think the incentives are for a company to do
what Myriad did? If you assume that it takes a lot of
work and takes a lot of investment to identify this
gene, but the gene is not changed in composition, and
what you just said is that discovering uses for that
gene would not be patentable, even if those new -- even
if those uses are new, what does Myriad get out of this
deal? Why shouldn't we worry that Myriad or companies
like it will just say, well, you know, we're not going
to do this work anymore?
MR. HANSEN: Well, we know that would not
have happened in this particular case, Your Honor. We
know that there were other labs looking for the BRCA
genes and they had announced that they would not patent
them if they were the first to find it. We also know
that prior to the patent actually being issued, there
were other labs doing BRCA testing and Myriad shut all
that testing down. So we know in this particular case
that problem would not have arisen.
But the point of the whole -- the whole
point of the product of nature doctrine is that when you
lock up a product of nature, it prevents industry from
innovating and -- and making new discoveries. It --
that's the reason we have the product of nature
doctrine, is because there may be a million things you
can do with the BRCA gene, but nobody but Myriad is
allowed to look at it and that is impeding science
rather than advancing science.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you still haven't
answered her question. Why? Why would a company incur
massive investment if it -- if it cannot patent?
MR. HANSEN: Well, taxpayers paid for much
of the investment in Myriad's work, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're still not answering
the question.
MR. HANSEN: But -- yeah. But I think
scientists look for things for a whole variety of
reasons, sometimes because they're curious about the
world as a whole, sometimes because --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Curiosity is your answer.
JUSTICE KAGAN: I thought you were going
to --
MR. HANSEN: Sometimes because they want a
Nobel Prize. Sometimes --
JUSTICE KAGAN: I thought you were going to
say something else, Mr. Hansen, and I guess I -- I hoped
you were going to say something else, which is that,
notwithstanding that you can't get a patent on this
gene, that -- that there are still, you know, various
things that you could get a patent on that would make
this kind of investment worthwhile, in the usual case.
But if that's the case, I want to know what those things
are rather than you're just saying, you know, we're
supposed to leave it to scientists who want Nobel
Prizes.
And I agree that there are those scientists,
but there are also, you know, companies that do
investments in these kinds of things that you hope won't
just shut them down.
MR. HANSEN: Let me give a specific example
that may be helpful in doing a better job of answering
the question. One of the -- one of the amici has
worried a lot about whether a decision for the
Petitioners in this case would invalidate recombinant
DNA. Recombinant DNA is in fact what all the major
innovations in industry are doing these days. It's
DNA where the scientist decides the sequence rather than
nature deciding the sequence.
There is nothing in our position that would
prevent recombinant DNA from being patented, but there
is -- it is the cases that if the patents are upheld,
recombinant DNA is frustrated.
People can't use pieces of the BRCA gene to
recombine them and find new treatments and find new
diagnoses and find new things that will advance medicine
and science as a result of these patents. It's a
perfect example of what the point of the product of
nature doctrine is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. But, of course, to
profit from -- from that recombinant DNA, you have to
not just isolate the gene, but then you have to do
something with it afterwards. So you really haven't
given us a reason why somebody would try to isolate the
gene.
MR. HANSEN: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, sure, yes, I can do
stuff with it afterwards, but so can everybody else.
What advantage do I get from being the person that or
the company that isolated that -- that gene. You say
none at all.
MR. HANSEN: No, I think you get enormous
recognition, but I don't think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's lovely.
MR. HANSEN: But I think that we know that
that's sufficient. We know it's sufficient with respect
to these two genes. We also know it's sufficient with
respect to the human genome project.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure the
Court can decide the case on -- on that basis. I'm sure
that there are substantial arguments in the amicus brief
that this investment is necessary and that -- and that
makes sense. To say, oh, well, the taxpayers will do
it, don't worry, is, I think, an insufficient answer.
As Justice Kagan's follow-up questions
indicated, I thought you might say, well, there are
process patents that they can have, that this is
sufficient.
MR. HANSEN: And that's certainly true.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I just don't
think we can decide the case on the ground, oh, don't
worry about investment, it'll come. I -- I just don't
think we can do that. It may be that the law allows you
to prevail on the fact that this is -- occurs in nature
and there's nothing new here, but that's quite
different.
MR. HANSEN: And it is certainly true, as
Your Honor suggests, that one of the incentives here is
a process patent or a development patent. If you -- if
you've isolated the gene and you find a new use for it,
you could get a patent on the new use for the patent.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the whole point,
isn't it? The isolation itself is not valuable, it's
the use you put the isolation to. That's the answer,
isn't it?
MR. HANSEN: That's exactly correct. Thank
you. Yes, that is the answer.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so that is the
answer, which is in isolation it has no value. It's
just nature sitting there.
MR. HANSEN: Interestingly, it has one
value. And that is you can look at it to see if there's
a mutation in it. And when you find a mutation in the
isolated gene, you write back to the woman who provided
the sample and you say to her because the isolated gene
is the same as the gene in your body, I can tell you
that there's a mutation in your body.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a failure of the
patent law. It doesn't patent ideas.
MR. HANSEN: And it shouldn't patent ideas,
and -- but it also makes the point that isolated gene
and the gene in the body are the same.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go to -- can we
go to cDNA a moment?
MR. HANSEN: Sure.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is artificially
created in the laboratory, so it's not bound in nature.
It's not taking a gene and snipping something that's in
nature. And yet you claim that can't be patented. The
introns are taken out, the exons are left in, and
they're sequenced together. Give me your argument on
that. I read your brief, but it is not a product of
nature, it's a product of human invention.
MR. HANSEN: There are two big differences
between cDNA and DNA. The first is exactly the one Your
Honor just discussed, which is that the introns, the
noncoding regions, have been removed. That is done in
the body, by the body. That's done in the process of
DNA going to mRNA.
What the scientist does who's creating the
cDNA is they take the mRNA out of the body and then they
simply have the natural nature-driven nucleotide binding
processes complement the mRNA. So that if the mRNA has
a C, the scientist just puts a -- the corresponding
nucleotide in there and nature causes them to bind up.
The scientist does not decide --
JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I don't see the
answer because I gather, if I -- if I've read it
correctly, that when you have an R -- the messenger RNA
does not have the same base pairs. There's a U or
something instead of an A or whatever it is.
MR. HANSEN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: So when you actually look,
if you could get a super-microscope and look at what
they have with the cDNA, with their cDNA, you would
discover something with an A, not a U. Is it AU? Is
that the one?
MR. HANSEN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Okay. So -- so you
would discover something with an A there, you see, and
you wouldn't discover something with a U there. And
there is no such thing in nature as the no-introns AGG,
whatever, okay? It's not there. That's not truly
isolated DNA. But you can go look up the Amazon,
wherever you want. Hence the question. Now, on that
one, how? How is that found in nature? The answer is
it isn't.
MR. HANSEN: Well, but I would suggest, Your
Honor, that the question is not whether it is identical
to something in nature. The question is whether there
was a human invention involved, whether it is markedly
different from what is found in nature.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that goes to
obviousness. That does not in my mind go to the issue
of whether it's patent eligible. You may have a very
strong argument on obviousness, but why does it not --
it's creating something that's not found in nature at
all.
MR. HANSEN: The sequence of the nucleotides
is dictated by nature. The order that they go in is
dictated by nature.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's a separate
question --
MR. HANSEN: It is true --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- about whether this
claim is too expansive because it's claiming every 15
nucleotides and nature produces 15 randomly. But
assuming the claim was for the entire mutated gene and
not the small snippet that they want to capture the
whole gene with, that's -- that whole gene without the
introns is just not found in nature.
MR. HANSEN: It is not -- the -- the exons
with the exact same composition and in the exact same
order are found in nature, and the question is whether
when the body removes the introns, has the body made
something markedly different than what is in nature, and
it is our view --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: When I first looked at
this case, I -- I thought that maybe the cDNA was kind
of an economy class gene, was -- it wasn't. But my
understanding is that it may have a functionality that
the -- the DNA isolate does not, easier to tag, et
cetera. That may be incorrect for the record, but that
was my present understanding.
MR. HANSEN: It is somewhat easier to work
with cDNA to make recombinant DNA, and it's recombinant
DNA that is the place where all of the innovation and
all the efforts are taking place. And if we lock up --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is all the tagging done on
recombinant DNA?
MR. HANSEN: All of the change -- all of the
useful things that we are inventing is done -- is done
through the process of recombinant DNA. And if we lock
up the cDNA, it makes it harder to do the recombinant
DNA. So that if someone owns all the cDNA, I can't do
recombinant DNA using what the company owns.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hansen, you answered
my initial question by saying they start -- everything
starts with a national -- natural product, but these
others, the examples that I gave, you said they involve
manipulation. The -- the cDNA can't be characterized as
involving manipulation?
MR. HANSEN: It certainly -- there's --
there is some manipulation, although it's -- it's
letting nature manipulate, not doing -- not the
scientist manipulating. But it -- what the other factor
that distinguishes aspirin and the other examples you
use from cDNA is that they have -- the alteration of the
substance has also altered the function, and cDNA has
exactly the same function as DNA with the exception of
Justice Kennedy's, that it's easier to use with.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you -- you've really
lost me when you say that it's nature that does the
alteration rather than the scientist. I mean, whenever
a scientist does an alteration, he does it, you know, by
some force of nature.
MR. HANSEN: No --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, he doesn't do it
unnaturally, does he? I mean, there's some --
MR. HANSEN: Well, let me try an analogy,
Your Honor, that might be helpful. In our view, it's
like Funk Brothers in the sense that the five bacteria
in Funk Brothers didn't sit together in nature.
The scientists took them and put them
together in nature. Here the scientist takes the exons
and lets the natural processes of the body put them
together in -- in the laboratory. It's exactly the same
as Funk Brothers.
If I could reserve the remainder of my time,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask a question, which
I don't think will be taken from your time.
MR. HANSEN: Sure, of course.
JUSTICE BREYER: But I have to ask you this.
Look, you say don't reach the cDNA issue and the reason
is because of the nature of the claim. Okay, I look at
their claim. Their claim says they want, "the isolated
DNA of claim 1 wherein said DNA has the nucleotide
sequence set forth in SEQ ID No. 1."
Then we turn to that and the first thing it
says right there is it says, "The molecule involved
is" -- "Molecule type: cDNA." And then it has a long
list and that long list is a list of the basis, okay.
So molecule type, cDNA. So they say what do
you mean they aren't claiming cDNA? That's what they
say they're claiming.
MR. HANSEN: No --
JUSTICE BREYER: Because of the word
"wherein." So I go back to the "wherein" in Prometheus
and the "wherein" -- you read "wherein" as in context,
and in this context you mean to say that a person who
makes isolated DNA that has lots of introns in it as
well as the sequence is going to be an infringer under
claim 2?
MR. HANSEN: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any support for
that other than the treatise that you cited?
MR. HANSEN: There --
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I looked at that
and it said read the "wherein" depending on context.
MR. HANSEN: Well, that certainly --
JUSTICE BREYER: And then depending on --
okay. Then you got -- you heard what I said, so I want
to know is there anything else I should read?
MR. HANSEN: Yes. The other support for it
is the definition of the DNA in the patent itself, which
we cite, which says that whenever we use the term "DNA"
we mean both.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I saw that. I saw
that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. HANSEN: Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Verrilli?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY
GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
Enforcing the distinction between human
invention and a product of nature preserves a necessary
balance in the patent system between encouraging
individual inventors and keeping the basic building
blocks of innovation free for all to use. Isolated DNA
falls on the ineligible side of that divide because it
is simply native DNA extracted from the body. The claim
that it is a --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are we fighting over
nothing? Are you fighting over nothing? If -- if they
can patent this cDNA in the way they have, what does it
matter, since it appears as if research has to rely on
the cDNA to be effective?
GENERAL VERRILLI: I actually think that --
I think we're -- we're fighting about something of
importance. That question gets right to it. I want to
answer the question directly, Your Honor. I'd like to
make a prefatory point before doing so.
The claim that isolated DNA is a human
invention rests entirely on the fact that it is no
longer connected at the molecular level to what
surrounded it in the body. But allowing a patent on
that basis would effectively preempt anyone else from
using the gene itself for any medical or scientific
purpose. That is not true about a patent on cDNA. A
patent on cDNA leaves the isolated DNA available for
other scientists and other -- and others in the medical
profession to try to generate new uses.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Hansen -- Mr. Hansen
just said that to do recombinant technology, you have to
use the cDNA rather than the native D -- the isolated
DNA. Do you disagree with that?
GENERAL VERRILLI: That's not my
understanding, Justice Kagan. My understanding is that
you -- that the native DNA can be used for recombinant
DNA without the step of cDNA. We do think cDNA is
important and the position of the United States is that
cDNA is patent eligible. We disagree --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose his
understanding is correct. Suppose your
misunderstanding -- suppose your understanding is not
correct.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Our position, though, is
that cDNA is patent eligible because we don't -- we think,
unlike the isolated DNA which is just taken from your body,
cDNA is an artificial creation in the laboratory that
doesn't correspond to anything in your body.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mister -- General
Verrilli, I got the distinct impression from your brief
that your view was that, although the cDNA may be
patentable, it might very well be rejected as obvious.
GENERAL VERRILLI: That's true now, Justice
Ginsburg, but obviousness is determined at the time that
the patent is issued, so what may be true now might not
have been true at the time the patents were initially
issued. And --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I -- I thought
the basic general approach here was we have a very
expansive view of what is patent eligible and then we
narrow things through things -- issues like obviousness
and so on. Why -- wouldn't it make more sense to
address the questions at issue here in the obviousness
realm?
GENERAL VERRILLI: That's a little --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you got something
that's big, it seems to me pretty obvious that you could
take a smaller part of it. That the idea -- a smaller
part of something that's bigger is obvious. Now, yes,
you can have a patent on the process of extracting that
small part, but I don't understand how a small part of
something bigger isn't obvious. And if it is, I don't
understand why this -- these issues aren't addressed at
that stage.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think my answer
to that, I guess, Your Honor, would -- would point first
to Mayo, in which the Court recognized that the
threshold test under Section 101 for patent eligibility
does do work that the obviousness test and a novelty
test and a specification test do not do, and the work
that it does here, I would respectfully submit, is to
ensure that the natural substance, the product of nature
itself, is not subjected effectively to a monopoly
because if it can be deemed to be a human invention
solely as a result of the change that occurs when you
extract it from the body, then that means, as a -- as a
practical matter that you have granted a patent on the
gene itself because no one else can extract it because
extracting it is isolating it, isolating it violates the
patent.
And so as a result of that, no one else can
try to develop competing tests for breast cancer, no one
else can try to use this gene for recombinant DNA.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm -- I'm not sure
that's responsive to my concern. Your answer said well,
here are a lot of reasons why this shouldn't have patent
protection. My question goes to whether we ought to
focus on those reasons at the eligibility stage or at
the obviousness stage.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, the Court
identified in Chakrabarty and then reiterated in Mayo
that -- that it is -- that the right answer to that
question, Your Honor, is to focus on them at the
eligibility stage because the -- because getting the
balance right is of critical importance.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the issue here is a
very difficult one. It's one on which the government
has changed its position, isn't that correct?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO: It seems that there is
disagreement within the Executive Branch about it. This
case has been structured in an effort to get us to
decide this on the broadest possible ground, that
there's no argument, that it's just about 101, it's not
about any other provision of the Patent Act.
Why -- why should we -- why should we do
that? We have claims that if patent eligibility is
denied here it will prevent investments that are
necessary for the development of new drugs or it will
lead those who develop the new drugs to -- new
diagnostic techniques, to keep those secret, not
disclose them to the public. Why -- why should we jump
in and -- and decide the broadest possible question?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I would -- again, I
would point the Court to what the Court said last term
in Mayo, which is that the determination of patent
eligibility really is a double-edged sword.
And it may be that in a -- in a particular
case, maybe this case, although we are not expressing a
view on it, you could sort the issue out on some of the
other criteria, but that won't generally be true, and
the proposition of whether you can patent the gene
itself is a question we think of fundamental importance,
and it raises exactly the two-edged sword concern that
led the Court to conclude what it did in Mayo. And Mayo
was a situation very much -- I'm sorry.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, there's
an assertion made in Respondents' brief that the United
States would be in a singular position. That is, they
suggest that in every other industrialized nation this
could be subject -- could be patentable.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, and that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that so?
GENERAL VERRILLI: No. I think the picture
is much more complicated than that. In many other
nations it wouldn't be patentable and the patent law is
different from nation to nation.
I'll give one example I think helps
illustrate the point. In Germany and France, for
example, you can get a patent on isolated genomic DNA,
but only for a particular use. So you would get what is
the equivalent of a use patent, which is a patent that
we would think under our patent laws is acceptable, too.
If you -- just as with the question that
Justice Alito asked earlier about identifying a -- a
useful substance in a plant in the Amazon, if you
isolate that and it proves to have therapeutic effects,
you can get a patent on that use of it, but what you
can't do is get a patent on the substance itself so that
no one else can explore it for different uses and for --
and for different therapeutic purposes or to try to
recombine it and turn it into a -- an even more
therapeutic -- therapeutically valuable substance. And
that's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand why you are
saying cDNA is patentable as a subject matter. I am
looking at the way the claim is phrased, however, and it
says that it's patenting a DNA segment 15 nucleotides
long or longer. The reality is that 15 nucleotides
doesn't necessarily bridge a sequence that goes between
exons. It -- it can -- one exon can be 15 or more
sequences long. So are you arguing that this claim as
written is sustainable?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Your Honor, as a -- I am
going to invoke my privilege as an amicus in this
situation. I think that's a fight between the parties.
The point that we wanted to make is that as a conceptual
matter cDNA is patent eligible.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are not taking
the position that this claim as written is patentable?
GENERAL VERRILLI: That's right, Your Honor.
We're just saying as a conceptual matter that we think
cDNA is a creation of the lab, it's an artificial
creation, it's as a general matter patent eligible.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because as I understand
it, 15 nucleotides long exists naturally in nature.
They get reproduced in that sequence of 15.
GENERAL VERRILLI: That -- that may well be
right, Your Honor. As I said, we're not taking a
position on the particulars.
But if I -- just to return to the point that
Justice Alito made, the Court really was faced with a
similar situation in Mayo. On the one side you had
the -- the industry coming in and saying, look, we have
got a lot of reliance issue, PTO has issued more than
150,000 patents here. You are going to really disrupt
those reliance issues. On the other side you had the
American Medical Association, as you have here, coming
in and saying, actually, these patents inhibit much more
innovation than they incent.
And what the Court said is that -- as
Justice Kennedy alluded to earlier, that the Court's not
in a position to resolve that dispute conclusively. It
doesn't have the institutional wherewithal to do it.
But what the Court is in a position to do is to apply
the general principles of law as they were articulated
in Mayo, and then if there needs to be a particular
different set of rules for the biotech industry,
Congress can provide that different set of rules.
JUSTICE KAGAN: General Verrilli, could
I understand what you said because I think it might be a
little bit different from Mr. Hansen and I just want to
understand your position. You said that a company can't
get a -- a patent on the thing, but can get it on the
uses. So if I find this plant, let's say, in the Amazon
and I can't get a patent on the thing itself, but can I
get a patent when I discover that if you eat this plant
it has therapeutic effects?
GENERAL VERRILLI: May I answer briefly,
Mr. Chief Justice?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Briefly, please.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, you certainly can,
and that illustrates the difference. That patent is
just for the use, it doesn't tie up all other potential
uses of the substance and that's the key.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.
Mr. Castanias?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CASTANIAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
It is now 33 years after Chakrabarty,
31 years after the first isolated gene molecule patents
issued, and 12 years after the Patent and Trademark
Office issued its carefully reasoned Utility Guidelines
confirming that new isolated gene molecules are eligible
for patents. And it's almost 16 years after Myriad's
patents began to issue, Patents which -- yes?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that on the basis of
a new extraction process?
MR. CASTANIAS: On a -- a new extraction
process, no. Most of the processes are known. But
that's not relevant to patent eligibility or, for that
matter, patentability. As the last sentence, Justice
Sotomayor, of Section 103A says, "Patentability shall
not be negated by the manner in which the invention was
created."
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I have a sort of
analytical problem. I find it very, very difficult to
conceive how you can patent a sequential numbering
system by nature, in the same way that I have a problem
in thinking that someone could get a patent on the
computer binary code merely because they throw a certain
number of things on a piece of paper in a certain order.
I always thought that to have a patent you
had to take something and add to what nature does. So
how do you add to nature when all you are doing is
copying its sequence?
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, I guess I'll --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you add to it
besides process or use?
MR. CASTANIAS: Sure. Well, Justice
Sotomayor, I guess I'll take issue with the notion that
there is nothing additive here. What Myriad inventors
created in this circumstance was a new molecule that had
never before been known to the world. Now remember,
genes are themselves human constructs. And this points
up some of the serious analytical problems with the
Product of Nature Doctrine as the line-drawing exercise
that you've asked General Verrilli and Mr. Hansen to
engage in has illustrated.
The line-drawing is what is the product
of nature to start with? Is it me? Is it the genome?
Is it the chromosome? Is it the -- and the gene
ultimately --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Look, I can bake --
MR. CASTANIAS: -- is what was defined.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I can bake a chocolate
chip cookie using natural ingredients -- salt, flour,
eggs, butter -- and I create my chocolate chip cookie.
And if I combust those in some new way, I can get a
patent on that. But I can't imagine getting a patent
simply on the basic items of salt, flour and eggs,
simply because I've created a new use or a new product
from those ingredients.
MR. CASTANIAS: And that's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Explain to me --
MR. CASTANIAS: Sure.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- why gene sequences,
whether in the actual numbers, why gene sequences are
not those basic products that you can't patent.
MR. CASTANIAS: Okay. I'll start by -- by
showing you how this is actually a different structure.
It actually has an entirely different chemical name when
you give it the C --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the cDNA.
MR. CASTANIAS: No, no, no. That's
absolutely true with regard to the isolated molecule as
well. Because if you were to write it out in those --
those interminable chemical equations that we had to do
in high school, it's a "C" very different, "H" very
different.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I put salt and flour,
and that's different?
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, that is -- that is the
combination, yes, of two different things, and that's
sort of like -- that's sort of like --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if I take them apart,
now you can get a patent on the salt and now you can get
a patent on the flour?
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, they were apart
before, but they were both old. That's the problem
with using the really simplistic analogies, with all due
respect, Your Honor, about you know, like coal --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I guess --
MR. CASTANIAS: -- like leaves and that sort
of thing.
JUSTICE ALITO: Why is the chemical
composition in the isolated DNA different? You were
about to explain that.
MR. CASTANIAS: Yes, thank you,
Justice Alito. It -- it's got 5,914 nucleotides. The
genome itself has over 3 billion. It's arranged in the
way set forth -- as set forth in the SEQ IDs number 1
and 2. Number 2 is the so-called genomic DNA, SEQ ID
number 1 is the, as Justice Breyer understood, the cDNA
molecule.
When you look at those particular sequences,
there was invention in the decision of where to begin
the gene and where to end the gene. That was not given
by nature. In fact --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, well, well, well,
this is something I was going to ask you. I -- I assume
that it's true that -- that those abridged genes,
whatever you want to call them, do exist in the body.
That they do exist. You -- you haven't created a type
of gene that does -- does not exist in the body
naturally.
MR. CASTANIAS: But we've -- I'll -- I'll
use my own simplistic analogy which we offered in our
brief and which we offered to the lower court. A
baseball bat doesn't exist until it's isolated from a
tree. But that's still the product of human invention
to decide where to begin the bat and where to end the
bat.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true, but then
you were saying something that I just didn't understand
because I thought the -- the scientists who had filed
briefs here, as I read it, said it's quite true that the
chromosome has the BRCA gene in the middle of it and
it's attached to two ends.
But also in the body, perhaps because cells
die, there is isolated DNA. And that means that the DNA
strand, the chromosome strand is cut when a cell dies,
and then isolated bits get around, and there may be very
few of them in the world, but there are some, by the
laws of probability, that will in fact match precisely
the BRCA1 gene.
Now, have I misread what the scientists told
us, or are you saying that the scientists are wrong?
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, I will tell you
that --
JUSTICE BREYER: I probably misread it.
There's a better chance that I've misread it.
(Laughter.)
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, no, I think -- I think
you may have read some of the submissions correctly,
Justice Breyer. I think that's a question --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, which one have I not
read --
MR. CASTANIAS: I think that's a question of
some dispute in this record.
JUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, you're
saying that the Lander brief is wrong.
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, what I will tell
you --
JUSTICE BREYER: I want to know because I
have to admit that I read it and I did assume that as a
matter of science it was correct. So I would like to
know whether you agree, as a matter of science, that it
is correct, not of law, but of science, or if you are
disagreeing with it, as a matter of science.
MR. CASTANIAS: What I will tell you is that
what are called pseudogenes --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'd like a yes or no
answer.
MR. CASTANIAS: Yes. So the answer -- I
would say the answer is no because there is no
evidence --
JUSTICE BREYER: Was the answer no, you do
not disagree with it? I wonder, I disagree or I do
disagree?
MR. CASTANIAS: I do disagree with it with
the following --
JUSTICE BREYER: As a matter of science.
MR. CASTANIAS: As a matter of science with
the following -- okay.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Very well. If you
are saying it is wrong, as a matter of science, since
neither of us are scientists, I would like you to tell
me what I should read that will, from a scientist, tell
me that it's wrong.
MR. CASTANIAS: You want me to tell you
something from a scientist that you should read that
tells you that it is wrong?
JUSTICE BREYER: No -- yes -- I need to know --
MR. CASTANIAS: I think you could look at
the declaration in the -- the Joint Appendix for
Dr. Kay, for example. Dr. Kay's declaration appears
at -- starting at page 370. You'll find an extensive
discussion in there of the technology here and -- and of
the genetics.
But, Justice Breyer, just to explain the
finishing thought, what -- what Dr. Lander says in his
brief is that these pseudogenes, which are un --
undifferentiated fragments, exist in the body. What
hasn't been brought to the -- to the forefront is
something that is new and useful and available to the
public for -- for allowing women to determine whether
they have breast or ovarian --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I --
MR. CASTANIAS: -- mutations that are likely
to result in cancer.
Yes, Mr. Chief Justice?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to
your baseball bat example?
MR. CASTANIAS: Sure.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My understanding --
my understanding is that here, what's involved,
obviously through scientific processes, but we're not
talking about process. Here, what's involved is
snipping. You've got the thing there and you snip --
snip off the top and you snip off the bottom and there
you've got it.
The baseball bat is quite different. You
don't look at a tree and say, well, I've cut the branch
here and cut it here and all of a sudden I've got a
baseball bat. You have to invent it, if you will. You
don't have to invent the particular segment of the -- of
the strand, you just have to cut it off.
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, I -- I guess I'll even
take issue with that because the -- the story of how the
SEQ ID number 2, the genomic DNA segment came about is
exactly the opposite of that. If you look, for example,
at page 488 of the Joint Appendix, that's the
declaration of one of the inventors, Donna Shattuck, at
paragraph 27, what -- what she explains is that the
Myriad inventors first created the cDNA, which we agree
at least on that score with the Solicitor General, is
indeed eligible for patenting. But then -- and by the
way, that cDNA was created from hundreds of different
patient samples to create what was called a consensus
sequence.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. You've got
the cDNA.
MR. CASTANIAS: And then what the -- what
the Myriad inventors then did to create what is called
SEQ ID number 2 and what is claimed in claim 1 of the
'282 patent is to take -- actually manipulate that
further to add in the introns. It was in -- actually,
the inventive process was additive.
Now, ultimately, again, going back to the
last sentence of section 103, the patentability should
not be negative -- or negated by the manner in which an
invention was made, maybe that shouldn't matter. But it
is a --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, I still
don't understand what -- in what sense it's different
than just snipping along -- along the line.
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, first of all, you
wouldn't even know where to snip until the Myriad
invention. That's the first problem.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So that's a
particular -- where you snip. We're talking about
though the patentability of what's left --
MR. CASTANIAS: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- after you've
snipped it.
MR. CASTANIAS: And -- and that is indeed a
product of human ingenuity and that has substantial new
uses. Now, my friends on the other side have said --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Castanias, go back to
Justice Alito's plant in the Amazon, right because it
takes a lot of ingenuity and a lot of effort to actually
find that plant, just as it takes a lot of effort and a
lot of ingenuity to figure out where to snip on -- on
the genetic material.
But are you -- are you saying that you could
patent that plant because it takes a lot of effort and a
lot of ingenuity to find it?
MR. CASTANIAS: The plant itself, I think
not, Justice Kagan, but I think the question that was --
that was posed was whether I could take an extract from
that plant.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but can you patent the
thing itself?
MR. CASTANIAS: The thing itself I would --
in that hypothetical, I would say the answer is no.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Even though you know you
have to extract the plant itself --
MR. CASTANIAS: It's a lot of --
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- from the Amazon forest.
MR. CASTANIAS: Ah, but you see, now you're
adding the manipulation --
JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not -- I mean, I don't
know what manipulation means. I mean, you have to take
the plant and uproot it, all right?
MR. CASTANIAS: Okay.
JUSTICE KAGAN: And carry it away and
isolate it. Can you now patent the thing itself?
You've now taken it out of the Amazon forest. Can you
now patent it?
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, what I -- what I
haven't done is isolated a new thing. All I have done
is isolate the plant from the forest. And that's the
distinction I think I'm trying to get across to the
Court, not particularly well at least in my colloquy
with Justice Breyer, but I'll try again. And that is
that what -- what was, quote, merely snipped out of the
body here is fundamentally different in kind from what
was in -- what is in the body. The most important
reason it's different in kind is that it cannot be used
in the body to detect the risk of breast and ovarian
cancers.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the plant in the
forest can't be used for any purpose either. It only
has a use when it's taken out -- you know, when it's
uprooted and taken out of the forest. But it's still
the same thing. And I guess what you haven't gotten me
to understand is how this is different than that. It's
still the same thing, but now that you've isolated it,
it in fact has lots of great uses.
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, I think there are two
ways -- two ways to look at that.
First of all, if you want to look at it from
the -- the perspective of the so-called product of
nature doctrine, which I think has some very dangerous
consequences if it's not cabined and understood
correctly. But if you look at it strictly from a
product of nature doctrine, you could say, well, that's
the same plant and it says in the 1930 legislative
history of the Plant Patent Act that plants that are
unmanipulated by the hand of man are not eligible for
patents, and that's fine, in terms of their breeding and
genetics and that sort of thing.
But the product of nature doctrine is
troublesome for this reason, modern medicine -- go
beyond just the isolated DNA patents here. Modern
medicine, particularly the area of personalized
medicine, is trying to get to a point where what we are
administering to individual patients is giving them the
opportunity to mimic the actions of the body. And -- so
actually, the goal of medicine is to get closer to
nature, rather than farther away. And anything that
takes the product of nature doctrine beyond the simple
truism that the product of nature is something that is
not a human invention, then that's very dangerous, not
just for our case --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But when you -- when you
isolate the DNA, that by itself cannot be used as -- as
a probe until you add tags and -- and other chemicals
that make it probe.
MR. CASTANIAS: As a probe, that's true. As
a primer, that wouldn't be required.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seemed to me your --
your answer was not quite accurate when you said, well,
it can't be used in the body to detect breast cancer.
Neither can the isolate without some additions.
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, since this Court --
I'm sorry.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, if it's -- if it's
the process or the additions that make it patentable,
fine. But you're say that the moment it's snipped, it's
patentable, and that it seems to me was -- was the point
of Justice Kagan's question.
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, I -- I will say that
that is the final inventive act. It's not the only
inventive act. It's the final inventive act. If -- if
indeed you were creating it --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you concede -- Do you
concede at least that the decision in the Federal Circuit,
that Judge Lourie did make an incorrect assumption, or is
the Lander brief inaccurate with respect to that, too?
That is, Judge Lourie thought that isolated DNA fragments
did not exist in the human body and Dr. Lander says that
wrong.
MR. CASTANIAS: No, what -- I think
Justice -- Judge Lourie was exactly correct to say that
there is nothing in this record that says that isolated
DNA fragments of BRCA1 exist in the body. Neither does
Dr. Lander's brief, for that matter. And for that
matter, those isolated fragments that are discussed in
Dr. Lander's brief again are -- are what are known
not -- not in any way as isolated DNA, but as
pseudogenes. They're typically things that have been
killed off or mutated by a virus, but they do not --
JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't this just a
question of probability? To get back to your baseball
bat example, which at least I -- I can understand better
than perhaps some of this biochemistry, I suppose that
in, you know, I don't know how many millions of years
trees have been around, but in all of that time possibly
someplace a branch has fallen off a tree and it's fallen
into the ocean and it's been manipulated by the waves,
and then something's been washed up on the shore, and
what do you know, it's a baseball bat.
Is that --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO: -- is that what Dr. Lander
is talking about?
MR. CASTANIAS: That's pretty much the same
as what he's talking about, is that there might be
something that was out there somewhere. But -- but
that's really -- the search for this sort of thing that
might be very similar to the thing but never was known
before. The patent law has taught -- the patent law is
all about pushing the frontiers.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. When you are
on that, that's good. A more basic question to me is
when you use the word "dangerous." I had thought -- and
you can -- I'd be interested in your view -- that the
patent law is filled with uneasy compromises because on
the one hand, we do want people to invent. On the other
hand, we're very worried about them tying up some kind
of whatever it is, particularly a thing that itself
could be used for further advance.
And so that the compromise that has been
built historically into this area is, of course, if you
get a new satisfying process to extract the sap from the
plant in the Amazon, patented. Of course, if you get
the sap out and you find that you can use it, you
manipulate it, you use it, you figure out a way to use
it to treat cancer, wonderful, patented. But what you
can't patent is the sap itself.
Now, in any individual case that might be
unfortunate or fortunate. But consider it in the mine
run of things. It's important to keep products of
nature free of the restrictions that patents there are,
so when Captain Ferno goes to the Amazon and discovers
50 new types of plants, saps and medicines, discovers
them, although that expedition was expensive, although
nobody had found it before, he can't get a patent on the
thing itself. He gets a patent on the process, on the
use of the thing, but not the thing itself.
Now, that's my understanding of what I'd
call hornbook patent law, which you I confess probably
understand better than I.
MR. CASTANIAS: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: And I would like you to
express your view on that because that's the framework
that I am bringing to the case.
MR. CASTANIAS: I -- I will offer the view,
Justice Breyer.
First of all, in this Court's decision in
Brenner v. Manson, followed repeatedly by the Federal
Circuit, it has been hornbook patent law, to use your
term, that you do not need to -- to call out the utility
of an invention in a particular claim. What you do have
to do is have utility for the invention itself described
in the specification.
And that's what the Patent Office looked to
in its Utility Guidelines in 2001. But ultimately,
neither -- I think this case is very -- very easily
decided on a straightforward ground that does not
require the Court to go making fine distinctions between
cDNA and DNA.
And that ground is this: The reasoned
Utility Guidelines issued in 2001 by the Patent Office,
who has not, in a very significant decision, joined the
brief of the Solicitor General in this case -- and which
they continue to apply under Section 2107 of the Manual
of Patent Examining Procedure, this -- these guidelines
not only tell examiners what to do, but in the Federal
Register they had notice and comment and 23 specific
reasoned, supported by case law, supported by science,
responses to the objectors. Almost every objection that
is made to our patents here was made there and answered
there.
The PTO issued those guidelines to the
public. They have been relied on now for 12 years, and
they confirm a practice that has been in place much
longer than that. And if you take -- whether you can
call it Skidmore deference or just giving respect to
the agency that sits at the intersection of law and
science -- Justice Breyer, as your opinion for the Court
in Dickinson v. Zurko pointed out -- those -- that
decision by the Patent Office is entitled to respect,
the reliance that has been placed --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though -- even
though the government has disavowed it, even though the
government, representing the United States --
MR. CASTANIAS: Even though, and -- and the
reason for that is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: At least that the
strength of the presumption would be diluted.
MR. CASTANIAS: I think you can dilute it a
little bit, but you can't take away the fact that it is
a 30-plus year practice that the Patent Office, despite
the executive's position in this Court and in the
Federal Circuit, continues to follow.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Castanias, could I take
you away from the deference point and just ask again
about the -- the kind of law that you would have us
make. Do you think that the first person who isolated
chromosomes could have gotten a patent on that?
MR. CASTANIAS: I think in theory that is
possible, but I should say this because this case is
about Section 101, I'm trying -- I'm answering your
question as though it's about 101, patent eligibility.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes.
MR. CASTANIAS: Would it be obvious, would
it be novel? I'm not sure. Those are different --
those are different analytical structures.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Right.
MR. CASTANIAS: But would it -- and I think
really, the -- the statute does the work here. It is
new and useful composition of matter --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But the first person --
MR. CASTANIAS: -- if it had use. If it had
a new utility, then yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry, because --
because, like Justice Breyer, I consider uses -- patents
on uses in a different category.
So I'm just asking, could you patent the
isolated chromosome?
MR. CASTANIAS: Again, I -- I perhaps am not
making myself as clear as I should. In Section 101, a
patent claim must be shown to be useful. And that --
that is a utility that it has to be shown --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. Chromosomes are very
useful.
MR. CASTANIAS: -- in any case.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KAGAN: The first person who found a
chromosome and isolated it, I think we can all say that
that was a very useful discovery.
And the question is, can you then -- can the
person who found that chromosome and isolated it from
the body, could they have gone to the PTO?
MR. CASTANIAS: If they -- if --
JUSTICE KAGAN: And the PTO seems very
patent happy, so could, you know, would -- would they
have had a good patentability argument?
MR. CASTANIAS: I think if -- to get through
the Section 101 gateway, if that chromosome had a
specific substantial and credible utility, in other
words, it could be used in some --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, of course it does.
MR. CASTANIAS: -- diagnostic way in the way
that we're talking about here, then yes, it would pass
through the Section 101 gate. Whether it would pass
through the Section 102 gate or the 103 gate, I don't
have any opinion on.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Would -- would -- okay.
MR. CASTANIAS: And then there's the
further --
JUSTICE KAGAN: And that's interesting --
MR. CASTANIAS: Sure.
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- because then it's not a
question about, you know, breaking these covalent bonds
or whatever Judge Lourie thought it was about. Right?
So you know, if -- if not DNA, if -- if not
the -- the more smaller unit in the chromosome, you
know, we could just go up from there and talk about all
kinds of parts of the human body, couldn't we? Couldn't
we get to, you know, the first person who found a liver?
MR. CASTANIAS: I -- I think -- I think,
Justice Kagan, you're really putting your finger on the
problem with this, again, I -- I keep wanting to refer
to as the so-called Product of Nature Doctrine because I
don't believe that as a separate doctrine it really
exists. It's just the flip side of the coin of
something that shows a lack of invention.
And, of course, that's where Section 103
comes into full force as the Chief Justice mentioned
earlier in the argument. Section 103 allows you to make
comparisons to what was old and what was new. I don't
think the organ, the liver, gets past 103 in that
circumstance even if you say, well --
JUSTICE BREYER:
101.
MR. CASTANIAS:
101 --
JUSTICE BREYER:
You are saying it gets past
Even if it gets through the
Well, that's -- that's the
problem. I mean, all parts of the human body? Anything
from inside the body that you snip out and isolate?
MR. CASTANIAS: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: And it gets through 101?
Does it have to -- I mean, that's actually what's
bothering me.
MR. CASTANIAS: Okay. So let -- let me try
to help you with that. Because -- because the
distinction is between the liver or the kidney, which
was the one brought up in the federal circuit opinion,
but liver, kidney, you know, gallbladder, pick your
organ. But it's the same thing. It is the same thing
when it's inside the body and it's out. That's where
our --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're not
suggesting if you cut off a piece of the liver or a
piece of the kidney that that somehow makes that piece
patentable.
MR. CASTANIAS: No. Absolutely not. It's
the same thing.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's the
difference? I mean, if you cut off a piece of the whole
in the kidney or liver, you're saying that's not
patentable, but you take a gene and snip off a piece,
that is? What's the difference between the two --
MR. CASTANIAS: I would say that -- I would
say that under -- under your existing decisions in
Chakrabarty, J.E.M., that set forth a broad
understanding of Section 101 and an understanding of
what is within the limited exception, then what -- I --
I would -- I mean, honestly, I think that Section 103
does this work better than Section 101, but to the point
of Section 101, there's -- there is nothing different
about that piece in the body.
JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. Then -- then watch
what you're doing. That's very, very interesting.
Because, really, we are reducing, then, 101 to anything
under the sun, and -- and that, it seems to me, we've
rejected more often than we've followed it.
And particularly with a thing found in
nature doctrine because, of course, it doesn't just --
human kidneys and so forth. Everything is inside
something else. Plants, rocks, whatever you want. And
so everything will involve your vast taking something
out of some other thing where it is, if only the
environment. And it's at that point that I look for
some other test than just that it was found within some
other thing.
MR. CASTANIAS: And I think, Justice Breyer,
there is where I've -- I've tried to explain to you
about the different functions, the different values. If
you think about patents as economic instruments, the
different economic values that come out of this, the
different things that patients now have as a result of
this human ingenuity, they didn't have the BRCA1
isolated gene before the Myriad invention.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we could have said
that with atomic energy, with electric, but so far the
choice -- electricity -- but so far the choice of the
patent was that we have a uniform rule for all
industries.
MR. CASTANIAS: Right, but in --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and that avoids
giving special industries special subsidies, which is
very important it seems to me.
Let me ask you this, and it's consistent
with my -- my preface. If we were to accept the
government's position that the DNA is not patentable but
the cDNA is, would that give the industry sufficient
protection for innovation and research? And if not, why
not?
MR. CASTANIAS: The -- the problem of making
that decision now is that so much has happened since
these gene patents issued and since the Utility
Guidelines. I can't tell you for a certainty whether it
will hurt the industry as a general matter to not have
isolated gene but only have cDNA patents.
But here's what I think it will hurt, and I
think it ultimately will hurt the doctrine that this
Court comes out of this case with. Because what you
will then be asking litigants to do and courts to do is
to draw fine distinctions under Section 101 between,
well, how much more manipulation.
My friend on the other side used the term,
in response to Justice Ginsburg, "further manipulation
is required to take it out of the product of nature."
He -- he said no alteration, to Justice Alito, would
make it a product of nature. But there's no dispute in
this case that there has been some alteration of the
isolated DNA molecules.
And that brings me back to the Utility
Guidelines. This line was drawn. It was drawn by an
expert agency that sits at the intersection of law and
science, and it has said, without any apparent -- other
than the declarations and amicus briefs that have been
put into this case -- without any apparent effect on the
explosion in biotechnology and the successful,
economically successful, technologically successful, and
life-saving industry that is at the heart of these
inventions.
That has not -- those -- that parade of
horribles has not happened. And you don't have to
hypothesize at this point because you've got all of
these years of experience between the time these patents
issued and the time that this -- this challenge
belatedly came along.
Justice Breyer, a point about no
impermissible preemption before I sit down. Your
opinion for the Court in Mayo made that very much an
important point, but I think what you -- what is
important to understand here is that these patent claims
aren't for methods. They don't prevent -- present that
problem that the Court identified in that argument and
in the argument in Bilski. These are for specific
molecules that exist in the physical world. That --
that concern that is present with method claims is not
here, these patents cover -- these patent claims cover
only what is claimed and no more.
There is no risk of a natural law or a
physical phenomenon like energy or electricity, neither
of which falls within the statutory categories. There
is no risk of anything being preempted other than what
the claims properly claim, which are human-made
inventions of isolated molecules.
And I think one last point to close on.
It's important to note that molecules have been patented
for a very long time. That's what drugs are. And drugs
are often made by taking one molecule and another
molecule, both of which are known, reacting them in a
test tube, which is a very common thing, its reactions
have been around 100 years just like snipping has been,
but they make something new and useful and life saving
from that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand
how this is at all like that because there you're
obviously combining things and getting something
new. Here you're just snipping, and you don't have
anything new, you have something that is a part of
something that has existed previous to your
intervention.
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, again,
Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I -- the discussion we had
earlier, the -- in -- in fact, the sequence that's
claimed in Claim 1 of the '282 patent was not created by
snipping. If I can just conclude with one more
sentence?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.
MR. CASTANIAS: Only once it was created can
a scientist ever know how and where to make the decision
to snip.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Hansen, you have three minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. HANSEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HANSEN: Thank you, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there some value to
us striking down isolated DNA and upholding the cDNA?
If we were to do what the government is proposing in
this case, what's the consequences?
MR. HANSEN: Of -- of course there would be
value in that in the sense that -- that, A, it
reinforces the Product of Nature Doctrine, but more
importantly, the effect of the patents in this case
allows Myriad to stop all research on a part of the
human body. If you uphold the patents in this case,
Myriad can -- has the authority given it by the
government to stop anyone from doing research on a piece
of the human body. That would be a significant advance,
if you were to -- to make it clear that was
impermissible.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, how do you
understand Judge Bryson's dissent with respect to cDNA?
I think he's saying that a gene created from -- into
cDNA as a whole is okay, but that he had a problem with
the description of that claim because it included 15
nucleotide long segments or fragments which he says
reoccur in nature.
MR. HANSEN: Well, and yes, I -- I agree,
Your Honor, that he was focusing on Claims 5 and 6,
which are the ones that include 15 nucleotides or -- or
longer.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I'm making your job
harder. How could they write it to do what he thinks
would be patentable?
MR. HANSEN: Well, all --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So assuming we believe
that there is some human invention in this process,
whether it's obvious or not, separate question. But
he's not creating -- the cDNA is not in nature
naturally.
So make that assumption. Make the
assumption that they can make a claim for it. How do we
avoid his problem?
MR. HANSEN: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know you are helping
your adversary by answering this question.
MR. HANSEN: That's fine, Your Honor. I
think that the -- all of the claims in this case, all
nine claims that we are challenging include both
fragments and the whole gene. So I don't think there is
anything you can do with respect to these nine claims.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I am putting that aside.
MR. HANSEN: I think by saying that when
genes are transformed in such a way that the scientist
decides their sequence rather than the nature deciding
their sequence --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Only if they do a
recombinant DNA, that's what you are saying.
MR. HANSEN: Right, right. Now I don't
think cDNA is recombinant DNA, that's what we've argued,
but that's -- that's at least one plausible way of
looking at it.
The genes in this case, the patents on the
genes in this case cover the genes of every man, woman,
and child in the United States. And as I just said, it
gives the -- the government has given Myriad the
authority to stop research on every one of our genes.
That simply can't be right.
And I would like to make one other point
with respect to Dr. Lander's brief. On page 16 of Dr.
Lander's brief he discusses specifically that the BRCA
genes appear in the body with covalent bonds in
fragments. There isn't any real -- there isn't any
scientific dispute about that fact.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you take
another minute. You weren't afforded an opportunity to
use the time you were reserved.
MR. HANSEN: Well, I guess the only other
thing I would say then, Your Honor, is to respond to
what I may have left a misimpression with Justice
Kagan's questions. We agree that you could get a patent
on a use of the leaf that is pulled out of the Amazon or
a plant that is pulled out of the Amazon. We don't
dispute that. We don't think you cannot get a patent on
the thing -- the plant itself just because you pulled it
out of the ground and took it to the United States.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:11 a.m., the case in the
