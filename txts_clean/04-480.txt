CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
now in number 04-480, MGM Studios versus Grokster,
Limited.
Mr. Verrilli.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Copyright infringement is the only commercially
significant use of the Grokster and StreamCast services,
and that is no accident. Respondents deliberately set out
to capture a clientele of known infringers to stock their
services with infringing content, they intentionally and
directly promote the infringing use of the service, they
support infringing use of the service, and they directly
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just interrupt for the
one -- you said "the only significant use." There's a
footnote in the red brief that says the figure is some 2.6
billion legitimate uses.
MR. VERRILLI: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that correct, or incorrect?
MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think it's an absolutely
incorrect assertion of reality, and perhaps I could delve
into it and explain why.
The evidence in this case, which was presented
at summary judgment, showed that 90 percent of the
material on the services was either definitely or very
likely to be infringing.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, was there a finding of 90
percent?
MR. VERRILLI: Well, this was submitted on
summary judgment, Your Honor, and we lost summary
judgment, so the evidence has got to be construed in the
light most favorable to us. And the Ninth Circuit decided
the case on the assumption, we'd submit, of 90 percent.
But with respect to that 10 percent, what
happened, and we submit is completely wrong, is that the
Ninth Circuit drew the inference, because it wasn't shown
by our expert study, which, by the way, is the only
empirical analysis in the case, to be infringing, that the
Court could assume that it was noninfringing and then
extrapolate from that to a number along the lines of the
number that Your Honor suggested. And I think that that's
completely illegitimate analysis, factually, and, besides,
that number is big only because the overall activity is so
big. The scale of the whole thing is mind-boggling. If
there are that many noninfringing uses --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It goes to the --
MR. VERRILLI: -- imagine how many infringing --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- accuracy of your statement
that there is no other significant legitimate use.
MR. VERRILLI: I don't think there -- I think
it's quite accurate on the summary-judgment record, and
certainly drawing the inferences in our favor, as we must
here on summary -- on this summary-judgment record, that
there is commercially significant noninfringing use.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there could be. There
could be, both with respect to material in the public
domain and with respect to people who authorize the
transmission.
MR. VERRILLI: I don't think, in the context of
this record in this case and the business model of these
Defendants, Grokster and StreamCast, that that is true,
Justice Ginsburg. I don't think that's right. I think
what Grokster and StreamCast are arguing is that this
Court's decision in Sony stands for the proposition that
their massive actual infringement is -- gets a free pass,
a perpetual free pass, so long as they can speculate that
there are noninfringing uses out there, such as public-
domain uses and authorized uses. We don't think that that
-- that Sony stands for any such proposition.
We also want to point out that that doesn't help
them -- that proposition doesn't help them with respect to
one very significant part of this case, and that's the
fact that they intentionally built a network of infringing
users, and they actively encouraged and assisted
infringement.
Now, even if there are commercially significant
noninfringing uses, and we submit there most definitely
aren't under Sony, but even if there are, that's no
defense to a contributory infringement claim based on
intentional building up of an infringing business and
active encouragement and assistance of infringement, and
it can't be; because, otherwise, then the fact that they
had commercially significant noninfringing uses, again,
would be just a free pass to actively promote infringing
uses; not merely to support them, but to promote them.
And so --
JUSTICE SOUTER: BUt, your argument, I take it,
would be the same if the proportions were reversed. Your
argument with respect to -- your current argument with
respect to infringing use would be the same if only 10
percent -- if it were assumed that only 10 percent of the
use were illegitimate and infringing. Is that correct?
MR. VERRILLI: The active-encouragement aspect
of our argument would be the same, certainly.
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.
MR. VERRILLI: They don't get a -- they don't
get a free pass to encourage any infringement.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that the same as active
inducement --
MR. VERRILLI: Yes. I think there's --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- as that term --
MR. VERRILLI: -- there's a lot of --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- is used?
MR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor, there's a
lot of lingo floating around in this case -- inducement,
active encouragement, assistance.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: If we should think that the
Respondents are not liable for the type of contributory
infringement dealt with in Sony, could this Court reach
the question of active inducement on this record?
MR. VERRILLI: Yes, very definitely. I think --
I think the Court, of course, should find that there's
contributory liability under the Sony theory --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I know you do, but --
MR. VERRILLI: -- but with respect to --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- I just said --
MR. VERRILLI: -- that theory --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- could you --
MR. VERRILLI: Yes.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- assume, for a moment, that
we didn't; could we, nonetheless, address the active
inducement --
MR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and let me
explain why. The District Court in this case issued a
partial final judgment, under rule 54(b), granting the
Respondent's summary-judgment motions. Now, we argued for
contributory liability on two theories in the District
Court and in the Ninth Circuit. We argued that there was a
lack of commercially significant noninfringing use under
Sony, and we've argued the inducement or active-
encouragement theory. We argued that both theories entitle
us to relief against the current operations of the service,
to entitle us to damages, and entitle us to injunctive
relief to eliminate the harmful ongoing infringing
consequences of this intentionally built-up infringement
machine.
The District Court granted summary judgment
against us and gave a clean bill of health, gave
absolution, essentially, to the current versions of the
services. The only thing that was left to us, as the
Ninth Circuit and the District Court -- and the District
Court, both, understood the law, is that we can go back
and try to show that, with respect to specific past acts
of infringement, if we can show that they occurred at a
time when we had given them notice that they were about to
--
occur, and that we had the power to -- and they had the
power to stop them at the moment we gave them the notice,
that we can get damages for those specific things, and
those specific things only. That's all that's left in
this case. And I think it's quite clear, from the Rule
(b) certification order of the District Court that it
was only damages with the past services and the past acts
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear -- it's not
clear to me from your brief, focusing on the contributory
aspect of it, not -- and not the inducement part of it --
it's not clear to me from your brief what your test is.
What do we tell the trier of fact, that if there is a
substantial part of the use which is noninfringement, if
there's any part?
MR. VERRILLI: Here's what I -- here's where I
think the test --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Leaving aside the inducement.
MR. VERRILLI: Right. Here's what I -- here's
what we think the test is on the -- what we'll call the
Sony aspect of the case, that it's -- the question here is
-- Sony poses to us -- is really a touchstone kind of
question, not a numerical kind of question. The question
under Sony is whether this is a business that is
substantially unrelated to infringement. In other words,
are they building their business on supporting legitimate
activity, or, instead, are they building their business
supporting infringing activity?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then we just throw this
to the birds on the trier of fact in every case --
MR. VERRILLI: No, I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how do we know --
MR. VERRILLI: And that's where you start.
That's the touchstone. Now, the numbers, the relative
proportions of use, are relevant. In a case like Sony
itself, certainly, where the majority use was
noninfringing, that's a legitimate business; you don't
need to go further. In a case like this one, where,
taking the record at summary judgeent in our favor, as it
must be, and the Ninth Circuit's assumption that you've
got 90 percent infringing use, billions and billions of
acts of infringing use, and minuscule actual noninfringing
use, it seems to us it's just --
JUSTICE BREYER: You're not saying -- now you're
using different tests. Your test is "substantial." All
right, on your test, are we sure, if you were the counsel
to Mr. Carlson, that you recommend going ahead with the
Xerox machine? Are you sure, if you were the counsel to
the creator of the VCR, that you could recommend, given
the use, copying movies, that we should ever have a VCR?
--
Are you sure that you could recommend to the iPod inventor
that he could go ahead and have an iPod, or, for that
matter, Gutenberg, the press? I mean, you see the
problem.
MR. VERRILLI: Yes, I think my answer to --
JUSTICE BREYER: What's the answer?
MR. VERRILLI: -- those questions are: yes, yes,
yes, and yes.
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE BREYER: Because in each case -- for all
I know, the monks had a fit when Gutenberg made his press
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE BREYER: -- but the problem, of course,
is that it could well be, in each of those instances, that
there will be vast numbers of infringing uses that are
foreseeable.
MR. VERRILLI: I disagree with that, Your Honor.
Certainly not -- I don't think there's any empirical
evidence to suggest, with respect to any of the things
that Your Honor just identified -- and let me pick out the
iPod as one, because it's the most current example, I
guess. From the moment that device was introduced, it was
obvious that there were very significant lawful commercial
uses for it. And let me clarify something I think is
unclear from the amicus briefs. The record companies, my
clients, have said, for some time now, and it's been on
their Website for some time now, that it's perfectly
lawful to take a CD that you've purchased, upload it onto
your computer, put it onto your iPod. There is a very,
very significant lawful commercial use for that device,
going forward.
And, remember, I -- what our test -- our test is
not "substantial." Our test is that it's a -- it's a --
when it's a vast-majority use, like here, it's a clear
case of contribution --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you -- how do you know,
going in, Mr. Verrilli? I mean, I'm about to start the
business. How much time do you give me to bring up the
lawful use to the level where it will outweigh the
unlawful use? I have to know, going in.
MR. VERRILLI: Well, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's one thing to sit back
and, you know, calculate with this ongoing business, it's
percent/10 percent. But I'm a new inventor, and I'm --
you know --
MR. VERRILLI: I think the weight --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I'm going to get sued right
away. I know I'm going to get sued right away, before I
have a chance to build up a business.
MR. VERRILLI: I don't think that's right, Your
Honor, and here's why. To -- it's not just the absence of
commercially significant noninfringing uses that
demonstrates contributory infringement. I mean, you have
to demonstrate that you're making a material contribution,
with knowledge that you're doing so. The inventor, at the
outset, is not in that position. They're not making a
contribution with knowledge that they're doing so. Do
they have absolute certainty? No, they don't have
absolute certainty.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't quite understand
the -- I take it, inventors are profit-motive-driven, and
if they know that something they're working on is going to
have copyright experience, you -- have got copyright
problems, you can't just say, "Oh, well, the inventor's
going to invent anyway."
MR. VERRILLI: Well, I -- but the problem --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or did I misunderstand your --
MR. VERRILLI: No, I -- I think that you have --
to show contribution, you should have -- you have to be
making a material contribution, with knowledge that you're
doing so. And so --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the inventor of Xerox does
that. I mean, he puts out the machine. He knows some --
he knows a lot of people are going to use it to Xerox
books.
MR. VERRILLI: I don't think that's right,
Justice Scalia. I don't think there's anywhere close to a
showing -- I don't think there could be anywhere close to
a showing that you've got the vast majority of use from --
for infringement from the time that the device comes out.
I just don't think that's --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's go --
MR. VERRILLI: -- realistic.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- let's go from Xerox back to
your iPod. How is that clear in the iPod case? I may not
understand what people are doing out there, but it's
certainly not clear to me. I know perfectly well I could
go out and buy a CD and put it on my iPod, but I also know
perfectly well that if I can get the music on the iPod
without buying the CD, that's what I'm going to do. And I
think it's reasonable to suppose that everybody else would
guess that. So why, in the iPod, do you not have this
Damoclean sword?
MR. VERRILLI: Well, because I don't actually
think that there is evidence that you've got overwhelming
infringing use. I just think that's -- it's not a -- it's
not a --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there's never evidence at
the time the guy is sitting in the garage figuring out
whether to invent the iPod or not. I mean, that's --
MR. VERRILLI: I think when you get to the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the concern.
MR. VERRILLI: -- I think when you have vast-
majority infringing use, they should be on the hook. Now,
I don't think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but you're --
MR. VERRILLI: -- you have that problem --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're --
MR. VERRILLI: -- with the iPod, and --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- you're not answering --
you're not answering the question. The question is, How
do we know in advance, on your test, anything that would
give the inventor, or, more exactly, the developer, the
confidence to go ahead? As was said a minute ago, he
knows he's going to be sued immediately. There isn't a
product performance out there, as there is in this case.
So, on your substantiality theory, why isn't it a foregone
conclusion in the iPod that the iPod loser -- or developer
is going to lose his shirt?
MR. VERRILLI: Well, first of all, I don't -- I
think it's just counterfactual to think that there is
going to be overwhelming infringing use of the iPod in the
way that there indisputably is here. Second, to the
extent you get the closer cases, it is our position, as I
gather it is the position of the United States, that you
look at -- to see what kind of business model the
Defendant is operating under. Is it a -- is it -- are
they marketing it for legitimate purposes? Are they
taking reasonable steps to prevent infringement? If they
are, then they -- then they're not liable. Third --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's your second argument, I
think. I thought you were going to just stick with the --
with the first one. I mean, that's an inducement
argument.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, that's inducement.
MR. VERRILLI: No, I don't think it is an
inducement argument, because it doesn't go all the way to
requiring us to show, as we can show here, that they've
got intent. But I do think that the issue is, you know,
really -- in the real world, you know, it isn't the case
that these guys have gotten immediately sued. That's just
not right. And the -- and the reality is that what
happens is what happens here. There's perfectly valid
uses --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it is the case under the
test you're submitting to us.
MR. VERRILLI: No, I don't think that's right,
Justice Kennedy. If there's vast-majority infringing use,
and you continue to operate your business with the
--
--
knowledge that there's vast-majority infringing use, then
you've got liability. Now, of course, we do have all the
additional inducement facts here, but we've also got those
facts. And in the real world --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, are you dealing with
active inducement as just a theoretical add-on, or is that
a satisfactory way to resolve this case?
MR. VERRILLI: I think that it is a -- I think
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I don't understand --
MR. VERRILLI: Neither, is the answer.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- your pitch.
MR. VERRILLI: Neither, is the answer. It is a
basis for resolving this case, but not to the exclusion of
getting the law right on Sony.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you couldn't get summary
judgment. Your reply brief said, "This case is so clear
that we should get summary judgment." If inducement is
the theory -- you have just said, you have to show intent
MR. VERRILLI: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- so you could not --
MR. VERRILLI: We --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you'd have to go to trial.
MR. VERRILLI: We agree with that. We think, in
a situation where the vast majority of the use is
infringing and there isn't any evidence of a legitimate
business plan, on the Sony part of the case we would be
entitled to summary judgment. We agree with you, Your
Honor, that with respect to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Sony itself had a trial --
MR. VERRILLI: That's right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a full trial.
MR. VERRILLI: It came after the trial, that's
right. But the -- a key point I think I want to make here
is that this is not about this technology. What happens
in the real world is that inventors come up with
technology. Some people use it for lawful purposes and
valid purposes, as some people use this technology for;
some people abuse the technology to run business that --
businesses that are devoted to expropriating the value of
copyrights. That's exactly what's going on in this case.
If I could reserve the balance of my time, Mr.
Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.
Verrilli.
Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The decision below allows companies, like
Respondents, to build a business model out of copyright
infringement without fear of secondary liability. As long
as they avoid obtaining actual knowledge that a particular
customer is about to infringe a particular copyright, they
are free to operate a system that involves massive
copyright infringement with full knowledge that the draw
of the entire system for customers and advertisers alike
is the unlawful copying. No matter much how much of that
system --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what do you think Sony
allowed? It talked about -- if it's, what, capable of
substantial noninfringing use, it's okay?
MR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice O'Connor.
And then I think the Court explained and elaborated that
the test is whether or not there are commercially
significant noninfringing uses. And I would say what the
Ninth Circuit did in this case is basically adopt the test
of mere theoretical capability for noninfringing use, plus
maybe some anecdotal evidence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what -- and your test is
whether there's a substantial use that's lawful?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think the way we would try
to articulate it is that if the way that the business
model of the particular Defendant is set up is that they
are not involved in a business substantially unrelated
from copyright infringement, that there should be
liability in that situation. And I think in an extreme
case like this, where over 90 percent of the business --
and I think Mr. Verrilli correctly describes that it's not
a minimum of 90 percent; it's over 90 percent -- because
the only evidence on the other side is anecdotal evidence
that there are such things as public-domain works.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Clement, where did
the 90 percent figure come from? I know we have to accept
it because it's summary judgment, but where did it come
from?
MR. CLEMENT: It came from a study by
Petitioners' experts of the actual operation of the
system. And what they did is, they identified about 75
percent of the works as clearly infringing works, another
percent of the works were identified as very likely
infringing works, then there were 10 percent they just
couldn't tell anything about.
JUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was just limited
to music.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think the -- it's not --
the system is not limited to music.
JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I thought the study
was about music.
MR. CLEMENT: I'm not sure about that, but --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I thought -- I mean, you
know, we've had 90 briefs in this, and some briefs tear it
apart, and others support it, but we also have briefs from
the ACLU saying you could put whole libraries within this
system.
MR. CLEMENT: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: The question I wanted to ask
you is, given that concern, that there are, conceptually
anyway, really excellent uses of this thing, does
deliberate -- what is the word?
MR. CLEMENT: Actual inducement?
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Because what you are
worried about, it seemed to me that the actual inducement
would take care of. And if you sent it back and said,
"Let's have a trial on actual inducement." If this really
is the extreme case you're talking about, why wouldn't the
Petitioners here be bound to win that trial?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, based on our review of the
record -- and we haven't been able to see the entire
record -- I agree with you, the Petitioners ought to be
able to win this case on an active-inducement ground, and
that's a narrow way to decide the case. I do think,
though, this Court might have to say something about the
Sony issue before it reached that issue. And if it did
feel compelled to do that, I think it would be a mistake
to sanction the Ninth Circuit's reading of Sony, because,
you're right, there's a theoretical possibility that
public-domain works can be exchanged on this system, but
it's also true that this system doesn't have much of a
comparative advantage for trading in public-domain works.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you got interrupted a
bit. Tell us, in the simplest way you can, what test you
think Sony stands for and how the Ninth got it wrong, if
you believe it.
MR. CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor, it stands for --
the test is whether or not there are commercially
significant noninfringing uses. The Ninth Circuit got it
wrong because it thought that test was satisfied by a
combination of two things: being able to point out that
there were such things as public-domain works or
authorized sharing of the Wilco album, for example, and
anecdotal evidence that you could actually do that.
Now, if that were the right reading of Sony,
with respect, I would suggest that footnote 23 of this
Court's Sony decision would have been the sum total of the
Court's analysis, because in that footnote the Court
observed that there were broadcasts of public-domain
works.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the owner of the
instrumentality, the program, thinks that there's going to
be a vast area of lawful use, and he knows that there's
going to be some abuse at the -- in the short term, but he
does everything he can to discourage that. He says, "This
is a two -- P2P is going to revolutionize the way we talk
to each other, there's things in the public domain.
Please don't use this for copyright." But he knows that
there's going to be some infringement, let's say that
it'll be 50 percent of the use, in the short term. Can he
use the program?
MR. CLEMENT: If it's 50 percent infringement in
the short run? We think, absolutely, yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, that he can --
MR. CLEMENT: He can --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- use the program.
MR. CLEMENT: -- use the program. I mean, as we
suggest, if you're at a 50-50 -- I mean, if you're
anywhere below 50 percent, we think that there should be
no liability under the Sony standard. If you're above
that level and there's sufficient evidence that you're
really targeting infringing uses, then I think maybe there
would be liability. But in the hypothetical you suggest,
there would clearly not be liability in that situation.
What we would like to suggest, though, is there
ought to be enough room for -- under the Sony test, before
you reach actual inducement, to capture somebody where
they've clearly set out, as a business model, to deal with
the infringing uses. And the only thing they point to are
the theoretical possibility, anecdotal evidence, that it
could be used for public-domain works.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If there's more, they could
bring it out at trial, could they not? The difference
between your position and Mr. Verrilli, I take it, is that
you think there should be not summary judgment for the
Petitioners, but a trial.
MR. CLEMENT: I think that's a fair point,
Justice Ginsburg. We're operating in something of a
disadvantage, because we haven't seen the entirety of the
record. Based on the record that I've seen, I think
there's a close case, unless perhaps once this Court
clarifies the legal standard, Respondents put on
additional evidence. I think this is a close case, where
you actually could grant summary judgment in favor of the
Petitioners. But certainly we have no objection to having
a trial on the Sony issue in this case. What we object to
is the Ninth Circuit rule, which, in every case, is going
to obviate the need for a trial, based on a showing that
there are such things as public-domain works.
--
JUSTICE SCALIA: The inducement -- the
inducement point doesn't get you very far. Presumably a
successor to Grokster, or whatever this outfit is called,
could simply come in and not induce anybody but say, you
know, "We're setting up the same system," know very well
what people are going to use it for, but not induce them.
And that would presumably be okay.
MR. CLEMENT: I think that's potentially right
JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is why you need --
MR. CLEMENT: -- Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the Sony --
MR. CLEMENT: -- and that's why I think it's
important to preserve a role for the Sony test. And,
again, this Court, in Sony, could have adopted a simple
theoretical-capability test, but this Court, instead,
adopted a test that required there to be shown some
commercially significant use for the -- noninfringing use.
And even in the patent context, where I think the test is,
and should be, more demanding, even in that context, cases
like Fromberg, which we cite at page 19 of our brief, show
that there is an analysis to make sure that the suggested
theoretical noninfringing use is, in fact, a practical use
of the item.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Will you give a company ten
years to establish that?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what I worry about is
the suit that just comes right out of the box, as soon as
the company starts up. Will you give the company a couple
of years to show that it's developing a commercial use?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, we have
concerns about that, as well. I don't know that we would
give them ten years of, sort of, free space to do as --
facilitate as much copyright infringement as possible. I
think what we would say is that when you're -- when a suit
targets a nascent technology at the very beginning, there
ought to be a lot of leeway, not just for observed
noninfringing uses, but for the capacity of noninfringing
uses.
I don't think, in fairness, that's what you have
before you in this case, because this is a case where the
peer-to-peer technology was out there, it was employed in
a particular way, with a centralized server, in a way that
was actually -- had a lot of users involved in it, and
they were users of the old Napster system, that had a
distinct character. They were using that system for
infringing copyrighted musical works. And then these
individuals come along and seek to capitalize on that
market. That is their business plan from day one. And
it's not some newfangled idea. The only newfangled idea
here is that if you give something of value away for free
by ignoring the copyright laws, you're likely to draw
consumers to your site, and you're likely to attract
advertisers. But that cannot be the kind of innovation
that we want to further through a development of secondary
liability into the copyright laws.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Clement, in one way this
presents an easy case for answering Justice Scalia's
question, but what about a case in which there isn't the
Napster example to start with? Should there be some kind
of a flexible rightness doctrine in response to suits, as
Justice Scalia put it, against the inventor or developer
right out of the box?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, whether you call it a
flexible rightness doctrine or you develop the doctrine in
a way that is very forgiving --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Congress of laches.
MR. CLEMENT: -- a brand-new technology.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Congress of laches.
MR. CLEMENT: Right. I mean, I think -- the way
I would style it is to develop a substantive standard
that's very forgiving of brand-new technologies and allows
people to point to, in those situations, capabilities for
future uses. I do think that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: How would you express the --
how would you express that, that substantive standard that
anticipates, just as you suggested we do?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I was just trying to
articulate it, which is to say that this Court has talked
about the capacity for noninfringing uses. I think, with
a mature product like this, it's fair to point to how it's
actually used in the marketplace.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
Clement.
MR. CLEMENT: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Taranto, we'll
hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. TARANTO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
Because Respondent's software products are tools
of autonomous communications that have large and growing
legitimate uses, their distribution is protected under the
clear Sony rule. That rule should be adhered to by this
Court, because copyright does not generally step into the
role of product control, because doing so would cause
overkill. The Sony rule safeguards legitimate uses by
protecting the product and --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but active inducement
is a doctrine that's been employed to curb the intentional
encouragement of noninfringing uses, isn't it?
MR. TARANTO: Not in copyright law, it hasn't,
but that's not my primary point. My primary point is that
it is critical, it is jurisdictionally critical, to
separate two separate acts, distributing the product and
any of the past acts that the Petitioners allege
constituted encouragement, their synonym for "inducement,"
which were explicitly outside the District Court ruling
that was certified for interlocutory appeal.
Questions about past acts not inherent in the
distribution of our product remain in --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But they are inherent. They
are inherent. I mean, the point is that those past acts
are what have developed your client's current clientele.
MR. TARANTO: No, I don't think so, Justice
Scalia. The Petitioners -- this is what I think is here
and usable about the past acts. They claim that there is
an intent, as part of the current distribution of the
product, to profit from increased use, including
generically known infringing use, a point on which the
District Court and the Court of Appeals assumed to be the
case. Beyond that, the question whether there were
encouraging acts, any kind of promotional activity that
--
says, "We ask you to, and urge you to, use this product
for infringement," that is not here, because that was
explicitly part of the past activities, removed from the
District Court decision. And when the Petitioners sought
interlocutory appeal, they said, expressly, these were
"distinct and severable," in their terms -- that's a quote
JUSTICE SOUTER: But I don't --
MR. TARANTO: -- from the past.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- understand how you can
separate the past from the present in that fashion. One,
I suppose, could say, "Well, I'm going to make inducing
remarks Monday through Thursday, and I'm going to stop,
Thursday night." The sales of the product on Friday are
still going to be sales which are the result of the
inducing remarks Monday through Wednesday. And you're
asking, in effect -- you're asking us -- to ignore Monday
through Thursday.
MR. TARANTO: No, I'm not. Let me try to be
clear. There is a theory, not present here, along exactly
those lines, which Petitioners are entitled to argue, back
in the District Court, without a remand, because that
issue remains in the District Court. It is a theory that
says, "You started your business with illegitimate acts,
your current business is a causal consequence of that." I
will say, there is not one bit of evidence that the
Petitioners introduced, in resisting summary judgment, in
support of that theory. It is, in fact, a highly
implausible theory, for reasons that the District Court
can explain, because users of software like this switch
readily. There is no plausible lock-in effect to this
software. People go from Kazaa to Grokster to eDonkey to
BitTorrent week by week. That was -- that is an available
theory. You would --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why was current -- why was
inducement, as a current theory of recovery, even the
subject of summary judgment? It seems to me that to make
it a summary judgment is implausible to a nonworldly
degree.
MR. TARANTO: I'm not entirely --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, I thought you were
saying that, so far as the inducement theory of recovery
is concerned --
MR. TARANTO: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the only summary judgment
that was granted was with respect to current acts of
inducement, the way the company is acting now, not the way
the company was acting last year. And my question is --
if that is correct, then I don't see how summary judgment
could even intelligibly have been considered.
MR. TARANTO: I think -- because as the
Petitioners insisted when they pressed for interlocutory
appeal, they said these were distinct and severable,
because, as Justice Scalia referred to before, the
important question, on a going-forward basis, is whether
the current set of activities -- this software, given how
it operates, being generally distributed -- is a vendor's
-- the distributor of that software -- secondarily liable
because somebody else, tomorrow, can do exactly the same
thing, without the baggage of any past acts.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't want to get us
too far off the track on this question, but it just seems
to me that what you've done before bears on what you know,
or have reason to know, on an ongoing basis.
MR. TARANTO: I agree with that, Justice
Kennedy, but there's no dispute about that. This case was
decided on the assumption, which we are not contesting
here, that the Respondents here knew that there would be
widespread infringing use of a product that they were
putting out, and, what's more, that they intended to
profit from maximum use of the product, which necessarily
would include infringing use, which they had no ability to
separate from noninfringing use.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then why don't you tell
us what's wrong with the Government's test and with the
Petitioner's test, the substantial-use part of it?
MR. TARANTO: Well, I'm not entirely -- I think
there are several tests, and I'm not sure I followed them
all here. We think it is critical that the Court adhere,
for innovation protection, to the very clear Sony rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That, Mr. Taranto, is
something I find very puzzling. There is a statement --
one could take it as clear -- "capable of substantial
noninfringing use." That would be very clear, I agree.
But Sony goes on for 13 more pages. If the standard were
all that clear, it would have stopped there. And usually
when you're interpreting a document, one rule is, you read
on, and if you read on, you find we need not give precise
content to the question of how much use is commercially
significant. That doesn't sound very clear to me. Or if
you then read back, as a careful reader would, then you
find this statement that the primary use of the Sony
machine for most owners was time-shifting, a use that the
Court found either authorized or fair, and, hence,
noninfringing.
So I don't think you can take from what is a
rather long opinion, and isolate one sentence, and say,
"Aha, we have a clear rule."
MR. TARANTO: Well, that sentence, Justice
Ginsburg, is expressly stated to be the rule of law that
is being applied. And then the Court went on to apply it
to say, there are two things that satisfy the test. The
primary thing, of course, is what takes up most of those
pages, the question whether in-home time-shifting is
fair use, a question that was of considerable interest to
tens of millions of individuals throughout the United
States. But the Court, in fact, didn't rely only on that;
it said, "In addition, there was this roughly 7 to 9
percent use of authorized time-shifting." It wouldn't
have had to even talk about that if the primary use, you
know, was the entirety of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, I hope you won't
waste a lot of your time on this point. This Court is
certainly not going to decide this case on the basis of
stare decisis, you know, whatever else is true.
MR. TARANTO: Well, I will -- let me urge that
there is, in fact, considerable weight to stare decisis,
because there are major technological industries that have
relied on the rule that derives from patent law that there
is no, kind of, predominant-use kind of meaning to the Sony
rule. In the patent context from which this came, all
there has to be, in Professor Chisum's words, is, uses
that are not farfetched, illusory, uneconomical for the
user. And the inquiry there is, is this a product whose
-- where the same features that are alleged to cause the
infringement are also, in some nontrivial way, used for
noninfringement?
JUSTICE BREYER: What is -- what is the answer
to Justice Kennedy's question? I took it, whether -- for
the last 21 years, industry throughout America has taken
the standard as being approximately whether it is capable
of substantial -- commercially significant substantial
noninfringing uses.
MR. TARANTO: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: I -- and the country seems to
have survived that standard. There is innovation. There
are problems in the music industry, but it thrives, and so
forth. So there is an argument for just following it,
because it's what it is. But suppose it's totally open.
Why should that be the right test, instead of some other
test, like substantial use, et cetera?
MR. TARANTO: I -- because I --
JUSTICE BREYER: That, I think, was the
question, and I'm very interested in your answer.
MR. TARANTO: Right. Because I think any
alternative is worse. A focus on intent to profit means
that virtually every business which requires money and has
the least bit of sensible forward-looking thinking about
what the usage is going to be will be subject to
litigation, arguing about their knowing that a substantial
amount of the value of the product was going to be based
on infringement.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But --
MR. TARANTO: Every --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but what you have -- what
you want to do is to say that unlawfully expropriated
property can be used by the owner of the instrumentality
as part of the startup capital for his product.
MR. TARANTO: I -- well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- just from an economic
standpoint and a legal standpoint, that sounds wrong to
MR. TARANTO: Well, I'm not entirely sure about
that formulation. Sony clearly sold many more tapes
because of the illicit activity of Library. Sony
presumably sold more machines, maybe even priced them
higher, because there was a group of people who wanted the
machine for the illicit activity. The Apple iPod, in the
gigabit version, holds 15,000 songs. That's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think that --
MR. TARANTO: -- a thousand CDs.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- unlawfully expropriated
property can be a legitimate part of the startup capital.
MR. TARANTO: No, I -- what I think is that, as
a matter of general judicially formulated secondary
--
copyright liability law, there is no better policy balance
that the Court can strike, and that only Congress can make
the judgments about what the industry-wide facts are.
And I -- let me pause there a minute -- there are no
industry-wide facts in this record. Every citation in the
Petitioner's brief about the magnitude of harm to the
industry is extra-record citation. There are 26 billion
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then perhaps there should be
a trial so it would all come out.
MR. TARANTO: Petitioners -- it's not just that
they didn't have it in their brief, they did not submit
any evidence in response to the summary-judgment motion
that said the rule of Sony should be applied here because
the magnitude of the injury to the recording industry or
in -- someday in the future, to the movie industry is X.
Zero evidence --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they weren't
concentrating on the damage to them, they were
concentrating on the facilitation of copying that was
provided. And you don't question that this service does
facilitate copying.
MR. TARANTO: As does the personal computer and
the modem and the Internet service provider and the
Microsoft operating system. There's -- everything in the
chain that makes this work is absolutely essential to
facilitating the copying. The question is which pieces,
if any, and under what standard, get singled out for a
judicially fashioned secondary copyright liability
doctrine.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you said -- I think you
were saying -- this is something for Congress to solve;
it's not for the Court. But the Court is now faced with
two apparently conflicting decisions: Aimster, in the
Seventh Circuit, the Ninth Circuit decision. And if
you're just looking at this in the abstract, you might
say, "Well, it's -- isn't it odd that Napster goes one way
in the Ninth Circuit, and this case goes another way?"
MR. TARANTO: Let me suggest why that's not odd
and why the cases are not just different, but critically
different. Napster rests -- never mind the exact words of
the opinion -- Napster involves something more than
distribution of a product. Napster, the company, was
sending out, in response to requests, "Where is this
filed," an answer, the information, "The file is here."
Every time it sent out that information, if it had been
told by Mr. Verrilli's client, "That file may not be
shared," it was, with specific knowledge to that file,
giving assistance. That is a classic contributory
infringement case based on specific knowledge of
infringement. And the reason --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't this a classic
willful-ignorance case?
MR. TARANTO: Because willful ignorance is about
having possession of information and refusing to look at
it. This -- that does not occur here. This tool of
autonomous communication is one in which there is no
mother-may-I system, no chaperone, no information provided
to us at the time that there is any request. When I ask
for a file from you, there is no information that goes
back to StreamCast or to Grokster --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but I thought willful
ignorance was basically a certainty of what was going on
without empirically verifying it, so as to, sort of,
maintain the guise of one's hands over one's eyes. And it
seems to me, if that's what it is, that's what we've got.
MR. TARANTO: No, I don't think so, I think, on
either account. My understanding of where in the law
willful ignorance has bite is when you do have the
information right in front of you, and you refuse to look
at it. And, what's more, the change of system to an
autonomous communication tool, where there is no
intermediary, which is what all of their filtering systems
would require, getting permission in advance, the change
of tool is not just some way of blinding oneself to the
information.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I think it would also
include disabling yourself from looking at it. And so, I
think it's an important part of your case, that you didn't
adopt this new system of decentralizing the file so that
it's in the computers, out there, solely in order to get
around Napster.
MR. TARANTO: Right. And I think that the
summary-judgment record on this is -- it, I mean, doesn't
leave any real room for dispute. Seeking --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, wait. In respect to that
-- I mean, is it open? If you win on the question of the
standard, is it open, or would we have to remand it for
them to argue, in light of the history, in light of what
they do now, they, your client, with knowledge of
infringement, actively encouraged users to infringe
copyright using their -- using the Grokster technology,
and, indeed, knowingly would include willful blindness?
MR. TARANTO: I think --
JUSTICE BREYER: Because -- as I had gotten that
from one of these amicus briefs, you know, that's their
standard -- they say a willful -- of willful, deliberate
inducement. And that, it seems to me, important that they
be able to argue that. Now, can they argue it, in your
opinion, if we do nothing but affirm the Ninth Circuit?
MR. TARANTO: I think that they can certainly
argue, with an affirmance by this Court, that all of the
past acts, to use the District Court's term, constitute a
basis for a -- inducement liability. There would be some
legal questions about whether there is such a thing as
inducement liability, but they get to argue that. No
remand is required for that.
The record in this case establishes that one
reason for going to the decentralized system, without a
central index and a third-party intermediary, was to --
was a reaction to the Ninth Circuit's Napster decision
that said, "That's a legal problem." But it is also, I
think, beyond genuine dispute, for summary-judgment
proposes, that there were other reasons. You don't have
to have the servers to maintain. When StreamCast, in
particular, was running a Napster-like system, the so-
called openNap system, it had ten servers, and quickly
maxed out and started crashing, and immediately concluded
-- I think this is at page 789 or -- and 798 of the joint
appendix -- we would have had to start doubling, tripling,
quadrupling the number of services, and we didn't have --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Taranto --
MR. TARANTO: -- the money to do it.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- can I ask -- I'm still a
little puzzled about the posture of the case.
--
MR. TARANTO: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Because I read the District
Court opinion. I think he said -- the judge said that
both parties agreed that there were no disputed issues of
fact that would preclude the entry of summary judgment in
either way, no disputed issues relative to whether to
grant relief. And I -- it's on page 24a of the cert
petition. And I understand you to be saying that leaving
everything alone, affirming would allow the case to go
forward with your adversaries seeking damages on an
active-inducement theory. Am I correct?
MR. TARANTO: Yes. I think -- all I read this,
page 24a, to say is that both sides filed for summary
judgment, so each one, of course, thought that there was
-- that it was entitled to summary judgment. Each --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it says, "Both parties
believe there are no disputed issues of fact material to
Defendant's liability."
MR. TARANTO: I think that's just because each
side filed summary judgment. Each side filed extensive
JUSTICE STEVENS: So then your answer to my
question is that, yes, if we affirm, as a possibility,
they could continue to seek damages on an active-
inducement theory.
MR. TARANTO: Yes, absolutely. And there are --
there are affirmative defenses that are not even part of
this motion that, of course, would, by themselves,
preclude summary judgment in their favor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And then one other --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- question I had. Does the
record contain their proposed form of injunction that they
requested?
MR. TARANTO: I don't think it does, beyond the
statement at the end of their summary-judgment pleading
that asked for a very general injunction, "Stop the
Defendants from infringing." I'm not aware of anything
more specific.
Let me comment a bit on what the record says
about the substantial legitimate uses. This is not a
question of simply saying --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Taranto, before you go
back to that, I wanted to be clear on what you were saying
would be left over for trial.
MR. TARANTO: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because, as I read your
briefing, it was, "Well, they can argue about some bad
things that Grokster was doing in the past, but this
decision says: henceforth, what we're doing is okay. The
case zeroed in on now and the future, and the only thing
that was left open was something that is over and gone
could get damages for it." But I thought that this
judgment gave you an okay, a green light, from now on.
MR. TARANTO: I -- my view that -- I mean, this
was not talked about in these terms. I believe it ought
to be open to the Petitioners, not only to prove that past
acts were, themselves, illegal, but that the causal
consequence of those past acts should somehow reach
forward into the current acts.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is the point of the
current summary judgment?
MR. TARANTO: The point of the current summary
judgment is that there is -- the forward-looking
character of the activities taking place, starting in
September 2002 on forward, has been held, by itself, not
to be a basis for --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying the summary
judgment simply, in effect, says, "They're not doing
anything wrong now, but we have left open the question,
not merely of what they have done wrong in the past, but
whether what they did wrong in the past can carry forward
into the future"?
MR. TARANTO: As I say, it wasn't stated in
those terms, but, yes, I think that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's bizarre.
MR. TARANTO: Well, I don't think so, because --
[Laughter.]
MR. TARANTO: -- because the important question
is, to the Petitioners, the entire recording and movie
industry, Is this set of activities, which you and I,
tomorrow, can start engaging in, one that they can stop?
There are literally a handful -- on page 7 and 8 of their
brief --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying -- what it
really says is, "There's nothing to enjoin, but there may
very well be something to recover for," --
MR. TARANTO: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- "even as to future
activity."
MR. TARANTO: Yes, exactly right. And they
would, of course, have had to make the very implausible
assertion, in a business in which there is no plausible
lock-in, that somehow a set of isolated events -- e-mails
-- a handful of e-mails out of literally, between the two
companies, 1700 a day, that might have said, "Why don't
you load some music up"? -- are somehow the causal -- the
cause of what is going on today.
Let me say a few words about what the record
says about legitimate activities. Altnet is a company --
this is at 1169 and -70 of the joint appendix -- they say
that they have distributed, on peer-to-peer systems,
hundreds of thousands of authorized songs, and, they say,
millions of pieces of -- of video games, leading to sales.
This is not a trivial number. JIVE, at page 67 to 68,
speaks about 250,000 peer-to-peer downloads of a music
video. The Internet archive, which is talked about in the
record, and if you now look at what they are on their
Website, now lists some several hundred musical artists
with 20,000 recordings which are being put out there for
peer-to-peer distribution. The Creative Commons is
licensing all kinds of things for authorized public
distribution. There are musical bands --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Because, I gather, that some
artists don't make money from the records, but make money
from the popularity that draws fans to their concerts.
MR. TARANTO: My understanding --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So they're willing to give away
the records for free.
MR. TARANTO: -- my understanding is "some" is a
great understatement, yes.
The bands talked about at 159 and 169 to '70 of
the joint appendix, which have authorized their live
concert recordings to be traded among -- on -- to be
traded. The GigAmerica business is in the business of
compiling -- this is at 323 of the joint appendix -- of
compiling musical recordings and other things for
authorized distribution. The world of music distribution
and video distribution and movie-trailer distribution and,
in small instances now, text distribution, but growing, is
changing and making use of this extremely innovative, low-
cost tool. The great innovation of this tool of
communication --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Taranto?
MR. TARANTO: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: In your motion for
summary judgment, did you ask that the Plaintiff's claim
be dismissed?
MR. TARANTO: Well, we asked for judgment, in
our favor on their claim, that our current activities
constituted a basis for secondary liability. I'm not sure
if word "dismiss" was --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Were there other
claims? You said "on their claim." Were -- did they make
other claims?
MR. TARANTO: They had a generic claim about
secondary copyright liability. We made the motion -- or,
actually, StreamCast made a motion that said, "Let's carve
this piece out and talk just about whether the set of
current activities supports secondary liability." The
other side eventually agreed that that was distinct and
severable from their claim of secondary liability as to
past acts and as to past versions of the software, which
has -- which has changed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does one find that?
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: (Inaudible)
MR. TARANTO: Yes, the motion -- well, it -- the
simplest place, I guess, is in the June 2003 District
Court ruling, which is in the Joint Appendix and attached
to the brief in opposition, ruled on the Petitioner's
motion for an interlocutory appeal under 1292.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the motion itself is not
there to take it through the opinion of the Court?
MR. TARANTO: No, the motion is not -- is not in
the joint appendix. The -- most of the motions -- in
fact, both of our summary-judgment motions and their
summary-judgment motion, are in the joint excerpts of
record in the Ninth Circuit, can be found in --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The text on --
MR. TARANTO: -- 30 volumes.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: -- the text, on pages
a and 24a, gives the impression that the District Court
is disposing of the entire case.
MR. TARANTO: That -- it may give that
impression on those pages. Later, the Court explains that
it's ruling only on the current versions of the software.
And then in the June 2003 order, the Court was explicit in
saying, "If I haven't been clear enough, let me amend my
June -- my April order," which is what you were just
reading from, "to make explicit the limitation." And we
quote that in our brief.
The great virtue of peer-to-peer decentralized
software is that it doesn't require anybody to put stuff
onto a server and then bear the cost of bandwidth, of
being charged by the Internet service provider when a
million people suddenly want it. It automatically scales.
It -- the more people who want it, the more people will
have it, because it will be out there on a million
computers. That is an inherent distributional economy,
together with the autonomy of the user, rather than having
a kind of Mother-may-I system, with having to check every
communication through some third party to say, "Am I
authorized to make this communication," that are the
virtues of this system and that make it clearly capable of
growing the already large hundreds of thousands, even
millions, of uses that this -- that these pieces of
software already enable people to do.
One final -- final word. We're not disputing
that there are, in an industry-wide way, a set of
important policy issues here, though there's nothing in
the record about what self-help measures -- digital-rights
management, encryption, other things -- there's nothing in
the record what -- about that. There's nothing in the
record about what kinds of real industry harm is being
done by this. Right? This is all citations to Websites
in their brief. These are classic questions of predictive
judgment, industry-wide judgments that Congress should
make to decide whether there is a problem in need of
solution, and what solutions ought to be considered,
whether changing the rule would have a overriding bad
effect on other industries. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
Taranto.
Mr. Verrilli, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I'd like to start by clarifying the inducement
issue, and then explain why inducement is not enough, and
then have a word, if I might, about the reality of this
case.
The reason, Justice Souter, you find it bizarre
is because a shell game is going on here. What the
Respondent's position -- excuse me -- the Respondent's
position here is that we can sue for specific
infringements that we can show were induced by these
specific acts, such as e-mail support. Our position on
inducement is that we are entitled to injunctive relief
against the continued operation of this gigantic
infringement machine, which was built by the inducement.
Now, I think that the Respondents have quite
clearly said that they're -- they don't think any
injunctive relief is available, going forward. But we're
entitled, under Section 502 of the Copyright Act, to
effective relief, not merely a -- relief, judgment
relief, that says, "Go and sin no more," but relief that
undoes the consequences of this inducement, of this
massive effort to build a gigantic engine of infringement.
And that is why they're just wrong about that.
And you certainly can't affirm the Ninth Circuit
and allow us to go forward with anything like that theory,
because the Ninth Circuit said the only thing we can sue
for -- the only thing we can sue for -- is a situation in
which we can show that we had knowledge of specific acts
of infringement at a time when we could stop those
specific acts of infringement. So there's just no way to
affirm and let that go forward.
Now, why is infringement -- why is inducement
not enough? It's not enough because, as Justice Scalia
suggested, these companies already operate in the shadows,
and a ruling here, which would be, I submit, a significant
cutback of the Sony rule, that inducement is the only
available ground of liability, would just leave them to
paper over -- you know, we do have some paper evidence
here, a paper trail here, but that'll just -- they just
won't exist next time. And it's just -- it's just not
enough.
And I submit that Sony was quite clear on this.
Sony said that the staple article-of-commerce doctrine,
not copyright law, generally, and not secondary liability,
generally, but the staple article-of-commerce doctrine,
the noninducement part of the analysis, has got to strike
an effective balance -- a real balance that provides
effective protection of copyright, as well as protecting
unrelated lines of commerce.
Now, their rule is a rule of immunity. It's a
free pass. It says, all you've got to do is speculate
about noninfringing use, and you can continue with
infringement, ad infinitum. And that's not a rule that
protects innovation; that's a rule that destroys
innovation. It certainly destroys the innovation that the
creators of the copyright law is supposed to protect, and
that's supposed to be the effective protection part of the
balance that Sony said this law is supposed to strike.
It also -- it also deters legitimate
technological innovation moving towards legitimate means
of distributing this -- of distributing, in a digital
format, music and movies through the kinds of companies
that filed amicus briefs and that are trying to do this
legitimately. They are inevitably and invariably undercut
by the kinds of businesses that Respondents and the others
run, so it deters innovation; it doesn't move it forward.
And, beyond that, Justice Kennedy, as you
suggested, it isn't just that they get to use our
copyrighted -- the value of our copyrighted materials as
the seed capital, that's the whole business. That is the
whole business. And that's the reality here, and that's
the problem. They can talk about the hundreds of
thousands, or maybe even millions, of uses, but the
reality is that there are 2.6 billion downloads,
unlawfully, every month. So what they're talking about as
lawful is a tiny, teeny little fraction of what's really
going on here.
And the problem with the rule which they say is
a clear rule, but it obviously isn't in Sony, because Sony
said, "strike a balance." And the problem with that rule,
Your Honor, is that it gives them a perpetual license to
keep going forward with billions and billions of unlawful
downloads a month. They never have to do anything to try
to bring their conduct into conformity with law. They're
not in the position of that inventor that you identified,
Justice Scalia, who has to, sort of, think through, "What
am I doing?" They're just in a position where they have
every economic incentive in the world to maximize the
number of infringing uses, because they make more money
when they do so.
Now, and with respect to the reality of this
situation, let me just say -- and I must beg to differ,
Justice Breyer, with the suggestion that this industry is
thriving. What the -- the facts are that we have lost --
the recording industry has lost 25 percent of its revenue
since the onslaught of these services. And that's
particularly critical, because, remember, this is really
-- the recording business, in particular, is really a
venture-capital business. Most of the records we put out
don't make money. A few make a lot of money. Well, what
do you think's getting traded on Grokster and StreamCast
and the rest of them? It's the few that make all the
money. So they're draining all of the money out of the
system that we use to find new artists and --
