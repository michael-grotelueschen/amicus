of Dental Examiners v. The Federal Trade Commission.
Mr. Mooppan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HASHIM M. MOOPPAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. MOOPPAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
A State regulatory agency does not lose its
State action antitrust immunity simply because the
agency is run by part-time public officials who are also
market participants in their personal capacities.
The FTC's contrary position that the
agency's officials must be disinterested cannot be
reconciled with this Court's jurisprudence for three
reasons:  First, respect for federalism requires
deference to a State's sovereign choices concerning how
to structure and manage its own regulatory agencies.
Second, the regulatory conduct of public officials who
are also market participants cannot properly be equated
with the conduct of private businesspeople.  And third,
the FTC's position would be massively and needlessly
disrupted.
States obtain valuable benefits from using
market participants as part-time public officials.  They
gain the benefits of their expertise and they gain the
benefits of not having to have a full-time bureaucracy
with a full salary.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is thisit -- is it a question
of Federal law or a question of State law whether the
members of -- whether this board is a State
instrumentality?
MR. MOOPPAN:  Ultimately whether this board
should be entitled to State action immunity is a
question of Federal law.  But in characterizing the
board as public or private, we submit that absent
extraordinary circumstances, the Federal court should
treat a State's designation of a State entity as public,
and that when that entity is charged with public duties
as a State entity.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if you agree that a
State can't simply deem something that for all other
purposes is private to be a State entity or
instrumentality, there has to be some test.  So what
would the test be?
MR. MOOPPAN:  So we think the -- the
fundamental key is that it's not just that they're
designated as State officials but they are charged with
a State law duty to enforce State law.  They are not
acting pursuant to their unfettered private discretion
to choose whatever -- whatever choices maximize their
personal profit.  They are obligated --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Here, in this case, they
didn't enforce State law.  One puzzle in this case:  Why
should there be an antitrust exemption for conduct that
is not authorized by state law?  The objection here was
that this board was issuing a whole bunch of cease and
desist orders.  They had no authority to do that.  No
authority at all.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, two points about that,
Your Honor.  First, it's not quite right to say that
this board didn't have authority to issue these letters.
It is true that the board doesn't have authority to
issue self-executing orders akin to an injunction, but
it is also true that the board has authority to send
letters to prospective non-dentists saying that if you
don't cease and desist your conduct, we will sue you.
The only question in this case in terms of
State law authority is whether the wording of these
letters was somehow problematic.  No State court has
ever determined that that is a problem, and more
fundamentally, all of that is a question about whether
there is a clear articulation here, and the FTC has
assumed that there is a clear articulation.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Mooppan, can I take you
back to Justice Alito's question, because I think you
said in response that the question -- that the answer
was has the State asked the organization to enforce
State law and given -- entrusted them with that
responsibility.
So suppose a State just looked around and
found a trade association and said we think that that
trade association is going to be a very good enforcer of
State law, and made the trade association a State
entity.  That's the board that's going to regulate this
industry.  Would that be sufficient?
MR. MOOPPAN:  If they had a State -- if they
took an oath to the State to enforce State law, if they
were subject to the traditional duties that a public
entity has, if they had to comply with the
Administrative Procedures Act and the open records rules
and the ethics laws, if they were subject to judicial
review, absolutely.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, which of those are the
important ones?  Do all of them have to be there?
MR. MOOPPAN:  We think the absolute key is
that they're subject to a State law duty, that they have
sworn an oath to the State to enforce State law and not
to maximize their own private --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I don't buy -- I -- I
think in the trade association case, I get off your
train.  It seems to me it's quite different to appoint
a -- what should I say -- an entity that is already a
conglomerate, which is already a contract or combination
of individuals, and to authorize that separately created
combination of individuals to enforce State law.  I
think that's quite different from saying we're going to
have a board composed of dentists and we're going to
pick the dentists.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, it is different, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And they are serving only
in their individual capacity on this board, whereas the
people in the trade association you're talking about
are -- I guess the governors of the trade association
are elected by the members; right?
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, but that's the key, Your
Honor.  I agree it is a more difficult case, but if the
State law hasd basically drafted a private trade
association and said:  You will serve two hats;
sometimes you will act as a private trade association
but sometimes you will be the entity of the State that
is responsible for enforcing State law.  You have a
State law oath to enforce State law.  You cannot take
your actions to maximize your private gain.  What you're
doing here is enforcing State law.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, my goodness, there's
a lot of cases.  I would have thought it was
well-established that if, in fact, the State says to a
group of wine merchants, you go fix your own wine
prices, be sure they're reasonable; or to a group of
truckers, you go set your own trucking prices but be
sure they're reasonable, et cetera, et cetera, that they
can do that if, and only if, there is supervision.  And
because, you know, they might get out of hand, the wine
merchants or the truckers or anybody else.
Now, I started from that proposition.  You
seem to be questioning that proposition.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Not at all, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If we accept
that proposition, then how is your case any different?
Because what we have here is we have a group of dentists
like the group of wine merchants, like the group of
truckers, and of course they're not fixing prices, what
they're doing is deciding who will be in the business
and there we are, end of case.  Is there supervision,
yes or no?  The FTC says, no, there isn't, and I want to
know what you say to that.
MR. MOOPPAN:  The fundamental difference
between the hypothetical you posed and this case is that
when you have private people who are authorized to set
their own prices, even if the State statute says they
must be reasonable, they are exercising their discretion
about what is reasonable in terms of maximizing their
personal profit.  They are not acting as fiduciaries of
the State.  They have no obligation to the State.  They
have not sworn an oath to the State.  They're not
subject to the State's administrative procedures --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  Well, we put
all that in.  We put all that in.  We say our truckers
and our wine merchants swear an oath.  I swear that I am
a member now of the State commission setting prices and
I swear that I will be reasonable.  Okay?
You think that would have changed the Midcal
result?
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, since those are
essentially the facts of Parker I do think it would
actually change the result.  The commission in Parker --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What happened?  All that
happened is they take an oath.  For all I know, maybe
the Midcal wine people did take an oath.
MR. MOOPPAN:  They didnâ€™t and --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Suppose I say I
don't think that's --
MR. MOOPPAN:  It is no small thing --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- is there anything else?
MR. MOOPPAN:  Huh?
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there anything else
besides the oath?  Is this case identical to Midcal
except they -- they took an oath?
MR. MOOPPAN:  No.  So compared to Midcal
there was literally no substantive standard whatsoever
in the California statute.  They were free to set
whatever price they want, not even a reasonableness
constraint.
In addition, not only is there the oath,
there's the fact that they are subject to all of the
traditional duties that public entities have.  They have
to comply with the APA, the State ethics rules, open
meetings rules, public records laws.  None of that
was --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why is it entirely
reasonable to say, yes, this can be a State actor, but
because they are made at the same time the State says
they must be in private practice.  So they're both the
State actor and they're private actor.
So yes, you can have such a board, but there
needs to be a check of supervision; that is, they can't
just go make their regulations without approval from
some State entity and they can't go around issuing cease
and desist orders.  They have to come to a court.  If
they want to -- and the court would act as the check.
Why shouldn't -- because of the risk that
these people have the self-interest, why shouldn't there
be a check of the kind that Midcal --
MR. MOOPPAN:  Because, fundamentally, it is
a question for the State to determine whether it wants
to bear that risk.  These are the State's officials and
the State has made a different choice.  The State has
decided that the benefits of having market participants
make decisions and not having their every -- each and
every decision actively second-guessed by a higher level
of bureaucracy is worth it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- it really begs
the question, if we give immunity because only when we
have a clearly defined State intent, a policy accepted
and created by the State, what -- how is the State doing
that when all it's doing is letting dentists elect the
representatives of their board?  This is not an
appointed position.  This is an elected position by
dentists of each other.
How is the State going to be any different
in giving that group of private actors a pass on
antitrust litigation that -- when they have a
self-interest that's inherent in their occupation?
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, the State gets involved
at the front end in two ways.  First, there has to be a
clearly articulated anticompetitive policy, and in this
case --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what is that clearly
articulated policy?
MR. MOOPPAN:  In this case it's been assumed
by the FTC that that is satisfied here.  What I would
submit is the reason it exists is because the Dental
Practice Act says that only licensed dentists can
practice dentistry.  That is on its face inherently
anticompetitive.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is there any clear
policy that teeth whitening is the practice of
dentistry?  I thought that that was determined before --
the standard about removing stains on teeth, that that
was before anybody ever knew about whitening.
MR. MOOPPAN:  That's an interpretative
question under the statute.  And what this Court has
held in cases like Omni is application of a clearly
articulated State policy is a question for State
administrator review.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But how can it be clearly
articulated when the problem being addressed didn't even
exist when the -- when the policy was --
MR. MOOPPAN:  For the same reason that in
Omni, for example.  The State had authorized zoning, but
they hadn't asked whether the particular ordinance
passed in Omni was complying with substantive and
procedural law.  And what this Court held is once you
have at the threshold a statute that authorizes the
displacement of competition, how public officials
implement that statute is a question for State
administrative review.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does The Federal government,
the FTC and the Sherman Act have an interest in ensuring
that regulators do not pursue their self-interest?.
MR. MOOPPAN:  They do not.  That is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's inconsistent then
with what we said in Hallie.  The City of Hallie, we
said this is not a case in which we are concerned with
entities pursuing their self-interest because it's the
city.
MR. MOOPPAN:  I don't think that -- Your
Honor, with all respect, I don't think that's the
correct interpretation of Hallie.  I think if you look
at that paragraph in its entirety the sentence
immediately prior to the sentence you just quoted said
that the risk that we're worried about is that the State
is circumventing the Federal antitrust laws.
The concern was not that the officials were
going to act contrary to the State's interest.  The
concern was that the State was just authorizing them to
violate Federal law.  What -- and then two sentences
after the sentence you just read, what the Court said is
if the concern is that they have parochial interests,
we'll work -- clear articulation solves that problem.
But if there's any ambiguity about where --
what Hallie says on this it's resolved by Omni, because
if ever there were a case where the State's officials
had the self-interest, where they might have been acting
contrary to the State's own interest, it's when the
State's officials are being bribed by private parties.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Mooppan, could we -- you
have to explain that understanding of Hallie to me.  And
Hallie is a very important case because it essentially
asks the question that's right here, which is we have
this odd entity and we have to decide whether that
entity is more like just private parties or is more like
a prototypical State actor.  And there we say it's more
like a prototypical State actor.
And how do we get there?  We say the
requirement of active State supervision is a way of
ensuring that the actor is engaging in the challenged
conduct pursuant to State policy.  And we need to have
that test, we need to have that test when there's a real
danger that the party is acting to further his own
interest but not when there is not such a danger.
And here that suggests that the question is:
Is this party, this board of all dentists, is there a
danger that it's acting to further its own interests
rather than the governmental interests of the State?
And that seems almost self-evidently to be true.
MR. MOOPPAN:  With all due respect, Your
Honor, I think you've skipped a sentence in Hallie.  In
between the first sentence and the second sentence you
read me there is a sentence that says the rest -- the
purpose of the active supervision requirement is to
prevent the State from circumventing the Sherman Act.
The danger that the Court was talking about in the
sentence you read is the danger that the State is just
authorizing private people to violate Federal law rather
than having its own State policy.
And that is what the Court meant in Hallie
when they said there was no danger.  There is no danger
that the State create a municipality as an elaborate
sham to let private people violate Federal law under the
auspices of a municipality.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the concern is that
there is no State policy if the State simply says we --
you take an oath and then you do what you want.  And if
the board says we think what's good for dentistry is
good for South -- good for North Carolina, our cases say
that's not enough because you're pursuing your
self-interest.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, that's true, Your Honor,
because there the statute says do what you want.  But
that's not what the statute here says, and a statute
that says do what you want wouldn't be a clearly
articulated policy to displace competition.
Here what the statute says is only licensed
dentists can practice dentistry.  That is a clearly
articulated policy to displace competition, and the only
question is whether the State's officials have properly
implemented that statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is a statute
that says do what you want not clearly articulated?
MR. MOOPPAN:  Because it's neutral.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It says clearly --
do what you want so long as it promotes the dental --
monopoly of dentists.
MR. MOOPPAN:  If it said do what you want to
promote the monopoly of dentists, I guess at that point
it would be a clearly articulated policy to displace
competition.  In a circumstance like that where all that
was at issue was a broad standard to do whatever was
best for the dental practice and there were private
parties and they were subject to no other type of
judicial constraints, maybe that would be the sort of
situation --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's not enough
just to say, oh, you're a public agent or you're a
public official.
MR. MOOPPAN:  As I said to Justice Alito at
the outset, in extraordinary circumstances perhaps this
Court could say that what has been deemed a public
agency by the State is essentially a sham, but this is
far from that.  The board in this case is structured
like -- the work of the board in this case is
accomplished like every other State agency.  It is
subject to the administrative procedures rules, it's
subject to public records laws, it's subject to
ethics --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But none of that's
responsive to the concern that the State policy is
purely to displace competition by promoting the
self-interest of the dentist.
MR. MOOPPAN:  It's response --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They can do that in
open meeting.  They can do that with let anyone look at
the records but --
MR. MOOPPAN:  It's responsive to the fact
that if these people are acting contrary to the State's
interest, the State can deal with it and the State has
chosen to deal with it in a certain way.  And the
fundamental question in this case is does Federal law
second-guess how the State has chosen to deal with this
problem.  And what we know from cases like Omni --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The antitrust exemption
is a matter of State law -- of Federal law, not State
law.  So it's -- the Federal law sets the dimensions of
what fits within the State action.  It's not up to the
State to create the State action exemption.  It's
Federal law and what its metes and bounds are are also
Federal law.
MR. MOOPPAN:  That's true, but the line that
this Court has consistently drawn from Parker onwards is
that the Sherman Act does not apply to the acts of
States or their officials when implementing laws
directed by the legislature.  And absent extraordinary
circumstances, I would think that Congress did not
intend for Federal courts to second-guess whether a
public entity is really private. That would flip
federalism on its head.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Tell me if I'm wrong
about this, but I thought that the State action
exemption was adopted and announced by this Court.
MR. MOOPPAN:  It was.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that's nothing
spelled out in a -- in a law.
MR. MOOPPAN:  It was adopted by this Court.
It's a version of a more general clear statement rule
that this Court has consistently applied, that we
don't -- the Court does not assume that Congress lightly
intends to intrude on courts' sovereign prerogatives.
It's just like cases like Gregory v. Ashcroft.  What the
Court said in Parker is nothing in the Sherman Act's
text or history indicates any intent to interfere with
sovereign State regulation, and therefore, States are
not subject to the Sherman Act.
And the question in this case is when you
have a State entity, that the State has labeled as a
State entity -- but not just labeled, charged with a
duty and subjected to all the duties that State agencies
normally have --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there's -- there's
another factor that the State has stipulated, that is,
the State has said "and the members of this board must
be private practitioners."  That -- that is not your
typical State agency.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, it actually is the
typical way of regulating the professions.  Every State
medical board, every State dental board --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And may be so, and that's
why the FTC says we need a check, we need the Midcal
check of some genuine State supervision over private --
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, I would submit it would
cut the other direction, that we should -- we would
require very clear intent that Congress intended to --
to oversee and regulate the most traditional way of
regulating the professions that States have historically
used and have consistently used for a long time.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What would happen if the
North Carolina courts were to interpret the North
Carolina statute that says that removing stains from
teeth is the practice of dentistry, to apply to
whitening?  What would -- what would that mean for this
case?  Because that seems -- that's an unanswered
question, isn't it?  An unanswered question of -- of
North Carolina law.
MR. MOOPPAN:  It is an open question.  If
they were to interpret it to say that it was the
practice of dentistry?
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, I'm not sure what it
would have to do -- the effect it would have on this
case, because the FTC has already assumed that we are
satisfied the clear articulation requirement.  I assume
it would make their case harder on remand to dispute
that we were acting pursuant to clearly articulated
policy.
But in terms of going forward, whether we --
the board is correct about the meaning of the State
statute is a question of State administrative review.
If the State courts were to reach the opposite
conclusion, then the board would have to stop this
enforcement practice and they could be sued in State
court if they did.
The fundamental question here is whether
Federal courts need to second guess these State
administrative questions.  Just like in Omni, it was
possible that the zoning ordinance that the city council
promulgated in Omni was in violation of State law.
There were all sorts of substantive and procedural
requirements that needed to be followed, and this Court
didn't ask whether any of those things were satisfied.
This Court said that that is a question for State
administrator review, not for Federal antitrust law,
because the Sherman Act was never intended to supplant
State administrative review.  That would turn federalism
on its head.
And again, I would like to emphasize that
that was in the context of city council officials who
were allegedly being bribed.  If city council officials
who are allegedly being bribed are entitled to immunity,
I find it very difficult to understand how the
mere existence --
JUSTICE BREYER:  The obvious difference is
that city council officials are State officials, and a
local wine merchant is a local wine merchant.  He is not
a State official.  That's the obvious difference.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, but these -- these are
not just local wine merchants.  These are people who --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's your other argument.
You can -- I can understand your argument as saying, no,
there's enough Stateness in this that they become State
officials.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's an argument I
understand.
MR. MOOPPAN:  So the -- let me --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't understand how Omni
supports you because there they were clearly not private
people.  I mean, they weren't private merchants.  The
evil we are trying to get at was not present.
MR. MOOPPAN:  I guess the fundamental key is
that I don't really take the FTC to be disputing that
these are public officials.  What they are saying is
they are public officials who have a conflict of
interest.  They're saying that they're not disinterested
public officials.
They're not saying that they're actually
private people.  They're not saying that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's say they have to be
because they are, by State law, they must be private
practitioners.  They cannot be full-time civil servants.
MR. MOOPPAN:  They are --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They can't be on this
board unless you are a regularly practicing dentist.
MR. MOOPPAN:  They are also private people.
They serve -- they have two hats.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Just that they're private
people.  The object of the antitrust laws is to prevent
private individuals who compete with each other in
business from getting together and making agreements.
That kind of interest seems present here, present in
Midcal, and present in all the other cases, but not
present in Hallie.  Because in Hallie they were private,
yes, but they're not businesspeople about to make
agreements with each other in the sense that the
antitrust law is concerned.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, two points about that,
Your Honor.  First of all, in Parker, the people on the
commission were, in fact, market participants, and yet
this Court still treated that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  If you don't -- you might
not agree with my analysis, and -- and go on with this
because I'll work that one out.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Okay.  So in setting aside
Parker, I think the more fundamental point is the -- the
Federal antitrust laws shouldn't be interpreted to
second guess whether a public official is really private
just because they have a conflict of interest.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do we set aside
Goldfarb?
MR. MOOPPAN:  No.  Goldfarb, the basis --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Goldfarb says the fact
that the State bars the statesame agency for some limited
purpose does not create an antitrust shield that allows
it to foster anticompetitive practices of the benefit to
its members.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Absolutely.  Goldfarb -- what
you need in addition is a clearly articulated policy of
displaced competition.  That was lacking in Goldfarb as
the Court explained in Goldfarb and has reaffirmed in
cases like Southern Motor Carriers, and it is present
here and the FTC doesn't dispute -- or at least for
present purposes that it is present here.
The question in this case, unlike in
Goldfarb, is whether a board that has public -- that has
market participants on it are entitled to immunity even
when enforcing a clearly articulated policy of displaced
competition.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Mooppan, the two
prongs of Midcal are supposed to operate in tandem with
each other.  They both have a role to play in ensuring
that an actor is in accord with the State policy and is
not acting solely to further his own interest.
So the first prong comes along and says
here's what -- there needs to be a State policy, and
then the second prong -- because we understand that that
policy is not going to answer all questions.  There are
going to be lots of little things that the actor does,
and the question is going to be are you acting in accord
with that State policy or not.  And then there needs to
be some supervision to ensure that the actor is acting
in accord with State policy.
So to strip the second half of the test off
is to leave the first half of the test essentially --
you know, "meaningless" might be too strong, but
unprotected.  There's no way to make sure that the
people are acting in accord with State policy rather
than to serve their own interests.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Your Honor, I just
fundamentally don't think that that is the point of the
second prong.  The point -- the concern that you are
articulating, the way to solve that problem is through
State administrator review.  That's what Omni held.  If
there's a -- if there's a possibility that State
officials are misapplying State law, are deviating from
State policy, that can be solved through State
administrator review, and Federal antitrust law was
never intended to second guess that question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When you --
MR. MOOPPAN:  What active supervision is
intended to do instead is to prevent the State from
authorizing private people to violate Federal law, even
if that's what the State wants.  Take a case like
Midcal, the economical act of supervision case.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think all over,
Mr. Mooppan, it's in Patrick v. Burget, it's in other
cases, that the act of supervision prong is -- is to
make sure that the action is the State's own, it's in
accord with the State's policy.  That's what it's doing.
MR. MOOPPAN:  By State's own, what the Court
meant is they are not just authorizing private people to
act illegally.  Take a case like Midcal where the State
said, go set prices.  No substantive standard
whatsoever.  There was no reason to think that the
private people were acting contrary to the State policy
because the State just wanted to let them fix prices.
The point of active supervision in a case
like Midcal is to make sure that private parties are not
just being authorized the power to violate Federal law
because private parties are presumptively subject to
Federal law and the only way they can get immunity is if
their actions are made the State's own by the State's
supervision.  That is not necessary when the State has
already made their conduct their own by making them
public officials and charging them with the State law
duty to enforce State law.
If I can reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Stewart.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
If the dental board were designated a
private agency, this would be a paradigmatic case
illustrating the reasons that active supervision is
required.  The board members, the majority of them at
least, are required to be practicing dentists, they have
an evident self-interest in the manner in which the
dental profession is regulated and in regulations that
might keep other people from competing with dentists.
That natural self-interest is reinforced by
the method of selection.  North Carolina law provides
that the members of this dental board will be selected
not by the governor or by the public, but by the
community of dentists.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You are not suggesting, or
are you, that that's critical to your case?
MR. STEWART:  We're not saying that that's
critical.  That's simply a --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's just like an add-on
feature.
MR. STEWART:  That's right.  And -- and
that's the way the commission treated it in its opinion.
The commission didn't suggest that the outcome would
have been different if the method of selection had been
different.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you do about a
State supreme court that sets the ethics rules for the
legal profession, including what constitutes the
unauthorized practice of law?  And let's assume the
State has a requirement that all members of the State
supreme court have to be lawyers.  What do you do about
that?
MR. STEWART:  I mean, this is essentially
Goldfarb.  Goldfarb involved the Virginia Bar, it was
designated as a State agency as a matter of law.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not talking about the
Virginia Bar.  I'm talking about the Supreme Court of
Virginia.
MR. STEWART:  The Court in Goldfarb --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are you going to say the
Supreme Court of Virginia has to be actively supervised?
MR. STEWART:  No, the Supreme Court of
Virginia -- the Supreme Court of any State, like the
State legislature, speaks for the State itself.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They are all lawyers.
MR. STEWART:  And that is simply an
unavoidable exception, if you will, to the general
requirement --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they are not
practicing lawyers?
MR. STEWART:  They are not practicing
lawyers.  Whatever marginal self-interest they might
have is outweighed by their status as supreme court bar
-- as supreme court justices.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Presumably they also
set judicial ethics rules.
MR. STEWART:  They would set judicial ethics
rules.  But what I was saying about Goldfarb is that
Goldfarb dealt with the relationship between what the
Virginia Supreme Court did and what the Virginia Bar
did.  And it said, of course, the Virginia -- the ethics
rules promulgated by the Virginia Supreme Court would be
the authoritative state policy --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe we can pursue this,
because I think that's the question exactly that is
bothering me, but I have another example of the same
thing, and I think this is it's for me a very difficult
case.  On the one hand, I absolutely understand the cases,
and I understand why the law -- at least I think I do.
You would be pretty careful about having a group of wine
merchants set their own prices or decide who can sell wine.
And the same is true of a group of railroads and the
same is true of a group of truckers and the same is true
blah, blah, blah, okay, probably including dentists.
And soSo what we have is a set of pretty tough
rules saying the State had better get in there and
supervise or you are subject to the antitrust laws.
That to me is the state of the art.  And that all seems
fine and you seemed -- until I thought of a different
example.  Now, what they are is they are neurologists
and they are brain surgeons, and what the State says is:
We would like this group of brain surgeons to decide who
can practice brain surgery in this State.  I don't want
a group of bureaucrats deciding that.  I would like
brain surgeons to decide that.  Of course the risks are
-- and so we have to have some supervision, I guess.
What?  What kind of supervision?  And why isn't that
present here?  A, any rule has to go to some rule
revision agency.  B, before they can throw anybody out,
they have to go into court and get a court order.  And
C, even these letters would be subject to their state
ABA.
So if I'm on your track, I want to see you
talk about the neurologists and any kind of serious
medical board, and I don't want to suddenly destroy all
the temptation of medical boards throughout the country
to decide everything in favor of letting in the
unqualified person, lest he sue them under the antitrust
law for treble damages and attorneys' fees.  Those are
the things that -- have you followed where I'm coming
from?  And I would very much appreciate your comment.
MR. STEWART:  What is true of the Dental
Board in North Carolina and could also be true of the
neurology or the more general medical board in another
State is, as you say, any regulation that the board
promulgates as a matter of North Carolina law is subject
to review by the Rules Review Commission.  And that's a
body of disinterested State actors who pass on the
validity of the rules, that the standard in the statute
is the Rules Review Commission determines is the
regulation reasonably necessary to implement the
statute, which at least suggests to me that the review
commission is engaged in something like de novo review:
Does this reflect the correct reading of the law.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Really, really?  You are
going to have a review board composed of
non-neurologists deciding de novo whether a particular
person should be admitted or a particular rule should be
adopted?
MR. STEWART:  For rules, and the basis
for --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't want that.  I want
a neurologist to decide it.
MR. STEWART:  If the State wanted a board of
expert practitioners to be able to promulgate rules and
have those rules reviewed deferentially within the State
agency, then the question would arise, is deferential
review sufficient to constitute active supervision?  If
it were de novo, yes.  Patrick v. Burget makes clear
that extremely deferential review, review only for
procedural regularity, is not sufficient.  And the
question, is Chevron-type review enough, that's an open
question.
But the main point I'm making about the
Rules Review Commission is North Carolina evidently
doesn't believe that there is anything amiss with an
agency composed of -- the Rules Review Commission, an
agency composed of nonexperts, reviewing the regulations
promulgated by an expert body for consistency with the
governing statutes.
Now, the question of exclusion of an
individual member, a proceeding to revoke the license of
a particular practitioner, whether or not that would
qualify for State action immunity, it's very unlikely to
have adverse consequences for competition as a whole
and, therefore, would not likely be a subject of
antitrust concern.
I'm sorry, Mr. Justice.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you tell me as
precisely as you can the contours of the rule that you
are advocating?  You told Justice Kagan that election
isn't essential to the analysis here.  So is it
essential that the statute -- that the statute
stipulates that the members must be dentists?  If they
were appointed by the governor, would that take care of
it?  If the governor had to appoint dentists, would that
-- would that involve the same problem?  Is it essential
that they must all be dentists?  What if there is a
breakdown between dentists and nondentists?
Let me just add this.  What if there is no
requirement that they be dentists but the governor
always chooses dentists, because there's a very powerful
dentist lobby; so he is always going to put dentists on
this board exclusively.
MR. STEWART:  I would say two things -- I'd
say three things maybe.  I think, first, we would say
our theory still applies that the self-interest would be
present whether or not they were required to be
dentists.
The second thing we would say is, but that's
a harder case.  In that situation you would at least
need to look beyond the statute books in order to
determine whether the people were dentists and you would
get, at least, a little closer to Omni --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I think that's what troubles
me about your position because it seems to lead to a
case, State by State, board by board, inquiry by the
Federal courts as to whether the members of a regulatory
body are really serving the public interest or whether
they have been captured by some special interest?
MR. STEWART: But I guess the third point I was
going to make is we're not aware of any board like that.
That is, the amicus briefs on both sides say that it is
a frequent practice for States to establish regulatory
boards that are required by law to be composed of
members of the profession being regulated, and the
amicus briefs on the other side says, that's a good and
efficient practice.  The amicus briefs on our side say
that's a problem.  But they all agree that that is a
prevalent practice.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Under that practice, you
said it's not an antitrust violation:  Boycott.  The guy
didn't get into the profession.  He flunked the exam.
The antitrust lawyer says:  I'm out of this profession;
I would offer them competition.  We only have 82
qualified people in this specialty in this State.  Now
there is only 81.  That makes a difference.  Their
questions are unfair, they are against me, and for a
bunch of reasons.
Silver v. New York Stock Exchange.  You
know, it's not hard to make up reasons.  I don't want to
cut you off from Justice Alito, but I would like you to
also, in doing that, to think about what my problem is.
It's the neurologists who are subject to the antitrust
suit.  And the answer seems to lie in the kind of
supervision that you are advocating.
Now, go ahead and go back to Justice Alito,
but I put that in your mind.
MR. STEWART:  I guess the point I was going
to make is, while there is a frequent practice of States
requiring by law that regulatory boards be staffed by
members of the profession, that there appears to be no
instance in which the State left it up to the governor
whom to decide whom to appoint and the governor chose to
appoint only practitioners.  I mean, part of our point
in this case --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Does that mean that is what
is critical in your opinion, that there is a State
statute that says they must be dentists?  If that
weren't there, but the governor always chose dentists
because he wants the dentists' vote and the dentists are
very powerful in that particular State --
MR. STEWART:  We're not prepared to give
that up, but we don't think that that's as strong a
case.  I mean, the fact that they are required to be
dentists signals that they are there in their capacity
as such.
JUSTICE ALITO:  If you are not prepared to
give that up, then I really don't understand the
contours of your rule.  And I find it troubling, because
I really am not attracted to the idea of Federal courts
looking at State agencies, State regulatory entities, to
determine whether they are really serving the public
interest or they are serving some private interest.
MR. STEWART:  We're certainly not advocating
that the Court look to the internal subjective
decision-making processes of the individual members.
That is, if the members were -- if the membership of the
board were people who had no active participation in the
dental profession, who had no economic interest.
The Court in Omni Outdoor certainly made it clear that
the Court is not supposed to be probing whether, in
fact, an individual board member made a decision based
on illicit criteria.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So to the same sort of
question.  Suppose that, you know, we come out with a
ruling that makes clear that an all-dentists board is
not okay and then a State says, okay, we'll do a board
with five dentists and three non-dentists.  How do we
feel about that.
MR. STEWART:  It would still be a
majority or I think the commission used some phrase like
"decisive coalition."  And in this case, in a sense, the
majority treatment of the dentists on the board was
exacerbated.  Only six of nine of the board members are
actually practicing dentists.  But three of the
members --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about ex-dentists?
They're -- they're no longer practicing.  But they're
all dentists and they have a lot of dentist friends.
They're sympathetic to the profession of dentistry.  Are
you going to give them a pass?
MR. STEWART:  I think if the -- if you --
the board were composed of retired dentists, people who
were selected because they had expertise but no current
financial interest, that would be a legitimate way of
staffing.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Thatâ€™s okayOkay.  Okay.  Do
you really think that the financial interest of the
individual members of the board is going to be
significantly affected?  Of each individual member of
the board?  My goodness.  I -- I find that hard to
believe.
MR. STEWART:  I guess to my -- to my
previous answer, I should add if those board members
were selected by a dispassionate State official; that
is, there could also be circumstances in which board
members themselves had no financial interest but were
selected by those who do.  And that might be treated as
a separate --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, going back to
Justice Alito's question, if we have to look at it board
by board, if I were a private practitioner and, in
Justice Breyer's hypothetical, a neurologist came to me
and said, I think it's important for us to do standards,
can I get on this board?  I say, have no part of it.
Triple damages, attorneys' fees.  You can't even afford
to defend this case.  Get off that board.  That's going
to be the consequence of your -- of the rule you
advocate it seems to me.
MR. STEWART:  There's no problem with active
participation by -- but there's no problem with the
board -- boards being staffed by active practitioners so
long as they are adequately supervised.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Does that consist of -- if
you want my off-the-cuff idea, which is probably not
particularly good to give you -- that active -- that
supervision consists of either your board on regulation
or a court which, when reviewing what they do, does so
with an awareness of the State law and the subject and
also the risks of anticompetitive harms.  Ready to set
it aside if, in fact, those risks, which are outside
what the State law wants, seem likely to eventuate.
Now, I could write such a standard pretty
vaguely and that's not necessarily the right standard.
But this whole thing turns to me on what the supervision
consists of and whether it's good enough or not here.
And so that's why I repeat for the -- you know, like the
third time, and I think you -- probably the government
doesn't have a definite position on this or what it
consists of.
MR. STEWART:  I mean, there are different --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Not that you should.  But I
just want to --
MR. STEWART:  I mean, there are -- there are
different things that could qualify as adequate
supervision and, in part, that turns on the nature of
the question to be answered.  That is, the difficult
question that is posed in this case or the -- the
ultimate contested question is:  Is teeth whitening the
practice of dentistry as defined by North Carolina law?
That is a question of statutory interpretation.  The
North Carolina statute speaks of removing stains or
accretions from the human teeth.  There are arguments on
both sides as to whether that encompasses the teeth
whitening methods that are used today.  That's the kind
of dispute that is capable of being definitively
resolved by --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But they'd have to give
deference to the expert board's determination that would
be normal.
MR. STEWART:  They -- they might or might
not --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if it's not, then
you're going to have the neurology qualification
determination made by some people in the State who are
not neurologists.  Now, that to me spells danger.
MR. STEWART:  And the point I was going to
make was the determination of whether a particular
individual is qualified to practice neurology is a
different sort of question from the issue is teeth
whitening the practice of dentistry.  That question is
one of law that a court is capable of deciding.  It
might or might not give deference to the views of a
particular administrative agency.
In our view, it would certainly make sense
not, as a matter of State administrative law, not to
give deference to the view of self-interested
practitioners for the same reasons that -- on that legal
question for the same reasons that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the -- I'm
sorry.  Please.
MR. STEWART:  -- for the same reason that we
think the State action immunity shouldn't apply.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what if one of
the members of the board is appointed as a full-time
member of the board for a one-year term and he's -- he's
called the board state supervisor, is that good enough?
MR. STEWART:  I mean, it depends on what --
first, it would -- we would want to look into the
question does that alleviate his financial interest.
What is his --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  It's only --
it's one year.  But for that one year he's not
practicing dentistry or whatever.  And that way the
supervisor is -- responsive to Justice Breyer's
concern -- the supervisor knows what he's talking about
when it comes to dentistry.
MR. STEWART:  I guess in -- in order even
potentially to qualify as satisfying the active
supervision requirement, the one supervisory member
would have to have the power to countermand the orders
issued by the other members.  If it were simply one and
he were designated a supervisor, but he didn't have the
authority to do --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So he has the
authority.  For that one year, he can veto whatever the
board decides to do.
MR. STEWART:  I'm -- I'm hesitant to take a
position on behalf of the FTC because it would turn on
part -- in part on would the expectation that this
person will return to private practice after a year be
sufficient to maintain his fundamentally private
characteristic.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I mean, the question
that follows is:  What if all of the members of the
board have to refrain from the practice of dentistry
during the year that they serve?  And you're saying you
don't know what the answer will be to that?  What the
FTC will say to that?  I know what the FTC will say to
that.
MR. STEWART:  Well, I guess part of what I
would say in response to these hypotheticals -- and it's
not that they're not legitimate questions.  But this --
this seems to us to be the case at the furthest end of
the spectrum from those.  This is a case in which the
only members of the board who actually participated in
the decision to issue the cease and desist letters were
practicing dentists.  They were people who were required
by law to be practicing dentists.  They were appointed
by other practicing dentists.
The other thing I would say --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Stewart, the problem
with your answer, at least for me, is that you're being
asked for the rule that we're going to announce not just
in this case, but to guide the decision-making for
future courts.  I mean, just to say this board we can do
it the way Judge Keenan did, and say it was an elected
board, but an appointed board is different.  We can say
one of a dozen sort of limitations or not.  So what do
we say?  How do we articulate your ruling?
MR. STEWART:  I mean, the way I read both
Judge Keenan's concurrence and the majority opinion is
both of those said, at least where the members are
selected by other practicing dentists, there is no State
action immunity.  We leave for another day the question
whether the outcome would be different if the members
were selected by the government.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, that's what the
Supreme Court does.  It walks that line and it goes and
looks at the trajectory we're taking.  And some of my
colleagues have expressed the concern that the
trajectory will involve us in case after case trying to
decide how far too far is.
MR. STEWART:  And frankly, if the Court
wanted to say, as part of its opinion, as long as they
are actually required by law to be practicing dentists,
there's no State action immunity, but if the law doesn't
require that and it happens to be the pattern of
gubernatorial appointment, if the Court says that -- the
outcome would, in fact, be different in that case, we
would prefer that to a decision that says we're going to
give these boards a blanket pass because we can foresee
some hard questions at the end of the day.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Look.  Take your -- suppose
I write that down.  Still the problem in the back of my
mind is there are now 311 million Americans who are
going to have medical care.  And this is -- I agree with
you.  This is at one extreme.  But -- but those words
that you just enunciated seem to cover to exactly the
same extent every medical specialty.  And I've
articulated that already that that's my concern.  So I
wonder if you can do something a little bit better
before we say that the doctors cannot be active doctors
and decide on the qualifications of doctors.
MR. STEWART:  I guess the -- the two
things -- the two or three things I would say are first,
I think the decisions about whether particular
individual practitioners will be licensed or have their
license -- license revoked is a fundamentally different
type of determination from the legal question is teeth
whitening or some other generic type of service the
practice of dentistry within particular State law.
The second thing is although, Justice
Sotomayor, you're certainly right that the Court doesn't
announce decisions that are good for one case only and
leave every other question unresolved, the Court also --
the Court also does proceed incrementally and it doesn't
feel disabled from announcing the right rule in the case
before it simply because it can foresee both that
difficult cases will arise in the future and that the
rule it's announcing won't clearly revolve --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have very long
sentences, so it's very hard not to interrupt you.  I --
I don't agree with your first point.  I don't see that
there's an immense difference between establishing
the -- the standards for a profession and excluding an
individual from the profession.  My goodness.  What --
what is a more obvious restriction of competition than
preventing somebody from competing?  I -- I don't see
how you draw that line.  Well, it's one thing to say
that so-and-so can't practice, but it's another thing
to -- to say that tooth whitening is -- is part of the
practice.  It seems to me they both involve
anticompetitive decisions.
MR. STEWART:  They -- they involve
anticompetitive decisions and they involve -- they
require the State to tap into expertise.  That is, the
basic decision to prohibit unlicensed individuals from
removing stains or accretions from teeth was made by the
North Carolina legislature back many decades ago.
Obviously, the North Carolina legislature is not an
expert body, it's not composed of dentists, but
presumably they got input from the dental profession and
they -- they tapped into the relative expertise for
purposes of making their decision.
The determination, once the statutory
structure has been established, the determination
whether teeth whitening falls within one of the
enumerated categories is not really establishing the
standards.  It is interpreting the existing standards.
And that does require some interstitial discretionary
decision-making.  And our point, as -- as Justice Kagan
was alluding to earlier, is we want those interstitial
decisions to be made by disinterested persons or at
least, if they're not made by disinterested persons, we
don't feel confident that they truly reflect the policy
choices of the State legislature itself.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What would happen if the
North Carolina courts were to decide tomorrow that
whitening is the practice of dentistry under this old
statute?
MR. STEWART:  If the North Carolina -- I
mean, to make the case clearest, if the North Carolina
Supreme Court held as an authoritative construction of
State law, I mean, that would basically be the end of
it.  There could still be potential arguments that the
mode of enforcement had anticompetitive consequences
that went beyond the basic prohibition.  But -- but for
all intents and purposes, just as if the North Carolina
legislature had specified that non-dentists cannot
lawfully perform teeth whitening, that policy choice
would not be subject to second-guessing by the FTC or a
Federal antitrust court.
Similarly, if the North Carolina Supreme
Court said, we construe the existing statute to have
that meaning, that determination also wouldn't be
subject to review by an antitrust court.  And
there's been a lot of --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Just to follow up on that.
So was the FTC decision predicated on the proposition
that this was not -- whitening teeth was not within this
old statute?
MR. STEWART:  It was -- the FTC specifically
declined to announce a decision one way or the other;
that is, the complaint counsel in prosecuting the case
before the commission offered reasons to believe that
teeth whitening was not covered by this provision.  And
basically, there were two reasons.  The first is that
scientifically, teeth whitening does not result in the
removal of stains or accretions.  The staining material
remains in the enamel.  It's simply bleached so that the
discoloration is less and it's not so evident.
The second type of evidence that complaint
counsel offered was that, back when the statute was
passed, the methods of removing stains and accretions
that would have been familiar to the legislature
involved scraping, chipping, to some extent electronic
instruments.  It was the type of procedure that could
not safely be done by people who lacked expertise.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you know, last week we
had a case in which the North Carolina Court of Appeals
held that an old motor vehicle statute required only one
brake light rather than two brake lights.  So it doesn't
seem that an interpretation of this statute to cover
whitening would be completely out of the question.
MR. STEWART:  We agree.  And as I say, the
commission specifically declined to announce a decision
one way or the other as to what was the correct reading
of North Carolina law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought they agreed to
the stipulation that this was an articulated State
policy, and the question was must there be in addition
supervision.  But you -- you've conceded for purposes of
this argument the articulated State policy, didn't you?
MR. STEWART:  Well, we conceded -- the
commission assumed arguendo that there was a clearly
articulated State policy.  But if, for instance, rather
than having the dental board composed of dentists, they
were composed of disinterested bureaucrats who would
hear from dentists but would make their own
determination.  The clear articulation requirement would
be satisfied because clear articulation can be satisfied
by something phrased at a relatively high level of
generality.  And so --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the consequences of a
decision in your favor were that no professionals or
representative of any occupation would ever serve on a
government board where there's any chance of antitrust
liability, would that, in your view, advance the
purposes of the antitrust laws?
MR. STEWART:  I mean, if we thought that
were the consequence of the Court's decision, then we
would be very leery of urging this result.  But we see
in cases like Goldfarb that the Virginia bar, for
instance, was held to be susceptible to suit under the
antitrust laws and could not invoke the State action
immunity because it was out ahead of the Virginia
Supreme Court, and that hasn't had the effect of
inducing members of the bar en masse to refrain from bar
association activities.
Just to finish my answer to Justice
Ginsburg, even if the statute is phrased at a relatively
high level of generality that leaves some interstitial
questions unresolved, it can still satisfy clear
articulation.  So if we had a body of disinterested
bureaucrats who said we interpret the phrase "removal of
stains and accretions" to include teeth whitening, we'd
have clear articulation in the statute even though it
didn't resolve every question.  And then we would have a
determination made by a body that would not require
active supervision and that would be good enough.  That
would satisfy the prerequisites to State action immunity
as this Court has articulated.
If I could, I'd like to make two -- two
additional points.  The first is that there was a fair
amount of talk in the first part of the argument about
the oath.  The oath is at North Carolina General Statute
11-7, and basically, the members of the board, like --
like people who are designated State officials
generally, will take an oath to support the
Constitutions of North Carolina and the United States
and to essentially be loyal to the State of North
Carolina.
It's essentially a State law version of the
oath that new members of this Court's bar take in --
take when they're sworn, as was done this morning.  I
believe the members -- I know the members of the bar
swear to support the Constitution of the United States.
I believe that they also swear to faithfully execute
their duties as officers of the Court and members of the
bar of this Court.
But when private counsel take that oath, no
one imagines that they lose their private character, and
in particular, nobody construes that oath as a promise
by private counsel that he will place the interests of
the general public ahead of the interests of his
clients.  Everybody understands that vigorous
representation of a particular constituency may be
consistent with --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's because what they're
promising to do is to serve as faithful private counsel.
If they were being sworn in to an agency and promise to
execute their duties in accordance with law, it would be
quite different.  And that's what's happening here.
MR. STEWART:  There's nothing in the oath
that requires them to place the interests of the public
on a par with the interests of the dental community.
And everything about their selection -- the fact that
they are required to be dentists, the fact that they are
selected by other dentists -- reinforces the sense that
they are expected to treat the dental community as their
constituency.
And the last thing I'd say is a lot of the
debate in areas like this centers on the idea of the
profession regulating itself; neurologists regulating
neurologists, dentists regulating dentists.  A lot of
what the board does is dentists regulation -- regulating
dentists.  But this case is not about that.  This case
is about dentists regulating non-dentists and, in
particular, dentists telling dentists -- telling
non-dentists in what endeavors can you legally compete
with dentists.  And so the concerns that underlie the
Sherman Act with unfair restrictions on competition are
at their zenith in a case like this one.  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Mooppan, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HASHIM M. MOOPPAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. MOOPPAN:  I'd like to begin with Justice
Breyer's question.  The ultimate question in this case
is how to balance a cost-benefit question.
There are benefits from having experts, and
there are risks from having experts be regulators, and
the question is who should make the decision of how to
weigh those costs and balance those risks.  And what the
government is arguing is that the Federal antitrust laws
second-guess the State's decision about how to balance
that risk.
The States have decided that the better way
to handle the situation where you have experts like
neurologists is to have some level of supervision, but
not the level of active supervision that is required for
private parties.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not simply say that the
supervisor, be it the Court or be it the commission,
must, when it decides the lawfulness of the agency's
action or the private board's action, take into account
the risks of self-dealing as well as the State policy
that favors them making this decision, and where the
consequence is an unreasonable weighing, it is unlawful
under State law.
Now, that way you bring in an anti-trust
element, it would comport with Midcal, you would be
guarding against self-dealing without interfering
tremendously with the state.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, for two reasons.  First,
Your Honor, because the states are allowed to act
anti-competitively.  The states don't have to make a
balance between anti-competitive benefits and public
benefits.  The states can unabashedly act competitively
if they wish.
It would also be extremely complicated
because what you would essentially have are two
different versions of active supervision.  One standard
of active supervision that applies to private parties
and one standard of active supervision that applies to
public officials who also have private interests.
That's the reason why Mr. Stewart wouldn't
answer your question by saying any of those things would
work because they will never say that that stuff works
for purely private parties.  They will never say that
just near --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Excuse me.  I'm sorry.
MR. MOOPPAN:  I was just going to say they
would never say that the mere ability to have some level
of review is good enough for private parties because
even they recognize there is a fundamental difference
between a private party and a public official who also
has private interests.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Mooppan, the active
supervision requirement has been around a long time and
it varies case by case and state by state.  There are a
wide, wide, wide variety of mechanisms that might
satisfy the active supervision prong in a particular
state with respect to a particular kind of activity.
But what you are suggesting is that that
prong be simply removed from the analysis, that it be
utterly irrelevant, that there is no supervision at all,
and that's a very different and much more dramatic
thing.
MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, what I'm suggesting is
twofold.  First, the act of supervision is a fairly
rigorous standard and I am sure the FTC would have told
you that if you had asked them that question precisely.
And I'm saying that it -- the issue here isn't whether
these people will be unsupervised.  The question is who
will determine what level of supervision.  And the
question is whether the state should decide that a lower
level of supervision is the appropriate one, balancing
expertise versus the risk of conflicts of interests.
And especially when you're dealing with supervision of
market participants.  There is a grave risk that if you
require too much supervision as a condition of
anti-trust immunity, no one will serve on these boards.
Mr. Stewart said he would be leery of
advocating this position if we would have a high
deterrence effect.  Well, there is an amicus brief from
the ADA and the AMA and from 23 states, all of whom
express grave concern that if you require supervision
market participants will not serve on these boards, and
that is the sort of concern this Court has recognized in
cases like Hoover v. Romlin.
It is fundamentally up to the state to
determine how to bear this risk.  Whether they want to
say that the benefits of expertise outweigh the risks of
conflicts of interest.  That is what this Court held in
cases like Omni, that the Sherman Act is not intended to
serve as some general rule of good government.  It is up
to the state to determine how they want to regulate as
sovereigns.
The final point I would like to make is
about Justice Alito's question about what would happen
if the State Supreme Court tomorrow said that teeth
whitening was the practice of dentistry.  I'm not quite
sure I understood Mr. Stewart's position but the holding
below is that active supervision is required regardless
of whether there is clear articulation, so I would think
that there would be liability regardless of what
the Court did in the future.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
