CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument next in Case 12-5196, Law v. Alfred H. Siegel,
Chapter 7 Trustee.
Mr. Hellman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW S. HELLMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HELLMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Congress expressly prohibited what the
bankruptcy court did here.  Under Section 522(k) of the
Code, Congress specified that a debtor's exempt
property, his homestead, his pension, his wedding ring,
is not liable for the payment of, quote, "any
administrative expense."
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Will you crank
up your -- your thing?  I can't you hear well enough.
That's good.
MR. HELLMAN:  Congress, in Section 522(k),
specified specifically that a debtor's exempt property
is not liable for any administrative expense.
The bankruptcy court was not free to
override that express and specific prohibition in the
name of equity, a point that has been clear for at least
80 years, since this Court's case in Ginsberg & Sons,
and said Congress made the judgment that debtors and
their dependents, even dishonest debtors, ought not be
deprived of their exempt property such that they would
emerge from bankruptcy as wards of the State.
Instead, Congress authorized other serious
punishments for debtor misconduct.  But arguments for
punishment that the Code forbids must be addressed to
Congress and not the supposed equitable discretion of
the bankruptcy court.
Now, if I could, I'd like to --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I am somewhat taken aback by
your constant reference -- your repeated references to
"wards of the State."
What we're talking about is whether your
client gets $75,000.  Do you think everybody who doesn't
have $75,000 is a ward of the State?
MR. HELLMAN:  This is his last $75,000, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  Well, do you -- do you
know what the -- the median net worth of a household in
the United States is?
MR. HELLMAN:  It's -- it's about -- I'm not
sure what the median net worth --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It's less than $70,000.  So
the question here is not whether he's going to be a ward
of the State.  The question is whether he's going to be
above the median in his assets.
MR. HELLMAN:  Well, I think what's going on
here, Your Honor, is actually a federalism principle.
Congress recognized, in 522, that States, in effect,
would be the ones who would have to take care of those
who do not have a home, do not have tools of trade, do
not have a pension.
And so what 522 does is it says that the
State authorizes you an exemption, and you claim it, and
it becomes exempt, then you get to keep it through the
bankruptcy law, because otherwise, in effect, it is the
State that ends up being required to house or support
or -- or help those and their dependents who are
deprived of, essentially, their last dollar, which is
what is exactly the case here.
Here every penny -- all of Mr. Law's
creditors in this case have been paid off.  The trustee
has already received approximately $280,000.  We're just
talking about literally, literally, the last $75,000,
and all of it, that would be going to the trustee.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't follow that,
because I thought that $75,000 would go to satisfy part
of the claim, that there would still be the legal fees
unpaid.
MR. HELLMAN:  All his creditors -- the debts
that existed beforehand --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  But now the -- the
trustee, who is obliged to try to find what assets he or
she can, spends a huge amount of money in order to -- to
prove that this claim of a second mortgage was false.
And -- and there should be -- so what
happens then, on your theory, that all that money was
spent and the result is that the second mortgage is
canceled; the creditors are satisfied?  Nobody pays the
legal expenses.  Is that --
MR. HELLMAN:  Well, the first 280,000 have
been satisfied, and the trustee was not obligated by any
law to pursue the administration of the estate in a way
that would be cost-ineffective.
But our point here is that Congress had made
the determination -- we could have -- there could be a
policy discussion, of course, about whether exempt
property ought to be allowed to go to the administrative
costs of the estate or to prepetition creditors in
situations in which the -- a court finds litigation
misconduct.
But that is not the judgment Congress made.
JUSTICE ALITO:  What was -- what was the
trustee supposed to do?  Suppose the trustee has a meter
running on -- on his desk, and he's hot in pursuit of
this phantom Lily Lin of China, but we get -- we get to
the point where he's down to the -- he says, well, if I
do any more work, the only way I'm going to get paid is
out of the $75,000.  I better stop because, otherwise,
I'm going to be working free.
What should he do?
MR. HELLMAN:  Well, the trustee, in that
situation -- and the trustee handbook, pages 4-3, 4-4 of
the trustee handbook that the United States Office of
Trustee puts out, notes that administrators on the
estate ought to assess whether or not pursuing a claim
will be an effective -- will yield an effective return
for the estate.
And, again, Congress, made the judgment
that, when a debtor lies to a court, he loses his
discharge.  And that has an effect on the debtor's
obligations going forward.  It means that the debtor's
prepetition debts, to the extent they're unsatisfied,
stay with him for the rest of his life.
But Congress did not say the denial of
discharge allows the trustee to recover anything more
than it otherwise would.
So, again, I think the question is one of
policy, and one the policy where Congress has spoken
clearly.  The text of --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can we talk about that
policy?
MR. HELLMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, it would seem to
me that a court's sanctioning power is among one of the
most respected and longstanding powers.  So putting
aside the government's reliance on the statutory scheme,
I don't see it.  But how about the inherent power?
MR. HELLMAN:  Well, inherent power --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Meaning, you want to
read a preclusion of the inherent power out of -- not
from an express term, but implicitly.
MR. HELLMAN:  No, Your Honor.  Just -- I
should note, of course, inherent power was never argued
below, nor presented in the bio.  But I think the more
important response to your question is the following:
We are not talking in this case about the inherent power
to sanction a litigant.
This -- we don't dispute that Rule 11 exists
and other punishments exist under the Code.
This case is about a court saying the
property from which that -- that sanction can be
satisfied, out of what property can that sanction be
paid or forced to be paid.  And there --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you are talking
about the inherent power.  You're saying a court, in
its --
MR. HELLMAN:  Not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- inherent power, can't
use that property.  That's what you're saying.
MR. HELLMAN:  My point is that there is no
longstanding tradition of the same vein of a court being
able to sanction, to be able to say, you owe attorneys'
fees for this bad conduct.  That's not what this case is
about.  This case is about the property out of which
that sanction can be paid.
And Congress spoke specifically.  And when
Congress speaks specifically, this Court recognized in
NASCO, in Nova Scotia, and in a long line of cases
beforehand, in the Article III context no less, in the
Article III court, this Court recognized that where
Congress speaks expressly, a court does not have the
inherent power or otherwise to reach the contrary
result.
And I think the Ginsberg case is quite on
point here because the facts of that case were striking
even today.
There, in Ginsberg, the debtor was a
corporation, and an officer of that corporation was
seeking to flee the jurisdiction with corporate cash,
funds of the corporation.  A creditor went to the
bankruptcy court and said, we need to detain this
person, arrest him.  He's fleeing with property of the
estate.
This Court said the arrest writ was not
valid.  Why?  Because the Bankruptcy Code specified the
situations in which arrest was authorized.
Conditions A, B, and C needed to be
satisfied.  This was situation D, and the creditor
adverted to the general equitable powers of the
bankruptcy court, which are codified then, as now, in
a provision.  And this Court said, no, the specific
provision that's at stake here, at issue here, means
that the equitable provision, the general equity cannot
overcome that.
And in fact, Ginsberg was a less clear case
than this one.  The arrest provision in Ginsberg was
framed affirmatively.  You may arrest if situations A, B
and C are here.  And the Court said you can't add
situation D to that.
This is a case not by implication, but an
express prohibition:  Exempt property is not liable for
the payment of any administrative expense, save in two
situations.  It wasn't even as if Congress --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your position is that the
trustee can take no action to make the estate whole in
the event of, say, Justice Alito's type of hypothetical,
the bank -- the estate bankruptcy trustee spends
$125,000 in legal fees to bring property back to the
estate that had been concealed by wrongful conduct of
the debtor and the debtor still gets $75,000 of that?
There’s nothing the bankruptcy trustee can do to make
that bankruptcy estate whole?
MR. HELLMAN:  Of course, as was the case
here, there was a denial of discharge, the classic and
serious penalty for debtors who engage in misconduct
before a bankruptcy court. Now what that means in almost
every case is that there will be debts owed to
pre-petition creditors that remain unpaid.
It's essentially the bankruptcy death
penalty in the sense that it makes the debtor liable for
the rest of his days until those debts are paid off.
That's a very serious punishment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is It? Now what about the house?  The
house was still exempt because if they levy on the
house, you go back to bankruptcy and it's still exempt.
So there's nothing you can do to make the trustee -- the
estate whole.
MR. HELLMAN:  Two points, Your Honor.  One,
the question to where you want to draw the line about
deterring debtor misconduct and leaving debtors without,
literally, their last dollar coming out of bankruptcy is
an important question, but a policy question, and one
where Congress has spoken with an expressed prohibition.
Now, there are other sanctions, not -- none
of which were levied here or sought to be levied here,
Rule 11 and the like, that might serve to provide an
additional source of funds, but not from exempt
property, because Congress has walled that off.  If one
looks --
JUSTICE BREYER:  The same thing is true of
certain retirement funds.
MR. HELLMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So if, in fact, the person
has $4 million in this special retirement fund account
and he's behaved in the most extraordinarily dishonest
way, the trustee has no power to impose a sanction on
those funds, even if he'll earn a big income, he's lied
nonstop, etcetera.
MR. HELLMAN:  Congress has amended
Section 522 already eight times since 1978, about once
every 4-1/2 years, if my math is correct, to fine-tune
the extent to which debtors can claim exemptions.  As
the Court is aware, in 2005 for example, the -- Congress
limited the extent to which a debtor could claim an
exemption in his homestead, I suppose precisely for
analogous reasoning to what Your Honor suggests.
It's still nonetheless perfectly clear from
Section 522(k) that Congress has not created or allowed
some sort of free-floating equitable discretion for
bankruptcy courts to reach a different result in cases.
And again I would like to point the Court to Section
522(c) as well, which is the companion provision to the
administrative expenses provision.
As the Court, of course, is aware, debtors
often have debts arising from all sorts of improper
conduct, willful and malicious injury, criminal
restitution awards, fraud, embezzlement, there is a
whole list of these things in Section 523 and the Code
makes these debts non-dischargeable, inherent per se
non-dischargeable, meaning that when you go through
bankruptcy you’re not going to be able to escape paying
these debts once the bankruptcy is over.
However, in Section 522(c)(1) of the code
Congress picked out just two, just two of those
categories of debts, alimony and certain tax liability,
of these non-dischargeable debts that could be satisfied
from exempt property.
The debtor who has a wrongful death
judgment, the debtor who has a fraud judgment, the
debtor who has a criminal restitution award, all of
those debts are non-dischargeable, they stay with the
debtor until they're paid, but they are expressly not
paid from exempt property.
That is a quintessential policy judgment of
Congress's to decide where to draw the line between
deterring, not making bankruptcy a haven for those who
seek to avoid their misconduct or engage in misconduct,
but at the same time recognizing that taking someone's
homestead -- taking someone's homestead in effect, with
respect, does leave them without a home, and
essentially --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When he takes that
$75,000 and assuming he doesn't pay debts with it and he
invests it, what happens to the income on that
investment?  Is that exempt, too, from paying off his
creditors?
MR. HELLMAN:  It's actually even less
friendly to the debtor than that, Your Honor.  Under
California law -- and Federal law takes State law
exemptions as it finds it absent a contrary Federal
provision -- the debtor if he ever were to receive the
$75,000, by law, California law, would have 6 months to
reinvest it in a homestead.  That's what California is
doing.  It's saying, we are going to give you the
opportunity to reinvest and have a home.
If it's not reinvested, it's not exempt, at
least not for purposes of the Federal scheme going
forward.  If it doesn't retain its exempt character,
then if he puts it in a bank account, that's not exempt;
the interest and principal, both of those are available
to satisfy any creditor who might -- who might be out
there to whom he owes funds.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's California, but
that's not necessarily every other State.
MR. HELLMAN:  Those States that give a
homestead exception, and that's 48 of 50, all, with the
exception of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which use the
Federal homestead exemption, all of those -- the vast
majority of those States have a reinvestment principle.
I know Illinois does, I know that several
other States do as well, for just the reason Your Honor
suggests.  This money is not put away in a box such that
it can't be touched again.  The homestead exemption
represents an opportunity for the debtor to have a home.
That's what California law protects and California in
its judgment decided to award.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you saying that he
must spend the $75,000 on a new residence within how
many -- what period of time?
MR. HELLMAN:  6 months, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  6 months.  And if at the
end of 6 months he can't find a home at that price, then
what happens?
MR. HELLMAN:  California law says it needs
to be reinvested within 6 months in a homestead.
Otherwise it loses its exempt character.  I'm not sure
if there is any sort of waiver law that could be -- my
understanding is 6 months is the time that he has.  And
that's California's decision.
The Federal law doesn't have a contrary
provision that would --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then if 6 months runs,
and he hasn't purchased a new home, then the $75,000
goes where?
MR. HELLMAN:  It is available to his
creditors.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They have been paid
already.
MR. HELLMAN:  That's right.  And the way
bankruptcy -- Congress has chosen to make the Bankruptcy
Code work is that absent any sort of special award
when -- when Congress has made the determination that a
debtor is not liable for his administrative expenses
once the bankruptcy case closes, even if there has been
a denial of discharge.
Congress has determined that, although a
debtor will be on the hook for the debts that he brought
into bankruptcy, he will not be on the hook for debts
arising from the administrative expenses going forward,
because I think Congress understood that those expenses
might be out of the debtor's control and that a debtor
ought not leave bankruptcy in a worse condition --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So then what you said
before needs to be modified.  He does get to keep the
$75,000 because there is no creditors to be paid off
from.
MR. HELLMAN:  The $75,000 is not protected
from any creditor who might have a claim to it.  That's
all I meant to suggest, Your Honor.  In this case his
creditors have in fact been paid off and there is no
sanctions award or other award that would --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When you say, "paid off,"
do you mean paid off 100 percent?
MR. HELLMAN:  The -- his primary creditor
was a judgment creditor who had a debt of $160,000;
negotiated it down to $120,000 in exchange for being
paid first.  And I do mean 100 percent, yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what you started
with, oh, this is a terrible sanction, he's denied a
discharge and all that, that doesn't mean a thing to
him, does it?  Because everybody's paid off.  He doesn't
have any debts.
MR. HELLMAN:  This debtor does not have any
remaining debts.  Most debtors, however, because of the
way the priority scheme works in bankruptcy, will be
paying their administrative expenses first and have
their debtor--bligations come second.  And, of course, if there
is a non-dischargeable debt, as I said, then even
without a finding of non-dischargeability, those stay
going forward.
And I want to emphasize again that we are
not talking here -- my friends on the other side suggest
that this is sort of from a deep tradition of the
inherent power of a court to sanction.  This is not
about that power.  This is about the property from which
a sanction award can be paid.  There is no tradition
supporting that award.
And, of course, as this Court said in
Owen v. Owen, where the code is clear -- and I don't
think, with respect, it could be much clearer than
saying not liable for any administrative expense, save
in two situations not present here -- that is the
code -- that is the language that controls.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I should know this,
but who's going to get stuck with the extra couple
hundred thousand dollars?  Is that the trustee in an
individual capacity or someone else?
MR. HELLMAN:  It's really the trustee's law
firm, which is an arm of the trustee.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They don't recoup
that from anywhere else, right?  They are on the hook
for that?
MR. HELLMAN:  That is correct, Your Honor.
That is correct.
Now, the primary authority --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do they get a thank-you
letter from the --
(Laughter.)
MR. HELLMAN:  The primary authority that my
friends on the other side used to support their reading
of the statute is the Marrama case.  And I want to
emphasize, that case does not support the proposition
that bankruptcy courts can violate specific provisions
of the code if they believe equity warrants another
result.
In Marrama, the court was -- the Marrama
majority was clear to note that no provision of the code
expressly forbid the result that the court was going to
allow, and that 105 -- Section 105 in that case was
being used to accomplish something the code permits and
to do it promptly rather than in a delayed fashion.
This case is not about prompt versus
delayed.  This is about doing what the code expressly
forbids.  This case is not about what Section 105
allows.  This case is about what section 522 expressly
forbids.
And, here, Congress has made the judgment,
considering all the different  deterrent mechanisms and policy
interests at play, Congress has made the judgment that
administrative expenses are not liable for any
administrative -- exempt property is not liable for any
administrative expense.
JUSTICE ALITO:  In the Malley case, Justice
Souter said that if this is not what Section 105(a) was
intended for, it's hard to see what Section 501(a) was
intended for.  I take it you just think he's flatly
wrong.
MR. HELLMAN:  We do disagree, Your Honor.
The equities in that case, I suppose, are sharper in the
sense that the debtor is leaving bankruptcy with more
money than he otherwise would be able to have.  But it
is just as clear in that case that Congress has not made
the exception that -- it's more than -- this is not a
negative implication case.
I want to stress that.  It's not just that
Congress hasn't put this on the list of things that
can't be done.  Congress has a flat-out prohibition the
structure is not liable for any administrative expense
or any prepetition debt, save in the enumerated
circumstances.
So, yes, with respect, I do think Malley was
wrongly decided, and this Court need do nothing more
than reaffirm what it has done for 80 years, which is to
say that 105 gives bankruptcy courts the power to act.
Our position is quite modest.  We're only saying they
can't do what the code forbids.
Whether the code is -- whether they're
acting interstitially or they're acting to carry out
express provisions of the code, of course that's what
105 does.
The scholars brief that is submitted on our
side on pages 21 to 26 lists a bevy of practices that
will -- that should and will continue unabated because
they -- under Section 105 by bankruptcy courts to carry
out the administration of justice, because there are
things that the code does not expressly forbid.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Hellman, (k) of
course talks about exempt property.
MR. HELLMAN:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is there a possibility of
reading the statute such that the exemption just never
comes into effect?  If you look at 522(l) --
MR. HELLMAN:  Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- (l) says, "unless a party
in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt is
exempt."  Now, that suggests that if the party in
interest does object, there's a question about whether
the party claimed as exempt is exempt.
So -- so why isn't it a permissible reading
of the statute to essentially say the court gets to
decide whether this is exempt property such that (k)
comes into effect, and in deciding whether it's exempt
property, it can take into account the Petitioner's
abuse of process?
MR. HELLMAN:  Two points.  Of course, no
objection was ever lodged within the time period that
rule --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  I completely agree
with that, but suppose one were.
MR. HELLMAN:  That objection -- that
objection would not be well founded because it is
undisputed that Petitioner is entitled to his homestead
exemption under California law.  California law says
this is his home, he's lived there for the requisite
amount of time, he has the equity, all of that.
Congress later, in provisions that wouldn't
apply to this case either, put some limits on a debtor's
ability -- Federal limits on a debtor's ability to claim
his homestead exemption; if money is poured into the
home before declaring bankruptcy, Congress cut back on
that a little bit.  And I suppose you could have an
objection on that basis.
But this was not a case in which the
Petitioner lost his exemption because he wasn't entitled
to it.  To the contrary, at page 69a of the appendix,
the court observes this is the exemption to which he's
otherwise entitled, but it's his -- the court found that
his litigation misconduct warranted taking away what he
was otherwise entitled to under Section 522(l) and
protected by (k) and (c).
JUSTICE ALITO:  So you're saying a creditor
could not have objected when your client claimed the
exemption on the ground that the exemption is going to
prevent the discovery -- the disclosure of the
fraudulent nature of this mortgage.
The creditor could not have objected to the
exemption on that basis?
MR. HELLMAN:  The objection was proper.  So
the answer to your question is yes, no objection -- no
objection would have been proper in that situation
because --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And why is that?
MR. HELLMAN:  Because Section 522, the way
it works is that the question is are you entitled to the
exemption under State law.  That's what Section 522(b),
I believe, asks you to look at.  And then there's a
question of is an objection going to be interposed
within the period provided by Section 522(l).
Congress, of course, is free to create other
limitations on a debtor's ability to claim exemptions.
And as I said, they have done that in Section 522(o),
Section 522(p), Section 522(q), which deals
specifically, by the way, with situations in which the
very filing of the bankruptcy case is a -- is an abuse
of the code.
And in that case, in Section 522(q),
Congress ultimately decided that for debtors whose
fraud -- and is convicted of a felony whose filing of
the case shows that it's an abuse of the code, Congress
decided in those cases that a debtor should not lose all
of his exempt property.
They put a cap in at $155,000, which, as
Your Honor points out, is quite generous, quite generous
given the median income of -- of the American family;
and further stated that exemption could be tilted upward
where necessary to support the debtor and his
dependents.  Not downward, no discretion to go downward,
but can go upward, if necessary, in the bankruptcy
court's view to support the debtor -- reasonably
necessary to support the debtor and his dependents.
So Congress -- so your question was could
there have been an objection?  The answer is no.  And I
would just say in passing that Congress has decided and
has amended the statute several times to fine tune
exactly when it is -- there ought to be or could be an
objection to property validly claimed as exempt under
State law.
This is not one of those cases; far from it.
And, again, I want to stress, this is not an argument
from negative implication.  This is not an argument from
interstices.  This is an argument from express and
categorical prohibition.
And if there are no further questions, I'll
reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MR. HELLMAN:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Katyal.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The facts explain why the bankruptcy court
exercised its discretion appropriately under both
Section 105(a) and the longstanding inherent power of
the court.  Mr. Law committed a massive fraud on that
court with the fake Lily Lee mortgage and fake documents.
Petitioner lied repeatedly to the court, and then lied
about his lies, all in an attempt to retain nonexempt
property and equity in his home in contravention of the
code.
Section 105(a) was made for a case like
this.  It provides ample authority for what the
bankruptcy court did, both in its first sentence, which
uses a sweeping formulation of any order necessary or
appropriate and as well as its second sentence which
gives bankruptcy courts, quote, "the broad authority to
take any action that is necessary or appropriate to
prevent an abuse of process."
That is the language Marrama used to
describe the second sentence, and it fits here
perfectly.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My problem is -- my
problem is that I read the sentence and it lops off its
beginning.  What the beginning says is "No provision of
this title providing for the raising of an issue by a
party of interest can stop a court from doing that."  An
abusing process, presumably.
So how could a party legitimately, whether
the trustee or anyone else, make any claims to the
exempt property?
MR. KATYAL:  Justice Soto- --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How can the Court do
something neither the Bankruptcy Code nor any of its
provisions permit the trustee to do?
MR. KATYAL:  Justice Sotomayor, for
precisely the reasons that both Marrama and Justice
Souter in the Malley case suggested, which is at the
second sentence fortifies --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's your strongest
argument, that Justice Souter --
MR. KATYAL:  Well, it's at the second
sentence fortifies the first; that is, the way to
understand the second -- the power of the court and the
orders that are necessarily appropriate.  One such power
is to remedy fraud upon the court, the abuse of process.
That's what Congress used.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My problem is that the
code itself doesn't do that.  It limits the access to
the exemption to specified frauds, to frauds that result
in a conviction.  To amounts, it doesn't permit the
exemption -- it -- it does away with the exemptions for
an amount above 155.
So if the code doesn't permit full recovery
for fraud, why should a court be permitted to do it?
MR. KATYAL:  Well, of course, that provision
wasn't in effect at the time.  That's 522(q) which you
are referring to.  But we think 522(q) doesn't -- isn't
violated here.  Absolutely, you're right, Justice
Sotomayor, if there were a violation of 522(q), 105(a)
couldn't take that back.
But the language of 522(q), which is found
in the blue brief at page 19a of the appendix, just says
that if there is a circumstance of a felony -- it
doesn't even mention fraud -- but if there is a felony
that occurs and -- in the filing of the petition, then
it says that -- that you can't get more than -- you
shall not exceed $156,000.
It says nothing about the longstanding power
of the court to depart downward and to give up to zero.
It's just like a punitive damages cap.  So Florida's
punitive damages law says that if you have -- if you're
the victim of medical malpractice or something, you can
get up to $500,000.  You shall -- your award shall not
exceed $500,000.
But of course, that doesn't take back the
power of the factfinder to say you shall get nothing in
a particular case.  And this is a perfect illustration
of a case in which a debtor should get nothing.
Mr. Law tried to invoke the protections of
the code while he repeatedly defied the obligations
under the code at every turn.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would you ask -- would
you answer Justice Breyer's question?  Does this power
go to invading the other exempt properties, like an IRS?
I'm assuming there are now invasion provisions for an
IRS, but would this power permit the court to invade
an -- not an IRS --
JUSTICE BREYER:  An IRA.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Thank you.  An IRA.
MR. KATYAL:  Our argument here is just
limited to this type of case in which you're lying about
the underlying asset itself and trying to seek an
exemption.  I know the Solicitor General advances a
broader argument, and I suppose that the Court can deal
with that in an appropriate case.
But here, Mr. Law undervalued his home and
put all of these fake mortgages on, and then repeatedly
submitted perjured documents to the court about the very
exemption.  And as Justices -- Justices Ginsburg and
Alito said before, what's a Trustee to do in that
situation except investigate?  That's his duty under
Section 704, to try and figure out what has happened.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, he doesn’t have to
investigate to the tune of half a million dollars
chasing a much smaller amount that is at issue.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think,
Mr. Chief Justice, that's the wrong way to look at it,
with all respect.  For one thing, of course, the -- the
trustee's actions allowed title to be cleared and the
underlying house to be sold for $680,000, paying off all
the creditors.
If Mr. Law's representations were
accepted -- and this is something the Bankruptcy Court
found at page 77 -- the trustee would have had to
abandon the property altogether.  That's $680,000 that
nobody would have gotten.  So that's the first thing.
And the second thing is, of course, that
when the trustee started his investigation and realized
there was a fake mortgage, he would have never thought
that this would have become, as you said, a
half-million-dollar case.  He would have thought, well,
look, these documents prove this is a fraud.
But what Mr. Law did in response was to take
19 separate appeals to -- you know, 14 to the bankruptcy
appellate court, five to the Ninth Circuit.  I mean --
you know, I looked at --
JUSTICE BREYER:  He behaved very badly, and
in view of this, I agree with that.  Why wouldn't -- or
why didn't the -- or why couldn't the trustee simply
sanction?  I mean, you have apparently the authority
here in 105 to sanction conduct abusive of the judicial
process.
That includes an order directing payment of
expenses.  Okay.  I guess this is an expense.  And that
wouldn't be discharged, because it's a postpetition
debt.
So why not just do that?  And even if he
doesn't have money now, if he ever gets any he's going
to have to pay it.  So it looks as if there's an
alternative way of  paying for this.
MR. KATYAL:  So two responses.  First of
all, as to the existence of an alternative sanction, I
think this Court in Chambers was very clear in saying
that doesn't displace other powers of the court.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it doesn't.  But why,
when you have pretty clear language saying this shall
not be used for administrative expense --
MR. KATYAL:  Because for --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and you have general
language over here saying a general power to sanction,
and you have an alternative way that's perhaps almost as
good, why read the language that says no to say, well,
yes?
MR. KATYAL:  I want to respond to why there
isn't an expressed prohibition in a minute.  But just
taking your point before, the reason is the facts of
this case.  That is, the sanction would only be paid out
of postpetition debt.
And I think there's a pretty good reason why
my friend's brief on the other side is willing to
entertain sanctions and the like, because he would
engage in the same type of conduct that he has now,
repeatedly stymying the court in the ability to try and
get that $75,000 sanction, should it ever be imposed.
And so that -- so sanctions come from
postpetition assets.  And that's I think one of the
problems.
Now, with respect to the bigger question, is
there a prohibition somewhere in the code?  We don't
think there is.  We don't think 522(k) says anything
like what my friend said in his opening sentence, that
this is somehow an express prohibition.  We think that
the language of 522(k) has to be read against three
different things, the first, Section 105(a) and its
sweeping language; second, something you never heard a
word about in my friend's argument on the other side,
which is the longstanding presumption that the
protections of the Bankruptcy Code are meant for the
honest but unfortunate debtor; and third, language in
522 which Justice Kagan alluded to which suggests that
someone is not entitled to the right of an exemption,
and the court can take it -- the court can refuse to
provide it in the first place.
JUSTICE BREYER:  If he has the exemption,
(k) says:  "Property that the debtor exempts under this
section is not liable for payment of any administrative
expense."  That's why I thought it seemed a fairly
definite no, unless you read the general knowledge and
tradition to mean yes.
MR. KATYAL:  I think you have to read the
language of 522(k), which was enacted in 1978, against
the fact that Section 105(a) was on the books and indeed
enhanced in 1978.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think that's a little bit
backwards, right?  Doesn't 105 exist to the extent that
there's no prohibition saying otherwise?  And then
522(k) comes in, and there's your prohibition.
MR. KATYAL:  No, because I think in order to
understand what the prohibition was, you have to -- you
have to look to 105(a); that is, what 105(a) does is it
says, in general, you have this power.  And indeed,
522(k), I think it speaks of the general case in which
there isn't this type of excessive bad faith, fraud on
the court.
And so absolutely, I think in general, just
as in Marrama itself, there's general language which
says administrative expenses normally aren't liable.
But in the atypical case, to use Marrama's words, a case
like this in which the only way the code would work and
functionally work is to incentivize trustees to try and
uncover the fraud.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So but then you're saying
essentially that every provision in the Bankruptcy Code
ought to be read with an addendum that says, "Except if
there's an abuse of process."
MR. KATYAL:  Your Honor, I think that's what
generally both the Hunt prohibition and indeed the first
line of Marrama says, which is that the basic idea of
the Bankruptcy Code is to provide honest but unfortunate
debtors a system of relief.  And it misses the forest
for the trees to essentially look with tunnel vision
just at (k).  (K) exists within a larger framework of
background duties and obligations that a debtor must
comply with.
A debtor can't come in and say, oh, I've
just met 522.  It presupposes they've already met, for
example, 5 -- Section 521, which is a truthful
disclosure of assets and liabilities.
And if you adopt Mr. Law's formulation,
you're essentially saying that the main architect -- the
main safeguard against this type of abuse, the trustee,
is left holding the bag at the end of the day.  The
trustee is the only one here who acted, I think,
appropriately, trying to uncover all of this, and he
would be stuck with hundreds of thousands of dollars in
attorneys' fees.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But couldn't the --
couldn't the bankruptcy judge just deny him, deny him
bankruptcy?
MR. KATYAL:  Yes, he can deny him
bankruptcy, but that doesn't solve the underlying
problem that Mr. Law would still have $75,000 in assets
that he is trying to seek under his exemption and the
trustee has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
trying to unravel that scheme.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you limit in a
principled way -- you say where you differ with the
Solicitor General is that if an -- if an IRA had existed
here, they would say that could be used.  And you're
saying, I don't need to go that far.  That's on the
facts.  But on what theory would you limit recovery in
those situations?
MR. KATYAL:  Well, we're not advocating for
a limit, but I suppose if one -- if the Court wanted to
find one, they'd find it in Chambers itself, which said
that the inherent power of the court is something that
could be exercised sparingly and only in extreme cases.
And if -- if there is a situation in
which -- you know, if some sort of forfeiture was a
massive amount compared to the underlying fraud on the
court, that wouldn't be appropriate.
That would be reviewed under abuse of
discretion.  All we’re suggesting here --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's hard to enforce.
Every lawyer's case is an exceptional case.  That's just
the way it works.
MR. KATYAL:  Well, but I think that's a
problem that -- with Chambers itself, Justice Kennedy,
and I think the courts have figured out ways to deal
with that problem, by saying it's only reserved for the
exceptional case and this is really truly that case.
This  isn’t just fraud on the Court, it's
fraud on the Court squared.  They're lying about the
lies themselves.  And the bankruptcy court can't work,
it can't function if you don't have the trustee
incentivized to under -- to undertake the kind of
investigation that occurred here.
My friend talks about denial of discharge or
criminal penalties being ways to try and deal with this,
but all of those sanctions depend on the action of the
trustee to uncover the fraud in the first place.
And when you have someone like Mr. Law,
who's a serial liar to the Court, this isn't just bad
faith, Justice Kennedy.  This isn't just -- you know,
one document that is wrong by 5 or $10, this is repeated
perjury to the Court.  And that is the quintessential
thing Section 105 is about when it talks about abuse of
process.
If you don't permit equitable forfeiture
here, you are essentially giving effect to Mr. Law's
abuse of process.  With respect to the underlying --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It made me think of a --
think of a bankruptcy petitioner who, in part, has a
debt arising towards a creditor that consisted of the
most frightful conduct you can think of.  I mean,
something really awful that he did to somebody.  And yet
that debtor can be excused, bankrupt, and keeps the
$75,000.
Now, while lying to a bankruptcy trustee is
bad, it's not hard for us to think of conduct that's far
worse.  And yet, he can keep the $75,000.  Why should --
why should this particular form of bad conduct allow the
invasion of the homestead?
MR. KATYAL:  For two reasons,
Justice Breyer, because Section 105(a), as well as the
inherent power of the Court deal with specifically this
type of situation, abuse of process, fraud on the Court
itself, not any type of prepetition conduct or anything
like that.  It's targeted to this.  And, of course, the
language in 522(q), which we were talking about earlier,
is only about that prepetition conduct.
It doesn't have -- so absolutely.  Congress
is free, if they want, to abrogate 105(a) or the
inherent power of the Court and to say, look, if you've
engaged in bad faith, fraud on the Court, whatever,
you're still entitled to your exemption.  That's not
what it says.
To the contrary, and this picks up on
Justice Kagan's point earlier, 522(l) and (v) provide a
mechanism to reject an exemption that is being sought.
And here, that happened.  522(l) says -- and this is
laid out at our brief at pages 38 and 39 -- if someone
raises an objection to an exemption that a debtor is
seeking, that exemption can be denied.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the objection
had to be raised by a creditor within a certain time.
MR. KATYAL:  It doesn't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought -- isn't there
a provision that says, and if there's no objection, the
exemption is what is claimed?
MR. KATYAL:  522(l) doesn't say that.  It
refers to a party in interest, which could be a trustee
as well.  And so here, we think both the trustee
objected in filing the motion for -- in 2006 as well as
the Court itself.  Section 105 has to be read alongside
522, and it provides the Court the sua sponte power to
do so.
There is a time limit, Justice Ginsburg, in
Rule 403, but that time limit can itself be extended if,
under the terms of the rule, if there's been a
subsequent amendment of the underlying schedule.  And
here we think effectively, there was a subsequent
amendment of the underlying schedule; that is, Mr. Law
lied.
And I think there's a very strong reason why
the time limit shouldn't apply here.  Imagine that a
debtor took a fake set of exemptions and bribed the
trustee to look the other way for 30 days.  If that were
discovered on day 45, I think it would be thoroughly
implausible to think that you could -- that the debtor
could get the underlying exemption, something that he
bribed and lied about just because it didn't meet the
30-day requirement.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Maybe you get it from the
trustee.
MR. KATYAL:  I think that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The faithless trustee.
MR. KATYAL:  You might be able to go after
the trustee as well, but I don't think that the
underlying exemption would be given in that
circumstance.  It's a paradigmatic instance of both the
105(a) power as well as the inherent power of the Court.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I recognize the problem
that if you have sanctions, that he can't pay the
sanctions and you're right back where you started.  But
are there cases in which there are sanctions imposed of
an amount such as $75,000, $100,000?
MR. KATYAL:  Sure.  There's been a -- there
have been a number of cases, the red brief talks about
them at page 32 going all the way back, in which the
exemptions have been denied altogether for purposes of
bad conduct.  And we think this case falls within that.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. Hellman said that
the creditor and, I guess, any other party could not
object to the exemption on the ground that the house was
burdened with a fraudulent mortgage.  Do you agree with
that?
MR. KATYAL:  I don't.  I don't think
anything in the language of 522(l) so restricts it.
There are other provisions in the Code which say if an
objection has been made, for example, to a creditor
under Section 502, that the Court's power to deny that
relief is circumscribed in 9 different ways.  But there
is no restriction on the power of the Court here.
And that's why I think Justice Kagan's
question gets at this point, which is 522(k) assumes
that an exemption has been given, and there's a strong
reason under the Code the Court is given the power to
deny an exemption in the first place.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you have any authority
that says that there could be an objection on that
basis?
MR. KATYAL:  I think just the text at 522
itself says so.
If there are no other questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Harrington.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MS. HARRINGTON:  Thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
I'd like to start, if I could, by taking a
little bit of a step back to note that outside of the
bankruptcy system, an individual who runs up more debts
than they can satisfy with their collective assets has
no right to wipe out those debts while retaining some of
their property in the face of unpaid assets.  That right
only comes from the Bankruptcy Code itself.  But you
only get that right if you follow the rules of
bankruptcy.
The Petitioner asked this Court to
myopically focus on certain provisions of the Code and
only provisions of the Code that actually benefit the
debtor.  But you have to look at any provision of the
Code in the context of the whole Code itself because all
the provisions are intended to work together.
In this case, the surcharge order was
necessary and appropriate to enforce provisions such as
Section 521 and Section 704 of the Code.  Section 521
imposes duties on debtors.  Those duties include the
duty to honestly disclose assets and liabilities, the
duty to turn over property to the estate, to the
trustee, and the duty to cooperate with the trustee
throughout the case.
Now, Mr. Law flouted all of those
obligations, making it impossible to carry out the
provisions of those parts of the Code without
surcharging him in some way.
Section 704 imposes duties on the trustee.
Those duties include the duty to investigate the
financial affairs of a debtor and the duty to collect
the property of the debtor, reduce it to money and give
that money to creditors.  And the trustee doggedly
pursued his duties under Section 704, but because of Mr.
Law's bad faith litigation behavior, he imposed a great
cost on the exercise of those duties.
And so the Bankruptcy Court exercised its
discretion to try to offset some of those costs by
imposing a surcharge on what would have otherwise been
exempt property of the debtor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Harrington, you clearly
have the facts on your side.  The question is whether
you have the law.  And -- and 522(k) says, as
Justice Breyer said, "Property that the debtor exempts
under this section is not liable for payment of any
administrative expense."
Now, as I read your brief, you're
essentially asking us to put the word "usually" in that
provision.  Is not usually liable.  When is it -- when
is it liable?  It's -- it's liable when there are
special circumstances dealing with debtor dishonesty.
And where does that come from?
MS. HARRINGTON:  What we're asking to do is
look at all the provisions of the Code together.  And
certainly, Section 522(k) expresses Congress's policy
judgment that generally honest debtors should not have
their exempt property used to pay administrative
expenses.
But as I've said, 521 and 704 express
Congress's policy judgments about what debtors are
supposed to do and what trustees are supposed to do.
And Section 105 give -- gives Bankruptcy Courts
authority to address very unusual circumstances that
involve bad faith litigation conduct.  So that's bad
conduct in the litigation.
I think that is an implicit exception to
most of the general rules that are laid out in the
Bankruptcy Code.
In this case, it's really impossible for the
Court to have carried out all of the provisions of the
Code, but that's directly because of the debtor's
behavior in this case, Petitioner's behavior.  And so
here in this extraordinary circumstance, the Bankruptcy
Court addressed that bad faith litigation behavior by
exempting what otherwise would have been -- by -- excuse
me -- surcharging what otherwise would have been exempt
property.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is the -- you
do have good facts on your side.  But what if the
offense is simply the failure to list a particular
asset?  Does that justify a departure from the usual
rule?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I mean, if it's a
negligent -- negligent failure to list the asset, then I
don't think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No you know, it's a --
it's a bank account that's held in -- you know, a
separate name or it's separate real estate.  It's fairly
common for debtors to leave off some assets they want to
conceal.  Is that, as a general rule, sufficient to
justify this unusual authority?
MS. HARRINGTON:  I think if they do it in
such a way that then they spend the assets -- so the way
this issue usually comes up, the way it's come up in
most of the courts of appeals is that a debtor tries to
hide a nonexempt asset and then wastes the asset in some
way, usually by spending it, and then when it's
discovered, this is how it came up in the Malley case in
the First Circuit, then the Bankruptcy Court surcharges
the exempt property to sort of compensate the estate for
the wasted nonexempt property.
And so I think that -- that's certainly, in
our view, an appropriate exercise of authority under
Section 105, because there, the debtor is trying to --
he doesn't necessarily exit the bankruptcy with more
money than he would be entitled to, but he has more
money during the bankruptcy and he spends that money --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then it --
then it becomes a not very unusual exercise of
authority.  It becomes pretty common since the
concealment of nonexempt assets is a fairly -- I don't
want to say it happens all the time -- but it's a fairly
common situation.
MS. HARRINGTON:  I don't think it happens
terribly often, and when it does happen it isn't very
often that the debtor spends the money that he's
concealing.  He's usually trying to keep the money.  And
so if it's discovered that he has hidden an asset that
he should have turned over, then the Bankruptcy Court
can merely order him to turn over the money, to turn
over whatever the asset was.
It only -- it is only necessary to surcharge
what would otherwise be exempt property if that
nonexempt asset no longer exists.
Here, of course, it's a little bit of a
different situation.  This Petitioner imposed enormous
costs on the estate, radically depleted the value of the
estate by requiring the trustee to run up huge
attorneys' fees in order to effectuate his duties under
the code.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any case law --
because 522 says in (b), it says "The following property
may be exempt."  It doesn't say it has to be.  So is
there any case law where the debtor writes down -- you
know, a piece of property and a creditor comes in and
says:  He can't exempt that he has behaved outrageously,
and it fits within the category, but he has behaved
outrageously.
Is there any case law that says under those
circumstances the bankruptcy judge can refuse the
exemption one way or the other?
MS. HARRINGTON:  None that I am aware of.
And our view of the case is not so much that the
exemption was denied in this case, but that the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, you first have to
get to the thing where the -- we are pretending to put
the creditor, the bankruptcy judge, as if he were
another creditor.  The thing, the property, appears on a
list that says exempt.  And then the trustee or the
judge says:  No, I'm not going to let you exempt it.
And that's basically what he's done.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, the majority of the
cases, it's not so much that there's been an objection
to the exemption, so much as the exemption has been
disallowed at the end of the case or surcharged.
But I'm glad -- you know, in the
hypothetical you posited, it's the creditor who is
expending effort and potentially incurring attorneys'
fees in order to expose a debtor's fraud.  And in that
case, those would not be administrative expenses, and
you would think that, at least under the Court's
inherent authority -- under --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You see what I mean?  Not
only is it administrative expenses, but you have to
somehow say, well, the judge is a constructive creditor,
and he constructively objected.  There are an awful lot
of "constructive's" in that sentence that I just gave
you.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.  And, again, that's
not our view.  Our view is that the exemption was
disallowed, that the debtor is not allowed the benefit
of the exemption.
But if the creditor had been the one who ran
up the attorneys' fees, he could certainly be paid under
the court's inherent authority, as in Chambers v. NASCO,
and it would be strange to think that the trustee is the
only person who couldn't be paid in this sort of
circumstance just for doing what the code tells him he
has to do.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Harrington, at the
cert stage in this case, the Government suggested the
distinction between two situations:  One, an action by
the debtor to remove property from the estate, leaving
the creditors unsatisfied.
And that's where you say this power of
exemption can be taken away.  And then the other side
was where the creditors are paid in full and only the
trustee's litigation expenses are at issue.  Are you
dropping that distinction?
MS. HARRINGTON:  No, Justice Ginsburg, I
think -- I think the distinction we were trying to make
was more what I was discussing with the Chief Justice,
which is when a debtor wastes nonexempt assets and can't
turn them over, nonexempt property, can't turn it over to the
estate, and so then is forced to turn over exempt
property so that the surcharge doesn't pay attorneys'
fees; it just compensates the estate, and by extension
the creditors, for property that should have been turned
over.
Our suggestion was that this case, you could
decide the case on a narrow grounds and it wouldn't
necessarily resolve the issue in those other cases,
because in this case the sanction was to pay attorneys'
fees, which under a court's traditional inherent
authority, a court can order one party to pay another
party's attorneys' fees when it's in response to
extraordinary bad faith litigation conduct.
Now, even in Chambers v. NASCO, it's true
that the Court was divided in that case, but it was
mostly divided about whether the bad faith in that case
was in the litigation or before the litigation.  Here,
there is really no doubt that all of the bad faith
conduct in this case is in the litigation.  And that's
really a very traditional exercise of the court's
inherent authority to sanction that type of behavior
through attorneys' fees.
I think it's important to note also in this
case that the available remedies really are insufficient
to deal with this debtor's misconduct.  He suggests
dismissal, discharge, and Rule 11 sanctions.  Of course,
dismissal wouldn't do anything to punish him because his
creditors have been paid and he would just exit the
bankruptcy with all of the exempt property he would have
gotten if he had been honest.
The same thing with discharge.  He was
denied a discharge of his debts, but then after that the
trustee sold his house, and it sold for $300,000 more
than he had represented it was worth.  And so all the
creditors were paid.  And so that really had no
practical effect in this case.
It's also not clear that Rule 11 would be
sufficient to fully compensate the Trustee for the
expenses that have been incurred, because Rule 11
sanctions generally aren't available for matters on
appeal.
And as the record reveals, much of the
expenses that were incurred in this place -- in this
case resulted from the debtor's more than a dozen
appeals to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and to the
court of appeals.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not sure I understand
that.  Are you saying that the court could not just have
fined him, let's say, $100,000 or however much he
wanted, however -- whatever the costs were, and that he
could get that out of the debtor's future earnings?
MS. HARRINGTON:  So our view is that he
could have -- the court could have imposed a sanction,
and that would not have been a prepetition debt, so it
wouldn't have been discharged.  And if the court had
ordered the debtor to pay the money on pain of contempt,
he could have enforced that order notwithstanding any
State law provision that would have exempted the
property after the bankruptcy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Hellman, you have 5 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW S. HELLMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HELLMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Just a
few brief points in rebuttal.
I think from the litany of punishments that
the Government has pointed to in this case, the question
here is not whether a Bankruptcy Court can sanction a
dishonest debtor.  It can.  The question is what
sanctions has Congress forbidden or allowed.  This is a
case in which Congress has drawn a line and said exempt
property may not be used to satisfy any administrative
expense.
My second point is that I think there may
have been some confusion about what it is to claim an
exemption under the Bankruptcy Code.  If you look at
Section 522(b) of the code, what you'll see is that a
debtor is allowed to claim an exemption, may claim an
exemption, under State law or Federal law, depending on
the scheme that the State has opted into.
The right to the exemption is a product of
State law unless Federal law says otherwise.  And
Federal law has started to say otherwise in the
Bankruptcy Reform Amendments of 2005.  Congress saw a
problem in 2005 where debtors were pouring money into
their homesteads, then declaring bankruptcy, and then
seeking to have all of that property be claimed as
exempt.
Congress amended Section 522 to deal with
that problem, to place limitations on that type of
misconduct.  Congress has not created a generalized
equitable discretion exception to Section 522.  And I
suggest that the reason it has not done that is because
we're talking about exempt property, the core property
of the debtor.
And it would dramatically shift the power
between trustee, as the Chief, as Mr. Chief Justice was
suggesting, dramatically shift the power between the
trustee and the creditors and the debtor if a debtor's
homestead, pension, or wedding ring or other exempt
property becomes fair game and at issue if the trustee
makes a motion to suggest that the debtor hasn't behaved
as forthrightly as the trustee claims he should have.
And I want to stress again, at the risk of
repeating myself, we are not talking about the
traditional, venerable inherent powers of the Court to
award attorneys' fees.  There's a Rule 9011 in the
Bankruptcy Code.  It wasn't invoked here, shouldn't have
been invoked here.  But what we are talking about
instead is the property from which that sanction can be
satisfied.
Congress has determined that exempt property
cannot be used to satisfy administrative expenses.  The
worst prepetition conduct that one could imagine, say,
in a couple of narrow circumstances -- Congress has made
the choice here as to the status of exempt property.
In the RadLAX case, in the Ginsberg case,
and I'm not aware of any case to the contrary in
between, Congress -- the rule in this Court is the
specific provision controls.
Here, Congress has spoken specifically,
expressly, not by implication, but through prohibitive
language saying that exempt property is not available to
satisfy administrative expenses.
For those reasons, we would ask the Court to
reverse the surcharge order.  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
