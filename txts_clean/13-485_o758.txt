(11:16 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
in Case 13-485, Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland
v. Wynne.
Mr. Brockman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. BROCKMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BROCKMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
A State's broad power to impose a personal
net income tax on its own residents is grounded in the
special benefits that a State affords to its own
residents particularly because they are residents.  That
is, things like public schools, social services
programs, medical assistance services, and of course the
right to vote in the process that determines both the
level of those benefits and the level of taxes that are
paid in return for them.
There is no reason that a State should have
to subordinate this power, this taxing power, just
because another State, exercising an equally legitimate
taxing power, but on a very distinct ground, is taxing a
portion of that income merely because it was earned
within that State's borders.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right, you're relying on the
principle that life is not fair, right?
MR. BROCKMAN:  Life is not fair.  Maryland
taxes are.
(Laughter.)
MR. BROCKMAN:  Because all residents are
treated the same.  They are taxed on their entire income
regardless of where it is earned.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but as -- as
your friends on the other side point out in their
example at pages 22 to 23 of their brief, if you do the
internal consistency test, it ends up not being equal.
What it ends up is imposing a special tax -- they even
call it special, right, the special nonresident's tax --
on those who live in one State and work in the other,
that people who live in the State and work in the State
do not have to pay.  That doesn't sound -- that sounds
unequal, whether fair or not.
MR. BROCKMAN:  Your Honor, let me try and
explain why I -- why I disagree that it's unfair.  The
special nonresident tax and the county tax both apply,
one to residents, one to nonresidents.  One has been
upheld, the special nonresident tax, as a complimentary
tax to the other.
But we can abstract from all of that because
our position as a constitutional matter is that Maryland
is not required to provide a credit at all.
So, it would be just as accurate to do the
math this way.  The special nonresident tax accounts for
6/10ths of 1 percent of total personal income tax
collections, both resident and nonresident, combined
State and local.  If we've said instead there's only one
tax, it's a State income tax, and you may take a credit
up to the lesser of what you paid the other State or
99.4 percent of what you would have paid to Maryland,
whichever is lesser, we would have the same result.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's the case
now.  If we uphold the situation where you charge a
special nonresident tax in a way that is a special tax
on people who live in one State and work in the other,
then you're free to raise that to whatever amount you
want.  The fact that it's a smaller amount now
doesn't -- if we say it's okay, then you're free to
raise it.
MR. BROCKMAN:  Well, I don't think we are,
Your Honor.  It's been upheld by the Maryland courts
because it's complimentary and it's set at the lowest
rate that any county resident pays.  Many county --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It is now.  Do you
think there's -- could you increase the special
nonresident tax beyond the lowest rate that the county
tax is?
MR. BROCKMAN:  I don't think we'd try.  We
believe -- I think the reason it's set at the lowest is
because we did not want to be in a situation where we
were discriminating against nonresidents who are
entitled to --
JUSTICE BREYER:  To be specific, you live in
California.  You have a hot dog stand in Hawaii.  All
right?  It has a $1,000 income.  It comes back to
California.  You pay a 13-1/2 percent California tax.
Hawaii wants to charge another 12.  So you're paying 25
percent.  Can California say:  That's fine; we give them
no credit for the 11 percent they're paying in Hawaii?
So the bottom check that you get is $750, not a 1,000.
But if your hot dog stand were in California, the check
would not be 750, it would be approximately 900.  Okay?
Now, is that constitutional or not?
MR. BROCKMAN:  It is, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  That's what I
thought.  Then your answer --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Move -- move to Hawaii is
what you're saying.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And a lot of people do
that, for tax reasons.
MR. BROCKMAN:  Well, that's right, Your
Honor.  The Wynnes are our citizens, though, and we'd
prefer that they express their preferences through
voice, not exit.  But of course --
JUSTICE SCALIA :  A lot are moving out of
Maryland, too.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is your best case
that you can rely on for your answer to Justice Breyer?
What's the best case you can cite,Complete Auto?  I
don't think that works for you.
MR. BROCKMAN:  I wouldn't cite Complete
Auto.  I don't think it works here.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, I wouldn't if I were
you trying to justify the answer either.
What would you cite?  What would your best
cite be.
MR. BROCKMAN:  I might start with Jefferson
Lines because it demonstrates that there are situations
where only one claim -- State can claim to be taxing a
value on the specific basis it is taxing it on, but many
other States can be taxing it on a different basis.
That results in multiple taxation of the type that we're
talking about.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Here in my hypothetical the
basis is identical.  It's called an income tax, okay?
And they run it in both States the same, and the problem
that I would like you specifically -- and you are
addressing with Justice Kennedy -- is what California
says, open your hot dog stands in California.  You go
and open them in every other State and any other State,
but particularly Hawaii, you will pay $125 more in
income tax, not some flat other thing, not property tax,
not some other kind of tax, in income tax.  Okay.  Now,
that's constitutional because?
MR. BROCKMAN:  Because California taxes the
income from hot dog stands without regard to where the
hot dog stand is located.  The -- the additional tax
burden there is a result of the combination of two
States' taxes, Hawaii's and California's.  It can't be
said --
JUSTICE ALITO:  The question is not whether
California can tax the income of its residents wherever
they make it or whether California can tax all income
earned within the border of California.  The question is
whether it can do both, whether -- and that's the
question with respect to you.  Can you tax all income
earned within your border, whether by resident or by
nonresident, and also tax income earned by your
residents in -- in other States?
The tax economists' brief points out that
this -- what you've done operates exactly like a tariff,
because it provides an incentive to earn income in
Maryland and not outside of Maryland.  Now, do you
dispute that as a factual matter?  And if you don't
dispute it as a factual matter, why shouldn't this tax
system meet exactly the same fate as a tariff?
MR. BROCKMAN:  I don't dispute the
mathematics.  They lose me when they switch from tariffs
to income taxes, but I'm not an economist.  The
difference, though, is that the -- we're talking about
the effect of two States's taxes.  Now, they've talked
about two States' taxes by using what they call a
heuristic device of hypothesizing that the other State
has the exact same set of taxes.  Fine.  We can do that,
too.
But the point is that it's the combined
effect.  That means that Maryland's taxes, the validity
of Maryland's tax, will turn on how another State
exercises its taxing powers.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
MR. BROCKMAN:  Every State --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's my problem, is I
don't I understand why it is that California has to
yield in this California-Hawaii situation.  Why is it
that the State that taxes all the income of its
residents has to yield rather than the State that taxes
all income earned in the State?  Why can't you just as
well say, you know, Hawaii shouldn't be able to sock on
an addition?
MR. BROCKMAN:  Well, there are good
reasons --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, as far as fairness
is concerned.  Now, maybe it doesn't work the same way
with respect to the imaginary negative Commerce Clause,
but -- but as far as fairness is concerned, I don't -- I
don't see the difference.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your position -- your
position is that the residents -- the domicile can tax
worldwide income, period.  And I think everybody agrees
with that.  The question is:  Does the domicile have to
give a credit because somebody else is also taxing it?
Do you stop having the power to tax worldwide income
because other States may tax on a different basis?
MR. BROCKMAN:  I think that is the question,
Your Honor:  Must the State yield to another State's
taxation of a portion of that income, but on a very
distinct ground, a territorial ground?  It was -- the
argument that State would make is:  Well, we think you
earned it here, and if you did we have a right to tax
it.
Our argument with respect of our own
residents is:  We think you live here, and the Wynnes
indisputably do, and that you benefit from the same
privileges -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I was just
going to say it's not a question of yielding.  The way
you test under our precedents whether one State has to
yield or not is to say, well, let's suppose each State
does exactly the same thing, neither one is yielding.
And as indicated earlier, the example in the
Respondents' brief is that if each State did what we're
talking about, people who work in one State and live in
another would pay higher taxes overall than people who
live within one State and work in the same State.  And
that sounds to me like a tariff.
MR. BROCKMAN:  Well, perhaps this is another
way to address the internal consistency analysis and
demonstrate why we think it doesn't do very much good
analytic work here.  If you take just a single sentence in
one of this Court's opinions in Curry, "Income may be
taxed both by the state where it is earned and by the
state of the recipient's domicile," points internal
consistency, that's it.  If you add the feature that
there -- there's a credit or not, that's the issue here,
and if, as in Chickasaw Nation that the offering of that
credit is understood correctly as an independent policy
decision that states make and is not of constitutional
magnitude, is not done as a matter of constitutional
compulsion, then the internal consistency problem
remains.
We think the internal consistency test works
better, though not perfectly, when we're talking about
two states taxing on the same basis.  Because there, it
may detect instances where one state is overreaching
jurisdictionally, exercising a power that it does not
lawfully have.  The respondents don't argue that
Maryland lacks this power, they acknowledge it.  They --
and they acknowledge it as an attribute of Maryland's
sovereignty.  If it were Situs v. Situs, Source v.
Source, there the internal consistency test can tell
whether -- sometimes -- whether the multiple taxation,
the tax is a result of discrimination or of
extraterritorial application of laws.  But that neither
of those is present here --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not the Commerce
Clause test, though.  The cases where we've applied that
test, has that -- have they been decided under the
Commerce Clause?
MR. BROCKMAN:  The internal consistency
test?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
MR. BROCKMAN:  I think -- I think they
have --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought it -- I thought
it's a matter of state power.
MR. BROCKMAN:  Well, I think this case does
not present any issues that are unique to the Commerce
Clause case, because it's undisputed that Maryland's tax
does not facially discriminate.  It's even-handed in its
application.  Only after the tax liability is determined
does it take into account the source, and there it gives
an advantage to the people who have earned some of it
out of state.
So what we're left with is an argument of
the discrimination here is in the supposed
malapportionment itself.  And that question, the
question of apportionment, fair apportionment, I think
is common to both the due process and Commerce Clause
jurisprudence of this Court, and I think Maryland's tax
survives that scrutiny under both --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about -- we're
dealing with an individual because it's a Chapter S
corporation, but what about a corporation that is
domiciled in Maryland?  I think Maryland, like all
states, uses an apportionment formula for both domestic
and foreign corporations.
MR. BROCKMAN:  We don't believe this case
implicates any question of how corporations would be
taxed.  The residence principle that we're relying on as
a basis for the broad taxing power and the benefits that
one receives as residents is unique to individuals, and
it's always been articulated in cases involving
individuals, so we're talking about personal income
taxes here.  And it might very well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I suppose you could
argue that some states are very -- have very good
corporation laws and that's why corporations are
domiciled there.  They're, let's say, director friendly
or that they are laws that are easy to apply and well
understood.  That -- that's a significant advantage.
MR. BROCKMAN:  I think that's absolutely
correct, Your Honor.  I think this Court's precedents
recognize some benefit that's accorded merely in the
fact of domiciliary status, whatever -- however that's
defined.  And -- but being in the net income tax
situation for corporations, I'm not aware of any state
that tries to assign a value to that because
non-domiciliary and domiciliary corporations are treated
equally.
Now, I do know that Delaware, known to be
hospitable to corporations for incorporation purposes,
does impose a tax, a yearly franchise tax, that ranges
from $180 -- from $225 to $180,000 annually, and that
it's not based on income, it's based on a very complex
measure of the worth of the entire enterprise.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can we go back to the
Chief's initial question.  If we applied Complete Auto,
would you fail the internal consistency test?  And if
you fail it, why shouldn't we apply that test here?
Would you -- if we applied it, would you fail it?
MR. BROCKMAN:  I don't believe we would
because I think the proper construction of that test in
this situation asks about the internal consistency of
the rationale that Maryland is advancing, that is, are
we being consistent in our structure -- in structuring
our tax so that it reaches residents on their entire
income regardless of whether it's earned.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I must say I am confused
about what this case involved.  You argue, and I find it
surprising, that it involves both the Commerce Clause
and any other constitutional prohibition.  Okay?
Whereas your opponents, the question they say is
presented is whether a state tax that exposes interstate
commerce to double taxation is saved from invalidation
under the Commerce Clause, merely because the state --
why do you want to take on the whole Constitution when
they only want to argue about the Commerce Clause?
MR. BROCKMAN:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I thought it was the
latter that the case involves.
MR. BROCKMAN:  We'd be willing to defend it
under any provision of the Constitution.  But, Your
Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's big of you.
It really is.
MR. BROCKMAN:  And the chief concern that
this Court has articulated of its dormant Commerce
Clause protection -- jurisprudence, that is, protecting
against measures that are protectionist in nature and
benefit in-staters at the expense of out-of-staters is
not present here.  There is no discrimination or
extraterritorial overreaching, and the tax is valid.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MR. BROCKMAN:  I reserve.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
Mr. Feigin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. FEIGIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
I'd like to begin, if I could, by the
interaction of taxes imposed on the jurisdictional
rationale of residency, and taxes imposed on
nonresidents by virtue of their doing business in the
state.
I don't think there's any constitutional
rule that says a state can only impose one tax or the
other.  And to the extent the internal consistency test
might suggest that the special nonresident tax that
Maryland imposes, which is a special tax imposed only on
nonresidents, may be taking too great a portion of
nonresidents' income, I think it's kind of backwards for
respondents to be able to raise that challenge because
they are residents.  They pay only the residential
income taxes and, in fact, benefit from any overtaxing
of nonresidents.
The other thing I would --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You only have to look at the
tax scheme as a whole including the tax on nonresidents?
I mean --
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think the
very important thing to understand here is we're talking
about two very different kinds of income taxes with
distinct jurisdictional rationales.  Maryland is taxing
respondent's income because they are residents of
Maryland.  Other states are taxing their income because
they do business there.  I'm not sure you would
necessarily look at them and mix and match.  And I'm not
aware of any case in which this Court has taken a
completely nondiscriminatory tax -- like Maryland's
county income tax which applies at the same rate to a
county resident no matter where he earns his income in
state or out of state, and finds that tax to be
unconstitutional by yoking it to some other tax like the
special nonresident tax that's going to look
discriminatory no matter what other scheme of taxes you
throw it into.
But, if you really did think there was a
problem --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought that we held that
quite a lot in respect to corporate taxes.  The three
cases we found here, J.D. Adams, Gwin White & Prince,
Hennerford, Central Greyhound of New York, all said that
corporations, when they are taxed on their income by a
state, that they have to apportion in a fair manner.  Is
that right?
MR. FEIGIN:  No, Your Honor, I don't think
that that's precisely what they hold.  I think the most
salient distinction between those cases and this one is
that none of those cases address a tax that was
justified on the basis of the taxpayer's domicile as the
Maryland county income tax is.
In Gwin and Greyhound, the Court didn't even
address any argument that the tax was based on domicile.
And in J.D. Adams, although the highest court in Indiana
had -- believed that the tax was justified on the basis
of domicile, this Court looked at the structure of the
tax and concluded that it wasn't -- that that
justification didn't actually fit the tax.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When you say -- it seems
a little bit of hairsplitting.  You say it's a test on
residency, but not income.  But we have previously said
a tax on sleeping, measured by the number of pairs of
shoes you have in your closet, is a tax on shoes.  So
you can call it residency, but if it's still using
income as its basis as opposed to property values or
whatever else these residency taxes are based on, then
why isn't it a tax on income?
MR. FEIGIN:  Let me be as clear as I can,
Your Honor.  It is a tax on income, but the
jurisdictional rationale for the tax is different from
the jurisdictional rationales employed by the states.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's a due process
argument.  The question here is whether or not a number
of States impose taxes like this it would be additional
burden on interstate commerce.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, first of all, Your Honor,
if every State --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, that is the
question, isn't it?
MR. FEIGIN:  Yes, I think that is part of
the analysis of the question.
But if every State enacted an income tax
that looked exactly like Maryland's county income tax,
that applies one uniform rate no matter where income is
earned, every U.S. citizen would pay income tax at the
exact same rate no matter where they earned their
income.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Except if they also
imposed the special nonresident tax, and that changes
the whole scenario.
MR. FEIGIN:  That's right, Your Honor.
In addition to what I said to Justice Kagan
about that earlier, let me add a further thought, that
if you really thought there was a problem with the
interaction of resident and nonresident taxes then I
think it would probably be much more logical to locate
the problem in the nonresident tax rather than the
resident tax, for three reasons.
First, the nonresident tax is the only one
that's triggered by economic activity that crosses State
lines.  Maryland's county income tax applies whether the
business is done in State or out of State.
Second, any differential incentives that a
taxpayer might have to do business in one State versus
another aren't arising from the county income tax, which
applies evenly, but instead from the differential tax
rates that various other States which their nonresidents
might have.  So Illinois might impose a 3 percent rate,
Idaho a 5 percent rate, and Iowa an 8 percent rate.
And the third thing is that the resident tax
is the only one that the taxpayers actually have some
political power to get in there and to influence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In your answer that you
gave to my -- the hypothetical of 100 percent, that
would be a burden on 100 percent of interstate commerce,
because a resident who did not go into interstate
commerce would pay less, so there is a burden.  All
you're saying is, well, if there's going to be a burden,
it could be a great big one.
MR. FEIGIN:  So, Your Honor, there is -- in
some cases, a Maryland resident will be taxed more on
commerce that they conduct outside of Maryland then
inside of Maryland, but I don't see why that's
discrimination attributable to Maryland.  It arises from
the combination of the income taxes of two States.
And I think for the reasons I was just
explaining to the Chief Justice, one could file a
perhaps more persuasive brief challenging the
nonresident tax which the Maryland taxpayers exposed and
that's not a reason for invalidating the uniform
residence tax.
And, Justice Breyer, if I can get back to
your point.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Justice Kennedy asked a
question I was curious about that.  I wanted you to
address that specifically, and you're just trying to say
who's at fault.  I don't know who's at fault.
Switzerland has a tax on milk from cows that are
pastured at less than 5,000 feet.  It's Belgium's fault.
They don't have any mountains.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I don't know who's
at fault, but that is a discriminatory tariff.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I've
explained to explains why if someone has to be at fault,
I think it's the nonresident tax.  But let me explain
why I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see anybody at
fault.  Actually in the corporate area it was a tax on
gross income in that first case, and so I don't know why
human beings -- well, no, I won't go into that issue.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, it wasn't --
Your Honor, just quickly on J.D. Adams, in addition to
it not being a domicile-based tax, it was a tax on gross
receipts, which are taxes on transactions and the entire
revenue of those transactions.  But let me explain why I
think neither tax here --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, just to understand
what you said a minute ago, are you saying that if this
same claim were brought by a nonresident challenging the
nonresident tax in Maryland that would succeed?
MR. FEIGIN:  No, Your Honor.  I'm saying it
would be a stronger claim.  But let me try to explain
now why I think both taxes can peacefully coexist.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So that was
irrelevant, then., the fact that it would be -- it would
be a stronger claim, but also a bad one at the end?
MR. FEIGIN:  No, Your Honor, I don't think
it's irrelevant.  I think it's quite relevant because
the only tax that Respondents have paid and the only one
they are challenging is the even-handed residential
income tax, and the existence of this other tax that
could be perceived to have an undesirable affect
shouldn't affect the validity of the tax they've
actually challenged.  But let me explain --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But they are
linked -- they are linked together.  I mean, the special
nonresident tax is set at a particular level in relation
to the county tax.  It is obviously intended to reach
nonresidents in a way that the county tax reaches
residents.  I'm not sure you can artificially separate
them.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Maryland has upheld the
special nonresident tax, not on the ground that it's not
discriminatory.  The Maryland courts recognize the
special nonresident tax as discriminatory, which the
county income tax clearly is not, and they've upheld it
under this Court's compensatory tax doctrine.  Whether
the Maryland courts were right on that or whether they
wrong on that, I don't think it should affect the
validity of the county income tax, which is the question
presented in this case.
But the reason I think that nonresident
taxes can peacefully coexist with resident taxes is that
although they are both income taxes, they are on
distinct jurisdictional rationales, and when two taxes
are imposed on the same value based on distinct
jurisdictional rationales, it's not impermissible double
taxation under the Commerce Clause, and let me give an
example.
If an operation manufactures all of its
widgets in State A and sells them all in State B, it's
clear under this Court's decisions in McGoldrick v.
Berwind-White Coal Mining Company and Armco v. Hardesty
that State A can impose a manufacturing tax that is
measured by the value of the revenue of the sales even
though the sales occur in State B.  And State B can
impose a gross receipts tax on the sales that occur in
State B which is paid by the seller, the mining company
or the widget manufacturer in my example, which is also
taxed on that same value, the taxes that occur in State
B.
The reason that's permissible is because
they're distinct jurisdictional rationales, which is
what we have here.  One is a tax based on the residency
and the other is tax based on doing business in the
State.
Previous apportionment cases this Court has
considered have all involved the second rationale, doing
business in the State.  And in that circumstance, it
makes sense to try to divide up the pie because you
don't want California asserting, well, we're responsible
for 90 percent of your income, and Oregon says, we're
also responsible for 90 percent of your income.  But
there's no real way to compare apples and oranges and to
say that a residency-based tax is better or worse than a
tax based on doing business there.  And so you don't
have the same conflict between the taxes and have to
divide up the pie in the same way that this Court's
previous cases have suggested.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Feigin, if we were to
rule against Maryland, how many States are in the same
position as Maryland, either because they do a county
tax themselves or because they allow local jurisdictions
to impose their own taxes?
MR. FEIGIN:  I'd look at pages 17 to 18 of
the Municipal Lawyers Association brief, Your Honor, but
if I could add just one quick sentence beyond that.
Even States that do offer credits of the kind Respondent
is seeking would be affected by a decision in this case
because it would constitutionalize that requirement and
create constitutional questions about whether a credit
-- when a credit is required.
Thank you.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I have one more question.
Do we -- does the Federal Government allow
credits for all foreign income tax paid and do you think
it must do so?
MR. FEIGIN:  There are limits.  It does
offer a foreign income tax credit.  There are some
treaties about this, I believe, but I don't think
there's any overarching principle of international
law --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  In and of itself, it
wouldn't violate the negative foreign commerce clause,
right?
(Laughter.)
MR. FEIGIN:  I think if it did, Your Honor,
Congress could legislate that out of existence.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Perella.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOMINIC F. PERELLA
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PERELLA:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Justice Alito, you asked my friend on the
other side whether it's correct to say that if you
perform -- you know, if you look at the real economic
analysis of this tax and see what it does to interstate
commerce, whether it amounts to a tariff, and my
opponent conceded that it does.
A tariff is the quintessential unlawful tax
under the dormant commerce clause and I'd like to
illustrate why by pointing to Justice Breyer's hot dog
stand.  Again, as my opponent on the other side
conceded, a small business like a hot dog stand could
operate in two different States.  It might not be
California and Hawaii, but wherever it might be, and it
would be exposed to 100 percent double taxation.  The
only limitation would be the rate that the State chooses
to set on that.  And that would apply -- and I would
point the Court to page 5 of the Council on State
Taxation brief -- that would apply to 90 percent of the
businesses in this country.
JUSTICE BREYER:  When you do business in
California and you live somewhere else, your hot dog
stand is going to be subject to pretty high property
taxes.  It's going to be subject to special use taxes.
It's going to be subject to taxes that they have for one
time to finance the schools.  It's going to be subject
to da, da, da, da, da.  Okay?  And so what they are
really saying is, well, nobody claims that California
can't do that and Maryland can ignore it for purposes of
their income tax.  It's tough to do business in
California, according to some.  Not to Californians.
But nonetheless, this is just one more
burden that you have to suffer and that's because
they're on -- you heard the argument.  So what's your
response to that.
MR. PERELLA:  My response is that in cases
like Container Corp., Jefferson Lines, and others, this
Court has said:  Look, we can't and don't want to
constitutionalize everything about State taxation.
Different States impose different taxes, impose
different burdens, and we're not going to try to stop
them from doing so.  We can't stop them.  They have that
power.  But the line we're going to draw, and it's the
line the internal consistency test draws, is that we're
not going to allow States to structure their taxes so
that they are taxing more than one -- they're exposing
income to more than 100 percent of the tax base.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Perella, suppose we
had a Maryland resident and all that resident's income
is earned out of State.  And each of the States where
the income is earned tax at or above the Maryland rate.
That would mean, I suppose, that the Maryland resident
owes nothing to Maryland because he could take a credit
for all what he's -- leaving the residents without
anything, without a penny from this resident who may
have five children that he sends to school in Maryland.
MR. PERELLA:  Justice Ginsburg, a couple of
responses to that.  Firstly, I agree that it can happen.
I think it happens rarely.  And just as a practical
matter, let me point out Maryland has reciprocal
agreements with its surrounding jurisdictions --
Washington, Virginia, Pennsylvania, et cetera -- where
they say we're going to ignore commuting of that sort
and we're going to tax people at their residence.
But even if that weren't so, I think the key
point here is that that resident is paying substantial
taxes to State B, and residents of State B who happen to
do work in the State in Maryland are paying substantial
taxes to Maryland.  So this comes out in the wash.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Maybe -- no, maybe so, and
maybe -- maybe not so.  Why can't -- suppose not many
other people in -- in -- in Maryland are in -- in this
position, or the reverse?  This -- this man is getting a
free ride.
MR. PERELLA:  Well, I disagree respectfully,
Justice Kennedy, that he's getting a free ride.  I mean,
he's paying, first of all, again, substantial income
taxes to the other States where the income is earned.
He's paying substantial property taxes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But he's getting a free
ride off Maryland school.  Now he rents the property.
MR. PERELLA:  Two answers.  First of all, I
think important to point out that 42 other States don't
seem to have found this problematic.  Maryland is an
outlier here, and the other States are not here to
defend its rule.
But I also think it's worth mentioning that,
yes, there will be occasional cases where a State
resident does not pay any tax to the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can there be some minimum
tax imposed on a resident?
MR. PERELLA:  Minimum --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In Justice Ginsburg's
hypothetical, 100 percent of the income is earned from
out of State, and has five kids go to school, and they
use all of the local facilities.  Can Maryland impose
any tax based on residence?
MR. PERELLA:  I think the short answer to
that is if it's an income tax, no, under your
hypothetical, which is that he earns no income inside
the State.
But this Court has, you know --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What about a school support
tax?
MR. PERELLA:  You know, I think that it's
possible that you could impose a school support tax, but
then what --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you give me the right
numbers in what you said?  We've heard different ones.
You just said how many States provide a credit such that
a resident has to pay the higher of the foreign State's
tax on its business there, or the State's tax on income.
You said 40 States impose some kind of credit like that,
roughly?
MR. PERELLA:  No, Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What?
MR. PERELLA:  -- to be clear, every other
State has a credit, a full credit unlike the one --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So every other State.  How
many are the every other State?
MR. PERELLA:  It's 42 States.
JUSTICE BREYER:  42 States.  How many States
are in the position of Maryland where they don't impose
a credit -- or they do not grant a credit for some or
all of the income?
MR. PERELLA:  Zero.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Zero?
MR. PERELLA:  Wisconsin has a limitation on
its credit as one of the topside briefs points out.  The
limitation has to do with whether they credit taxes paid
to localities in other States, but Maryland is the only
State that limits its credit in this way.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, Maryland does --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, don't some States
allow localities to impose taxes that do not give a
credit?  So, for example, the New York City income tax
would be the classic example of that.
MR. PERELLA:  Yes.  Justice Kagan, as -- as
my opponent on the other side said, the IMLA brief
catalogs some foreign localities that impose local
income taxes.  Some of them don't appear to have a
credit.
But I think it's important to point out, and
we did in our responsive brief, that the IMLA's math is
substantially exaggerated.  I mean, for example, they've
pointed to -- a lot of the local taxes they point to are
in Pennsylvania.  Thousands of them in fact.  And
they're simply wrong about Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania
imposes a credit.  It just happens to be codified in the
State statutes.  And the same thing is true with Kansas.
They say Kansas is an example.  Kansas only imposes an
intangibles tax which operates --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you recognize that
there are jurisdictions, local jurisdictions, that
impose a tax and don't give a credit?
MR. PERELLA:  I think it's fair --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Just like this one.
MR. PERELLA:  I think it's fair to say that
there are some.  I think it's also fair to say that the
number is substantially lower.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But before you said there
were zero.
MR. PERELLA:  No, sorry, Justice Ginsburg.
I said that there are no States that don't impose --
that don't allow the full credit on other States' income
taxes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, Maryland does allow
the credit against the State income tax.  It's just the
county tax.
MR. PERELLA:  Well, I mean, not to split
hairs, but as this case comes to the Court, you know,
the State courts have held, and Maryland hasn't
disputed, that this is, in fact, a State income tax.
The court held that in Frey case in the Maryland Court
of Appeals.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  But they -- the
lion's share of it would be this State part, not the
county part.  And on that, Maryland does give a credit.
MR. PERELLA:  I think the key point here is
that if you conceive of this all as a State tax, which
is how, again, how the Maryland law stands and how the
case comes to the Court, what Maryland has done here is
say we're going to arbitrarily cut our credit
essentially in half.  We're going to give you half the
credit.
Now, some of the topside briefs, the IMLA
brief, for example, make an issue of that.  They say,
hey, this is just a rational compromise; we're going
part way.  But the rule Maryland suggests is not a
compromise.  The rule they suggest is you can impose
complete double taxation.  And it's a rule --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Perella, you're not
saying that we have to or that we should establish a
priority rule as to different taxing schemes, do -- are
you?  You're not saying it has to be source-based over
residence-based, or -- or vice versa?
MR. PERELLA:  I think that the holdings of
this Court in Standard Oil, Mobil Oil, Central Railroad,
are that in a situation where one State is taxing on the
basis of residency and the other on the basis of source,
it is the State of residency that yields.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you are saying that
that's the priority rule.
MR. PERELLA:  Well, I'm saying that in the
case where there is the risk of overlap, yes.
Now, the other side has construed our brief
saying that we're requiring apportionment, right?  The
whole point of their reply brief is how can it be that
the due process cases say you tax everything wherever
earned, and the Commerce Clause requires you to tax
nothing outside the State.  I want to just be clear that
that's not the rule we're suggesting.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, let me ask you:  I
mean, suppose we were to say what Maryland is doing is
not okay, but then States could choose.  Some would do a
source-based tax, some would do a residency-based tax.
And if you had a situation like that, it seems it could
lead to double taxation in exactly this kind of way.  If
you were living in the wrong State and all of a sudden
the combination of one State having a pure source-based
and one State having a pure residency-based tax was
going to lead to double taxation.  Why is that any
different?
MR. PERELLA:  So I think that if you had
that situation, and of course you don't because all the
States do this the same way, but if you had it, I think
there would be an argument to be made that that tax
would be unconstitutional because it would produce
massive double taxation.  And, you know, the Court has
said residency yields in that situation.
But I want to be clear that this is a much
easier case.  Here we have a situation where the tax is
simply not internally consistent.  And, Justice
Sotomayor, to answer your question earlier, there's --
there's no way to argue that it is.  And Maryland to
this -- to this day refuses to actually apply the test.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it's only
internally inconsistent because of the special
nonresident tax.  And your -- your clients don't pay the
special nonresidents tax, so why should we worry about
it in this case?
MR. PERELLA:  The reason you have to worry
about it in this case -- and let me say, Mr. Chief
Justice, there are other ways to -- to rule in our favor
without doing internal consistency.  But if that's the
approach that you take, the only way the internal
consistency test makes any sense is if you look at both
the residence tax -- you know, the inbound tax and the
outbound tax.  Because the whole point of the test, as
the economists' brief points out, is to look at what
happens when two States have the power to tax, one on
the basis of residence and one on the basis of source.
So to suggest that you would only look at
the inbound piece makes nonsense of the test.  That's
not how it's ever been applied.  I'd like to --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  A resident -- you're not
disputing the proposition that the State of residence
can tax worldwide income, can impose an income tax on
its residents worldwide, wherever they earn it.  You're
not questioning that proposition.
MR. PERELLA:  I'm not questioning that as a
matter of due process.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, as a matter of
what?  Would you question it as a matter of a dormant
Commerce Clause, that the State of residence can tax
worldwide income?
MR. PERELLA:  Would I question it as a
matter of the Commerce Clause?  I think the gravamen of
our position, Justice Ginsburg, is that States have the
raw power, right, putting aside all other factors and
all other States' taxes, to reach their residents'
income wherever earned.  But the Commerce Clause
operates to force them to structure their taxes in a way
that avoids double taxation.
Now, there will be --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then what you're
saying is they don't have the power to tax worldwide
income --
MR. PERELLA:  No, that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- if another State has a
tax based on source.  So, going in proposition, they can
tax worldwide income, is subject to what other States
do, and if other States have a tax, then the resident's
State has to recede.
MR. PERELLA:  Two answers to that, Justice
Ginsburg.  First, under our position, which is not
something we've invented for purposes of this case, but
is the steady holding of this Court for 80 years, the
question is not what other States are actually doing.
The question is whether Maryland's tax is structured in
such a way that eliminates the pervasive risk of double
taxation.
Because, of course, as the Chief -- as -- as
the Chief Justice pointed out in the opening argument,
other States can exercise their right to tax on the
basis of source to any degree.  And so what this Court
has said is we're not going to make the
constitutionality of the tax turn on the shifting
incidents of the other 49 States.  We're going to
require that you structure your tax so you're not going
to open the door to all this double taxation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You talked about what
this Court has been doing for I don't know how many
years.  Have we ever had a case under the Dormant
Commerce Clause where a resident is complaining, an
insider is complaining.  The Dormant Commerce Clause
cases involved outsiders who are saying, this State
where I don't vote is imposing something arbitrary on
me.  Here we have an in-state person complaining under
the Dormant Commerce Clause that its State is
discriminating against it.
Is there any other State where -- case where
it's an insider complaining --
MR. PERELLA:  Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- rather than an
outsider?
MR. PERELLA:  There are -- there are a
number of cases, and let me give them to you.  Boston
Stock Exchange, for starters, is a resident complaining
about their own tax.  The complete audit -- or the
Commerce Clause was imposed.  Goldberg is the same,
although you ruled against the taxpayer in that case;
the test was applied.  And most importantly, I think,
J.D. Adams, Gwin and Central Greyhound are all
domiciliaries.  Now, they are, of course, corporations.
But my opponent, I don't think, has offered
any rationale to distinguish between the two.  The
question this Court has always identified is:  Is this
tax double taxing --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, one thing, one
obvious distinction is the corporation doesn't have five
children to send to school.
MR. PERELLA:  Well, you know, I think that
that rationale maybe proves a little bit too much.
Because, of course, corporations do receive an awful lot
of benefits from their domiciliary States, and
especially the States where they have their principal
place of business.  And I would argue, although there's
no, you know, empirical evidence in the record, that
they probably use more in the way of services -- fire,
water, structure, legal, you know, legal mechanisms,
et cetera -- and yet this Court has said, you absolutely
cannot double tax and it's forbidden.
And, you know, again, Maryland is -- the
only distinguishing factor they have for those cases --
and actually this is an important point I would like to
address -- the only point either Maryland or the United
States has used to distinguish J.D. Adams and the like
is the idea that the tax in those cases was on gross
receipts.
That argument has been long since
foreclosed.  This Court held in Moorman, both the
majority and the concurring opinion, that there is no
analytical difference between net and gross income in
this area.
And furthermore, in Westinghouse v. Tully,
the Court said, look, there's no difference for our
analysis between the tax and -- a burdensome tax imposed
on interstate transactions and a burdensome tax --
excuse me -- a burdensome tax imposed on interstate
income.  They said it cannot be, quote/unquote, that you
can impose that unlawful burden by doing it in the
aggregate.
And so I think the idea that that
distinguishes our cases is not available to them.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Perella, we said in this
American Trucking case, we said we were going to allow
States to impose a neutral, local tax even though it
violated internal consistency.
Why shouldn't we see this as pretty
equivalent to American Trucking?  In other words, a
State saying, we're going to impose a small tax to
ensure that you are paying for some of the very basic
services that we provide.
MR. PERELLA:  Well, I guess several
responses, Justice Kagan.  First of all, there's nothing
small about this tax.  Maryland is imposing, by their
own lights, $50 million in double taxation on its local
businesses annually when they operate across State
lines.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sure that if you
aggregate the American Trucking tax, it was a lot of
money, too.
MR. PERELLA:  Maybe.  The distinction
that -- that Justice Breyer drew for the Court in that
case was that in American Trucking it was a fee.  It was
a flat fee and it was imposed only on intrastate
transactions.  He said no interstate transactions, no
interstate commerce appears to be at issue in this case.
In this case, by striking contrast, Maxim,
the S corporation that earned this income, operates
essentially in every State in the country.  And, of
course, under S corporation principles, the income that
the Wynnes earned through that is  passed through income
just like a partnership.
And furthermore, you know, if you look at
the -- how the tax affects other State residents, again,
90 percent of businesses in this country are organized
as passthrough entities or sole proprietorships.  And so
you have all of that income crossing State lines, and
every time it does, there's a tariff, there's a barrier
at the State lines that says you're going to pay twice.
And this Court has never, I don't think, approved a tax
like that.  American Trucking certainly did not.
I'd like to -- to mention a couple of other
things.  The IMLA brief and Maryland's reply brief
suggest that if you accept our position, Maryland has no
choice but to make its tax code more  regressiveI'd
just like to point out that that's not so.  Maryland, to
take just one example, could raise the top marginal
income tax rate to close the gap.  That would impose the
difference only on, you know, higher income citizens and
it would not double tax anyone.  The thing that
Maryland --
comfort?
make?
makes --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why should that give me
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What difference does that
MR. PERELLA:  Well, I don't think it
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where the only way out is
to -- is to -- I don't understand the argument.
MR. PERELLA:  Justice Scalia, Maryland can
close the gap however it likes.  It can raise the
property tax --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what I think.
MR. PERELLA:  It can raise the income tax
generally.  The point that I wanted to make is that if
the suggestion is that this tax is somehow unfair
because, as a -- as a necessary result you're going to
soak people with lower incomes, that's simply not so.
That's not what Maryland has to do to the fix the
problem here.
And, again, this is a problem that only
Maryland has.  Every other State with an income tax
allows the credit in full.
Let me also mention another argument
Maryland makes in its reply.  It suggests that
S corporation owners or S corporations should not be
heard to complain about double taxation because
C corporations are double taxed.  That misunderstands
the concept of double taxation in Commerce Clause cases.
In a C corporation, you have the first tax imposed on
the, you know, the corporation itself, and then down the
line you have a tax imposed either by the same State or
another on the -- on the person who's getting a
dividend.
That's not the same person being taxed
twice, nor is it anyone being taxed twice for crossing
State lines.  And so both the dividends recipient and
corporation are indifferent to where they live and where
they work.  There's no double taxation there in the
sense of the hydraulic pull, pulling the commerce into
single State.  And in fact, in that respect, it's just
like Jefferson Lines.  In that opinion, this Court said,
"The reason this is different from Central Greyhound and
the only reason we're not striking this tax down is
because the first incidence falls on the bus ticket
buyer, and the second incidence falls on the bus
company.  And so no one discouraged from crossing state
lines."  That's not how the Maryland tax operates.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What if they didn't do
it on gross income, but just said every resident has to
pay X amount?
MR. PERELLA:  As an income tax?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  As an income tax.
MR. PERELLA:  I think the result would be
the same.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not being based on
gross income.  Just says every resident has to pay
$1,000.
MR. PERELLA:  Justice Sotomayor, I think the
result would be the same because -- and as I stand here,
I'm thinking about this -- I believe it would be the
same because the question would be, as the Chief Justice
points out, is the tax internally consistent.  And, you
know, that sounds obscure but all it's really saying is,
is that tax creating a risk of pervasive double taxation
for anyone who does interstate commerce.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why doesn't Justice
Sotomayor's hypothetical, isn't it exactly the same as
the American Trucking hypothetical?  You just
distinguished the flat tax versus the percentage income
tax.  I thought that that was your principal distinction
of American Trucking.
MR. PERELLA:  I think -- I think that the
thing about American Trucking that made it unique,
Justice Kagan, and I confess I don't completely
understand the rationale of American Trucking, but I
think the thing that makes it unique is that it's a flat fee
for use of the State services.  That's what Justice
Breyer said to the Court in that case.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I thought that that was what
Justice Sotomayor was positing, a flat fee for use of
the State schools and everything else that comes along
with being a State resident.
MR. PERELLA:  All right.  Well, perhaps,
then, you know, maybe that tax could survive under the
rationale ofAmerican Trucking too.  But, again, I think
it's important to point out this is not that case.  I
mean, this is a case where it's clearly an income tax.
It's clearly pegged to, you know, adjusted gross income
and it clearly does not offer the credit that every
other State offers.
And, you know, I think just to illustrate
how this -- how this functions in reality, the other
side suggests, well, this is just some sort of -- we're
asking for a special benefit for -- for, you know,
people who own these big interstate companies.  If you
own, for example, an independent taxi and you happen to
take rides, give people rides across the line into
Delaware and Pennsylvania, you're going to be double
taxed, under their theory, on any piece of that commerce
that can be taxed by Pennsylvania or Delaware.  Whereas,
the exact same operation that happens to be an
incorporated bus company could not be constitutionally
double taxed.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But, you know, there --
there's an inequity either way.  The inequity on the
other side is you have two neighbors side by side.
Their kids both use the school.  One of the neighbors
makes most of his income out of the State and you want
to say that would not be taxable, whereas the other
neighbor makes all of the income in the State and pays a
very high, very high tax.  You know, that's not fair
either, is it?
MR. PERELLA:  Three responses, if I could,
Justice Scalia.  First response, as I mentioned earlier,
it's going to work the other way as well.  If you look
at this across 50 States without State lines, as you're
supposed to for Commerce Clause purposes, people who are
nonresidents are going to be paying taxes into the
State.
Secondly, even if there is some inequity
there, the lodestar of this Court's Commerce Clause
cases has always been that whatever else you do, you
can't create the substantial nationwide risk of double
taxation.  So that has to be the first principle.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's quite
interesting, because New York City's normal population,
I think now we have gone down to 7 million, but
out-of-state residents that come in are 25 million a
day, who work in the city.  So, New York's 7 million
pays for those 25 million.
MR. PERELLA:  I'm not sure totally sure how
the New York City income tax regime works, Justice
Sotomayor, but I think the point I was driving at is,
you know, States have different policy preferences.  You
know, they want to have a tax on this and a tax on that,
that's almost always --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What's your third?
MR. PERELLA:  Yes, that's what I was getting
the line is drawn at the idea that you can't double tax.
And the third point I was going to make is,
you know, Maryland is complaining about a very small cab
of limitation that this Court always enforced on their
taxing power.  And as this Court has said in a number of
decisions dating all the way back to Chief Justice
Marshall, States have some limitations on what they can
do with taxation under the Commerce Clause, but what
they bought in exchange for, you know, agreeing to those
limitations in the Constitution is a nationwide network
of commerce.  They don't have barriers at State lines,
there are no tariffs as Maryland admitted this functions
as.  They can -- you know, they can take advantage of
that nationwide network and they can market their goods
and they can market their employees in any State in the
country and vice versa.  And so I think the idea that
this is a one-way ratchet and that Maryland is only
losing in this proposition is not correct.
And just as a final matter, let me just say,
with respect to the idea that residency is a
get-out-of-jail-free card, I'd like to quote Chief
Justice Marshall from Brown v. Maryland.  "The
distinction between the tax on the thing imported and on
the person of the importer can have no influence on this
part of the subject.  It is too obvious for controversy
that they interfere equally with the power to regulate
commerce."
I think that's the bottom line here.  And if
the Court has no further questions, I'll submit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Brockman, you have three minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. BROCKMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BROCKMAN:  Thank you.  The bottom line
is not that a tax on the thing is the same as a tax on
the person.  That is true in the trilogy of cases that
the Wynnes mostly rely on, the J.D. Adams cases where the
gross receipts tax is understood, at least at that time,
to be very different from a net income tax going all the
way back to 1918 in U.S. Glue.  And the reason was
because it was viewed as taxing the transaction itself.
The net income from the transaction is different.  It's
the thing that the person receives and enjoys in their
home State.  And people choose to live in States for
reasons different from the ones that they consider when
they choose to do business elsewhere.  They may choose
because there are lower property taxes relative to sales
taxes, as in Maryland.
Maryland is not unique.  The Chief Justice
can probably correct me if I'm wrong about the number,
but there are 92 counties in Indiana and they all impose
a local income tax.  None offers a credit.  So -- and --
and the fact that other States aren't here is just a
harbinger because if this becomes a constitutional rule,
they will be.
The reason we have offered a compromise and
why it is a compromise, is because -- because this tax
falls on the State's own residents, they have the
capacity to change it.  That's always been an important
consideration from McCullough all the way through United
Haulers.  And the norm that -- that supposedly prefers
source to -- to residents as a basis is nowhere to be
found.  It's -- it's a norm only.  And in Bernard v.
Brooks, in answer to Your Honor's question, this Court
said that the United States has never believed that when
it decides to limit its own sovereign taxing power over
its own residents that it's doing it because it has to.
It's never been thought that.  And the States could not
have thought that when they were joining the union, that
the unique relationship between a State and its own
residents would be -- could not be accounted for in the
State's tax system, that the Constitution would
determine how, as Mr. Perella says, the States can
structure their own taxes.
Maryland made some choices and they ought to
be able to make the choices they did.  They said that
the taxes one pays to the county should not be different
based on factors that the county services are
