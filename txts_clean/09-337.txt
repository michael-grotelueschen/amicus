CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear
argument this morning in Case 09-337, Krupski v. Costa
Crociere, S.p.A.
Mr. Bendure.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. BENDURE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BENDURE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This case revolves around Rule 15(c)(1)(C)
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In pertinent
part, if two subsections are -- are satisfied, the rule
permits relation back of an amendment adding a new
defendant after expiration of the limitations period.
The courts below found, and Respondent does
not question, that we satisfied the first subsection:
Notice and no prejudice. That arose from the service of
the original complaint upon Costa Cruise, the agent and
corporate affiliate represented by the same attorney as
Respondent Costa Crociere.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know, Mr. Bendure,
what exactly the corporate relationship was between the
two?
MR. BENDURE: No, Your Honor, not the
corporate relation. The functional relationship as
described in the affidavit is that Costa Cruise is the
booking agent for Costa Crociere. And for the notice
procedure, according to the affidavit of Mr. Klutz,
Costa Cruise engaged the IRSI adjustment service to
resolve claims arising on the ship. So in that respect
it was also, in our view, an agent of Costa Crociere.
But the specific corporate relationship is not known.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.
MR. BENDURE: Because of that timely service
on Costa Cruise, we satisfied the first subsection. And
as this Court noted in Schiavone, timely service on one
defendant may serve to give imputed notice to a related
defendant, which is what we have here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your --
your client tripped over the cable, right?
MR. BENDURE: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the case
were there were two people behind her and she was
pushed? And she didn't know which one pushed her, Jones
or Smith. So she sues Jones, and Smith knows all about
it because, of course, he's a key witness or whatever.
Can he be substituted later on because he was the person
she should have sued?
MR. BENDURE: If you're talking about a lack
of knowledge of the real name, probably --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not just the real
name. It's not that Jones pushed her, but his real name
is Johnson. It's that Jones -- whoever pushed her; I
forget -- but one guy --
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the people pushed
her, and she named that -- she named the other person. She
made a mistake about who pushed her. Can they have
substitution in that case?
MR. BENDURE: I would say yes, because --
again, assuming that all of the other criteria are
satisfied.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. The non-pusher
has notice --
MR. BENDURE: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and everything else.
But there’s no relationship between the two of them.
MR. BENDURE: It's -- it's obviously a
slightly different and more difficult case from our
perspective, but what I think is critical is the status
that's involved. In this particular case, the suit was
filed against the vessel operator, and that vessel
operator was identified as Costa Cruise, when we know
that the actual identity was Costa Crociere.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the first --
when was your first notice of that? I mean, it was on
the first page of the ticket, but the answer came after
the statute of limitations. Was that your first notice
that there was this different entity, or did you know
that earlier?
MR. BENDURE: It was -- we say that was the
first notice. Now, the circuit court used an imputed
knowledge rationale to suggest that the inclusion of the
name "Costa Crociere" within the definitions section
gave us what I would call constructive notice. But in
terms of actual knowledge that -- that we had sued the
wrong party, it was the answer which was filed after --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't -- I didn't
understand you to deny that the ticket made it very
clear who operated the ship.
MR. BENDURE: I'm not sure --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you contest that?
MR. BENDURE: I contest that it makes it
very clear, but I don't contest that one could conclude
that that provided constructive notice, that if read
carefully one might infer.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why not? Don't you
read the contract carefully before you bring a lawsuit?
MR. BENDURE: Well, actually it was under
definitions. And according to the definitions, Costa
Crociere fell within the same definition of "carrier" as
the steward, the ship itself, any --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you are -- you either
are contesting or you’re not contesting that it's clear
from the ticket. I had assumed it was clear from the
ticket.
MR. BENDURE: I’m not -- I am not agreeing
that it's clear. I am agreeing that it provides
constructive notice from which one might infer that.
Not clear, but discernible.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you had -- so then you
had notice even before the suit was filed. It was on
the -- it was on the ticket.
MR. BENDURE: We had what the circuit court
referred to as “imputed knowledge.” Now, I think there's
a --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the -- did the name
show up any place other than page 1 of the general
conditions of passage?
MR. BENDURE: I don't believe so, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- and this is
what? An 11-page, very small print --
MR. BENDURE: It's an 11-page, small print
document. And one thing that bears mention is that
reference is under the designation "Definitions,"
because Respondent makes some hay out of the fact that
we complied with other requirements which are under a
different heading which says "Limitations of liability."
But what we also had was that we purchased
the ticket from Costa Cruise; it was sent by Costa
Cruise. We had the pre-suit notice sent to Costa
Cruise, responded by the -- the gentleman under the
heading "Costa" that says "claims administrator for
Costa Cruise." So there was certainly what I would call
conflicting information at best about which was the name
of the actual vessel operator.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not if you read the
definitions on page 1. And if you are not going to read
all 11 pages before you file suit, I would think you
would at least read page 1. And that, it seems to me,
made it clear.
MR. BENDURE: Well, it -- well, under the
same definition, the steward would be a carrier every
bit as much as Costa Crociere, S.p.A. So it seems to me
by that reasoning you could conclude that the steward or
the janitor is the vessel operator because they are
likewise defined as the carrier in that definitional
section.
And, in fact, it also includes the vessel
itself within the definition. So let's assume that my
client had, instead of suing Costa Cruise, sued Costa
Magica, the name of the vessel itself. Most of the
cases would say that an amendment like that to add the
actual name, once you have identified the status of the
defendant you seek to sue, falls within the
subsection (ii), which is addressed primarily to the
constructive notice of the defendant, that they knew or
should have known that they would have been brought in
the suit but for a mistake concerning the proper party's
identity.
But the general focus of that second subsection,
I think, is to look to whether this defendant knew or
should have known that it was the intended target.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me -- I’ve been
thinking about the Chief Justice's question where the two
people are pushed and you don't know which person -- or
two people fired the shotgun, and there’s only one pellet,
and you don't know which gun the pellet came from. In
that case, I think we could stipulate that even by
reasonable inquiry, you wouldn't know.
In your case, I think the -- and I think the
difference in the case is that "reasonable inquiry"
means you should have known. So now we have a rule that
excuses something you should have known but doesn't
excuse something you -- you couldn't have known, which
seems odd. And because it's odd, therefore, maybe
that's why it only applies to clerical errors.
MR. BENDURE: Well, actually when it talks
of mistake, it seems to me that the very notion of
mistake connotes error. I looked at a couple of
definitions, dictionary definitions. Merriam Webster's
defines a mistake as, quote, "a wrong judgment" or,
quote, "a wrong action or statement proceeding from
faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or inattention."
So, at least in that colloquial sense, the very nature of
mistake implies some measure of blameworthiness.
And, indeed, it's hard to conceive of a
mistake that couldn't be avoided. And I think that's
the problem with looking to the ticket, because what the
definition on the ticket essentially says is: With due
diligence, you might have avoided the mistake.
But in my view, and I think in the view of
the language of the rule, that doesn't change the very
nature of it as being a mistake.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --
MR. BENDURE: Certainly.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- assume I accept
your argument, and I am the cruise operator -- the
cruise owner, cruise ship owner, and I look at the
complaint, and I say: I think they really meant me,
but -- I think. Now, within the 4(m) period, which is
the period in which I am supposed to reasonably know
that I would have been named absent a mistake, here an
answer is filed, and you are told there is a mistake,
and you don't correct the mistake. What conclusion
would a reasonable person at that second juncture make
about whether you made a mistake or not?
MR. BENDURE: I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I think that's what
the issue is here, which is, assuming the complaint
could be read as a mistake during the 4(m) period,
wasn't that mistake corrected, and you refused or failed
to act?
MR. BENDURE: Let me respond both legally
and factually. Legally, I submit that it doesn't make a
difference because under the text of the rule if during
that 4(m) period they had the knowledge that you're
suggesting and which would be suggested by the
Respondent when they say, I think, if you had filed the
amended complaint and served it a month after the answer,
it would have been timely, we would have done it.
That acknowledges that there was a mistake,
and once there is a mistake, if during that 120-day
period they knew or should have known that it would have
been brought against them but for the mistake, that
knowledge doesn't evaporate by later events, as long as
there is knowledge during that period.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That makes so little
sense to me. Here I think -- and for the following
reason: You seriously I don't think could contend that
if you had sought to amend a year later, that that would
have been timely, correct?
MR. BENDURE: Correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But putting
aside prejudice --
MR. BENDURE: Okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what the lower court
said was because your delay speaks to a choice, that
that's the only thing a reasonable defendant would have
assumed, that having been told that you sued the wrong
party and you continued in that action, that that's what
you intended to do, to sue that wrong party.
MR. BENDURE: Let me point out factually --
and I did not stress it in my brief. The answer was
filed on February 25th. Twenty-three days later, on
March 20th, the court entered a scheduling order which
said: You have until the end of June to amend your
complaint to add parties.
So it seems to me that a defendant faced
with a court order that says the time for amendment
extends till the end of June would not be drawing any
conclusions that the plaintiff's state of mind had
changed. And one difficulty with trying to look at
different points during the 120-day period is that it
seems to me you'd have a constantly moving target.
If you say that we satisfied 120(m) at one
point in time but somehow that's not enough and at a
later point in time maybe they didn't know it any more,
and then perhaps I guess in theory you could have them
again -- if we had sent them a letter even after that and
said, you know, we really did mean it, and then for some
reason they concluded otherwise, you'd have a constantly
moving target. And that's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bendure, would you
explain one factual matter to me? I might have gotten
this wrong, but I thought the answer was filed after the
year had run.
MR. BENDURE: It had. It had.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So when the answer was
filed it was too late for you to come within the statute
of limitations.
MR. BENDURE: Absolutely true.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I thought that would be
the answer that you would give to Justice Sotomayor,
because when you got the answer -- which was filed after
how many days?
MR. BENDURE: It was filed I think 24 days
after the complaint.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you had gotten that a
few days earlier, you could have amended, and then we
wouldn't be here.
MR. BENDURE: That's certainly true, Your
Honor. And I think it also --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You have
0 days to amend, don't you, from the filing of the
complaint?
MR. BENDURE: No, Your Honor. The 120 days
is the time frame for the notice to the defendant.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.
MR. BENDURE: It -- 120 days after the amended
complaint is our time for service of the amended --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Complaint.
MR. BENDURE: -- complaint on the new defendant.
But I think the point that is raised by Justice Ginsburg is
this: Once we find out and the limitation period has already
expired, school's out. If we tried to amend immediately
thereafter -- if we hadn't made a mistake -- we couldn't
amend 1 day after expiration of the limitation period.
So if we had acted immediately, we still
don't get relation back unless we've satisfied the two
criteria of the subsections. But if we do satisfy those
within the 120-day period, then we fall in the safe
haven provided by the rule whether the amendment itself
occurs 1 week, 3 weeks, or 7 weeks afterwards. That --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the basic point is
the answer didn't come in until you were already out
under the statute of limitations.
MR. BENDURE: Correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So from their point of
view, nothing else matters; you were out when they filed
their answer, and you could do nothing to cure that.
MR. BENDURE: We could do nothing to, as a
matter of right, file within the limitation period.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did your amended complaint
contain any new and material allegations other than the
name correction?
MR. BENDURE: It actually was a second
count, but it was the same allegations against Costa
Crociere that had been made against Costa Cruise. We
did not amend the theories of liability. And, again,
getting back to the question of status and theories, I
think that's the critical distinction between this case
and the cases they rely upon, Ish Yerushalayim and
things like that, where you're changing from an
individual defendant to an institutional defendant or
vice versa on a different theory. And, of course, you
couldn't mistake an individual for an institution.
And that I think is the line of demarcation
that we’re asking the Court to draw, and it explains
why in the lower courts the decisions which present our
paradigm all or virtually all allow relation back;
whereas, those that seek to amend a change from an
individual to a corporation or vice versa often don't
permit relation back.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the only
condition was that it had to arise out of the same event
or transaction, which would give you much more running
room than -- than what you assert.
MR. BENDURE: Only if you’re amending
against the same defendant. If you are adding a new
defendant, you have to satisfy (i) and (ii), which look
to the notice and reason to know of the new defendant.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bendure, in addition
to the mailing of the ticket -- the mailing of the
ticket came; it said "Costa Cruise" -- were there any
other connections between the plaintiff passenger and
Costa Cruise beyond the ticket coming in an envelope
that says "Costa Cruise"?
MR. BENDURE: There was the -- the pre-suit
claims notice which was sent to Costa Cruise at the
Florida address, in attempted compliance with the
provision of the ticket which says you must file notice
to the carrier before filing suit. And you have to do
that within 185 days.
So we not only got the ticket from Costa
Cruise -- we bought it from Costa Cruise -- the ticket
itself, if you look at I think it's 25a of the
appendix to the petition for certiorari, there is a
prominent page which says "Costa Cruise, cruise company"
next to a picture of the vessel. So we have that.
Then when we filed the notice, we sent it to
Costa Cruise, we get a letter back from a person who
claims to be in a position to resolve the liability of
the vessel over -- owner, signed by him as claims
administrator for Costa Cruise.
Those are the things -- oh, and then we
have, prior to the commencement of suit, the
Internet investigation about which Florida company is
registered to do business in the State of Michigan, and
we look at the Costa Cruise Web site, which says: "Costa
Crociere with several offices in several countries,
United States office, Costa Cruise, Florida."
So those are some of the things which give
rise to the mistake --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bendure, can -- can I
come back to your -- I'm not sure why it matters, but it
seems to me you’re giving too narrow an interpretation,
and I would not like our opinion to read any more
narrowly than the statute allows.
It seems to me that if you assert a
different claim arising out of the same transaction, you
would be able to amend. If you will look at (c)(1)(C),
which is what you’re asserting here, right? (C)(1)(C)
says, “the amendment changes the party or the naming of
party against whom the claim is asserted, if Rule
(c)(1)(B) is satisfied.” Then you go back to (1)(B)
and it says, “the amendment asserts a claim or defense
that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence
set out.”
It doesn't say it has to be the same claim.
MR. BENDURE: There’s no question we
satisfy that. Everybody agrees.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. That's
why I don't understand why you’re arguing a more
narrow -- a more narrow interpretation.
MR. BENDURE: Because I’m forced to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you’re home
free with (B).
MR. BENDURE: Unfortunately, (C) then goes
on and says: "And if, within the period provided," (i)
and (ii). So --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, but -- but those
are the only things we -- we have to argue about.
MR. BENDURE: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There’s no doubt that you
are asserting -- even if you were asserting a different
claim, it certainly arose out of the same transaction or
event, didn't it?
MR. BENDURE: Certainly. No question about
that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.
MR. BENDURE: If the Court doesn't have any
additional questions at this time, I’d like to reserve
the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Glazier.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. GLAZIER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GLAZIER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
There are, we suggest, two issues before the
Court: The first is the legal question of whether a
plaintiff's knowledge about the identity of the proper
party can preclude a finding that there was a mistake
concerning the identity of the proper party. That, we
suggest, is in some ways the easier issue, because there
are -- there’s abundant authority from the circuit
courts of appeal and from this Court in Nelson v. Adams
USA, where the Court said the rule requires a mistake.
In that case, there was no mistake.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Glazier --
JUSTICE BREYER: It's no mistake if you
happen to know it, if you happen to know who the right
party is?
MR. GLAZIER: Correct. And --
JUSTICE BREYER: Ever?
MR. GLAZIER: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Have you ever driven a car
where your wife has said turn left and you’ve turned
right?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: Has that ever happened to
you?
MR. GLAZIER: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Was there anything you
didn't know?
MR. GLAZIER: What the facts are here, Your
Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm asking about this
question, my hypothetical.
MR. GLAZIER: You know --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: Was there anything you
didn't know?
MR. GLAZIER: There is nothing that you did
not know.
JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. Did you do it by
mistake? Yes, of course, you did. It's happened to
every human being. There are millions of instances in
which people do things by mistake where, in fact --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think your wife made a
mistake. I don't think you made a mistake.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: No, my wife does not make
mistakes.
(Laughter.)
MR. GLAZIER: I think --
JUSTICE BREYER: I make mistakes, and
sometimes I make mistakes knowing all the facts, and so
do you and so does everybody else. So I never heard of
this thing that you can't make a mistake knowing all the
facts. But anyway, here we have a person who didn't
know all the facts. What the judge says is he should
have known all the facts.
Where in the record does he say he did know
all the facts?
MR. GLAZIER: Where -- in three different
times the plaintiff was informed of the facts. But let
me say on the --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's a different matter.
My wife told me to turn left and I turned right, okay?
But I didn't take it in.
MR. GLAZIER: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: So that's a different
matter. Where does it say that he did know the facts as
opposed to he should have known the facts?
MR. GLAZIER: The circuit court refers --
talks about imputed knowledge. We disavow that. There
was no need for imputed knowledge in this case. What
imputes knowledge is someone who does not have
knowledge. Courts and lawyers make that up. If you
don't have knowledge --
JUSTICE BREYER: I just want the citations
to the page. I wasn't challenging you. I just wanted
the citations to the page --
MR. GLAZIER: There are --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- where there’s a finding
that, in fact, he knew that this company called "Costa
Cruise" in Italian is the same as the company called
"Costa Cruise" in English? I take it "Crociere" means
"cruise."
MR. GLAZIER: They are -- they're separate
corporations.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes. One is called
"Costa Cruise" in Italian and one is called "Costa
Cruise" in English. And I just want to know where it
says in the record that the client or he, the lawyer,
actually knew, actually knew that he should have sued
the one that spells its name in Italian?
MR. GLAZIER: They are separate
corporations. There’s nothing in the record that says --
JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't ask you that
question. I'm asking for a record citation as to where
there is a finding that this particular plaintiff knew
that the Italian company called "Costa Cruise" was in
fact the one he should have sued?
MR. GLAZIER: There is a finding --
JUSTICE BREYER: I’ll write them down and
look at them later.
MR. GLAZIER: The finding on page 19a of the
district court opinion says --
JUSTICE SCALIA: 19a of the petition?
MR. GLAZIER: 19a of the cert petition
says "Her failure to timely naming Costa Crociere,
S.p.A. as defendant."
JUSTICE BREYER: I thought what the district
court said was “impute” the knowledge.
MR. GLAZIER: No. No, the district court
did not impute knowledge, and this is an important
point. The circuit court imputed knowledge, and --
JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that?
Where does it say that on 19a?
MR. GLAZIER: 19a -- it's not precisely it,
but it says, "Her failure to timely named Costa Crociere
as defendant was not the result of a mistake." It does not
specifically say --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- I know. I would
say in reading this, that both courts have made the most
elementary mistake of the English language in thinking
that when a person doesn't know something but should
have known it, that that’s inconsistent with a mistake.
That's the very definition of a mistake.
MR. GLAZIER: Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, all I want is some
citation from you that shows that isn't what they
thought.
MR. GLAZIER: Well, the best I can do is the
conclusion that there is not a mistake. But I -- I need
to --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's the conclusion,
and when I read two sentences down, it said they may have
had constructive knowledge. The word "constructive" to
me, when I hear I want to run out the door, because what
the word "constructive" to me means is not knowledge.
MR. GLAZIER: I’d like to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. I -- I am not
following it. Where -- where -- where --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm on page 19a.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. But he's talking
about constructive notice --
JUSTICE BREYER: Constructive notice.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- by -- by the defendant,
not constructive knowledge by the --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then what is --
where is the page that it says that the plaintiff had actual,
as opposed to imputed, knowledge?
MR. GLAZIER: The -- there -- there is not
that sentence --
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MR. GLAZIER: -- in the opinion. What there
is, is the plaintiff made a conscious choice.
The facts of the case are, first of all,
before the lawsuit is filed the plaintiff has the
ticket. There is no doubt, no doubt whatsoever, that
the plaintiff or her attorney read --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any other than
that one page on the ticket, that against the mailing
envelopes that she got that say "Costa Cruise" -- is
there anything in the entire record other than that
definition page that includes carrier, that includes
steward, anything else that tips her off that this is a
different corporation?
MR. GLAZIER: There are three different
pieces of evidence. The first is the ticket. The
ticket defines carrier as Costa Crociere. It is the
only entity stated by name --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It says it includes
stewards. What do you -- what do you say to that?
MR. GLAZIER: I'm sorry. I didn’t --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It includes the stewards on
the boat, according to your -- your friend.
MR. GLAZIER: It lists one entity by name,
Costa Crociere, and lists others by role. Now, there
may be some dispute over whether --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't Costa
Cruise be perceived to hold one of those roles?
MR. GLAZIER: Well, one might argue that
there might be a number of different entities that might
be a carrier, but there is only one entity which is
clearly the carrier, indisputably a carrier.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the relationship
between those corporations?
MR. GLAZIER: Costa Crociere is, I believe,
one level removed an owner of Costa Cruise Lines. Costa
Crociere operates around the world. They have different
companies that operate as sales and marketing agents in
different regions.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are they -- are they
sister corporations, a parent-sub --
MR. GLAZIER: No.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- or what?
MR. GLAZIER: Costa Crociere is parent, and I
believe there’s a corporation below them, and then that
corporation owns Costa Cruise Lines.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: When it's below them, you
mean it owns all the shares in its -- in its subsidiary
company?
MR. GLAZIER: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the -- the
definition of carrier includes independent contractors.
I mean -- I -- I would -- other than that they are more
closely related, I can see someone thinking, well, Costa
Cruise is at least an independent contractor with which
Costa Crociere does business.
MR. GLAZIER: There might be more than one
carrier, but there is one carrier identified by name.
It is the first -- it is the first person listed. Costa
Crociere is the carrier. I -- I suggest that if one
reads the first page of the ticket, one might have
questions about whether there might be some other
entities that are carriers, but there is simply no doubt
that Costa Crociere is the carrier.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if you went to --
MR. GLAZIER: Now, there is no --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you went to the Web site,
which was mentioned, for Costa Cruise, there would be a tab
that says "Our ships" "Our ships" -- and one of those ships
is Costa Magica, whatever.
MR. GLAZIER: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: "Our ships," and it
identifies Costa Cruise as the cruise operator. That's
the information that's given to passengers in the United
States who are going to book on these ships. It says
Costa Cruise, our ships, Costa Cruise is the operator.
That's what was being put forth to the public.
MR. GLAZIER: What -- what -- the relationship
between the parties was governed by the ticket. The
ticket says, for example, the claim against the carrier
has to be filed within the Southern District of Florida.
This claim was filed in Southern District of Florida,
but they did not sue the carrier as identified on the
ticket. And the question is was there a mistake
concerning the identity of the proper party --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it shouldn't matter
that this confusion was caused in large part by this
entity that advertises in English under the name "Costa
Cruise" and identifies Costa Cruise as the operator.
"The largest European cruise operator" is how Costa
Cruise is -- is identified in -- in the advertising.
MR. GLAZIER: We -- we believe that the
ticket is clear, and that governs. But even if one would
disagree with that, then we move forward. If there were
any confusion, there’s an answer filed. Costa Cruise
Lines is sued. Costa Cruise Lines denies that it can be
held liable, says it wasn't the carrier, it wasn’t --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the answer is filed
conveniently after the 1-year period has run.
MR. GLAZIER: The answer is filed, but the
question of whether the defendant knew or should have
known that there -- it -- it would have been sued but
for a mistake, the inquiry there is not within the
limitations period. It was until the 1991 amendment,
which followed the Schiavone case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I don't --
I mean, there’s some sharp practice going on here.
Paragraph 10 of their complaint sues Costa Cruise Lines
because -- saying they owned, operated, managed,
supervised, and controlled the ocean-going passenger
vessel. And it's the same lawyer for Costa Cruise as
for Costa Crociere, right?
MR. GLAZIER: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So that
lawyer looks at this and says: Aha, they made a
mistake; they named the cruise line rather than the name
in Italian. So I'm going to wait until the statute of
limitations runs, and then a couple of days after, I'm
going to say aha.
MR. GLAZIER: The statute of limitations is
not the measuring period. It was before the 1991
amendment. Now, what happened here is the answer is
filed, which makes clear the defendant -- the defendant
Costa Cruise Lines denies it was involved with the
ownership, operation, or management. That's Joint
Appendix 30. Joint Appendix --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the answer say the
statute -- the 1-year period has run? Was that raised
as a defense in the answer?
MR. GLAZIER: It was not raised in the -- in
the defense -- it was not raised as defense in the
answer. It -- it was not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: When was it raised as a
defense?
MR. GLAZIER: It was raised 10 weeks later
in a motion for summary judgment, which was still within
the Rule 4(m) period, and that is the crucial period.
If upon reading the answer, which says the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- the Rule 4(m)
period concerns when you can serve. It doesn't say that
the statute of limitations is any more than what was the
term of the -- of the passage, was 1 year.
MR. GLAZIER: Well, the Rule 4(m) period is
awfully important because Rule 15(c) turns on, since
91, on the Rule(4)(m) period. If during the Rule 4(m)
service period, the -- it became clear to Costa Crociere
that it was an intended defendant, that it would have
been sued but for a mistake, then the complaint against
Costa Crociere would relate back, even though it was not
timely filed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, that -- that
assumes -- that assumes -- when, what is it, 1(C)(ii),
"knew or should have known," it says within the period
provided by rule 4(m). Now, in the early part of that
period, at -- at one point in the period you should have
known. And at another point, because the answer was
filed, you shouldn't have known.
MR. GLAZIER: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're relying on the
fact that they filed an answer which -- I'm sorry --
that -- that you filed an answer which made it very
clear to them what the situation was. But was there any
point, any -- and all it takes I think is any point
within that 4(m) period -- when you -- you knew or should
have known?
MR. GLAZIER: The answer, we submit, is no.
When they filed the complaint, the complaint indicated a
couple of things. First of all, they were suing Costa
Cruise Lines, but they had read -- the complaint made
clear that they had read the ticket. They specifically
relied on the venue provision of the ticket. So we knew
that they had read the ticket, which clearly identifies
Costa Crociere as being the carrier, yet they still --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is the
defense -- I mean, the ticket says suit must be filed
within 1 year of the date of any alleged injury. And
where is the -- that defense stated? You said it comes
up 10 weeks --
MR. GLAZIER: In the motion for summary
judgment, which -- which is not in the joint appendix.
It's docket entry 19. The affidavit which is -- was
filed with the motion for summary judgment is in the --
the Joint Appendix at Joint Appendix 33. And the
motion -- the answer made clear that Costa Crociere is
the carrier which could be liable, not Costa Cruise
Lines --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --
MR. GLAZIER: -- but there was no change.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- being realistic
about it, as I understand it you're relying entirely on
the condition, general conditions of passage in the
ticket, the fine print describing the term "carrier."
That's -- but do you take into account that
the cover of the ticket, which is what the passenger
would look at, uses "Costa Cruises," blah, blah, blah --
"Costa Cruise Lines" and so -- and doesn't even mention
the carrier?
MR. GLAZIER: The --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Don't you think, looking
at that ticket, if you were a passenger you would think
you were doing business with Costa Cruise?
MR. GLAZIER: Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Just looking at the cover?
MR. GLAZIER: If what --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct that on the
cover of the ticket, the Italian name isn't used at all?
MR. GLAZIER: On the cover, the Italian name
is not used. The ticketing agent's name --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't that what the --
MR. GLAZIER: -- is Costa Cruise Lines.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- what the passenger would
normally look at, understand who he is doing business with?
MR. GLAZIER: If one were to not read the
ticket, which on page 1 --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Assuming -- assuming the
lawyer would just look at the cover before he files a
lawsuit?
MR. GLAZIER: We know -- if this were a
question of uncertainty whether the lawyer read the
ticket, that would be one thing, but we know that the
lawyer read the ticket.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't understand
what the lawyer reading the ticket has to do with this
question.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Because the question is
whether the lawyer made a mistake. Isn't that the
question?
MR. GLAZIER: Well --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And he did make a mistake.
MR. GLAZIER: The principle is if one knows
what the true facts are -- if one knows what the true
facts are and proceeds in any event, then there’s no
mistake concerning the --
JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't true, is it? In
the English language, it's not true? I mean, that's why
I was giving you some examples. I don't know; maybe
there’s some special legal language somewhere written
in Blackstone, or maybe it's Lord Coke, I don't know,
that says when you use the word "mistake" don't use it
in English, use -- use it in Italian.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: But I mean, if we're going
to use it in English, there -- it's not hard to find
instances where a person would know, but he'd still make
a mistake.
MR. GLAZIER: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: And there's even a
fortiori --
MR. GLAZIER: Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- if he doesn't know, even
if he should.
MR. GLAZIER: We have --
JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that true?
MR. GLAZIER: What we have up front is
the -- the ticket. If we move past that, it's sort of a
test case. All right, did this plaintiff really not --
JUSTICE BREYER: What possible reason is
there that somebody who is hurt on a ship and has a
lawyer, and she has a broken leg, and she'd like to get
recovery, would deliberately sue the wrong person?
MR. GLAZIER: The plaintiff --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there such a reason?
MR. GLAZIER: The evidence in the record is
that the plaintiff's lawyer looked at the Web site and
chose a United States corporation instead of --
JUSTICE BREYER: And I’m just saying, did he
do it by mistake? If you were representing this person,
would you want to sue the company that could give you
some money if they are liable? Or would you rather sue
the Bank of America that has nothing to do with it?
(Laughter.)
MR. GLAZIER: Well, if it were -- if I had
to sue Costa Crociere through the Hague Convention in
Genoa, maybe a lawyer --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I want to ask you
about that, because in your brief you refer in your
footnote on page 6 to requirements of the Federal
Government 44101-44103. So I looked those up. I
discovered that 44103 says that it is a requirement, and
you say you follow these requirements, that you shall
establish under regulations of the FMC financial
responsibility.
And those regulations tell you that, at
least as best I could read them, that you must furnish a
written designation of a person in the United States as
a legal agent for service of process, and they are
referring to instances in which somebody on a ship
suffered an accident.
So since you say that you are complying with
that, I would like to know the name and address of that
person in the United States for whom you must send legal
process, because if obviously that had been on the
ticket, that is precisely the man to whom this plaintiff
would have sent the notice.
MR. GLAZIER: I cannot answer the question
now.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well then, were you correct
when you said in your -- in your brief that this company
which you represent does comply with 44103?
MR. GLAZIER: My understanding is the answer
is yes, but I cannot address the specific question.
I submit --
JUSTICE BREYER: It is relevant, I think,
because it adds to the confusion if they are under a
legal requirement to have a service -- an agent to
receive service, and then they not only don't do it, but
they don't have it printed on the ticket. And they get
everybody mixed up by having the same name in English,
or a very similar one, and announcing someone you’re
supposed to serve, and then it turns out to be not that
person you’re supposed to serve. It's a mysterious
person that you can't find.
MR. GLAZIER: But the question, though --
JUSTICE BREYER: It seems odd. I’d like
to know what the explanation is of this.
MR. GLAZIER: Well, the question is not a
more generalized blame explanation, but under the rule,
the language of the rule, whether Costa Crociere knew or
should have known that the action would have been
brought against it but for a mistake concerning the
proper party's identity.
And the most problematic case -- part of the
case for the plaintiff is why, when they were told in
the answer that they had not sued the proper party, that
Costa Cruise Lines was not the carrier, was not the
operator, but Costa Crociere is, why did the plaintiff
not do anything?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we -- let's clarify
that point now. I am looking at 3a, which is the court
of appeals opinion, and it says that "Costa Crociere
moved to dismiss, arguing that it had been sued after
the 1-year ticket period allowed for claims set
forth" -- as set forth in the ticket. Then the rule
tells us that you have this much time to serve, and
then the complaint will -- the -- the amendment will
relate back to the date of the original filing.
It doesn't change your statement, your
defense. The 1-year statute of limitations isn't
affected. What is affected is the complaint will
relate back if there’s an amendment filed. But the
-year statute of limitations remains, and you didn't
bother to answer until the -- that time had run.
MR. GLAZIER: But if -- if, during the
0-day period -- you know, the Rule 15(c) happens to
rely upon the measuring point, but service is not the crucial
point. Within that 120-day period, if the plaintiff had
done anything, anything at all, to indicate that she had
not sued Costa Crociere because of a mistake, then the
complaint would have related back, a very easy case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the relation
back is different from the point at which the statute
has run. The statute runs after 1 year. Then, if she
does what the rules say, it can relate back to the date
of the original filing. The fact remains that you
didn't file your answer until after the limitation
period had run.
MR. GLAZIER: Yes. Yes, we did not file the
answer. They filed the lawsuit on the eve of the --
JUSTICE ALITO: Why does that even matter?
I'm not really sure I'm following this argument. Let's
say that the answer was filed during the limitations
period, and the lawyer -- the plaintiff's lawyer is a
solo practitioner, and he or she is out of the office
because the lawyer's on a cruise --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO: -- and doesn't come back
for 2 weeks. And by that time, the limitations period
has run. It's still a mistake.
MR. GLAZIER: If --
JUSTICE ALITO: Where do you see in --
the question on which cert was granted has to do with
imputed knowledge. Where do you see in the text of this
rule anything that picks up the concept of either imputed
knowledge or actual knowledge? It just talks about a mistake.
MR. GLAZIER: We do not rely at all upon
imputed knowledge. The Court granted review, but we
don't think there is imputed knowledge here.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, where -- just -- where do
you -- where in the rule is there anything that relates to the
reasonableness of the mistake? What if it is the most
foolish, negligent mistake you can possibly imagine? Is
it not still a mistake?
MR. GLAZIER: The rule contemplates by its
structure that the mistake will be the cause of the
reason why the -- the plaintiff did not sue the parties.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That’s not what the
rule says. That’s not what the rule says. The rule
doesn't talk about what kind of mistake or why. The
rule says what the defendant should have known. And so,
when you read this complaint, it's very clear you know
you’re the carrier.
MR. GLAZIER: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You know cruise -- the
other line, the sales agent, can't be the carrier,
correct?
MR. GLAZIER: We --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's either a factual
or a legal mistake. There is no other way to read that
other than that there is a mistake.
MR. GLAZIER: And then --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because -- then have you
to answer Justice Breyer's question, which is: What
conceivable reason that is not either negligence or
unintentional or inadvertent or just plain stupidity,
however you want to define it, that someone who is
injured would want to name a party who wasn't
responsible for the injury?
MR. GLAZIER: The most powerful evidence is
simply when they were informed of the claimed mistake,
they did nothing for 95 days to indicate in any manner
whatsoever that it was a mistake. They had --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's evidence from
which the absence of a mistake might be inferred. I
agree with that, but that doesn't establish that it
wasn't -- it wasn't a mistake.
MR. GLAZIER: Well, this -- whether
something is a mistake ultimately is a factual issue.
There’s a legal question of whether a plaintiff's
knowledge of the identity of a proper party can preclude
a finding of mistake. But once we get past that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But, counsel, don't --
what you’re really talking about is whether once the
answer was filed, they were dilatory in making their
motion. I don't understand how you can argue that the
day you received this complaint, you didn't understand
that some sort of mistake had been made.
The day that the answer came in, you might
start to have a doubt because of their delay in the
motion to amend, but doesn't that go to a 15(a)
question, whether the judge should have given leave to
amend because of dilatory tactics? Isn't that a 15(a)
question, not a 15(c) question?
MR. GLAZIER: Well, delay in moving to amend
via 15(a). But 15(c) requires the judge to determine
whether there was a mistake. And here, in essence, we
have a test case: Well, the plaintiff is claiming that
the reason why she did not sue Costa Crociere --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there anything in the
face of the complaint that would suggest anything but a
mistake? Now, forget -- I'm being very specific. On
the face of the complaint. You read that.
MR. GLAZIER: Yes, I believe there is. The
complaint specifically makes clear that the plaintiff's
lawyer read the ticket.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where does it say that?
Where does it say: "I know that the carrier is Costa
Crociere"? Where does it say that?
MR. GLAZIER: The complaint certainly does
not say that. What --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What the complaint says
is that Costa Cruise, the operator of the vessel,
injured me, correct?
MR. GLAZIER: It says that the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And is that an accurate
statement of fact?
MR. GLAZIER: That -- it's not an accurate
statement of fact.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I would have
said the previous paragraph, 9, says: "The plaintiff
has complied with all the pre-suit requirements of the
passenger ticket." So you know they read the ticket.
MR. GLAZIER: Right. And in the paragraph
before, venue is proper in Broward County; defendant's
passenger ticket contains a forum selection. So we know
when Costa -- Costa Cruise Lines, or Costa
Crociere learns of this, we know that the plaintiff
decided --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, which is it?
Is that a Freudian slip?
(Laughter.)
MR. GLAZIER: No. No, because we’re --
because we’re not disputing --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just a mistake.
(Laughter.)
MR. GLAZIER: We’re not -- we are not
disputing the notice issue. What -- what is clear is
they have read the ticket, and despite that --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Despite that, they made a
mistake.
MR. GLAZIER: -- they have decided to sue
Costa Cruise Lines.
JUSTICE STEVENS: They made a mistake,
right? They read the ticket, and despite that, they
made a mistake.
MR. GLAZIER: No.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What?
MR. GLAZIER: We don't think so.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't -- why doesn't
the rule cover it?
MR. GLAZIER: But, again, if we move past --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I object to your relying
upon the -- the answer as -- as establishing compliance
with (C)(ii), because (C), in the prologue, says "is
satisfied, if within the period provided by Rule 4(m)."
And there is at least some point within that
period before the answer was filed. And if, within that
period before the answer, you knew or should have known
that it was a mistake, it seems to me you lose.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
MR. GLAZIER: I understand what you’re
saying, but there’s nothing in -- just the point --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And the -- the only
thing you could rely on for that short period before the
answer is filed is simply the ticket, right?
MR. GLAZIER: There’s nothing in the rule --
the ticket and the complaint -- there’s nothing in the
rule that says that only events up to point of the
running of the limitations period or the service of the
answer are relevant. It is throughout the certain --
within the period --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are reading
"within the period" to mean "throughout the period." It
doesn't say “throughout the period.” It says “if within
the period.”
MR. GLAZIER: Well, the district court,
which is serving as the fact-finder there, looked at all
the evidence. And the powerful evidence is the service
of the answer, which identifies the party --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's an important
issue with respect to the statute. I don't think we can
treat cavalierly whether "within the period" means
"throughout the period." That's one of the issues here.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one -- one question
about the face of the ticket, the one with the picture
on it. Is it Costa Cruise or Costa Crociere that got
this big award for “B.E.S.T. 4”?
MR. GLAZIER: I -- I don't know the answer
to that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Pardon me.
MR. GLAZIER: I don't know the answer at
this time.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I make the assumption that
it's the cruise line, Crociere, that got the award. So
the ticket itself confuses the two companies.
Is that a mistake, incidentally?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I am right, is that a mistake?
MR. GLAZIER: I -- Your Honor -- clearly, as
you said, Costa Crociere is the vessel operator. The
ticket makes it clear on the next page, the very next
page --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: How many -- if you have a
,000-page ticket, how many pages do you have to read?
MR. GLAZIER: Here, you only have to read
one.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But this is the first one.
MR. GLAZIER: Well, this is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The one I pointed out to
you with the mistake, that’s the first one.
MR. GLAZIER: It’s -- it’s on the cover.
The ticketing agent here, Costa Cruise Lines, adds the
cover. The first page of the provisions say Costa
Crociere is the -- is the vessel operator.
But, again, if one looks at the answer,
there’s no response. No response, and then a motion for
summary judgment. Still nothing. If the plaintiff had
merely said in an e-mail or a phone call, hey, I made a
mistake, then it would be clear. An easy case. But
they did not act despite being informed. Despite being
informed in the answer of the identity of the proper
party and in the motion for summary judgment. The trial
court, serving as the trier of fact here on this issue,
had to make that decision. Maybe the court with another --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm still puzzled, because
Rule (C) just requires -- describes the state of mind of
the defendant, correct? C(i) and (ii); isn't that
right?
MR. GLAZIER: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it not true that
under (i), the defendant did receive such notice of the
action, would not be prejudiced? That's clear, isn't it?
MR. GLAZIER: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it also true that
at the time they received the complaint, they knew or
should have known that the action would have been
brought against the carrier instead of the broker?
MR. GLAZIER: The answer --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I just don't understand
how you get around the plain language.
MR. GLAZIER: Our answer is no, and
especially considering, within the events, they don’t
show that there’s --
JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't think -- you
don't think that the agent didn't realize that they
would have sued the carrier if they had known the
identity of the right party?
MR. GLAZIER: What is known is that they had
the ticket. They still decided --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand all that.
MR. GLAZIER: -- to sue Costa Cruise Lines --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But we're talking about the
-- about mindset of the defendant, and to say that they
wouldn't have sued -- they would have sued the broker
instead of this carrier? It's absurd.
MR. GLAZIER: Well, the events played a role and
demonstrated that even after the plaintiff was informed
of the identity of the proper party, they continued to
pursue the claim against the ticketing agent.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Bendure, you have 9 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. BENDURE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BENDURE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Obviously, from the questions, the Court has
a good grasp of the facts and the issues in our
arguments. I’d just like to clarify a couple of
factual points.
The district court ruling didn't rely on the
ticket at all. What the district court said was: I
adopt the legal premise that if you knew before the
filing of -- before the running of the statute of
limitations but didn't sue, that would not be a
mistake. And here, says the district court judge, they
filed their answer after the statute of limitations, and
that's why you lose under a rule that requires that
notice before the statute of limitations expires. That
was the district court rationale.
The circuit court was the one who relied
upon the imputed knowledge notion that is now, I think,
disavowed by Respondent himself.
With regard to the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This is sort of an
equitable rule, isn't it, this mistake? We're going to,
you know -- equity takes account of such things. It
seems to me very reasonable to say: If the mistake is
egregious, it doesn't apply.
MR. BENDURE: I think now one gets into a
wonderful process of trying to identify mistakes on a
scale of egregiousness. Like, how many points of
egregiousness would it take? And I think that's beyond
the statute, or the court rule itself, which just uses
the plain language "mistake."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought
your answer would have been: This has nothing to do
with equity at all. It's just the interpretation of a
legal rule.
MR. BENDURE: Certainly. And the rule
itself -- I understood Justice Scalia's point to be that
the interpretation of the rule is designed to be liberal
in its application to avoid the forfeiture of
potentially meritorious causes of action over technical
mistakes which have nothing to do with the merits. I
thought that was the sense in which you used the word
"equitable."
The other point I’d like to make, even
though it's, in my view, legally insignificant, is their
argument regarding the nature of the delay. Their
motion for summary judgment was filed on May 6th. Two
days later, the court erroneously dismissed the lawsuit
for a period of approximately a month. It was then
reinstated on June 5th, and our response, which sought
relation back, was filed on June 13th.
So in addition to the scheduling order,
there is a 1-month period of time in which the case was
erroneously dismissed. So if it were significant, we
could say there’s not significant delay. But the
ultimate point is it's legally beside the point.
If the Court has no further questions,
I'll --
JUSTICE BREYER: This might be tangential,
but is there a reason to suggest the Federal Maritime
Commission look into this? Because I read the regs. I
don't understand quite what's going on, because it seems
to me they have a rule that is designed to prevent this
situation.
MR. BENDURE: It may well --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that true, what I'm suggesting
or not? You know the area better.
MR. BENDURE: I don't know. I'm not a
maritime lawyer, Your Honor. But I think certainly if
the Court's opinion were to note it, the Maritime
Commission might well take a hint from the opinion and
look into it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. BENDURE: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the
