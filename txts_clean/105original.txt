CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
now in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado.
Mr. Draper.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. DRAPER
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. DRAPER: Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and
may it please the Court:
Kansas would like to address three issues today.
50 years of success of the Court's river master
on the Delaware River and 16 years of success of the
Court's river master on the Pecos River demonstrate the
wisdom of appointing a river master under appropriate
circumstances on a river like the Arkansas River, which is
the subject of this case.
Secondly, the Court should affirm the neutral
principle that prejudgment interest accrues on all damages
owing at the time interest begins to run.
And third, a 1-year compliance period would be
consistent with the Court's prior rulings in this case and
would preserve an essential right of Kansas and its
farmers under this -- this compact that would otherwise be
lost under the master's recommendation of a 10-year
accounting period.
With respect to this accounting period, I would
note that in both prior opinions in this case, this Court
has relied on the annual results of the Hydrologic-
Institutional Model, which is the standard for compact
compliance in this case.
In the first opinion in 1995, this Court
distinguished between monthly and -- and seasonal use of
the model, deciding that monthly use was too frequent, but
that seasonal reliance on the model for determining
useability under article IV-D of the compact was
reasonable.
When the case was back here in 2001, this Court
reviewed the calculation of damages, which was done on a
yearly basis. As you can imagine, the factors that go
into calculation of damages vary from year to year, and so
it is crucial whether the depletions calculated by the H-
I Model, as it's called, are accurate, sufficiently
accurate, and reasonable to rely upon on an annual basis.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Draper, correct me if I'm
wrong. I -- I looked at these papers a while ago. I
thought they did it on a 10-year basis and they just moved
it up each year, using a different 10 years to calculate
the -- the relevant amounts in the 10th year.
MR. DRAPER: That is correct, Your Honor. It is
a moving accumulation of 10 years of results.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So they do use 10 years of
figures to determine what the relevant year's water would
be.
MR. DRAPER: That's correct, Your Honor. In
other words, the -- the annual determination includes the
most current year for which there is data and the previous
9 years, adds all those up, nets out the pluses and
minuses, and that determines whether in the year in
question there is compliance with the compact.
JUSTICE SCALIA: This will begin in 2007, as I
recall. Is that --
MR. DRAPER: That is the special master's
proposal, yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:
even -- even if we agree with you that it should be done
annually, why -- why wouldn't you propose that it be done
annually using the previous 7 years' experience that we
now have and then, you know, ultimately by 2007, we can
use the previous 10 years? I -- I don't understand why we
have to do it year by year and forego even 7 years'
benefit of -- of this methodology.
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I couldn't agree with
you more in the sense that we should begin now with the
accounting so that you look each year at the results of
this standard, which has been approved by the Court, for
And what I don't understand is
compact compliance in that year only, and if -- if you
accumulate it --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No. That -- that's -- I said
just the opposite. I said I -- I don't know why we should
begin looking for this -- at this year only using this
methodology. Why shouldn't we average this methodology
over the previous 7 years?
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, averages will tend to
smooth out the results and will hide the effects during
dry years, which is when the farmers in Kansas, who are
the beneficiaries that Kansas intended to benefit -- and
both parties realize that. They need this water --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your method -- your
method will over-emphasize the dry years. So either way
you have a -- a imperfect situation. In your case, year
by year, and in a dry year, Colorado perhaps must over-
compensate, and if you have, say, 3 dry years in a row,
then it's going to be -- work out to Colorado's
disadvantage.
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I believe the -- the
result is the -- is the opposite. If I may explain.
The model, the -- the Hydrologic-Institutional
Model, has been made as unbiased as possible. The one
aspect in which we have identified a bias is that it
favors Colorado during dry years. It tends to
underestimate the depletions that would have to be
replaced by Colorado.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the method that you're
attacking, but if you were to do it year by year, wouldn't
it be just the reverse?
MR. DRAPER: We don't believe that aspect of the
model would be any different if we're doing it year by
year. We'd simply be taking the results that are
calculated each year under either approach and use those
in that year so that if you have a dry year, you are --
are calculating in that year whether there is compliance
and staying as close as possible to the true intent of the
compact, which is to provide water when the farmers need
it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you -- do you dispute what
-- what the master found here, that the methodology is
more accurate on a 10-year average than it is year by
year?
MR. DRAPER: No, Your Honor. The longer the
period of time you take, the more the accumulated results
of the model will match the measured --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The actual year-by-year
results. Right?
MR. DRAPER: Yes, and I should point out that
it's impossible to know what the right answer is. You can
-- you can measure the flows and the diversions in the
river and compare that to one of the runs of this model,
but it's the difference between the two runs, one
representing the compact condition, which is supposed to
be met, and the other representing the situation with the
wells operating. And it's the difference between those
two whose accuracy is in question.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I -- I --
MR. DRAPER: And no one knows what that is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that -- that the
master concluded that even as to a particular year, the
model will be more accurate if you use the average from
the previous 10 years than if you just applied the model
to a single year, that even as to the real results for
that single year, the model will be more accurate if you
use a 10-year average.
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I don't understand it
that way. If you use 10 years, you are adding to the most
recent year results 9 years of pluses and minuses that's
going to, in most case, mask what happened during that
next previous year. You will be looking at a 10-year
accumulation of ups and downs and not analyzing what
happened in -- in the year in question.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part or all of the
objectives of both the -- the decree and the 10-year model
to conserve subsurface reservoirs?
MR. DRAPER: Not -- not directly, Your Honor.
It -- it does preserve that reservoir in fact because
depletion of that reservoir affects the stream flows, and
it's the stream flows that are compacted here and that
have up to now --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then -- well, then why
isn't -- if -- if that's so, why isn't it that Colorado
shouldn't get credit for the wet years in -- in -- on an
average? You're concerned about the dry years. It seems
to me that Colorado should be given some credit for the
wet years when the subterranean reservoirs are -- are
replenished. Or am I wrong -- am I wrong about that?
MR. DRAPER: I think in general, Your Honor, you
are -- are correct. The question about there are over-
deliveries by Colorado, I believe is what you're
addressing, is there -- is there a way to give Colorado
credit for that. And there is a way. There is a -- a --
an account in John Martin Reservoir, which is 60 miles
above the State line, for those deliveries. When they are
delivered there, if there is more delivered than is
actually needed in that year to achieve compact
compliance, that can be retained there and, except for a
small effect of evaporation, is available to offset
depletions in the following year.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I thought that the compact
specifically provided there shall be no allowance or
accumulation of credits or debits for or against either
State.
MR. DRAPER: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how does that comport
with what you just said?
MR. DRAPER: Under those circumstances, the
water that would be delivered to this offset account in
John Martin Reservoir is not a credit that's accounted
under the compact for that year. So it would not enter
into the compact accounting for that year. It would not
constitute a -- a credit, but it would be available as a
practical matter to be used as a credit in the next year
for current depletions. So there would be no carryover in
compact accounting.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't -- I don't understand
that statement. You say it would be available to be used
as a credit in a subsequent year. Do you really mean it
would be used as a credit, or do you mean it would simply
be there to be used?
MR. DRAPER: I think your formulation, Your
Honor, is -- is more correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. DRAPER: It would be there to be used, and
it would not be a credit for accounting purposes. Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it's not a credit for
accounting purposes, then they're going to owe you just as
much the next year even though -- even though you had more
water the previous year.
MR. DRAPER: This is under the assumption, Your
Honor, that they have already met their obligations in the
current year.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MR. DRAPER: And it will be available as a
practical matter to meet their obligations in a subsequent
year and be accounted in that subsequent year.
I would point out that this is very important
it is supposed to be delivered under the compact. If
water is -- is not delivered, as required, in one year, it
cannot be recouped in a following year, certainly not 10
years later, as would be possible under the special
master --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then why are you using a
10-year model at all?
MR. DRAPER: It's not a 10 --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me what you're --
what you're saying is forget the 10 years. Just do it
every year.
for Kansas farmers that the -- the water be received when
MR. DRAPER: That's what we are saying, Your
Honor. And the model is inherently a yearly model. It
calculates actually results on a monthly basis, and we
have used it -- and the Court has relied upon it -- on a
yearly basis up to now.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you do it on a
monthly basis? Indeed, why don't you do it on a daily
basis? I mean, the master found that this model really
works if you -- if you stretch it out over 10 years. You
say 1 year. Why don't you do it month by month?
MR. DRAPER: Well, it -- it could be done that
way, and in fact, Your Honor, Colorado uses parts of this
same model in its own administration of groundwater
pumping, the same groundwater pumping for purposes of
protecting Colorado surface water users, and it requires
replacement of water on a monthly basis. So it is -- it
is possible.
But we believe with the yearly accumulation that
-- that we have relied upon so far in this case and that
the Court has relied upon specifically for damages, that
that is an appropriate accounting period for this
particular purpose. And that is -- that is our proposal.
The proposal of Colorado is no, let's wait 10 years before
-- and -- and accumulate it with the other 9 years before
we require any replacement.
I would point out that the H-I Model, the
Hydrologic-Institutional Model, is the best tool available
for this purpose. It was endorsed by Colorado after the
Court's first opinion in this case when it -- the Court
approved using the model on a seasonal basis for the
seasonal accounting of useability. At that time, Colorado
gave up its own model in favor of the Hydrologic-
Institutional Model, and as you can see from the master's
report, there have been several significant improvements
in the model since that time.
I would also point out the correspondence -- the
close correspondence that exists between this case and the
Pecos River litigation in the 1980's. There you had a
compact that like this compact did not specify any
specific quantity of water in the compact itself, but
indicated that there was to be no depletions beyond the
depletions that were occurring at the time of the compact
with a few small amendments that I could -- I could
mention.
But the basic similarity of the compacts is that
the status quo at the time of the compact was maintained.
There was an inflow/outflow relationship that needed to be
observed and was required to be observed by the compact.
It was expressed explicitly in the Pecos River compact by
a reference to an inflow/outflow method. In this case, it
was expressed implicitly in article IV-D of the compact.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The master found that
the role of the river master in the Pecos case was quite
different than the role of the river master you want to
have appointed here. He found that the role of the river
master in the Pecos cases was really ministerial.
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, we do not agree with
that.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You don't agree with
what?
MR. DRAPER: With the description of the Pecos
River master as being -- as having only ministerial
duties, and I can explain why.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
MR. DRAPER: Yes. if -- if you refer to the
appendix of our -- our blue brief, on page A-22, you will
see that the opening section of the Pecos River master's
manual sets out the inflow/outflow relationship that is to
be observed in complying with that compact. This is the
form of an equation. You can see y equals and a -- and a
number there.
In -- in our case, we have the -- the
Hydrologic-Institutional Model, which benefits from
several decades of increased sophistication in hydrologic
analysis to do the same job.
Please do.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The Pecos master can
simply apply this formula, can he not, and get the results
that the compact requires?
MR. DRAPER: He -- he is to apply the formula,
Your Honor, but there's a great deal of judgment,
professional, expert judgment that needs to be exercised
in order to apply it. For example, you have to separate
flood flows from base flows. When you look at the -- at
the results of a -- of a gauge on a river, you can see how
much water was in the river at particular times, but this
has to be separated into two different kinds of flows that
are treated differently under this compact.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, one of the
an engineer. He's not a lawyer.
MR. DRAPER: That's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: He's also the cheapest
master we've ever had.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But it seems to me
that the master you want appointed has got to be a lawyer
and make legal decisions.
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I don't believe so. I
think our master would be just as cheap.
(Laughter.)
reasons I'm curious is that I believe the Pecos master is
JUSTICE SOUTER: What's the difference --
JUSTICE BREYER: No. The question was what
about the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what relation do you
or -- yes -- working relation do you anticipate, if -- if
the river master is appointed, between the river master
and the commission? Does he go first to the commission
and try to get agreement or --
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, no, he would not
formally interact with the commission, just as the Pecos
River master does not formally interact with the Pecos
River commission.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what can -- what can the
authority can't do? I -- is the difference between the
two of them -- call it a jurisdictional difference -- nil,
but there is process difference in the sense that the
river master could say do this or don't do that, whereas
your -- your fear is that the authority is simply going to
be deadlocked because everything has to be done
unanimously? Is it a process difference?
MR. DRAPER: It is a process difference, Your
Honor. The --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But for that, you wouldn't be
asking for a river master then.
river master do that the -- that the commission or
MR. DRAPER: Well, if there were an
authoritative way, such as a river master, by which the
annual recurring exercise of judgment could be
accomplished, we would not need the river master. But I
don't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But aren't you bypassing what
Congress set up? You have this interstate compact and
this commission, which you're saying, well, it's
ineffective because it has to -- there are three from each
State and it has to do everything unanimously. But what
about the commission's authority to call in an -- an
arbitrator when they are deadlocked?
MR. DRAPER: That decision also requires
unanimity, Your Honor, and in the one case I'm aware of,
Kansas' suggestion of doing an arbitration was rejected by
Colorado. It's -- but it's -- it takes unanimity to do
anything under that compact administration, including the
arbitration option.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're saying Congress --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Draper, could I ask you
what is a matter of procedure? What is your understanding
of -- of how one would go about challenging the river
master's decision if one disagreed with it? Do you go to
the special master? Do you come direct to this Court?
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, we have suggested that
it be set up just as you have set up the Pecos River
master. In other words, if there were an objection to the
determination, the yearly determination, of the river
master, it would be reviewable by this Court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Directly.
MR. DRAPER: Directly.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the special master would
be out. The special master would be out of the picture,
as you describe it. You -- the special master would be
finished. The river master would take over.
Has there ever been -- has this Court ever
appointed a river master when the special master did not
recommend it? And as I understand both Delaware and the
Pecos River case, the special master recommended the
appointment of a river master.
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I believe in both of
those cases, the -- the special master was recommending
the appointment of a river master, but I would point out
that in setting out the criteria for appointing a river
master, the Court did not refer to that factor as -- as
being part of the consideration.
JUSTICE SCALIA: As I understand the system you
propose, the river master's decision would be appealable
to us, and we would review it de novo. Is that right?
MR. DRAPER: We're suggesting the same scope of
review as on the Pecos, which is clearly erroneous. This,
however, is something that the Court could decide to do
differently than the Pecos, but the clearly erroneous
standard comports with the -- the way master
recommendations are handled in the district court under
rule 53.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm very loathe to deprive
either of the States of their -- their right to have this
Court decide matters between them.
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, this would not deprive
either State of that right. And in fact --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it would if they can only
come here and -- and overturn the river master if he's
clearly erroneous. That's a -- that's a very high
standard.
MR. DRAPER: Well, there -- as I say, the Court
-- the Court may set the review threshold as it sees fit.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I had thought that your
proposal was de novo review. This is -- this is new to
me, that -- that you want it clearly erroneous.
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I would -- I would say
that we have -- we have mentioned the clearly erroneous
review standard because it was in the Pecos framework. It
is not essential to our proposal. A de novo review would
be perfectly fine with the State of Kansas.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the commission decided
to appoint an arbitrator. Would the special -- pardon me.
Would the river master then proceed independently and we'd
have two different recommendations?
MR. DRAPER: As under the Pecos, Your Honor, if
the -- if the compact administration, as it's called in
the -- in the Arkansas Basin, is able to come to a
resolution of an issue, then that would -- that would take
care of that issue. It would be -- not be necessary to
have the river master address that, and it would be an
agreement of the States because it would either be an
agreement because they had literally agreed before the --
or in the form of the Arkansas River Compact
Administration or that they had agreed to binding
arbitration and had settled it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then it would seem to
me, procedurally at least, the river master would have if
not the legal, at least the practical obligation to refer
things first to the commission.
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, the referral of matters
to the commission is why we're here in the first place.
It cannot act without unanimity. The State of Colorado,
the State in possession of this resource, can veto each
and every action of the compact administration.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That was the deal.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Your -- yes. Your State agreed
to it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That was the deal they came to.
Why should we kick it over? They came to that
arrangement, and it was approved by Congress, and now you
come back and tell us, oh, this is too cumbersome. You
should -- you should appoint this river master to do an
end run around it. I -- I -- it doesn't seem to me to be
fair.
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I don't believe that
this is an end run any more than the enforcement of the
compact is an end run around the administrative body that
is set up in many of these compacts. Those are keep-in-
touch type bodies. If they can agree on things, they are
very useful, and the Arkansas River Compact Administration
has been useful in areas where there can be agreement.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you -- you agree that
this is the -- the authority here is more than a keep-in-
touch group. Your problem with it is -- is not that you
need something more than keep in touch, but that when you
ask them to do something more than keep in touch, the
other State has a veto. And -- and that simply gets you
to Justice Scalia's objection. That's the deal you made.
MR. DRAPER: That is the -- that is the nub of
our argument against reliance on the Arkansas River
Compact Administration, that you can't look at it to
settle differences about the implementation of this
Court's decree.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did the special --
MR. DRAPER: That is a --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did the special master
mean when he said he recognized the unanimous vote
problem, but he said, but the climate may be changing?
The compact administration under the chairmanship of the
United States representative may again be seen as the best
way to administer their compact and settle issues. What
was he talking about?
MR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I think he was talking
about the hope that he has that the States could work more
cooperatively now, despite the fact that it was on this
river between these two States that this Court was first
asked to resolve interstate river disputes between States
in 1901, and we are here today still in dispute over this
river.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So there was nothing tangible
behind his --
MR. DRAPER: Nothing tangible, Your Honor.
We -- perhaps he was thinking of the settlement
that we have achieved on the Republican River. That case
started, was accepted by this Court. After rulings by
this Court, it became possible to settle that case. It
has now been settled. And the States involved in that
litigation were Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado. It was
possible in that -- in that context. It has proven
impossible in this context.
And we can expect disputes to go on, as they
have over the last century, if we do not have an impartial
expert authority to resolve disputes between States that
are going to come up every year. Every year there are
questions. How do you take the data this year and put it
into the H-I Model? While many of those issues have been
settled, because different forms of replacement and other
different circumstances arise, you have those every year.
And if you follow the lead that the Pecos River
cases of this Court give us, there is also the possibility
to address the improvement of the tool for implementing
the agreement of the States, and that is improving the
Hydrologic-Institutional Model on occasion, as we have
seen the master do over the course of this litigation.
That is allowed under the Pecos River Decree, and we
submit that it should be allowed under this decree as
well. And that is when the master would be exercising the
most judgment in our opinion.
I would conclude by saying that a -- a river
master is needed on the Arkansas to deal impartially and
expertly with annual questions that must be resolved to
implement the H-I Model, and that a 1-year compliance
period will implement the intentions of the drafters of
the compact and the needs of Kansas farmers and is
consistent with the yearly reliance that this Court has
already placed on the H-I Model.
I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal if
there are no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Draper.
Mr. Robbins, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. ROBBINS
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. ROBBINS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I think I will begin by discussing the river
master since that's where Mr. Draper left off.
I want to make it clear, first of all, that I
disagree with the assertion that the Pecos River Compact
and the Arkansas River Compact are similar in the way they
operate. The Pecos River Compact did, in fact,
specifically state that it was -- it intended to hold the
level of -- of depletion of the system by man's
development to the 1947 condition. The Arkansas River
Compact, to the contrary, begins the -- the limitation
clause by saying it is not intended to impede or prevent
future beneficial development of the Arkansas Basin,
provided that the waters of the Arkansas River are not
materially depleted in useable quantity for existing use
for the uses. So the -- the Arkansas compact contemplated
that there would be a -- a more flexible effort at using
the water of the river by water users in both States,
protecting the existing uses in both States from that
future development.
Now, this -- this Court has appointed a river
master in two circumstances. In both circumstances, as
pointed out by Justice Ginsburg, the -- the special master
recommended that because of the specific circumstances of
the case, that in fact a river master was appropriate.
That was on the Delaware River and the Pecos River. In
all other cases that deal with this issue where requests
have been made by -- by States without river -- without a
special master's recommendation, the Court has declined to
appoint a river master. There's a very good reason, I
think, behind that.
Colorado alone is the party denying interstate
compacts in two equitable apportionment decrees. If every
time a State is dissatisfied with its neighbor, is
dissatisfied with how a compact operates, it is able to
come to this Court and say, please appoint a river master,
we're just having trouble with our neighbor, you'll become
the water management -- the super water management agency
for the country. You have river masters if you -- it's
totally up to -- to your discretion. But if you were to
follow this line of thinking, you end up supervising water
distribution across the west and part of the east.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the disputes are going to
come up here eventually anyway if the States are
intransigent. Ultimately it will be a dispute about the
application of the compact and it will come back here
anyway, won't it?
MR. ROBBINS: Justice Scalia, that is absolutely
correct, but the difference is where compacts have
mechanisms within them that are designed to work out these
Colorado's position is and the special master's position
was it was in the Court's interest -- to refer these
matters back to those compact administrations. You --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Counsel, do you think it's
any more likely today than in the past that the two States
will be able to work out their continued disagreements?
MR. ROBBINS: Justice O'Connor, I agree
completely with the special master. The State of Colorado
has proposed, as referred to in his ruling, that binding
arbitration be used and has committed itself to
participate in that. To the extent there -- there have
differences, I think it is in the Court's interest -- and
been past conflicts, Colorado has said let's get them
behind us. Let's return to the compact, congressionally
sanctioned method for resolving our differences, and let's
proceed down the road. We will --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but Colorado still has
the veto in any given case on whether an arbitrator will
be appointed. Is that right?
MR. ROBBINS: That is -- under the compact,
that's correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, yes.
MR. ROBBINS: And so -- but -- but Colorado has
made a -- a very clear commitment to the special master
and does so to this Court that if arbitration is proposed,
Colorado would participate. We do not as a State find it
very acceptable to spend the time, money, and effort to
litigate these issues. After all, we have farmers.
Kansas has farmers. We need to get back to getting the
water equitably resolved through the compact mechanism.
That is our proposal. It was --
JUSTICE BREYER: So is it right then that --
let's imagine the special river master's name is Mr.
Smith, and unlike me, he knows about this stuff. And he
then -- you -- Kansas wants Mr. Smith to decide a certain
number of issues. Call them issues on page 1, whatever
they are. And as far as you're concerned, your client
would say I'm happy to have Mr. Smith. Just don't call
him a river master. Call him an arbitrator. So you're
saying that when Kansas says they would do it except
there's a problem of getting unanimity, you say the only
problem is that you won't agree.
MR. ROBBINS: At the present time, that's the
posture --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, they're the obstacle to
unanimity. So the keys are in their own pocket if they
want Mr. Smith. That's your view.
MR. ROBBINS: Our view is if they want to
arbitrate pursuant to the compact, the keys are in their
-- in their pocket. We do not believe --
JUSTICE BREYER:
unanimity because your side agrees. I mean, you heard
what he said. So I'm -- I'm trying to see --
MR. ROBBINS: Our side agrees, Your -- Justice
Breyer, with -- with the concept that this matter should
be returned to the compact administration to resolve the
differences in that forum.
JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and in that forum, you
will agree to binding arbitration.
MR. ROBBINS: In that forum, we will agree to
binding arbitration.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Binding arbitration will --
So the problem can't be one of
will mercifully keep this stuff off of our desk, won't it?
MR. ROBBINS: Yes, it will.
(Laughter.)
MR. ROBBINS: I want -- I want to make it very
clear to the Court that the State of Colorado, different
than the situation in the Pecos River, acted very
aggressively to ensure that it promptly came into
compliance with the -- with the determination that in fact
depletions were occurring, impermissible depletions were
occurring to the Arkansas River. Within 2 years, the
State of Colorado's legislature had passed the appropriate
legislation. The State engineer had passed rules and
regulations, implemented them, and enforced them. The
acquisition of replacement water, and -- and the State of
Colorado -- your -- your ruling was in 1995. By 1997, it
appears that the State of Colorado was in compliance with
the compact. That is a significant and very difficult
effort on the part of the legislature, the Governor, the
attorney general, and the State engineer.
We do not believe that this is anything like the
Pecos River. Your master in this case has not said to you
these parties are -- are torn, will not get together, and
you need to have a master, a river master, appointed. In
this instance, the State of Colorado took the exact
State had authorized millions of dollars in loans for the
opposite approach. They did everything they could to
reduce the pumping of the wells sufficiently to allow
Colorado to meet the terms of the compact, and that is an
important fact you need to glean from the special master's
report.
Now, the -- the other -- the only other point I
want to make on this is that the -- the -- it's -- it's
very important, in deciding whether or not a river master
is the appropriate course of action to determine -- and I
-- I mentioned this earlier -- whether or not the Court
wants to be in a supervisory position. I happen to agree
that the States are entitled to seek redress of their
concerns before this Court, and as you said in -- in
Oklahoma v. New Mexico, you have a serious obligation to
adjudicate disputes between the States where there are
actual and existing controversies. And -- and the fact
that you would have a river master would not eliminate the
potential for those controversies. In our view, the only
way that you can get this matter off of your plate and
into the position that Congress recognized and -- and
directed is to follow the special master's recommendation
number 12.
I'd now like to turn, if I may, to the issue of
the accuracy of the model.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question,
because you may not bother to talk about it otherwise,
about punitive damages? Your opponent didn't seem to
think it very important, but I have this question. Is it
your view that the other State waived its claim to the
punitive damages from 1985 back either by not arguing it
today or by submitting the different set of figures at the
time the -- the issue was before the master the last time
around?
MR. ROBBINS: Justice Stevens, in response to
your question, we believe that in fact the issue of
prejudgment interest, or punitive damages, is law of the
case in this matter. The special master set out a formula
by which he proposed how the damages should be calculated.
Kansas argued for actual value of money, a rather rigid
theory of compensation, and the special master chose in
fact a balancing of the equities approach. He suggested
that the appropriate means to calculate those -- that
prejudgment interest on the -- the nominal damages --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Did he -- did he make that
suggestion or did the other -- did Kansas make that
suggestion?
MR. ROBBINS: The special master ruled on how he
believed the damages should be calculated.
JUSTICE STEVENS: In this time around or in the
preceding --
MR. ROBBINS: In the preceding time around. And
what he said was that the damages from 1950 to 1968 should
be -- should -- should receive a inflationary increase to
reflect the inflationary tendencies, but that they should
not be dealt with under prejudgment interest. In other
words, it shouldn't be compounded through prejudgment
interest. Only the damages from 1969 forward should be
compounded using prejudgment interest.
Kansas did not except to that methodology.
Kansas excepted to the fact that he didn't give them
prejudgment interest on the damages from 1950 forward. In
the opinion that you authored for the Court, you accepted
the master's methodology, and you did one thing and only
one.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the master's methodology
really wasn't at issue.
MR. ROBBINS: The master's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The only issue before us, as I
remember it, was the date from which the prejudgment
interest would run.
MR. ROBBINS: That's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's -- that's all that was
argued.
And it seemed to me that if it had been a fixed
sum rather than an -- a changing amount as years went by,
that clearly we would have -- the interest would have run
on the existing liability. But it's an unusual case
because the damages are changing as time goes by.
MR. ROBBINS: It is and I agree with you,
Justice Stevens. It is an unusual case. But the -- the
critical element here is that the master was looking for
an equitable way to arrive at a damage sum.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except that, as I read
his report, he was simply interpreting our opinion, best
he could, on the second go-round.
MR. ROBBINS: This -- this go-round?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.
MR. ROBBINS: That's correct, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:
what's before us here. It -- it seems to me that your
best argument for no interest post '85 on the pre-'85
damages is to say, well, it's uncertain, it's hard to
compute, but that doesn't quite work because this Court --
and of course, the special master -- allowed damages --
the interest on post-'85 damages even though those are
equally difficult to compute.
MR. ROBBINS: It isn't the -- if I may, Justice
Kennedy, it isn't the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So I'm -- I'm saying it seems
to me that's your best argument, but there's a flaw in
And -- and I think that's
there.
MR. ROBBINS: I understand.
The -- but the -- in our view the State of
Kansas was obligated to take an exception if it disagreed
with the methodology used by the special master and
adopted in Justice Stevens' opinion by this Court. There
was a sum of damage that was calculated by that and
reported to the Court: $38 million. By moving the year
forward from 1969 to 1985, you automatically then reduce,
by some degree, the amount of that damage calculation.
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but did we -- your -- your
view is that we entirely eliminated any interest on that
past damage.
MR. ROBBINS: Prejudgment --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Pre-1985.
MR. ROBBINS: The -- the special master's
methodology, Justice Stevens, was that the damages in his
third report from 1950 to 1968 should not, under a
balancing of the equities, bear prejudgment interest at
any point in time. They should only be advanced for
inflation, which was a proposal Colorado made because
Colorado believed that it -- the changing a 1950 damage to
a -- to a 2002, or at that time a 1994, dollar value was
only fair and reasonable. We opposed the concept of
giving prejudgment interest because it would -- it would
be -- it's as if -- if this were a commercial context, we
would have been able to identify that there was a damage
going on and the theory in your prejudgment cases is we
could have put the money in the bank --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we rejected that as to
post-'85 damages.
MR. ROBBINS: You agreed that prejudgment
interest, Justice Kennedy, should be applied to post-'85
damages, not to pre-'85 damages.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but our opinion didn't
say it was just post-'85 damages. Our -- our opinion
didn't -- didn't answer the question, and -- and the
reason, of course, is we didn't actually think about it
because nobody even -- nobody argued it at that time.
MR. ROBBINS: Our view was that -- that -- our
view is, Justice Stevens, that an exception needed to be
taken if the master's methodology was under challenge.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So in a way you really are
arguing waiver I think.
MR. ROBBINS: We are arguing law of the case.
Yes, we are.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is consistent with his
failure to argue it today.
MR. ROBBINS: That's -- that is our position,
Your Honor.
I would like to, if -- if I may, move off of
prejudgment interest. I would like to talk, while I still
have a few minutes, a little bit about this model and the
10-year average.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Can you give -- I'm -- I'm not
sure I understand the dispute. Can you give me in -- in
-- without using up all of your time, a -- basically a
simple example to illustrate the difference between the
two contending methodological positions?
MR. ROBBINS: Yes, I can, Justice Souter.
Under the -- the master's formulation, which is
agreed to by Colorado, the damages which occur in each
year, 1950 through 1984, are -- are computed at -- in --
as nominal damages in the year in which they occur. They
are then expanded by the -- by an inflationary formula
which allows the dollar in 1950 to be calculated in a 2002
dollar.
In 1985 and to the present, any damages that
occur are advanced both for inflation, but then they are
also awarded a prejudgment interest, which is compounded.
In other words, if inflation is 2 or 3 percent through the
period on a long-term average, but -- but investments are
at 6 or 7 percent --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I got you.
MR. ROBBINS: -- those damages advance.
Colorado's -- Kansas' view is that commencing in
-- in 1985, all of the damages from 1950 to the present
should receive prejudgment interest. The difference then
becomes, if you use the master's methodology, the -- the
current amount of money in 2002 dollars which Colorado
would owe Kansas is approximately $29 million. If you use
the Kansas methodology -- and this is the impact of
prejudgment interest -- it would be $52 million. Under
the original formulation that was presented to the Court,
the value under the master's formulation, which did not
charge prejudgment interest on the '50 to '68 dollars,
both States agreed that that would have been $38 million.
So from Colorado's perspective, having succeeded in our --
in our exception that the year should be 1985 instead of
1969, we in fact, under the Kansas theory, lose some
$20-some million in the proposition, which we don't
believe is what the Court intended.
Let me -- let me turn very quickly to the model,
if I may.
The -- the issue here is not Colorado's
obligation to deliver water to -- to the river system.
Colorado has both senior surface water rights and the
State of Kansas that it has obligations to protect.
Remember, the compact envisions that this subsequent
development can't injure water users in either Kansas or
Colorado. As a result, Colorado must ensure that on a
monthly basis, water is placed into the river so
depletions are -- are compensated for in the system as
they occur.
The problem here is not that process. The
problem here is a model that is inaccurate. Beginning in
your first report, you quoted with favor the special
master's comments about this model in dealing with the
winter water storage program, which was an issue which you
agreed should be dismissed several years ago. You
indicated that depletions shown were well within the range
of error and it could not be told if it was an impact or
an error that the model was describing.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Counsel, your time is running
short. This is very important. I think you misunderstood
Justice Souter's question. He asked you to give us an
example of the Kansas versus Colorado approach as to the
10-year model. You answered him about the interest.
Could you --
MR. ROBBINS: I'm so sorry.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- could you tell us really --
MR. ROBBINS: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Give us an example of the
difference between the two.
MR. ROBBINS: Yes. The difference between the
two is this. We believe that the model over a long period
of time, as it's developer, Mr. Durbin, said, is
reasonably accurate. We -- we agree with that, and we are
willing to use it like that. But that means you have to
use -- look at it over extended periods of time. Our view
is that you simply look at the model, which is predicting
over-deliveries and under-deliveries, predicting them.
They don't have any relationship to what Colorado is
really putting into the system. They are predictions.
And in some years where you -- where you look back and you
know from the gauges the model is over-predicting a
significant amount, you -- you want to be -- and you know
in a subsequent year it's going to under-predict, you want
getting close to what's really going on. It is not an
effort to carry dry-year depletions into wet years or vice
versa. It is, in fact, an effort to allow the model's
inherent inaccuracies to play out so that you get a more
accurate result in each 10th year.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't -- why isn't the
result that you -- of -- of your position that you would
get a more accurate set of predictions if all you were
making was a 10-year calculation, but you will not get a
more accurate set of predictions with respect to any one
year? And in fact, it is with respect to any one year
to allow that to smooth out so that you are, in fact,
that's important under the compact. In other words, they
-- they plan every year, not every 10 years. So why does
a 10-year accuracy help you in solving the practical
problem you have on a year-to-year basis?
MR. ROBBINS: As proposed by the special master,
the model is not used every 10 year -- or every 10th year.
It's used every year. If you're looking at --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I know. But it's used on the
basis of 10-year figures which will not be accurate
particularly with respect to any given year even though
they would be -- they would be accurate if you were only
interested in a calculation every 10 years.
MR. ROBBINS: You are making --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Does it -- can -- can you --
can you get a better prediction on a year-to-year basis is
what I'm saying.
MR. ROBBINS: You get a better prediction on a
year-to-year basis. A -- a better prediction if you're
looking at the model over 10 years versus looking at the
model just running it in a given year. Colorado does not
want to be in a position, Justice Souter, where we are
accused of violating the compact because there is an
inaccuracy in the tool that is being used.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you --
MR. ROBBINS: It --

Robbins.
MR. ROBBINS: Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
It's the position of the United States that --
that we agree with Colorado and with the special master
that a river master should not be appointed in this case.
The compact between the States of Kansas and
Colorado sets up a commission that is responsible for
implementing the obligations in that compact, which has to
do with Colorado's obligations to deliver a certain amount
of water to Kansas. The commission is also charged with
investigating violations of the compact, and the compact
includes a dispute resolution mechanism of submission to
binding arbitration if the -- the States agree to that.
The -- the commission also certainly could use other
dispute resolution mechanisms and certainly would have the
authority to do if it wanted to.
The States have agreed to that. Congress has
enacted it into law, and this Court should permit the
parties to use that mechanism to resolve any disputes that
might arise in the future rather than putting a river
master in place under the authority of this Court.
Now, the Court has -- itself has frequently
stated that consensual resolution of disputes of this sort
is preferable to litigation. As the special master
pointed out, in the two river basins just north of the
Arkansas River, the Republican River and the Platte River,
the parties recently, after having a dispute, including
these very same two States in one of them, have come to a
consensual resolution of the dispute that they had. And I
think that does show, as the special master pointed out,
that these -- the States can -- in fact, the disputes in
of well pumping, among other things. As the special
master pointed out, I think that shows that the States can
use a consensual mechanism to come to a resolution, and
this Court ought to continue its often-stated preference
for consensual rather than litigative type of solutions to
problems of this sort.
If the Court were to appoint a river master in
this case, then I think the question would arise in any
future case in which you have two States that have
conflicting interests with regard to an ongoing activity,
as what happened with river compacts, equitable
those cases also had to do with groundwater and the effect
apportionments, and in other areas, whenever there's an
inherently conflicting interest, the Court would have an
appeal that it should appoint a master to oversee a decree
or judgment. And I think rather than -- that -- that
would be directly contrary to the Court's other statement
in the area, which is not only that the Court prefers and
that it's far preferable to have consensual resolutions,
but also that the Court does not favor appointing agents
or functionaries to carry out its decrees.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So I guess we made a mistake
with respect to the Pecos River and what was the other
one? Delaware?
MR. FELDMAN: Yes. The Pecos River -- I mean,
there were a couple of differences, in addition to the
ones that Mr. Robbins pointed out. One difference is that
not only the special master, but the parties in the Pecos
River case -- neither party objected to the appointment of
a river master or even to the more extraordinary step of
clothing the master with authority to make determinations
that would be reviewable only under a clearly erroneous
standard. In this case, there is a party that objects to
it.
And I would -- I think there's another
difference that's important that the Court ought to keep
in mind. At the time the Pecos River master was
appointed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(e), which
the Court has said that the Federal rules provide a guide
for this Court's original cases, rule 53(e) provided that
findings of fact by a master appointed by a district court
shall be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard, and
the Court, indeed, used that mechanism for the -- it
provided that the river master in that case would be
reviewed under that standard.
As of 2003, rule 53 -- it's now rule 53(g) --
provides that masters appointed by district courts said
their findings shall be reviewable only under a de novo
standard unless the parties agree otherwise. Therefore,
at the present time -- and again, following the Court's
rule 17.2 that says that the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure should be guides -- and I think they are a
useful guide -- the appropriate course here, if the Court
were to appoint a river master, would be to appoint one
whose findings will be reviewable de novo.
But that itself raises problems because if the
findings of the river master are reviewable de novo, it's
really just a continuation of the current litigation and
it doesn't really advance things any. The parties will
submit the evidence to the river master. He'll make his
determinations, and then they'll come to the Court.
That's really more what the special master does at the
current time.
So I think that under all of those
circumstances, both the Court's preference for a
consensual resolution of disputes, its disfavoring of
appointments of agents to carry out its decrees, the
Court's recognition that it's the Court's obligation to
decide cases of this sort and it can't -- it's not the
obligation of other parties to do that, and the commission
that Congress has put into place specifically to deal with
this kind of problem, and with a specific recognition that
there could be disputes and a provision for a dispute
resolution, I think that the Court should not appoint a
river master in this case.
As far as the prejudgment interest issue, it's
the position of the United States also that the special
master and Colorado are correct, and prejudgment interest
should not be awarded. I think it's a familiar principle
in -- to this Court in litigation that if a party -- when
the time comes to make objections, a party has to make all
of its objections if it wants the Court to hear them.
In this case, the special master came up with a
recommendation in his third report about how to -- what
should happen with prejudgment interest, under which the
early years -- the -- the amount of the damages in those
early years would never be subject to prejudgment
interest.
Now, Kansas objected to that and said we should
move the year back to 1950. We should get prejudgment
interest on everything back to year one. But they never
made the objection that if you -- if the Court disagrees
with that, which it did, that the method that the master
had used to deal with the prejudgment interest as of 1969
was incorrect. That was the time that Kansas should have
brought it to the Court and Kansas didn't do that.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So you're arguing they've
waived the -- your argument is they waived the objection
basically.
MR. FELDMAN: Yes. I think --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think you used the
word waiver in your brief, and I don't think that Colorado
did either. But I guess that's the essence of your
argument.
MR. FELDMAN: I -- I actually think it's a
combination of two things. On the one hand, what the
Court actually said in its opinion was that the special
master had awarded damages only insofar as necessary to
satisfy the demands of equity, something to that effect.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you not agree that if it
was a one-shot injury, not an ongoing injury, that the
normal reading would be the injury -- the interest should
run on the laws?
MR. FELDMAN: I think in the normal contract
case that doesn't have the kinds of equities that this
case had, that is the current rule, that prejudgment
interest would run. But this kind of case involves
damages that go back 50-odd years. It could have been --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And it involves continuing,
ongoing --
MR. FELDMAN: And they're -- they're ongoing
that are different in amount in every year, that it's not
merely that Colorado was violating the compact as of 1950,
although it probably didn't know it at that time, but that
Kansas didn't bring a suit until 1985 and the fact, I
think, that Colorado has always agreed to pay -- to adjust
the damages for inflation. So, in essence, Kansas is
getting a portion of what the prejudgment interest would
normally cover for those early years. I think if all
that's put together, I think the Court's conclusion that
the master's conclusion was just the amount that equity
dictates was correct, and that if Kansas didn't like that,
it should --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Feldman, the Government
takes no position on this 1-year versus 10-year
computation?
MR. FELDMAN: No, the Government doesn't have a
position on that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Too hard for you?
(Laughter.)
MR. FELDMAN: That issue involves the
particularities of this case and the Government doesn't
really have a particular interest in how that gets
resolved.
If there's no further questions, that concludes
the argument.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
Feldman.
Mr. Draper, you have 2 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. DRAPER
MR. DRAPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
I want to state that we do not believe that we
waived our position on the interest calculation as was
just suggested in the -- in the last colloquy. The reason
that we didn't do that is because we filed an exception
last time against every respect in which the special
master was not recommending full interest. And it turned
out that the Court chose the -- the test that we now have,
which is a relatively easy test to apply. It has certain
incentives that grow out of it that make sense. And we
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
believe that we sufficiently excepted to that. If look at
our brief from that exception, the one in -- in support of
our exceptions, in particular -- particularly to page 25,
footnote 8, we specifically addressed the issue that the
-- the master was not allowing any interest in that 1950
through 1968 period.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You're talking about
the brief in the earlier case.
MR. DRAPER: In the earlier case, to the third
report of the special master.
I would -- also, on the other points that were
raised, you need to be --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a lot of money
involved, and -- and you certainly didn't argue it here.
I don't recall that point being argued. And with all that
money being involved, I would have thought it would have
been argued.
MR. DRAPER: Well, we were -- we were arguing
the larger issues on interest, but we were asking that
interest not be denied to us during that '50 through 1968
period. That was very clear from our briefs, and we
specifically singled out that part of it in that footnote.
So I don't believe it's appropriate that -- to conclude
that we have waived that argument.
And I would point out also that the only reason
that it was done that way -- and the calculations of the
parties did -- did in connection with that review -- is
because the special master required it. There is no other
reason that we did it. We did not volunteer to do it that
way. We did not like doing it that way. The master said
that's the way it's going to be in my recommendation. How
much would that amount to? We did not agree in any way to
that part of the calculation.
I would also point out that with respect to the
amounts involved, that you need to be careful. The
amounts cited by Mr. Robbins are not from the same year.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you. Thank you,
Mr. Draper.
MR. DRAPER: Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the
