CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 12-895,
Rosemond v. United States.
Mr. Elwood.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ELWOOD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
It has long been a bedrock principle of
American law that aiding and abetting liability requires
proof that an accomplice act with purposeful intent to
facilitate or encourage the crime of conviction and that
mere knowing assistance is insufficient.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you agree that the jury
could find the defendant guilty of the firearms charge
under a proper instruction?  In other words, was there
sufficient evidence so that if a proper instruction were
given, there could have been a conviction?
MR. ELWOOD:  Even if the -- I think in this
particular case, even if the jury had been given a
proper instruction, it would have been a difficult
charge to make out because the government never really
argued facilitation after getting knowledge of the
firearm.  There was never evidence of foreknowledge; the
government never asserted evidence of foreknowledge.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I guess we can get
into later to whether or not if you know a firearm is
being carried and if you then facilitate the commission
of the underlying felony by driving the car,
participating in the transaction, whether that's
sufficient.
But let me ask you this:  Would the
instruction that was given, which was at JA 196, would
it be okay if Paragraph 1, "The defendant knew his
cohort used a firearm," I think there is a real problem
with that, because it's retrospective.
Would the instruction have been sufficient
if the defendant knew his cohort would use or was
carrying?  Would that change it?
MR. ELWOOD:  Well, I think at least that
would have required foreknowledge.  But I think it would
still have been problematic because it would only have
required knowing facilitation.  And courts,
traditionally, have required intentional facilitation,
that is, they intend to further the crime.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You do not agree, then,
that if you know that there's going -- that there's a bank
robbery afoot and you're cooperating in that, you're --
you're the wheelman, and you also know that the -- you
know that the people who are conducting the bank robbery
are carrying firearms, you say that there's no criminal
liability for the firearms unless you intended them to
use the firearms; is that your position?
MR. ELWOOD:  It's our position that you
could infer from the fact that you're assisting the
transaction involving --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no.
MR. ELWOOD:  Knowledge is not itself intent.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Justice Scalia can protect -- his
own question.  But the question is:  What -- what does
the jury have to find?  I know they can -- I know what
they can infer, but the question from Justice Scalia is,
you're the -- you drive -- you drive the car, you know
firearms are there and might be used, is that
sufficient?  And that's his question.
MR. ELWOOD:  I -- I think that that would
be -- that would support a verdict.  That would support
a verdict.  The only question --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, wait.  It would
support a verdict -- you're saying it would support a
finding of -- of intent.
MR. ELWOOD:  That's correct.  But the
question is whether you don't even have to instruct a
jury --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's assume there's a lot
of evidence that he didn't really want them to use
firearms, that there's no way you can say he intended
them to use, but he knew that they had firearms.
MR. ELWOOD:  And I think that you can
conclude from that that his purpose in assuming that
he's driving --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  No, no, you can't.
It's my hypothetical.  And you cannot conclude from
that.  There is so much other evidence.  This -- this
man hates firearms.  He does not like firearms.  There
is no way he could have intended them to use firearms.
But he knew they had firearms.
MR. ELWOOD:  You know, I hate to be accused
of resisting the hypothetical, because in that -- in
that case, I don't think it matters whether you have the
subjective desire, like you think, boy, I sure wish
those firearms weren't involved.  But because at that
point, your goal is to facilitate and make sure that
this bank robbery --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Facilitate the crime.
MR. ELWOOD:  -- with the gun succeeds.  The
whole thing with the gun.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you don't have to -- you
don't have to --
MR. ELWOOD:  But that is your -- we would
say that that is the purpose in facilitating.  And the
question is not just that.  The question is whether
you --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So if you intend a
crime -- if you intend a crime and you know that the
crime is being conducted with firearms, that's enough.
MR. ELWOOD:  I don't think that that -- I
think that you have to have the fore -- the
foreknowledge.  And I think that there are certainly
hypothesize --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Beforehand.  Before -- you
know beforehand that the crime is going to be
perpetrated with firearms.  That's all you do.  You know
beforehand, and you facilitate the crime.
MR. ELWOOD:  I think that you -- the
question is whether -- you can't even conceive of the
circumstance where knowing -- that is, participation --
knowing that a firearm would be used or carried.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, give me an example of
that.  Give us --
MR. ELWOOD:  For example, if you agree to
drive your neighbor to pick up drugs at some place in
Philadelphia or -- let's make it Pittsburgh.  And then
you drive him to West Virginia to spend the weekend
dealing.  On the way there he tells you, the guy who
distributed these to me, you know, he always carries a
Derringer in his boot.
And at that point, you don't facilitate his
use or carriage of the gun with respect to the drug
distribution offense.  It has no role in -- in the
crime.  And so I think you can conceive of enough
circumstances --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And I don't -- I don't
understand the example.  The -- the alleged aider and
abetter learns about this after it's happened?  That's
the idea?
MR. ELWOOD:  Yes, but he's still
facilitating the drug distribution offense at a time he
knows that a gun is, you know, being carried in relation
to it.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me change -- let
me -- maybe this is the same as Justice Scalia's
hypothetical, but let me try it.  Suppose that two guys
have a meeting and it's -- it's in a place that's --
where there's an electronic eavesdropping device.  In
fact, there's a camera.  So it's all recorded.  So we
know exactly what was said.  And the principal says,
here's the deal, I'm going to rob a convenience store
and I'm going to carry a gun.
And the aider and abetter says, well, all
right.  I'm in on the -- you know, I'm in on robbing the
convenience store, but I don't want anything having to
do with the gun.  I think you should carry a baseball
bat.
The principal says, no, that's the deal.
I'm robbing the store.  I'm carrying a gun.  Take it or
leave it.  Are you going to drive me there?
And -- and the other guy says, I hate guns,
I don't want to have anything to do with guns.  I -- I
hate this idea about the guns.  They go back and forth.
And the -- the principal says finally, look,
this is it.  This is the deal.  I'm robbing the store.
I'm using a gun.  Are you going to help me or not?
And the guy says, well, all right.  I'm
going to drive you, but I want it noted for the record
that I'm opposed -- I'm opposed to the use of a gun.
(Laughter.)
MR. ELWOOD:  And at that point, it's his
purpose to facilitate a transaction and to, you know,
help it succeed and it's at a time when he knows that a
gun will be used and that -- I think you can conclude
that that is his purpose.
JUSTICE ALITO:  See -- so I don't really
see -- I can't -- I can't think of a situation where a
person facilitates the crime, knows what the crime is
going to be, knows that a gun is going to be used but
doesn't intend for the gun to be used.
MR. ELWOOD:  The question is --
JUSTICE ALITO:  In those two situations,
knowledge and intent, seem to me to be -- to be the same
thing.
MR. ELWOOD:  The question is whether there
are -- because there are just no instances that are more
like my hypothetical than like your hypothetical.  So
you don't even have to bother troubling the jury about
whether they had the intent.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I didnâ€™t understand
your hypotheticals.  If you could give it to us again.
MR. ELWOOD:  Well, the point of it is that
at a time when you are -- when you are still
participating in the underlying offense, the drug
trafficking offense, you know that a gun is being
carried in relation to it.  But you don't have any
intent to facilitate it.  You don't care one way or the
other if it gets used.  You don't intend to facilitate
it, and you don't facilitate it.  And the question is
whether there are --
JUSTICE ALITO:  But you facilitate --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's -- that's a
conclusion.  The jury, it seems to me, could say you do
facilitate it if in these hypotheticals you drive the
car --
MR. ELWOOD:  But the thing is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- with knowledge that the
gun might be used.
MR. ELWOOD:  No, but the gun is not going to
be used in your act of facilitation.  It may be used
over in Philadelphia, and you aren't doing --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the submission is
MR. ELWOOD:  And the question --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the gun would never
have been used if you didn't drive the -- or carried if
you didn't drive the car.
MR. ELWOOD:  But I think the jury could
equally well conclude that you did not intend to
facilitate the use of the gun and you did not facilitate
the use of the gun.  And the question is whether you
even need to trouble the jury with it.  Because the
government's instruction conclusively presumes both
knowledge -- or conclusively presumes intent from
knowledge alone and it conclusively presumes
facilitation of the gun from facilitation of the
underlying offense.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Or in my -- in my
hypothetical, could a rational jury say he knew about
it, but he didn't intend it?
MR. ELWOOD:  I think that in your case with
the foreknowledge and where he, you know, facilitates,
he carries the gun and he carries the person to the
offense, I think that that would be a tough slog.  In a
case -- but ours is a case where there isn't
foreknowledge and the government never argued that he
knew before the gun -- before the gun was fired that it
was his associate who was the shooter.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in my case -- and I'll
finish.  I want to ask another question about this.  But
in my case, if the judge had given the instruction, it's
enough that he knew about it.  He facilitated the crime
when he knew there was a gun.  Would that be error?
MR. ELWOOD:  I think it would be error
because you're instructing them on the wrong elements.
It might be harmless error.  But the point -- both sides
agree here that you have to facilitate the crime of
conviction and you have to intend that the gun be used.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think it's ever
harmless error to not instruct the jury -- or to
instruct the jury not to find one of the elements of the
crime.  If, indeed, intent is necessary, it seems to me
he has to instruct the jury to find intent.  It's not up
to the court to say, well, there surely was intent
anyway so it's harmless error.  The jury has to find
intent.
MR. ELWOOD:  I think -- you know what, I'm
fine with it being a harmful error, too.  But my point
was merely to note that I think that it is something
that you have to instruct the jury on as a proper
element --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  But what are
we instructing --
MR. ELWOOD:  -- even if it winds up not
making a difference.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think what we're
driving at here, and I think this is the moment you're
resisting, but to me, and as you can tell from my
colleague's questions, if you know that someone's
carrying a gun, and whether you want them to use it or
not is irrelevant, if they take it out and use it and
you have gone along with them in the crime, you're
guilty.  Okay?  That -- that's what we're driving at.
Assume that I believe that.  Assume that I
believe that if you have knowledge of the gun, and that
I am participating in the crime with your knowledge of
that gun, whether the knowledge is secured before the
crime starts or during the crime, if I continue to
participate in the crime knowing that you have a gun,
then that's knowledge of the gun and intent to
facilitate.
I thought the example that you were relying
on here or the issue that got confused in the briefs was
whether or not, from the sequence of facts in this case,
you can actually discern that intent to facilitate the
crime because the alleged shooter, which your client
said was someone else, jumped into the car and the car
took off before anybody could abandon the crime.  That's
what I actually thought this case was about:  At what
juncture do you instruct the jury to say that you have
to be a participant with knowledge of the crime?
But you're saying something different right
now.  You're almost suggesting that there has to be a
pre-knowledge that the gun will be used.
MR. ELWOOD:  No, I don't think -- I don't
think that there has to be pre-knowledge.  My point is
this:  That there are circumstances I think where you
can know of a gun and be participating in the underlying
-- underlying predicate offense and not facilitate the
use of the gun.  And I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm hard to imagine
that.  Give me an example.
MR. ELWOOD:  For example, if you -- your
job, you're the lowest level guy in a drug organization.
You stand on a street corner every night and you hand
out drugs to anybody who comes up.  You don't carry a
gun.  Nobody has ever carried a gun at that street
corner.  One night you're doing it and you see that the
guy is -- that the guy who you work for, his enforcer is
coming by and you know he always carries a gun.  He
walks behind you and, you know, he's present and around
you for about 90 seconds, but during that time, you do
exactly what you always did.
I think a jury could conclude -- and I'm not
saying that they couldn't conclude otherwise, but they
could conclude that he didn't facilitate the use or
carriage of the gun.  He was just --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What would the
instruction look like?
MR. ELWOOD:  It would just --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  To -- to -- what would
it look like to capture the difference you're trying to
convey?
MR. ELWOOD:  It would just say that the --
that the jury has to find that the defendant facilitated
the use or carriage of a gun during and in relation to a
crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, then you come --
MR. ELWOOD:  -- and that they intended to do
so.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- you come up against
the government's argument that you don't have to
facilitate every element.
MR. ELWOOD:  Right.  But that's the thing.
Those are what we think would be the proper instruction,
that they just have to be instructed on the facilitation
and on the intent.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm surprised to hear you
say that you don't need prior knowledge.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I am too.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you need prior knowledge.
MR. ELWOOD:  I think you have to have prior
knowledge before you facilitate it.  I think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
MR. ELWOOD:  Right.  Exactly.
MR. SCALIA:  So what did you mean by -- by
you don't need prior knowledge?
MR. ELWOOD:  You don't need prior knowledge
before the whole transaction happens.  If you continue
to -- if there's an act of facilitation after you learn
of it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  After you know.
MR. ELWOOD:  Right.  Exactly.  That's all I
mean by the absence of prior knowledge.  But I mean,
everyone here agrees that you need to have knowledgeable
before facilitation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Elwood, you're
dealing with all kinds of hypotheticals.  But in this
case we had a jury determination that Rosemond was the
person -- he was convicted of carrying ammunition,
right?  There were two counts of carrying -- possession
of the ammunition.  And couldn't one infer from that
that if he -- he possessed the ammunition, he was the gun
carrier?
MR. ELWOOD:  Two things, Justice Ginsburg.
First, the government never raised this below and it
wasn't pressed or passed on below, and so I think under
Glover v. United States this Court wouldn't ordinarily
consider that in the first instance, would leave it for
remand.
But secondly, I think that it's not clear
enough.  I mean, you can't say beyond a reasonable doubt
that the error didn't infect that, too, because the jury
was instructed four times that you can possess something
through constructive possession, through a confederate.
And I think when the jury concludes that he is guilty of
a possession offense, which is 924(c) as a possession
offense, as an aider and abetter, and they marked on the
judge's instruction that he used the gun, he carried the
gun, that the jury could have believed that they were --
that he constructively possessed the gun and thereby
constructively possessed the ammunition.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the evidence
that the jury had on whether he possessed the
ammunition?
MR. ELWOOD:  I think the only evidence of
possession was that it was inside the gun that was
fired.  And I think the jury rejected the idea that he
was the shooter because the two eyewitnesss said that
the shooter was someone else, that the shooter was the
guy in the backseat, who was Ronald Joseph.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just didn't -- you said
the only evidence was that it was inside the gun?
MR. ELWOOD:  The ammunition was inside the
gun.  And the only evidence of his --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what was the evidence?
I thought there was evidence that he possessed
cartridges.
MR. ELWOOD:  No.  The only evidence was that
the evidence was inside the gun -- or I'm sorry, the
evidence -- that the ammunition was inside the gun.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And was there any evidence
that he had the gun?
MR. ELWOOD:  The evidence that he had the
gun was the -- the guy who was the other shooter --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, was the evidence
that he had the gun and the evidence of the cartridges
are exactly the same?
MR. ELWOOD:  They are exactly the same.  The
only evidence was that the cartridges were inside the
gun.  And the evidence -- the two eyewitnesss who were
at the scene said that the person got out of the
driver's side, and the evidence suggests that Mr.
Rosemond was on the passenger side, and that he got out
of the backseat, and he was in the front seat.
So the -- the evidence, I think, is that he
was -- he was merely in the car, not that he was a
shooter.  And the jury, remember, asked:  Do we have to
answer question 3, which was the -- all the different
ways you can use the gun -- if we find him guilty on an
aiding and abetting theory?  Which certainly suggests
they did not believe he was the shooter.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did -- did he facilitate
the crime after the shots were fired?
MR. ELWOOD:  The government did not ever
argue facilitation after the shots were fired, I suspect
because -- they only argued that he -- that what
happened afterwards was evidence he was the shooter.  I
suspect because they appreciated that the offense was
over with.  He was only charged with possession of
marijuana with intent to distribute.  When Mr. Gonzales
took off with the marijuana and they lost control, you
know, they went around afterwards looking for him,
which, you know, there's not even very much evidence of
that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But do we have cases that
say that assisting flight immediately after the crime is
not aiding and abetting the crime?  The crime is over?
So everybody says the crime's over.  Let's -- let's walk
home.
MR. ELWOOD:  I -- I am not aware and the
government hasn't cited any.  I mean, there's --
there's -- for different crimes, you know, there's --
there's different law about whether flight is part of
the offense.
But in any event, the question is whether
that would be aiding and abetting that crime, the
possession offense or some distinct crime, or whether
that would be being an accessory after the fact.  And
that was never charged.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it -- is it just
flight?  I thought there was evidence that they were
chasing the people who robbed them.
MR. ELWOOD:  There was no evidence that that
intent to chase them was ever communicated to Mr.
Rosemond.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, he jumps in
the car and, you know, they're going after them.
MR. ELWOOD:  That itself was disputed.  But
the question is, even if they're chasing him, that might
be attempt to possess the marijuana to get it back.  It
might be conspiracy to possess the marijuana, but that
wasn't -- wasn't charged.  The only thing was
possession.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it might be --
it might be an effort to continue the crime of -- in
other words, it might make a difference whether the
people who are being chased look and see two guys in the
car or three guys in the car.  If somebody says -- and I
realize you dispute these facts -- let's go get them and
the guy jumps in the car, it seems to me that that's
aiding and abetting the underlying illegal activity with
knowledge, of course, that guns were used.
MR. ELWOOD:  I agree.  But first, that's not
a theory that the government ever espoused.  They never
argued that facilitation.
And secondly, I don't know that that would
be facilitation of possession of marijuana with intent
to distribute it.  That ended under the court's
instructions when they lost control of the marijuana
when Mr. Gonzales disappeared.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I understand your argument
about intent, but are you also arguing that the -- that
the actus reus instruction was insufficient?  The
instruction about what your client did?
MR. ELWOOD:  Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think it's necessary
for an aider and abetter to facilitate every element of
a criminal offense?
MR. ELWOOD:  We're not saying that.  We are
saying that when you -- you have to instruct them did he
facilitate the actual crime of conviction.  Because what
the government is doing here, what their instruction
does is it conclusively presumes that he facilitated the
distinct offense, which this Court has said, the
entirely new crime of 924(c), from the fact that they
did the underlying offense.
Their favorite example in the brief is a
mail fraud example.  But under the government's theory,
because you engage in an act of mail fraud, you could be
convicted of racketeering without any additional actus
reus because that is a predicate crime to RICO.  And
that's the thing is we're just saying you can't presume
the full offense -- facilitation of the full offense
from the fact that you just facilitated one element.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So if there were not -- if
the -- the drug offense itself were not illegal, there -- there
wasn't a drug offense and then the -- the additional
firearm element, it wouldn't be necessary for him -- for
the defendant to facilitate every element of that
offense.  It's dependent on the fact that there's this
other criminal conduct.
MR. ELWOOD:  We're just saying that they
have to be -- the jury just has to be instructed to ask,
did he facilitate the crime of conviction?  And they're
asking a different -- they're asking a different
question, essentially.  And it wouldn't present the same
risk that you would convict someone twice and they'd
serve two consecutive sentences under the hypothetical
you suggest, but we still say they should be asked
whether they facilitated the right crime.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but the crime of
conviction was -- was a drug offense with the use of a
firearm, right?
MR. ELWOOD:  It was 924(c), a crime with the
long name.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And so I thought -- I
thought that the law is pretty clear that if you -- if
you facilitate an offense, you do not have to facilitate
each element of that offense, so long as you have
knowledge that that element existed.
MR. ELWOOD:  And our submission is just that
the jury still has to be asked, did he facilitate the
crime.  This is -- both sides agree that you have to ask
-- that one of the elements is whether they facilitated
the crime.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but more precisely,
they could be asked did he facilitate the drug deal
knowing that a firearm was going to be used in the drug
deal.  Would that satisfy you?
MR. ELWOOD:  No.  We think they're asking
both the wrong questions then.  But -- is there --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what
your position is.  He has to use the gun himself?
MR. ELWOOD:  No.  His -- our only position
is that they have to ask the jury, did he facilitate the
924(c) offense.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  I think it would help
if you told us what the definition of the crime is.
We'll talk about the jury instructions later.
Justice Scalia is asking whether or not if you
facilitate the drug crime knowing that a weapon is being
carried, if that is sufficient for aiding and abetting
as a legal matter?  Forget the jury instructions.
MR. ELWOOD:  And it's our submission that
you have to both facilitate the 924(c) offense and that
you have to have the intent that the gun be used or
carried during and in relation to the crime.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does that -- does that
have to do with the additional 120 months?  The
underlying crime is 48 months and then the -- the gun
makes it 120 months more consecutive?
MR. ELWOOD:  That's right.  But it's -- I
think our -- the reason why we think it makes a
difference is because it's a different crime.  And the
government is trying to get the jury to conclusively
presume from the fact that you did the one crime, that
you must also have facilitated the other.  And we just
don't think that that is something that you can say with
100 percent certainty so you can remove it from jury
determination.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Isn't criminal law -- isn't
criminal law replete with crimes which have lesser
included offenses as part of them?  So wouldn't your
rule be a very difficult one to apply because it would
suggest that the person had to facilitate some part of
the crime that was not a part of a lesser included
offense?
MR. ELWOOD:  There are some courts that
apply this, our rationale to lesser included's as well.
But lesser included crimes are the same crime for
Blockburger purposes.  You can't be sentenced to both
the greater and the lesser.  And I think most courts
require that you show the intent that the gun be used.
They don't as often require that you facilitate the
discreet use of or carriage of a gun.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me go back to my
earlier hypothetical about the taped conversation.
Suppose that the alleged aider and abetter there says, I
intend for you to use the gun.  I have that intent.
However, I'm not going to do one thing to help you get
the gun or use the gun.  I don't want to -- I'm not
going to.  There's an actus reus problem there because
he doesn't facilitate the use of the gun?
MR. ELWOOD:  Well, he may say that he is not
going to facilitate it, but, depending on what his
actions are, he may -- very well may facilitate it.  If
he drives the gun and the person to the -- the crime,
you know, that is an act of facilitation.  And so, you
know, it doesn't depend on what the person says.  It
depends on what the person does.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just want to make clear,
and we'll get back to the bank robbery hypothetical.
Driving the car, knowing that a gun is being carried and
might be used, is or is not sufficient facilitation to
make you an aider and abetter in the drug -- in the gun
aspect of the crime?
MR. ELWOOD:  I think that that would be
enough, because you are carrying the gun as well as the
person.
If I could reserve --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you are not carrying.
Your -- your cohort is carrying the gun.
MR. ELWOOD:  Oh.  Yes, you're carrying --
you're -- by carrying -- the gun is in your car.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You are driving the car,
the cohort has the gun, the cohort is going to rob the
bank.  Are you or are you not aiding and abetting
because you're facilitating it by driving the car, yes
or no?
MR. ELWOOD:  We would say that, yes, that is
certainly enough to go to the jury and that -- I think
that that would be enough to show that, because you're
carrying both the gun on your cohort and you're carrying
the cohort, that that would be enough to facilitate
that.
I would like --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But only -- you say it's
enough to go to the jury and what you would ask the jury
to find is intent, right?
MR. ELWOOD:  That's correct.  You would
still have --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not just to find those
facts that were stated by Justice Kennedy.
MR. ELWOOD:  That's correct.  Intent and
facilitation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  In addition, the jury would
have to find intent.
MR. ELWOOD:  That is correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
MR. ELWOOD:  I'd like to reserve the
remainder of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Bash.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BASH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I'd like to start by defining exactly what
the government contends the mens rea requirement is for
aiding and abetting, and then give the Court an
example -- two examples to show how it differs both from
what Mr. Elwood is saying and how it differs from a
knowledge standard.
Aiding and abetting requires an intent to
facilitate or encourage the commission of an offense.
And I think that breaks down into two constituent parts:
One, an intent to make some action easier or to
encourage some action by the principal; two, the
knowledge that the principal intends to commit a crime
of which that action is a constituent part.
What Mr. Elwood is saying is something quite
different.  It's that you have to intend that the crime
succeed.  If that's true, all paid accomplices are out
if they don't intend that the crime succeed.  If the --
if the bank robbers say, hey, can you look the other
way, security guard, while we go into the bank, we'll
give you a thousand dollars if you do it, that's not
aiding and abetting under his theory if the security
guard says, well, I only wanted a thousand dollars; I
didn't care whether you ultimately succeeded in the
bank.
We give an example in our brief:  If the
person actually gives the gun so it meets the actus reus
requirement that Mr. Elwood has proposed, he actually
gives the gun to somebody, not because he cares if that
person commits the crime, which he knows he intends to
commit, but as a favor or as a friendly gesture --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's a very
fanciful hypothetical, because the one thing the guard
is going to know, that if the robber gets caught, he's
in great jeopardy of -- of being caught himself and
convicted.  Of course he wants the crime to succeed
because he doesn't want the people to be there and being
pressured by investigators or whatever to say, okay, you
know, who was in on -- who was in on this with you?
So if you're -- if you're being paid for a
crime, to assist in the commission of the crime, you
want it to succeed.
MR. BASH:  Well, if your payment is not
coming from the loot, I don't think that's really true.
But let's take that as true as given.  I mean, go back
to my example about the guy that's just doing a favor
for somebody.  Sure, you can use my gun to commit a
robbery.  I don't have any stake in it.  If you decide
tomorrow that you don't want to commit the robbery,
that's fine with me.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He has a stake in
it.  If the guy is caught, the police are going to say,
where did you get the gun?  He may turn him in or not,
but it's certainly a danger, a danger that wouldn't be
there if the crime succeeded.
MR. BASH:  I don't -- I don't think that's
the sort of intent requirement that Mr. Elwood is
talking about.  I mean, I think he's talking about an
intent that's abstracted from the idea that if you get
caught, everybody might go to jail.  I mean, that sort
of seems to beg the question of whether you're actually
going to be liable for the gun.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why don't we just
take it that we have a crime, the underlying crime, it's
a 48-month crime, and then if you have a gun in
connection with that crime, it becomes 120 months
consecutive.  And your position seems to be that all you
have to prove is facilitation of the underlying drug
offense.  And it seems to me to -- to get 10 years of
your life for the government proving no more than the
48-month charge is a bit much.
MR. BASH:  It's not proving no more than the
48-month charge.  And I'll just -- as a footnote, it's
10 years only if the gun is fired.  It's 5 years if it's
carried or used, and which obviously creates a much
greater danger to people's lives and property if it's
fired.
But it's not only proving that you
facilitated the drug offense.  It's facilitating the
drug offense with the foreknowledge that a gun was going
to be involved in it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But this instruction at
J196 says that the defendant "knew his cohort used a
firearm."  It really should say that "knew his cohort
would carry a firearm."
MR. BASH:  Justice Kennedy, two points.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because as I -- when I
read this, I thought, well, given these confusing facts,
a jury might think that there's liability if he knew
that a firearm was used, which is a very odd
interpretation, but that's -- the instruction lends
itself to that interpretation.
MR. BASH:  Justice Kennedy, that is an odd
interpretation and it's wrong and we do not contend that
liability could be imposed if you learned of the gun
only after your participation ended.  A couple points on
that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But do you agree that,
taken by itself, that one could be read that way?
MR. BASH:  Well, I don't think read in the
context of the full instruction.  If you look at --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I said taken by itself.
MR. BASH:  Oh, so not the instruction taken
by itself, but one phrase in the instruction taken by
itself?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.
MR. BASH:  I think it's possible, but I
think if you read it in the context of the full charge
and what reasonable jurors would think, you have the
formulation right above that on page 196 that mirrors
exactly the Peoni standard.  And I don't think
reasonable jurors reading that in conjunction with the
more specific instruction on count 2 could think that he
could be liable if his participation ended only after
the firearm was used.
And, Justice Kennedy, nobody below thought
that, because Petitioner never objected on the grounds
that the particular wording of this instruction allowed
conviction if you gained knowledge only after your
participation.  So at minimum --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, he proposed --
he proposed a different instruction that departed from
the instruction that was given on that point.
MR. BASH:  Mr. Chief Justice, first of all,
under Rule 30 it is not enough to propose an alternative
instruction that does not contain the defect.  You have
to lay out the specific grounds for your objection.  He
did not do that here, so it should be plain error
review.
That is doubly true here where his
instruction had its own error.  His instruction would
have required intentional facilitation of the gun, which
is the question on this Court granted certiorari.  His
instruction had --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Two -- two wrongs
don't make a right.
MR. BASH:  Two wrongs don't make a right,
but he certainly did not comply with the Rule 30
standard for raising the objection with respect to
foreknowledge that he -- that he's proposing now.  So,
at minimum, that should be reviewed for plain error.
In addition, even if the Court believes that
we waived the harmless error argument by not raising it
below with respect to his primary argument, the Court
should certainly hear our plain error -- or harmless
error argument with respect to the ammunition counts,
with respect to the instructional error that he did not
raise below.  We should have the opportunity --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Look at his -- look at his
instruction and think about the bank robbery
hypothetical with the driver of the car.  His number 2
is that they intentionally took some action to
facilitate or encourage the use of the firearm.  I think
that would be an okay instruction in the bank robbery
hypothetical.
MR. BASH:  It would be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  He drove the car.
Principal object was to rob the bank, not to use the
firearm, but he facilitated the use of a firearm.  I can
see that a judge could give that instruction.
MR. BASH:  I think the only way Petitioner
fits that instruction into his view of the law is
because the driver started out driving the people to the
bank, so he says, oh, well, you are satisfying my actus
reus requirement because you actually transported the
guns to the bank.
But tweak the hypothetical a little bit.
Suppose the getaway driver is paid only to show up at
the end and to, you know, ferry the bank robbers away.
He knows all along that it's going to be a firearm
offense.  I'm pretty sure Mr. Elwood would say:  Because
you took no act facilitating the gun in that case, you
only sort of showed up at the end, even though you knew
a gun would be used, that that's not facilitation.
So I take your point, Justice Kennedy, that
in a wide swath of cases it may not matter, but I think
in some cases it is going to matter.  And -- take his
intent requirement.  I mean, the person that lends the
gun just to be a good guy, not because he cares about
the offense, I'm pretty sure he is out.  And if the jury
is convinced, hey, I knew he was going to commit a
robbery or assault but I just did not care, if the jury
is convinced by that, he is acquitted, and that can't
possibly be right.  He would not be guilty of any 924(c)
offense at all.  I mean not only the ten-year --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you talk
practically about what the difficulties are for the
government in these scenarios?  It's nice to put
hypotheticals in where you know, where you say someone
knew X, Y and Z.  The reality is in most cases you
don't.  Occasionally you get a co-conspirator that will
tell you, but in most cases you have just the act.  A
defendant is present during a crime, a gun is pulled,
and he leaves with his cohorts.  You don't know whether he
had advance knowledge that the gun would be used because
he wasn't carrying it and he may have done nothing but
be present during the crime, left, and got a split of
the money later, correct?
MR. BASH:  If he continued participating
after he learned of the gun, yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's your point,
right?
MR. BASH:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's your --
MR. BASH:  If he learned of the gun and
said, hey, I'm out of this, he's not guilty.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So isn't this really an
argument about how you define facilitation?  You are not
arguing that -- that some form of participation in the
crime with knowledge that the gun is being used is
required.  You are really arguing about how far the
proof has to go.
MR. BASH:  Well, I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because your adversary
keeps saying mere knowledge that the gun's being used is
not enough.
MR. BASH:  I think it's more qualitative
than that and the question suggests it's purely
quantitative.  It's qualitative in the sense that the
facilitation can relate to either element.  So it can
relate to the gun in particular or -- and this could be
the guy that set up the drug deal knowing that a gun
would be involved, or set up the robbery knowing that a
gun would be involved.
I think you see in the courts of appeals
cases here the practical difficulties that come in
because, although most court of appeals, I think eight,
have technically adopted the position that you have to
facilitate the gun in a direct way, if you look at the
actual holdings of the cases it doesn't differ in
practical application from our approach.
It's -- there is one case, I think it's
Price out of the Third Circuit, where the guy may have
learned of the gun -- I may have the case name wrong,
but the guy learned of the gun only as the robbery
was -- was taking place, but he continued to participate
in the robbery while his confederate brandished the gun,
he collected the money and so forth.
And as far as your question about the
practical problems, I think explaining to a jury what
does it mean to facilitate the gun in a specific way
during a crime like that is incredibly difficult.  I
mean, we say in the brief:  What if you are exchanging
the money while the other person is brandishing the
firearm?  Maybe that person --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What is so hard about
saying, did you have knowledge that the gun would be
used, either -- and you facilitate -- but you continue
to facilitate the crime?
MR. BASH:  We --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the underlying crime.
MR. BASH:  We agree that that is law.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Bash, what about
this case?  Suppose that there are two guys and they are
talking about committing a crime, and they have the same
kind of conversation that Justice Alito was referencing,
you know, one guy says I want to bring a gun, the other
says, no, I think that's a really bad idea.  But this
time, the guy says:  Okay, you've convinced me, it's a
bad idea to bring a gun, I won't bring a gun.
And so then they go out and they rob
whatever they are robbing, and in the middle of it, you
know -- or they do a drug transaction, and in the middle
of that drug transaction the guy who said don't bring a
gun looks over and he realizes that, notwithstanding the
promise, his confederate did bring a gun.  But there
they are, they are in the middle of their drug
transaction.
So the guy, you know, they're right -- they
are handing the money to each other and the guy keeps on
doing it, all right?  Is -- is that enough, even though,
you know, there's foreknowledge, there's acts after he
-- he realizes that the guy has a gun?  Is that
sufficient?
MR. BASH:  If the gun is drawn and the
person continues to facilitate the drug crime or the
violent crime, that is enough.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what exactly would you
want him to do at that point to not be convicted of
this, of this offense?  Would you want him to just say,
you know, sort of like drop everything, I'm out of
there?  Is that the idea?
MR. BASH:  Yeah.  Take this case.  This is
an $800 marijuana deal.  It's a small-scale drug deal
that happens all the time without firearms.  As Mr.
Elwood says, usually this kind of deal is not done with
a firearm; only 5 percent of marijuana offenses have a
firearm.
Yes, if you are on that kind of small-scale
deal and all of a sudden it becomes an armed offense,
you do have an obligation to withdraw.  Now, of course,
I think you might have a duress defense if you felt like
if I withdraw I'm going to get shot, or something like
that.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  I mean, I guess
that's the question:  Is there always a reasonable
opportunity to withdraw after you see that there's a gun
in the offense that you didn't expect to be there?  And
do you think that there has to be a reasonable
opportunity to withdraw, or would you say, no, everybody
has a reasonable opportunity to withdraw all the time;
you can just leave?
MR. BASH:  Two points on that.  First, I
think a lot of that would come in through the duress
defense.  I mean, if you really feel like, oh, my God,
this guy has a gun and he might shoot me if I withdraw,
I think you have a pretty solid duress defense.
The other point I would say which is maybe a
little tangential to the hypothetical, is there's a
traditional doctrine of aiding and abetting law.  This
is at 2.06 of the Model Penal Code.  It's in the LaFave
Treatise and the Wharton Treatise, that if you
countermand your assistance after you have assisted but
before the crime is accomplished or completed -- for
example, if your assistance was only encouraging and you
start discouraging, or if you take all actions possible
to prevent the crime -- for example, you assisted, you
have a change of heart, you call the police to prevent
the crime, you are not liable for aiding and abetting.
And I think that reflects a broader point,
which is that the traditional common law contours of
aiding and abetting work pretty well with the
contemporary purposes and problems that this statute was
designed to solve.  I mean, this is a statute about the
mix of guns and drugs or guns and violence.  And I don't
see why Mr. Elwood contends that if you assist one side
of that equation or the other it is a different result.
I think if you assist either side of that equation,
knowing that the equation is going to happen, by the
principle, that is aiding and abetting.  It's aiding and
abetting under the historical test, I think it's aiding
and abetting under this Court's cases, and I don't see
why it would be a different result here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Bash, would you
explain why in this situation the gun abetted a drug
deal when there was no drug deal?  It had been thwarted.
The drugs were stolen.  They were not engaged in any
attempt to sell the drugs.  That was a failed attempt.
So how is this done, abetting a drug deal, when the deal
failed?
MR. BASH:  Well, of course, the
prosecution's principal theory was that he was the
gunman; he brought it along to facilitate his drug deal.
But assuming the theory of the facts that the gun was
fired after Gonzales absconded with the drugs, I mean, I
think one way to think about it is like this:  Suppose
that what had happened is that Gonzales had gotten ten
paces, and Petitioner or Joseph had tackled him and
immediately snatched the drugs back.  I don't think this
Court or courts generally would expect the government to
charge two counts of possession with intent to
distribute for that brief period in which someone
snatches possession away and you get it.  That was
certainly what the prosecutor thought here, and it's
obviously not the issue in this case.
The only way that question comes into this
case is that Mr. Elwood is trying to say that the
prosecutor understood that -- that you didn't need
foreknowledge of the gun.  And that's not what the
prosecutor understood.  The prosecutor understood that
this offense could continue for at least some period
after in which the Confederates gave chase to -- to
reclaim the drugs.
And that may have been a wrong theory, but
no one below ever understood that you could be convicted
if you didn't know of the gun until your participation
ended.  That's why Petitioner never objected on that
ground, and that's why, of course, we submit that it
should be reviewed for plain error.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and you agree that
for aiding and abetting, you must -- the gun offense,
you must have knowledge that the gun is being carried by
the cohort.
MR. BASH:  Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You agree with that.
MR. BASH:  Carried or used, yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could the defendant here
have -- could the defendant here have been convicted of
possession of the ammunition on the theory that -- under
the instructions -- would the instructions have allowed
that conviction on the theory that the defendant aided
and abetted somebody else's possession of the
ammunition?
MR. BASH:  I don't think so, because the
judge never instructed that if you aid and abet, that's
is the equivalent of constructive possession of -- of
the bullets.  And, in fact, I mean, what constructive
possession means is that you have the ability to
exercise control over this -- over the ammunition.  So
it doesn't gel with his theory that, oh, I didn't know
about the gun until after the shots were fired.
I mean, I don't think anyone thought that
you could get a conviction because the shells were on
the ground or something and you could pick them up after
they were fired.  The obvious view was that he was --
the person who shot the gun -- and at minimum, I think
those convictions, because there were no aiding and
abetting instructions on them, show that he must have
known about the gun ahead of time if he could exercise,
at minimum, constructive possession over the ammunition
fired from --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what's the
point of charging him with possession of the gun and
possession of the bullets in the gun?  It would seem to
me that the proof would be pretty much the same.
MR. BASH:  The proof -- the proof was the
same in this case.  They didn't charge him with
possession of the gun.  They charged him with use or
carrying during and in relation to the drug trafficking
offense.  And then there were two counts of possession
of the ammunition, which were linked to his felony
status and his alien -- unlawful alien status.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess, then,
the question is:  What's the point of charging him with
possession of the bullets if you're not charging him
with possession of the gun?
MR. BASH:  It -- we could have charged him
with possession as a felon.  We didn't.  It's not
totally clear to me why we didn't.  But we certainly
could have charged him with being a felon in possession
of a firearm in this case.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Bash, you know, what
sticks in my craw a little bit about your position is
this:  Usually, we want punishments to -- two people and
they do very different things and they have very
different intents, we want them actually to be punished
differently.
And what you're suggesting is that there
is -- let's say a crime, two people are involved in it.
One person does almost everything.  You know, he does
90 percent of the stuff.  And the other person does just
a little thing, but something, you know, that goes to
the offense that helps facilitate the offense.  But it's
really pretty small compared to the overall crime.
And then in addition to that, that person
does not have really full-fledged intent, just has a
kind of knowledge that this other person with real
purpose of intent is going to bring a gun.
So -- so, you have a lesser act and a lesser
intent, and notwithstanding that, you're saying that the
person ought to be punished in the exact same way as his
confederate.
MR. BASH:  We are saying that.  I think
that -- that -- that gels with the historic law of
aiding and abetting, which, as Judge Friendly said in a
case we cite in our brief, Garguilo, assistance of even
slight moment counts.  And --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I guess what I would
have thought was that the actus reus can be very small,
but almost to compensate for that, you have to have
full-fledged intent.  You have to have a really kind of
purpose of -- a -- a purpose that the crime succeed as
opposed to just knowledge of -- of what will happen.
MR. BASH:  Justice Kagan, I don't think that
can be right for the examples I gave, paid accomplices
that don't have a stake or the person who lends the gun
to be a good guy.  And let me contrast that -- I never
got to this example -- with what a pure knowledge
standard would look like.
Suppose there was looting, and the defendant
breaks into the -- a store to facilitate his own entry
in the store to steal goods.  But he knows there's 20
people coming behind him, and he has now facilitated
their entry into the store, too.  That is not aiding and
abetting under our theory because he did not even bear
the intent to facilitate, by which we mean the intent to
make some step in another person's crime easier.  He
knew it would do that, but that was incidental to an
intent to facilitate his own crime.
So I do think the mens rea is significantly
ratcheted up from what a pure knowledge standard would
look like.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you agree that in
order to show aiding and abetting -- and I'll just quote
from a California case here -- that, "The aider and
abetter has to have knowledge of the criminal purpose of
the perpetrator and the intent to facilitate it"?
MR. BASH:  Yes.  I think what that
formulation masks is exactly what intent to facilitate
means, and I think that might be part of the
disagreement among the parties.  And what we say is that
it means an intent to make some step in what you know is
a crime that he intend -- the principal intends to do
easier.  And we think it's got to be that.
That's also the formulation in the
historical sources we cite at page 47 at Footnote 10 of
our brief.  It's either the intent to commit the crime
yourself or knowledge that the other person has that
intent.  And I don't see how it can be anything else.
I mean, if -- if you assist someone in a --
just to be a good person, not because you care if the
crime succeeds, and if you ask them in -- with the truth
serum, do you want the crime to succeed, you say, well,
I'm totally indifferent to the crime.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you -- would you
agree that the statement -- that the first part of the
instruction that the district court gave, "defendant
knew his cohort used a firearm," is inaccurate?  Is
incomplete?
MR. BASH:  Not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Potentially misleading?
MR. BASH:  In isolation, potentially
misleading.  I think in context, how reasonable jurors
would understand this and how the parties understood it,
because nobody raised an objection to this below, I
think they understood that your knowledge had to arise
before your completion --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You would --
MR. BASH:  -- of your participation in the
offense.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You would never --
if you got a call from the U.S. -- assistant U.S.
attorney in the field said, this is the instruction I'm
going to use, you would tell him, no, don't do that.
MR. BASH:  We -- we wouldn't.  But the
reason this Court has -- or the reason courts generally
have objection rules is when questions about particular
verb tenses and phrasings arise, the defendant or one of
the parties is supposed to actually object to that in
the district court.  That didn't happen here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I know you have
arguments about failure to object and harmless error.
But on the substance of it, you think the instruction --
you would never counsel someone to give that
instruction.
MR. BASH:  Well, I think as we said in the
brief, it would have been clearer to say "would use" or
something that -- that makes absolutely clear that you
required foreknowledge.  I think if the Court has
questions about this sort of case-specific issue along
with the forfeiture and waiver and harmless error and
plain error issues, it could do this, and this would be
a sensible result, it could clarify, one, facilitation
with respect to either conduct element is enough as far
as actus reus.  Two, the intent to facilitate means an
intent to make some step in that crime easier combined
with knowledge that the principal bears the intent to
complete the crime.  And then it could remand to the
court of appeals to say, sort out whether this
instruction was wrong, whether that objection was
forfeited, whether harmless error or plain error
concepts come in here.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why do you say --
you say in context, it was okay.  What -- what context?
MR. BASH:  The -- Justice Scalia, the
instruction -- or part of the same instruction, the
paragraph immediately before just mirrored --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's it?  Just that?  "In
order to aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is
necessary that the defendant willfully and knowingly
associated himself in some way with the crime."
MR. BASH:  Well, to help make the crime
succeed.  And I think a reasonable person reading that
would not think I helped make -- helped make the 924(c)
crime succeed if I didn't even know about the gun until
I was after doing -- I was done doing whatever I was
going to do.
And I also point the Court to page 194,
which makes clear that "knowingly," in that second part
of the instruction, is defined as voluntarily and
intentionally.  So you certainly had to intentionally
participate in the drug trafficking crime.  And that --
part of the context, as this Court has said, is also
just --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Knowing that a gun would
be used.  You had to intentionally participate knowing
that a gun would be used.
MR. BASH:  Basically a slight tweak, which
is knowing that the principal bore the intent to use a
gun.  Obviously, you can't know the future.  It's that
you know that the principal bore that intent, which is a
little bit different, but I think we're saying the same
thing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I don't see how
"make the crime succeed" helps you because you would say
the crime that he has to help make succeed is the
underlying drug offense, not the use of the firearm.
MR. BASH:  No, Mr. Chief Justice, we
wouldn't say that.  This umbrella instruction applied to
Count 1 and 2.  The crime you're help making succeed is
924(c).  What I was saying earlier was that, what does
it mean to help make a crime succeed?  It makes -- it
means intent to make one -- at least one step in that
crime easier, knowing the other person bore the intent
to do the crime.
And I think that's how we normally think
about it.  If there's an armed robbery, and you say,
well, I'll drive the getaway car, I think you would
naturally say in ordinary English you intended to help
make that crime succeed even if you didn't bear a
specific intent with respect to the gun.
I certainly think on -- you know, if this
had been objected to below, it might be a different
matter with Mr. Elwood, but he did not object to this
below.  He didn't -- he didn't raise this -- this
wording issue even in the court of appeals.  He raised a
sufficiency challenge with respect to foreknowledge.
But he -- even in his court of appeals brief, he didn't
say that the instructions in this case were wrong
because it said "used" versus "would use."
So I don't think the issue is properly here,
but I think it would be a sensible resolution if the
Court were to remand these case-specific issues after
clarifying the basic standard of aiding and abetting to
the court of appeals to work through the forfeiture and
waiver of harmless error and so forth.
If there are no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Elwood, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ELWOOD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
One point that I want to emphasize is a
point made by Justice Kagan, which is that traditionally
because the actus reus is relatively small for aiding
and abetting cases, that is exactly why courts have
adopted a standard of purposeful intent.  And they have
said that because the act of an accomplice tends to be
less harmful and tends to be more equivocal than that of
the principal, that they ordinarily require purposeful
intent.
And as Professor Wayne LaFave said, who
obviously doesn't have a stake in the case:  "Liability
has seldom been imposed on the basis of knowing
assistance.  The background rule is that it has to be
purposeful intent."
JUSTICE BREYER:  What cases should I look up
for that?
MR. ELWOOD:  I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That is to say, I thought
generally in the criminal law a person who commits an
illegal act is liable for the known consequences of that
act.  That is the general rule.  I can't think -- I
mean, people use all kinds of terminology, different
kinds of terminology, but I thought that's the basic
principle.
MR. ELWOOD:  The standard for accomplice
liability requires purposeful intent.  It's generally --
JUSTICE BREYER:  When you say "purposeful
intent," He didn't want it, but he knew it would happen.
MR. ELWOOD:  It was his purpose --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And moreover, he helped to
produce the occasion on which it would happen.
MR. ELWOOD:  It was his purpose for doing
it.  And the cases you can look at are Nye & Nissen --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well just tell me
where in the brief they are, or whatever's easier.
MR. ELWOOD:  I mean, Nye & Nissen, the --
Nye & Nissen, which is a case of this Court from 1949,
where the Court adopted the standard from the Learned
Hand case Peoni, that adopted the purposeful intent standard.
And Peoni is obviously a very important case as well.
But Hicks.  In Hicks, in 1893 this Court
reversed a conviction because the jury instruction did
not require proof of intent to encourage the crime.
JUSTICE BREYER:  They used the word "intent."
Some people used it in order to encompass the
situation --
MR. ELWOOD:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- of the known but
undesired consequence.
MR. ELWOOD:  Right.  But the Court went on
to say that action for any other purpose, even if with
the -- even if it had the effect of encouraging --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's language.  I am sure
you will find language.  I want really an instance where
the holding of the case is that a person who commits an
unlawful event -- action with knowledge that the other unlawful
action will occur is not liable for it.
MR. ELWOOD:  I would --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You know, blowing up the
carriage and you kill the maid, who you didn't want to
kill.  You are liable.
MR. ELWOOD:  I would point you --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Which one is it?
MR. ELWOOD:  I'm sorry to LaFave -- I'm
sorry, I don't have a case off the top of my head.  I
know that they state the principal.  But LaFave in
Chapter 13.2 collects cases and he makes the point there
that liability has seldom been imposed on the basis of
knowing assistance for aiders and abetters.  You have to
have purposeful intent --
JUSTICE BREYER:  LaFave.
MR. ELWOOD:  LaFave, Wayne LaFave.
JUSTICE BREYER:  LaFave.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, do you have
anything for us on Rule 30?
MR. ELWOOD:  You know, on Rule 30, I won't
pretend that it was a model of clarity in preserving the
error about after-arising intent.  But I will say that
there is no contest.  I mean, that is to us just a sign
of how messed up the jury instructions are.  But we did
preserve, we say, our objection both with respect to the
absence of facilitating the right offense, and the
intent to commit the crime as opposed to knowledge that
the gun would be used.  And so --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How did you preserve
that objection?
MR. ELWOOD:  With respect to intent, by
objecting to their instruction on the basis that it
didn't include intentional facilitation of the 924(c)
offense.
And if there are no further questions, we
will rely on our submission.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
