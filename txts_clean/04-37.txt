ORAL ARGUMENT OF WELLON B. POE, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. POE: Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please
the Court:
This case today involves a conflict between
Oklahoma's semi-closed primary law and a rule adopted by
the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma which, contrary to that
State law, would allow the Libertarian Party to open its
primary elections not just to independent voters, but also
voters registered as members of other political parties.
The Oklahoma primary system simply requires that
a person who is registered as a member of that party may
only vote in that political party's primaries. If the
voter desires to vote in another party's primary, all that
voter must do is, within a reasonable time before the
elections, primary elections, approximately 7 to 8 weeks,
is disaffiliate from that first party and then reaffiliate
as a member of that second party, or if the parties so
chose to allow independents, he may registered as an
independent in order to vote in that primary.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, of course, I guess from
the standpoint of the Libertarian Party, it's kind of a
problem because a voter who wants to disaffiliate under
Oklahoma law with their -- their prior registration have
to do it basically 8 weeks ahead, at which time they don't
know if the Libertarian Party will even qualify for having
a primary. I mean, it just gives them a very impossibly
short window. If the time were reasonable, that might be
a different picture, but isn't that kind of burdensome?
MR. POE: Well, Your Honor, the practicality of
that matter is -- is that generally the parties are
notified 10 days/2 weeks in advance of the registration
deadline that they are being -- if -- being recognized as
a political party. Of course -- and that's if that party
has waited until the very last minute by statute in which
to turn in their petitions and try to get recognized. Of
course, those petitions could be turned in earlier, which
would allow them more time to do so. But the practicality
of the -- of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If they're turned in earlier,
will they -- will they be ruled on earlier?
MR. POE: Yes, Your Honor. The Oklahoma statute
requires that the election board take a -- has 30 days, a
maximum of 30 days, in which to review the petitions,
verify the number of signatures and the authenticity of
those signatures, and then make a decision on whether to
recognize or not recognize the political party.
JUSTICE BREYER: I guess there's a difference
here between the interest of a small party and a large
one. A small party would like, if there is a deadline, to
be as close to the election as possible so voters have a
chance to get fed up with the two big parties.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: That's their chance. A big
party would like it to be further away because then they
can plan how their election campaign is going to be.
Has any of this been litigated below?
MR. POE: No, Your Honor. The -- the only
question that has really been litigated below is whether
section 1-104, which is the semi-closed primary law, is
burdensome on the association rights of the Libertarians.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In line -- in line with
Justice Breyer's question, does the State of Oklahoma have
an interest in insulating major parties from competition
for members?
MR. POE: Not from insulating them from
competition, Your Honor, but the State of Oklahoma does
have -- it has a closed primary system. It has -- it has
an interest. And this Court has found that interest, as
recently as in Timmons, that it does have an interest in a
stable political system, which may be a two-party system.
As long as --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you have a -- the State has
an interest in protecting major parties from losing their
members and thereby weakening the two-party system by
benefiting a third party. I thought that's contrary to
the whole thrust of our holding in cases such as Anderson
and Celebreeze where third parties are entitled to special
protection under the First Amendment.
MR. POE: Well, Your Honor, since that time in
Anderson and as Timmons and other cases cite, if the
regulation is a neutral, nondiscriminatory regulation,
then it is a proper regulation as far as it is applied to
all the parties.
In regards to the requirement of registration,
change of voter registration, all of those are applied
equally across any -- any party, whether it be the
Libertarian Party, the Democratic Party, Republican Party,
or any other party which may be recognized at that time in
the State of Oklahoma.
And back to Justice Breyer's comments, the
period of 7 to 8 weeks prior to a voting -- to a primary
election is actually a very short time as compared, for
example, to Rosario which this Court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, even in presidential
elections, most people don't get interested until 4 or 5
weeks before the election. Everybody knows that.
MR. POE: Well, Your Honor, we -- this is not
the presidential primaries of which we're talking about.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm saying even in a
presidential primary. If they're local races, it -- it
takes longer. The public just tunes out until the last --
last couple weeks.
MR. POE: Well, the statutes in this -- or the
sites or the -- the elections themselves are close in
time, and -- and the statutes involving the petitioning
have all been looked at as -- as courts and have been
found that this is a close enough connection to the time
of the elections, that that time frame of petitioning and
getting the requirements for -- for petitions and the
State recognizing the political party all fit comfortably
within the confines of -- of constitutionality.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Poe, the -- the district
court in this case rejected all grounds except one. It
rejected the raiding and swamping. It said that's what
the Libertarians want to expose themselves to. It's not
for a State to be paternalistic to protect them against
their own bad choices. But it said this request is
damaging to the majority parties, to the major parties,
because it poaches on their members. But there is not in
this litigation any major party that's complaining about
that. So if that is the rationale that the district court
went on, can this Court possibly uphold it when there is
nobody, as far as we know -- they haven't even come into
this case at this level, filing a friend of the Court
brief.
MR. POE: Yes, Your Honor. This Court can find
-- first of all, that the local Democratic and Republican
Parties were not named in -- in the action, and as to why
they were not in the action in lower courts I do not know.
But the State has its interests and has to protect those
interests whether those parties are involved in litigation
or not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, when you -- would you
say that the rationale on which the district court
rejected the Libertarian Party's claim was unsatisfactory?
MR. POE: No, Your Honor. Under Monroe before
this Court, I think the Court was looking to the
potential, the possibility, of course. And as to the fact
pattern we had at the trial court, it was a very minor
party wanting to -- or effectively poach voters from the
two major parties.
But you have to look at the entire statutory
scheme and not just how it would apply. It could be
applied by the Democrats or the Republicans.
But also more importantly, in Monroe this Court
clearly stated that a State does not have to wait until it
sees actual damage to its political or electoral system to
make reasonable decisions. In fact, this Court says the
States should have the foresight to make those reasonable
determinations in an effort to prevent those -- those
potential evils from occurring if the likelihood of -- of
that is there.
And the district court made very --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Poe, I -- I -- here I am.
MR. POE: Excuse me, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that if -- if I were
the party chairman of the Republican or Democratic Party,
I'm -- I might have defended your -- your State system if
I had been named as a party, but if I were not named as a
party, I'm not sure that I wouldn't -- I wouldn't decline
to come in as an amicus, even though I'm interested in the
outcome simply because I don't want to alienate my
Republican members by depriving them of the freedom, if
they want to do it, to go vote. You know, it makes you
look sort of parsimonious, doesn't it, when you tell your
Republican members, I don't want you to vote in the
Libertarian primaries? I -- I don't think we can say that
it doesn't hurt the Republican Party or the -- or the
Democratic Party simply because they hadn't filed an
amicus brief.
MR. POE: I would agree, Your Honor. I -- I
think the -- the fact that they're not there -- here the
Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They are, after all,
politicians, aren't they?
(Laughter.)
MR. POE: And they do like to keep their party
members as happy as they can.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Poe, may I just focus in
on exactly what the injury is? Is the injury that they
vote with the Libertarians or that they don't vote with
their own party?
MR. POE: The -- the injury is twofold, Your
Honor. And -- and first, it is the fact that by them not
voting in the primary to which they have associated -- and
that is registering as a Republican or a Democrat -- if
they go to the polling place and at the last minute decide
to go and vote in the Libertarian Party primary, their
decision not to vote in the Republican primaries, when
candidates have been trying to -- to use voter lists
trying to get to their party members to vote --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But wouldn't it be precisely
the same injury if they just didn't like the Republican
candidate in that particular election, decided to stay
home?
MR. POE: Well, if they had already made the
decision to stay home, then they would not be voting for
the candidate, but they would also not be voting in
another party's primary.
JUSTICE STEVENS: How -- how are they hurt by
the fact that rather than staying home, they decide to
cast a vote for a minority party candidate?
MR. POE: Well, the party is here because it has
the -- the possibility, for those who are not voting, of
changing the elections of the candidates. And I think
also by --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it's very unlikely if
it's a party that is -- gets the small vote that this
party gets. But you -- no matter how small the vote is,
you still find the injury to the major parties because
they voted for the Libertarians or because they didn't
vote at all?
MR. POE: Well, because they voted either way of
voting -- or for voting in the Libertarians and -- and not
voting, they have changed and possibly have changed,
especially when they went to the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any evidence on the
question whether the -- the support for the major party
candidate is any smaller than it would have been if there
had been no Libertarian Party at all?
MR. POE: There -- there's nothing in the record
that supports any of that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and a very similar
question. Is there anything in the record that indicates
that those who would vote in the Libertarian primary are
the stay-at-home Republicans or the Republicans who would
otherwise have voted in the Republican primary?
MR. POE: There -- there is nothing in the
record. There was no type of polling. There was some --
some expert testimony as to the potential reasons for
people voting in a Libertarian primary such as purposeful
intent to do harm to Libertarians or walking in intending
to vote --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But that -- I mean, the
Libertarians are happy to have -- take that risk.
MR. POE: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: It seems to me if we don't know
whether the -- the Republicans who are going to migrate to
the primary are stay-at-homes or Republican voters, the
State has no basis even to say whether in fact the harm
it's trying to prevent is going to be affected one way or
the other by its rule.
MR. POE: Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, there
-- there is a context or -- there is belief that it will
harm. And there's been no polling in this action, and
there's no -- there was only one other State that has a
open -- what we have termed in this litigation as a -- a
semi-open primary. And there's no data that has
effectively come out of their one primary that says why
people are not voting, why they're voting in one primary
or not or the effects of that. I can give you --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Poe, I -- I -- why do you
rely only upon the damage to the Republican and Democratic
Parties? I frankly don't care much about that, but I
might care a whole lot about damage to -- to Oklahoma's
system of election.
Why do you allow party designations? I suppose
it is because you want people to know that there are
candidates who are associated with particular political
views. And to allow a party to, in effect, come in and
say, we don't have any particular political views, we --
we just want to nominate, you know, whoever the most
people want to nominate, that just destroys the whole
purpose of -- of your system of allowing people to run
under a party label. What's the use of a party label?
MR. POE: And -- and, Your Honor, we -- we
provided that information and those interests to -- to the
district court. And those are interests the State has.
It is if a party is running as a party and if the State --
there -- there may be an interest in it. I'm not sure --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- if it's running as a
party, it should run somebody who -- who shares the views
of the people in that party, which is somebody who is
nominated by -- by the people in that party, or at least
those people, joined by others who are not affiliated with
another party. That seems to me to make a lot of sense.
And it seems to me to destroy that system if --
if you say, hey, we're -- you know, we -- we're going to
allow the Libertarian Party to say, you know, we don't
have any real views. We're just going to -- we want to
nominate somebody that most people like. So let the
Republicans come in, the Democrats come in. The only
thing we want is to win. We don't really care.
MR. POE: That -- that is the premise, of
course, of the voter registration.
And -- and that goes back to another -- an
adverse effect on the State and the State's political
system is this Court has recognized -- it recognized it as
recently as Jones and it has recognized in other cases --
that there is a -- a party labeling or a party
identification that voters use in a general election. And
if the poaching of members have changed the -- any of
those party -- those messages from that party, then the
reliance is going to be misplaced by those party members
when they go. They go to vote for a Democrat. They see
the D or the R or the L.
And more importantly, in this case we're not
talking just about the Libertarian Party, the effect of
the Libertarian Party. It could very well the effects on
all of the political parties. In fact, that effect could
happen if the Democrats wanted to open theirs up and run
that effect on the Libertarian Party.
Another reason, especially that is specific to
Oklahoma, to help prevent party factionalism and party
splintering. In Oklahoma, when a new party is recognized,
a -- a potential candidate has the opportunity within 15
days of the party being recognized of changing his voter
registration. That can even be outside the parameters of
section 4-119.
In that instance, there is the potential and I
think the probability of this occurring is that -- let's
say there are four or five candidates who have announced
for the Republican nomination if they want to get their
nomination, and one of them decides I don't want to
compete against those others. A new party comes in. He
is excused from the 6-month disaffiliation requirement.
Within those 15 days, he can change to the Libertarian
Party in hopes of getting that nomination, get the party
support and the party structure. By that happening, you
then incur -- by allowing this party-option primary, you
then -- that would promote party splintering, party
factionalism. And the manner of that individual going to
the Libertarian Party the day of the election without any
prior registration -- those Republicans who may have
supported him leave the Republican Party and start to
choose that. That's splintering that this Court has
specifically said is not only a legitimate, important
State interest but is also a compelling State interest to
effect.
Poaching has the same effect as raiding. It is
a little different how it gets there, but it has the same
effect. And raiding has been determined to be even a
compelling State interest in this Court.
I would like to reserve the rest of my time.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's fine.
Mr. Schaerr.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR
ON BEHALF OF SOUTH DAKOTA, ET AL.,
AS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. SCHAERR: Justice Stevens, and may it please
the Court:
In the decision below, the Tenth Circuit stuck
-- struck down an election rule that has been adopted by
nearly half the States pursuant to their authority under
Article I, section 4 to prescribe the manner of holding
elections. In so doing, the Tenth Circuit in our view
made three fundamental errors that I'd like to address
briefly.
The first was the Tenth Circuit's per se
approach to determining whether the alleged burdens here
are severe. That's an extremely important issue, of
course, because to our knowledge, this Court has never
invalidated a State election regulation under the First
Amendment without first finding that the burden at issue
was severe. But instead of looking at that issue closely,
the Tenth Circuit, at page 15 of its decision, simply
assumed that a severe burden necessarily arises from any
regulation that, quote, restricts the options of parties
seeking to define the scope of their associational rights.
Now, one would have thought that it's for courts
to determine the scope of a -- of a party's associational
rights rather than -- than the party itself. But in all
events, that was the sum total of the Tenth Circuit's
analysis on the -- on the question of severe burden.
Now, the respondents cite that finding, but they
-- they make no attempt to defend that approach. They
argue instead that the burden here is severe because, at
bottom, Oklahoma requires a Republican or Democrat,
wishing to vote in the LPO primary, to -- to disaffiliate
from the party 2 months in advance. But that burden is no
more severe than others that this Court has found
constitutionally acceptable.
The burden on voters, for example, is less
severe than the burden this found -- this Court found
acceptable in Rosario, which was a -- a requirement, as
Mr. Poe mentioned, that voters, wishing to vote in a -- in
a party's primary, register as a member of that party some
to 11 months in advance.
The burden on the party is also less severe than
a burden that this Court found acceptable in Burdick which
is that a party wishing to qualify for a primary ballot
gather the necessary signatures, in that case 1 percent of
the voting population, 5 months before the primary. It's
months here.
And it's also similar to a burden that all the
members of this Court found acceptable in Burdick, which
was -- which was a requirement that a candidate wishing to
run on a nonpartisan primary ballot collect the necessary
signatures about 2 months before the primary.
And the message of these decisions -- and I
think it's fair to say the holding in Burdick -- is that
requiring participants in elections to take action a few
months sooner or a few weeks sooner than they might prefer
does not amount to a severe burden. And that's the only
real burden here. The LPO has to --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I guess the one other
concern would be the timing in Oklahoma is such that the
-- the Republican or Democrat who wants to disaffiliate in
order to vote with the Libertarians has to do so at a time
before the State has decided whether to allow the
Libertarian Party on the ballot. So, you know, it
probably isn't burdensome to -- in principle, to have some
disaffiliation requirement, but does the State have to
allow enough time so that the decision can be made with
knowledge of whether the Libertarians are going to be on
the ballot?
MR. SCHAERR: Justice O'Connor, I -- I think
that's really up to the party. And I -- and I think that
gets back to my point about Burdick. Yes, there is a
deadline and if the LPO --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It just seemed to me that it
might be more burdensome on the voter in that situation.
MR. SCHAERR: Yes, I -- I think that's true, but
again, the burden on the voter depends on what the LPO
does. If the LPO marshals its resources, gets -- gets its
message out, determines who its candidates are going to be
or who its potential candidates are going to be in advance
of the filing deadline and in advance of the deadline for
filing a petition to become a recognized party, then the
voter will have ample time to make a decision. It's
really only if the LPO procrastinates that the voter is
put in that position. It's not really a function of the
-- of the State law.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me just ask you to look at
the other side of the equation. However we assess the
burden, we're assessing it in relation to the State's
interest. What is your best statement of the State's
interest here that you think is defensible?
MR. SCHAERR: Well, I think -- I think the
State's interest is what the district court found it to
be, and I think the -- the district court actually found
two interests, not just one. It found an interest in
avoiding poaching and an interest in promoting party
loyalty along the lines that Justice Scalia mentioned
earlier.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do -- do you think the -- the
poaching argument stands up on any -- any empirical basis?
MR. SCHAERR: I do. And in fact, the -- the
district court at -- at page 49 --
JUSTICE SOUTER: May -- let me just add quickly.
I -- I realize, of course, there's going to be some
movement of voters, but do we have any idea whether the
voters who are moving are the ones who would otherwise
have stayed at home anyway and done nothing, merely
nominal Republicans as opposed to active Republicans?
MR. SCHAERR: Yes. We -- we do have answer to
that. That is implicit, first of all, in the district
court's finding that poaching would, in fact, made -- make
a difference in the -- in the outcomes of the elections.
He -- he made that finding very clearly on -- on page
--
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he found that the numbers
are such that they could, but did he find -- and I'm not
sure of this. Did he find that the actual people who
migrated would otherwise have voted differently so that in
fact it made a difference?
MR. SCHAERR: That is implicit in his finding.
He said the institution -- this is again on page 49. The
institution of a party-option open primary format in
Oklahoma, as sought by the plaintiffs, would likely affect
the outcome of some primary elections. That -- implicit
in that is the view that there -- there would be some
voting Republicans and voting Democrats that would be
moving to the LPO, not just the nonvoting Democrats and
Republicans.
Now --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there a basis in the
record for making that finding?
MR. SCHAERR: Yes. Mr. Darcy's testimony, which
I believe appears at -- at page 63 of the joint appendix,
in that -- in that general area, anyway.
Now, poaching -- poaching is a concern and --
and a legitimate and important concern to the States for
three important reasons. I -- I might mention that in
Tashjian this Court mentioned in footnote 13 that a --
that an open primary could have disorganization effects on
the other parties, and poaching is one of those, as the
district court found. And -- and it's a concern for three
independent reasons.
First of all, the State has an interest in
preventing poaching because that helps protect parties
from spurned candidate candidacies which was one of the --
the Court in Tashjian identified Storer and Rosario as
examples of that. And -- and the -- the semi-closed
primary protects parties against that. For example, if a
candidate for the Democratic nomination felt that she
wasn't getting enough support from the party leadership
before the primary, she might form or join another party
and then try to take -- take her supporters with her into
that other party. And although Oklahoma allows the
candidate to switch parties in that circumstance, the --
the semi-closed primary and the 7-week period or 7- or 8-
week period, standoff period, if you will -- that period
protects the party from having its voters poached as a
result of a -- of a spurned candidate joining another
party.
The second reason that poaching is a significant
concern is that -- is that it can lead to efforts,
strategic efforts by -- by other parties to influence the
outcome of another party's primary. For example, suppose
we're in California in 2002 a few days before the
gubernatorial primaries there. The Democrats have already
decided that their incumbent, Governor Davis, will be
nominated, so they're looking ahead to the general
election. And they see two possible Republican
candidates, Reardon and Simon, to pull two names out of a
hat. And they conclude that -- that they have a better
chance of beating Simon than they have of beating Reardon.
Well, what can they do to affect the -- the outcome of the
Republican race?
One possibility, if the Republican primary is
open, is to raid it by having some Democrat switch
registration and go vote for Simon. And of course, the
Court has said repeatedly that States have an important
interest in -- in preventing that kind of behavior.
The other possibility is for the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And that's not permitted in
Oklahoma, is it? That kind of behavior is not permitted
in Oklahoma.
MR. SCHAERR: That's correct.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. SCHAERR: That's correct.
And the other possibility, though, is for the
Democrats to open their primary and to lure some of the --
some of the Reardon voters out of the Republican primary
through targeted advertising or direct appeals from the
candidate or something like that.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, neither of the major
parties has done that in Oklahoma, has it?
MR. SCHAERR: Not that I'm aware of, but -- but
it is -- but it is a plausible concern that a legislature
would have. And as Justice Scalia said, these --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the question is whether
when a minor party like the Libertarians do it, is -- is
it going to have that effect.
MR. SCHAERR: Well, there -- there's another
scenario for -- in the California example, for example.
Take -- assume that the Democrats, instead of opening up
their own primary to Republicans, they strike a deal with
the Green Party such that the Green Party makes an effort
to peel off the Reardon voters out of the Republican
primary voting pool in California. That --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the cost of that deal
would -- they'd also run the risk the Democrats would --
would migrate also if they made that deal.
MR. SCHAERR: It depends on how they ran -- ran
the campaign.
In all events, it's a -- it's a plausible
scenario and -- and one that the State is entitled to
respond to before it -- before it actually happens.
Now, the -- the third reason that poaching is a
problem is that --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I apologize for taking your
time with a question, but I'm afraid your time is up.
MR. SCHAERR: Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
Mr. Linger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. LINGER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LINGER: Justice Stevens, may it please the
Court:
The integrity of a political party should be
defined by the political party and not by the State.
The State interest that they have asserted here
and alleged is to prevent against draining, and draining
the State has defined as the inverse of raiding. Now,
raiding, of course, is the State preventing and keeping
out of a political party disloyal voters of another party
coming in for a purpose to hurt that party. Now, if
draining is inverse raiding, then the State is saying that
it has an interest in keeping in to a political party
disloyal voters. So the State is asserting and is at
cross purposes that it has an interest to both keep out
disloyal voters from a political party's primary and at
the same time keep in disloyal voters.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why is that inconsistent?
Because I mean, you're -- you're basically advocating that
the Constitution requires Alaska's rule, and I thought
that -- we got briefs on that, I think, in -- in the
previous case and a lot of other parties thought Alaska's
rule was not a wise rule, though that's up to Alaska. But
to think that the Constitution requires that is
surprising.
The interest they assert is just the one you
said --
MR. LINGER: And --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- that the Republicans, in
order to have their party work, have to be able to plan a
campaign for a stable group of voters. They have to know,
roughly, who is in their party, let's say, a week before
or 2 weeks before, some period of time before. And that's
the interest that Oklahoma is asserting. It has nothing
to do with you. It has do with -- and it has zero to do
with you if you had a rule for minor parties, frankly.
But if you can't get a rule for minor parties, special,
then you have to take it seriously I think.
MR. LINGER: Most States --
JUSTICE BREYER: What's your answer? What do
you respond --
MR. LINGER: Justice Breyer, most States have a
rule for minor parties. They don't treat, like Oklahoma
does, you're either a party or you're a nothing.
JUSTICE BREYER: The States do but to say that
the Constitution -- and I'm asking. You see, I'm not --
but I -- if I could figure out how in the Constitution you
had a special rule for minor parties, the interest that
they're asserting has very little to do with it. But I
don't see how you can have a constitutional rule that
would forbid -- allow you to open and drain, but wouldn't
allow the Dems to do the same as they've done in Alaska.
MR. LINGER: I think in -- in Alaska, of course,
right now there is a party option where all the parties
but the Republicans have opened the primary. They have a
blanket primary. The Republicans haven't and the
Republicans, of course, in Alaska happen to be the
dominant party. There seems to be a pattern in these
cases --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, because they say -- what
they're thinking, I take it -- I don't know what they're
really thinking, but I imagine they could be thinking, no,
we don't want to open our primary. We'll run the risk
that our voters go over and vote for the Dems and like it
there and stay. We'll run that risk, but we don't want
them coming and raiding us. We think that's the bigger
risk.
MR. LINGER: And -- and that --
JUSTICE BREYER: And how can the Constitution
tell them that they can't make that judgment? That's
what's bothering me.
MR. LINGER: I don't think the -- I think the
Constitution -- and the Court has recognized that it is
legitimate to protect against raiding because we can all
suppose how disloyal voters coming into a party could hurt
it. But how about disloyal voters leaving a party?
Because these voters that would come in and vote in the
Libertarian --
JUSTICE BREYER: Go back to my interest, the one
I asserted --
MR. LINGER: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- which isn't that. It is the
interest in the Republican Party in Alaska saying to
itself we do not want our voters to go leave and vote for
the Democrats because we want a stable body of people 3 or
weeks before the election for whom we can plan. We
don't want to open ours because we don't want the raiding.
We want to keep --
MR. LINGER: And, Justice Breyer, that sort of
First Amendment view of your voters shows that the party
thinks that they own the voters. We hear this language
where the party is contributing voters or they're being
poached or it's a donor party. That shows a certain view
of the party and what they --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It's not an ownership,
but you have a period of time. So you focus on the period
of time. They're saying, of course, up to X period of
time, they take their choice. Is this a fake thing, a
fake reason, the need to have a stable group of people for
whom you plan your campaigns? Now, is that a hoax or is
it flimsy or is it serious? What do you think?
MR. LINGER: I -- I think it is flimsy and I'll
tell you why because I think paternalistically the State
of Oklahoma is way off or the Republican Party, if they
thought that way in Alaska, would be off. If you really
think about it, a party, particularly at the general
election, wants its loyal voters to get to the poll.
Actually this would be a benefit to the Republican and
Democratic Parties in Oklahoma or the Republican Party in
Alaska because it allow them to find out which of their
voters had voted in their primary and which had defected
to another party. When they're sending out mailers or
doing phone banks or driving people to the polls, they're
going to want to take their loyal voters. So this will
actually serve to help them to identify some of their
voters who aren't loyal, and they won't want to bring them
in. So I'm saying that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the State -- the State
of Oklahoma doesn't want your party raided. And -- and
you say we don't care if we're raided. Come raid us. All
we want to do is win. It seems to me it -- it -- you
cannot apply the -- the maxim, volenti non fit injuria.
Oklahoma is saying to your party, you can't
welcome raiding. We don't want your party to be raided
whether you like it or not because that's what a party
system is. We've set up these elections that -- that have
party primaries and party systems on the assumption that
each party is going to have a certain -- a certain belief,
a certain philosophy, and to allow your candidate to be
elected by everybody simply destroys that system. Why is
that -- why is that so unreasonable that it's
unconstitutional?
MR. LINGER: Because it's -- it's not practical
on what happens. As Justice O'Connor pointed out in her
questions, there is such a limited time. The
Libertarians, as shown in the record in this case, have
never and continually do not have the time to build up a
voter pool. They have their supporters spread out among a
number of political affiliations because there's such a
little amount of time that you can register as a
Libertarian, unlike the vast majority of States.
I don't think anyone has ever accused the
Libertarian Party of not having a set philosophy on what
they stand for.
But the fact of the matter, this Court itself
has expressed skepticism about whether even party raiding
ever exists. People don't go out generally to vote
because they want to pick someone who's a bad candidate.
They want to vote for someone they feel proud of who
expresses their views. The people that the Libertarians
would appeal to would be Republicans and Democrats who
either weren't going to vote in their primary or those who
were very Libertarian oriented or people who would be
Libertarians if they had more opportunity under the law to
register as Libertarians. They're, in effect, marooned --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Weren't those --
MR. LINGER: -- over these other affiliations.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- weren't those who would like
to nominate the Libertarian candidate who would attract
the most people from the other large party? Right?
MR. LINGER: Who would they attract? They would
attract Libertarian-oriented people who would be drawn by
their philosophy because the Libertarian Party, as with
most minor parties, is an ideological party. They take
positions oftentimes ignored by the major parties, and
that is one of the reasons that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but the candidate
mostly to attract people from one of the major parties is
the candidate that is -- is more likely to water down the
pure Libertarian message and be closer to the message of
the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. And --
and --
MR. LINGER: If you can tell --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- people who come into your
primary may want to elect such a candidate so that the
Libertarian Party will be strengthened and draw votes away
from the other majority --
MR. LINGER: Of course, this Court, I think, has
recognized that raiding is not a legitimate concern for
the State that overcomes a party that would open up. And
that's what the district court so held. We go into the
inverse of draining and talk about the effect it would
have on the Republicans and Democratic Parties. I think
the -- the district court said several times in its
opinion that the results would be highly speculative. But
I say that the results would probably be to the benefit
because it would ensure major parties that they got a
nominee who was picked by loyal supporters of the party,
and what would be drained off would be disloyal supporters
who would rather be doing something else.
And that, of course, is the essence of
competition. We should not be worrying about protecting
the major parties from competition for ideals. This is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I understand your brief to
say that this constitutional rule that you are seeking
would be just for the minority party? I think you said in
your brief it doesn't follow like the night the day that
because the Libertarians must be allowed to do this by the
Constitution, therefore the Democrats and Republicans must
also have the option to invite anyone into their
primaries.
MR. LINGER: The finding of the Tenth Circuit
was, of course, that it applied to these plaintiffs under
these particular facts. And I think that's one thing to
remember, how cautious and conservative this Court and the
First Circuit in Cool Moose were. They didn't make a
broad-based rule, and I don't interpret this decision and
I don't interpret the teaching of this Court in footnote
in Tashjian is that we should come down and make some
bright line rule that's always going to say we have to
have a party-option open primary or not. We need to look
at the factors. I think there are very few States that
this would even apply to because, as we know, 21 States
don't even have political primary registration.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What facts? We -- we have to
evaluate it on the basis of each election? What is a
State legislator supposed to do when he votes for a -- an
election system? He's going to flip a coin trying to
figure out what the fact situation will be when this --
when this system finally gets before a court? Surely that
-- that can't be the test.
MR. LINGER: I do -- I do ask that the State
legislatures think about what they're doing. And as I
demonstrated --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But you -- you want them
to think and you want to leave the door open to their
making a distinction for these purposes between the major
parties and the minor parties, and I can't think of
anything more intrusive into the political process than
that. Coming from a Libertarian, I -- I get a sense that
I must misunderstand you, but I don't know where it is.
(Laughter.)
MR. LINGER: I'm saying that I -- I don't -- I
don't think courts should ever go out and look for cases
in advance. We look at the case that is --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but we are -- we have got
to look around the corner.
MR. LINGER: -- about the effects.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and if you're issuing
the invitation to come up with a different rule for
Republicans and Democrats and Libertarians, I think you're
asking for trouble and we would be asking for trouble if
we accepted that invitation.
MR. LINGER: No. I'm -- and as I said before, I
think the political party should be the one that defines
its integrity --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then -- then if you say that --
I want you to just respond in detail to the questions that
I think Justice Scalia and Justice Souter were asking, as
I understand it, putting it dramatically, that if you win
this case, Alaska's system becomes the Constitution of the
United States. Now, that I know you think is not so, and
I want to know why.
MR. LINGER: Because, number one, first, let's
eliminate the 21 States that do not have political party
registration. They would not -- in fact, the -- the
problem that we're worried about here, draining, and --
and the problem is going to happen simply because people
in those States, like President Bush's Texas, are free
from election to election to go to any primary they
want to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the same as election
system -- that's the same as Alaska's system. Right? I
mean, it boils down to the same thing. It boils down to
an open primary, doesn't it?
MR. LINGER: Justice Scalia, I respectfully
disagree because Alaska, unlike Texas, has political party
registration. Also, they have a party option. And most
States that have political party registration, in fact,
have a sort of two-tier system where they recognize it
would be discriminatory to treat major parties and small
political parties the same. Most of them like, for
example, the amici States here of New Mexico, Maryland,
they have political conventions for their -- they
recognize that that is something that shouldn't be applied
to the smaller parties.
But Oklahoma, of course, mandates primaries.
The Libertarians of Oklahoma are forced to have primaries.
They're forced to live under what is the most restrictive
ballot access and ballot retention laws, which limits the
amount of time they could be on the ballot.
The voter registration laws, as was cited in the
record of this case, as the trial judge found, of the 29
States that have political party registration, essentially
of them have -- they have free and open registration.
There are very few that limit things across the board like
Oklahoma does, and that's what makes this case unique.
And I think the footnote 13 in Tashjian talked
about looking at the particular facts and circumstances.
I think this case gives the Court an opportunity to fully
expand on that footnote, the full footnote, of course, as
I cited in the brief for the respondents, and that is to
say that all these are factors when you're analyzing any
State. Is -- does it have political party registration?
Does it mandate primaries for even the little parties?
How much time is available to change your registration as
new parties come up?
The New -- State of New Hampshire, of course,
has found a way to deal with this problem, which Oklahoma
hasn't, which is that they allow new parties that are just
recognized. Where many voters didn't have the opportunity
to register in that party, they have an open primary.
That's one way to deal with it.
But the point is Oklahoma didn't even think
about that. As we pointed out in our brief, the sore
loser provision where you have to be affiliated with a
party for 6 months -- the legislature -- when the first
time the Libertarians got on the ballot 25 years ago, they
didn't even realize that there was no way you could be
affiliated with a party for 6 months because you couldn't
register with it.
And the law and the workings of all these
registration laws in Oklahoma, because they are so
restrictive, prevent the Libertarian Party to get in the
position that the major parties have because they simply
can't get their people registered and stay registered with
the Libertarian Party because they're constantly being
purged and they're -- the people are frustrated.
JUSTICE BREYER: Would there be a way --
suppose, for hypothetical purposes, the Court were to say
-- you got a ruling that said there is no rule in the
Constitution that forbids a State, as a general matter, to
forbid this cross registration, this jumping, for a
reasonable time. But a reasonable time has to take into
account the interests of minor as well as major parties.
Now are you foreclosed because of the circumstances of
this case from litigating whether 8 weeks is a reasonable
time and whether the disjunct between the period where you
become a party and that 8 weeks is unreasonable in the
circumstances or other specific things that you say work
to the disadvantage of the Libertarians?
MR. LINGER: I think that's something
reasonable, but in this case it is unreasonable because
you simply don't have the opportunity to register.
Remember this --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your case was you
want to appeal to people who don't want to register as
Libertarians and don't even want to be independent. You
want to appeal to people who are and want to be members of
the Republican or Democratic Party but have Libertarian
leanings, but they don't want to give up their party
affiliation.
MR. LINGER: That -- that is part of the appeal.
There are obviously some people simply because of family
tradition or it may help them with their job or because
the Libertarians are controversial, some people may want
to keep it quiet and don't formally affiliate other than
they might wish to vote. But our appeal and request was
not simply those people but to many people, the vast
majority of Oklahomans who never vote --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The last category could --
could register as independents. I mean, if they're
ashamed of -- of the L word, they -- they could just
register as independents. Right?
MR. LINGER: A person can do that, yes. And, of
course, independents are growing. I think, as you know --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that you could do
right now, and you say that's not enough. We want people
who are members of other parties and don't want to change
their party affiliation.
MR. LINGER: We would like -- first, when you
have competition in ideals and in politics, it's always a
continuing process, and they're hoping to win all these
people over. They don't want these people to stay in
other political parties, but they are opening it up
because they have such a limited period of time in
Oklahoma when people can formally affiliate with the
Libertarian Party or, for that matter, any newly
recognized party.
Think of it this way. When counsel was talking
about the Rosario case where you -- the -- the State was
allowed to have 8 to 11 months and the Court found that
was acceptable to change your registration or the older
case of Kusper v. Pontikes where the Court found that 23
months in -- in advance to change your affiliation was too
much, in Oklahoma, whether it's 23 months before the newly
affiliate party gets recognized or 8 to 11 months, you
can't register with that party. So if it was unreasonable
in Kusper v. Pontikes but was reasonable in Rosario, the
point is under either of those time periods, in Oklahoma
you can't register with a newly recognized political
party. So how can that be reasonable?
The Libertarians do not have the opportunity.
Newly recognized parties under Oklahoma law do not have
the opportunity to get their people in in time, to the
extent they could, as demonstrated in the record by States
of similar population like Kansas and Arizona and, as I
noted in the brief, Oregon where there are substantially
more --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What did -- what did you seek
in this action? What did you seek in this action? Did --
did you seek just more time to -- to register? I -- I
thought you -- you sought to overturn the -- the system
entirely and -- I mean, maybe you asked for too much.
MR. LINGER: As -- as to the Libertarians, we
asked that we have a party-option open primary, which I
think is acceptable, and it's what New Hampshire does.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So more -- more time might be
-- might be a good idea, but that wouldn't satisfy your --
your complaint here.
MR. LINGER: If you go -- if you go --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your complaint is no
matter how much time you're given --
MR. LINGER: The -- the legislature -- if -- if
the law is overturned and the Tenth Circuit is affirmed,
the legislature might go back in then and address the
problem and they might come up with some solution as they
did back in 1980 when it became apparent to them that they
had set up a system where Libertarian candidates couldn't
be candidates for State office because they couldn't be
affiliated with a party with 6 -- for 6 months. They made
the change that is set forth in the statute that allows 15
days after the party is recognized.
It might very well be that a possibility the
legislature could pursue that could solve this problem, a
problem created by the State of Oklahoma, would be to
allow a period of time after a party is recognized for
voters, not just candidates, but for people who just want
to vote in the primary to change. That might be one
solution.
Or it might be, as in the State of New
Hampshire, where they allow that if it's a newly
recognized party and we recognize that all these people in
the State never had the opportunity to register in this
party, then they will have an open primary there.
So I don't think there's one solution for this
problem, and I think when the law, hopefully, is held to
be unconstitutional as it applies to Libertarians, then
the Oklahoma legislature can come in and perhaps remedy
the situation then.
Now, this -- this case is one in which there are
some other factors that have to be considered, and that is
the importance that is put on First Amendment rights to
political association. The State of Oklahoma, contrary to
the brief of the petitioners, has not been overburdened
with minor political parties. It is a State in which only
in presidential elections, by petitioning, have parties
even been able to gain ballot status.
The State has also a very severe -- the trial
judge in this case found that the retention requirement of
percent for every general election for the top of the
ticket was very difficult. The finding was that the
registration here was among -- very limited and among the
most difficult.
And finally, the State has imposed, I think
unwisely, primaries on these small political parties.
But other than the Libertarians and the Reform
Party, there have been no other minor parties on the
Oklahoma ballot. In this situation, we have to say to
ourselves, as the trial judge in fact commented on, is
whether or not the law is simply the result of the
concerns of the major parties. I do not think that the
State legislature in Oklahoma went out of its way to try
to interfere with the rights of Libertarians. I just
think that they never really considered them, and that is
why this Court has said on a number of occasions that when
the rights of independent voters and small parties are
impacted by legislation, that this Court should exercise
more strict and careful scrutiny there because --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how does that square with
Timmons where this Court turned away a party that says,
we've got this candidate and she's running on a major
party ticket and she's happy to be on ours too? And the
Court there said the State can legitimately eliminate --
limit the candidate to one party affiliation. So if it
can limit the candidate to one party affiliation, why not
the voter?
MR. LINGER: Because that was a candidacy right,
what the candidate was going to do, and in that particular
case, this Court noted that the candidate of the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party had a choice. That
candidate could have chosen to be the candidate of the
new party or that he could stay, as he did, with the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.
We don't have the choice here. They wanted to
have him be the candidate of both parties at the same
time. We recognize that the State may properly limit each
voter to a single nominating act, to a single vote, and
we're not asking that. We're not asking that the State
not be allowed to set reasonable times to let them know
about what we're going to do.
But in Timmons -- and I think Timmons is what
led the district court astray here was what was not
recognized was that there was a choice allowed in Timmons,
and there's not a choice here. If -- if this had been in
Oklahoma, in -- in that regard, there would have been no
way for -- there's no way for a voter who's in the
Republican or Democratic Parties who wants to vote in the
Libertarian Party because of the unreasonable deadlines to
change and because of the lack of opportunity, there's no
way that they can register. So they don't have the choice
to register as a Libertarian, as the candidate of the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party did in Timmons, to change if
he wanted to. He chose to stay in the major party. But
that is one significant difference with Timmons.
And also, of course, I couldn't -- I would also
want to mention that Minnesota is a State that has no
political party registration. So once again, the problem
and issues we're confronted with here could not occur in
Minnesota. But I think that's significant.
And there was -- there was nothing on any voter
that would have kept them from being able to vote for that
particular candidate in the general election. They were
going to be -- he was going to be on the ballot in the
general election. In this case, the voters that don't
have the choice that that candidate did in Timmons, they
are not going to be able to express their opinion on a
party that they would like to express an opinion in -- in
their primary. And I think that is a very important
distinction.
I think that oftentimes in the standard that the
court uses, that there is a difference, sometimes
depending on which particular judge writes the decision on
how a standard is explained. But in this case, it is, as
the Tenth Circuit said and as the district court
recognized, something that lies between this Court's
decision in Tashjian and this Court's decision in
California Democratic Party v. Jones. But in both those
cases, the Court recognized and called for exacting
scrutiny when a law was impacting a party's choice as to
how it wishes to choose its nominees. I do not think that
the rationale come up by the State, this thing about
draining, taking -- keeping the disloyal voters in the
Republican and Democratic Party and not letting them come
over, whether they wouldn't have voted at all, or whether
they didn't have the chance to register as Libertarians,
or whether they simply are inspired by the particular
candidates, I don't think in that situation that that is
either a compelling interest by the State and I certainly
don't think it is rational. And in fact, as far as being
paternalistic, I think the State is totally wrong there
because I think this would actually benefit the major
parties.
But I am saying to you that this is limited,
under the Tenth Circuit's decision, to the facts in
Oklahoma. And in other States, what the States can say
there, if it comes up, is what is a difference between us
and Oklahoma on ballot access and ballot retention, on
voter registration laws, on requirements. Do we allow,
like a number of the amici States, to have our minor
parties select by political party convention? But all of
this --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What are the mici States? You
said this a couple -- what are mici States? Mici States
did you say?
MR. LINGER: The amici, amicus --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, the --
MR. LINGER: -- amici.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I thought you were
saying mici.
MR. LINGER: Amici. Okay.
In any event, we ask that the Court, when it
fully considers this, under the particular facts and
circumstances in this case and the record, that the Court
will affirm the decision of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Linger.
Mr. Poe, you have about 3 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WELLON B. POE, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. POE: I will try and be brief, Your Honor.
The important thing to remember, in regards to
most of respondents' argument today and in their brief, is
that the events and the hurdles they are challenging now
were -- have never been raised at any time prior to this
briefing and this hearing. The district court did not
make findings as to the difficulty of the ballot access or
the ballot qualifications. He merely set forth what those
were. The Tenth Circuit never even addressed anything in
regards to ballot access or ballot qualifications and in
relation to the need to open up a primary. And in the
complaint, at the joint appendix page 22, the specific
relief sought by the respondents is to have section 1-
4, which is the semi-closed primary section -- have it
declared unconstitutional. There's no mention of any
other relief sought. No other section, the election
primary scheme, or anything else mentioned in their
complaint. It's never been raised before and it's never
been addressed by any court and -- and should not be
addressed by this Court at this point in time. There are
no findings for this Court to rely on to review the
allegations that have been made today.
Where the district court -- or where the Tenth
Circuit did error specifically is they found, as a matter of
fact or as a matter of law, based on Jones and Tashjian,
that any infringement upon a party's ability to associate
is a compelling -- must -- is subject to strict scrutiny
and requires a compelling State interest. Jones
specifically says that is not the case. Tashjian implies
that that is not the case. And the cases since Tashjian's
time say a compelling State interest is not always the
appropriate test. You look to the injury and then you
look to the burdens.
In this case, the appropriate burden -- or the
appropriate injury is not severe. They are reasonable
restrictions placed on Oklahoma to maintain the integrity
of its political system and its election system. With
that, the restrictions on -- in the Oklahoma statutes are
reasonable restrictions that govern and control and
support important State interests.
For that reason, the Tenth Circuit was
incorrect. The district court was correct in its
analysis, and we would ask that this Court reverse that
decision and find that those statutes are constitutional.
Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Poe.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the case in the
