General Kline.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This Court has never held that a specific
structure for weighing aggravating and mitigating
factors is required by the eighth amendment. Yet, this
Court has consistently held that all that is required
by the eighth amendment is for States to afford an
opportunity to jurors to consider all mitigating
evidence relevant to determination of a sentence other
than death.
The Kansas statute, it is undisputed in this
case, allowed the respondent to introduce all such
evidence and that the jurors, under Kansas law, are
specifically instructed to consider all such mitigating
evidence on an individualized basis.
JUSTICE SOUTER: General, may -- may I -- I'd
like to pose a question which at least gets to the nub
of the issue, as I see it, and -- and get your response
to it.
The premise of my question is this. We -- we
generally regard mitigation evidence as favoring life,
aggravation evidence as favoring death. We've got a
case in which the -- the assumption is that they are
evenly balanced. The -- the pans of the scale are
exactly even on that. Kansas says in that case the
jury shall return the verdict of death.
If we are going to demand, as we have said
that we're going to demand, that the determination --
that the death penalty determination be one of
what we have called reasoned moral judgment, then what
has to be supplied in order to make the Kansas
provision consistent with reasoned moral justice, it
seems to me, is a presumption in favor of death. Other
things being equal, there is a presumption in favor of
death.
And my question is, am I correct in saying
that in order to hold your way, we have to hold that
the eighth amendment -- is consistent with the
eighth amendment to presume the appropriateness of
death, other things being equal?
MR. KLINE: As the Court -- yes. As the
Court has done in Walton, the standard in the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you agree that's --
that's a proper way to look at the issue then.
MR. KLINE: Well, to take the issue in its
total context and refer to the instructions and the
totality of what the jury is instructed, I would
disagree that there is a presumption of death --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then how do you get off the
dime?
MR. KLINE: The jury is given in the
instruction, instruction number 4 and instruction
number 5, a direction as to the effect of their
reasoned moral judgment.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the -- the
direction, as I understand it, is that if mitigation
and aggravation are even, then the only way to come to
a conclusion is to say, as the statute does, because
the mitigation does not outweigh the aggravation, you
should return a verdict of death. And that seems to me
another way of saying there is a presumption that if
aggravation and mitigation are equal, that the penalty
should be death.
MR. KLINE: Instruction number 5 does
instruct the juror, Justice Souter, that if the State
meets the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt
that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the
aggravating factors, then the jury shall sentence the
defendant to death.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The State has made a
judgment that this particular offense -- what's it
called? Aggravated murder, you know, whatever --
MR. KLINE: First, they have to be convicted,
Justice Scalia, of capital murder.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Capital murder, as its name
implies, warrants a judgment of death unless there are
mitigating factors that -- which indicate that that is
not proper.
MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a moral judgment,
isn't it?
MR. KLINE: That certainly is, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And even if the State had
said the opposite, it -- it is a -- still a State-
prescribed moral judgment. If the State had said
capital murder warrants a judgment of death only if the
mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors,
that's still a State-prescribed moral judgment, isn't
MR. KLINE: That is correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: And can -- can you go back
to Justice Souter's question for a minute? Because the
way I'm thinking about this, I'm making two assumptions
that I'd like you to make: first, that there could be
such a case, which I very much doubt, but -- but this
is a lawyer's hypothetical, this whole thing, in a
sense. But I'll make the assumption there could be
such a case. Second, I will assume that our case law
leaves this open, a matter that can be argued.
But suppose that we do make that assumption
for the moment. Then what I'm thinking of is this
made-up case is the case of the following. We have
aggravating factors and break them down into molecules
on a scale, and for every molecule of aggravation here,
there is a molecule of mitigation there, so that the
juror who is very conscientious ends up with the same
number of molecules of equal weight on this scale. And
in our made-up instance, Kansas says, if that's the
situation, you must say death.
Now, if that's the case, how would you
reconcile that with a view of the eighth amendment that
says if you're going to sentence someone to death,
there has to be something special about his case that
means it's somewhat worse than the ordinary case
because, after all, for every molecule of specialness
that warranted death, we have a molecule of mitigation
that doesn't?
So that's where I am, trying to get the cases
out of it and trying to take very seriously the
hypothetical that is before us.
MR. KLINE: There -- thank you, Justice
Breyer. There are several considerations and steps
that must be approached and proven by the State before
we get to that actual equation.
First of all, the State follows the guided
discretion standard of this Court, as laid out in
Furman and its progeny, to a very narrow definition of
what capital murder is. In fact, the Kansas death
penalty statute is one of the most narrow in the
Nation.
And then past that point to the sentencing
jury, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at
least one of eight specific aggravating factors exist
with jury unanimity.
And then past that point, Kansas has complied
with this Court's requirement under the eighth
amendment for a juror to consider and give effect to
all mitigating evidence relevant to a sentence other
than death and that instruction is specifically pointed
out in your appendix, pages 23 through 28.
Furthermore, the jurors are --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The Furman -- the --
it's hard to tell where the voice is coming from, I
know. We ought to get that fixed.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: The Furman narrowing is
produced by the very first part of subsection (e). If,
by a unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable
doubt that one or more of the aggravating circumstances
enumerated in -- in section 24-4625 and amendments
thereto exist -- that's the Furman.
MR. KLINE: That is correct, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And then beyond that you say
if that is found, then the jury has to find that the
existence of such aggravating does not outweigh.
MR. KLINE: That is correct. And that --
that is how it complies with your hypothetical, Justice
Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you see, my
hypothetical is designed to cut free of the language of
the cases. I have no doubt you can go through the
language and show that. And it's designed to say, but
the very point of those cases is you do not send
someone to death unless the jury decides that the
circumstances here make him somewhat worse, at least
one molecule worth of worse, than the typical person.
And given the evenness of the balance, I don't see how
we can say that, though I grant you, when you go back
to those words in the cases, you're right.
MR. KLINE: Well, the guided discretion of
this Court has indicated that the State must be able to
-- and a juror -- differentiate between a defendant who
is convicted of the same crime as to the -- and
sentenced to life as the defendant who is sentenced to
the same crime and sentenced to death. And that is
laid out, as Justice Scalia pointed out, in the
definition of capital murder and the requirement of
aggravated factors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the -- the
instructions don't tell the jury to weigh the
molecules. They tell the jury that the State has to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating
molecules do not outweigh the aggravating molecules.
MR. KLINE: That is correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how likely is it,
if you have a jury who thinks the -- a juror, who
thinks the molecules are precisely balanced, is going
to conclude that the State has carried its burden of
proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the 50 here
don't outweigh the 50 here?
MR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a theoretical
proposition --
MR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice, we are dealing
with a hypothetical that we believe does not exist in
jury deliberations. A juror steps back and decides
whether they can live with the decision that is before
them and then decides whether the death penalty is
warranted.
And in fact, Kansas law leads them to that
reasoned moral decision. In Kansas law, in instruction
number 4, which again is laid out in your appendix,
instructs the juror that mercy, in and of itself, is
sufficient to determine a sentence other than death.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask -- ask you
this. As a -- rather than presumptions, can we look at
this case as a matter of shifting burdens of proof? I
-- I take it the Constitution does not require the
State to introduce mitigating evidence. That's --
that's the responsibility of the accused.
MR. KLINE: That is correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so what we're saying
here is that when a State shows that the mitigators do
not outweigh the aggravators, then it's the
defendant's/accused's burden to go forward and show
that they do.
MR. KLINE: Except -- you're correct, Justice
Kennedy, except that the burden on the State is beyond
a reasonable doubt to demonstrate that, the highest
burden allowed by law. And beyond that burden that was
in the Arizona statute, which was functionally
identical to the Kansas law, that was presented in this
-- to this Court in Walton v. Arizona, and this Court
rejected that very argument in that case. As you may
recall, the Arizona law was that there was a
responsibility for the defendant to demonstrate that
mitigating factors were sufficiently substantial to
call for leniency. The Arizona Supreme Court had
decided that that meant that the mitigating factors
must outweigh the aggravating factors.
And this Court accepted that case because of
a conflict between the ninth circuit which held, as the
Kansas Supreme Court did, in Adamson v. Ricketts, that
that was an unconstitutional violation of the eighth
amendment.
This Court resolved that conflict, and in
fact, States relied on that resolution, as did the
Kansas legislature, in articulating the very standard
except Kansas goes further and keeps the burden on the
State.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. In Arizona, the
burden was placed on the defendant, was it not --
MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice
O'Connor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- to -- to prove the
mitigation? And yet, the Court upheld that even in the
equipoise situation.
MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice
O'Connor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Over a dissent.
MR. KLINE: Correct. Justice Blackmun's
dissent.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So Kansas does not put the
burden on the defendant.
MR. KLINE: Not at any stage of the
proceeding. The burden remains on the State to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but I take it
the State has no duty to adduce mitigating factors.
MR. KLINE: It is incumbent upon the
defendant, Justice Kennedy, to bring forth factors in
mitigation. The standard, though, in introduction is
relevancy, and Kansas has met the -- the requirements
of this Court, as it relates to the specific sentencing
or individualized sentencing structure, by allowing the
jury to consider all evidence relevant to the
determination of a sentence other than death.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that means they
comply with Lockett.
I want to ask you one question that goes back
to your colloquy with Justice Souter and Justice
Scalia. Justice Scalia pointed out that the State has
made a moral judgment on a certain state of facts, the
death penalty shall be imposed and which you agreed
with. And that was true in the cases back in 1975 and
. There were some State statutes that mandated death
based on the moral judgment of the State in certain
circumstances. I think one was a North Carolina
statute.
Do you ask us to reexamine those cases?
MR. KLINE: No, Justice Stevens. Actually
the State's position is consistent with the previous
decisions of this Court in this fashion.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It -- it does not rely on
the proposition that there's a situation in which
there's a mandated death penalty which is perfectly
okay.
MR. KLINE: No, because there is a
requirement upon the State in the sentencing phase to
prove factors in aggravation with jury unanimity beyond
a reasonable doubt that set aside this particular act
in a different framework than those who commit capital
murder and are convicted of capital murder. If the
State does not meet that burden --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but of course, the
aggravators -- it would be permissible for a State to
include the aggravators necessary to narrow the category
in the definition of the crime itself.
MR. KLINE: This Court has held that it does.
And Kansas has a very narrow death penalty in the
definition of capital murder and also the specified
aggravators that the State must prove.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But you would say that if
the State met that burden and there was no mitigating
or no substantial mitigating evidence, it would be
permissible to -- for the State to mandate the death
penalty.
MR. KLINE: Just as it is in Walton v.
Arizona.
JUSTICE STEVENS: The answer is yes.
MR. KLINE: Yes. The answer is yes, Justice
Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And you think that's fully
consistent with the North Carolina case.
MR. KLINE: It is not fully consistent, I
don't believe. It is consistent with the Walton case
in that this Court said a mandatory death penalty is
not unconstitutional, as long as the State
differentiates between those convicted of the same
crime and who are sentenced to life and those who are
convicted of the same crime and sentenced to death.
Kansas clearly does that in the requirement that the
State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one of at
least eight specific statutory aggravating factors
exist in the case.
But Kansas goes further. Unlike in Walton v.
Arizona, the burden remains on the State to also prove
that the mitigating evidence proffered by the defendant
who has the lowest threshold allowed by law, and all
that is required by this Court -- that is relevancy --
that all of that evidence does not outweigh --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it -- that's the way
Justice Blackmun interpreted the majority, but the
majority didn't quite say that because it said the
burden on the defendant was to prove sufficient
mitigation to justify something other than the death
penalty. And conceivably one could have met that
burden with substantial mitigating evidence that came
out even.
MR. KLINE: Well, the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Under the majority's
opinion -- now, you're dead right about what Justice
Blackmun said, but --
MR. KLINE: Justice Stevens, you are correct.
The majority didn't specifically address that, but
they also analyzed the case, much as Justice Kennedy
just did, in saying that really what we're talking
about is whether the State eventually at some point,
once it has met the requirement of the individualized
sentencing requirements of this Court, can say that
death is appropriate. And the answer in this Court's
jurisprudence has been clearly yes once we are able to
set aside this defendant from other defendants
convicted of the same crime.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But you would agree that it
would be consistent with the -- the text of the
majority opinion to say it really meant they have to
prove enough mitigating evidence to make death the
inappropriate sentence, which could be less than --
even a 50/50 balance?
MR. KLINE: Arguably, yes, Justice Stevens.
And that is the language of the Arizona statute, but it
would fly in the face of the interpretation of the
Arizona Supreme Court, as well as the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals in Adamson v. Ricketts which,
subsequent to the Walton decision, held that Walton
controlled and allowed the potentiality of equipoise to
be constitutional.
Now, one thing I would like to --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you going to address
the other questions? I think we added a question
about whether the Kansas Supreme Court's judgment was
adequately supported by an independent State ground.
And I'm not sure that this has been adequately
addressed.
Do we have jurisdiction here? The -- the
Kansas Supreme Court vacated the capital murder
judgment and remanded it and said it would have done it
anyway because of the State law evidentiary error
concerning admission of third party guilt evidence. So
does that independent ground mean we don't have
jurisdiction here on this thing?
MR. KLINE: No, Justice O'Connor, there is
not an independent and adequate State ground for this
decision. It is undisputed that the Kansas Supreme
Court relies on this Court's interpretation of the
eighth amendment for the interpretation of the cruel or
unusual punishment clause of the Kansas constitution.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there was another
ground.
MR. KLINE: Yes, but it is not adequate and
independent. The argument of the respondent is that
the constitutional savings doctrine and severability
arguments are independent and adequate, and by their
very nature, they are dependent rather than
independent.
The Kansas Supreme Court engaged in a -- and
I quote from the decision -- a full reexamination of
the eighth amendment jurisprudence in coming to the
conclusion in paragraph 25 of the syllabus, which is
the law of the case in Kansas under Kansas law, that
the Kansas death penalty statute is unconstitutional on
its face. That was the first such holding in Kansas
jurisprudence history finding that determination.
Previously, 3 years earlier, the court had
found the death penalty statute constitutional as
construed, and as this Court knows, you will not accept
jurisdiction of a State court's interpretation or
construction of a State law. So, therefore, this is
the first opportunity that the State has had and I
would say the last.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but was this -- was
this case remanded for a new trial?
MR. KLINE: It is, Your Honor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And presumably, if there
is a conviction and a sentence, you could come back
here again by way of a cross appeal.
MR. KLINE: That would be incorrect, Justice
O'Connor. Kansas is prohibited. The prosecutors are
prohibited and limited of the right of appeal in Kansas
law as in most States.
And -- and this Court had a similar case in
Neville v. South Dakota in which you construed South
Dakota law as it relates to limiting the prosecution's
ability to appeal and, through that construction,
identified in an interlocutory basis, when the lower
court passes on a constitutional measure that has
import for this Court, that the inability of the State
to be able to pursue that case renders jurisdiction
under 28, section 1257. So --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If I -- if I understand
what the situation is, there is no death penalty in
Kansas as a result of this decision.
MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice
Ginsburg. There is no death penalty. The highest
court of our State has spoken and stricken it down as
unconstitutional on its face.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Has there been any
movement in the legislature to change the law so you
won't be in this situation where there is no death
penalty?
MR. KLINE: Justice Ginsburg, there's
significant discussion in the legislature, but that
discussion is somewhat mixed, as you might imagine, and
some were concerned that action might moot this case.
Right now there are 12 pending capital murder cases in
Kansas which, if this Court does not reverse the Kansas
Supreme Court, the State will not be able to seek
capital murder charges and the death sentence in those
cases.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that wouldn't be true
if you amended the statute though, would it? If you -- if
they amended the statute to take the 50/50 problem out
of it, which wouldn't seem to me all that difficult,
you could still impose the death penalty on these other
people who haven't been tried.
MR. KLINE: It is our position, Justice
Stevens, since their crimes were committed prior to any
act of the legislature, we would be prohibited from
seeking the death penalty.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Because of an ameliorating
amendment to the death penalty statute?
MR. KLINE: That is -- that is our -- our
position. It would have to take an entire --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I doubt if you'd take that
position if they did it.
(Laughter.)
MR. KLINE: Well, Justice Stevens, if you put
me in that position, I will be an advocate for the
State.
However, it is our position, as Justice
Ginsburg alluded to, that the State has no death
penalty and it would take a complete reenactment of the
death penalty for the State to have one.
And that is borne out in case law. There is
no uncertainty as it relates to the ability of the
State to seek appeal in charging death once there is no
death statute that is available. The references in
Kansas law to KSA section 22-3602(b) are a very settled
area of the law. The respondent argues that subsection
(1) of that statute would allow us an opportunity to
preserve this issue below. However, that only relates
to the State being able to appeal charging documents,
and the definitions of those documents are very
specific in Kansas law.
Furthermore, subsection (3) states that a
prosecutor can reserve an issue, but case law is very
clear, and that is only if the Kansas Supreme Court
sees that issue as important for the administration of
justice, the uniform administration of justice, in the
State, and has interpreted that to mean only where
guidance of the supreme court is necessary. It is not
a method for moving for rehearing. The Kansas Supreme
Court rejects that. We moved for reconsideration and
reconsideration was not granted.
If this Court embarks, as the respondent asks
it to, it will put in jeopardy 12 capital murder cases
and prevent 12 capital murder cases from being pursued
in Kansas. It will effectively strike down the laws of
seven other States that have functionally identical
statutes as Kansas.
And furthermore, it would effectively call
into question the laws of five other States that do not
even require any weighing mechanism whatsoever. This
Court has never gone further and required a specific
mechanism of weighing aggravating and mitigating
circumstances and has relegated that duty, as it
should, to the States as long as the juror has the
opportunity to make the reasoned moral decision based
on the consideration of all mitigating evidence
relevant to a decision other than death that relates to
the character, the background of the defendant, or the
circumstances of the offense.
And if you would look in your joint appendix
on pages 25 and 26, you will see the instructions that
the State of Kansas gave in this case, and it is
undisputed that the respondent's presentation of
mitigating evidence was presented to the jury in full,
and additionally, the jury was specifically instructed
to consider and give weight -- I'm sorry. It's pages
and 25 -- specifically instructed to give weight to
all of that evidence. Pages 24 and 25. I am referring
to instruction number 4. And you will see the
delineation beginning on page 25 of all the mitigating
evidence that was admitted as relevant in this case.
And I would also say that Kansas continues to
bear a greater burden in its consideration -- for the
juror's consideration in that the juror is instructed
on paragraph 2 of instruction 4 that mercy in and of
itself is sufficient -- is sufficient -- to outweigh
the aggravating evidence presented by the State. So
contrary to the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I have no idea what that
means. I mean, you -- you go into this very elaborate
system, you know, molecules on one side, molecules on
the other.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: And then you throw the whole
thing up in the air and say mercy alone is enough. I
mean --
MR. KLINE: Justice Scalia, I think it is --
it is default for a life sentence. And I believe it
is certainly an acknowledgement that what really
happens here is a juror steps back, after the
consideration of all the evidence that this Court
requires under the eighth amendment, and decides what
they can live with: a sentence of death or a sentence
of life. And one juror who has doubt can extend mercy.
And, Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the
Court, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.
Ms. Woodman, we'll hear now from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA E. WOODMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. WOODMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I'd like to devote the bulk of my time to
answering the State's arguments on the merits because
the constitutional issue presented by the Kansas
capital sentencing statute is actually quite different
than the State and its amici would have it appear.
Their arguments rest on an erroneous assumption about
the way the statute operates and the real issues that
its operation raises.
Under the Kansas formula, prosecutors can and
do urge jurors not to persevere in their decision-
making if they are undecided regarding the balance of
aggravating and mitigating circumstances. In other
words, if the decision is too hard to make, the
sentence must be death. The formula --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is it reasonable
to suppose that one of those cases where it's too hard
to decide is when there are 50 molecules on one side
and 50 on the other? In other words, it would seem to
me that that's an easy case to say that the State has
not met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt
that the mitigating factors don't outweigh the
aggravating ones when the evidence is evenly balanced.
MS. WOODMAN: No, Your Honor. I think that
it's not right to think of this in terms of
mathematical formulas, molecules on one side or the
other. This is a subjective, qualitative determination
that the jury makes, and whatever capital sentencing
statute a State chooses, States are free to choose
whatever structure they see fit to determine whether
death is an appropriate sentence. However, States are
not free to enact a statute that doesn't ensure a
reliable determination that death is an appropriate
sentence, and that's what we're dealing with here.
It's a qualitative judgment and one can imagine, very
easily I think, a scenario where jurors are
deliberating. They take their jobs very seriously and
they cannot make a determination whether aggravators
outweigh mitigators, or vice versa.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's because the
defendant hasn't introduced enough evidence of
mitigation and that's the duty of the defendant to come
forward with it.
MS. WOODMAN: Well, in -- in a situation of
equipoise, by which I mean a state of indecision on
whether the relative balance between aggravating and
mitigating circumstances, burden of proof is not the
sticking point there.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say it's a state
of indecision. The jury has decided that aggravating
factors have been established.
MS. WOODMAN: But that -- that's -- that's
the problem because that's not a reliable
determination. It's no determination that based upon
the individual --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't it a reliable
determination that, number one, it's a death-qualified
accused in -- in any event, and there have been
specific aggravators proved? That has been determined.
It's now for the defendant, in effect, to show that
the mitigating circumstances outweigh this. The -- and
you have the bonus that the State has to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the mitigators have not
--
outweighed the aggravators.
MS. WOODMAN: But the jury is specifically
instructed under this formula that they have a third
option, and that is where they can't make a decision,
whether aggravators outweigh mitigators, or vice versa
JUSTICE KENNEDY: They have made the
decision. They have made the decision that the
aggravators are there and have not been outweighed.
They have made that decision.
MS. WOODMAN: But the jury is required to
impose death at that point, and it is a decision that
aggravators are not outweighed by mitigators. But this
Court's eighth amendment jurisprudence requires --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's because the
mitigation case hasn't been made.
MS. WOODMAN: The eighth amendment requires
jurors to make a determination, based upon individual
characteristics, whether death is an appropriate
sentence, whether the defendant deserves death. And
when the jury is in a situation of equipoise and is
required to impose death, they're imposing death
without having made that determination that death is an
appropriate --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. They're -- they're
--
saying it is appropriate. They're saying it is
appropriate. We have the people put in the box. The
box is are they in a situation that is different from
the average murderer. Yes. And they're making the
determination that although they're in that box, that
morally they're no different. Morally they're the same
MS. WOODMAN: Well, there's no --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- because for every factor
that makes them morally one way, there's a factor that
makes them morally the other way. So they're
different, but they're not morally different.
Now, that's -- that's what I think this case
presents. And I -- I mean, I imagine a juror who's
thinking just what I said. I don't know if there ever
was such a juror, but if there was such a juror, the
statute in this instant tells him what to do.
MS. WOODMAN: The statute does tell them what
to do. It tells --
JUSTICE BREYER: It says where you think
there is an equivalent, but not a moral difference,
death.
MS. WOODMAN: Well, but if -- if you think --
if you look at the prosecutorial arguments, for
example, that have been made in both the Kleypas and
Marsh cases, those prosecutorial arguments have urged
the jurors to do exactly what I described, and that is
to abdicate their decision to make a -- a determination
based on the -- on individual characteristics on
the question of whether death is an appropriate
punishment for this individual offender based on the
specific circumstances of this crime, and that if
they're in equipoise, they have to impose a death
sentence. That is encouraging the jurors to abdicate
their decision to determine whether death is an
appropriate sentence or not.
Then --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. Woodman, you
know, I -- I have not, you know, gone along with --
with most of our Walton jurisprudence anyway, but --
but what I have really always thought it demanded was
really nothing more precise than that a jury has to be
given the opportunity to grant mercy. I -- I'm not
sure I would describe any of it as any more precise
than that.
MS. WOODMAN: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The jury has to be given the
opportunity to say this poor devil doesn't deserve the
death penalty. However you want to put that, you know,
you can put the burdens here, the burdens there. You
can talk about equipoise or not. Does the jury have a
chance to say this -- this fellow does not deserve the
death penalty? That --
MS. WOODMAN: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and clearly exists
under this scheme, it seems to me. Any jury that --
that really thinks this person should not go to death
can -- can do it. In fact, you know, I guess the
statute does not demand that instruction, but that
instruction that says -- what is it? The
appropriateness of the exercise of mercy can itself be
a mitigating factor. I mean, gee, what -- what else --
what else do you have to do?
MS. WOODMAN: But that's one factor among
many that the jury has to consider. And the problem
here is that the jury could have all of the information
that a defendant has proffered as a basis for a
sentence less than death, and a jury could still be
unable to decide whether aggravation or mitigation is
the weightier in a closely balanced case. And that is
the problem here.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Any jury that thought this
-- this person did not deserve death would have ample
opportunity to give expression to that determination
under this scheme.
--
MS. WOODMAN: Only if they persevere in that
decision-making, and prosecutors urge them not to by
telling them that they must impose death when they
cannot decide the balance between aggravating and
mitigating circumstances.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Woodman, you said that
they didn't make such an argument in this case and in
some other case, but you did not include the argument
in the joint appendix, did you?
MS. WOODMAN: No, I did -- we did not include
the prosecutorial closing arguments. They are in --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- are you -- the
-- the argument --
MS. WOODMAN: They are in the brief.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is a brief from the
Kansas law professors, and this is the instruction from
the Kleypas case?
MS. WOODMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the aggravators are not
outweighed by the mitigators, you shall impose the
death penalty, not that you may, not that you can, but
that you shall impose the death penalty. This is the
duty you were sworn to uphold. Shows command. It
means must. That's -- is that the type of instruction
MS. WOODMAN: That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the type of argument?
MS. WOODMAN: That's correct, and then in Mr.
Marsh's case, which is part of the record in this case
-- and I've cited to the record for that argument,
which is at -- I apologize. It's at volume 54 at pages
and 55 of the record of the Kansas Supreme Court in
the Marsh case. And in that case, the prosecutorial
arguments told the jury that they can't even consider
mitigating evidence unless they find that mitigating
circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances
because the law has told you and the judge has told you
that the law says that if the aggravating circumstances
are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, you
shall return a verdict of death.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And therefore, they
shouldn't consider mitigating at all, he told them?
MS. WOODMAN: No. This is not a question of
not being able to consider mitigating circumstances.
And as I said --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is this mercy
instruction always given? Is that standard? Is it --
is it, in effect, that -- that mercy is -- is always
one of the mitigating circumstances?
MS. WOODMAN: Yes. That's part of the jury
instructions in capital cases.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I -- I really don't see
what -- what complaint you have then. Any jury that --
that thinks this person deserves mercy says, I think he
deserves mercy, and that's -- that's a -- a mitigating
circumstance that outweighs whatever aggravating
circumstances there are.
MS. WOODMAN: But when you think about the
difficulty of the individualized sentencing decision
that the jury has to make, the -- one juror might feel
that way, but it's only if they persevere in that
decisionmaking. This statutory equipoise provision
encourages jurors not to persevere in their
decisionmaking. They're -- they're sitting around in
the jury room. One juror --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is the
statutory equipoise provision?
MS. WOODMAN: It says that if the jury finds
the existence of at least one aggravating factor and
determines further that any aggravating circumstances
that exist are not outweighed by any mitigating
circumstances found to exist, the sentence shall be
death.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's my
question. There is no --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If the State is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is no statutory
equipoise provision. The State has a burden of proof
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating
factors don't outweigh the aggravating. That's what
you mean by the statutory equipoise provision?
MS. WOODMAN: The statutory equipoise
provision, as the Kansas Supreme Court found -- they
construed this statute. They construed it to mean that
it requires death when jurors are undecided about the
balance between aggravating and mitigating
circumstances. That construction of the statute is
entitled to respect. And under --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Who said that? Excuse me.
That -- that description of the statute.
MS. WOODMAN: The Kansas Supreme Court in the
Kleypas case in holding it unconstitutional.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it seems to me the
statute doesn't really say that, does it? But I mean,
what the statute says is that if it's in perfect
equipoise, the State loses because the State has the
burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the --
that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators.
It seems to me if a jury sees them in perfect
equipoise, the jury would have to say the State has not
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators do
not outweigh the aggravators. What -- isn't that what a
jury would have to say?
MS. WOODMAN: No. Under the statute, the
State's burden of proof, which is beyond a reasonable
doubt -- I'll grant that, but it's to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the aggravators are not
outweighed by the mitigators.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. Okay. And --
and if the jury cannot decide whether the aggravators
are outweighed by the mitigators, if they're in perfect
equipoise, who loses?
MS. WOODMAN: The defendant.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No. The State loses. It's
the State that has the burden of proving beyond a
reasonable doubt that they are --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the Kansas Supreme
Court thought that --
MS. WOODMAN: The Kansas Supreme Court
construed it to mean that a tie goes to the -- to the
State.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's different from saying
not decided. I thought the Kansas Supreme Court didn't
speak of not decided. I thought it didn't speak in
Kleypas about a jury who -- a juror who can't make up
its -- his mind. I thought it said the jury has made
-- it assumed the juror has made up his mind. That's
why I think it's artificial. It says where the jury
finds. It finds equipoise as to the mitigating and
aggravating circumstance, then death, that the jury has
to find that.
MS. WOODMAN: But this is not about
structuring decisionmaking. This is about terminating
decisionmaking on the issue that is central to the
eighth amendment requirements at the selection stage --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's terminating it
because there's not enough mitigating evidence.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's true I -- I think,
isn't it?
And then the question is, does a State have a
right not to do with burden of proof, not to do with
anything else, but to have perhaps the artificial
situation where the jury finds that the evidence is in
equipoise whoever has the burden of proof. Put it all
on you, whoever had it. That was their final
conclusion. I find it is in equipoise.
Next question: what happens?
MS. WOODMAN: Well, the statute hasn't
assigned a burden of proof, but still that's not the
problem here.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I agree with you.
That's not the problem.
MS. WOODMAN: Because what the
individualization requirement means, in this Court's
own jurisprudence, is that mere consideration of
mitigating circumstances is not enough. The Court said
so in Tennard and in many other cases, Penry v.
Johnson, that it's not enough that the sentencer be
allowed to consider mitigating circumstances. It must
be allowed to consider and give effect to those
mitigating circumstances.
And when a jury cannot decide between
aggravating and mitigating circumstances, when that
jury is, nevertheless, required under this -- that
situation to impose a sentence of death, the sentence
of death has been imposed without the jury having made
the requisite individualized sentencing decision under
the eighth amendment at the selection stage.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I might point out -- I just
looked at the question presented. It does assume --
and I guess is drafted by the Kansas Attorney General.
The question is what happens when mitigating and
aggravating evidence is in equipoise. So the
assumption on which we took the case is that there will
be cases in which there's equipoise.
MS. WOODMAN: That's right. And the Kansas
Supreme Court found that that was a real possibility.
And the Kansas Supreme Court found this statute
unconstitutional in Kleypas because it violates the
individualized sentencing requirement, and the court
specifically found that it requires death when jurors
are unable to decide the balance between aggravating
and mitigating circumstances. That's how the statute
was construed in Kleypas.
I would like to address the jurisdictional
issue for a few moments, unless there are any further
questions from the Court on the equipoise issue, which
I'd be happy to answer. But one of the things I want
to discuss today is the jurisdictional issue on the
adequate and independent State law ground, which this
Court asked the parties to brief.
I feel that the State misstates the issue
there as well because in the Kansas Supreme Court, the
State conceded the Federal unconstitutionality of the
Kansas equipoise formula, as decided by the court in
the Kleypas case 4 years ago, and defended in this case
only on the contested State law ground of severability
and bypassed raising a Federal question in a motion for
a rehearing, which again relied solely on State law
severability grounds.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the -- the Attorney
General said that the -- the fact that in this
particular case the issue was focused on, in effect,
sort of remedy, severance, and so on, was dependent
upon the assumption about what Federal law required.
It was dependent upon the earlier case which so held.
So I don't -- and -- and what he seem -- says seems
plausible to me. I -- I don't see how we can divorce
the judgment here with the earlier judgment, which
Kansas -- which the Kansas Supreme Court relied upon
here, which was a Federal ground.
MS. WOODMAN: Well, it's clear that the
Kansas Supreme Court's decision relies on severability
as a basis for its decision, and it's true that the
Kansas Supreme Court, in doing so, reiterated the
Kleypas holding.
JUSTICE SOUTER: It wouldn't have even raised
the issue had it not been for the earlier Federal
holding. Isn't that correct?
MS. WOODMAN: That's right, but Mr. Marsh
raised the issue on State law severability grounds.
The State conceded that Mr. Marsh was entitled to have
his death sentence vacated because of the
unconstitutional equipoise provision.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you -- I
-- I take it this is the implication of your position.
Do you take this position that in any instance in
which a State supreme court decides a case on a Federal
-- decides an issue on a Federal ground in case A, and
for whatever reason, case A is not brought to this
Court for review, that in every subsequent case in the
State system, which depends upon State A, the State is
totally without the -- or this Court is -- is totally
without jurisdiction to review it?
MS. WOODMAN: Where the issue has not been
pressed by a party in the State court, no, I don't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how could the issue be
pressed? I mean, it had already been decided by the
supreme court. I mean, what -- what could the State
say to the trial court?
MS. WOODMAN: Well, we asked the court to
overrule the severability decision in Kleypas. There
was absolutely nothing preventing the State from
arguing that the constitutional decision in Kleypas
should be overruled. Absolutely nothing preventing
that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think this -- you think
the State has to challenge as unconstitutional a
decision of the State supreme court in -- in the lower
court, lower State court.
MS. WOODMAN: I think that they --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you expect the lower
State court to come out on that?
MS. WOODMAN: Well, but futility is never a
reason for not raising an issue. Criminal defendants
are required to raise issues all the time in order to
preserve them for later review. In Engle v. Isaacs,
this -- this Court said futility is no excuse. And
what is good for criminal defendants, very
respectfully, is good for the State. And Justice
Rehnquist said as much for the Court in the Court's
decision in Illinois v. Gates, that -- that States are
not exempt from the ordinary rules of procedure which
govern this Court's jurisdiction.
And the fact of the matter is that the State
not only did not raise the Federal issue in the Kansas
Supreme Court below, which it could have, but it
conceded the Federal unconstitutionality of the
statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a little different
from an adequate and independent State ground argument.
You're -- you're now making a -- a waiver argument.
MS. WOODMAN: Well, there's a -- there's a
relationship between the adequate and independent State
law cases and the not pressed or passed upon cases
because, for example, in Michigan v. Long, this Court
has said where an issue is pressed -- a Federal issue
is pressed in the State courts, then this Court on
review will resolve any ambiguity in the Court's
opinion in favor of a presumption that the issue was
passed upon by the State court.
But conversely, in Coleman v. Thompson, this
Court held that where an issue is not pressed in the
State courts, then the presumption will be the
opposite. The presumption will be that the State court
has not passed upon --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we don't need a
presumption here. I mean, the -- the only basis for
inquiring into severability is the presumed
unconstitutionality of the statute. I mean, that's the
only basis why severability comes up. We don't have to
presume anything.
MS. WOODMAN: But the Kansas Supreme Court
didn't redecide that issue in the Marsh case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't matter whether it
redecided it. It -- it was the postulate of -- of its
-- necessary postulate of -- of its decision in this
case, it seems to me.
MS. WOODMAN: There -- well, under article
III and under section 1257(a), there has to be a case
or controversy for this Court to review. There was no
live case or controversy in the Kansas Supreme Court on
the Federal question of whether the equipoise provision
in the Kansas statute was constitutional. It was
conceded that it was unconstitutional and the parties
agreed on that. It was treated as settled. And all
the Kansas Supreme Court did, before overruling the
Kleypas severability decision, which is a matter of
State law, was to reiterate that holding, and mere
reiteration, as this Court knows from the Morrison v.
Watson case, approved in Illinois v. Gates, that is not
the decision of a Federal question.
JUSTICE SOUTER: If you're -- if you're
right, I take it, we would not have jurisdiction to
review a Federal ground that was raised by a State
court, even though it had not been raised by the
parties. If they get -- you know, they get the opinion
from the court and there's a big surprise -- the -- the
State court decided to go off on -- on a Federal
ground, which had not been pressed -- I take it on your
view we would not have jurisdiction to review that.
MS. WOODMAN: I don't believe the Court
would, and I think that's what the Court's original
jurisdictional rules were intended to be.
Now, I do understand that the Court has taken
jurisdiction over such issues, and it's usually --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because
the -- the formula is that the issue has to either have
been raised or decided.
MS. WOODMAN: Well, the only issue that I
could find that says that -- that really enforces that
rule is the Cohen v. Cowles Media case. And if you
look at the provenance of that decision, that's the
only case where the Court actually considered a
question for the first time in -- in this Court. And
what happened in that case is that the Federal issue
that was presented to this Court was actually discussed
at oral argument. It wasn't raised by either of the
parties in their briefs in the State court, but it was
discussed at oral argument. And the Court decided a
first amendment issue on the basis of that discussion
at oral argument. And so this Court took jurisdiction
and stated that as long as it's been passed upon, it's
not necessary that it was pressed upon.
And the decision, which the Court relied on
in that case is, if I'm remembering it correctly, was a
decision involving a Federal question which was raised
too late to comply with the procedural requirements in
State court. And so it's really not the case that this
Court routinely takes cases where the issue was not
pressed by the parties in the State courts. And that's
the situation we have in this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I don't -- I
don't -- excuse me. I don't understand how that makes
any sense. If you had an -- a -- a case that's
litigated entirely on State law grounds and in the
State supreme court opinion, they announce we are sua
sponte deciding this on the basis of the Federal
Constitution and you, State, lose, your argument is
that State is just out of luck. They can't seek
review of that decision?
MS. WOODMAN: I think where the issue is
decided sua sponte and affects the parties in that
case, then maybe.
But that didn't happen here. What happened
here was that the court merely reiterated a holding
from 4 years ago, and the State law severability
decision, which was the issue in contest in this case
and the issue that was decided in this case, the
matter of State law, and it was sufficient to support
the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court.
And really, what -- what the State is trying
to do here is to -- I mean, these issues were decided
in the Kleypas case, and if we were here on the Kleypas
case, there wouldn't be any argument as to whether the
Kansas Supreme Court's decision rested on an adequate
and independent State law ground because the Federal
issue was clearly decided and it was interwoven with
the State law determination. But that's not the case
here.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Kleypas didn't hold that the
whole statute was bad. Kleypas gave a savings
construction of the statute, as I recall.
MS. WOODMAN: Yes, they did. But the State
is misconstruing their decision by saying they didn't
decide the constitutional question in Kleypas. It was
merely construction of the statute to avoid the
constitutional issue and therefore --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but in the case
before us, the court -- the Kansas court said -- I
think it's 24 or 25 of the -- of the headnote -- we are
reconsidering the issue.
MS. WOODMAN: The -- that language in the
court's opinion was, after full reconsideration, we're
declining to revisit the issue at the dissenter's
invitation. We're declining that invitation to revisit
the issue.
And there's no question that the court
discussed it and thought about it, and the dissenters
were clearly inviting them --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And made a reasoned
judgment about it.
MS. WOODMAN: But they didn't reopen the
issue. They said there's nothing new here. We don't
need to reopen this decision, and --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they reopened it to
the extent as Justice Scalia has indicated, but they
now take a different view of the validity of the State
statute.
MS. WOODMAN: They're taking a --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's -- that's a decision
following a reason, and the reason is a Federal reason.
MS. WOODMAN: Well, no, because the -- what
they were saying was that the appropriate remedy in
Kleypas was to return the subject to the legislature
because the statute was ambiguous and the court had no
authority, under separation of powers grounds and under
State law statutory interpretation grounds, to construe
this statute to mean the opposite of what it said. And
that's the decision that they overruled in this case,
and that's a State law decision.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the State can get
mouse-trapped in this way. In -- in the first case, it
doesn't take the case up because not too much has been
lost, and then in the second case, the court says, oh,
by the way, everything has been lost. And you say that
we can't review that because -- because the -- the
State didn't -- didn't challenge Kleypas at the time.
MS. WOODMAN: Or challenge that decision in
this case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that decision in
this -- they had no reason to challenge it until the
State decided to -- to change it.
MS. WOODMAN: But if they wanted to raise the
issue, they could have raised it in either case, and we
wouldn't have this problem here. But they didn't raise
it, and that presents a jurisdictional problem for this
Court.
What they're trying to do in this case is
yoke a live horse to a dead one to form a plowing team,
and it doesn't work.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I like that.
(Laughter.)
MS. WOODMAN: I looked -- as a matter of
fact, I looked at our Kansas State seal because it has
a plowing -- a horse-drawn plow on it, and I looked at
it again this morning before I came in here because I
couldn't remember whether it was one horse or two, and
it's two horses. And I was thinking about how the
meaning of that State seal would be fundamentally
altered if one of those horses was dead.
(Laughter.)
MS. WOODMAN: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.
Woodman.
General Kline, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
The State is here on a final court decision
wrongfully -- the State supreme court wrongfully
interpreting this Court's eighth amendment
jurisprudence. And just as Justice Souter and the
Chief Justice's hypotheticals, as it relates to this
case, were articulated, it is actually true that in
this case the State was not aware that this issue would
be raised again and only conceded -- and waiver is
truly not an issue because a lower court did not rely
upon it. And we have some confusion between the terms
here. It only conceded that Kleypas, a decision by the
Kansas Supreme Court, was the law of the case in
another case subsequently reaching the Kansas Supreme
Court. And the Kansas Supreme Court, on its own
motion, engaged in a full reconsideration and the
respondent in their brief argues that the primary
reliance of the court was not on eighth amendment
jurisprudence but other grounds.
There is no requirement for jurisdiction
under 28-1257 that the primary reliance be on a Federal
issue. There is a requirement to deny jurisdiction
that there be an independent and adequate State ground
on which the decision would rest regardless of the
outcome of the Federal issue. Clearly that's not the
case here.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't they have come out
the same way if they never mentioned the Federal issue?
MR. KLINE: This case come out -- no, it
would not because the Kleypas court found that the
Kansas -- or the Kansas death penalty was
constitutional as construed. And the Kansas court in
this case found it unconstitutional on its face. And
there is a significant difference, and the court raised
the issue again.
I would like to point out to the Court that
there are five ways that a juror can, after their
reasoned moral decision, give effect to the belief that
the mitigating evidence does not warrant the death
penalty.
The juror can state that they have a
reasonable doubt as to whether the State has met its
burden of proving that the mitigating factors do not
outweigh the aggravating factors.
The juror can simply delay. Kansas law has a
defect -- default for life in its sentence or in its
structure, and I would encourage you to read on page 28
of your appendix instruction number 12 in which the jury
is told that if, after a reasonable time, you are unable
to make a decision -- in other words, in a doubtful
case -- the judge is required by law to dismiss the
jury and sentence the defendant to life. And so there
is a default for life, and that is another way that a
juror can give effect to their reasoned moral decision
that death is not appropriate.
The juror can give effect to their reasoned
moral decision that is not appropriate by determining
that the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating
factors. And the juror under instruction number 5 --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it cannot do that by
determining that they're in equipoise.
MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is the very issue
your -- your petition presents us with.
MR. KLINE: It is, but the juror does know
what the effect of that decision is and, therefore, is
able to engage in a reasoned moral choice.
What truly happens -- and -- and Justice
Breyer alluded to it, I believe, as it relates to this
hypothetical about weighing molecules -- is that a
juror essentially steps back and decides what is the
appropriate sentence --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, do it. Do it.
Make the reasoned moral choice. And the facts are that
we have, because of the balancing, molecules or not --
we have by the balancing made a determination that
anything for the bad that distinguishes this person
from the ordinary is -- is equally balanced by the
good. Now, make the moral choice.
MR. KLINE: I think the moral --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is the reason?
MR. KLINE: I think the moral decision,
Justice Breyer, is determined in all the variables of
the introduction of the evidence, and as this Court has
required under the eighth amendment, that it allow the
jury to consider and give effect to all mitigating
evidence relevant. And that's in Kansas law.
I would state this in closing, and that is
that the Kansas legislature reenacted the death penalty
for the first time since this Court struck it down in
Furman in the spring of 1994. And in doing so, it gave
great deference to this Court's role as final arbiter
of the meaning of the Constitution. And if you read
the instructions and the law that is provided to you in
this case, you will see this Court's words mirrored
back to you in the scheme of the Kansas law as it
relates to the death penalty.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General
Kline.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the case in the
