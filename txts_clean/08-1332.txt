(11:06 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear
argument next in Case 08-1332, the City of
Ontario v. Quon.
Mr. Richland.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RICHLAND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Under the less restrictive constitutional
standards applied when government acts as employer, as
opposed to sovereign, there was no Fourth Amendment
violation here.
First, Ontario Police Sergeant Jeff Quon had
no reasonable expectation of privacy vis-à-vis the
Ontario Police Department in text messages on his
department-issued pager in light of the operational
realities of his workplace, which included the explicit
no privacy in text messages policy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The written policy?
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The whole -- the
argument here, of course, is that that was modified by
the instructions he got from the lieutenant. Do we
follow the written policy or the policy they allegedly
enforced in practice?
MR. RICHLAND: That is the argument,
Mr. Chief Justice. But, in fact, there was no
inconsistency between the no privacy in text messages
aspect of the written policy and the oral information
he was given.
First of all, the written policy itself was
broad enough to cover text messages. It stated, for
example, at Appendix 152, that it applied to city-owned
computers and all associated equipment. And again at
2: "City-owned computer equipment, computer
peripheral, city networks, the Internet, e-mail, or
other city-related computer services." And, finally, the
agreement to the policy was that it applied -- this is
at Appendix 156 -- to city-owned computers and related
equipment.
So certainly the written policy itself was
broad enough to cover text messaging pagers, but in
addition to that, nothing in the oral statements made by
Lieutenant Duke undermined the no-privacy aspect of the
written policy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we are dealing
with Mr. Quon's reasonable expectations, right?
MR. RICHLAND: Yes, yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And even with the
written policy, he has the instructions -- everybody
agrees -- you can use this pager for private
communications.
MR. RICHLAND: That’s correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’re not going to
audit them. Right? That's what he said. He has to pay
for them. Right? Now, most things, if you're paying for
them, they’re yours. And this -- it particularly covered
messages off-duty.
Now, can't you sort of put all those
together and say that it would be reasonable for him to
assume that private messages were his business? They
said he can do it. They said, you’ve got to pay for
it. He used it off duty. They said they’re not going
to audit it.
MR. RICHLAND: Not when he was told at the
same time that these text messages were considered
e-mail and could be audited, and that they were
considered public records and could be audited at any
time; that is, it has to do with a different aspect of
what the policy -- the oral policy --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In addition to -- that
was said at the meeting -- and Lieutenant Duke, who was
the same one who later says: I'm not going to monitor
as long as you pay the difference. There was the
statement at the meeting by that same person. Wasn't
there something in writing by the police chief to follow
up after that meeting?
MR. RICHLAND: Yes, there was,
Justice Ginsburg. There was a memo that was sent that
memorialized the statements at the meeting, that
specifically stated that the text messages were treated
as e-mail under the written policy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me ask you --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me ask you to
put the written policy aside. Hypothetical case: There’s
no written policy. Would he have a reasonable
expectation in the privacy of his personal e-mail, text
messages, in that case?
MR. RICHLAND: Not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words,
all we know is the list that I went through earlier.
MR. RICHLAND: Yes. Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
Assuming all the other factors in this case were
present --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.
MR. RICHLAND: That is, he is using his
department-issued pager; he is a police officer and
indeed a member of the high-profile SWAT team of the
police department. He should be aware just by virtue of
that fact that there is going to be litigation involving
incidents that the SWAT team gets involved in where there
will be requests for the communications that are made on
that official department-issued pager.
And, in addition, he should be aware of the
fact -- and this is something that the dissenters to
denial of en banc said below. He should be aware that
there may be inquiries from boards of the police to
determine whether the conduct of the police in a particular
incident is appropriate.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Richland, a little
earlier you referred us to page 152 and 156 of --
MR. RICHLAND: Of the appendix to the
petition.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, the appendix to the
petition.
MR. RICHLAND: Yes, and that's the policy.
That is the written policy, Justice Scalia. I'm sorry
for the confusion.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that’s the
written policy.
MR. RICHLAND: That is the written policy,
and the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the policy
itself, from the point of view of Officer Quon, is a
little bit more complicated than that.
MR. RICHLAND: Well, of course, what the --
what Officer Quon's point of view is must also be
tempered by what we are reasonably going to accept as a
society of his understanding of the circumstances.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would agree, I
think, that if the SCA, the Stored Communications Act --
MR. RICHLAND: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If that made it illegal
to disclose these e-mails, then he would certainly be correct
that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy; isn't that
right?
MR. RICHLAND: No, Mr. Chief Justice. We
would not agree with that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not reasonable
to assume that people are going to follow the law?
MR. RICHLAND: Well, for several reasons.
Number one, this Court has repeatedly stated that the
mere fact that something is contrary to the law does not
in itself permit a reasonable expectation of privacy.
Just two terms ago, in Virginia v. Moore, this Court
said precisely that. And of course it said it earlier
in California v. Greenwood, and in a number of other
cases -- Oliver v. United States.
Because the effect of that, of course, would
mean that we would be constitutionalizing every positive
law that might be enacted by a State or the
Federal legislature.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on that point, do we
take it as the law of the case or as a given that it was
illegal for I think Arch to turn over the transcripts to
the police department? What do we do with that part of
the case?
MR. RICHLAND: Justice Kennedy, I don’t
believe it is law of the case that is binding on this
Court, since this Court is a higher court. Although it
is true that this Court denied certiorari on that issue,
I don't believe it is bound by the Ninth Circuit
determination of that, and in fact it is our contention
that that was incorrectly decided.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: On remand -- has there been
a final judgment issued as to Arch, or is that just
being held --
MR. RICHLAND: I don't believe so,
Justice Kennedy. I believe that everything has been
stayed pending the determination by this Court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, let's assume
that in this police department, everyone knew, the
supervisors and everyone else, that the police
department people spoke to their girlfriends at night.
MR. RICHLAND: Yes, Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And one of the chiefs,
out of salacious interest, decides: I'm going to just
go in and get those texts, those messages, because I
just have a prurient interest. Does that officer have
any expectation of privacy that his boss won't just
listen in out of prurient interest?
MR. RICHLAND: Justice Sotomayor, as to the
first aspect, the question of reasonable expectation of
privacy, the motive should have no impact. The motive
of looking should have no impact. The question of
reasonable expectation of privacy must be analyzed
according to the relationship between the officer and
his -- and his employer.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But if in fact -- and
whether we agree with this conclusion or not, we accept
the lower court's views that there was an expectation
that the chiefs were not going to read these things,
some expectation of privacy --
MR. RICHLAND: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the limits of it have
to be limited for all of the reasons you’ve said, doesn't
this case begin and end on whether or not what the jury
found is reasonable grounds for what the city did?
MR. RICHLAND: I think that what this case
begins and ends with, if we assume that there was a
reasonable expectation of privacy, is under the
plurality opinion in O'Connor: Whether the search
itself was reasonable. And the jury did, of course,
make a determination as to the purpose of the search.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we don't decide
our -- our Fourth Amendment privacy cases on the basis
of whether there -- there was an absolute guarantee of
privacy from everybody. I think -- I think those cases
say that if you think it can be made public by anybody,
you don't -- you don't really have a right of privacy.
So when the -- when the filthy-minded police
chief listens in, it's a very bad thing, but it's not --
it’s not offending your right of privacy. You expected
somebody else could listen in, if not him.
MR. RICHLAND: I think that's correct,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it is.
MR. RICHLAND: And I think the reason why
you must have the two-step analysis in a case of this
sort -- that is, first look at the question as to
whether there’s a reasonable expectation of privacy,
and then determine, if there was, whether the search was
reasonable -- is precisely for the reason that, without
that, what we will have in every case is the claim that
there was a salacious reason, that that was the reason.
And we’ll be litigating every one of those cases --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then, according to what
you just said, the jury determination was superfluous.
If there was no reasonable expectation of privacy
because the officers were told this is just -- we
treat this just like e-mails, it can be monitored, it
can be made public, then there would be no reasonable
expectation of privacy and there would be no question to
go to the jury.
MR. RICHLAND: That’s correct,
Justice Ginsburg. And it is our position that this
should never have gone to the jury, that summary
judgment should have been granted in favor of the
Ontario Police Department.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you have two arguments:
One, that it's -- there’s no reasonable expectation of
privacy; even if there were, that this was a reasonable
search.
MR. RICHLAND: That’s correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is reasonable expectation
of privacy a judge question or a jury question?
MR. RICHLAND: Well, if there is a conflict
in the facts, I presume the jury must resolve those --
that factual conflict. But in this case, I don't
believe there is a conflict in the facts, and, therefore,
it is a judge question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did your client
treat on-duty text messages different from off-duty text
messages?
MR. RICHLAND: It did, once there was an
initial determination made as to the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did it do that?
MR. RICHLAND: Excuse me. I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did it treat
them differently? Under your theory, they’re all the
same -- no expectation of privacy.
MR. RICHLAND: It treated them differently
out of -- because there were two aspects to the case.
One aspect was the initial determination that Chief
Sharp ordered to say: I just want to know, is our
character limit efficacious here, or do we need to have
a higher character limit? And for that purpose, they
needed to just look at all of them. And they did; they
looked at all of the text messages.
But then when they saw that some of them may
have involved violations of department regulations, then
it was sent to Internal Affairs, and they redacted the
off-duty messages because they were --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that something like the
plain view argument? In search and -- search and --
MR. RICHLAND: I suppose.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm serious. In
other words, there is, under your view --
MR. RICHLAND: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- legitimate grounds to
look at the messages, and then once they see it, they
don't have to ignore it.
MR. RICHLAND: I think that’s correct,
Justice Kennedy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why did -- I'm
sorry. I still don't understand. It redacted them,
right?
MR. RICHLAND: Redacted because the inquiry
-- the second stage of the inquiry in Internal Affairs --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.
MR. RICHLAND: -- was simply to determine how
much time was being spent on duty sending personal messages.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
MR. RICHLAND: So the Internal Affairs
Department said: We don't need to look at the off-duty
messages. We’re going to redact them. Why get into all
of that? We don't have to look.
The department was pretty scrupulous. And I
think that's part of what makes the entire approach that
they took to this reasonable. It makes the search
aspect of the case reasonable. And I think it's
important, in that regard, to look at the nature --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You said they
did get to the off-duty text messaging later?
MR. RICHLAND: No, it was the other way
around. They looked at the on-duty text messaging at
the later stage, at the Internal Affairs stage. But
they looked at all of the text messages when the only
purpose for the inquiry was to determine how many of the
text messages in general are job-related and how many
were personal? Because the question was: Do we need to
raise the character limit --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't have
to look at the messages to determine that with respect
to the off-duty messages, right?
MR. RICHLAND: Well -- well, you did,
because of the fact, Mr. Chief Justice, that there were
job-related communications even while there was
off-duty. These officers were SWAT team officers. They
were on duty, as Sergeant Quon said, 24/7. That was one
of the reasons why they had the text messaging pagers.
JUSTICE ALITO: If someone wanted to send a
message to one of these pagers, what sort of a device
would you need? Do you need to have another pager, or
can you -- could you send a message to one of these
devices from some other type of device?
MR. RICHLAND: No, there were messages that
were sent from various other devices. Is the question
whether that could be physically done, electronically
done? Because, yes, clearly that was --
JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. What other type of
device could you use to send a message to one of these
pagers?
MR. RICHLAND: It -- oh. I'm not certain
if it was something other than another text messaging
pager. It did appear that there were some e-mail
entries in the transcripts themselves, which suggested
that there might have been a way to communicate to them
with e-mail, but that's just -- that's all in the record
that suggests that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, if they were
on duty 24/7, there weren't any off-duty messages, were
there?
(Laughter.)
MR. RICHLAND: Well, I may have misspoke.
They were on call 24/7. They were the SWAT team, and
they had to respond to emergencies.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we take it that the
Stored Communications Act does say that the provider may
not give out the transcripts, if we take that as given,
then how can the department lawfully use the
transcripts?
MR. RICHLAND: Well, Justice Ginsburg, first
of all, there was no -- there is no current claim that
anything that the department did with respect to the
Stored Communications Act was unlawful. So it may be
that the other entity, Arch Wireless, violated the
Stored Communications Act, but that would not preclude
the department -- which was, after all, the subscriber
-- from requesting to see what, in fact, the transcripts
disclosed.
But in addition to that, there is also the
fact that, as I said before, a reasonable expectation of
privacy couldn't be based simply on the fact that there
was a statute, and particularly not a statute like the
Stored Communications Act, because that's a statute that’s
extremely, extremely technical. And there is a --
one has to determine whether an entity was working
either as an electronic communications service or a
remote computing service, and so on. Courts are all
over the board on this. As this Court noted in United
States v. Payner, a complicated law like that simply
cannot be the basis for a reasonable expectation of
privacy.
And if I may reserve the rest of my time,
thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly, counsel.
Mr. Katyal.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Millions of employees today use technologies
of their -- of their employers under policies
established by those employers. When a government
employer has a no-privacy policy in place that governs
the use of those technologies, ad hoc statements by a
non-policy member cannot create a reasonable expectation
of privacy. Put most simply, the computer help desk
cannot supplant the chief's desk. That simple, clear
rule should have decided this case.
Instead, the Ninth Circuit found that the
99 policy applied to pagers, but then concluded that
that 1999 policy was informally modified years later.
And that decision should be reversed. It disregards
this Court's repeated holdings, including 2 years ago in
the Chief Justice's opinion in Engquist v. Oregon about
the greater amount of leeway that the government has
when it acts as an employer. And it also is not
consistent with the plurality opinion in O'Connor, which
observed that when the government adopts a policy that
its employees lack privacy, no reasonable expectation of
privacy exists.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you this:
Suppose the department asks for opinion of legal
counsel whether or not transmittal of the transcripts by
Arch to the department was a violation of the Act, and
the counsel said: This was a violation of the Act; they
had no right to send them to you. Would the department
then still have had a right to look at the transcripts?
MR. KATYAL: So the question is if the
Stored Communications Act is violated?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Yes.
MR. KATYAL: We don't think the Stored
Communications Act was --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but -- no, my
hypothetical is that the -- that there is a legal
counsel's opinion that this was in violation of the Act,
and let's say the district court said it is in violation
of the Act. Let's say we say it’s in violation of the
Act. Is that the end of case? The department cannot
look at the transcripts?
MR. KATYAL: Oh, absolutely not. I mean, I
think this Court has repeatedly said that -- that
various privacy laws don't determine the scope of the
Fourth Amendment. I think it said so most clearly in
California v. Greenwood. And I think that's for a very
simple reason, that things like the Stored
Communications Act, Justice Kennedy, the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act, came about --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, California v.
Greenwood was a question of -- of a Fourth Amendment
standard that had to be nationwide. So you say it's the
same -- same thing here?
MR. KATYAL: I -- I do think it’s the same,
and for this simple reason, that when you have a
nationwide standard or a State standard, it’s to fill
the gap, whatever isn’t necessarily protected by the
Fourth Amendment. And here --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but Greenwood was in
the -- in the context of the exclusionary rule in
criminal proceedings. I certainly think that States --
at least we could make the reasonable argument that
States can have different policies with respect to their
employees, that have to be respected.
MR. KATYAL: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy. I
don't disagree with that. I think the only question is,
if the -- if I understand your question it’s, does a
Federal statute about privacy somehow matter to the
Fourth Amendment analysis about reasonable expectations
of privacy? And there our contention is, no; it’s
precisely because Congress enacted the Stored
Communications Act to fill gaps in Fourth Amendment law.
That -- that's why it's enacted.
And for -- for this Court to then use that
very Act to be the template on which reasonable
expectations of privacy may spring I think would be a
very -- it would be a novel proposition. Nor should --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's -- that's a
little bit puzzling because there are -- electronic
communications are stored all over the place in -- and
there isn't a history -- these are -- these are
relatively new. There isn't a well-established
understanding about what is private and what isn't
private. It's a little different from putting garbage
out in front of your house, which has happened for a
long time.
If -- if statutes governing the privacy of
that information don't have any bearing on reasonable
expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment, it's
some -- I -- I'm at something of a loss to figure out
how to determine whether there is a reasonable
expectation of privacy regarding any of those things.
MR. KATYAL: Well, Justice Alito, I do think
that the underlying premise of your question is one with
which we entirely agree. These are technologies that
are rapidly in flux, in which we don't have intuitive
understandings the way we do about, say, trash and so
on. And it's precisely for that reason I think the
Court should be very careful to constitutionalize and
generate Fourth Amendment rules in this area at the
first instance.
To do so I think really does freeze into --
into -- into place something that the legislature can't
then fix, going to Justice Kennedy's opinion in, for
example, Murray v. Giarratano, in which he said that
constitutionalizing in that area -- constitutionalizing
may pretermit legislative solutions.
Now, here the Stored Communications Act is
not violated under any way, shape, or form. The Stored
Communications Act has two different provisions in it,
one having to do with remote -- remote computing
services, RCSs. That's when an entity offers storage
facilities. And the other is for an electronic
communications service. That is essentially transmission
of messages from point to point.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your point that you
made just a moment ago, that we don't want to freeze into
place the constitutional requirements with respect to
new technology, I wonder if it cuts the other way. We’re
dealing with an amendment that looks to whether
something is reasonable. And I think it might be the
better course to say that the Constitution applies, but
we’re going to be more flexible in determining what’s
reasonable because they are dealing with evolving
technology.
MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that the -- the
best way -- I think the most -- the easiest way for the
Court to resolve this is to simply say that when we are
dealing with what is reasonable, we look to the policy.
And here there’s a policy by the employer, it says that
computer-associated -- computer-related equipment and
others, there’s no expectation of privacy. You have a
person who is told that repeatedly.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that puts
a lot of weight -- I mean, there are some things where we
don't bind them. You know, you get the usual parking
garage thing that has got all this small print on the
back. We -- we don't say that you’re bound by that,
because nobody reads it.
But in here, I just don't know. I just
don't know how you tell what’s reasonable -- I suspect
it might change with how old people are and how
comfortable they are with the technology -- when you have
all these different -- different factors.
You know, they’re told you can use it for
private; you’ve got to pay for it. I think if I pay for
it, it's mine, and it’s not the employer's.
MR. KATYAL: Well, I think the clearest way,
Mr. Chief Justice, to decide what is reasonable and what
isn't is actually the terms of the policy. And it seems
to me very little is more unreasonable than expecting
a right to privacy after you’ve been told in a
policy you have no privacy.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose we find a right of
privacy. Is that the end of the case? I mean, wouldn't
you also -- in order to sustain this lawsuit, wouldn't
you also have to find that it was an unreasonable --
MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. There are two
arrows in the city's quiver, and I think they're right
as to both of them. But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What’s the government's
position on the unreasonableness of the search?
MR. KATYAL: The government's position is
that the Ninth Circuit just from the get-go got the
standard wrong by citing -- by using a Schowengerdt test
which was, was this -- was this search the least
restrictive alternative? And we think this Court has
repeatedly said that's the wrong way of thinking about
it, that that puts judges in the position of
second-guessing searches on the ground, that they’re
not really fully -- fully equipped to do so.
So I do think that is a possible way to
resolve this, Justice Scalia, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe an easier way, huh?
MR. KATYAL: Well, I don't know that it's
easier, in the following sense: I think that thousands
of employers across the country rely on these policies
and millions of employees. And the Ninth Circuit's
decision puts that reliance in some jeopardy, because it
said that you can have an official policy and it can be
taken back by what some ad hoc subordinate says. And
that is, I think, a very destructive notion to the idea
of reliance on these policies and setting --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your -- your
position would require people basically to have two of
these things with them, two whatever they are,
text messager or the BlackBerries or whatever, right?
Because assuming they’re going to get personal things,
you know, some emergency at home, they’re also going to
get work things --
MR. KATYAL: To the -- under this policy,
yes. You might have an employer that sets a different
policy and allows for some de minimis use and a zone of
privacy in that use. You can have a variety of
different things. But what I think would be dangerous
is to have a blanket rule that constitutionalizes and
says you always have reasonable expectations of privacy
in this technology. The result may be,
Mr. Chief Justice, that employers then won't give that
technology at all to their employees and -- and
eliminate even that de minimis use.
Mr. Chief Justice, you had also asked before
about the standpoint of Quon in -- in evaluating
the reasonableness of the search -- of the search in his
perspective of the policy. We think that is the wrong
way of looking at it. Instead, we think the proper test
is the written policy, what it says, and that is the
simplest way, I think, to provided administrability to
the lower courts. They can simply say was this policy
in existence, and not get into those questions of is it
like a parking ticket, did I flip through it too
quickly, did I understand that the policy and the like.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You want to -- you want
to -- you want to undo O'Connor's operational realities
of the workplace and say the minute you issued a written
policy that renders all searches okay, even if the
operational realities are different?
MR. KATYAL: Not at all, Justice Sotomayor.
I take it the language about operational realities in
the workplace, what is right next to it is looking to
whether or not there are regulations in place, and here
a policy is a regulation. And so --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You may have an argument
that the nature of the policy here and all of the
activities related to it don't prove an operational
reality of privacy, but I don't know why -- you want a
flat rule that says once you have a written policy,
there’ no expectation of privacy.
MR. KATYAL: And I think that is -- that is
what O'Connor says with respect to the -- as long as the
policy is in place, that -- that's what O'Connor
permits.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Dammeier.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DIETER DAMMEIER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. DAMMEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
I think an underlying fact that we might be
skipping over is -- is -- and both the lower courts
recognize this -- that the computer policy that the
department had didn't apply to the pagers on its own.
It -- it only came into play after Lieutenant Duke
modified that policy and told people at the -- at the
meeting that was referred to earlier that the pagers are
now going to be applying with -- with this policy.
It -- it --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is -- why is that so?
I mean, it did say associated equipment. And -- and if
an employee is told now e-mails aren't private, so we’re
warning you, we can monitor them, wouldn't such an
employee expect the same thing to apply to the pager?
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, the policy itself has
two components to it. One is, don't use our equipment,
all associated equipment for personal business.
The other part of that policy deals with the
no privacy, and it informs the people there could be
monitoring. And specifically on the acknowledgment form
of that policy, which is at Appendix 156 of the
petition, it specifically says the city will
periodically monitor e-mail, Internet use, and computer
usage.
And -- and, again, I think this is why the --
both lower courts came to the conclusion that the
computer policy on its own wasn't in play until
Lieutenant Duke announced that, hey, now the pagers are
going -- are going to be in play with this computer
policy. This is the same Lieutenant Duke --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But my question is, an
employee reads this policy and says, oh, my e-mails are
going to be subject to being monitored --
MR. DAMMEIER: Sure.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't that employee
expect that the policy would carry over to pagers? I mean,
would -- when you think of what's the reason why they want
to look at the e-mails, wouldn't the same reason apply?
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, I'm sure the same
reasons could apply, but the -- the city is the one that
writes the rules here. The -- if they want to make it
clear on what it applies to, it certainly should be on
them to write them clear so the employee understands.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe -- maybe
everybody else knows this, but what is the difference
between a pager and e-mail?
MR. DAMMEIER: Sure. The e-mail, looking at
the computer policy -- that goes through the city's
computer, it goes through the city's server, it goes
through all the equipment that -- that has -- that the
city can easily monitor. Here the pagers are a separate
device that goes home with you, that travels with you,
that you can use on duty, off duty, and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can do that with
e-mails.
MR. DAMMEIER: Certainly, certainly. But in
this -- in this -- in this instance with the pagers, it went
through no city equipment; it went through Arch Wireless
and then was transmitted to another -- another person.
So, again, to Duke -- Duke is the one that
said: Hey, this -- this comes into play. But
Lieutenant Duke is also the one that gave the privacy
guarantee to the SWAT team members and said: As long as
you pay the overages, we’re not going to look at your
pagers; we're not going to look at the messages. So if
-- if you couple both of those modifications, both by
the same lieutenant -- and he wasn't just some
subordinate; he was the lieutenant in charge of the
administrative bureau; he was the administrative bureau
commander.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that he said --
he was saying: But as far as billing is concerned, I'm
not going to look at these; if you use more than 25,000
characters, you pay the extra, and that will be the end
of it. If you contest that, then I’ll look to see
whether those in excess of 25,000 characters were for
work purposes or private purposes.
And so he's talking about the billing. He
hasn't retracted what was said at the meeting about -- that
these text messages are subject to audit.
MR. DAMMEIER: This -- this is what Sergeant
Quon testified to, that he attributed to Lieutenant
Duke: If you don't want us to read it, pay the overage
fee.
JUSTICE BREYER: But what’s wrong with his
deciding: I don't like to do this anymore? I don't
want to collect all this money; it's too complicated;
and so I don't know how many of these messages are
related to work and how many they are just mucking
around prying into each other's business.
MR. DAMMEIER: He can certainly --
JUSTICE BREYER: So I would like to know, so
therefore I'm going to look and see. Now, what’s
unreasonable about that?
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, he certainly could say
I don't want to do this anymore, and he could --
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no.
MR. DAMMEIER: And he could tell everybody.
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying what's
-- the city owns the pager. It's a pager used for work.
They are giving a privilege to people if they want to
use it off work. It seems to be involving a big amount
of collection, and so what he wants to do is he wants to
see how much of this is being used for work and how much
is of this not being used for work.
My question, which I just repeated, is why
is that an unreasonable thing?
MR. DAMMEIER: I don't think that request is
unreasonable, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. And then if that’s
not unreasonable, why is what went on here that is
any different?
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, here the jury -- the
only fact that was determined by the jury was the reason
for the search. And that's found at the appendix to the
petition page 119. This is the only finding that the
jury made as to the purpose of the search: To determine
the efficacy of the existing character limits to ensure
that officers were not being required to pay for the
work-related expenses.
JUSTICE BREYER: How does that differ from
what I just said?
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, it -- it comes into
play on -- on the scope of the search. Again --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, I understand. I thought
it's just a more -- a few more words to say just what I
said. That they wanted to look into this because they
are tired about collecting so much money.
It's the third time I've said the same
thing; probably it's my fault I’m not being clear. But
it looked as if they wanted to know how many are being
sent for work purposes, how many for private purposes
including prying into people's business, which wasn't
too desirable, and -- and -- so that they could get
the -- the charges right.
Now, that sounds like what the jury said they
were doing, too. And my question was -- I don't see
anything, quite honestly, unreasonable about that, where
you’re the employer, where it's a SWAT team, where --
where -- where you’re paying for this in the first
place. So the reason I ask it is I would like you
clearly to explain what's unreasonable about it.
MR. DAMMEIER: The scope of the search was
unreasonable.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the conclusion. Now,
what's your reason?
MR. DAMMEIER: Under -- under -- looking at
O'Connor, you have to -- you have to look to make sure
that the search is not excessively intrusive. Here,
what they did was they took all the messages and started
reading them. Given the purpose, the limited purpose
that was found by the jury for the search, they didn't
need to do that.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, explain that one to
MR. DAMMEIER: They --
JUSTICE BREYER: Being naive about this, if
I had a -- like, 20, 30,000 characters in 1,800 messages
and I wanted to know which are personal and which are
work-related, a good way to get at least a good first
cut would be to read them.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay? So I start off
thinking that seems to be reasonable to me. That's what
I would do.
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, that's certainly one --
JUSTICE BREYER: So all right. Now you tell
me why that isn't reasonable.
MR. DAMMEIER: That's one of the ways they
could have done it. They could have got -- they could
have got consent from the officers first to do it. They
could have had the officers themselves count the
messages. After all, the officers were the ones that
were paying for the overages.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But the
officers might say: I don't want you to read these
messages because they happen to be about the sexual
activity of some of my coworkers and their wives and me,
which happened to be the case here.
MR. DAMMEIER: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: So I guess if you had asked
for consent, the officer would have said no.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, he says, I still want to
know. I will be repeating it. All right. So what -- that
didn't sound very practical. What's the other way?
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, they could have -- they
could have had the officers themselves count the
messages.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the officer is going
to say, hey, these are all big -- work-related. I’ll
tell you that. I only had two.
MR. DAMMEIER: Well --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What's a third way?
MR. DAMMEIER: Okay. They -- the lieutenant
could have said, hey, we're going to stop this practice
that I started, and from this month forward make sure
all you do is business-related. No more --
JUSTICE BREYER: That would have been rough
on them. Because you want to let them have a few; you
need pizza when you’re out on duty. You want to -- there
are --
MR. DAMMEIER: The --
JUSTICE BREYER: Look, so far I listened to four
things, and I'm just being naive about it. I’ll read it
more closely, but I don't see why these four things are
so obviously more reasonable than what they did.
MR. DAMMEIER: They also -- they could have
had the officers redact the private messages and then
given it -- given it to the department.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But suppose that their
application of what -- how much was being spent on
business-related, all of your suggestions about having
the officer do things does nothing about their application.
MR. DAMMEIER: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You’re -- you’re
relying on the very person you’re auditing to do the
audit for you. That doesn't seem either practical or
business-wise.
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, other than my one
sample of -- example of saying, hey, let's -- let's stop
the personal use and we’re going to have a test month
to determine exactly how many messages we need for our
business-related purposes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That goes back to -- I
don't understand that. You’re still relying on the
person you’re auditing to say to you I’m only using
it for business. That -- that's just not logical.
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, but the -- the sole
purpose of the search was only to find out if officers
were paying for business-related messages that they
didn't need to pay for.
JUSTICE BREYER: But the question, in the
Constitution, the word is "unreasonable." Is it a
reasonable or unreasonable? So the question -- what I
asked is not maybe you would have gotten a better result
if you had hired Bain Associates and Bain would have
done a 4-month study at a cost of $50,000.
But I could say a person who doesn't want
to hire Bain and who doesn't want to rely on the
unverified word of the officers who were using these for
God knows what is not being unreasonable. That's the
ultimate issue. And that's why I’m putting it to you
to show me that what they did was unreasonable.
MR. DAMMEIER: I think it comes down from
that perspective on the excessiveness of the search.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The only reason --
the only reason the officer would not be accurate -- I
mean, I don't understand why the redaction is such a bad
idea. He just says these are private. And that allows
-- and then you could look at everything else. You can
see if he's going too far because then everything else
would be there. But in terms of -- the jury found this
was not done to find out what was in the messages, so
they don't need to find out what’s in the messages.
That's just a question. He has to pay for everything he
-- he redacts.
MR. DAMMEIER: That -- that's exactly what
we’re saying. I mean, the interest here is -- is for
the officer to be upfront as far as what’s
business-related to -- if he's paying for things that he
shouldn't be paying for, I'm sure he would -- he would be
forthright about that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, it's no
different than the police coming in and saying, well,
we’re going to look at, you know, what's in every drawer
and then -- you know, then if it turns out to be
personal and private, we won't -- you know, we won't --
it just happens that we came upon, I guess, is
Justice Kennedy's point. It's kind of the plain view
doctrine, except they get to decide how broad what they
can view is.
MR. DAMMEIER: That's true. I agree with
that.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you this question
about the basic background of a reasonable expectation
of privacy? This is SWAT team work. Supposing it was an
officer answering 911 calls or things like that. Isn't
there sort of a background expectation that sooner or
later, somebody might have to look at communications for
this particular kind of law enforcement officer?
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, certainly -- certainly
that could happen in any number of --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, wouldn't you just
assume that that whole universe of conversations by SWAT
officers who are on duty 24/7 might well have to be
reviewed by some member of the public or some of their
superiors?
MR. DAMMEIER: But that -- that could be a
possibility on any -- on anything that they do in their
lives, whether it be their personal life or --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but it's over
official -- it's over the official communications
equipment that they use for purposes of law enforcement.
MR. DAMMEIER: Correct. Correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I certainly -- criminal
defense attorneys challenging probable cause would want
to look at these. They would want to see if there is
exonerating evidence, under the rule that all
exonerating evidence has to be submitted. It would seem
to me that it's quite likely, as Justice Stevens'
question indicates, that there is going to -- that these
are going to be discoverable.
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, it's just like my mail
that I might send out to somebody. It might be
discoverable in litigation, but that doesn't --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you’re not -- you’re
not a police officer who is making arrests. I mean,
this -- this is part and parcel of determining probable
cause and mitigating evidence.
MR. DAMMEIER: No, it -- obviously, there
are different reasons that could come into play that
would legally produce these messages, certainly.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dammeier, you could say
the same thing about private phones. There are
obviously circumstances in which whether you were making
a call between certain times becomes relevant to
litigation. So you could say that destroys the
expectation of privacy? I'm not sure. I hope we don't
say that.
MR. DAMMEIER: No. No. It's like -- this
-- in O'Connor, all nine Justices in O'Connor found an
expectation of privacy in Dr. Ortega's desk, because
even though it was a state-owned desk, you still have an
expectation of privacy.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but there’s no
normal reason for going through somebody's desk; whereas,
there would be a very ordinary -- ordinary reason for
reviewing calls made to the SWAT -- members of the SWAT
team, it seems to me.
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, there are -- as talked
about in O'Connor, there are certainly a lot of valid
reasons to go through a public employee's desk, if you’re
looking for a file or if you’re looking for --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. DAMMEIER: Or for -- or for an
investigation. But still, there was that expectation of
privacy. You’re talking about employees that -- in
today's society, I think work and private life get
melded together. Here, we’re talking about SWAT people
/7 --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, to say that there’s
an expectation of privacy in the desk doesn't say that
every intrusion into that expectation of privacy is an
unreasonable one. There could be that expectation of
privacy and, still, for some reason -- let's assume there
has been a theft in the building, and it's known that
what was taken has not gotten out of the building. It's
conceivable that that would be a valid reason to intrude
upon the expectation of privacy, right?
MR. DAMMEIER: Correct. I don't think we’re
taking away the government's ability to do searches
under proper circumstances.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why isn't this a
proper circumstance?
MR. DAMMEIER: The initial circumstance
might be proper, but how they effectuated it was not.
It was excessively intrusive. They did not -- the
purpose was to find out if they were paying for enough
work-related messages. They did not need to look at
these, what they knew were going to be private messages.
They knew -- the lieutenant had this arrangement that they
could use this for personal purposes. They knew what
they were going to be looking at.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't know which ones
were private messages, did they?
MR. DAMMEIER: Not until they read them.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not until they read them.
MR. DAMMEIER: But there certainly -- they
certainly knew what might be coming because of the
arrangement that Lieutenant Duke had in place.
Here -- here I think that’s --
JUSTICE ALITO: What was the arrangement
that Lieutenant Duke had in place? I thought all he
said was: I don't have an intent to read these,
because it's too much trouble, so if you go over and you
pay me the extra, I'm not going to read them.
MR. DAMMEIER: His --
JUSTICE ALITO: Did he ever say that -- that
I'm not -- that you have a privacy right in these
things?
MR. DAMMEIER: No, but according -- according
to Sergeant Quon's testimony, he told him: As long as you
pay the overages, we’re not going to read them. And that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did he say "we"? He -- even
Quon didn't say that. Duke said he wouldn't do it. But
earlier, the -- at the meeting, the statement was made
that these are open to audit. Didn't say only by
Lieutenant Duke.
MR. DAMMEIER: True. True. I agree. But
it was Lieutenant Duke, the one that was making the
announcement that now these pagers are going to fall
under the computer policy, the same lieutenant who then
gave the assurance that as long as you pay the overages,
we’re not -- we’re not going to look at them.
I mean, when you’re talking about the
operational reality of O'Connor, that was the
operational reality. The SWAT members knew: As long as
I pay the overages, my messages aren't going to be
reviewed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happens, just
out of curiosity, if you're -- he is on the pager and
sending a message and they’re trying to reach him for,
you know, a SWAT team crisis? Does he -- does the one
kind of trump the other, or do they get a busy signal?
MR. DAMMEIER: I don't think that's in the
record. However, my understanding is that you would get
it in between messages. So messages are going out and
coming in at the same time, pretty much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And would you know
where the message was coming from?
MR. DAMMEIER: I believe so. It identifies
where it's coming from. It identifies the number of
where it's coming from. If you know the number, you
know where it's coming from.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And he's talking with
a girlfriend, and he has a voice mail saying that your
call is very important to us; we’ll get back to you?
(Laughter.)
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, I think with the text
messages -- and that's what we are talking about the
transcripts of, were the text messages that were data
transferred from device to device, and here, you know,
we come back to -- I did want to touch a little bit on
the Stored Communications Act having play on somebody’s
expectation of privacy -- you know, it's -- lawfully,
those messages were protected. And I think, looking at
people's expectation of privacy, that should be a
component. It certainly may be not the end-all to the
question, but it should be a factor in determining
whether or not there’s going to be an expectation of
privacy.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- did he know about
that statute? I didn't know about it.
MR. DAMMEIER: That's not in -- that's not
in the record. That is not in the record. But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can we assume he didn't?
MR. DAMMEIER: Right. Well, we can assume
that, but we also --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And what difference would that
make?
MR. DAMMEIER: I still don't think anything,
given the operational realities --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don’t see how it can affect
his expectation of privacy, if he didn't even know about it.
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, it's -- it's just like
the California Public Records Act. We should also
assume he didn't know about that as well, because the --
Petitioners make an argument that because there is this
California Public Records Act, that that may diminish
one's expectation of privacy. Certainly, if we’re
going to have that, then we should also be having the
Stored Communications Act that might enhance the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ignorance of the law is no
excuse, is what you’re saying?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any theory,
or do you make any argument that Florio, Trujillo, and
Quon's wife can succeed in their Fourth Amendment
claims, if Quon can't?
MR. DAMMEIER: I do. We, in our brief, try
to analogize that to the mail. I think when they sent
messages to -- to Sergeant Quon, that was a letter that
I sent. And here, the department didn't go get that
letter from Sergeant Quon after -- after delivery,
meaning go get it from his pager. They went to the
equivalent of the Post Office, which was Arch Wireless,
and got a copy off of their server. So I -- I think --
and, again, analogizing to the mail, they have an
expectation of privacy while that message is in the
course of delivery.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose it was
perfectly clear that -- I mean, suppose that the department
gave Mr. Quon a policy -- a statement that says: Sign
this, you acknowledge that your pager is to be used only
for work and that you have no privacy interest in it
whatsoever; we’re going to monitor this every day.
And then these other individuals sent him messages.
You would still say they have an expectation
of privacy in those messages?
MR. DAMMEIER: Until the point that it’s on
Quon's pager. I think under that scenario, that they
could have obtained the messages from Quon, but they
went over to Arch, the equivalent of the Post Office,
and got them from them.
It's like if I -- I make a copy of a letter
before I send it to somebody. You know, down the road,
I might not know what happens and I might lose my
expectation of privacy down the road, but that copy I
kept, I think there is still an expectation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what -- when you send
a text message to somebody else, aren't you quite aware
that that text message will remain confidential only to
the extent that either the recipient keeps it
confidential -- and he can disclose it -- or somebody
else who has power over the recipient or over the
recipient's phone chooses to look at it? Don't -- isn't
that understood when you send somebody a text message?
MR. DAMMEIER: I -- I agree with that, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so she should have
understood that, you know, whoever could get ahold of
his phone lawfully can read the message. In other
words, I don't see that she's in a -- in a different
position from Quon himself.
MR. DAMMEIER: I think it's just a slightly
different one. I mean, first of all, they didn't
lawfully get it; there was a violation of the Stored
Communications Act to get it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a different
issue.
MR. DAMMEIER: But here, again, had they
gotten consent from -- from Quon and got it from him
directly, that's a -- that's a different story.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, again, it depends
upon their reasonable expectation. Do any of these
other people know about Arch Wireless? Don't they just
assume that once they send something to Quon, it's going
to Quon?
MR. DAMMEIER: That's -- that is true. I
mean, they expect --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then they
can't have a reasonable expectation of privacy based on
the fact that their communication is routed through a
communications company.
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, they -- they expect
that some company, I'm sure, is going to have to be
processing the delivery of this message. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I didn't -- I
wouldn't think that. I thought, you know, you push a
button; it goes right to the other thing.
(Laughter.)
MR. DAMMEIER: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean it doesn't go
right to the other thing?
(Laughter.)
MR. DAMMEIER: It's -- I mean, it's like
with e-mails. When we send an e-mail, that goes through
some e-mail provider, whether it be AOL or Yahoo. It's
going through some service provider. Just like when
we send a letter or package, it's going through -- some
provider is going to move that for us, until it gets to
the end recipient. And like the mail, that message enjoys
an expectation of privacy while it's with the Post
Office --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you print these things
out? Could Quon print these -- these spicy
conversations out and circulate them among his buddies?
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, he could have
ultimately, sure.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --
MR. DAMMEIER: And -- and like, when I get a
piece of mail from somebody, I could do that as well,
but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to
the Post Office and get my mail before I get it. I
think -- I think that, you know, certainly adds a little
bit to the correspondence that dealt with --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just -- just to
be clear: You think if these messages went straight to
Quon that there’d be no problem from the point of
view of the senders? I mean, no problem in searching --
getting them from Quon?
MR. DAMMEIER: I think it's certainly a
harder argument for me to make --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.
MR. DAMMEIER: -- that they have an
expectation after -- after Quon has it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have to assume
for your argument to succeed that they know that this goes
somewhere else and then it’s processed and then it goes
to Quon.
MR. DAMMEIER: Yes, but I think in today's
-- I think in today's society that's -- that's a
reasonable assumption to make. One --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I didn't know.
MR. DAMMEIER: I think it might have been
Florio testified that she actually called her carrier to
find out, you know, if -- if the messages that she would
transmit would be maintained and that was -- that they
didn't maintain a copy. So there was some understanding
of how the process worked.
JUSTICE ALITO: Can an officer who has one
of these pagers delete messages from the pager --
MR. DAMMEIER: Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO: -- so that they can't be
recovered by the department if the pager is turned into
the department?
MR. DAMMEIER: Sure. Yes.
JUSTICE ALITO: They can delete them?
MR. DAMMEIER: They can delete them. Just
like if they received a letter, they could be put in the
shredder.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I sent somebody a
letter and -- and I have privacy in that letter, and
let's assume it’s intercepted at the Post Office, but I
have also published the letter in a letter to the editor
of the newspaper. I have written the following letter
to Sergeant Quon. Do I still have a right -- a right of
privacy in that letter?
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, I think then certainly
your expectation may be diminished.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that's the
situation here. The -- the central location that stores
the message is one thing, but she's made -- made the
message public effectively by sending it to Quon. Once
it gets to Quon, she knows that Quon can make it public
or that the employer can -- can find out about it.
MR. DAMMEIER: But that would create a
free-for-all in service providers. If -- if while this
message, after it’s sent and it’s in transit --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. DAMMEIER: It's a free-for-all. The
government could just go in and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. That -- and
that's why you have the statute, because the Fourth
Amendment wouldn't solve the problem, because you are
effectively making it public by sending it to somebody
whom you don't know is immune from disclosure. So, in
order to stop the intermediary from making it public,
you needed the statute. Otherwise you wouldn't need it;
the Fourth Amendment would solve the problem, right?
MR. DAMMEIER: Well, certainly, obviously
the statute could come into play in addition to the
Fourth Amendment. But here, you know, I come back to
the mail analogy. Just because at the end of the line
somebody might disseminate my letter doesn't lose an
expectation in the copy that I make that I may keep or
that in the course of delivery the Post Office might
keep. I still enjoy an expectation -- and the Fourth
Amendment certainly protects that copy, that either I
kept or the Post Office is keeping in the course of
delivery.
Certainly, at the end of the line, that letter
could be published to the world, but that's not the same
thing as the government coming in and getting a copy of
it while it was being delivered.
JUSTICE ALITO: Are you sure that -- are you
sure about your answer to the question of deletion?
It's not like deleting something from a computer which
doesn't really delete it from the computer?
MR. DAMMEIER: Honestly, I'm not -- that's
not in the record, and the -- how that pager works as
far as deleting, I couldn't be certain that it would be
deleted forever. I would certainly not.
One -- one of the points to -- to raise,
too, was that most of these texts took place off duty
when dealing with Sergeant Quon. So, again, back to
looking at the actual practice that O'Connor has us look
at, you know, here again --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought the factual
record was the opposite, that in fact most of the calls
were -- not most, but a huge number of calls were
happening on duty.
MR. DAMMEIER: There were -- there were a
large number on-duty. I think it was broken down to
where the average was 27 in a work shift and the most on
one day was 80. But also they talked about -- they took
about 15 seconds. So you’re talking about an average
of about 7 minutes during -- during a work day.
But the testimony of Sergeant Quon was that
most of these were actually off-duty. And, you know, I
certainly -- I think that should come into play, given
the department -- they gave them pagers. And it wasn't
a one-way use; it wasn't, hey, this is, you know, for the
benefit of the employee. The department received a benefit.
I mean, they wanted to be able to have these SWAT guys
show up quickly, respond quickly, and there was a mix on
-- on the reasons for these pagers.
The exchange was, we’re going to let you
use these for personal purposes, and given that reality,
you should be able to have some -- some expectation of
privacy in that use. It's like if I pick up a phone and
I'm a public employee and I call my wife, I should be
able to have some expectation of privacy in a
conversation, especially given, you know -- you talk
about guys that are on 24/7. Do they have no private
life, now? Do they not have --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the policy was
limited personal use.
MR. DAMMEIER: The computer policy was
limited personal use. Again, depending on how that
comes into play with what Lieutenant Duke --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the notice was
we’re going to treat these just like e-mails, and
e-mails were limited personal use.
MR. DAMMEIER: Correct. With -- with the
additional modification by -- by Duke, that you could
also use them for personal purposes, from day one when
the pagers were issued.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. DAMMEIER: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Richland, you
have 3 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHARDS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RICHLAND: Thank you. I would first
like to just make it clear that what it is being claimed
was the guarantee of privacy by Lieutenant Duke is
really absolutely not that at all. And I would refer
the Court to Joint Appendix page 40, which does summarize
that, and it says -- here is what precisely what
Lieutenant Duke said: "Because of the overage
Lieutenant Duke went to Sergeant Quon and told him the
city-issued two-way pagers were considered e-mail and
could be audited." So that's what he said first.
Then he said -- he told Sergeant Quon it was
not his -- his intent to audit employees' text messages
to see if the overages were due to work-related
transmissions.
He advised Sergeant Quon he, Sergeant Quon,
could reimburse the city for the overages so he, Duke,
would not have to audit the transmission and see how
many messages were non-work-related. Lieutenant Duke
told Sergeant Quon he is doing this because if anybody
wished to challenge their overage, he could audit the
text transmissions to verify how many were
non-work-related, and then, finally, Lieutenant Duke
added, the text messages were considered public records
and could be audited at any time.
That is what is being characterized as a
guarantee of privacy. It's hard to see how that in any
way undercuts the official written policy.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Richland, do you take
any position on whether Jerilyn Quon, April Florio, and
Steve Trujillo stand in the same position as Sergeant
Quon insofar as this lawsuit is concerned?
MR. RICHLAND: We do, with respect -- in at
least one respect, and that is: If Sergeant Quon loses,
then we think the other plaintiffs must also lose.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?
MR. RICHLAND: Yes. The reason for that is
that this Court has held on many occasions that, once
one has sent a communication or an object to another
person, they lose their expectation of privacy in --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That means the
government can set up an interception mechanism on
telephone transmissions, on e-mail, computer
transmissions --
MR. RICHLAND: It -- it does not mean that,
Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it doesn't mean that,
answer his argument that, yes, you could take anything
from Quon, but the storage -- you went to the storage
facility, which is a Post Office.
MR. RICHLAND: And he says it's a Post
Office, but the truth is that all of these plaintiffs
admitted that they knew that this was a
department-issued pager, and this wasn't a Post Office.
Arch Wireless was the department's agent.
These text messages were being sent to
someplace. Both the written policy and the oral policy
indicated that they were being stored ---
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you have to get
into who owned --
MR. RICHLAND: Excuse me.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whether this was a -- we
have to get into the Storage Act and figure out whether
this was an RCN or ACS?
MR. RICHLAND: Well, I think that -- I
don't know that it's necessary to do that, because I
think that all that must be determined is -- and I don't
think whether it's an ECS or RCS is -- you would require
that to determine who owned it, because it was clear
that Arch acted solely as the city's agent.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Whoa, whoa. I'm not sure
you’re doing the city a favor by making Arch the city's
agent --
MR. RICHLAND: I understand --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- as opposed to an
independent contractor who is doing business with the
city.
MR. RICHLAND: The point is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You sure you want to live
with that?
MR. RICHLAND: I don't mean "agent" in -- in
the most literal sense, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.
MR. RICHLAND: What I mean is that they
were -- in effect, when there was a delivery to Arch
Wireless, it was a delivery to the city. And all of
these individuals knew that this was city equipment, and,
therefore, this was being delivered to the city.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
